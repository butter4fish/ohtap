## Creating subcorpora

### Version 1

Run `python subcorpora_tool/find_subcorpora_v1.py -d corpus_directory_name -w keywords_file.txt -m metadata_file.csv`.

You need to pass in three arguments: the directory where the subcorpora files are located (`-d`), the  text file where the keywords are located (`-w`), and the CSV file where the metadata for the corpora is located (`-m`).
