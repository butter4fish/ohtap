 COOK: Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. You hear less and less blatant harassment. There may be that, but it&#039;s not quite as--the physicality of it doesn&#039;t come in anymore, I&#039;ll tell you that right now. First time that happens, that guy is usually gone. LI: Right. Right. COOK: Yes. Or fined a whole lot. LI: Right. Whereas before, that used to happen and-- COOK: Who cares? LI: Yes.

You only have to tell me what your comfortable with, but people would meet up, and they&#039;d start relationships or-- ESSER: Oh, yeah. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s any different then as it is today. They had those, what do you call, double bottom. REDMAN: Okay, tell me what that is.

GEE: There was a lot of sexual harassment, but we just accepted it. You wouldn&#039;t accept it, the nonsense that I even went through when I started working. [laughs] It&#039;s really changed. A lot of sexual harassment, yes. But that&#039;s the way society was. MCGARRIGLE: There was no recourse, then. GEE: Oh, of course not. You gave in in order to continue. MCGARRIGLE: I would think that would further bind you to your women friends. GEE: That&#039;s part of it. It&#039;s true. I guess that&#039;s true, but we didn&#039;t even know. We didn&#039;t even think about it. We wanted to finish and do well, and get our wings, so you took anything anyone gave you, anyone, any nonsense. No one had to go to bed with anyone. MCGARRIGLE: That&#039;s what I was going to ask you. GEE: I don&#039;t think so. Some of them, I&#039;m sure there were romances and things of that sort, but you could get washed out. If you were caught with an instructor, you could be washed out, so people were very cautious about that. And some people were. MCGARRIGLE: And somehow it stopped short of this requirement that the women pilots sleep with the instructor. GEE: So they could pass. MCGARRIGLE: Didn&#039;t go that far. GEE: Oh, no. It wouldn&#039;t have paid off either, because if you were not any good, you had check rides by the Army, and there was no sleeping with the men who gave you the check rides who were in the service, because they were--sounds ridiculous, but they were all married men and they&#039;d really had little social interaction with us, just to check you out, so that you&#039;d go on to the next step. Or, if you had a accident, they check you out to see whether you&#039;re really a decent pilot or not.

JACKSON: [laughs] Yeah, they got along just fine. I think some were too friendly. REDMAN: Let&#039;s talk about that. JACKSON: [laughs] REDMAN: So there was some hanky panky at the shipyards? JACKSON: Oh, yeah. Yeah. REDMAN: Tell me a little bit about what that was like. JACKSON: Well, I know I knew about it. We worked around a lot of the pipe welders, pipe fitters, and they were the worst of the bunch. [laughs] REDMAN: In terms of their sense of humor? JACKSON: Well, just, you know. You have to control. You know how much you can do and if you want to do, whatever. You have to just say, you know, &quot;I&#039;m married, I&#039;m not interested.&quot; REDMAN: So men would make passes or advances at you. JACKSON: Yes. REDMAN: But the pipefitters were especially bad. JACKSON: Yes. [laughs] REDMAN: How did that make you feel as far as-- Did that ever make you or some of your women friends, did you ever feel uncomfortable with that environment, or was it something that you laughed off? JACKSON: Oh just, you know, just put it aside and go on. Do what you have to do. You know yourself what you want to do, so you just put it aside and say, go on with my work. REDMAN: Right.

DUNHAM: Sometimes we&#039;ve heard stories, particularly--and you came in &#039;43, but even then--of men sometimes making it pretty difficult on the women, too. We don&#039;t necessarily call it harassment, from that period, but there were certainly stories of harassment or hazing or teasing and things of that nature. Did you experience any of that, or observe it? SAMSON: I never had that experience, and I don&#039;t think we really had a problem with that. Of course, I was only seventeen years old, so they treated me like their little sister or something a lot. But I never noticed anything with the other, the older; there were a lot of older women, wives, that their husband had gone on to the service and everything. I don&#039;t think the men there really resented us at all. There was a little difference, like [President] Obama&#039;s worried about now, in wages. It was harder for us maybe to advance than had it been a young man. But that wasn&#039;t the people we worked with&#039;s fault.

TIDMORE: I don&#039;t think so. I do remember, when I was driving staff car, I had to pick up two girls that were gay. I was so naÃƒÂ¯ve; I didn&#039;t have any idea what was going on. But they were being discharged. They found out they were gay, and they were being discharged. They were in the back of the station wagon, and I had to take them over to the captain&#039;s office. DUNHAM: How did you find out that they were gay? TIDMORE: Well, they told me. They told me that&#039;s what was happening to them, that they were gay and they were being discharged. And I don&#039;t have any idea who they were or anything. I was just shocked. DUNHAM: Had you known of any other gays or lesbians growing up? TIDMORE: No. I don&#039;t think I knew any of--I did think, now as I think back, that there probably were a number of them, you know. But in the group that I ran around with there weren&#039;t any. And none of my group ever got harassed, sexually harassed or anything. So, I don&#039;t know.

TIDMORE: There&#039;s still a lot of discrimination against the girls. And it&#039;s too bad. They&#039;re really good. Now they have to be as good as the men. And in most cases, I think--the ones that I know are. And they don&#039;t always get a fair shake. The make it up to colonel, like in the Marine Corps. But that&#039;s just about as far as they get. There are some generals; there are a few but not a lot. I just think that they have a hard time. And I know that the girls that are out in Iraq and Afghanistan, I know that there&#039;s a lot of sexual harassment, should we say? I guess that&#039;s what it&#039;s going to be. I don&#039;t know that they&#039;re ever going be able to change that. But I think the men nowadays respect the women that they&#039;re fighting with more in most cases, even though there is a lot of sexual harassment. I think that they probably respect them more than they did when I was in. They just didn&#039;t want women in. I mean it was too fast for them. DUNHAM: There&#039;s a certain nature, because of the environment you&#039;re in, where sexuality is bound to come up in ways. But in terms of the harassment do you think there are things the military can do to be more proactive in addressing it and then also in dealing with it after the fact? TIDMORE: I think they&#039;re starting to deal with it now after the fact. I think now they&#039;re really beginning to do a pretty good job of it. But I really don&#039;t know what there is that they can do. I just don&#039;t know what would make it easier, or less prevalent. DUNHAM: To me, when you have the top-down of the general during World War II in Quantico who was so intolerant, that filters down. To me, if they had more sensitivity training, or whatever you want to call it, but really to be proactive and have zero tolerance for that time of abuse and harassment, I&#039;m not sure they&#039;ve come near to that.

WIKELUND: Okay, I did that for quite a while, several months, and then they needed a woman, a girl, and the guys all like me even though I was married, and I got a better job, and I became a liaison clerk then. I carried messages, I carried important, all kind of important, what do you call those--blueprints. REDMAN: Memos, or memorandum or-- WIKELUND: Yeah, I carried instructions and a whole bunch of stuff all around the plant. And you know, the guys would send me for funny things like sky hooks and all that. My boyfriend, man friend, not a boy, he&#039;s my age, Donald Baldwin, lives in America. He said, &quot;They sent you on these trips so they could watch you walk!&quot; I expect that&#039;s true because the thing of it is there was no sexual harassment law back there, and you really could get yourself into trouble, you had to be really careful. The guys like to feel you up, get you in a corner, and-- REDMAN: Yeah, tell me a little bit about, did your appearance change from the time, because you mentioned that you were wearing the riveting overalls and the scarf for when you were doing that, but then when you transitioned into this messaging job, did you change your outfit? WIKELUND: No, we had to be dressed that way. REDMAN: So you were still moving about the planes and the assembly lines with these instructions. WIKELUND: That&#039;s right. Then there were welders and all kinds of stuff like that, and you really had to be covered decently, none of the way the girls dress now. REDMAN: Right. So I am curious, that is really interesting when you told me that, so there was some, would you describe any of the relationships between the men and the women in the factory as having some hanky panky aspect to them, was there some of that as well? WIKELUND: Yes, there was a lot of that, but since I was newly married, I--but I have to tell you a lot of guys made passes at me and felt me up, and they just did, married men and older guys as well as young guys. And, of course, all the young guys tried to date me, and the married men felt me up, and not only me, but all the women. REDMAN: Now did that really bother people, or was it sort of, the women in particular, did that bother them, or did you get the feeling that that was something that was sort of laughed off at the time? WIKELUND: Well, it&#039;d depend on how graphic the feeling up got. You want to remember we women were just out of the home. The men weren&#039;t used to working around women then. They would pinch your bottom, then squeeze your breasts; they would get you in a corner and try to kiss you. I mean really they were ravenous beasts. REDMAN: Yeah.
