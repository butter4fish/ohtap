MP: Now you were the first women engineering student? MJM: Yes, but you know, that's why they were so kind to me I figured out. To have some man in the engineering department make sure [00:54:00] that no hanky panky or discomfort or whatever he thought might happen, but after being through the second world war, I mean, I was sort of psyched up and prepared, and I wasn't afraid, you know, because of all the things I had gone through. But I thought it was really considerate of the engineering department to worry about this young Pembroker, because I never had any Pembrokers and somebody who Ã¢Â€Â“ well they just never had any Pembrokers and I just didn't know how to handle it, so they assigned me Dr. Van Metre I think his name was. Nice Swiss, soft spoken man. And I always thought, you know, when the sexual harassment came out, I thought Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, Brown was really ahead of its time with that.Ã¢Â€Â First, allowing me, Pembroker, because they recently opened up all [00:55:00] their classes to Pembrokers and to allow me to go into engineering

Your students lead you the way. They are the ones, they saw some of the connections in race or disabilities, challenges, age and gender. Each one of those was sort of added as it grew into more of an issue for us. The gender and the race race came very closely after, but we were still calling it administrative strategies but I went back to Memphis and took, I don t know, about a three- or four-day workshop from Roosevelt Thomas. He had written the book Race and Gender that I had been using for the class, and it was an amazing time to spend with him, but I knew that I knew a lot more about race than I had thought I did. It 15 Nykolaiszyn Rhea Nykolaiszyn Rhea Nykolaiszyn Rhea confirmed that there were many, many connections there. And then ageism the different generations just integrated itself in, and that s how those things just happened. They just integrated themselves in. When we started out, sexual harassment was not an issue to begin with. It had always been an issue, but we hadn t talked about it, and then oh probably after the first session or two, we got into sexual harassment before it was out there in the mainstream. Were many colleges and universities integrating these types of courses? No, no, no, no, no. That s why I was asked to come and help put them together. I spoke at a lot of conferences and gave out all the information I had, sent them to places yeah no. I just had different support. I was so fortunate that I had somebody like Jay Boggs, and I had our dean, Robert Sandmeyer, and I had my department head early on, and my colleagues. I could not have done this without my colleagues.

 DECORY: He was ordained into the Catholic church. I just think to myself, &quot;How can you turn that religion off and on?&quot; I think then because of all the sexual harassment by priests, Catholic priests, I just think to myself, &quot;Did my priest do the same thing?&quot; I never saw any evidence of that. But you just wonder, did Father Kelly, over at Our Lady of Mercy--is it still there?

So I never have considered gender to be a handicap. In fact, I think that I got many, many, many opportunities. Many doors opened to me because the pool of women was small. It was easier for me because I wasn't a wife, I wasn't a mother, I didn't have to multitask. All of the things that make it very, very, very difficult for the youth today, I get it because I spend time mentoring them. I understand the problem of multitasking and trying to be all things for all people. [00:25:29] It was easier for me because I didn't have to do all those things. In a way, I could be very selfish. I didn't have to take care of anybody else but myself and then do what I wanted to do. What I wanted to do was succeed at Stanford. I didn't want to disappoint Henry Kaplan or Malcolm Bagshaw or Rich Hoppe or Dean Pizzo or whoever happened to be the person in leadership. So I never really saw gender as an issue. My friend Karen Fu, who was a trainee at the same time I was, reminded me of the day we came to Stanford. The room where the residents sat had lots of posters of Playboy pinups, posters of these braless calendar girls all over the walls. [00:26:26] I didn't remember, but Karen told me we walked into the residents' room said, "Take those down or we're going to put male nudes up on the wall." I said, "Karen, did we say that?" She said, "Yes we did, and they took them down." [laughter] So there probably was an environment of what today we'd call harassment or not a very nice way to act, but I don't remember it bothering me. [00:27:01] But my colleagues at Dartmouth, my friends, the girls in my class, talked about it all the time and still do, and they're asked to speak about it and write book chapters on it and speak to women's groups, etcetera. And they do. And I do, but I don't remember it being negative. Maybe I just don't put those things on my main menu. Maybe I just don't let them bother me. If they bothered me, I didn't put them in long-term memory. Gender has always been a card that's worked very, very well for me. I'm sure I've had opportunities I wouldn't have had otherwise because the pool of available women was very small.

JA: Uh, no. I think the kind of things that women are facing right now is not&#8212; well, there is outright discrimination and sexual harassment in a lot of areas. I personally never experienced any of that, but I understand there were women at IBM who did depending on what area they were in.

 JA: I think the ERA would have prohibited job discrimination. And no, I think that that&#8217;s the kind of thing that has to take place over time, but you need the legal structure behind you, and you need all kinds of legal structures that would be there automatically if there had been an Equal Rights Amendment. Now we have to fight it pretty much law by law. RP: Right. Restricted: Permission of interviewee required to quote from interview. Jan Allen 17 JA: You know, area by area. Sexual harassment probably would have come along as an issue as part of the ERA. I mean it did come along anyway, but there are lots of other things. There&#8217;s still unevenness in salary in the same kinds of jobs with the same kinds of wages and so on, and we&#8217;re still fighting this, and I think we will be for a long time.
