Well, we had some pretty strong cases, cases like the DiMarco-Bob White case. Most of the cases were rape cases where white people used to become dissatisfied and disgruntled about a thing. The best way they could do, some white woman would holler that she'd been raped by a Negro or ventured to rape, or something like that, and of course that meant a burned or lynched Negro. And so this happened down at Conroe. But we were able to get a lawyer - this was one of NAACP's first projects - and a lawyer that won that case in our favor. And the day of the trial when he was declared innocent and turned loose, they shot him right in the jail house, I mean right in the courthouse down in Conroe, that's in Montgomery County. Well, those things were so exciting to me, I did not know that people could be treated like people in Houston were being treated.

During the days I was with the NAACP, I almost could bet you money on that, if they arrested a Negro, they were going to take him out on the outskirts of town somewhere first and beat him up, and then bring him back and throw him in jail. And hardly anybody ever was put in jail that came out without being beaten. And they always said theyÃ¯Â»Â¿43 (cont) sometimes would have to tie their feet and hands and beat them down and all that to subdue them. But I never could understand how a man with his feet tied and his hands tied had to be knocked around They have stomped men in the jail that were accused of rape.

My first recollection of Rockingham, North Carolina, was after Mother's brothers and sisters were grown. They were all as dark as we were, but my mother was a more Indian type with long straight hair, very Indian type of a woman. I always wondered why Mama didn't favor her brothers and sisters. There were a lot of them, she had a lot of brothers and sisters. And so, one day, I asked Grandmother why Mama didn't favor Grandpa Patrick Covington and why she didn't favor her other brothers and sisters. I remember, Mama told us,"Hush, don't ask such questions." Grandmother said, "Yes, they do." Grandmother said, "Your mother's father is a white man. He was the son of my overseer in the family to whom I belonged." And she said that on the eve of or after the Emancipation, "Your mother was born in 1865." Grandmother said, "I was a house servant. I was never mistreated by the family. I was like a member of the family, but this young boy," she said, "he didn't rape me, but he took advantage of me and your mother was born to the slave master's son." And she said, "Later or., I married Patrick Covington and to Patrick Covington, all of these children were born." Then we always understood why Mother did not favor her brothers and sisters. And they loved her.

 Can tell you what I know. And I can tell you how others felt. Marian Anderson, my friend, was not a race person. There were some of us who always lived above race. If anything was ever done because of my color, I don't remember it. But I do know the facts and I'll give them to you. These are facts from friends whom I know. There were within the race different colors of people and, because I knew some things that came to me from somewhere, that didn't disturb me. If a person was very bright or he wasn't so big and fat, you saw those persons on stage and you saw them on programs, even little children. The ones that were fat and ugly and dark -by some people they were not called upon. But the little light ones and the little pretty ones were. Now that was within the race. And it was true of grown people. But I hasten to say what I found out. When I found it out, I don't know. As we were removed from slavery, you don't find as many bright colored people as you saw 70, 80 years ago. All mothers during slavery who had bright children were not raped. They knew that if their children had a white father and if those children were light, they would have better advantages in the world. Many of the white men during slavery educated their children. Many of the women who had children by those white men were house servants. They had charge of that man's house, all the cooking, all the cleaning. They even nursed the white woman's babies. The white women were ladies. They did nothing but sit in the front room and dress and sleep. It was not until white women rose up against that, and told their men they would not allow them to accept these black women any more, that that was stopped. Now those of us who remember that are not as mad as perhaps those who think that all black women were raped. They were not. There are many bright colored people who were as close to their white parents as we are to our black ones. I am going to tell you about one, something that I know. I'll name the place and the people who lived there would not object to it because they talked freely. When I taught at Snow Hill, Alabama, I had a friend, a young man, a friend in Dothan, Alabama, who was from Beatrice, Alabama. Beatrice, Alabama, is near Snow Hill. A friend in Snow Hill said she would take me to Longmire's home. Longmire was then in Washington studying to be a lawyer. She says, "I'll take you to Longmire's home. You can meet his people." She took us to Beatrice, Alabama. And we stayed in a home where there was a woman, a dark woman, and several bright men and women. We heard one fellow say, "I'm going to get up and go to the big house and look after my father." This was as late as ...I taught at Snow Hill in 1924. And I asked, I said, "Where did he say he's going?" They said, "His father is white and lives in that big house up there." And his mother had every convenience that she could have, but they never married.

Well anyway, there was struggles all the time, white men trying to molest us all the time, you had no peace from white men. I remember my brother, this was a brother, my father's son by a previous marriage, he went and got with the boss's son at the big sawmill, who had insulted me. That was an insult for a white man to say he wanted you, that was an insult, you see.

AM: I had about eight, you know, from the different marriages. And he married my mother... My father's father was a white man. His mother had been raped, you see, on the plantation, And so he was the son of a white man. CG: Now what was his name? AM: My father was St. Cyr Moore. Father was a very handsome man, about six feet tall, and broad shouldered, very powerful man, powerfully built, very good looking, extremely good looking. And I understood that he married my mother more out of spite than anything else. His second wife was one of those...they call them octoroons in New Orleans. That is, you couldn't tell her from white. Obviously the daughter of a lot of raping in that family. And my mother was your complexion, and this was supposed to have been a cardinal sin, for a man of his complexion to marry a brown woman. And so the prejudice was very high against color in the South. The light-skinned people felt that they were superior to the black-skinned people, and this was taught to us, it was taught. Everything that happened in your life was to demean the original people, the African complexion. And the ones who was mixed with the white blood was better. It's a terrible scourge; that was, again, an injury against us. They added insult to the injury; after raping us, then teaching us that we were better than the black ones that had escaped the rape, you see? So this always had somewhat an effect on me. When Marcus Garvey came on the scene, then of course a deep consciousness was awakened in me. And I recall the lynching; my grandfather was lynched. CG: Ah. Your father's father or your mother's father? AM: My mother's father was lynched. My grandmother's husband was lynched and... CG: Now was this the grandmother that you went to stay with?Ã¯Â»Â¿5 AM: Yes, that was Grandma, and you couldn't tell her from a white woman to save your life, which shows all the rape that went on in our family. You know, I mean with our people. CG: And he was lynched? AM: Yes. He was a black man, he was very black, and he was lynched for standing up to some white people who wanted his land. This was all it amounted to, because after he was lynched they ran my grandmother off the land, and she had to take her five little children and flee for her life with the things they had on their back, nothing else, leave everything, their cattle, they had cattle and everything on her farm. So all of her children, Grandma had to place them with white people.

I found our little girls in the crazy house, or the insane or whatever you want to call it, mental institutions, little twelve-year-old girls, ten and twelve years old, having babies for white attendants in the insane asylum and nobody paid that any attention. Nobody paid that anyÃ¯Â»Â¿33 AM: (cont.) attention, see? All the atrocious things, men who could tell you all kind of torture things that happened to them in jail. Women who could tell you how they'd come and round up their menfolk at a fishfry, put all the menfolks in the van while the cops go in there and rape the women, go back in the house and rape the women. All kind of things like that. So it's a terrible situation, a terrible situation. I don't see how we can tolerate that condition without rebelling, see.

EMS: No, I didn't hear any tales or witness tales of the lynching. I saw charred bodies up against trees in Vicksburg on Clay Street. They were burned beyond recognition, and they said the body was a body of Jesse Dawt's brother, a colored man that attempted rape on a white girl. TD: That was in the city... EMS: Vicksburg, Mississippi. TD: About how old were you then when you saw that?Ã¯Â»Â¿21 EMS: I was seven or eight years old. We dare not to talk about it, we dare not to say anything, it was just there, what the gasoline... TD: As a child, if you were seven years old, somebody must have told you. EMS: My father, my mother's husband told me, I think it was. TD: Told you that...he identified these charred bodies and the fact that... EMS: Well, the people were talking... TD: Attempted rape...a seven-year-old child does not necessarily know what attempted rape would be. EMS: No. Because I doubt it seriously if they used the word rape back in them days. TD: What word did they use? EMS: I think they used the word that they insulted a white girl. TD: I see. He insulted a white...insulting is a little different from rape. EMS: I know, but he asked the question and insulted her, and we knew what that meant, because we didn't know the word pregnancy, what that meant. They were just saying that the girl had broke her leg, and I was so dumb, I looked to see was her leg broke. But her leg wasn't broke, but her stomach was setting out and that is the way, the language they used to us children. And my mother was very, very close-mouthed and would not tell us anything, education that we could pick up from. I didn't know, I guess she taught us like she was taught. And when old people would talk, those old people are gone, people were talking about what one child done and the other one done and had or got pregnant by, some of the relatives of that family and so on... They kept their mouth shut because it seemed to me since I got grown, pretty well all those people on that plantation are that one family. So and so's family was very, very much mixed up, one man was the keeper of all his sisters and things like that and getting children by them and things like that and keeping them out.

MODJESKA SIMKINS: No, I can't. I've often wished that I could remember that, because my mother &#8230; well, in the first place, my father was a mulatto. After freedom, his mother worked as a nursemaid in a white home there in Columbia. And she became pregnant by the father of this family and my father was a result of that union. And he never, although he should have, he never fully forgave his mother for that. The result was that my mother, who was the daughter-in-law, naturally, of his mother, she understood her better and my grandmother was devoted to my mother. My father never was abusive to her, but yet, he was cold. He was a man that had very high principles, clean-cut, honest, and very high principles. And he just, although the girl being a teen-ager was evidently the victim of circumstances, he never quite got over it. And so, although we were born in the city, my father early decided to take us into the &#8230; to buy some land on the outskirts of the city, which has now just about come into the city and is very valuable, you know, as the city has moved out. Because, at that time, he said that there was nothing for a young girl to do if she had to help the family out, except work as a nursemaid for white families. And he said that he wasn't going to have his daughters working in one of those homes. You see, that stayed with him. And so, he bought this farm land outside of Columbia and he said that he wanted his children to learn how to work and to know the value of a dollar, but he was not going to have them working in a white home. I've never thought that he hated whites, but this particular thing stayed in his mind. But, now, I knew his father, which was my white grandfather and I remember him well. Even though he had his white wife and his children, some of whom are lawyers at home there now &#8230; they own us, but we don't own them.

And the men in the rural area in those days didn't think that a woman got through the week unless she got a whipping and so my mother anointed many of them in the back where they were whipped and all that type of thing. And then she was fearless when it came to any situation. My father kept very good guns all the time. Once the family was with him in Arkansas and they fired into the home down there because they didn't want to work under him as a black foreman, but he always had guns. Ever since I have known him, he had good guns. And so, when we moved to the country, the whites would just walk up to a house and insult a black woman or tell her to come go with them and the husband couldn't do anything about it and all that kind of thing. They didn't come up to our house, unless they were way down in the field and they would keep hailing and hailing until they knew that you heard them. Then they would come up to the house. But they didn't trust my mother or my father with those guns. I'm very different. I don't touch a gun. And one of my brothers doesn't bother with guns, but the other one, the physician, he keeps his guns. I had a friend that died and had a very nice gun, I gave it to him. Because I wasn't going to use it. JACQUELYN HALL: What did your father say about the guns? You knew what they were for? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Well, he hunted a good bit. He never had a pistol, but he had a Winchester rifle, I think what they called a Sixteen Shooter, I know that it had a lot of cartridges in it. Then, he had a shotgun, a very fine one. JACQUELYN HALL: Did he use them to protect your mother, to protect you all from being MODJESKA SIMKINS: No, that was never said. That's what it was for if necessary. Because the night that that mob came to the house in Arkansas, one of them eventually was shot. I was quite a little girl, but I remember it just as though it happened last night. And when that one was struck, the crowd dispersed immediately. You don't have to hit but one of the fellows in a mob.

JACQUELYN HALL: Well, how do you account for white women being more outspoken than white men? MODJESKA SIMKINS: I don't know, except that they realize, as the women in the old Interracial realized, that &#8230; you see, back there, when they first started that Interracial, it was not only against lynching, but fundamentally it was against the white men telling that lie all the time that they had to protect their women just as though the women didn't know when to say no and when to say yes. JACQUELYN HALL: And that came up in the meetings? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Yes, that was understood. That's one of the things, if you look back into the establishment of the old interracial movement here in Atlanta and some white women in other places &#8230; you see, white men always said that they were protecting white womanhood and they wanted to keep them pure. And they cloistered their women. Even in slavery, they would cloister their women, but they would go out and have babies by the slaves. And then, often these men in these prominent white families had their black paramours that their families knew about, because they didn't want to violate these young white women that were in those families. And even during slavery, some of the most beautiful black slaves, mulattos, were sold into the slave markets of New Orleans where they were bought to be mistresses of a number of sons of these masters. And of the masters themselves. And Thomas Jefferson had two or three daughters sold down there as slaves. JACQUELYN HALL: In the meetings of the Interracial Commission, did the white women talk about this situation? MODJESKA SIMKINS: No, it was known. They didn't talk about that. I don't remember that coming up, but I do know that when you look back into the history of it, that's what started it. They became incensed because the men were always talking about them just like they were helpless, you know, snivelings. And they knew that a lot of times, they were lying. And then, some of them felt that it was a reflection on their intelligence. And then, a number of them knew that their men were lying. Many times, when they did this and were going on like that, they realized that &#8230; although I never heard this said in a meeting, I've had it expressed to me otherwise, that a lot of this thing that men were talking about protecting them from black men was because they knew how they were violating black women and they just thought that the shoe would turn the other way. JACQUELYN HALL: Did you have that expressed to you in private conversations? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Just talking like we are now, or maybe two or three people together. And very often, as in the case that I told you about my grandfather, it was known by the whites around there that he was going with these black women. And at the same time, they wanted to kill a black man that went with a white woman. And although prior to, I think it was 1895, when Ben Tillman started &#8230; with Ben Tillman's regime in South Carolina, there was no Jim Crow on the trains. Blacks and whites went to dances together. I've had an old white woman tell me that she had been to dances many nights where Negroes were with whites. They would visit each other's homes out on the plantation like that during Reconstruction and after Reconstruction. And then, they brought in these Black Codes. They took back the government and then they put in all these laws and that created this particular thing that we have had to fight all these hundred years.

She was the one who went over with Dr. Lough to Bon Air and made contact with Virginia's reform school for girls, "State Industrial School for Girls." Florence was the one who followed up on that. Now, our experience there was to me a very interesting thing. It was the first concrete evidence that I had ever had, that if you believed in 34 people and gave them an opportunity, they would change, that they had it in them to change. Before that I had been thought of, at least around home, that I was too idealistic, that I was like Don Quixote fighting windmills, and so on. These girls at the Farm were taken off the streets in Norfolk and all over Virginia, but the Norfolk area was the one that I knew. They had been either five-and-ten-cent store girls or waitresses, and their pay was ridiculously low. And of course, especially as waitresses, they were exposed to sailors and everybody coming in who wanted to take advantage and have brief affairs. So a lot of these girls did. With some of them, it had happened in their own families. The uncle or their stepfather had raped these girls, and that had started them this way. Anyway, the situation was very terrible up there at the Virginia Reform School. They had a woman in charge who was unbelievable. She said that the girls were wicked; they should have no contact with each other, because all they could do was contaminate each other. So she didn't allow them to talk, at least not visit with each other. They had work brigades, kitchen, barnyard. This "reform school" is at Bon Air, Virginia. It is still there, as far as I know. This woman in charge, Mrs. Grimm, she was very oldfashioned and rigid in her religion. She had a pin on that said, "God is Love." We didn't know her; we only knew her successor. We heard all about Mrs. Grimm later from the girl inmates. She made these girls kneel down, wherever they were, at noon, and pray. She also was very superstitious. She told them that they were evil, that dancing and cards and everything was 35 wicked. If they ever danced, they would go to hell on the dance floor. This showed up later. These girls, most of them had very little education, and were also very superstitious. All kinds of women prisoners were there, the old so-called "hardened" women, and these young girls of fifteen the sixteen. The first thing that the new Director, Mrs. Peterson did. . . . She was called in from Connecticut, where she had done one of these first projects with a so-called reform school and been successful. So the Virginia state legislature called her in, because these girls did terrible things to each other. They threw lye; some of them would swallow lye, and some of them tried to commit suicide. They all ran away. So they had to round these 120 girls up. That was such a scandal. The state didn't know what to do. So they fired this woman, the one with the "God is Love" pin. She had taken the girls' clothes away from them. They had to wear sacks; they didn't have any individuality or anything of their own. The Virginia legislature called in Miss Peterson, and this is when we got into the picture. One Sunday Miss Lough in church sat next to this Miss Peterson, who was new in town. Of course, she was isolated completely, because Bon Air didn't like the school, and didn't want to have anything to do with anybody that was connected with it. But she and Miss Lough made friends over the hymn book. She said that what she wanted most for these girls was to have some normal human contact. The first thing that she had done was to separate the girls from the older "hardened" ones. She gave them back their clothes. The other woman had had their heads shaved. She let their hair grow. 36 She started a school, because until now there was no school. Miss Peterson set up a grade school, mostly. The girls still worked on the farm, or in the kitchen or so on, but she cut out a lot of this false type of religion, and the girls adored her. They just worshipped Miss Peterson. She also began to have trusties. She had the windows and doors unlocked in dormitories. When we went up to visit Miss Lough, one Friday afternoon, she had Miss Peterson there. There were only about five or six of us girls. Miss Peterson talked with us and said how much these girls needed just to be with other girls. So we thought that was a very nice idea. Florence Decker, Emily Gardner and I, and I don't remember the other girls, went over with Miss Lough to Bon Air to meet the girls. We found it very exciting, because first of all, each girl now had her own room. Locks and bars were off the doors and windows of their rooms. It was open, and they each had their own. It was almost like a cell, their tiny room, but they put their own things in it, and little pictures up, taken from magazines. Several of the girls were making things for Miss Peterson. I remember one girl was making a pillow. Another was crocheting something. She showed it to me and said that it was for Miss Peterson. You could see that they had a nice relationship. Soon after Miss Peterson first came to Bon Air, she decided that the girls should begin to live a more normal life. Since they danced outside, they should dance here. So one Saturday night, she had somebody play the piano. There was a trained nurse there. Miss Peterson danced with the trained nurse, to start it off. The 37 girls were all astir, because this other woman had said that if they ever danced, the floor would open up and the Devil would come. I guess they did actually believe it. Gradually, the girls moved closer. By now they had their own clothes, and their hair had grown. They came out on the floor, little by little. They began to dance. Then one of those awful electric storms came that Virginia has. It knocked the lights out. Miss Peterson stumbled over the girls, because they were all lying on the floor, screaming. As she stumbled over one of the girls, the girl yelled, "The Devil's got me! He's got me!" It's so pathetic, and yet so funny. So she went and got a penny for the fuse box, and they were able to get the lights back on. And from then on, of course, things got better. They really saw that these things they feared weren't true. By the time we went to Bon Air they were all quite relaxed. We played basketball together that afternoon. The next thing, later, somebody said, "Let's invite them over to our campus? We will have a basketball game with them." When the Dean heard of this and the church Elders heard of it, of course, that was the end. They said that it was scandalous. When the parents and preachers would hear, "Our innocent young girls, being associated with these women!" it would be terrible! This was our junior year in college, and Florence's last year. War had started. Florence went over that summer and worked as an intern in social work at the Farm, now called "Cherry Farm." She told me that still, when these girls would get desperate, they would swallow lye. The thing was that they didn't want to leave. Before, they ran away. Now, this 38 life with Miss Peterson was a new environment and everything going well. They didn't want to go. They begged to stay. Sometimes they would do something to be sent back. But Miss Peterson's contract was not renewed. She was only there a year. There was too much opposition and. . . . M.F.: A lack of su
port. Markeyi Yes. So it was not renewed. I never followed up on her, but I think that she must have been pretty well known in this period of the prison reform movement, so called. But that convinced us, you see, that these girls who were considered such outlaws, such pariahs of society, were girls mostly like us.

MODJESKA SIMKINS: I can't fully assess it. I could just say that I don't think the South would be the same without what they did, because they opened the eyes of a number of people. The thing that the political power structure had against the organizations of that kind was the fear that they would bring the black and white mass together. And the power structure has always feared the combining of the forces of black and white masses. I can remember the first meeting of the Southern Negro Youth Congress I went to in Knoxville where there were miners, people in brogan shoes, overalls, just like they wear jeans around here now. The average person didn't think of wearing them then unless they were going to the field or going to the mines. And those fellows came out there with brogans, and overalls, and sunhats, and all of them were working and planning together. Well, the first thing they did when they got a chance was to red smear and disrupt the movement. Now, I think if the Southern Negro Youth Congress, for instance, could have gone on, there would have been a very great change in the South because the younger people would have worked together better. But the power structure doesn't want that. They don't want poor whites and Negroes getting along together. There's always been the effort, either obvious or subtle, on the part of the reigning element to keep the forces of blacks and whites apart. But they built it on the sex angle. They always say, "They'll rape your women. They want to marry your daughter." But they weren't thinking about that. They didn't care any more about a poor white than they did about a Negro. And they still don't. They just give them a little more deference because he's white like they are, but they don't give a damn about a poor white. They'll exploit him just like they will a Negro. I've seen it. I know what I'm talking about. So that was their affair. Why do they have to worry about Negro men and their women? If they hadn't power enough to hold their women, if somebody could take their women from 'em,, why, they ought to take 'em. You see? Just like I hear people say sometimes if a woman can't hold her husband why would she want to get mad with somebody else for taking him? She ought to be able to hold him, treat him right, give him good food, take care of him. You never find, for instance, as I heard an old preacher say once, you'll never find a dog leaving home and going to stay at somebody else's house if you're treating that dog all right at your house. He's not going anywhere else. Well, when you find the dog trotting over there every time you turn around, somebody's throwing him a bone over there. He never gets a bone over here, just gets some dry bread and maybe a kick in the fanny, you know? [laughter] So, they use that sex thing. And they have used it as a social equality angle. They wanted to keep those forces apart, and they wanted to see that Negroes wouldn't take your job. When the unions come in, they try to tell whites if you get a union, the Negroes will take your jobs. They'll be making much as you make, or they'll bring your salary down to theirs, and all that kind of stuff. It's to divide the forces.

The children were loved and cared for, and they were helped to do things that they wanted to do. I saw no one scolding any children. I made a real point of that.

They were very different. But you know, on the other hand, I think the war had been over about two years when we were there, and by that time, the Japanese people had been able to do a great many things to bring them back to their normality. I found there was no food shortage, the children were well fed, but more than that, they were well treated as humans, with thinking powers of their own, and their parents and the other adults appreciated it and also encouraged it. I felt very good about that, and believed that we could learn a great deal from the Japanese people on child rearing. MT: No doubt... FPK: There was no child abuse at all! No child abuse at all!

It was his house, their house, you see, that was the teacherage. The other teachers just had rooms rented in the house. And they called him out and said a little girl, that was maybe going home from school that afternoon, went on a trail through the woods. And when she got home she told her father that a black man, or surely a black "boy", you know, a black "boy" had followed her on the trail. That is, he had walked behind her, some distance behind her. He might not have been following her. After all, he didn't molest her, didn't touch her, and didn't say anything to her. Well, the father got all upset. That's what happened. I found that out later. But this was the tale that was going the night before. So what happened was that the father alerted all the men in the community, so they got a big posse out in the woods, and they finally found the so-called follower, the "boy", who had followed this little girl. And they just took him out the next morning, out on the hillside by the woods, hanged him to a limb and shot him to death. I mean, it was just as simple as that.

DUNHAM: &quot;Teased us&quot; because you were young women? TIDMORE: Yes. We were young women. DUNHAM: So what was--? TIDMORE: Oh, things like I went to my tool box one day, and there was an artificial snake in it, which didn&#039;t make me very happy. DUNHAM: Did it ever get a little more serious? TIDMORE: No. There wasn&#039;t anything. DUNHAM: Sometimes we&#039;ve heard, in the shipyards and elsewhere, particularly on the night shift, sometimes we&#039;ve heard that things could get a little more &quot;hanky-panky&quot; or-- TIDMORE: Well, I guess I didn&#039;t attract any of them. [laughs] DUNHAM: I doubt that was it. TIDMORE: Well, I don&#039;t know, or else they were scared of me. Maybe that was it. But no. I didn&#039;t have any problem there or in the Marine Corps.

DUNHAM: Let me ask, first, you were with other women right there. What kinds of roles were the other women doing? TIDMORE: The barracks where we lived, they were all Motor Transport girls. Some of them were mechanics, and most of them were driving. DUNHAM: Did you commiserate about-- TIDMORE: Yes. We did. DUNHAM: Were there other stories of even worse experiences? TIDMORE: No, I don&#039;t recall any. DUNHAM: Nothing like around sexual--it wouldn&#039;t be called that at the time--but sexual harassment or that kind of thing? TIDMORE: I don&#039;t think so. I do remember, when I was driving staff car, I had to pick up two girls that were gay. I was so naÃƒÂ¯ve; I didn&#039;t have any idea what was going on. But they were being discharged. They found out they were gay, and they were being discharged. They were in the back of the station wagon, and I had to take them over to the captain&#039;s office. DUNHAM: How did you find out that they were gay? TIDMORE: Well, they told me. They told me that&#039;s what was happening to them, that they were gay and they were being discharged. And I don&#039;t have any idea who they were or anything. I was just shocked. DUNHAM: Had you known of any other gays or lesbians growing up? TIDMORE: No. I don&#039;t think I knew any of--I did think, now as I think back, that there probably were a number of them, you know. But in the group that I ran around with there weren&#039;t any. And none of my group ever got harassed, sexually harassed or anything. So, I don&#039;t know. DUNHAM: Did any of the women get pregnant while they were in--? TIDMORE: Yes, two. But they were married. Both of them had been married and not told anyone because if you were married you had to get out of the service. So they didn&#039;t tell anyone. And they got pregnant, and then they had to leave. DUNHAM: They were discharged. TIDMORE: Yes. But two of the girls in my section that I ran around with got pregnant and left. DUNHAM: Anything else about Quantico or Washington before you tell me about your transfer to-- TIDMORE: No. DUNHAM: You&#039;d been requesting a transfer, and finally it came through? TIDMORE: Finally it came through. How did I get from Quantico to San Diego? DUNHAM: Sure. TIDMORE: On a troop train. It was, I think, three days. I think I left shortly before Christmas. I did. I had two weeks leave, and I went home for Christmas. Then I got on another troop train and came out here to Los Angeles and then down to San Diego. DUNHAM: What&#039;s a troop train like, for someone who&#039;s never ridden one? TIDMORE: Just full of military, some Army, Navy, Marines. I think most of them, though, were Marines when I came from Quantico home to Iowa. I think that was mostly--and that wasn&#039;t real long. Did you ever hear about--every place that the train would go through in a small town, the people would come out when the train would come through and have cookies and sandwiches. And the train would slow down at these places and stop if there were a lot of people out with food. And we&#039;d all get out and get our sandwiches and take them back to the train. And that happened all the way from Cedar Rapids to San Diego too. I remember, I think we got the best food in Salt Lake City. DUNHAM: Do you remember what it was? TIDMORE: No. It was sandwiches, I remember. I was thinking how I really felt good about that. We were up all day and all night sitting in the chair. DUNHAM: You couldn&#039;t sleep. TIDMORE: No. No place to even wash up. There were lavatories on the train, but-- DUNHAM: It was predominantly men? TIDMORE: Predominantly men. But they were all good. They never--I don&#039;t know. Never, ever did I feel harassed in any way. Isn&#039;t that amazing? I guess I must have scared them. [laughs] DUNHAM: Well, it could be how you carried yourself, that they knew, maybe, not to mess with you. TIDMORE: Maybe, Never thought of it. Don&#039;t know.

DUNHAM: You mentioned when we were talking about discrimination against women back at Quantico that--you hinted that there are still struggles. What&#039;s your perspective on that today? TIDMORE: There&#039;s still a lot of discrimination against the girls. And it&#039;s too bad. They&#039;re really good. Now they have to be as good as the men. And in most cases, I think--the ones that I know are. And they don&#039;t always get a fair shake. The make it up to colonel, like in the Marine Corps. But that&#039;s just about as far as they get. There are some generals; there are a few but not a lot. I just think that they have a hard time.

I don&#039;t know that they&#039;re ever going be able to change that. But I think the men nowadays respect the women that they&#039;re fighting with more in most cases, even though there is a lot of sexual harassment. I think that they probably respect them more than they did when I was in. They just didn&#039;t want women in. I mean it was too fast for them. DUNHAM: There&#039;s a certain nature, because of the environment you&#039;re in, where sexuality is bound to come up in ways. But in terms of the harassment do you think there are things the military can do to be more proactive in addressing it and then also in dealing with it after the fact? TIDMORE: I think they&#039;re starting to deal with it now after the fact. I think now they&#039;re really beginning to do a pretty good job of it. But I really don&#039;t know what there is that they can do. I just don&#039;t know what would make it easier, or less prevalent. DUNHAM: To me, when you have the top-down of the general during World War II in Quantico who was so intolerant, that filters down. To me, if they had more sensitivity training, or whatever you want to call it, but really to be proactive and have zero tolerance for that time of abuse and harassment, I&#039;m not sure they&#039;ve come near to that. TIDMORE: No, they haven&#039;t. I think you&#039;re right. I think that would probably help a lot if they would start there. DUNHAM: But it&#039;s certainly a challenge anyway.

BARQUIST: He had run away with his niece. My family had a little incest, as you might know. This is a family of eleven children, and these three guys, these three old bachelors, and we used to go there all of the time. This one bachelor, George, was the youngest one, and he and the daughter of their older brother who lived down the road whose name was Judson, had a young daughter who was not very anxious to become a farm wife, and ran away with George. She and George ran away together. REDMAN: Okay. BARQUIST: This was a terrible shock to the family. REDMAN: Okay, okay. BARQUIST: And their names were not mentioned -- REDMAN: Okay, so they were disowned after the -- BARQUIST: But I liked them. I lived with them in Oceanside, and Evelyn and I went to the beach.

BARQUIST: I do not inquire into my fellow human beings&#039; sex lives. REDMAN: Right, yeah. BARQUIST: Regardless of what it is. REDMAN: Yeah, now let me ask about that because that&#039;s an interesting question because in many of these interviews where I talk to people about the Great Depression or the Second World War there&#039;s sort of this, sometimes people will have the notion of, there might have been this hush hush idea about what went on in the bedroom, but it was something that seems to have been gossiped about quite a bit in some of these unusual ways, so can you talk about how people in your family may have talked about what was going on with your uncle and his niece? They might have discussed it in some ways, but to you it was none of your business. BARQUIST: Well, their father, who has three other girls or four other girls, was furious, of course, and had he been capable I suppose he&#039;d have gone after his brother with a shotgun, but he didn&#039;t. That&#039;s one reason they went to California. REDMAN: To get away. BARQUIST: Yeah, they wanted to get clear away from both of their families because it was more of a clan than a family. REDMAN: I see. BARQUIST: Because there were, my great grandmother who had come from Pennsylvania with my great grandfather in a covered wagon, as I said, and the Conestoga wagon was still out under the trees when I was a child. REDMAN: Is that right? Okay. BARQUIST: They used to butcher their hogs on it, use it for a butchering platform. Yeah, they came and had thirteen, I think, certainly eleven living children.

FUREY: It was neat to dress up. It was neat to go over to the City and that&#039;s when they started making synthetic shoes. And you didn&#039;t have to have a coupon for those. So the first ones I bought were red sandals with platform soles. I thought they were just the greatest! Nylons were almost impossible to come by. Marian painted her legs and drew the line up the back so they looked like socks, but I don&#039;t remember doing that. The skirts were just about knee-length--pretty basic. I bought a dress that was to go to dances. The skirt part of it was black. The top was almost a Hawaiian print in black and red and white, and it had kind of a cowl neck and then big shoulder pads and short sleeves, but short sleeves were to the elbow. And of course, there were no zippers so it was the button placket on the side. But the skirt had black fringe over the underskirt and I still have that dress. And a few years back I wore it to kind of a rock--I had some friends who were rock musicians and so I went to one of their gigs and I wore that. And I never got pinched and poked so much in my life! [Laughs] With that fringe skirt! So that was fun. I also have a pair of slacks--and the style was kind of--surprisingly, I would say kind of German. The waistband was wide and kind of scalloped with an embroidered flower on it and I had jumpers that had the same thing. They had flowers embroidered on it, kind of like those lederhosen or whatever they are that the Swiss wear, you know? I don&#039;t know why that was in style, but it was.

They used to tell us to go to the ladies room for ten-fifteen minutes and that way, but I never experienced anything like that.

We don&#039;t necessarily call it harassment, from that period, but there were certainly stories of harassment or hazing or teasing and things of that nature. Did you experience any of that, or observe it? SAMSON: I never had that experience, and I don&#039;t think we really had a problem with that. Of course, I was only seventeen years old, so they treated me like their little sister or something a lot. But I never noticed anything with the other, the older; there were a lot of older women, wives, that their husband had gone on to the service and everything. I don&#039;t think the men there really resented us at all. There was a little difference, like [President] Obama&#039;s worried about now, in wages. It was harder for us maybe to advance than had it been a young man. But that wasn&#039;t the people we worked with&#039;s fault.

TORRES: My mother was a very quiet woman. Most of the talking was always done by my dad. My mother would caress us and love us and teach us prayers and all. My mother didnÃ¢Â€Â™t even know how to pay a bill. My dad did it all. See, he was the ruler and this was the way he felt the girls should be. Not me. I got a side job. I was working for JC Penney for twenty-five cents an hour and IÃ¢Â€Â™d been saving for my graduation. I felt I needed the ring, because in those days we got a ring. Our birthstone ring. That was one of the graduation -- and a yearbook. I was saving for it. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s why I had a little bit of money. I worked at JC Penney and I put all that money away. My folks kept asking me, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhat are you doing with your money?Ã¢Â€Â It was so little. I was always up in the attic. I had a hiding place nobody knew about and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s where I put my money. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s why I had the money when I read that article that California needed workers. I had to get as far away from my father as possible. That way he had no control over me. I loved him but I feared him. It was one of those things, that I respected him, I did what he told me to do, but I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to do a lot of the things. FARRELL: Before we get there I want to talk a little bit about your siblings. So you have three brothers and a younger sister. Can you tell me about your memories of them? TORRES: Oh, yes.

I wanted that new life. When I was on the bus all you do is think and you think, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, I had a home, I had everything. What am I going to come to?

He said, &quot;They sent you on these trips so they could watch you walk!&quot; I expect that&#039;s true because the thing of it is there was no sexual harassment law back there, and you really could get yourself into trouble, you had to be really careful. The guys like to feel you up, get you in a corner, and-- REDMAN: Yeah, tell me a little bit about, did your appearance change from the time, because you mentioned that you were wearing the riveting overalls and the scarf for when you were doing that, but then when you transitioned into this messaging job, did you change your outfit? WIKELUND: No, we had to be dressed that way. REDMAN: So you were still moving about the planes and the assembly lines with these instructions. WIKELUND: That&#039;s right. Then there were welders and all kinds of stuff like that, and you really had to be covered decently, none of the way the girls dress now. REDMAN: Right. So I am curious, that is really interesting when you told me that, so there was some, would you describe any of the relationships between the men and the women in the factory as having some hanky panky aspect to them, was there some of that as well? WIKELUND: Yes, there was a lot of that, but since I was newly married, I--but I have to tell you a lot of guys made passes at me and felt me up, and they just did, married men and older guys as well as young guys. And, of course, all the young guys tried to date me, and the married men felt me up, and not only me, but all the women. REDMAN: Now did that really bother people, or was it sort of, the women in particular, did that bother them, or did you get the feeling that that was something that was sort of laughed off at the time? WIKELUND: Well, it&#039;d depend on how graphic the feeling up got. You want to remember we women were just out of the home. The men weren&#039;t used to working around women then. They would pinch your bottom, then squeeze your breasts; they would get you in a corner and try to kiss you. I mean really they were ravenous beasts. REDMAN: Yeah.

So we found ourselves not in the swing of it for communicating well with Stanford students. But we also came in 1968. We had never really been in positions of responsibility in the way that we were in our previous experience. We were 31 now responsible in a world in which there were really drugs as well as alcohol, but maybe drugs [were] a more serious problem, including LSD. It was the big time of LSD and lots of experimenting in drugs. And it was also part of the period of sexual experimentation for young people, but both of us were very Victorian Catholic people. I keep saying this and telling you this. We had no personal background that would make it easy for us to even figure out how to operate. We did have assistant R.A.'s, who we needed and were very helpful, but they, too, were graduate students and were really not into the undergraduate scene. We communicated with them well, and they would mostly say to us, "Leave it to us. It's better that we try to deal with this LSD overdose that's happening in the dorm. You have to know about it, but it won't help for you to come in. Let us talk to them." [00:52:09] So we were constantly aware through our R.A.'s, but we were also horrified and distressed, but I don't think that we knew exactly what to do. I don't think anybody did. The person who was the person we sort of spoke to was a young man just here from Yale himself, who didn't have much experience. He was in what would be the Dean of Students Office. He was a very nice person, but he was, if anything, younger than we were. He was our liaison, too, and he was telling us what to do. He was really feeling his way. All of this was happening, and we weren't¦. Of course, it was happening in the nation. I mean, we had all lived through the assassination of Kennedy, the assassination of Robert Kennedy, and the assassination of 32 Martin Luther King. All this had happened in the years before, and we were still trying to take that in. [00:53:18] At one point when there was a rape in the dorm, a young woman had just gotten raped, Al came in the morning to tell me about that. I said, "Al, I don't understand. I don't believe it. Truly, this isn't possible. He said, "Barbara, the fabric of society is coming apart." He was right, it was very bad, and we didn't have the training or the experience to deal with it properly.

. Now one concern is the fact that, like anything where you had a lot of men and women, at West Point people never lock their rooms and occasionally men invade women&#8217;s rooms when they don&#8217;t want them there, maybe not for rape for just for the wrong sort of reasons. Just this past year I think it was, I saw in the paper that they had let women start locking their doors. In fact I guess everybody started locking their doors. But this guy that was so awful, I went over with a male civilian professor who was also on this committee and told the commandant&#8212;there&#8217;s an academic dean and then there&#8217;s a commandment in charge of the military&#8212;that I thought the summer program was bad and explained how I thought it affected the culture and he had a woman sergeant sitting in on the meeting and she agreed.

 Okay, we were talking about when I moved to Forsyth County and discovered that this was a county with no African Americans, no blacks, in the whole county and that some ten or fifteen years before had had this real race riot kind of--not a race riot. They had accused this black of raping a woman, or something, one of those episodes, and they ran every black out of the county, took over their farms and whatever and they had to move. I was told stories about how they hung blacks around the courthouse. I know they at least lynched the guy that they were accusing of this, and I don&#8217;t know how many others. Some people maybe have done some research on it, but the stories were told. I could just see bodies hanging all around the courthouse in my mind as to what happened. So it was kind of a really [pause] horror. And then blacks coming in through the town on trucks to deliver stuff to the stores were afraid to get out of the truck. They would hide in the back of the truck. I found this to be just horrifying, but somehow I never quite got it connected with doing anything about it or thinking about it in that way. My father came home from the mail route one day, and he said he saw this old black man bicycling through town and he was on his way to Gainesville. And he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m worried he&#8217;s got to go through Chestatee because that&#8217;s where the--.&#8221; The young Chestatee boys were the ones that started the riot. They threw all the blacks out, the rowdy boys of Chestatee. He said, &#8220;He&#8217;ll never make it to Gainesville,&#8221; so he gets in his car and he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go find him.&#8221; So he goes and picks him up and takes him to Gainesville and comes back, so there was that little bit of episode. Then this teacher comes to town--and I was telling that story when the storm hit--who had this black woman who was a companion, maid, person who&#8217;d always been in their family. And she taught music and the woman lived with her, and the boys from Chestatee came with torches and surrounded her house and made her get up in the middle of the night and take the black woman back to Alabama.

MORROW: Medicaid, being federally funded, had to comply with any federal rules. And my recollection is that the federal funding for the abortion issue was in cases of rape or threatened life of the mother. One of my concerns here in North Carolina was not only rape and risk of life of the mother, but incest. I felt that as long as it was legally right for the wealthy women to have abortions, that it should be legally right for poor women to have abortions. Poor women who could afford another mouth to feed even less than the rich, and so I persuaded the legislature to appropriate some state funds for abortions so that--. For example, thirteen, fourteen-year-old girls who got pregnant, and sometimes it was incest in the family, and they had no business first of all in getting pregnant, but they didn&#8217;t have control over it because its usually the male in the family who has control there. And secondly, they should not be forced to have a baby at that young age. So I thought we needed to have some state funds to abort these youngsters. And so the legislature, even though many of them were very opposed to abortion, they still felt that, you know--. They felt, I think, the same as I did, that to force a teenager to have a pregnancy and carry it through and have a baby that she was not able to take care of was not an appropriate thing to have happen. So our legislature, as I recall, appropriated two-hundred-thousand dollars in state funds for abortions for poor women, which would cover, of course, incest, rape, and risk of life of the mother, just as the federal government did, but it might cover some other situations where the pregnancy existed and was not needed nor wanted. It&#8217;s a shame that we can&#8217;t prevent unwanted pregnancies altogether, but the sex drive apparently is such a strong one for procreation that it alters behavior, especially if alcohol or any other kinds of drugs are involved. So I think it&#8217;s much more desirable to prevent unwanted pregnancies than it is to have to deal with them after pregnancy has occurred. DONNALLY: How did you go about convincing or proposing--? Was it just kind of a backroom consensus that the legislators didn&#8217;t think that teenage girls should be having to carry [a pregnancy to term](0:48:29)? MORROW: No, it was--. I&#8217;m sure I discussed this with people in the appropriations committee and explained my views of what I was dealing with and what I was seeing because in the health department itself, I had dealt with girls who&#8217;d come in and they were pregnant. Maybe they had arranged through some private enterprise to have an abortion, and then they&#8217;d come back in wanting to get contraceptives and I&#8217;d explain they&#8217;ll have to go and get their mother&#8217;s or father&#8217;s--. They have to have parental consent to even have contraceptives. So I think these were things that I discussed with the legislature, that so often we put so many barriers up because as the girls would tell me, &#8220;You know, my parents don&#8217;t give a damn.&#8221; And that always disturbed me that the parents could not care enough about their children to make sure that they were preventing an unwanted pregnancy. And here the girls were trying to look after themselves and I&#8217;d have to get parental consent for them to have contraceptives. That just didn&#8217;t make sense to me. So we discussed a number of legislative issues. I do know that as time went on, the two hundred thousand dollars, I know was reduced at least fifty thousand dollars because there were objections to abortions being made available through state funds. And I think ultimately the fifty thousand was omitted from the budget, but the legislators at that time were very willing to listen and they were open-minded on so many things rather than just having already pre-decided what they felt. [Brief interruption due to phone call.] DONNALLY: We were talking about attempts to provide contraception and contraception to teenagers. MORROW: [Unintelligible due to lack of microphone] DONNALLY: Oh, would you put your microphone back on? MORROW: The family planning programs in our local health departments, our county health departments do an excellent job of providing means for people who do not want a pregnancy to avoid those pregnancies. I think that in itself has lowered both maternal mortality and infant mortality by providing contraceptives to those people who are not able to or disabled or are not in a financial position to afford pregnancy.

Ada has not really kept up with restoring and keeping their historical things, so we re working on that. What else do I do? I have two wonderful grandsons. My youngest daughter, Amy, and Russ are back here in Ada now. Russ is in investments and Amy teaches fourth grade. Both girls said they would never teach ever. Their mother and dad were both teachers, and they would never, ever teach school.

Jesse is almost a junior at East Central and is very active in student activities, student affairs. Either one of my grandsons could either be a politician or a preacher, just take your choice, because they both like to perform. And the youngest one is a junior in high school and plays football plays left tackle on Ada High s football team.

He may be the politician of the family the next one. He may very well be. Yes, as I say preacher or politician, just take your choice. But they re fun and they live close by and I see them often and they help with things. I lost my husband three years ago, and I still am very active and do all kinds of things and 25 Finchum Floyd Finchum Floyd Finchum Thoughts of running again? Oh, well, in fact they called the other day. Just as you mentioned that they called the other day and they are looking for someone. I was very fortunate when I was in the Senate. Lonnie Abbott was the House member that shared this district, and Lonnie had been there since I mean, he had a great deal of seniority in the House. You asked about things that were surprising. When I was there a freshman, I remember one night Representative Lonnie Abbott walking across the rotunda and saying to me, Well, I ve just put 200,000 in a bill for the Vo-tech school there in Ada. You d better take care of it in the Senate. And I said, What? I said, What? He said, Take care of it in the Senate. You can do it. And I m thinking, How do I take care of 200,000 in the Senate in the budget in appropriations? You know, I mean What do I do? So I got through it. We had the Vo-tech school here in Ada and those are things that you learn. But again, the political scene has changed. He could do that because he had been there so long and the democrats were so in charge of the House of Representatives. He could do that, and you couldn t do that today. So they called me about back to my story, they called me two or three weeks ago from the House of Representatives looking for someone to run against the republican that s in the House now. They said, Can t you find someone to do this? Well, and I said, I m not young enough. I don t want to it costs so much money. That s the other thing that would take all the fun out of it. If somebody would just say, Here s 100,000. Go run. I d say, Okay. Get your mints and go. Oh, you bet you bet. I could do it. And I mean, Pontotoc County would be a piece of cake to campaign. I mean, I did six counties. Ignorance was bliss though the first time around. I had no idea how hard it was going to be and what I was going to have to do. I had no idea. Now I would know what you d need to do and, of course, it s changed so because you have to use the media so much. And we don t have a lot of media around here. It s mail-outs, hand-outs we only have a couple of local television, 12 and 10 are the only television stations. Then you ve got your radio stations, and then you ve got newspapers. Not everybody takes the newspaper so it s a different kind of campaigning. But I still say one-on-one, My name is Billie Floyd and your vote means a mint to me and I sure would like for you to vote for me. And there are people that want to be asked to vote for you. Well, you might reconsider and do it anyway one time. (Laughter) No? Not going to go there? All right. Well, can you see positive and negative 26 Floyd aspects to having served? Oh, the positive is wonderful. I grew. I learned. Okay. Now this is just like do you remember when Clarence Thomas was being confirmed? Right now, of course, that s going on right now because his book has just been released. Clarence Thomas was confirmed. Okay, the judiciary committee had to confirm his appointment by the President to the Supreme Court, okay. Remember the blood bath that took place? Do you remember that? Okay. We watched it. I told the people that knew me, having been just at the state level the President of the United States told the judiciary committee, he told them, he said, I want him Thomas confirmed. I don t care what happens. I don t want to be involved in it, but you get the job done. I don t care whose head rolls. I want him on the Supreme Court, and do not involve me. They were mostly republicans. It was a republican president. They did it. I saw that at a lesser level at the state level when the governor would say, I want that done. I don t want to be involved in it. I don t want my name with it. It s your committee. You re appointed to that committee. That s your job. I want it done. And that s where your party politics and, I mean, there would be no way that I can prove that that story is true, but scouts honor I ll bet you a nickel it is. I mean, and it s just like we were talking about Anita Hill, and I really admired Anita Hill. I really did, and I still do because I think the lady was probably telling the truth, and she got brought in. She didn t want to be brought in, but they brought her in. I mean, she was brought into that and not by the ones that were trying to get the confirmation done. It was by the other side that said, You ve got to come in on this. And I said, If she were going to make up a story, she s a smart lady. She would have certainly made a better story than a pubic hair on a coke can up as her story. I mean she would have made a better story up if she were going to go in there and lie about something. I think the poor gal was telling the truth. I saw her on television the other day. They interviewed her. Did you see her on one of the morning shows? She was absolutely she said, I m not going there. She said, What I did has opened the workplace up to women today to be able to not be discriminated or talked to or that sort of thing. She said, That was a step in our growth and our development. That was a necessary thing apparently to happen. And she said, I m not going there. I m not talking about his book. I stand on my testimony and that s all I ll say about that. But she said, My actions have made a difference in the workplace for women today. And she said, If that s what came from it, then that is worth it. And I mean, I was just awed because I thought, Oh, gosh. She is a class act. And she really so that was one of the things.

I think it was something that really proved useful in college because while we lived in a kind of protective setting as a function of dormitory life, Pembroke and Brown in the '50s were located in an area that was really quite unsafe in many ways.

MP: Now you were the first women engineering student? MJM: Yes, but you know, that's why they were so kind to me I figured out. To have some man in the engineering department make sure [00:54:00] that no hanky panky or discomfort or whatever he thought might happen, but after being through the second world war, I mean, I was sort of psyched up and prepared, and I wasn't afraid, you know, because of all the things I had gone through. But I thought it was really considerate of the engineering department to worry about this young Pembroker, because I never had any Pembrokers and somebody who Ã¢Â€Â“ well they just never had any Pembrokers and I just didn't know how to handle it, so they assigned me Dr. Van Metre I think his name was. Nice Swiss, soft spoken man.

Your students lead you the way. They are the ones, they saw some of the connections in race or disabilities, challenges, age and gender. Each one of those was sort of added as it grew into more of an issue for us. The gender and the race race came very closely after, but we were still calling it administrative strategies but I went back to Memphis and took, I don t know, about a three- or four-day workshop from Roosevelt Thomas. He had written the book Race and Gender that I had been using for the class, and it was an amazing time to spend with him, but I knew that I knew a lot more about race than I had thought I did. It 15 Nykolaiszyn Rhea Nykolaiszyn Rhea Nykolaiszyn Rhea confirmed that there were many, many connections there. And then ageism the different generations just integrated itself in, and that s how those things just happened. They just integrated themselves in. When we started out, sexual harassment was not an issue to begin with. It had always been an issue, but we hadn t talked about it, and then oh probably after the first session or two, we got into sexual harassment before it was out there in the mainstream. Were many colleges and universities integrating these types of courses? No, no, no, no, no. That s why I was asked to come and help put them together. I spoke at a lot of conferences and gave out all the information I had, sent them to places yeah no. I just had different support. I was so fortunate that I had somebody like Jay Boggs, and I had our dean, Robert Sandmeyer, and I had my department head early on, and my colleagues. I could not have done this without my colleagues.

So, between '88 [1988] and '92 [1992], you worked under Clarence Thomas? Speaker 2: Clarence. Speaker 1: Okay. Is there anything to say before we get to him? Speaker 2: Oh yeah, '88 [1988] and '91 [1991], 'cause I retired in '91 [1991]. Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Okay. Is there any--anything of note before we get to him? Speaker 2: Unh-uh (simultaneous). Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean-- Speaker 2: About? Speaker 1: About the civil rights--I mean, about the EEOC and activities of EEOC? Story_ID: 487504 Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you this, how did--what was it like under Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] and then how did it change under Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan]? Speaker 2: Under Carter, we were doing systemic investigations, which was either good or bad. But if somebody came in, you know, you take the whole class. But then under, I can't even think of his name. Speaker 1: Reagan? Speaker 2: Clarence [Clarence Thomas]. Oh okay, under Reagan they wanted to make it more difficult for black folks. So we had to do the one-on-one. You know, somebody comes in and filed a charge, sexual harassment, you just take her charge. Before we used to go in and investigate the whole, though everything and it might've been too much sometimes. But it was a one-on-one. Well you know if it's a one-on-one and you getting ten thousand charges, you never get through, there's no way. Because they don't give you the people, you know, to do the investigation. So just tremendous backlog. Speaker 1: So it's a bottleneck under--starting with Reagan where it became a bottleneck? Speaker 2: Oh yeah, uh-huh. Speaker 1: So, okay. Were any--okay give me an examp- now under Carter, for instance, what would be a successful investigation for the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] where someone's rights were vindicated as opposed to under the Reagan administration? Speaker 2: If you had--sometimes we would have an individual, particularly in the South, an older black man who had worked for a company right--let me see, thirty-nine years or twenty-nine, whenever you retire. One year before he would retire, the company officials would go back thirty years and say, you wrecked the truck thirty years ago, we found a beer bottle in the truck, that's it, they get no retirement. I mean just no retirement, no nothing. So, under the old administration you could go in and do a class action because they didn't just do it to that black man, they'd been doing it to black men forever, you know. So you just solved it all right there. You go back and get everybody and try to make them whole if you could. But under the next administration, that just didn't work because you have to deal with that one black man, that's it. You couldn't bring anybody else, you know, which was not good for black people. Speaker 1: So no class action lawsuits? Speaker 2: Unh-uh, I mean it was so limited. Speaker 1: Okay, so that basically nullified a view that--that racism exists in some ways, I mean it just nullified the whole idea that their system--systemic racism and saw everything as an individual incident. Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: Like this man named Henry Jones, regardless of whatever his race was or whatever is going on around him, he's--he had a, you know, he's got a problem and they--then they spend a lot of time fooling with his specific case without looking at the rest of them that are similar? Speaker 2: That's true. Speaker 1: And then it bottlenecks the whole system, that's what you're saying? Speaker 2: Right, right. And some, some companies in the South historically never let a black man draw a retirement check. So that should've been a class action. You know, what could he live on? A hundred and ten dollar social security check. That means he has to go out and get a job, which is unfair. Story_ID: 487505 Speaker 1: Who was in charge of the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] when Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was president, I mean I'm just, just for, you know, reference? Or do you remember, if you don't it's okay, we'll just move on? Speaker 2: I think it was Chairman Brown, Bill--William Brown [sic. Eleanor Holmes Norton]. I think he may be with, not FedEx [Federal Express; FedEx], UPS [United Parcel Service] now, attorney up there. I know he was there when I was there. Speaker 1: Okay, and then under Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], did he--now was that a job where you--the new administration can just hire who they want or--? Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: Okay, so-- Speaker 2: They put who they want in. Speaker 1: Okay, so, so under Reagan I'm sure somebody else was hired. And who, who was the person under Reagan before? Speaker 2: I'd have to think before Brown. Speaker 1: It might've been Clarence Thomas, I just don't know if it was Clarence Thomas yet or (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it wouldn't have been Clarence. Clarence was later. Speaker 1: Yeah, I thi- I thought he was a Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] appointee actually? Speaker 2: I can't remember, I'll have to go back, I have to think. Speaker 1: Okay, so-- Speaker 2: And, yeah. Speaker 1: All right. So, well let's talk about--well tell us about Clarence Thomas' regime as the--or his stint, as he was the--what do you call, the chairman of the EEOC? Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Well, you know he is conservative, but I, I have nothing negative to say about him since he saved my life, my career. I always ran one of the best offices in the country. I always got a 5.0 rating, and the highest you can go is 5.0. There was a white director who was my boss in district office who decided when he got the job in Memphis [Tennessee] that he had a Puerto Rican friend that he wanted to have my job. So, the first year I got a 4.0. The next year I had a 3.0, and now I'm still doing the same type of work. And so, one of my supervisors, a brother, said that's a pattern, you're gonna get a 2.0 and you're gonna be out the door. So you better start fighting. In the meantime, he started doing all kinds of things to me, having me investigated and just all kinds of crazy stuff. Trying to remove me. You know, with all the years' service I had and so. You know, I just started fighting him and it went to Clarence Thomas and Clarence Thomas sent it to an outside person in Virginia to investigate. And of course it came back just terrible on his part. And Clarence saved me. He agreed with the outside investigator. He didn't have to do that. They can say anything they want. I disagree, she's out the door, you know. So, but I have not heard that he was a bad chairman. Because once you're in the field you don't have the same connections in Washington [D.C.]. I don't know of too many people that he had removed. I just haven't heard anything negative other than that scandal. Speaker 1: Did, did you know (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I knew Anita too. Speaker 1: Okay, I was gonna ask you if you knew Anita Hill as well. Speaker 2: I mean, I believe everything she said. Now I'm not gonna say that, because I just believe in my heart she was a good person. And I guess just young, innocent and vulnerable. And I think she told the truth. But I think in a--in a--when he went from EEOC, I think, to a D.C. court and nothing ever came up, they didn't care. But then to become the [U.S.] Supreme Court person, that's when they cared, you know, 'cause there's too many other good black men out there that have nice clean background, you know. But he--I've been in Mexico at a conference and you'd always see him after midnight, you know how you stay up and party. Come on down there with the white women, dancing and carrying on, you know. He didn't have anything to do with us, you know. But he was respectful. He would speak and all of that, you know. But, other than that, you know. And he--I, I just didn't like him always talking about his, how poor he was and his sister was on welfare, and that was just demeaning to me, you know. Need to uplift her, you know. That was demeaning that he arrived and nobody else could make it out of the family. I think that was terrible. Speaker 1: So that's kind of contradictory to say your sister's on welfare and then not try to help her get off of it, if you're making that kind of-- Speaker 2: Yeah. My sister would've had a job if I were up there, you know, as a clerk-typist (laughter). So, but I, you know, other than that, I, I wasn't, I just wasn't close to him.

Did she have a chance to--you said she was, she had a proclivity for speech, but she wasn't able to really--she was shy about it. Did she go to school in--? Speaker 2: She went to the sixth grade. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: She went to the sixth grade, and I guess at that time she was thirteen or fourteen. And when she was that age, she was raped by the owner of the farm in Hartsville [South Carolina] on which my grandparents [Annie Young O'Neal and Seneca O'Neal] lived. And there was a child born of that, of that, union, my brother [James O'Neal]; very, very, fair, of course. And when my mother married my father, who was very dark, he did not want my brother to live in the house. And so my brother lived with
my grandmother until my father left us, and my mother then took him in. He was two years younger--I'm sorry, two years older than I. And later, my mother of course married my father, whose name was Junius Reed. And I was the result of their union, as was my brother, whose name is Junius Reed. He's still living, my brother is. My father passed in my brother's home. I never cared for my father, because when I was eleven he left home. He had been cut, he was stabbed, oh, maybe four or five years later. And--

Those are the things, the kinds of speeches that my mother taught me. And she could have been such an educator. Because she was, with just that sixth grade education. But life interfered with her, with her judgment, with her progress, with her ability to recognize what she was capable of. And I sometimes, I sometimes get emotional about that. But she was a wonderful, a wonderful woman. Story_ID: 645527 Speaker 1: Now when--you said earlier that when she was a teenager, she was raped and-- Speaker 2: Um-hm. Speaker 1: --was that an unusual situation in South Carolina in those days? Or was that something that, you know, happened pretty much? Speaker 2: I think it was--I think it was, it was very common. I think it was unusual for the person to have the child, which my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] did. But you didn't hear too much of--you didn't see the results of a woman having been raped by a white person. You didn't see that many fair-skinned people that didn't have fair--other fair-skinned people in their families. And so while I think rape was common during my mother's day, I think many people aborted or did not have a child. But my mother did, and he was such a wonderful person. He was, he was so good that when he was living in the country, as he did with my grandmother [Annie Young O'Neal] until he was in the eighth grade--and that's as far as the country schools went. Then, by then my father [Junius Reed] had left, my father. My biological father had left. And so I said to Mama, "Why can't we have Jay [James O'Neal] to come" because I loved him dearly. And she did. He came and lived with us and finished high school in, at Butler High School [Hartsville, South Carolina], the same place that I finished. But people, people ridiculed him, and he was so soft that he, he would just say, "Let it go, Lucy Mae [HistoryMaker Lucy R. Wilson]. Let it go. Just let it go. Don't worry about that." Speaker 1: So he must have really looked like he was white, I guess (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, he did. Oh, absolutely. Speaker 1: Because your mother was already fair-skinned. And-- Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes. He looked--you could not tell that he was not. Speaker 1: In fact, biologically, he probably was white. Speaker 2: He was. He was. He had certainly more than one eighth, and, certainly more than one eighth, you know, to be black. They say if you're one eighth, you're black (simultaneous). Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's all really kind of--I say biological. But it's all kind of crazy in a lot of ways.

So I never have considered gender to be a handicap. In fact, I think that I got many, many, many opportunities. Many doors opened to me because the pool of women was small. It was easier for me because I wasn't a wife, I wasn't a mother, I didn't have to multitask. All of the things that make it very, very, very difficult for the youth today, I get it because I spend time mentoring them. I understand the problem of multitasking and trying to be all things for all people. [00:25:29] It was easier for me because I didn't have to do all those things. In a way, I could be very selfish.

I didn't want to disappoint Henry Kaplan or Malcolm Bagshaw or Rich Hoppe or Dean Pizzo or whoever happened to be the person in leadership. So I never really saw gender as an issue. My friend Karen Fu, who was a trainee at the same time I was, reminded me of the day we came to Stanford. The room where the residents sat had lots of posters of Playboy pinups, posters of these braless calendar girls all over the walls. [00:26:26] I didn't remember, but Karen told me we walked into the residents' room said, "Take those down or we're going to put male nudes up on the wall." I said, "Karen, did we say that?" She said, "Yes we did, and they took them down." [laughter] So there probably was an environment of what today we'd call harassment or not a very nice way to act, but I don't remember it bothering me. [00:27:01] But my colleagues at Dartmouth, my friends, the girls in my class, talked about it all the time and still do, and they're asked to speak about it and write book chapters on it and speak to women's groups, etcetera. And they do. And I do, but I don't remember it being negative. Maybe I just don't put those things on my main menu. Maybe I just don't let them bother me. If they bothered me, I didn't put them in long-term memory. Gender has always been a card that's worked very, very well for me. I'm sure I've had opportunities I wouldn't have had otherwise because the pool of available women was very small.

My oldest sister, Mathilda, she got married and I was at the dance. I think that s how we met, in a caf , didn t we? Yes. And he knew my younger sister And your older sister, she went to school with me. Yes, but he asked my younger sister well I don t know what he asked her. I just asked her where you lived. So I went over to Marliese s house and talked to her. That s how we got acquainted. Then we started dating and he asked me if I wanted to come to the United States with him and if you love him and he loves you, you agree to everything. (Laughs) So yeah, we got
married very young I was nineteen and Heinz was twenty-four. Two years later was had a son. He was six months old when we came over here. We have another son; he was born here in Stillwater. And they both have degrees from OSU . Mike has an entomology degree. His name is Michael and the other son is Mark Stephan Hall. He works for the sheriff. He has a degree in sociology. And Mike is a professor at LSU in Shreveport. They have a pecan research station. Those are the nuts which we stole We have so many stories to tell. Toward the end of the war, our families had very little food in Germany. We had to trade tablecloths and goods, things for my mother, for potatoes and things like that. We went on farms just so we could eat. I have a lot of things to tell but I usually like to keep things inside and not talk about it. You kind of don t want to think about those things anymore. He has a funny story to tell. Which one? The one about the egg in France. When you stole an egg, remember? No, not eggs, they were peaches We went into an orchard; there were fifty German airmen in an orchard. This French guy came along with a pitchfork and he chased fifty soldiers out of a peach orchard We were all kids, seventeen, eighteen years old. 16 M. Hall Wilson H. Hall Wilson H. Hall Wilson H. Hall Wilson H. Hall Wilson M. Hall Yes, I could tell you about when we got occupied by the French in the afternoon. We were hiding in the forest because the planes were coming over. They said, The French are going to be here so we ran home and then we went into the cellar. My mother screamed at us to come down in the cellar and we three girls, we just were too curious. We went out in a hole and we peaked out and I could see the first tanks coming down the street. Then my mother screamed again that we had to go down in the cellar and everybody got locked up. My mother locked my older sister up in the attic because they were saying people got raped and all kinds of stuff. So I could tell stories, which takes I don t know how long. We had to stand in line to wait for a loaf of bread. I would have a lot to say, but I don t want to.

You wore dresses, you wore stockings and high heeled shoes, and what a fool we were to do those kinds of things. [Laughs] JF: But I think there&#8217;s&#8212;. It&#8217;s a shame it has to be that way but&#8212; LL: No, you know&#8212; JF: &#8212;there is something to it. LL: &#8212;I shouldn&#8217;t have said that because I really don&#8217;t believe that. Having a granddaughter, I&#8217;m mightily distressed now with women on television. You look at male newscasters, they&#8217;re all up there with suits and ties and looking all put together and you see women newscasters and they&#8217;re in all kinds of revealing clothes, skirts up to here, and I don&#8217;t get it. I don&#8217;t know what this means or how one is supposed to think of these women. There was a situation on the news not too long ago; I think it was in Boston, up east someplace. A woman was raped and somehow managed to survive. It was intended to be a homicide. One of the newscasters, like an idiot, asked the sheriff, how can women protect themselves from this kind of random violence, and he said stop dressing like sluts. And of course the national media, CNN, went bananas; here we go, blaming the victim again. He apologized and retracted his statement, but there was a kernel of truth there which he should have figured out a better way to talk about. There is an element of you&#8217;ve got to stop dressing provocatively if you&#8217;re going into a bar in a seedy side of town. I&#8217;m very conscious of the fact that my granddaughter, she wants to be a princess. She idolizes these popular singers, these women who could just as well be standing up there stark naked as far as I&#8217;m concerned. So I have mixed feelings about it, and yes we did always look put together when we went to class, but I&#8217;m not entirely comfortable with women&#8217;s fashions right now. I&#8217;ll put it that way. Of course I&#8217;m sure my granddaughter will win when it comes to any argument. [Laughs] But I would have to admit that I guess I grew up in a pretty conservative household because I&#8217;m beginning to remember my father wouldn&#8217;t let me wear those short skirts that we used to wear to the roller rink and roller skating was a really big deal when I was growing up and I just thought that was terrible. I just wouldn&#8217;t go if I couldn&#8217;t dress like everybody else. Then of course you become aware of how much young people want to be just like everybody else. They don&#8217;t want to be different. But I&#8217;m uneasy about modern fashion, I will say that, and I&#8217;m not blaming the victim; I&#8217;m just saying be smart. On the other hand, being smart means knowing how to take care of your self I think, and I won&#8217;t go any further.

Yes. Joan Hastings and Helen Arnold, both republicans, had already been in the legislature, but there were three new democrats. We had a total it was our all-time high a total of five women legislators in the House from Tulsa. Alene Baker and Twyla Mason and I were the three new ones. All Tulsa area House members , except for Joan Hastings, supported the Equal Rights Amendment. At any rate, there we were, we women, sitting in this committee on the judiciary. We actually were on the subcommittee of juvenile justice. That was my interest, policy for young people, but we were part of this larger committee of the judiciary. A legislator by the name of Frank Shurden had this bill he became known as the legislator who was for castration for those who had committed rape. At this point, he had the bill that called for alternate death sentences for criminals, convicted criminals. They could choose 12 how they were going to die, how they would be put to death. I kept listening to this bill and these other women on the committee, these big Equal Rights Amendment supporters, who were saying, Oh, yeah. Great. That s just so American, you know, freedom of choice. I was thinking, What is wrong with this picture? So I finally got up my nerve and asked my first question, and that was, How would you write the job description for the executioner? I mean, we re talking about people. One of the lines of the bill was, You may choose to die in the way you did in your victim. It was kind of screw-y language, and then everybody started looking at the language and so, finally, we defeated the bill, the alternate death penalty bill. But it was just a strange bill. So then I found out that I really could ask a question and that questions can sometimes lead to the right outcome if you just find the right question. (Laughs) So I spent a lot of my time thinking of the right questions.

Goldstein: What were you doing, exactly? In terms of these new feminist consciousness raising groups? Lamphere: Well, I worked on a number of different things. You know, first we did sort of consciousness raising. And then we decided well, we should do something at Brown, right? And, Bev Daniels and Karen Romer didn't come until ˜72. But somewhere in there we were trying to figure out how to get to the community. And it turned out when we started doing that, the people who were most interested in having some connection with Brown were like faculty wives and other people who lived on the East Side. So out of that, I think, some of the administrators like Karen sort of worked on having, you know. a program for older women to return to Brown. And some of that involved, beginning to sort of do women's studies courses. But we did things like, I mean some people were involved in establishing a rape crisis center. But we als--I remember there was a big hearing at the, the statehouse, over abortion rights. And, you know, we never figured we would get very far with it because Rhode Island was such a Catholic state. But there was a committee that was hearing, you know, an abortion rights bill and a bunch of us went down and did testimony for it. And the room was completely crowded. And the issue was, was it going to get out of committee into the legislature, and I don't think it even did that. But there was beginning to be this ferment about, around these women's issues like rape crisis and abortion and, you know, women's rights in general.

But that you personally can make a change in things if you work with organizations that are trying to make change, become part of social movements that are trying to make change. And one of the things I'm trying to do in an article I'm going to write for feminist--sort of new feminist stuff going on in anthropology is about the relationship between women and social movements, because we came out of a social movement in the ˜70s. And the African-American women and the Latina women in anthropology that became feminist anthropology came out of social movements, out of the civil 48 rights movement, and out of the La Raza movement. And they all contributed to the diversification of feminist anthropology. But now you get--we get women who are studying other social movements. Some of which they're part of, like women are interested in migration and immigrant rights, doing feminist work on immigrant rights. Other women are working on food sustainability, issues about, you know, things that have come back up like rape, abuse against women, abortion rights still there. You know, that kind of stuff. And then a lot of women are in the LGBT movement, and working for marriage equality and so forth. So I've got students that have been working on those issues, people that are putting out some collections right now. So there's a whole stream of feminist anthropology where we've taken this idea that the personal is political, and [2:45:00] carried it into our research as being more, sort of, public anthropologists. Anthropologists who are working on critical social issues today, that are being pushed forward by new social movements. And understanding the relationship between these social movements and social change, and how you actually effect change, what mistakes social movements make, how they get anything done, where they get defeated, how they do confront people who have the opposite point of view, et cetera. So I think there's a way in which social movements have been very important to feminist anthropology, and continue to be in this kind of new way.

Goldstein: So, you began out of a very personal event. And this grew into something that was institutional, it was social. Where did that transformation occur, or was it there all along, that it wasn't just about you? Lamphere: Well the part that was there already was my participation in the feminist movement since 1970, okay? So already I had the idea that, you know, there are problems that women have in the world that are generated by their position in the society, right? And those things, you know, maybe abortion rights, or rape, or job discrimination. So I think if I hadn't have been a feminist with that kind of consciousness, I couldn't have come to seeing this tenure case as a piece of a larger thing.

CCM: Well, I actually had a good time, but I didn't retreat, which is what most of the women did, for--in some cases because they ended up with quite horrific family responsibilities that -- many of them did that from the very beginning. They felt very uncomfortable and very threatened by the male environment and the sexual attention. [You had a great deal of attention?] [35:00] from your male colleagues. DB: And those were the days before sexual harassment proceedings, etc., etc. CCM: Yes, but some of it... I mean, actually, these things are not difficult to manage, though I have been told recently, even by some of my active friends and colleagues, that it's probably being southern that made it easier for me.

First of all, southern belles certainly are supposed to be indirect and covert in getting what they want. I've never been successful with that.

(laughs) So the others [pulled back into some kind of shell?]? CCM: So the others just mostly pulled back into their shell and retreated the second year. The first year I was around, it was mostly just the Yale junior staff, which was a widely thriving 31 group of about 35 to 40 people, 10 of them hired in my year, and eight the next year, or something like that. Just an enormous bulge. The Yale faculty was never, I think, as large again as it was in '68, '69, or '68 to '70. The faculty always used that as their benchmark when they started talking about faculty cuts. DB: (laughs) Right. CCM: Everybody knows how to use statistics to their advantage. Or Ã¢Â€ÂœFind your best base here.Ã¢Â€Â DB: (laughs) Exactly. CCM: [37:00] But I don't know.

They could not distinguish what was not play, and not serious, or not serious unless you made certain kinds of responses. There might've been some invitation there, but you were certainly free -- DB: To not respond? CCM: --“ to keep it at a certain level, without it pushing past that level.

I m not sure they welcomed the change. 10 Nykolaiszyn Coats-Ashley Nykolaiszyn Coats-Ashley Nykolaiszyn Coats-Ashley Did you tend to sit in the front of the class or towards the back of the class?

Certainly. When I was teaching in the areas of marketing and business, it was again, a male-dominated area. I think there were not role models in those days to say, Here s how you handle yourself as being the only female. I wasn t quite sure if the group went to coffee or somebody asked me to go to coffee, am I supposed to go? Does that mean it s a date? I worked through it. I was just trying to be as professional as possible but it was really awkward. When I decided I wanted to be a college professor. I needed the credentials to do that. I really needed the doctorate so I researched it. I 10 Nykolaiszyn Martin Nykolaiszyn found out that the best place in the nation to do this at the time was Ohio State. I was living in Arkansas. I had a three year old son and a former husband who told me that, Women don t do those things. So it was a real big dilemma to figure out how I am going to get this degree, if that s what I want to do for the rest of my life and how do I handle all this. It was a huge decision to go to Ohio State. I had planned to take my son with me while I did that, and then get my degree and come back. There was going to be one job in the state of Oklahoma that possibly would be available, that I might be able to qualify for. So I went based on that job being open and obviously it was and I did get the job. After I got there it was, again, a male dominated program. I thought, What am I doing here as a woman who left her family because she wanted to get this degree for the future? I did not know of any other women and that was what my ex-husband told me. He said, Name another woman who has done this. I could not come up with one, so I thought, This is really unusual. When I got the job as a college professor, I was the only female in the college of business. And it took me awhile to figure it out, but I was sexually harassed for a period of time, and I kept thinking, Something s wrong with me, I m causing that. For a while I just didn t know what was going on. I finally realized that s what it was. So I went and talked to the dean about it and he took care of it right away. But, it was a little painful to go through that because I respected the person and yet I thought it was me and didn t realize that there was more there. So, that was painful. I think sometimes just not having that female role model to say Yeah, somebody has done this before, and somebody has left their family to go do this. It s not, I m not abnormal, and to work through the sexual harassment. Then, once I came here and was in the CareerTech field, my former supervisor and mentor, Bruce Grey, took me under his wing. He took me to the superintendent s meeting and again, there would not be women there. But he treated me so professionally. Everybody else treated me professionally and it was very smooth and so I did not feel tremendous pressure for being a woman, necessarily. Nowadays the climate has changed It has changed, it has. There are those women out there and those administrators, and it is different. I was doing some research and I think something that you do here at Francis Tuttle that s really important to you is educating young girls and minorities about non-traditional career fields. Can you touch upon that for me please? 11 Martin Nykolaiszyn Martin Nykolaiszyn That s been one of my passions because, again, when I grew up you didn t go into a non-traditional field. From my vantage point, because I didn t know anyone who had these other positions but the teacher, the secretary or the nurse those were the jobs for women. And so I have felt really passionate about giving women opportunities for other positions because they can do any of those jobs. So some of our non-traditional programs for women would be, for example, the engineering program. I m very passionate about the number of women, they tell me there s about 25 percent, but I think there s less than that because, again, so many young women don t grow up with the female role model of an engineer. We started a program called GirlTech and each girl who is in one of these non-traditional areas is paired with a mentor who helps them through some of those tough times or gives them somebody to talk to. For example, the girls in pre-engineering will be paired with a female engineer and that gives them a huge opportunity to work through some of those challenges. In our automotive technician program, there s tremendous opportunities for women because they can be so skilled in those areas. But it s a tough, tough thing. Our society still does not look favorably, sometimes, upon women being automotive technicians or they, again, could be harassed. I try to encourage any of those women in those areas because they re great paying jobs. It gets them out of a financial hole and gives them a tremendous opportunity.

Speaker 1: Anita Hill came along, is that how we? Speaker 2: No, no, no. Anita Hill didn't come, Clarence Thomas came along. Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry, Clarence Thomas came along, that's wrong, that's right. Speaker 2: And there were two different things and--in fact, I'm still trying to get the research--when Thomas was nominated by President Bush [George H. Bush] to the Supreme Court, I was leaving the Recorder of Deeds Office. This is toward the end of my ten-year tenure. I was going into the private sector again. I had lined up a job with a law firm, you know, and was ready to go in that direction. Story_ID: 16730 Speaker 1: I was invited to appear on that 'Chicago Tonight' show that John Callaway was hosting to talk about the President's nominee for the Supreme Court. George [Herbert] Bush, Sr had nominated
Clarence Thomas and I knew, just because of my involvements in, you know, the legal community, I knew that Thomas had a very, very, right wing, antediluvian record on civil rights. He had been [Ronald] Reagan's point man in dismantling the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] and stopping a lot of the progress that that agency had represented. And the idea that he would take the position held by Thurgood Marshall was just more than I could take. And so I went on the television show, and I've never been one to mince words, and so I was probably less than diplomatic, as I am being right now. But anyway, less than diplomatic and talking about this particular nomination. And the result was the phone started ringing even as the next day and people saying, "Oh we think you're just wonderful. We think it's terrific." This is when the letter from Murphysboro happened. I got a letter, no, no, no, the letter was later. So I started getting phone calls telling me what a great job you did on the Callaway show, da-da, da-da, we think it's terrific. So then, of our two senators, Paul Simon and Alan Dixon, Simon was very clear early, that he was going to oppose the Thomas nomination. Dixon equivocated and Dixon had a record of supporting certain Repub-, the President's nominations all during the Reagan years. But also, as a very conserve-, what we call a Reagan Democrat. I mean, he supported President Reagan more often that not on just about everything and yet had, you know, obviously maintained his position as senator for the whole state of Illinois. And I just thought that it was an error for him to support Thomas's nomination. So then there was one other television program that I did, and this one was with Susan Getzendanner, and Susan and I were now talking about the Thomas nomination. And following that, there was some beginning talk about if Dixon won't commit, you know, maybe we're going to have to run someone against him or threaten him or at least scare him a little bit. Lo and behold, Alan Dixon voted to confirm Clarence Thomas, even though the women in Illinois had been, you know, really anxious that he not do so and calling him right at his office. I'm skipping ahead actually because before that happened, the Thomas nomination happened in two parts. The first part was just on Clarence Thomas and on his record at the EEOC. And then there was a recess in the proceedings that went on for about two weeks. And, it was during that period that the Anita Hill revelations became known. And so then we had this whole period which Anita Hill was on television and the Senate hearings were being televised. People were looking at the Senate for the first time and not seeing anybody that looked like them, paying attention to the process, and the proceedings, and to the power that these guys had. Story_ID: 16731 Speaker 1: During that period, some people had started to say well you know, maybe you could think about just giving [Alan] Dixon a scare and saying you're gonna run against him if he votes for Clarence Thomas. I didn't, frankly, at that point, really take it all that seriously. It was just the thought that was kind of protest politics at that point. And then as Anita Hill's testimony went on, the women, as you know, became more and more enraged really about not just what had happened to her, not just the sexual harassment that she had experienced, but the fact that the members of the committee just didn't seem to get it that this was a major economic issue for women. And at the time, I remember having conversation after conversation that most professional women who have worked in the workplace had had some incident of sexual harassment. Everybody had a story of, you know, the boss who, you know, touched their breasts or their back or their legs or something, or who, you know, asked them out for dates or whatever. So this was something that resonated with women across the board. And the fact that there were no women in the Senate. Well, there were two at the time: we had Nancy Kassebaum on the Republican side, Barbara Mikulski on the Democratic side and that was really it. And so the fact that the Senate was 98 percent rich, white, and male, and that there was nobody reflecting the rest of America there who could even explain it to them, what was going on, really infuriated a lot of people. When the vote came, in spite of all the opportunities from the women in my state, Dixon voted to confirm Clarence Thomas. And it happened in kind of almost serendipity, again--. It happened that he did so on a Thursday, I think the vote was on a Thursday evening, we're checking this, either Thursday or Friday. But whatever happened, his office was closed for the next two days because of the hot weekend, and then there was the Columbus Day holiday. So he went either three or four days--I think it was either three or four days, it could have even been five, I think four is right--in which his phones weren't being answered at all. And you had women from all over Illinois calling to protest and their phone calls were not getting answered at all. So that just poured salt in the wound and exasperated the anger at the vote that he had made. And so at that point, I was still recorder of deeds and I got a letter from a man in Murphysboro, Illinois. I finally remembered the name of the town, Murphysboro. Murphysboro is down in far southern Illinois. And this person had apparently done some business with the Recorder of Deeds office. Remember, this was an office that before I got there, the term right before [Harry] Bus Yourell--. In fact, ten people who had worked in that office had gone to jail under federal indictments for taking bribes. So it was an office that had been rife with corruption, had been just a bureaucratic nightmare to get through. The employees were dispirited and disheartened. The public hated using it. It was just a bad situation. Anyway, so this guy wrote and he said, basically, "I've used your office many times over the years and I have to tell you I've never seen it work as nicely as it does now. The people are actually friendly and they are nice and they won't take tips and dat, dat, dat", he went on. And he says, "I think you should run for Senate." And so I really--. The letter became a real comment because it was like, wait a minute, I got people down in Murphysboro, Illinois, saying I should run for the Senate. There must be something to this. At the time there were two other women who were interested, kind of. Marge Benson, Marge Benton, who had been involved in Democratic Party politics, and who was a wealthy woman in her own right, Marge was flirting with it a little bit. And then Susan Getzendanner was flirting with it a little bit. But as it turned out, because I was a person already in an elective office, I had the constituency base from which to move immediately into a campaign. And so, even though, at the time, like I said, there was more protest politics than anything else, we started our little campaign and that was the beginning of it.

Speaker 1: -- because of-- Speaker 2: Because that's where the passion was, that's where the call was. Although the work I did was also passion. I think by '85 [1985]--oh, I know, between '81 [1981] and '85 [1985], I worked for the Child Abuse Prevention Program [sic., Child Assault Prevention Project]. Sally Cooper was the director, CAP, that's right, Child Abuse Prevention. And actually, I found the job in the Call and Post. They were looking for a part-time writer to develop a curriculum for special needs kids on child abus
 prevention. And they hired me because my--you know, I have a undergraduate degree from Norfolk State [College, later, Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] in special ed [special education] and a master's from Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] in learning disabilities and behavioral disorders. So it looked like I was good. Speaker 1: But you were hired basically as a publicist for them, I mean to write content (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: No, I actually wrote the curriculum. Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so you wrote, okay. Speaker 2: Yeah, I actually wrote the curriculum. Speaker 1: So you wrote a curriculum, okay. Speaker 2: Right, and then we tested it out on special needs kids and, what's the word--refined it. And then I think it was used around the country for quite some time.

 and I would do it at the "Y" [Young Women's Christian Association, YWCA]. So that was the agreement. So the mayor sent Marie Hardy, no Marie Harden [ph.] and myself to represent the City of Columbus, Ohio at the End of the Decade World Conference for Women in Nairobi, Kenya. And it was absolutely the most mind-changing experience of my life. Twenty-two days in Africa--I had never been to Africa. This was my first time, and I felt like I was from Nairobi, Kenya. I felt like I had gone home. It was amazing. I did not feel foreign. I did not feel like I was a black woman going home, you know. I just felt like this is where I belonged. I met the most incredible women, market women, bank presidents. Story_ID: 174797 Speaker 1: We--and I don't know how this all happened because you were kind of like on your own in Nairobi, Kenya, but I met a, like a media person--maybe somebody like Bradley, Bradley--what's his first name? Speaker 2: Ed Bradley? Speaker 1: Ed Bradley, somebody like Ed Bradley in Nairobi, and he took tons of pictures of me and the women I was with [at the Third World Conference on Women]. And he got us into all kinds of receptions with the president, the president's wife. We went to, oh, we went to many receptions that probably would have never gotten into 'cause, you know, we were just women going to the conference. Speaker 2: Now, who was the president then (unclear)? Speaker 1: Oh, I do not remember. I don't. Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of it myself and I can't--I'm drawing a blank here. Speaker 1: But his wife was very active in the women's community, and so it was just wonderful. Speaker 2: Now, was Wangari Maathai involved? Speaker 1: Yes, yes, but I didn't know her then. You know, I was just, I was just awestruck. Speaker 2: Did you hear her speak or anything or did you (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, I did hear her speak, yes-- Speaker 2: --find out what she was doing? Speaker 1: --yes, knew what she was doing. Speaker 2: She organized women and just, you know. Speaker 1: Right, but this was, so this was in '85 [1985]. So, she was just early starting out. But one of the things that happened maybe that first four or five days, even if you couldn't speak each other's language--'cause there were like fifteen thousand women from around the world, I mean literally around the world. No matter where you were from, there were certain things about you being a woman that you could share with a woman from anywhere, from Bangladesh, from Sweden, from Canada, from a small village, from Ghana, I mean just everywhere, small island off the, off the coast of South America. No matter where you were from, it was like--it was like all the men of the world had gone some place, agreed how they were gonna treat women, and then went back home because no matter where this woman was from, we all had the same stories about childbirth. We all had the same menstruation stories. We had all the same horrible stories about how we were treated in every place. You know, women were raped in every place, they were beat up in every place; they, they, women talked about their stories of misogyny, they talked about their rights of passage stories that were awful, just--and then somehow this gloriousness of being a woman and finding your own voice, and your own sense of agency, and not wanting to lose that. It was, it was miraculous. I came back home, and I was, I was so fired up. And what I said to my friends is, "When these--when I meet with these white women and we start talking about policy--" because at that time in Columbus [Ohio], the white women were starting to galvanize around women's health issues. And I was right there at the table, sometimes one of maybe two black women or sometimes the only black woman. And so one of the things that I said was--

Speaker 1: Now, didn't, now, I think maybe, I'm thinking like how do you feel about--I think maybe in one area especially, black, the Women's Movement helped black women. Speaker 2: How? Speaker 1: Maybe I'm getting it wrong, but tell me if I am. Speaker 2: Where? Speaker 1: In the area of domestic violence. White women organized around that issue and--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Here's what happened-- Speaker 1: --and it filtered to us. Speaker 2: When the white Women's Movement began, lesbian women and women who had been real victims of men started joining the movement and really and truthfully, it was not even women who were real victims. I take that back. When lesbian women joined the movement, their issues of, and issues of child abuse came out. Before then, those wealthy, white women were looking at economics solely. Lesbian women joined, issues of gender discrimination really came up, but also issues of child abuse, molestation, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, domestic violence, rape. All those issues really began to surface, and you are right for many black, activist women, domestic violence came up as a big issue. Child sexual abuse, incest, all of those issues really came up, and, truthfully, it was the Women's Movement and the voice of lesbian women that created children's rights. We didn't have real children's rights back then, and that's when children's rights had--so if there, if there was a huge contribution then, of course, it was the fact that the rights of children was born as a result of that Women's Movement. But, you know, there are a lot of thinkers, especially thinkers of color and women thinkers of color, who believe that the Women's Movement and the white Women's Movement was a--was--what's the word I want to use? It circumvented the rest of the Civil Rights Movement because the Civil Rights Movement was really perceived as being a black movement for the most part. And in our community, black men were like lifted up. They got the jobs. They found their voic
. They found their place, short-lived, but, in fact, did. I believe had we been politically allowed to continue, even after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, if we had begun to continue to take that force and continue the work, we would have heard the voice of black women in a way we would have never have heard it. And it wouldn't have been just singular black women like [HM] Angela Davis. There were a number--C. Delores Tucker. There were a number of women but singular in their voice. I believe that we would have heard the collective voice. You'd have seen more sisters in the streets, not rioting but reclaiming our families and members of our families. We would have had a great voice, and I just think it was political. This is just my own exp- you know, sometimes I'm a conspiracy theorist. I just believe that our movement was circumvented by the white Women's Movement. I believe that. Speaker 1: Do you think it siphoned off energy from black women that they would have used had the issue still been civil rights? Speaker 2: I think it was a political maneuver. That's what I think because had the voice, collective voice of black women been allowed, politically, to rise up, we would have brought the other sisters of color with us, and it would not have become a white Women's Movement after that.

Speaker 1: Do you remember anything that went wrong on the job that he [Jones' father, George Raymond Jones] was upset about or had, you know wanted to fight against (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes. Oh yes. Speaker 1: Can you--? Speaker 2: I mean there was a time that you know often, there were white females who would accuse my father and I--of being fresh. Now my father, like most men you know, most men who are--who see a woman who is attractive and all, you know they, some way they're going to respond. Maybe to themselves, they won't have an outward response but they're going to respond to it. And--but my father knowing, that the livelihood of his children and his wife [Estelle Campbell Jones] depended upon his decorum, had too much sense to have casual flirtations. He had too much sense for that. So a couple of times he got accused and the union was able to deal with it you know, and it didn't affect him. He was able to move on. But that has always you know made, it made me aware when I first came to legal [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] first as a lawyer, the plight of African American men and what men can endure when a woman makes a false claim. When a woman makes--it's an awful thing to do to a man. And so I come at it from that, you know. And I you know I think about all the death penalty cases I handled with men on death row for allegedly raping white women, throughout the South. When I became a lawyer that's what it was. And that's where I spent the first four years as a lawyer, fighting that, you know. So my father's experience I think shaped me in that 'cause he would come home and the union had to go to bat and blah, blah, blah, blah. So he had the--and then he had a couple of experiences--but they had a pleasant experience. He would come home and somebody gave him a big tip. That was a big deal. You know you could buy a week's groceries for eight dollars, then. I mean money was--you know eight dollars you'd buy a week's groceries and daddy would get a big tip and just be just tickled, you know.

Speaker 1: Well, in the class you had a lot of the gender stuff. You know you're taking up a place you know. The white females got that a lot, "You're taking up a place a man could be in." They wouldn't say to the individually-individual, but they would say it in front of the class. And then whenever a woman got a question it had something to do with you know somebody being raped or some domestic crime, or something. You know always--so what I remember was it was only one place for us to congregate as women, in the law school [University of Virginia School of Law, Charlottesville, Virginia] it was in the ladies room downstairs. It was a two room lady room situation--ladies room situation. You had the--you had in the one room you had a sitting area, and then you had the bathroom in a separate area and then there was a little kitchen area. And it used--I think it was primarily for the secretaries in the law school, had been. But it was where the law students, now that there were seven women in there, where we congregated. Seven women in my class. And we would congregate there, 'cause we would bump in and out. And we would sit around sometimes talking about your day and your day, and I would listen, you know. Now I would listen to their using each other as a focus group to talk through their issues, and they were open to me. I liked several of those women, I really liked. And they would, they--and I would listen to their experiences, and whatever was left over from them I assumed was race. See, I was trying to decide what was gender and what was race, in terms of what I was experiencing, you know. And it was complex, but I figured out which of my experiences were gender based and which were race because I, then I had Jimmy [James W. Benton, Jr.] who was in--Jimmy Benton and he and I could talk about it. But we both had our study groups in which we were of course the only--everywhere we went we were the only African Americans. Jimmy was in a separate study group from me. And there were some students at Virginia who embraced us. It was the radical left--I guess the whole school's considered radical. But there were students who were--went out of their way to reach out, you know, to me--and I will never forget that. And when we--'cause the first year was the most difficult. And I remember the stoning in the Peace Corps; I will not be deterred, I didn't come here to be a statistic.

And so he had a--he knew where the slot in his budget was. It was in capital punishment. And so he hired me as a member of the capital punishment team of lawyers. And so that's where I spent, you know, I'm immersed in those cases my first three, four years out of law school [University of Virginia School of Law, Charlottesville, Virginia]. And they was--again and I'm trying death penalty cases in Alabama. I'm getting folks off death row. Most black men in the South on death--were on death row for rape, allegedly raping white women. And they were convicted, you know, before you--and not only that, rape was a capital offense. A capital offense was any offense the state determined, any felony the state determined to be a capital offense. Nighttime burglary was a capital offense. Anything the state wanted to make a capital offense, was. And so that's the vibe we were functioning in.

Speaker 1: Now what about your, your mother, can you give her name? Speaker 2: My mother's name, from what I know, was Anne Johnson, and her story is a bit more complicated. My grandmother whom I did know, her mother, was raised in New Orleans [Louisiana], which I did go visit there after she left. My mother was born--my father [William Streeter], I didn't say, my father was born in two thousand--1906. He was eighty-eight when he died. He was ninety- ninety-eight, I guess, or ninety-six, something and my mother was born in 1912. Now I didn't learn any of this about my mother until about nineteen ninety--1978, '79 [1979] in talking with her because they didn't talk. My mother, my grandmother had three other children before my mother. My mother looks white, apparently her father was, and my grandmother gave her away to a white woman in the town, and I'm not sure if it was Mississippi or Memphis [Tennessee]. So my mother was raised white until she was seven. At age twelve her grandmother, her mother's mother, found out about this and went and got her on the other side of town, so then she was moved and was in the black section. Difficult. Then her grandmother dies and her mother at this point, who I think was probably a woman of the night (laughter); it just does not sound other than that. She had moved to Chicago [Illinois] so she had to move all of the children to Chicago. So there they are in Chicago, my mother, who I never got taller than, and it was just, she went to Wendell Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and that was difficult and I never realized how difficult it was until much later in life. That explained a lot of my mother's moods, and then she was raped at sixteen (laughter). Speaker 1: So she was raised-- Speaker 2: Until she was seven, white. Speaker 1: --white. And I've heard some of those stories before with people, it's very co- and then, so how did that manifest then with her? Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION) Speaker 1: Okay. So how did that manifest? Speaker 2: She had lots of mood swings (laughter) to put it mildly, but she was a very strong person. She didn't take any stuff so to speak and I think that, that's how they raised me, to just not put up with things. Speaker 1: Now her mother's name was Mamie-- Speaker 2: Mamie, Mamie Hardy, that's, you know, and I remember the man Mamie was with whether they were married or not. And Mamie lived with us off and on, and she liked to gamble. And so she would, we shared a bedroom, and she would go out and gamble and come back with money. She was in her sixties and she was fairly progressive. She took me to New York [New York], she took me, I think I was twelve when she took me to New York. Then she took me to New Orleans when I was sixteen. And back then you didn't wear black. She went and bought me a black suit with fox cuffs which was not, young girls didn't wear black (laughter) when I was sixteen, but my grandmother was fairly progressive. Story_ID: 644945 Speaker 1: I was--I would--and I had a brother, my mother's first child, he was sixteen years older. Speaker 2: Sixteen years older (simultaneous)? Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixteen years older than I. Speaker 2: I see. What was his name? Speaker 1: William Fransioli. So my mother [Anne Johnson] did marry the young man that impregnated her and so I remember seeing him a couple of times coming, but I was like a favorite child. I mean I was spoiled and my parents had me late. For that period my mother was thirty, my father [William Streeter] was thirty-six because she lost lots of children in between and so that was old. I always thought my parents, I have the oldest parents around, but they were very, very, I think they were very progressive in a sense that they made sure I knew everything. I knew which uncle not to sit on their lap. If someone got near me, I was to tell them. We had people that were gay in the family, but that was all right. You know we didn't call it gay then. I forgot what you call it (laughter). Speaker 2: Sissies? Speaker 1: Yes, yes. Speaker 2: Sissy. Speaker 1: But that was the family and so everyone was included and they were very good about me. Now they didn't always get along, they argued, but I never felt there was any problem with them caring for me. I didn't have anything to do with that. And as I said they made sure I knew everything and I went to a Catholic school, oh, that was something. I lived at 65th [Street] and Langley [Avenue]. And-- Speaker 2: Is that where you were born at 65th? Speaker 1: Right, that's where they were, in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois]. And the Catholic school in the neighborhood was Holy Cross [Holy Cross School, Chicago, Illinois], but Holy Cross didn't take black children back in the '40s [1940s] so I sent to St. Anselm's [St. Anselm's School, Chicago, Illinois] which did, and that was at 61st [Street] and Michigan [Avenue], and I remember my mother at that time was a waitress at the Pershing Hotel [Chicago, Illinois] and also she did dispatching for the livery service because the regular cabs didn't pick us up. So I went to school in a cab, or a livery car because my father never learned how to drive, we didn't own a car; and so I was taken to school over (laughter) in a, in a livery car. Story_ID: 644946 Speaker 1: So let me ask you, what did--how did your parents meet? Did you ever figure out that story? Speaker 2: From what I gathered, my mother's [Anne Johnson] second husband, and I don't remember his name, was a friend of my father's [William Streeter] and apparently he was just supposed to just kind of watch out for her. Well I guess it got a little bit more than that (laughter) because they ended up getting married. Speaker 1: So now, who, do you know about your mother's first husband? Speaker 2: No. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: I only know the name, and I remember seeing him once. Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Don't know the second one at all. Story_ID: 644947 Speaker 1: So when did you find out that your mother [Anne Johnson] was raped at age sixteen? Was that much later? Speaker 2: That was--I didn't find that out until 1978 or so. I didn't--we were talking, I was at Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island]. Walter [Massey's husband, HistoryMaker Walter E. Massey] was the dean of the college at Brown and my mother was there, and we were talking about my older son [Keith Massey] going off to college and she was saying, "Well I didn't let you go." I said, "What do you mean," and then she started talking about herself, and that was the first I had ever known, and that's when I told her, I said, "I think you're pretty sane having gone through that," (laughter). "You raised me."

And so I was, I ended up being there for five years and the young lady that I met at Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.], we both started at the same time and at that time I think there were maybe two or three other blacks in reservations, and after a while you're supposed to go on days, and I never, I didn't get on days and I'm watching other people get on days even the young woman I started with, and then I know what happened. The supervisor who's from Indiana, Mr. Burwell [ph.], he would come around and touch you. Well you know men did that right? Speaker 2: They did. I was gonna say, that was the thing of the pinch touch. Speaker 1: Oh, and I said, "Don't touch me," and the young girl next to me she says, "Well he, you have to." I said, "No I don't have to, I don't have to," so I never got on days. And I'm wondering, I said, oh, that's 'cause I told him, "You don't put your hands on me." And then supervisors at night were women, two women, you know, shift changeover, and I said well, you know, I'm gonna have to address this and I can't address it to him by himself. So I waited until the three supervisors, the two women and he were in the, 'cause he was he manager over everything. We're in the office together. And I went in, I clearly remember this. I said, you know, "You haven't put me on days because I wouldn't let you touch me." I said, "If you don't put me on days, I'm going to New York [New York] and speak to Mr. Tillinghast [Charles C. Tillinghast, Jr.]." I only knew that he was chairman, I didn't know him. Fast forward, when Walter [Massey's husband, HistoryMaker Walter E. Massey] went to Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island], I met Mr. Tillinghast and I told him the story because he was a Brown graduate. But, I got put on days. And-- Speaker 2: This is 1968, right? Speaker 1: This is, no this is probably, let's see I married in '69 [1969], this was probably about '65 [1965].

I had a job when I got out of school here working for the department--it was then called the Department of Public Welfare [Wisconsin Department of Public Welfare; Wisconsin Department of Health Services], and I was hired before I graduated. So I had a job and it made sense to stay here since I had a job. And that's when I met--my first day at work, I met Lydia Brown [ph.] and I came in to work the same day together, and we were hired to investigate child abuse. Speaker 1: Okay. Now-- Speaker 2: We were child abuse investigators.

We were friends, have been friends since. Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Speaker 2: And the investigating child abuse was very--I never really knew about child abuse or about, you know, how children were hurt and killed as a result of abuse and neglect, so that was a rude awakening to me. And one of my first experiences was because we would go all over the city. We would get a complaint and, you know, if it landed with you, you had to go out to the home to investigate. And I remember Lydia and I going into a trailer park on the South Side of Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and this was going to obviously be a white family. And I remember the woman opening the door and saying, "I'm not letting any jungle bunnies in my house. What are you all doing here?" (Laughter) I looked at Lydia, I said, "What's a jungle bunny?" (Laughter) 'Cause I had never heard that before. She said I'll--she said, "I'll tell you when we get in the car, but I'm not going in there either." So, we were clear with our supervisors that we did not want to go into the white community to try to investigate child abuse, you know. Speaker 1: Because another issue pops up.

As black Americans, you know, you want success. And, so you could, you could argue that, that having a successor to the black [U.S.] Supreme Court justice, who's also black, it's a certain measure and indicator of successful, sort of.

 I was in favor of Clarence Thomas, which I was not. But, you know, I'm really not even making that judgment-- Speaker 1: Right. Speaker 2: I'm just saying that-- Speaker 1: And, that not, yeah, I'm not asking you to. Speaker 2: That it's just, you want the, yeah, you want someone to be--you want it to be perfect, and it isn't. And, so, it was embarrassing. And, but, it brought up a lot of other issues. That again, you know, it's interesting, whenever you try to sweep these issues under the rug, they always have a way of coming out at the worst possible time. And, so, again, you know-- Speaker 1: What issues came out of that, they say? Speaker 2: Well, you know, the--you know, sexism, you know. Sexual harassment in the workplace. These were all issues that, you know--and, and they dealt with it by trying to discredit, you know, Anita Hill. As if, you know, she was trying to sabotage America or something like that, you know. I mean, yeah, she was sabotaging somebody's agenda, you know. Yeah, but, I don't know, I just don't know. I don't think it was proven that this was some sort of put up job that, you know, that someone put her up to it so that this, so that he would be discredited so that he wouldn't be confirmed. But, I don't think that that's ever been established that that was so. I mean, so she just, you know, as a matter of her conscious, spoke out. And, I think it took a, it was a--and I think it took an incredible act of courage for her to do it. And, there was nothing in it for her. And, look what happened to her. I mean, she seems she's fine-- Speaker 1: What happened to her? Speaker 2: Well, she, she, she's--I mean, first of all, she was subject to a great deal of sort of public abuse, scrutiny, unprecedented scrutiny of her personal life. Untru- you know, lies were told about her. And, and, she--I mean, ultimately she went back and someone, you know, ineffective (laughter), degree and I guess, I don't know, you know. And, and she's teaching and she seems to be fine. But, I mean, to have had to, to say--and, she had to know, she had to know once she did that, that she was letting herself in for just an incredible amount potential, you know, abuse and some, and she took it. Speaker 1: Last questions about that. What did race have to do with their story, Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill, from your perspective? From the way it was covered? The way people saw it in the media? Speaker 2: Well-- Speaker 1: What did race have to do with it? Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mean, here you have two black people and so, some people felt, I mean, it depends on how you were looking at it. Some people felt that Anita Hill should never have done that because it's a black man and it's embarrassing and, you know. And, Cla- and other people felt that Clarence Thomas was not the appropriate person to have that job, because, just because he was a black man. He didn't share Justice Marshall's [Thurgood Marshall] opinions and philosophy, and judicial philosophy at all. In fact, he was total opposite that. So, a lot of people felt he wasn't qualified. But, they, they looked for somebody black who, you know, who didn't represent the black community in terms of his, his views. And, so, they felt that he was not, you know, the right candidate for the job. And, so, I, I mean, everybody had a different sort of way of viewing it through this prism, you know. And, certainly, like I said, if it had been a white justice or, you know, person from some other ethnic group and, let's--or Japanese. And, then a Japanese woman came and said, don't--you know, and sort of accused him of sexual harassment. The issue was sexual harassment, really more than race, I think. And, I think that it just became almost more of a circus, you know, more sensational because (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So-- Speaker 2: Because the people were black. Speaker 1: Quickly tell me, do you know how it all came about? Can you, in a nutshell, He--she accused him or something or-- Speaker 2: Um-hm. Speaker 1: What was the historical reference is that he was being confirmed and then she accused him of sexual harassment. Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: And, that was--that's the end of the story. And, then it took on the life that we saw in the media. Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: All right. So, I was asking off-camera who were some of the people that worked with you? Speaker 2: It was Tony Gallegos, Ricky Silberman [Rosalie "Ricky" Silberman], Joy Cherian, and Evan Kemp [Jr.]. They were the first group. And then it was, there were, when the Republicans took over the two that were, came in I can't remember their names but they were two Democrats. One, I should say when the Democrats-- Speaker 1: Uh-huh. Speaker 2: --came in. Speaker 1: Now did you meet, I can't think of her, her name now, the, the young lady that, that contested with Clarence Thomas in the-- Speaker 2: Did not know Anita Hill. Speaker 1: Anita Hill, right. Speaker 2: Did not believe Anita Hill. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: You know, because the story number one, if you listened to the hearings, you heard her say I never said he sexually harassed me. I said he was sexually inappropriate that's what she said. The media flipped that into sexual harassment. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: If you look at what sexual harassment is, there even if he were sexually inappropriate, which I doubt very seriously, it would not be sexual harassment. Harassment is when you try to make somebody do something and they don't and then you impact their jobs negatively. If you don't do this, I'm not gonna promote you, I'm gone fire you, I'm gone do this, or you put your hands on 'em, or you're around them and you're speaking sexually all the time. You know, where you make the environment hostile where the person cannot work. You don't call a person as many times as she did, you don't go visit the person and try to have them give you rides and you give them rides somewhere. You don't do all that stuff, and claim how many years later? Speaker 1: Yeah, it was, yeah, several years later. Speaker 2: Right. You, you look at it and, you know, it, and you say, and then if you know the person you're going like eh, you know, I'm not seeing that. And I spent a lot of time around Clarence.

Speaker 1: So that's what we're doing here. And right now, part of what we're doing is we're working on international diversity. Countries have different policies and laws, many similar to ours. So where Boeing is located, we're working on how to address those issues. And we're located in many countries. Speaker 2: Okay. That can be pretty tricky right with all the (unclear) (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: Fascinating, fascinating. But there's laws, they're affirmative action laws in Canada. There are discrimination issues in Canada. They're affirmative action laws in Australia, and discrimination issues in Australia. There are laws in Japan, China. You know, so we're, we have a book that outlines all of the laws. And then dealing with the culture. You know, one thing consistently, no sexual harassment, no sex discrimination. We have core values that we deal with. Now in Saudi Arabia there may be some things you do differently. Speaker 2: Hmm. Speaker 1: You don't wanna put anybody in danger but you look at it so how can you accomplish these laws and deal with the local custom, unless the local custom is something that violates our core values. So that is really fascinating.

 Well, I d like to talk a little bit about some of things you ve been involved with and have you explain your role with these organizations. I d like you to tell me a little bit about Rainbow House. Rainbow House, let s see. I think that was in 1977 or 1978, and Rainbow House was a child abuse prevention program. It was a crisis nursery, where if one were to feel kind of at wit s end, had any concern that that crisis they were facing might end up with in any way neglecting or abusing their child, they could remove their child from that risk by simply taking them to Rainbow House. Rainbow House was a crisis nursery that was open 24/7. They just simply had to make a phone call to the taxi company with whom we had a partnership, the cab would pick them up and take them over to the Rainbow House, which was our partnership with the Tulsa what was called Vo-tech at that time. We had staff there that would care for them 24/7 until this crisis could be dissipated and the parent could come back for them. And then when parents would come back we could refer them to different education programs, different community resources, all to help them maybe prevent that kind of situation from happening again, or for knowing where to go and how to access establish community services should that situation arise again. Unfortunately Rainbow House was probably ahead of its time. That was at a time, I remember clearly, where the subject of child abuse wasn t even acceptable social conversation. I suppose there was some fear about it, and thankfully we ve gotten over that so we can help the children that need help. But it was a great grassroots experience and I want to give you some flavor to that, because I m really very proud of how the community responded. McDonalds, as you know, is a big company, so we were all just stay-at- 13 Nykolaiszyn Creveling Nykolaiszyn home moms, and just had this idea born out of coffee table talk, you know, What can we do to help the situation. I think we were all volunteers with DHS Department of Human Services and the children s protection registry at DHS. So this is something we came up with DHS, but we didn t know how to ask for the money or raise the money, or anything. I don t even know how we walked into McDonalds and told them what we were doing and asked what they could do. Well this man we have to be able to talk to was a franchisee and had like three or four McDonalds. What ended up happening was for, I think, two or three days in a certain time period, McDonalds permitted Rainbow House volunteers to come in, and we were behind the counter and we would serve all the customers that walked in. And previous to that we could sell these tickets that McDonalds gave us, and I don t think we had to pay for any of them. We could sell tickets for a meal you know, whatever the set meal was that they were promoting for five dollars. We sold them everywhere, all over the community, and then for those two or three days when they could redeem those tickets the volunteers would be behind the counter. We had our little gingham aprons, you know our Rainbow emblem. So it was 
abulous. In terms of a fundraiser, it raised at that time I think it raised 50,000, which was a lot of money. But it also raised so much awareness. Everybody liked McDonalds, and here we had fathers and wives and older children serving the community McDonalds food. That was a great story, but again it was ahead of its time. And at some point, there just wasn t the funding available, and we had to close it. I was president at the time and it was probably one of the hardest things I d ever done, to have to go to a staff who was very passionate and very committed to what they were doing, and to have to let them go because we couldn t raise the money to do it. But it ended up merging with what was then the Children s Registry at Hillcrest Medical Center, which then merged with Parents Anonymous, which is now the Parent Child Center, which is a wonderful facility here in Tulsa that is involved with prevention and parenting education. Well what a great thing for the community even, in that short time span to help open the doors I think it was that. I think it was a catalyst for the great programs we have in Tulsa now. I don t know whether or not you know, but Tulsa has model programs in the area of child abuse. Child Abuse Network is an organization I m involved with now, and that program has been replicated in Israel. That s impressive 14 Creveling Nykolaiszyn Creveling It is impressive. I think there s one in Jerusalem now and another one due to be built soon. So, we Tulsa have model programs. I like to think Rainbow House was although we probably made some people uncomfortable but it did raise the question and it did put the question on the table

Tell me about a key moment in your career, whether it s in your volunteer career or in your professional career that you consider one of your biggest highlights. And if you have more than one, that s okay, too. I ve really had a lot of great experiences. I guess highlights where, if you mean those occasions where there should be confetti falling and everybody celebrating, I guess a couple of those I could point out. One is the Child Abuse Network. I didn t know this at the time they invited me to serve on the board, but they could have been closing their doors at any time. (Laughs) You know, it s hardly ever the cause. It s sometimes being able to find the funding to continue the cause. The Child Abuse Network I don t know if you know about it. If you don t mind could I take just a minute to say, the Child Abuse Network is for child abuse there s a spectrum of services. There s prevention and then there s the prosecution of perpetrators. Child Abuse Network is involved only when the abuse has actually been reported, and so our work is to aid in the termination of abuse and then to aid in the assessment and the prosecution of the perpetrators. It s a very unique, and hopefully less unique as years go by, because hopefully it will be replicated. I already told you it s replicated in Israel. It s a co-location of the police department s child crisis unit, the DHS s children s protection unit, the OU Medical Clinic pediatrics unit, and the District Attorney has an office there. It s a wonderful co-location of people who 20 will deal with determining if there s been abuse and going after the perpetrator, if the abuse is proven. It s an expensive venture, because of the co-location of all those agencies, and child abuse still, it s a lot easier just to pick em up and lock em up, instead of do the forensic evidence and all that, which ultimately saves tax payer money and is more fair to all the parties involved and really protects the children. It also provides a one stop place for the child, so they don t have to go to the police department and give testimony. They don t have to go to DHS and give another testimony. So, for the child it is the best thing to do. But I didn t realize and I d been involved with it before, as it grew because it really was born out of a community survey that was led by the Junior League of Tulsa ten years prior, and I was involved in it at that time. So, here is ten years later, and as often happens in non-profits, they were struggling for money. I was invited to serve on the nominating committee, where they had a structure where they had people who were not on board and people on board, on the nominating committee. So it was a very wise nominating structure. Little did I know, from that nominating committee I would be asked on the board and then be vice-president on it, that very next year which, I did, given the interest I d had in the cause for a long time, Rainbow House preceding it by some ten years, fifteen years. So I did, and I ll never forget the Executive Director of ONEOK made a contribution of 5,000 and she started crying, and I didn t realize why. It was because with that 5,000 dollars she could keep the doors open another month. And that s what happens sometimes with non-profits. That s why when you ask about heroics in a volunteer world, really when you volunteer for good causes to help people it s easy to see heroics happen all the time. Ordinary people like me get a chance to get involved in situations which may be kind of heroic in terms of saving, and helping the people it does. Anyway all that said, I did that and then (Laughs) I think a year later I was chairman of the board. But, it is true that the board that we had at the time, and the board that came on, the board that we had the executive committee it just everybody, was so dedicated to it and within those two or three years we kept Child Abuse Network together. We were able to call in other community resources. And the Child Abuse Network today is very strong and very healthy and is now to be the anchor piece in what OU Tulsa is calling their Children s Park, where they will have not only the Child Abuse Network and its collated agencies but co-location on this entire campus of other organizations dedicated to children s health and children s well-being. So there ll be All Kinds of Minds which is geared towards children s education. I can t remember the other things that were named. So, the Child Abuse Network is to be the anchor of that campus of other organizations that really fight for children s well-being. So, and we re very proud of that and so at the end of those three 21 years I remember I just remember a huge celebration by everybody because there was money in reserve, which is always good, and our executive director was still there, and we managed to give her a staff another a couple of staff people and so that was one of those hoorays for sure.

So, I took part in all of those things and I organized a bazillion things. We organized like, a feminist counseling service out of those different kinds of services and consciousness raising groups and I mean there was just a lot of activity with many, many, many hundreds of women Ã¢Â€Â” all kinds of women Ã¢Â€Â” who were involved in it. All kinds of women and all kinds of points of view that were constantly Ã¢Â€Â”sometimes were working together, sometimes were arguing with each other. I remember someone brought in a copy of Ms. magazine and on the cover of Ms. magazine was this picture of this woman with a black eye and it was first time anybody actually talked about violence against women in that way. There was talk about rape, but not about battery and the person oddly, coincidently, weirdly enough that wrote that article was Del Martin, the same person that started the D.O.B. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s very weird. And so she started the Daughters of Bilitis in like the 1950s and she ended up writing this book called Battered Women and there was this cover of Ms. magazine an article that she wrote. We all started talking about it Ã¢Â€Â” a whole group of us got together Ã¢Â€Â” and we thought we should just keep talking about it and keep talking about it and we did and eventually we decided weÃ¢Â€Â™d start a battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelter. At the time there was a battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelter in England, in London. There was a battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelter in Minneapolis. And there was a battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelter in San Francisco. I think there might have been something or other in Boston and that was it for the country. So, we basically just made it up. I mean, we did a lot of reading. We did a lot of talking and we started announcing that we were starting to work on this. And all these women whose mother had been beaten up, whose sisters or themselves just started sort of coming to these meetings and started telling us what was going on. So, we opened this shelter for battered women Ã¢Â€Â” itÃ¢Â€Â™s called the Center for Battered Women Ã¢Â€Â“ it still exists Ã¢Â€Â” and there were three staff members at the time and I was one of them. We started this shelter which started small and now unfortunately, I think is now the biggest shelter I think in the country. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like just huge, humongous and itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a good thing, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think. So, I did that Ã¢Â€Â”I mean, there was a very long lead up to it, of course, I mean because we had figure out what the hell was going on and we had to train ourselves to do this work. Then over a period of a couple of years the shelter grew and we raised money. Over a period of years what happened was basically Ã¢Â€Â” and this had happened to the rape crisis movement too Ã¢Â€Â” it was changing from a movement into a social service and there were sort of competing ideologies. We always thought that you couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t stop battery without questioning patriarchy Ã¢Â€Â” thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the language of the times Ã¢Â€Â” and so, you know, a lot of what I did even when I was doing all of this direct service work was, I would go out and I would talk to all of these women Ã¢Â€Â“ you know, women who were in WIC programs, women who were getting welfare about what was going on and have political conversations, talk about our services but have political conversations. But more and more what started happening was that the people who were Ã¢Â€Â”this is such a complicated topic Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, this is so ironic Ã¢Â€Â” there was this book, itÃ¢Â€Â™s called The Prison and the Gallows and itÃ¢Â€Â™s written by this woman named Mary [inaudible] and it talks about the rise of incarceration and institutionalized incarceration in the United States. She looks at different movements, different social movements Ã¢Â€Â” victimÃ¢Â€Â™s rights movements, the battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement and the death penalty movement or the anti-death penalty movement and how they were transformed and in some ways co-opted to actually set the stage for the level of incarceration that we have now and itÃ¢Â€Â™s a very, very interest book, very, very interesting book. So, I get this book, I heard about it and I thought Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, this is really interestingÃ¢Â€Â because I was part of the battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, I was part of the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement and now IÃ¢Â€Â™m part of the prison abolitionist movement, you know, all of these years later Ã¢Â€Â” and so I started reading the book and in the first chapter on the battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, she quotes me! It was totally wild Ã¢Â€Â” so itÃ¢Â€Â™s like this weird circle Ã¢Â€Â” but what I am saying is that there were so many influences in terms of governmental influences, in terms of what they were supporting and what was put out there and the requirements for funding. All that the movement actually changed, was transformed and co-opted [it] into something that was not a political movement. They way it started Ã¢Â€Â” this happened with the rape crisis movement too Ã¢Â€Â” but it absolutely happened with the battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement so that there is no battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement anymore Ã¢Â€Â” what there are is battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelters. There are people who are professional people who do this, but theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not doing it, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not actually acting out of any kind of political context. So after, there was like this huge battle for the soul for the Center for Battered women and all of us that were the original people Ã¢Â€Â” most of the original people, all of the original people that were women who had been battered, all of the people who were women of color Ã¢Â€Â” all of us got thrown out. We lost the battle. And the sort of institutionalized professional women took over and that happened all around the country. It happened all around the country and we were providing really, really good services. We just also had a political context that we were acting out of. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not that their services became better, itÃ¢Â€Â™s just that they were depoliticized or a-politicized.

Or shaped yourÃ¢Â€Â” AHRENS: Yeah, I mean itÃ¢Â€Â™s interesting Ã¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know exactly how it has Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, other than thatÃ¢Â€Â™s part of the prison that I look at things with. But I mean, interestingly enough, I think that most of the vast, vast majority of people that I correspond with and visit are men. I mean of course thereÃ¢Â€Â™s many, many, like 200,000 women in prison Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, a lot more in jails, but 200,000 women in prison compared to Ã¢Â€Â” the number of women in prison now are the same number of people that were the complete total prison population. So, the number of women has gone up enormously, but the number of men has gone up so enormously. But itÃ¢Â€Â™s very Ã¢Â€Â” I was just talking to somebody about this Ã¢Â€Â” about why is i
 with so many people that I hear from Ã¢Â€Â” and IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been asked by different people that put out, like different periodicals for prisoners, if I have contact with women in prison. Somebody recently asked me, you know, they wanted to write to a woman in prison at Framingham and did I have any contacts there, but I hear from very few women. And I try to, I mean I always think about why. And even Ã¢Â€Â” letÃ¢Â€Â™s say I hear from Ã¢Â€Â” this woman I met, is doing, is writing this book on women who were prisoners in the United States Ã¢Â€Â” not political prisoners, just Ã¢Â€Â” letÃ¢Â€Â™s say a woman whoÃ¢Â€Â™s there because she robbed something or probably killed a husband or boyfriend or something like that. Not especially notorious women Ã¢Â€Â” just women in prison Ã¢Â€Â” and I said, when I met her, I said if you give me the names of these women youÃ¢Â€Â™ve been interviewing, IÃ¢Â€Â™ll send them comic books, Ã¢Â€Â˜cause one of themÃ¢Â€Â™s on women. So she gave me the list and I sent them and you know, I said bla bla, Vicky Blabla sent me your name and I sent them out and I never heard back from them. And not only didnÃ¢Â€Â™t I hear back from them, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t hear from anybody else in those prisons. Whereas, if I send a set of comic books to a man, even if that man is in segregation Ã¢Â€Â” which means heÃ¢Â€Â™s locked down twenty-three hours a day and even when they go out, like if they have like a little bit of time outside, you know theyÃ¢Â€Â™re like in another cage Ã¢Â€Â” even with that, word will spread in a segregation unit about the comic books and IÃ¢Â€Â™ll hear from the next guy over in a segregation unit. But that isnÃ¢Â€Â™t true about women. And I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know the reasons. I mean, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know whether there is a lot more shame Ã¢Â€Â” I mean thatÃ¢Â€Â™s one of the things, I think a lot more shame Ã¢Â€Â” a lot more stigma, a lot more mental illness, you know? Just a lot more things keeping women from being more outward when theyÃ¢Â€Â™re incarcerated. I mean, the incidence of mental illness is huge in prisons Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, itÃ¢Â€Â™s huge anyway Ã¢Â€Â” but itÃ¢Â€Â™s huge in jails. I just read this statistic that seventy-five percent of women in jails have diagnosable mental illness. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€Â” thatÃ¢Â€Â™s an intense number. You know, and more than sixty percent have been victims of child abuse and sexual abuse. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s this huge correlation between injection drug use and sexual abuse. And so women, it could be Ã¢Â€Â” are dealing with completely untreated in these prisons Ã¢Â€Â“ completely untreated Ã¢Â€Â” dealing with a kind of, a set of issues that the men arenÃ¢Â€Â™t dealing with. They almost all have kids and theyÃ¢Â€Â™re completely Ã¢Â€Â” when I say that these prisons are in the boondocks of the boondocks, there are women who are in prison that go for years without seeing their kids and lose custody of their kids. And are dealing with that, you know, that sadness and that shame. And so I think that there are all of these kinds of reasons that are very complex about why I think I donÃ¢Â€Â™t hear from more women. I guess my being a feminist is the thing that allows me to want to think about this. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s still Ã¢Â€Â” I still donÃ¢Â€Â™t have any way of actually reaching out to them in ways that Ã¢Â€Â” you know, in more ways. One things is that when I have, when we have these three comic books, one is on women, one is on the war on drugs, one is on the financing inside of prisons, and IÃ¢Â€Â” when people request the comic books, when men request the comic books, I always send them all three comic books, including the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s one because I want them Ã¢Â€Â” people say Ã¢Â€ÂœWell why do you, why are you sending the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s one to men?Ã¢Â€Â You know, I want them to know about the experience of women. Which, I feel like is good for them and anybody else to know. TUCKER: You mentioned that you think that the prison is intentionally racist, and do you feel like itÃ¢Â€Â™s also intentionally misogynist? AHRENS: Oh, I mean, itÃ¢Â€Â™s a horrible, horrible, itÃ¢Â€Â™s an inhumane system. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s an inhumane system, it is Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, if you go to a prison anywhere. Maybe not in New York City, like if you go to Ritgers Island jail, if you go Ã¢Â€Â” because all of these prisons are in Ã¢Â€Â” no matter what state theyÃ¢Â€Â™re in because of policing, because of racist policing, because of driving while black, because of walking down the street while black, because of the kinds of sentencing that goes on, because the system itself is racist, because people who are poor and donÃ¢Â€Â™t have access to decent lawyers canÃ¢Â€Â™t opt about of the criminal justice system the way rich people can Ã¢Â€Â” especially the way rich white people can, or even the middle class, there are many, many, many Ã¢Â€Â” there are a million African-American men in prison. A million. If you walk into any prison, no matter where you go, in the Whitest of White states, if you go up to Vermont, and you walk into a prison, youÃ¢Â€Â™ll see Black people. And who will you see guarding them? White people. And there is no prison, except maybe, like Ritgers Island, or you know some city Ã¢Â€Â” some big city jail. Maybe in Los Angeles city jails, where the, where maybe a lot of the guards a Latino, you know, maybe, but if you go into actual prisons, what you see is White people keeping Black people or people of color in cages. That is what you see and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what goes on. And so the degradation, the Ã¢Â€Â” just everyday shame the huge, huge, huge discrepancy of power. Power, I mean in the most gross form, goes on every single minute of the day. Every single minute of the day. And these are by and large white people that are rural white people that have absolutely no experience with people of color and especially black people, other than being their Ã¢Â€Â“ locking them in cages, so to say that itÃ¢Â€Â™s, I mean itÃ¢Â€Â™s racism cranked up times, I mean, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know what, you know what I mean? The only equivalent would be like slavery. But even possibly in slavery there was more humanity between people, depending on the kind of situations, you know what I mean Ã¢Â€Â” if it was two slaves and one master Ã¢Â€Â” well this is one master and thousands of slaves, always. So, if you take that and you take that dynamic and then on top of that, you put women and male guards watching them doing everything that you can imagine, and the kind of sexual abuse and the kind of intimidation that goes on, I mean it is horrific. I mean, which is why, which is maybe another reason Ã¢Â€Â” but I guess maybe not because, people donÃ¢Â€Â™t even know Ã¢Â€Â” why people donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to think about it, because it is so horrific. So, it is fraught, every aspect of the system is fraught with power, and racism and misogyny and degrading people. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s their job Ã¢Â€Â” they see it as their job to degrade people. And, I mean the inhumanity.

HENRY: Well, my mom and dad had their children all close together. So we all spent most of our years all in the house together. We were raised in a tiny little home, two brothers and a sister and, although when we were young, having all of us close together was very, very hard on my mother. She, and I, suffered as a result, because she just had too much to deal with when she had all these kids. It was too much. The isolation was too much for somebody who had been raised in the city and already had a profession before she met my dad. But at the same time, my parents were really good about paying attention to things that their kids needed, sort of the basic maintenance things, like we had a really good meals cooked. My mom cooked, or when I grew up, I helped her cook a really good meal and put it on the table every night and everybody sat down at six oÃ¢Â€Â™clock and talked about their day and ate a really good meal together. That sense of social cohesion Ã¢Â€Â” I never would have used these words back then because we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t understand the concepts Ã¢Â€Â” but compared to how loose people are now around their eating time, and all that, and family structure, I am really grateful for that because it really is important to me, even to this day, when my family gets together Ã¢Â€Â” all the different members getting together around the dinner table. It doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t matter how big the table turns out to be, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s a really important part of what holds up together as a family. There can be all different wonderful things that holds families together, but this thing in my life I really appreciate, because itÃ¢Â€Â™s a combination of caring about feeding people really well, people caring about eating well together, and just the kind of combination Ã¢Â€Â” easygoing banter that can happen around the dinner table, which is what happened in our family. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t a harsh thing. You know, sometimes around the dinner table, things can get kind of harsh, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t like that in my family. It was really Ã¢Â€Â” it was good. At the same time, you know, a lot of my adult work in recent years has been about preventing child sexual abuse, so I went through that whole period of time in my teenage years from the age of 12 to 16, when my father, you know, sexually abused me. So that was a tortuous period for me. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t talk about it and, personally, for me, those years Ã¢Â€Â” I had a very happy exterior which I tried to maintain as best I could and I had a tortuous interior
life. The split between those two things Ã¢Â€Â” there will always be some kind of pulling together that I have to do around that. IÃ¢Â€Â™m sure weÃ¢Â€Â™ll talk probably a little bit more about [the abuse], but the overall family life in which my siblings and I were embedded, in the environment my parents worked to create, was a good family life. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s part of what has made me care about prevention, and to want to do whatever we can to pay attention to prevention so that these kinds of families arenÃ¢Â€Â™t torn apart by a sexual abuse thing happening, which is what would happen in todayÃ¢Â€Â™s world if that happened to me and IÃ¢Â€Â™d told about it. So, I had good memories, lots of good memories about my family life.

In a way, as I got to be a teenager more Ã¢Â€Â” aside from all the child sexual abuse, which is a story in itself Ã¢Â€Â” I could see that some parents of my friends didnÃ¢Â€Â™t seem to care much about what their kids did, and I began to value the fact that my parents cared about what we did.

WEIGAND: How about race issues within feminism? Did they emerge during this Massachusetts Commission? HENRY: Um, not that I recall. But, um, I just Ã¢Â€Â” I was looking through my papers and I saw that I had published a poem about child sexual abuse back then and I want to look at when that was published, because I thought it was published when I was in Washington and if it was, then I Ã¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t believe we addressed rape. WEIGAND: Actually, I said race. HENRY: Oh, race. IÃ¢Â€Â™m sorry. WEIGAND: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s OK. HENRY: IÃ¢Â€Â™m sorry. WEIGAND: Rape is another interesting question. HENRY: Well, yeah, I was just trying to remember, you know, when we started dealing with that issue, and I think it was within National WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Commission

s just a different political process in 2004. They would be considered very, very liberal in todayÃ¢Â€Â™s terms. WEIGAND: On the feminist side of it, disregarding the whole Eagle Forum group, what were some of the kind of divisive issues that came up? HENRY: Well, there were quite a few, actually. What was not divisive was everything right in the middle: equal education, equal pay, childcare Ã¢Â€Â”you know, basic civil rights. Those Ã¢Â€Â” everybody was for them, but around those issues were issues that were emerging issues. How do you deal with the issue of rape? Is child abuse a feminist issue? And there were commissioners Ã¢Â€Â” Catherine East, in fact Ã¢Â€Â” who argued against including child abuse in our national plan of action. And I made a very strong statement. One of the earliest pieces of activism I did was to work behind the scenes with Gloria Steinem to get child abuse on the agenda. I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t, in those days, use child sexual abuse because I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t able to be public about what had happened to me, but thatÃ¢Â€Â™s why I did it. We put it under the whole rubric of child abuse, and Gloria made a wonderful argument, you know, that child abuse affects girls disproportionately Ã¢Â€Â” involves women. You know, we need to have child abuse as part of this national plan of action, and she was successful in arguing for that. The issue of prostitution was contentious. There was a whole group of women way out in the spectrum, a whole group of women arguing that we shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have any laws against prostitution. We call it Ã¢Â€Âœworking in the sex tradeÃ¢Â€Â now. At the time we called it prostitution. Um, but you know, there were people arguing that we should abandon all the laws and legalize prostitution, and then there were people arguing we shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have anything connected to prostitution as part of this national plan of action, one way or the other.

 WEIGAND: And how about Bella Abzug: did you have much interaction with her? HENRY: I did. And Bella was a complicated person for me personally because I Ã¢Â€Â” I found myself, in the middle of the IWY process, having quite a number of dreams about Bella Abzug setting up circumstances that I would get raped in. It was very extreme. And it was because Bella had this incredible personality which was aggressive. I mean her name, Bella, fit Bella most perfectly. She wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t full of hatred or anything, but she just threw off her energy any time she wanted, anytime she vented toward anybody. If she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t like what was going on and you happened to be standing in front of her, she would scream and yell at you, which she did to me at these state meetings, especially the New York meeting. There were a lot of people around her who loved her 
nd protected her and didnÃ¢Â€Â™t like to see that part of her, but I just saw it really clearly, and I experienced it really clearly, and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t like it one bit. And I dreamt at night about it, in a way, because I had been raised in that circumstance where IÃ¢Â€Â™d been harmed by somebody who had just had power over me. So really, it really took a toll on me. And she did a couple of things that probably werenÃ¢Â€Â™t that big of a deal to some people, but they were a really big deal to me. Like at the national womenÃ¢Â€Â™s conference, when we were thanking everybody at the end, because it was a huge undertaking to have this conference, and she called a few of us up to the stage to have us recognized, and I was one of those people, but she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t call everybody, and everybody had worked just as hard, and I was so upset by that. And in a subsequent meeting in the staff, I remember standing, when Bella was talking with all of us and thanking us privately in our offices, in Washington Ã¢Â€Â” I remember that my knees were shaking, literally, and I was standing behind a chair, so nobody could see how my knees were shaking, and I confronted Bella, and I said, you know, Ã¢Â€ÂœThere were certain things you did that were really wrong from my point of view, and this is one of them, this is another one.Ã¢Â€Â I named them and, you know, I was so frightened to do that, because she was just the kind of person who would attack you if she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t like what she heard. And in that kind of setting Ã¢Â€Â” thatÃ¢Â€Â™s another thing I learned, is that she wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t feeling any fear at that time, or feeling any anxiety Ã¢Â€Â” so she simply could hear it. That wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t the trigger for her. It was when she was upset that she got triggered and got angry. So in that situation, we were all standing around, all of us, you know, 30 or 50 people as a staff, standing around and being thanked by Bella. And she heard what I said and basically took her hat off, which she never did, and just asked people to say a little bit more about that and then she apologized and said, you know, something really nice about how much all of us had done to accomplish IWY. I mean, again, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a really personal story that maybe isnÃ¢Â€Â™t so relevant for the big picture, but it was really relevant to me, because she had tortured me with those dreams. The way she was had tortured me, and I, for my own sake, had to stand up and come back at that.

Yeah, I was really pleased with it, and I was pleased personally to have seen all the state meetings address the issue of child abuse, even though at the time, in my experience, I thought, maybe thatÃ¢Â€Â™s as much activism as IÃ¢Â€Â™ll ever do on that.

but I had this precious time in my thirties. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s not as if all of this was in foresight, but the part of it that was in foresight is that I needed some time in my thirties to just become a more whole person than I felt myself to be. And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what I ended up doing with that period of time in my life, which, when I was living through it, felt like IÃ¢Â€Â™m going nowhere, IÃ¢Â€Â™m confused, IÃ¢Â€Â™m not doing good enough things in the world. Maybe part of that was just having spent my twenties in such an intensive political environment and then having an intensive graduate program. I sort of cut a standard for myself, or had some experience that I was trying to keep active. But actually, that time was really, really fertile time, because I did sort of step off the career ascendancy. I spent some time in group therapy. I spent some time in personal therapy. I got myself much more healed as a person, understanding who I was inside. All the things I felt I needed to be able to voice those abuse experiences in a safe environment and heal from them. It needed some attention.
It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t something that I was going to ignore. So I had a consulting practice. It was successful enough, and my partnership, the person that I was in partnership with and I ended up doing a very large piece of work for the National Academy of Sciences, which took us traveling all across the world. We worked in maybe 25 or 30 developing countries in all continents, and you know, we did some wonderful work for the National Academy. It also gave me an experience of the rest of the world and how poor so many people are, how much they struggle. It helped develop my sense of humility around being an American and seeing our power and privilege and how important it is not to abuse that power or privilege Ã¢Â€Â” which we have not lived up to. Which, you know, at that time, it just Ã¢Â€Â” you know, I saw first hand that the importance of paying attention to whatÃ¢Â€Â™s happening in the rest of the world. And so, in the midst of having time to become this more whole person that I wanted to become, I also had a lot of really amazing work experiences that have stayed with me. One of my mentors once said that every single thing that happens to us is relevant for every single thing that happens later. For example, you donÃ¢Â€Â™t know why you meet this or that person, or why you have that conversation or why you read that book, or why you do Ã¢Â€Â” but sometime later in your life, those things will come back to have a part of what you need for the next step ahead of you. I feel like that time, in my thirties, was very much that. I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t understand all of what was going on inside of me or around me, but it was a very fertile time for what came later. At the end of that time, at the end of my thirties, I was sort of coming into my own much more. How do I say that? Because I came into my own before that, but I was in my own sort of, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know. In my twenties and thirties I felt like I had a lot to prove to the outside world and a lot of skills to develop inside of me and a lot of things to put out there in the world, and by the end of my thirties, I had done some of those things and I was more, like, OK, am I really living up to my full potential as a person? And I went through a couple of years of really not knowing. I really liked working for my clients. I liked what I was doing, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t as much as I could give back to the world. So what is that thing? And I realized that I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to be in the private sector as much as I wanted to do something in social change and activism. I realized that that work that IÃ¢Â€Â™d done in the twenties Ã¢Â€Â” some of that feeling that you have when youÃ¢Â€Â™re doing those kinds of things, that was still available to me. It took about three years to sort through all of what it might be. And then, it started to dawn on me that what I really wanted to do was something organizing to prevent child sexual abuse. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know what it was Ã¢Â€Â” two, three, four years, something in there Ã¢Â€Â” it took a long time for all the pieces to be in place, for me to realize that. But then, I did. It just Ã¢Â€Â” I had one of those clicks, like, Well, I really care about that issue. I really know something about that issue. I really have a point of view on that issue. You know, why donÃ¢Â€Â™t I just do something on it? ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the way I work. It just sort of dawned on me. And then, the way these things also work is at the same time, I had met a really fine man and we decided to get married. We got engaged. And right at the time we were getting engaged, maybe the same month or so, I just had the realization at the very same time that I wanted to form this organization to prevent child sexual abuse. At the time, I understood that the reason that I was ready to do some activist work on child sexual abuse at that moment was that I, by then, had met many people. One of the reasons I was doing this is that it came out of that experience as a teenager thinking I was the only person in the entire world to whom that happened. And then so many people, because it was something I never forgot and I talked about it Ã¢Â€Â” not a lot, but enough that people knew about it Ã¢Â€Â” so many people told me about their own experiences. It just totally freaked me out. And I realized, This is never going to stop unless people who had the experience do something about it, speak up about it. And I had that whole experience about the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement about speaking up, you know, organizing for change. But I also knew that because it was so painful and had harmed me so much that it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t something I was going to easily be able to do to begin with. I knew I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t able to do that without being in a solid relationship with somebody else who provided some levity to the psychic pain that it was going to cause me to organize. And at the time, I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have put these words on it, but I know exactly that was what was happening, because I was aware that something that was so painful, that had happened to so many people, that had gone on for so many millennia Ã¢Â€Â” why hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t we changed it? There were very few survivor activists out there making something happen in prevention. Not just surviving and helping other people heal from it, and having speak-outs, but also organizing to prevent it. So I thought, now, if that hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t happened and Fran, you think you can contribute something to that, I mean, letÃ¢Â€Â™s pay attention to why that hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t happened. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s because itÃ¢Â€Â™s a really hard thing to do. And you canÃ¢Â€Â™t just pretend as if you could go off and do that, as if you were, you know, baking cakes for a cake sale, for a fundraiser. You know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like you could be into psychic overload, and the thing that would bring the levity into that is to be in a good relationship with somebody else who would take my mind off it when I was in relationship to that person and just provide a whole different kind of balance in my life. So right at the same time we got engaged I thought about starting the organization. Just at that very same time, the way these things work out, just two months before, Anita Hill had, you know, argued before the hearings that Clarence Thomas shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be appointed to the Supreme Court and why. And I found myself that fall, so it was probably Ã¢Â€Â” I bet you have these dates right, it was probably October or November of 1991 that Anita Hill was testifying before Congress. And I listened to every moment of those hearings that I could, which is not that common for me to listen to that much media, but I did. I listened. I was totally fascinated by Anita Hill doing what she was doing. And I can remember in December, just a few months later, when I said, IÃ¢Â€Â™m gonna start an organization. This is what itÃ¢Â€Â™s going to be about. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s going to prevent child sexual abuse and going to focus on prevention. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s going to use tools of public health Ã¢Â€Â” because I thought about things that I had been aware of in my lifetime, especially the issue of drunk driving that had been so common in the 1960s and IÃ¢Â€Â™d lost friends to, and about how people learn to pay attention to it as a behavior that can be changed. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re going to learn how to apply those kinds of tools of public health to this issue, and that weÃ¢Â€Â™re going involve people who were perpetrators in the solution to it, because it canÃ¢Â€Â™t be another thing that women have to organize all by themselves, as if men werenÃ¢Â€Â™t part of the problem. So I had to figure out a way to bring the people who were most needing to change here into the solution. And just as I was putting all those principles together, I remember sitting, you know, quietly one morning and saying, Ã¢Â€ÂœAnd I donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to name this organization something thatÃ¢Â€Â™s like a Washington-type name, that would be the National Center for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse. SomebodyÃ¢Â€Â™s gonna make some sort of acronym with it, and then, forever, itÃ¢Â€Â™s gonna be A,B,C, you know.Ã¢Â€Â I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI want it to have a name thatÃ¢Â€Â™s an activist name that has a lot of life in it.Ã¢Â€Â And immediately, I saw Anita Hill in my head, and Anita Hill was answering, I think it was Senator Arlen SpecterÃ¢Â€Â™s question Ã¢Â€Â” or was it Orrin Hatch? Orrin Hatch or Arlen Specter was asking, Ã¢Â€ÂœSo if this happened to you all that time ago, you know, why didnÃ¢Â€Â™t you say something? Why didnÃ¢Â€Â™t you do something then? Why are you coming forward now?Ã¢Â€Â And she said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI just wanted it to stop. And that wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t my goal to seek any kind of revenge or change. I just wanted it to stop.Ã¢Â€Â And I just had this click. Sometimes we have clicks, and it was click, click, click. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s what we want. So many of us have been through this. We donÃ¢Â€Â™t necessarily want to wreak havoc and revenge on the people who perpetrated against us. We might, but so many of the times, we just wanted it to stop. We wanted it, you know, our brother, our uncle, our dad, our grandfather, our, you know, whoever, teacher, to go back to the way they were before they abused us and start again. You know, we wanted it to stop. So then, Stop It Now! Ã¢Â€Â” the name just came to me like that. And as soon as I realized it was Stop It Now! then I realized the acronym to that is SIN. And I said, this is going to be terrible, so I know from a marketing point of view, every single time somebody uses the word SIN as an acronym for Stop It Now, I have to politely correct them, which, for 14 years, I did. And now, itÃ¢Â€Â™s Stop It Now. The way American Cancer Society is known as American Cancer Society and just taught everybody consistently, just correct people politely. And so, lo and behold, we have the name Stop It Now! And then, at the same time, when somebody says, Ã¢Â€ÂœDo you realize it means sin?Ã¢Â€Â I say, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, if thereÃ¢Â€Â™s anything thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a sin in the culture of our country, it would be child sexual abuse. So letÃ¢Â€Â™s just leave that standing. But the name of the organization is Stop It Now!Ã¢Â€Â So, anyway, it was so wonderful to be able to name it simply, to have the concept for it come out of that, that incredible answer that she gave when she was put under that pressure, that kind of pressure that so many women are put under. And certainly, boys have dealt with it. But you know, that whole thing of somehow, youÃ¢Â€Â™re to blame if you didnÃ¢Â€Â™t correct that wrong when that happened. You, who are the victim of something, somehow, you affronted society by not correcting it when it happened, when you were at your most victimized and powerless state. So, anyway, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s just a little bit of a window into that transition from that confusing time and coming out of my thirties time and making-myself-whole time into something where I was ready for activism again.

I wrote a letter to 20 of my friends or so, and I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m working all by myself.Ã¢Â€Â This must have been in 1993. Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m working all by myself. This is really hard material to deal with. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s got the best of me sometimes. So if you would just call me, rather than me have to reach out to you, and tell you how awful this is to discover every single day somebody new whoÃ¢Â€Â™s been sexually abused, would you please call me a couple of times. Sign up for a certain week, and then call me a couple of times and just say something cheery like, Ã¢Â€Â˜HowÃ¢Â€Â™re you doing? I just think youÃ¢Â€Â™re great.Ã¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â And I got 20 of my friends to sign up for a whole week. It took a half a year of my life, in 1993, each week somebody different signed up. And of the 20 friends, like, almost everybody remembered their week and called me two or three times and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, I just think youÃ¢Â€Â™re terrific.Ã¢Â€Â (laughter) And it was such a good reminder that, you know, we need support and we canÃ¢Â€Â™t always get it in the way that we need it but we can organize for what we really need. And anyway, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if thatÃ¢Â€Â™s relevant to anything except that itÃ¢Â€Â™s good to know that trying to organize difficult things that arenÃ¢Â€Â™t entirely clear to you except long after in hindsight Ã¢Â€Â” you know, that when youÃ¢Â€Â™re actually going through at the beginning it takes a lot of perseverance, and it is difficult and you canÃ¢Â€Â™t know all the answers, but you can do things to take care of yourself and help yourself, you know, have the energy and stamina to withstand all the negativity, skepticism and negativity youÃ¢Â€Â™re going to naturally get at the beginning.

WEIGAND: Right, right. Well, I was going to ask what kind of reaction you had from other parts of the anti-violence movement, if you can talk about such a thing. What kind of responses you got from the larger world to Stop It Now! once you started putting it out there. HENRY: Yeah. Well, actually, your questions are really great ones because it was when I first organized Stop It Now!, I thought the people who would most be likely to support and want to work on Stop It Now!Ã¢Â€Â™s behalf would be feminists and survivors. I went to those communities in various forms to vet the idea and, you know, garner their support and I was met with incredibly consistent skepticism and sometimes real, just total dislike of what I was doing. One story is one that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve told in some different settings with Stop It Now! You might see it in the papers somewhere, but probably itÃ¢Â€Â™s before Stop It Now! Ã¢Â€Â” and, you know, early 1992. By 1994 we were out there in various public settings, especially in Vermont, and there was a conference of survivors of child sexual abuse in Vermont back in, probably, late 1993 or early 1994. And it was a conference Ã¢Â€Â” again, I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t believe that 400 peopl
 are at this conference. It was, like, there shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be even one of us at this conference, and thereÃ¢Â€Â™s 400 of us at this conference. Anyway, so I was holding a workshop on preventing child sexual abuse and talking about these ideas of reaching the abusers before they abuse and dealing with it from a public health point of view and everything. I had this whole description in the conference brochure and there were 400 women at this conference. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember any men there but maybe there were a few. But anyway, it was a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s conference. And not a single person came to my workshop. Not a single person. And I sat there at the beginning of the workshop in my little room, and I just decided, IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to sit here for two hours and IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to think about this, think about having a conference of 400 survivors and not a single person has come to my workshop. And IÃ¢Â€Â™m gonna think about what that means. And I did. And you know, I decided Ã¢Â€Â” and that was one of the things during that time when I was saying that I had this dream and you know, I was really needing support from my friends. It was like I had to think about, can I do something thatÃ¢Â€Â™s valuable to this issue if I donÃ¢Â€Â™t have my feminist sisters around me? I had to really do a lot of soul searching to be willing to take the idea forward. And I actually Ã¢Â€Â” thatÃ¢Â€Â™s when I came back to that principle that Wilma Scott Heide had laid down for me and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI just have to trust that this issue is so painful and so difficult for people that people have to enter it from all different points of view, and it may take a long time before somebody is willing to engage in prevention at the level that IÃ¢Â€Â™m trying to get this dialogue going.Ã¢Â€Â And I realized at the time that I had an incredible advantage, as difficult as the abuse was, I had an incredible advantage, because every time that I went back and confronted my Ã¢Â€Â” Well, first of all, I never forgot that the abuse happened between the age of 12 and 16, that it was my father that abused me. I was never confused about that. And that every time I went back and talked to my dad, he admitted that he did it and he apologized and extended whatever understanding he could with himself, toward me at the time and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhatever Ã¢Â€Â” if you need to come back and talk to me about this again, please do.Ã¢Â€Â I confronted him once when I came back from college. I confronted him another two or three times, in my twenties and thirties, and each time with my mother present and, you know, as limited as my family had understanding of these psychological things, my dad really stepped up to the plate and took responsibility for what he did and did not put it back on me. And I realized, as I was sitting in that workshop, thinking about this, I thought, so many peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s stories about hurt have been about being dismissed, being denied, being lied to, being lied to about something so hurtful, so powerful, and then I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t really expect people to automatically come around and think abusers are going to take responsibility for this just because I had this particular experience with the person who abused me. But I also had to trust that he wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t the only person out there whoÃ¢Â€Â™s abusing who wanted to take responsibility or was capable of it, and that somehow, it was such a complex issue that part of the solution we were talking about with prevention had to fathom that, had to wrestle with that. And then I was sort of stuck in this place of wrestling with it and realizing that I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t expect support from people who just werenÃ¢Â€Â™t there yet. And then, again, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the time that I asked for this dream, and got sort of psychic support around that. At the very same time, I was invited to give a talk to the coalition Ã¢Â€Â” the Domestic and Sexual Violence Coalition, all the organizations in the state of Vermont who were organizing against rape and against domestic violence. They had an annual conference and they had me give a speech. Again, it was early, it was 1993 or 1994, or maybe it was 1995, but it was right in there, and I gave my talk about Stop It Now!, what weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing and the program weÃ¢Â€Â™re starting in Vermont. People were so cold. That wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t individuals not coming to a workshop who were survivors. This was organized people working professionally in the feminist community. And I mean, they were so cold. At that meeting, I gave this talk and then I just literally had to go to the bathroom and throw up, I was so Ã¢Â€Â” I was so moved by how cold everybody was, moved in a negative way, just so Ã¢Â€Â” ah, chilled me to the bone. It made me sick. That was just the other Ã¢Â€Â” that was like I just had to go forward, understanding that thatÃ¢Â€Â™s where people were. That they hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t had the experience that I had and that I just had to trust that the experience that I had had was valid. I realized that even if it was ahead of its time, then we had to slow it down and make it part of its time, which we did the best we could. And over the years there are still people now who are very much opposed to some of the principles that Stop It Now! supports, about bringing abusers into the solution and making them part of figuring out how to solve this thing. But here are also a lot of people who are working professionally Ã¢Â€Â” feminists who are working professionally against domestic violence and against sexual violence Ã¢Â€Â” who want to find ways to reach out to perpetrators whether they be male or female. So thatÃ¢Â€Â™s also the nature of social change. You canÃ¢Â€Â™t Ã¢Â€Â” even on this issue that had hurt me so much personally and so much Ã¢Â€Â” I had to deal with it on a personal level every day. I also have to realize that itÃ¢Â€Â™s a big world out there and it takes a lot of different kinds of solutions to solve something thatÃ¢Â€Â™s as pervasive as child sexual abuse. And it takes a lot of different points of view and a lot of different kind of dialogue to move something forward. And maybe even that experience that I had at IWY of just seeing really nasty, thorny, difficult things be sorted through, I just realize, Well, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s part of the nature of social change, and I have to do my best not to take it too personally. WEIGAND: So, you feel like in your years that you were part of Stop It Now! more people did come around to understanding or supporting your point of view? HENRY: Yeah, lots and lots and lots of people have. I think we can get sort of hooked up on trying to make people who are really dead set against you agree with you, and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s not the way to get social change to happen. I think itÃ¢Â€Â™s too Ã¢Â€Â” if itÃ¢Â€Â™s a good, solid healthy, whole idea, then you just look for the support where you can find it and build from it. And if itÃ¢Â€Â™s a really a true solution that has something to offer society, itÃ¢Â€Â™s either gonna come through it and stand on its own two feet at some point, or itÃ¢Â€Â™s gonna be blown off the face of the universe because itÃ¢Â€Â™s really not a valid idea. So, yes, other people did. Especially people who were in the criminal justice system, or people who were in the system of treating sex offenders and they saw these people come to places of great social change inside themselves, great individual change inside themselves. And people in the public health system that saw all the capacity of public health to contribute to the issue. Yeah, lots of people came around. And lots of people who were feminists came around, too. At least, if they were very skeptical at the beginning, they said, IÃ¢Â€Â™m skeptical and I can tell you that, but IÃ¢Â€Â™m not gonna organize against it, IÃ¢Â€Â™m just gonna be skeptical over here and watch and see what happens. And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s OK. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s good enough. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s fair enough. WEIGAND: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s interesting, the way you just put it makes me think about some of that stuff about in feminism, the personal is political. By hoping to change people individually, or, you know, making them come to terms with what theyÃ¢Â€Â™ve done individually and tried to figure out how to stop doing it, youÃ¢Â€Â™re really helping to create a large-scale change. I was wondering, you know, because of NancyÃ¢Â€Â™s work and talking with her about this stuff, I was wondering about whether this whole bunch of people who are Ã¢Â€Â” well, I canÃ¢Â€Â™t even remember when this happened but there was this whole sort of public discourse that challenged the whole idea of recovered memory Ã¢Â€Â” HENRY: Oh, yeah, the false memory syndrome. WEIGAND: Yeah. What kind of interaction has Stop It Now! had with them? I mean, have they latched onto particular people to rail against, orÃ¢Â€Â” HENRY: Yeah. Well, we actually have never had any direct dealings with people from False Memory Syndrome Foundation, who are the people who support that. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t really even know how vague any of that is. It was just more, I think something that had some reality to it and then the media took a hold of it? It was sort of like that myth got started back in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement that women burned their bras, when that was just Ã¢Â€Â” what an incredibly bizarre metaphor. And the media just loved that because it had some juice to it, and I think there was some juice to this metaphor of these women claiming these things happened all those years ago and then people being harmed by the accusations. But because we were dealing in prevention, there were a lot of survivors that didnÃ¢Â€Â™t easily come forward and deal with us directly. Those are the people that the False Memory Syndrome Foundation was dealing with. And because we were going into prisons and treatment programs where men were saying, I did this terrible thing Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, it was like the opposite of false memory syndrome. What are they gonna say to that, you know? Somebody has tricked you into saying that? What a terrible thing Ã¢Â€Â” being falsely convicted. Anyway, because we were dealing with that side of it, whenever I was dealing with those questions from the media Ã¢Â€Â” and that especially happened in the early 1990s when youÃ¢Â€Â™d get journalistÃ¢Â€Â™s questions from that point of view all the time Ã¢Â€Â” and I would just say I donÃ¢Â€Â™t have much to say about that. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re dealing with people who have admitted it and theyÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to figure out what couldÃ¢Â€Â™ve happened in their lives to prevent it, because it destroyed their life, you know, so I canÃ¢Â€Â™t go there and have that conversation with you. You know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s just not a relevant conversation. WEIGAND: OK. HENRY: I would always say, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou know what? IÃ¢Â€Â™m sure there are a few people in this country whoÃ¢Â€Â™ve been falsely accused, and IÃ¢Â€Â™m sure there are some parents who have abused children and want to deny it or have actually forgotten it for some reason or another. But I can tell you that I know an awful lot of people who come up to me after a workshop or a speech and they whisper in my ear and say, IÃ¢Â€Â™ve never said this to anybody but having heard you speak, IÃ¢Â€Â™m gonna tell you that I was sexually abused and I just want you to know that. And I said [to the journalist], Ã¢Â€ÂœEvery single person whoÃ¢Â€Â™s done that with me, you know, I look at them in the eye and I say, Ã¢Â€Â˜I am so sorry that happened to you.Ã¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â And my heart is breaking for that experience because I know exactly what they went through. And I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhere do those people fit into false memory syndrome? TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re not telling anybody. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re not Ã¢Â€Â” theyÃ¢Â€Â™re hardly telling me, you know? ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the truth of my experience in dealing with this issue.Ã¢Â€Â And so then the journalist would go off and ask me other questions after that, because what do you say? ItÃ¢Â€Â™s the most profound phenomenal issue, really, child sexual abuse. It hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t even begun to be dealt with in any kind of straightforward way in our culture. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re just Ã¢Â€Â” even Stop It Now!, with all of its hard work and everything and all of the people who have been doing the wonderful healing work around survivors, weÃ¢Â€Â™re really just scratching the tiniest little surface on 
t. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s so profound. WEIGAND: It seems like in a way, somebody almost had to have your kind of background to start an organization like that. I mean, do you think thatÃ¢Â€Â™s true, somebody who Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, you sort of straddle this position of having your own business, having all this experience with social change stuff. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t even know what IÃ¢Â€Â™m asking, exactly. HENRY: Well, youÃ¢Â€Â™re asking me what I thought. Like, in my late thirties, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s exactly what I thought. When I thought about the issue I cared about the most, and I cared the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement and feminism when I was in my twenties, but I actually hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t experienced that much discrimination, that I was aware of, anyway, as a woman. The worst thing that had happened to me in my life was around this child sexual abuse and I thought, if IÃ¢Â€Â™m gonna spend my time organizing, how many other people who went through that have this combination of skills and experience, and spent this time in Washington? I understand things from a national perspective. How many people are just willing to do this. It just Ã¢Â€Â” it was like a real call there, like, Fran, no matter what you were planning to do with your life, you have kind of a responsibility to do this. And so, I really answered that at that level, and it was exactly that. And I hope I can say that, with exactly the right feeling I have for it. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot of humbleness around how big of a problem it is and how small a person I was compared to how big the problem was. But itÃ¢Â€Â™s also from having sort of cut my professional teeth working with other women who were becoming themselves in the world and taking their ideas seriously. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like, if I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t take my own ideas seriously and do something about it and sort of step up Ã¢Â€Â” it was time for me to step to the plate. If I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t do that, then I Ã¢Â€Â” itÃ¢Â€Â™s like I felt like I had failed the people who went before me to make me have a chance to have those opportunities, to have that, you know, business experience and to have all that exposure that I have. And so, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to be, like, coming from somewhere else. I wanted to be myself, which has a bit of sort of the reluctant leader to it, but I also didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to be falsely modest and say, Oh, you canÃ¢Â€Â™t do this, because I could, and I should if I could Ã¢Â€Â” I should. So, I think your question is really relevant. I mean, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if itÃ¢Â€Â™s relevant to the people who are watching this tape at the moment that theyÃ¢Â€Â™re watching it, if that matters to them, but it mattered to me at that moment. WEIGAND: So, do you feel this has sort of helped your process of becoming a whole person, as you put it? HENRY: Oh, my goodness, it really, really has. Yes, and I actually think some of the most important work that I have to do Ã¢Â€Â” and some of it really is ahead of me, based on everything else IÃ¢Â€Â™ve done. But to take something that caused so much personal pain Ã¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t really talk about the personal side of it that much anyplace, and IÃ¢Â€Â™m not in this tape because itÃ¢Â€Â™s something thatÃ¢Â€Â™s intensely private and I think it should remain private. You know, maybe as I think about it more and I have more decades on it, IÃ¢Â€Â™ll have some more things to say about it, but I just experience such intense pain. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s still Ã¢Â€Â” it has cost me a huge amount. Now, IÃ¢Â€Â™ve done some public speaking about this, how it just kept me from having an intimate relationship thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a long-lasting one, kept me from being in a situation where I could have children, which is a crime to not be able to be in a stable enough situation to have children, if you really want children in your life. So this issue has really cost me and IÃ¢Â€Â™ve suffered a lot with it. And you know, I married somebody who was a beautiful, beautiful man but who had a very difficult childhood and he had a lot, a lot of difficulty and my husband committed suicide in 1997. And he didnÃ¢Â€Â™t speak about it to anybody at all, but he had a history of child sexual abuse. And to work in Stop It Now! daily, and be married to somebody who ends up taking his life in the middle of your marriage Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, this profound psychic pain, I mean, just Ã¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to really go into it, because itÃ¢Â€Â™s just too painful. But those of us who have been through those experiences, I think, if we have the capacity to do some work around it, then itÃ¢Â€Â™s our responsibility. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s our calling to do some organizing around it and do whatever we can to help the people who come after us so that they donÃ¢Â€Â™t have to live with that kind of pain. So, IÃ¢Â€Â™ve actually lost track of your question, which I havenÃ¢Â€Â™t done too many times but itÃ¢Â€Â™s just like, itÃ¢Â€Â™s a very difficult thing.

ANDERSON: So, let me just ask one question about thatÃ¢Â€Â” HOLLIBAUGH: Yep. ANDERSON: Ã¢Â€Â”and then weÃ¢Â€Â™ll go back to your, your dadÃ¢Â€Â™s family. You say your mom was active in the battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, and yet your mom was also the perpetrator of violence in your home. HOLLIBAUGH: Yep. ANDERSON: So is that one of the ways that this issue got worked out betweenÃ¢Â€Â” I mean, how did your mom get to that place? How personal did it get in terms of the two of you working out forgiveness, healing, all thatÃ¢Â€Â” did it happen there? Did it happen decades later? HOLLIBAUGH: No, no, no. In fact, finally, I was cut off from my parents. I mean, my parents disowned me. You know, I always think, you know, you see these things on Oprah and all these kind of talk show places where they tell the happy-ending stories of incest survivors talking about it and their family reconciling. I wrote a review of Dorothy AllisonÃ¢Â€Â™s Bastard Out of Carolina where I was not explicit about the incest in my family, but I said that I came from a family where incest was a part of that history, and that one of the things that was never talked about is what that did to women, between women. Not just between a woman and a man, or women and men, but women and women, because you never believed a woman would have your back if you were a, you know, a victim of incest, and you werenÃ¢Â€Â™t defended by the women in your family. And somebody, I suspect in the anti-porn movement, send that Ã¢Â€ÂœWomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Review of BooksÃ¢Â€Â review to my family, and um, I got a letter from my father that said, you are no longer our daughter, and we disown you, and that was it. And they never spoke to me again. ANDERSON: So, you werenÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â”you and your mom werenÃ¢Â€Â™t talking about these very personal issues of violence and sex in your home when you were both active in a movementÃ¢Â€Â¦. HOLLIBAUGH: No. Or, we were very occasionally. My motherÃ¢Â€Â” so that was kind of the ending. But we had times when we were close and not close. My mother never believed me around the incest, and never, I think, could never afford to hear me. Because it wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve changed in a fundamental way, her relationship to my father. However that wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve worked out, she wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve had to be willing to risk it in order to believe me. I told her when I was eleven; she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t believe me then. I told her again when I was twenty, she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t believe me then, and I, you know, blah, blah, blah. But around violenceÃ¢Â€Â” my mother once said to me that the only thing she ever regretted about my childhood, of how she raised me as a kid, was that she, was so out of, so physically out of control. And that it was the one thing she felt like she really would change, if she ever could do anything differently again. That she knew she hit me a lot, she knew she really was wacky, in the way that she was out of control herself and that she really was sorry for it. So it was clearÃ¢Â€Â” and that was the end of that conversation, I mean, we never pursued beyond that. My mother was not a person that did self-criticism easily. When she would criticize herself, she was a terrible person, and then in reaction to being a terrible person, she would go to the other extreme and say, Ã¢Â€ÂœI never did anything wrong! IÃ¢Â€Â™m a good person, you canÃ¢Â€Â™t make me say IÃ¢Â€Â™m bad.Ã¢Â€Â So she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have any tools that really would help her understand herself. I mean, I always felt that that was really a tragedy for my mother, that she was never able to both see what she had done that she hated in her own life, and then could cut herself some slack. She either excuse it completely or say it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t happen, or she was the worst person in the world, and worse than anybody else and a terrible person. And if those are the two options that you can give yourself about your own history, frankly you can never, you can never really face it. BecauseÃ¢Â€Â” ANDERSON: And it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t allow you much room for you toÃ¢Â€Â” in a relationship, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s nowhere for you to go

And my father actually called and left me a message saying he would be willing to go into family counseling. My father, I think actuallyÃ¢Â€Â” I mean, my father knew what he had done, and my father, I think, was willing to look at it. But my mother was not. And I think that was because my mother would have been to blame, too. That she had not protected me and she had not defended me and she had not, she had not challenged my father. She had not done those kind of things. Which is a real differenceÃ¢Â€Â” if you look at Bastard Out of Carolina at least DorothyÃ¢Â€Â™s mom didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think she was a liar. She didnÃ¢Â€Â™t leave the guy, but she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think she was a liar. She tried to do what she could to protect her even though she was staying. My mother did not. My mother did something that I think is actually much more classic, which is that you claim the kidÃ¢Â€Â™s wrong, and then you connect and kind of identify with the other adult, and you form a unit against the kidÃ¢Â€Â™s exposure. And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s basically what my mom did. And my dad, I think, when this all exploded, was willing to really look at it. I think heÃ¢Â€Â” he and I had had many confrontations about this, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not as though I hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t said it directly to him. But as long as my mother couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t tolerate this as a conversation in the family, there was no movement that he and I could do, really. And so it, really, it stayed at a moment where there was conversation, and then, they moved. And they cut everybody off and all of that. And I just decided, you know what? The truth about incest is it already gives people who perpetuate it way more time in your life than they ever had the right to. Way more power in your life than it ever had the right to, and I, you knowÃ¢Â€Â¦ ANDERSON: You just decided to be done with it. HOLLIBAUGH: You know, if they called me, you knowÃ¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™ve tried to call them, but this is not an unpredictable or unforeseeable thing, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not as though I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know that if they ever found out they couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t respond, they wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t respond this way. It was a risk I was willing to take in order to not have a secret that protected them. This is the end result. The truth is I need to get on with my own life. And theyÃ¢Â€Â™ll come into it againÃ¢Â€Â”IÃ¢Â€Â™d be more than willing to let them come back into it if they want to negotiate that, IÃ¢Â€Â™ll pay attention to it. But IÃ¢Â€Â™m not really going to, Ã¢Â€Â”fuck this. You know, really, you could spend your entire life in some kind of conversation with parents that you never get over. Or you can actually live your own life and itÃ¢Â€Â™s too bad. And so it was a terrible, horrible year, and I was really in terrible grief. And then it was, it was like being an orphan. I mean, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like, all of us go through this when we lose our parents. There are many things weÃ¢Â€Â™ve never come to terms with, there are a lot of issues that weÃ¢Â€Â™ve never been able to talk about or ever come to an agreement about, in the way that we lived our lives as the child with an adult. And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the nature of parental and child relationships. MineÃ¢Â€Â™s not different. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s more dramatic because of how it ended, but you know, they died. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re now both dead. Um, and that was the other part of it, you know, I was very worried that I would not know that theyÃ¢Â€Â™d died because theyÃ¢Â€Â™d cut me off, and so I made Mary promise that she would tell me.

HOLLIBAUGH: No, you know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like, they actually get to have their own lives, including the decisions that theyÃ¢Â€Â™ve made. And they left everything to a woman thatÃ¢Â€Â™s about my age, who was their best friend And you know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like people in my family said, Ã¢Â€ÂœAre you going to challenge it, theyÃ¢Â€Â™ve got a house and a car and a blah blah.Ã¢Â€Â ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like, no. You know what? They made their money, they lived their lives, they get to make their choices. You know, we, we couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t sustain as a family. They chos
 to kick me out. IÃ¢Â€Â™m not going to go after their death and try and challenge their estate. Their estate is their life. I would like the pictures that, you know, came from that estate. I mean, I would like some of things that I think are mine from my own childhood, but thatÃ¢Â€Â™s all I really care about. And I got a few, and yeah, you know, not much, but I got a little bit. But, itÃ¢Â€Â™s over. You know, if, if they lived their lives, basically embedded in that bitterness, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s their lives. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not mine. I feel like, incest is a profoundly horrifying set of experiences, over time. Not just in terms of what it does to you when itÃ¢Â€Â™s going on. It has enormous impact over the course of your life. And the only thing you control as an adult coming to terms with it, is how it will, how it will intersect with the way that you understand yourself and the way that you live your own life. You cannot guarantee that you will come to terms with it in, in relation to the perpetuator or the other parent, your siblings, any of those kinds of things. None of those things are the markers that you control. The only thing that youÃ¢Â€Â” as a feministÃ¢Â€Â”really have, is the tool of understanding, trying to actually understand why something happened, and how youÃ¢Â€Â™ll live with that history. What it will or will not do to you, the choices it does or doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t influence, the way that youÃ¢Â€Â™ll be yourself as an adult around a child. All of those are in your control. Beyond that, none of the rest of it is open to a singular understanding. And, so for me, I feel like, you know, I saw it rip our family apart over time. It ultimately meant that we could not stay united as a family because it couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be resolved. I think thatÃ¢Â€Â™s quite classic. I think in fact, all those stories that arenÃ¢Â€Â™t the happy ending stories, very often end like that. With people never speaking again, people never seeing each other again. People never together agreeing on the nature of that history. And that you have to live with that. Because that, because thatÃ¢Â€Â™s not what you control. ANDERSON: Where did you find the tools? I mean, what is also classic is that the little girl grows up to perpetuate, or to, you know, all sorts of outcomes thatÃ¢Â€Â¦ HOLLIBAUGH: Or be a victim of people who perpetuate. ANDERSON: Exactly. And your life ended up quite differently. So, where did you find the tools? Was it through feminism, was it through therapy? Was it through other incest survivors and groups and I mean, how did you reconcile that? HOLLIBAUGH: I actually think it was all of those things. I mean I came through a movement, meaning the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, that gave me the right to have that history without being ashamed. Because you do have terrible shame, I think, connected to it, and you do think that you participated in it. In fact, I actually think you do participate in it. This is a part of the feminist movement that, that I think we often havenÃ¢Â€Â™t talked about enough, that in fact thereÃ¢Â€Â™s oftenÃ¢Â€Â” whether you desired incest or not, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s parts of desire that play into the sexuality that happens. My fatherÃ¢Â€Â™s hands were some of the, were the most beautiful menÃ¢Â€Â™s hands IÃ¢Â€Â™d ever seen. I know I desired his hands. Did I desire him to rape me? No, I did not. But there was a way that he has always been a sexual figure to me. Was that true when I was seven? Yeah. Was it true when I was eleven? Yeah. And so, you know, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t like to leave myself out of my own history. Things didnÃ¢Â€Â™t just happen to me as though I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have my own complex relationship to it. But feminism and the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement gave me a context to speak about and explore my own interior world and my own damaged history. And that is an extraordinary gift and I think actually the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement has given that to women, even though itÃ¢Â€Â™s now kind of pop culture instead of politics, it still is a very different world to be, to be incested and to try and recover from incest than it was thirty years ago, or fifty years ago, like when my mother was trying to deal with all the stuff that she had gone through. And so I think that that creates a different possibility in your life. I also had friendships with women who, like Dorothy Alison, whoÃ¢Â€Â”Dorothy was the first person I ever talked to about it, and Dorothy Ã¢Â€Â” and I was one of the first people that Dorothy had ever talked to about it. And that was as much about class as it was anything else, is that we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t talk about in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement very much because the class politics in womenÃ¢Â€Â™s liberation was so bad that it completely played into the way that feminism, or womenÃ¢Â€Â™s liberation, loved to describe sexism in an un-thoughtful way around class and race. They would always say, Ã¢Â€ÂœAnd when construction workers whistle at youÃ¢Â€Â¦Ã¢Â€Â you know, but they would never describe college professors fucking you for an A. You know, it was just so fucking annoying. And Dorothy and I could finally say, we could really describe to each other, what our families were like. What the men were like and what the women were like, without being afraid that by telling the truth about our families, we were perpetuating the way that our families were hated because they were poor white trash. And, so that was an enormous gift, to have relationships with women like that, who I could begin to look at it through. And you know I, I actually did therapy around it. Though that didnÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know. I mean, that was, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t unhelpful, but itÃ¢Â€Â” therapy has never quite been the place for me. And then I started doing a lot of writing. I mean, I really, I knew that it had to inform the way I understood desire. It was part of why I was interested in sex. It was part of why I was interested in complicated stories about sex. And it was part of what I really responded against in the way that I thought feminism presented a kind of monolithic victimized history of how women were acted on but never participated in the things that they were oppressed by. And I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think that that was a helpfulÃ¢Â€Â” I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think that helped either victims or perpetrators, because I actually think, whether you deserve it or not, or whether you wanted it or not, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a question of blame. But it is a question of your own relationship to power and powerlessness. And there is something, I think, about feminism that has resulted in a kind of description of the world of women and men as though there isnÃ¢Â€Â™t something gray and connected, as well as oppressed and oppressor, that I find really disquieting. And it isnÃ¢Â€Â™t just whether all men are bad and all women are good, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s moreÃ¢Â€Â” thatÃ¢Â€Â™s why I think I ultimately ended up loving doing AIDS work, precisely because the mess of life is much more what you have to deal with there. The women that are infected by men who are HIV positive, almost invariably know that those men are likely to be HIV positive, know that they should use a condom, do not insist on it, the men donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to do it either and donÃ¢Â€Â™t do it. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not right. But itÃ¢Â€Â™s the story of how you fuck, and how you know things that you know are dangerous that you still manage to avoid. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the history that I think we in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement were not very good at allowing. It was much easier to create a world where we were finally valued, and men were finally the problem. And because of it, we were very unwilling to entertain anything that complicated the way that things were negotiated in sexism. And, if you come from a messy family where people did funky things, you really were always stuck, even in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, I think, in telling your stories. You know, I talk about how it was very hard for me to talk about how my mother was the one who was violent, not my father. Because the story that everyone wanted to tell was: my father hit me, my father spanked me, my mother blah, but never that it was my mother did this. And so, if that was your history, you felt as though you were betraying women, to say that women were capable of this. Or that you were somehow diluting the way that oppression really worked. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s true, more men hit women than women hit women, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s true, but it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t mean it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t happen. And in complicated stories, I think you generate a very different kind of coming to terms. IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to kind of bring it back around again, because I think, I think finally all the political movements that have a moral underbelly often position us in similar ways without having the possibility of complicated relationships to our own oppression and our own power. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s why itÃ¢Â€Â™s so difficult to be white and deal with racism, and why people want to beÃ¢Â€Â” why theyÃ¢Â€Â™re so defensive in that conversation if theyÃ¢Â€Â™re white, why itÃ¢Â€Â™s so hard to talk about sexism and talk about power relationships. Because thereÃ¢Â€Â™s never a way to really allow your messy history to not be cleaned up, and to not finally decide that you were right and they were wrong, you had no power and they had all of it. Rather than to look at the real framework of how you had very few choices in a world that never saw you, and you did the best you could. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s how I look at my parents. Even with all the bad things that happened. They were not bad people. They did the very best they could. They had limited tools and limited understanding. They brought the best of themselves, they tried as best they could, this is what they could do. I got what they had. They used what they had. And when they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have it anymore, they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t use it. And the job was for me to try and figure out how to survive my own history, and then make different choices. Not blame them for not having good choices. And I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think you come to terms with things like incest unless you can forgive people who have acted on you in ways that you never deserved. If you are still enragedÃ¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™m not saying itÃ¢Â€Â™s right or wrongÃ¢Â€Â” but, I think if you are still consumed with that anger you really arenÃ¢Â€Â™t at peace in yourself, you canÃ¢Â€Â™t come to terms with your own life, and so it has no dimension, that then becomes just one more reality of who you are. And if itÃ¢Â€Â™s not one more reality of who you are, it runs you. The death of that child for my mother ran my motherÃ¢Â€Â™s life, it ran her life forever. She could never forgive herself and she could never recover from it and she could never believe that she was a good person from that or that there was a world that was a world that could have hope. Because having hope would mean that you would then set yourself up to then be that kind of despair that you could never come to terms with. If thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the world that you live in, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a really miserable place to try and you know, value yourself. And, you know, I always felt like that was the elephant in the family room. That because it could never be dealt with, it could neverÃ¢Â€Â” there was never enough that my mother could ever get, or give, to make that be a piece of her history she could live with. And so she was haunted by it, and it haunted the rest of us, in a, in a way that was never visible.

And IÃ¢Â€Â™ve always thought that political movements should spend more time thinking about frameworks that actually allowed us to both confront and reconcile grief with oppression. Especially in terms of class, in terms of things like sexism and violence, because the men that perpetuate, or the women that perpetuate either of those things, but mostly men, are also men you love. And so if we could find a way in our own movements, to both hold people accountable and still love them, I think we would build a different kind of movement, that could confront real powerlessness and real oppression differently, because we would not say to people that they had to choose not to love those people any longer in order to hold them to a standard of behavior that they did not match. And, you know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a conversation we talk about. And yet, when I look at things like violence and incest and substance abuse and all of that kind of stuff, reconciliation and truth are precisely what you actually need to do, in order to be able to live with. How oppression turns you into an animal! I mean, give me a fucking break! Being poor, being hungry, being addicted, being violated yourself, being disrespected and hated, doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t turn you into a nice person. And if weÃ¢Â€Â™re ever going to, in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, come to terms with the way that we are hurt, and we hurt each other, it will be because we can actually have a different kind of dialogue that doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t assume that IÃ¢Â€Â™ll sue you or IÃ¢Â€Â™ll imprison you. ANDERSON: Right, the truth-telling itself is the end, the process is the goal.

My dad, I think, always thought of leaving, but didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have the guts. So he was constantly, as I was growing up, talking to me about other women, and you know, asked me at one point how IÃ¢Â€Â™d feel if he married my auntÃ¢Â€Â” who he had dated before he married my mother. You know, incest stuff is like, very weird, in poor white trash Ã¢Â€Â” ANDERSON: Where does that come from, for him? I mean, does that come from his family, the incest? Do you know? HOLLIBAUGH: Well, he, heÃ¢Â€Â” it is not, this is not what I know, so again. This was not, this was opaque in my family, but Ã¢Â€Â” it was very clear that my dad was attracted to his mother, and his mother was attracted to him. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s also clear that Gypsy began to teach my father about sex when he was about fiveÃ¢Â€Â”brought women in for him, and maybe participated, itÃ¢Â€Â™s never been quite clear to me what her role was, but clearly there was real stuff that went on between them, which then when my father married my mother really became a problem, because the sexuality wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just on GypÃ¢Â€Â™s part, it was my dad, too. I mean, clearly there was a sexual current between them that was intense, and that my mother found appalling. And didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to participate in, and didnÃ¢Â€Â™t approve of. And my dad then, was himself, somehow compromised I think, in his own sexuality when he was young, by his mother. Um, so, it much, very much fits the pattern. And he was pretty much sexually out of control all his life. Now with men, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a weird thing to talk about, because nobody ever thinks theyÃ¢Â€Â™re out of controlÃ¢Â€Â” ANDERSON: ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s normal. HOLLIBAUGH: ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s normal, right? So the fact that he, as far as I could figure out, he slept with anybody he could sleep with, heÃ¢Â€Â” ANDERSON: Do you think that included men? Or you mean only women and girls? HOLLIBAUGH: Well, I actually, IÃ¢Â€Â™m not sure that it did, but his best friend from high school was a gay man who married and had children and then talked to my dad about it, took my dad to gay bars and then ultimately committed suicide. One of those closet things thatÃ¢Â€Â” and when I came out, my dad talked to me a lot about it, and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI donÃ¢Â€Â™t want you to live like that, it is fine to be gay, he was a wonderful man, you can have a good life.Ã¢Â€Â My mother was appalled when I came out, but my dad knew gay people. He didnÃ¢Â€Â™t suggest that he had slept with men, but he suggested that he had flirted with men. And he was much more generous about sex. I mean, he thought sex was great; my mother thought sex was appalling. He believed in doing it as often as possible, my mother believed in doing it as rarely as possible. And he, he really, he was really an interesting guy around sexuality. But he always had lovers, always, endlessly, and I knew it from the time I was little, and IÃ¢Â€Â™m sure my mother knew it. I think the kind of deal had been that he wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t get too deeply involved, and he would never leave the marriage, and in exchange for that, she would not leave him every time he started sleeping with somebody. I also think that thatÃ¢Â€Â™s part of how I got so trapped in their sexual dynamic, is that, you know, I then became the sexual object that she was unprepared to be, which is I think what part of her guilt was so heavy around.Ã¢Â€Â” is that she knew damn well thatÃ¢Â€Â” the bottom line of a marriage is that you agree to remain someoneÃ¢Â€Â™s sexual partner through time. That is the deal. Not that you like it, but that youÃ¢Â€Â™ll do it. And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s how you can claim monogamyÃ¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™ll do it for you, youÃ¢Â€Â™ll do it for me. When in fact thatÃ¢Â€Â™s not really very possible, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a very difficult deal to keep. And so mother did a whole lot in her life to structure the impossibility of sex. She had a bad back, and she wore a metal brace, she was often illÃ¢Â€Â” I mean, she really, you know, psychosomatic illness. I mean, she really was profoundly influenced by her hatred of sex, and therefore made herself sick so that she wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have to have it. And so my dad did what was both acceptable and what was really upsetting to her, which is he had a million lovers. And, he was kind of proud of it. I mean I think he thought was wily and uuggh. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s kind of disgusting butÃ¢Â€Â” and when I got in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement the first period where I think my mother was really thinking of leaving my dad for the first time I was in a commune, and one nightÃ¢Â€Â” you know, we were all sleeping in a million different rooms, and you know, it was like, those daysÃ¢Â€Â” and I heard this woman in the room next to me having sex with somebody, and it sounded to me like my dad, and I got up the next morning, and it was! In my commune! And so that was one of the first times that I had a confrontation with my father about incest. And said to him, Ã¢Â€ÂœI know what you fucking have done, and I know what youÃ¢Â€Â™re doing now, and mom doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t know it, and this is like, unacceptable, and if you want me to expose you, I willÃ¢Â€Â” If you donÃ¢Â€Â™t stop this affair, IÃ¢Â€Â™m likeÃ¢Â€Â” because this woman that youÃ¢Â€Â™re sleeping with is in mom and myÃ¢Â€Â™s CR group, so mom is like, in her fucking CR group, this woman whoÃ¢Â€Â™s fucking you, this is like, unacceptable, sheÃ¢Â€Â™s twenty, momÃ¢Â€Â™s fifty.Ã¢Â€Â ANDERSON: Oh my God. Did he stop? HOLLIBAUGH: Yeah. He did.

While my family rode motorcycles and stuff, I got into high school. I was put in an accelerated program because I was smart. And it was too accelerated and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t really understand what was going on, and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have any help, and I started to fail. Now, I had been a straight-A student all my life. The only thing I could kind of do was read and stuff, so to fail. I remember my freshman year as one of the most horrifying years because I had never failed, and it was the only thing I really had. And so, I changed all my report cards. IÃ¢Â€Â™d get FÃ¢Â€Â™s and change them to BÃ¢Â€Â™s. And it was easy in those days, you know, they werenÃ¢Â€Â™t very, technically very sophisticated. And uhÃ¢Â€Â” ANDERSON: And that was just for your parentsÃ¢Â€Â™ benefit. HOLLIBAUGH: That was for my parentÃ¢Â€Â™s benefit. And in that failing, as my life unraveled there, I also was in terrible conflict with my mother. I had told her about the incest and she had not supported me. I had started dating men that were much older, kind of in response to that. I wasÃ¢Â€Â”and I was out a lot. I was out with girlfriends and boyfriends, I was fucking around, I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t exactly having a lot of sex yet, but you wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have known that. I became a Ã¢Â€Âœbad girl.Ã¢Â€Â And that actually had never been true for me. I had been poor white trash or mixed race in the schools, and often considered other and not someone you wanted to be a friend with or take home, but I had been a straight-A student, I had been a Ã¢Â€Âœgood girlÃ
Â€Â in that sense. In high school, as I began to fail, I really came undone.

HOLLIBAUGH: I think, the part of it that I think, just kind of to re-frame it, IÃ¢Â€Â” at the point where the incest stuff was really, where I told my mother what was going on and she refused to believe me and believed my fatherÃ¢Â€Â” ANDERSON: But that happened a number of years, rightÃ¢Â€Â” youÃ¢Â€Â™re talking at what age, here? HOLLIBAUGH: Eleven or twelve. Um, and if you look at the pictures in my book you can clearly see a shift in how old I lookÃ¢Â€Â” and it clearly happened, that was really, really, really a big crisisÃ¢Â€Â” and there wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t, you know, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s nothing you can do about itÃ¢Â€Â” your parents believe you or they donÃ¢Â€Â™t believe you. But itÃ¢Â€Â™s one of the more, itÃ¢Â€Â™s one of the most isolating and kind of terrifyingÃ¢Â€Â” because itÃ¢Â€Â™s terrifying to bring it up and then itÃ¢Â€Â™s terrifying to not be believed. And thereÃ¢Â€Â™s, there is no proof, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the point. And so, ItÃ¢Â€Â™s true that it makes parents vulnerable if a child is off-kilter. It also means that the kid has absolutely no allies that are going to help them in that mix. And no possibility of being protected. I remember very clearly, I had started to date when I was 11 or 12, but after that kind of crisisÃ¢Â€Â” and it was about a year of a crisis around itÃ¢Â€Â” I really started deciding to date older men, that I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t afford to not date men that would conceivably be able to challenge my father. And I remember thinking about it really directly, that they had to be men who, I thought, could help buffer and frighten my father. Which I knew, no 14 year old boy was going to worry my dad, my dad was incredibly strong and very athletic, and big. He was 6Ã¢Â€Â™4Ã¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™. And so, trying to figureÃ¢Â€Â” you know, youÃ¢Â€Â™re 11, youÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to figure this, youÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to work it outÃ¢Â€Â” and thereÃ¢Â€Â™s noÃ¢Â€Â” ANDERSON: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s a very creative strategy for ending the abuse. HOLLIBAUGH: Well, and it really helped. I have to say, it really helped. And the other thing I figured out to do was to date somebody that my dad knew. I thought it was more likely that I would get help there and that my dad would not transgress in some of the same ways, if the person I was dating was somebody that was in his friendship circle. And so, I decided to date older men. And I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t really very interestedÃ¢Â€Â” I mean, I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t really interested in guys anyway, but I was enormously interested in love that could save you. And that looked to me, heterosexual. And so, I was kind of obsessed with romantic love, but not very obsessed with boys

 HOLLIBAUGH: Go to movies, go to a drive-in, go toÃ¢Â€Â”you know this was rural California, so there were a lot of ruralÃ¢Â€Â”there were a lot of drive-in restaurants, you know, where you parked your car, and women came out. In fact, I used to do that kind of work and they would serve you at the side of your car and they would bring the tray and that kind of shit. Go to football games. But in rural areas, a lot of dating is also driving in cars to isolated places and trying to figure out if youÃ¢Â€Â™re going to have to fuck. So I started smoking because it was clear to me that in a bad circumstance, you could always light up, that was completely permissible, and when you were smoking a cigarette, it was very hard for a guy to come on to you, but you could also use it 
s a threat. You could keep a person distanced from you by how you held it, blowing the smoke, I mean, it was just a tool. And, my entire family smoked like, smoked like chimneys, and so, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t like I hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t started smoking already trying it out, but I remember pretty consistently at twelve, starting to smoke, a lot. And that it was completely tied to dating and to fear about sexuality. Because I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t actuallyÃ¢Â€Â” I loved being sexually provocative, but I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t particularly want to date. I mean, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to fuck. ANDERSON: Had you hit puberty at this point? HOLLIBAUGH: Yeah, IÃ¢Â€Â™d hit puberty. And, but, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â” you know, when incest is yourÃ¢Â€Â” that doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t tell you anything about sex, it just tells you about violation. So, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not as though you know more, although youÃ¢Â€Â™re not completely naÃƒÂ¯ve and you know, unaware of where a penis goes, but it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t really make a lot of sense to you. So, I started dating this guy. We didnÃ¢Â€Â™t actually have sex, although we messed around a lot. Um, but he was really a protection, against my father. He was one of my fatherÃ¢Â€Â™s friends. My father and he raced motorcycles together every Saturday; he was around all the time. He was somebody IÃ¢Â€Â™d known since I was four or five. My mother wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t too wild that I was twelve and he was 30 or 32 or something, she wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t like, thrilled on that front. But I think actually they were both, they knew IÃ¢Â€Â™d do it anyway. I mean, that was really the bottom line.

There were things we never talked about, like incest and things like that. But it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t that I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t telling her the truth, itÃ¢Â€Â™s that those things were never talked about, by anybody, to anybody.

 And those conversations in the early womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, early womenÃ¢Â€Â™s liberation movement, included lesbians and continued when there was a lesbian movement. But they started in a much earlier period and I think they were some of the most profound conversations IÃ¢Â€Â™d ever had with other women about how I was willing to Ã¢Â€Â” if my life and my position and my power finally always rested in my relationship to men, then, that was going to be the decisive factor in all the ways that I allowed myself to value women. And that might be sexual. That might be communal. That might be activist. But it was going to be in all of those places, and I had never had a conversation with other women about betraying each other. IÃ¢Â€Â™d felt endlessly betrayed by women. I had been betrayed by my mother. You know, I mean, one of the things that I think never gets talked about in incest is Ã¢Â€Â” not what the impact of incest is on you in relation to men as a woman, but what your relationship to other women is because women donÃ¢Â€Â™t defend you when youÃ¢Â€Â™re facing it as a girl-child. It is your mother t
at Ã¢Â€Â” or your aunt or your cousin, girl-cousin Ã¢Â€Â” that have to step in because itÃ¢Â€Â™s not probably going to be a guy. And if women donÃ¢Â€Â™t defend each other, then what does that mean about betrayal? You know, I always think itÃ¢Â€Â™s interesting, Bastard out of Carolina, that at least DorothyÃ¢Â€Â™s mother never said to her, Ã¢Â€ÂœYouÃ¢Â€Â™re lying.Ã¢Â€Â She couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t finally defend her. She couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t protect her and stay with that man. But she never made Dorothy Ã¢Â€Â” she never betrayed Dorothy in the sense of making Dorothy be wrong in order to excuse herself for the inability she had to protect her daughter. My mother exactly did one of those pieces that I think is extraordinarily horrifying, and that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t really ever get over, which is that she said very clearly, Ã¢Â€ÂœA man matters more than you and I will not risk my life for yours.Ã¢Â€Â And that has lots of implications parentally, but it has an equal set of meanings for gender. And so to sit in a room with women who shared my politics and begin to talk about trying to make a vow that we would not betray each other, that we would not give each otherÃ¢Â€Â™s lives up for any desire, be it sexual or ideological, was riveting. And it changed forever my relationship to other women, because it meant that Ã¢Â€Â” I still think of that and use that as a marker in the way that I try to live my life. To not ever be willing to give a woman up, even if sheÃ¢Â€Â™s willing to give herself up, and to always understand that women betray each other, and what that does to us in the ways that we never then value and trust each other and commit our lives to each other. Because committing your life to a woman whether youÃ¢Â€Â™re a dyke or youÃ¢Â€Â™re not a dyke is the hardest thing in this culture to do. To live your life for women rather than live your life for children or men, is to take a direction thatÃ¢Â€Â™s unheard of for women. And some of itÃ¢Â€Â™s queer but some of it is gendered and I think, much bigger than whether you can come with a female lover.

IÃ¢Â€Â™m attracted to the most outrageously different women in this bar. And the more butch they are, the more trans they are, the more gender different they are, the more I like them. Well now, this really Ã¢Â€Â” I mean I actually, as a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s liberationist, I actually, you know, IÃ¢Â€Â™ve written about it. It was a crisis then and it was a crisis again after I broke up with my first butch lover. Because I Ã¢Â€Â” the accusations and implications that surround you as a fem is that the reason you like masculinity is because youÃ¢Â€Â™re actually straight. And that the reason youÃ¢Â€Â™re not straight is because you donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to deal with men or you had Ã¢Â€Â” youÃ¢Â€Â™ve had a horrible experience with men, youÃ¢Â€Â™re an incest survivor [laugh]. Your father didnÃ¢Â€Â™t treat you well. Oh, God. And so, you know, youÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to work it out by being with butch women. And I was really horrified that it looked to me like my desire for women and my particular kind of desire for butch women meant that I was betraying feminism. That I was betraying what I said I believed about power and powerlessness, about no roles about Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, those things that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve tried to actually write about in resistance flooded me in the beginning and really Ã¢Â€Â” I was really horrified at myself.

And I think sex exploded in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement as kind of the Ã¢Â€Â” I think sex was used Ã¢Â€Â” the explosion around sex, I think, in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement was the cover for class. Because I think it was, in talking about sex, you had to talk about lived experience, you had to talk about background and history. It couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be theoretical. It couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be only theoretical. And, I think that conversation made the divide between people from different kinds of histories and backgrounds very clear. And so a profound fight then broke out about sex that was embedded in the kind of direction feminism had gone in but it also, I think, was profoundly impacted by the way that class and desire ran under those conversations in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement. Of what pornography was and who read it. Of pedophilia and the kind of the assumptions of, you know, pedophilia being about scuzzy men who were poor and slimy. I mean, those were all class assumptions, you know? Pedophilia was never about Harvard professors and, you know, blah-blah-blah-blah. And so, the assumptions then about class and sex, I think, really were embedded in the way feminism reacted to the challenge that different parts of the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement were facing, both from class and from race. And when that article Ã¢Â€Â” and so, I was just Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, I just couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t believe what happened to me from that article and the way that people talked to me. ANDERSON: How did they talk to you? HOLLIBAUGH: Well, in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, people would feel unbelievably confident to come up and say really unbelievable things to me about my sexuality. ANDERSON: Like in the bookstore? HOLLIBAUGH: Yeah, I mean, I would be someplace and somebody hear my name and come up and say, you know, Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m a feminist and I want to tell you that I think what you write about is sick and disgusting and is Ã¢Â€Â” you know, you may consider yourself a feminist but I donÃ¢Â€Â™t consider yourself a feminist,Ã¢Â€Â and I mean, it would just go on and, Ã¢Â€ÂœYouÃ¢Â€Â™re a deviantÃ¢Â€Â and it was like Ã¢Â€Â” and people felt pretty free to- ANDERSON: -(two voices, unclear) about- HOLLIBAUGH: Yeah, and that youÃ¢Â€Â™re, you know, Ã¢Â€ÂœDo you know what youÃ¢Â€Â™re doing to women?

Talk about your transition from leaving the feminist movement, womenÃ¢Â€Â™s liberation movement, to focus on your work on AIDS. HOLLIBAUGH: When I moved to New York, I was working in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s bookstore that Carrie London owned on the upper west side. ANDERSON: Oh, okay. HOLLIBAUGH: I was working for a feminist organization that was part of Monthly Review Press that translated Latin-American feminist material and, you know, blah-blah-blah. So I was very much in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement and Barnard and all of the rest of that was my world. And, especially moving to New York, I felt like Ã¢Â€Â” you know, I was with Esther, Esther was a feminist, she was an academic. We had kind of a queer feminist academic world, but once Barnard happened and the aftereffect of Barnard, and that was a couple years Ã¢Â€Â” Barnard was like, in Ã¢Â€Â™81 or Ã¢Â€Â™82? ANDERSON: Ã¢Â€Â™82. HOLLIBAUGH: 1982, and already I was dealing with having lived in San Francisco and now living in New York in terms of AIDS. So, you know, I had lived on the two coasts where the number of cases was just enormous and because IÃ¢Â€Â™d had ongoing close friendships with so many gay men, and sexually active gay men, the number of people that I knew right from the very beginning of the epidemic was really large, and so I was dealing with it in every part of my life, even though I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t doing any movement stuff about it, and Esther was dealing with it all the time because sheÃ¢Â€Â™d had so many gay men friends, it was kind of a reality for both of us, and as the Barnard stuff continued and was relentless and after Barnard, then trying to figure out how to womp up the kind of collective power to stop Women Against Pornography, and kind of the whole trend of where that was going. Because it as huge. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just about pornography. It was in every dimension about feminism and about what feminism would represent and how it would represent women and womenÃ¢Â€Â™s oppression and kind of what happened to women and what we would say we understood about womenÃ¢Â€Â™s lives and experiences. So, to me, the fight around pornography and around violence against women and all of those kind of things was Ã¢Â€Â” and where it had resulted, where it had ended by, kind of being siphoned into these identity-based movements, kind of violence Ã¢Â€Â” domestic violence, any pornography, rape crisis, blah-blah, you know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like, God, did I never mean this to happen. And ANDERSON: Can I put a little parenthesis around one quick question here? HOLLIBAUGH: Yeah. ANDERSON: Does that mean that the incest-survivors movement along with domestic, rape survivors, etc.Ã¢Â€Â” was that a movement that resonated for you? That you felt identify with or connected to, or did you feel Ã¢Â€Â“ HOLLIBAUGH: Nope. ANDERSON: -really disconnected from the politics that? HOLLIBAUGH: Well, hereÃ¢Â€Â™s what I felt like Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, I had not started talking about incest until 1980 or Ã¢Â€Â™81 when I met Dorothy. I had quietly said to friends and lovers what had happened to me or some version of that although pretty caut
ously. But again, in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement when I would try to talk about my experience of incest, the class stuff was so sickening that I then ended up having to defend my father or my cousins or my uncle and say, or my mother, I Ã¢Â€Â” so, when Dorothy and I met, and CherrÃƒÂ­ie was doing antiviolence work then, she was in New York and she was doing domestic violence work, IÃ¢Â€Â™m sure. And that was her job. And so Dorothy and CherrÃƒÂ­e and I would spend a lot of time talking about it. But DorothyÃ¢Â€Â™s who I first told the truth to, because DorothyÃ¢Â€Â™s life around that and my life around that were really quite similar although in different places, but equal Ã¢Â€Â” not equally but in all the ways that people donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to deal with the meaning of it, they were violent and transgressive and relentless and all of that stuff. And so it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t shameful to talk to her about my own history and so I could finally think about it and talk about it and we started doing a little bit of work around it with CherrÃƒÂ­e. We realized the class stuff was so bad that we couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t figure out how to talk about without it instantly kind of sinking into a class discussion that we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have any tools for and that there was no markers around. So, people would Ã¢Â€Â” felt completely free to comment on what they thought of your family. And I think parallel to that at the same time was the Ã¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t even know how to say this, but the accelerating aspect of feminism that made your victim status the most relevant totality of your experience, that you never had a relationship to your own oppression, that you never had a complicated relationship to what was done to you, that you never participated in it in any way. In order to try to say that women had not been asking for rape or incest, we went to a place that was really dangerous. (cough) Do we need to stop? Anyway, the tragedy of the attempt to reclaim womenÃ¢Â€Â™s lives by making us victims so that we could assign responsibility where we thought we had been powerless, and so we could reclaim womenÃ¢Â€Â™s right to, you know, claim that they were raped even though they were married, or incested even though they had been provocative little girls, you know, all of that kind of stuff, I think, had a terrible ultimate impact on where feminism ended up. Kind of making its arguments for what happened to women and what you had to think about. And that became an impossible place for me. I mean, I just felt like, you know, it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t make it OK to say what my father did to me. IÃ¢Â€Â™m not saying itÃ¢Â€Â™s OK that my father raped me by also saying that I was attracted to his hands, but I donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to leave one piece of it out in order to also talk about the other. And in incest stuff, for me, I found it really difficult precisely because my father was the person that I was the closest to in my family, and the violation was extraordinarily twisted precisely because IÃ¢Â€Â™m most like him and he most held out for me in my family and so what happens Ã¢Â€Â” what betrayal looks like when it also is connected to the very best that you Ã¢Â€Â” that somebody brought to you of love and hope is not either you were a victim and they were a monster or you deserved it and they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know what they were doing. And I kept feeling like the world was now shrinking into a whole variety of ideological sides that flattened the power of feminism, to speak to and help women understand and move forward their own lives. It just isnÃ¢Â€Â™t going anywhere, and, you know, it was before really gay studies had taken off, and sexuality studies, all that kind of stuff wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t really Ã¢Â€Â” not in the Ã¢Â€Â™80s, certainly, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t happening. So I was losing all these people and I was also Ã¢Â€Â” I just felt like, all IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to do is get more and more bitter if I stay here and I really have to Ã¢Â€Â” for a variety of reasons, not just feminism, I have to rethink my life.

So again, I feel that feminism has played an essential role in the work that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve done and what itÃ¢Â€Â™s allowed me to do, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s also limited its own possibility of generating what I think it intrinsically could have done because of who it was afraid of allowing to enter its centrality of voice. If feminism as well as lesbian feminism is fundamentally a narrative of womenÃ¢Â€Â™s stories that collectively generate ideology and theory and practice, then if [at] that center is absent women of color, working-class and poor women, women with an extraordinarily different set of sexual histories and class histories, then you donÃ¢Â€Â™t Ã¢Â€Â” you donÃ¢Â€Â™t have at the center the majority of womenÃ¢Â€Â™s lives. And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what feminism is missing, is the majority of women never joined that movement. And they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t join it because feminism was wrong, but because feminism had a bias in it about class and race. And by implication, then, about sex and homophobia. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s a tragedy to me that though there were many women like myself in that movement, including in places of relative power Ã¢Â€Â” you know, I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t a powerless foot soldier through that whole story, we were always marginal outsiders invited in, and then left out. Barbara Smith tells basically the same narrative. Cherrie tells the same narrative. Dorothy tells the same, Jewel tells the same. Because we were always both endlessly desired and profoundly worrisome voices to the way that the stories were being constructed and the way that the ideology flowed from the personal is political. Well, what personal? If poverty is as essential to the way you understand violation as incest, then a very different story gets told. If incarceration and racism is as fundamental to the identity that you have as a lesbian woman as any other piece of it, if youÃ¢Â€Â™re constantly having to pick, you know, Pat Parker really did say, you know, Ã¢Â€ÂœSome day I want to go to a party and bring my entire self.Ã¢Â€Â And nobody did ever say it better than that. And the movement never allowed the totality of identities to merge in the way that the movement created its agenda and understood the world that it was functioning in. And therefore, it really limped, even though it was so powerful, even in spite of it, that it still had resonance for huge numbers of women.

 Marine-Street: You also mentioned in the other interview that you had kind of a traumatic childhood. In your papers that are at Smith College, you have a biographical statement that you wrote. In it you talk about some instances of sexual violence that happened. I wonder if you'd be willing to just talk a little bit about those. Gartrell: [00:04:30] When I was six years old, we lived next door to a physician who had three sons. One of them was a teenager. He and a friend of his lured me and my brother over to their treehouse and said, "Wouldn't you like to come see our treehouse?" He said, "You go up first"  to me and I started climbing, and I said, "Come on, Greg" [to my brother]. And he [the neighbor] said, "No, no, you wait down there." They wouldn't let him up. They got me up there, and they had a .22 rifle and they pointed the rifle at me and demanded that I engage in sexual activity with them, which I don't think there's a point in describing, but it was phenomenally traumatic. I thought that they were going to kill me, and they threatened to come get me if I told anyone. What happened afterwards was I got down, and I burst into tears and ran to my home. My mother and father were both home at the time. My father examined me physically, which was further embarrassing, and then went over and screamed at the neighbors and told them he was calling the police. Then they consulted--I don't know whom--who said that it would be very traumatic for me to go to court to testify against these boys, and it was better just to leave [it as it was, with] whatever threat my father made against them. We lived in that house for another year and a half. I was terrified every single day. I was terrified every single night. I was afraid they were going to crawl into my window. I actually was terrified throughout the rest of my childhood about the prospect of being raped or assaulted after that incident. Marine-Street: Were there any ramifications for the assaulters? Gartrell: [00:06:35] None whatsoever. When we moved to a new home far across town from where they lived, there was an unfortunate response on my mothers part to a question I asked in a veiled way, hoping that it wouldn't be obvious why I was asking the question. I said to her, "Do you think there's any chance those neighbors know where we live now?" She said, "Oh, of course, I'm sure they know," which just took away any feeling of safety that I could have had at this new home. Marine-Street: Did you get any kind of counseling or help? Gartrell: [00:07:13] No. 18 Marine-Street: What did they call what happened to you in those days? Gartrell: [00:07:22] Teenage boys acting badly. Marine-Street: Has your understanding of that changed over time? Gartrell: [00:07:32] It was sexual violence at gunpoint and very, very, very traumatic. Marine-Street: You also mentioned to me that you almost were kidnapped. Was that about that same time? Gartrell: [00:07:48] It was a few years later. We lived next to a lemon orchard. Our house backed up against the lemon orchard. We were not a family of means. We lived in a small track house in Santa Barbara. Our school bus dropped us off about, I would say, a fifteen-minute walk from my home. I had seen a car that followed the school bus frequently, and it was an old man driving an old car. On most days when we were dropped off, there were many of us children. On this particular day, I was the only one. I got off the bus, and I was walking in a fairly leisurely way next to the lemon orchard to my home. This car pulled up next to me, and he rolled down his window, and he said, "You need to get in. You need to get in." He looked very frightening to me, and I started running, and he started following me. There was enough room where he could follow me off the road. I started screaming and running, and I ran through the lemon orchard [so] he couldn't take his car through the lemon orchard. I got into my house the back way and went into my room and looked out the window, and I saw that he was cruising by trying to find me. I told my parents. They then called the police and they allegedly looked for this person, but I [often] saw the car [parked] within a mile of our home and no one ever apprehended 19 the person. It was another instance in which, again, there was a complete lack of feeling safe. Marine-Street: What did you do as a child after those instances to kind of make yourself feel safe? Gartrell: [00:09:57] I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t feel safe. I felt frightened all the time. I felt frightened in my home, outside of my home. I was always afraid of being raped. I was always afraid of being assaulted. Marine-Street: How can you function if you're always afraid? Gartrell: [00:10:12] There are a lot of things that contributed to fear in my life and my parents unfortunately were not psychologically healthy. There was major mental illness in my family so I had that factor contributing to my state of not feeling safe. My father had severe panic disorder, and he was pretty much afraid of the world and afraid of going anywhere. When you have a role model of one parent who is afraid of the world and another parent who was quite mentally ill in a different way, it's not an environment in which a child grows up being given an opportunity to feel safe. On top of that, I then had teachers who hit on me before I left for college. For instance, when I was a tenth grade student, I had a Latin teacher who said to me he wanted to start driving me home. I thought that I needed to comply with that, [but when I] told my father and mother, they said, "Well, he can come here and meet us, but he's not driving you home." He touched me in ways that were very creepy. Touched my body and his hands were not where they should be. I mean, here I was doing well academically and having somebody trying to paw me and trying to drive me home.

 Marine-Street: Interesting. What about the free love movement you mentioned? Can you tell me how that manifested itself in the environment as you experienced it? Gartrell: [00:37:33] IÃ¢Â€Â™ll say something about encounter groups. The summer before we entered Stanford, to my knowledge, every one of us received a letter offering the opportunity to participate in an encounter group when we arrived. It was described as an opportunity to have a member of the Counseling and Testing Center meet with a small group of us to talk about our experiences and to get to know one another well and share things that we might not feel comfortable sharing just in general. But, you know, in a safe environment. I read it. My parents read it. At first I thought, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhy not, it sounds good.Ã¢Â€Â My parents read it and thought, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, wow, free therapy. Great. So do it.Ã¢Â€Â I signed up to do it and we met. In my group, for some strange reason, my RA who happened to become my lover was in my group but there were no other women. There were about five other men and then we had a male who was a member of the 32 Counseling and Testing Center staff running the group. We met in Escondido--in one of the Escondido apartments--I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if theyÃ¢Â€Â™re still called Escondido Apartments. Are they still called that? The tall buildings that are across from the firehouse. Marine-Street: I think they are--Escondido, yes. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re doing a lot of reconstruction up there right now. Gartrell: [00:39:00] I know. EverythingÃ¢Â€Â™s changing. There were apartments that senior students could live in. So two women who were seniors lived there, and they allowed us to use their apartment. It was clear from the very beginning that the conversations were going in the direction of sex and talking about sexual feelings and that was something that seemed to be thrilling to the men to be able to do and felt creepy to me. Early into these meetings, we were told to pair off and there were all those kinds of touchy-feely things that were done back then in group dynamics where you close your eyes and, you know, see what you can communicate to another person through holding their hands like this and things like that. That kind of pairing off, we were given some instructions about that. I found out later that the woman who became my lover, my RA, and the man she was paired off with--what he did was he reached around, undid her bra, and was feeling her breasts during that encounter. That made me feel incredibly freaked out. She didnÃ¢Â€Â™t complain. She just went along with it. She was sexually involved with men before she became involved with me. I guess, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know, some number of sessions later, we arrived and the group leader was on the couch holding the hands and stroking one of the women 33 who lived in the apartment. He said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, letÃ¢Â€Â™s resume later.Ã¢Â€Â She went into the bedroom, and we started our meeting and he stopped it after, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know, five or ten minutes. And he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou know, I have some unfinished business to do with whatÃ¢Â€Â™s-her-name and so why donÃ¢Â€Â™t you carry on without me.Ã¢Â€Â We kind of, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know, carried on somehow without him. I had to go to the bathroom, and I got up to go to the bathroom, and the door to the room was open and they were having sex. And I, from other women classmates, heard similar stories of power and sex abuse by these people who supposedly represented mental health professionals affiliated with Stanford, which was just appalling. Marine-Street: Was he a student? Gartrell: [00:41:43] No, he was a member of the Counseling and Testing Center staff in the Dean of Students Office at the Old Union. Marine-Street: The girl that he was having sex with was an older student? Gartrell: [00:41:55] Student, yes. She was a senior. Marine-Street: But an undergraduate? Gartrell: [00:41:57] Yes. Marine-Street: Well thatÃ¢Â€Â™s an encounter group I guess. Gartrell: [00:42:01] Yes, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s an encounter of a sort. Marine-Street: Yes, of a sort. Anything else on that topic? You wrote somewhere that it was Ã¢Â€Âœan environment of daily sexual harassmentÃ¢Â€Â during that time. Gartrell: [00:42:14] Yes. It was. Another illustration of the kind of commentary that was just routine and so irritating when it happened was initially when I got there, I guess miniskirts werenÃ¢Â€Â™t in fashion yet, but they kind of became in 34 fashion. I wore skirts and shorts. I wore a lot of shorts while it was hot and then I wore skirts some of the time. Actually, they were culotte skirts so that they were kind of like shorts. And my skirts got somewhat shorter as time went on because that was the fashion. I happened to generally make my own clothes because we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have the money to buy them. As I came out and became involved in--or had much more awareness of--feminism and got really excited about the beginning of the second wave of feminism, I started changing my clothing style and wearing clothes that were comfortable, not clothes that attracted attention from men. Because my short skirts--well, I mean, I figured all women attracted attention from men--but I felt that the way I dressed attracted attention and it was unwanted attention. I started wearing comfortable clothes that felt so good and so safe. That included overalls and turtlenecks when it was cold. One of my classmates said to me, after I had started wearing these clothes, turned over to me before our class started and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou know I liked you a lot better when you were wearing miniskirts. You really look terrible in overalls.Ã¢Â€Â Marine-Street: This is a male classmate? Gartrell: [00:44:26] A male classmate. Marine-Street: How did you respond? Do you remember? Gartrell: [00:44:29] I just looked kind of horrified and I felt just invaded, and I felt it was an indication of this kind of entitlement to dictate the clothing of a classmate and very aware of the difference in my feeling of safety wearing overalls and a turtleneck versus a short skirt. 35 Marine-Street: Interesting. WeÃ¢Â€Â™ll go for just a little longer and then weÃ¢Â€Â™ll take a break. Did you ever talk to any of your female friends about these issues about dress or the encounter groups? Did others feel your discomfort? Gartrell: [00:45:26] Others talked about their encounter group leaders then, but my very close friends and I have talked about the abuse of power since then. It was something that none of them felt good about. Back then, my friends were dating males and I was involved with a woman. The friendships were very, very important to me and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to do anything that criticized men as a group and potentially jeopardize the friendships. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t really have a peer group with whom I could have these conversations since they were part of--they were dating the patriarchal structure and I was not.

Marine-Street: One more question related to this. Did you have any knowledge of sexual assaults that were occurring on campus? Was that something that happened then? Gartrell: [00:49:00] Yes, we were told periodically about rapes that happened and women being assaulted outside our dorm. This was starting our first year at Stanford. The lighting was very poor. Our bikes were parked in really dim lighting. I already came to Stanford as a frightened person--worrying about assault and violence. This was not helpful to me at all. We did, as our peer group of women, talk about our fears of going to the library at night. I was petrified of going to the library at night because it involved going out to get my bike where it was dimly lit, where anyone could be grabbed, riding my bike through dark streets to the library, and at both of those places locking the 37 bike. All of these things, if thereÃ¢Â€Â™s nobody else around, made me quite vulnerable and then being in the library, studying until whatever hour, and then making my way back. I was petrified. I mean, from the moment I left the dorm I was petrified. The whole process of thinking about going to the library made me petrified, which meant that I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t go as often as I wanted to or needed to, which meant that I felt that my [education suffered]. Well, I mean, it was my choice about safety or my fears about safety that prevented me from making adequate uses of the library. At that time, there were no [alarm boxes]. I know now that it seems like every twenty feet, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s an alarm box and I also know that there is [00:50:53] a lot of attention to safety. IÃ¢Â€Â™m not talking about the kind of safety that involves drinking alcohol and saying no. IÃ¢Â€Â™m talking about just trying to go to the library or trying to go to a night class. I mean, there were things that were happening at night that unless I was going as a member of a group, it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t feel safe attending. Marine-Street: Did you and any of the other women students do anything to try to feel more safe? Gartrell: [00:51:25] No, we just didnÃ¢Â€Â™t feel safe and--I mean, it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t occur to us that we had an opportunity to do anything. Marine-Street: Was there any kind of like self-defense courses or anything? Gartrell: [00:51:37] I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember what year it was, but I think it was probably my senior year that a self-defense course was offered, not as an elective but just as a campus activity, and I took it. I found out about it however--going to school at a time when there was no internet, any information you received 38 was word-of-mouth, you happened to have the time to read a flyer in White Plaza, or you happened to have time to read the Stanford Daily, or you had access to the Daily regularly, which I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t always, especially if I was living off-campus. It was really a matter of luck if you found out about something that you really wanted to do and needed to do. But somehow I found out about it. I attended this class and I loved it. I loved the concept of being taught that I was entitled to pay attention to my fears and that whenever I did feel afraid--whenever something happened that made me feel more afraid--I should pay attention to my feelings because they were a good indicator of my potential risk. My lover who had sex with men before she met me, [and] had sex with men throughout the time she was with me--she was not comfortable being lesbian, didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to identify as lesbian, wanted to get married, [and] spent the whole time that I was at Stanford looking for a man to marry at the same time she was involved with me--always said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, youÃ¢Â€Â™re just a wimp, you know, stop being so afraid. What are you so afraid of? YouÃ¢Â€Â™re so afraid of sex with men? Why are you so uptight? YouÃ¢Â€Â™re just incredibly uptight?Ã¢Â€Â Always the message, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou are really, really uptight.Ã¢Â€Â To have this validation in this self-defense class that paying attention to [my feeling of fear]--granted, I came from a background of more fear that I carried within me than I wish I ever did--but that if something kicked it up to a higher level, that my feelings were valid and I needed to pay attention to them and I needed to do something about them immediately. Then to learn self-defense techniques to fight or to fight back or to release myself was 39 fabulous. It was such an incredible opportunity to have--to create a sense of empowerment. Marine-Street: Was it a male instructor, do you remember? Gartrell: [00:54:27] Absolutely not. It was all women. Marine-Street: All women? Gartrell: [00:54:29] Yes, I wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have taken a course from a man because how could a man possibly have come from our experience and seen the world in the way we saw the world? Marine-Street: It was another student that was doing it? Do you recall? Gartrell: [00:54:45] Yes, I believe it was another student or somebody from offcampus who came. Marine-Street: Do you remember where they taught the classes? Gartrell: [00:54:52] They were taught in the Roble Gym. Marine-Street: Does anything stick with you about what they taught you like specific techniques? Gartrell: [00:55:03] They were techniques about releasing yourself if someone grabs you and there were techniques about the most vulnerable [ways] to fight back if you were assaulted. I go from that, fast forward to many years later when I got to know Pauline Bart who was a very eloquent writer about rape and women fighting back. She did studies about women who were trained to or learned to fight back versus women who were trained to lie down and take it. I had heard always growing up that if youÃ¢Â€Â™re assaulted; youÃ¢Â€Â™re going to be killed if you fight back--until I took this class. 40 When I got to Pauline BartÃ¢Â€Â™s readings and then got to know her as a colleague and heard that there were actual data that the women who fought back, very often, got away and were not raped versus those who submitted were a hundred percent raped. There was no guarantee they werenÃ¢Â€Â™t going to be killed. It was an incredibly eye-opening experience. Marine-Street: IÃ¢Â€Â™ll say. LetÃ¢Â€Â™s take a quick break. Gartrell: [00:56:29] Okay. [End of Part 1 of 5 - Interview with Nanette Gartrell - August 29, 2018] 41 42 STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROJECT: STANFORD PIONEERING WOMEN ALUMNAE ORAL HISTORY PROJECT INTERVIEWEE: NANETTE GARTRELL INTERVIEWER: NATALIE MARINE-STREET DATE OF INTERVIEW: AUGUST 29, 2018 PART: 2 OF 5 Marine-Street: Before we move on, is there anything else youÃ¢Â€Â™d like to say about the selfdefense course? Gartrell: [00:00:06] One other thing that just came to mind is in Pauline BartÃ¢Â€Â™s research about lying down and taking it versus fighting back--and fighting back included using strategies to extract yourself. There were accounts that she provided of women who actually talked men who had weapons out of their weapons and then managed to escape without being assaulted. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s really quite phenomenal but not only did she find that if you do fight back or use a strategy to escape that you have a chance of not being sexually violated. But even if you were raped and you fought back, that the psychological sequelae for those who resisted versus those who didnÃ¢Â€Â™t was dramatically different. That is fascinating. That was always fascinating to me. The fighters ultimately did better than those who thought that they had to comply and didnÃ¢Â€Â™t try any strategies. Not that theyÃ¢Â€Â™re to be blamed-those who are to be blamed are the police and the men who told us, Ã¢Â€ÂœDonÃ¢Â€Â™t 43 resist, donÃ¢Â€Â™t resist.Ã¢Â€Â They are to be blamed, and I have strong feelings about that.

Gartrell: [00:06:05] Since, once again, I tend to be the person whoÃ¢Â€Â™s talking about the radical topics even in my group of peers, IÃ¢Â€Â™m, once again, bringing up the topics that people donÃ¢Â€Â™t generally enjoy hearing about. That seems to be my mission in life. There are two topics--weÃ¢Â€Â™ll get to my thirty-two year and counting National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re thrilled with that study. So many of them are moms, and theyÃ¢Â€Â™re just so happy that IÃ¢Â€Â™m doing the study. My work related to sex abuse by physicians led to my decision to give a talk in I believe it was 1992 or 1993 at Women in Medicine on ethics and boundaries for lesbian physicians because we already knew from data that had been gathered that female-female cases were the second highest percentage of reported abuse cases. The majority were male physician/male therapist-female patient. Going way, way, way, way down in the percentages but the next highest category--thirteen percent of cases--were female-female. I knew of cases. They had come to my attention. They were just as abusive and just as damaging to the patient as any other case of abuse. I stood up in front of this group, and I talked about why we needed ethics codes and why we needed to be just as vigilant in our own community as we expect our male colleagues to be in the community of physicians. Then I gave case example after case example which were, I think, really eyeopening and horrifying to members of the audience. I was asked to repeat that [presentation] or do an updated version of that presentation this year. I was asked actually before the #MeToo movement started. The #MeToo 98 movement became the backdrop of the talk that I just presented a few weeks ago. When the Q&A happened at this talk, lesbian physician after lesbian physician stood up who had been there in the first talk and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI remember when you gave your first talk. It was eye-opening for me. It changed the way I practiced. It changed the way I understood the dynamics of power abuse. One of the messages that youÃ¢Â€Â™ve said very clearly is that we, as women, very often think we donÃ¢Â€Â™t have the power to abuse but, in fact, we do. I learned that from you then, and I hope you young people here learn that again or learn that for the first time from her today.Ã¢Â€Â That was one example of a very radical presentation in my own group that was already a radical group. [00:09:54]

Marine-Street: ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s amazing. We had started talking about the APA and your work on the Committee on Women. I know that that led into an important research focus for you. Can we talk a little bit about that now? Gartrell: [00:16:41] Yes, when I became chair of the Committee on Women, my understanding of the responsibility was--this was 1982--to advocate for womenÃ¢Â€Â™s mental health on a national basis. So that if there was a problem related to womenÃ¢Â€Â™s mental health, it was the responsibility of the Committee on Women to figure it out and do something about it. Very soon after I assumed the position, I heard that the number of malpractice claims filed against psychiatrists through the American Psychiatric AssociationÃ¢Â€Â™s insurance carrier --they had an insurance carrier at that time--based on allegations of sexual abuse of the patient, were skyrocketing. At that time, we were coming off the 1960s and 1970s, the free love era, [aka] anything goes. There were no ethics codes. There were no licensing board regulations. There were no laws about this. For me and for those on 102 my committee, it was a no-brainer. Your patients are not there for you to have sex with. Your patients come to you because they have psychological difficulties for which they need help. We started looking into this, and we were getting more and more information about this as a potential problem but by then, I was already quite wise to the fact that the APA was [laughter] an institution in which there was a tremendous amount of resistance to change and that it seemed unlikely that we could do anything about the problem that we were hearing about until we had evidence documenting it. I proposed that we put together a questionnaire, and get the APA to agree to send it out to all the psychiatrists in the country and do it in a neutral fashion because, again, there were no ethics codes, there were no laws, there were no licensing board regulations. With nothing in place saying itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a bad thing, you could just ask the questions in a neutral way and maybe people would answer the questions. Have you been sexually involved with a patient? If you have, how long did the relationship last? Is it still ongoing? Questions like that and then we got a little further into it. Have you been involved with more than one patient? How many patients have you been with and can you tell us how many patients youÃ¢Â€Â™ve been involved with? We put together this questionnaire. We submitted it through the channels, and we were stonewalled by committee after committee after committee that was responsible for approving projects like this. [We were] starting to get accusations like, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhat [are you] trying to do? [You are] going to destroy the credibility of the psychiatric profession.Ã¢Â€Â We were going to destroy the credibility of the 103 psychiatric profession? To us, it seemed as though psychiatrists who were sexually abusing their patients were destroying the credibility of the psychiatric profession. We continued to push forward and said we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t agree and we wanted to do this survey and we wanted the APA to sponsor it. At a certain point, it became clear that it was re-cycling back through the same committees that had already rejected it. I had brought onto the Committee on Women, Judith Herman, whoÃ¢Â€Â™s my really good friend and colleague, and Silvia Olarte, another psychiatrist. There were other members of the committee who were very much in support of this project. [00:20:54] We decided we would give the APA a deadline. If they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t approve the project by this deadline, we would do the study ourselves independently. They actually didnÃ¢Â€Â™t imagine that I could get the mailing labels in order to send out the questionnaire to psychiatrists in the country because this was--again--before everyone had computers in their homes, and they owned the mailing labels for the Psychiatric Association. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how they printed them out when they needed them--I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember whether they printed envelopes or labels or what they had. They just figured theyÃ¢Â€Â™d let the deadline pass and that it was a false statement on my part that I could actually do it independently. But what they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know is while we were waiting for the deadline, first of all, IÃ¢Â€Â™d contacted two individuals at the Harvard School of Public Health about doing the statistics. And that continuing medical education was beginning to be a booming and profitable industry. So we were starting to get mailings about continuing medical 104 education courses. They were coming through the AMA. I was never a member of the AMA because--talk about organizations that were never progressive enough for me--that was certainly one of them! The AMA was located in Chicago. I contacted the Harvard Continuing Medical Education Office, and I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhen youÃ¢Â€Â™re sending out CME courses, how do you get your mailing labels? Do you have your own?Ã¢Â€Â They said, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo, no, we get them through a clearinghouse through the AMA in Chicago.Ã¢Â€Â And they gave me the number. I already had plans to conduct a course on ethics in medicine and in psychiatry and so I had already been kind of thinking along these lines. I contacted this clearinghouse, and I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m a Harvard faculty member and IÃ¢Â€Â™m planning to do this course and how would I obtain mailing labels?Ã¢Â€Â I [also asked], Ã¢Â€ÂœHow many do you have for psychiatrists?Ã¢Â€Â I think they had 25,000 or something. I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœAnd how much would that cost?Ã¢Â€Â It was very expensive. Every study that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve done, IÃ¢Â€Â™ve essentially funded myself out of my own earnings. I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, could you randomly select every fifth psychiatrist in the country, and how much would that cost?Ã¢Â€Â And they said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh yes, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a problem.Ã¢Â€Â That was several thousand dollars, but I was willing to pay for it. They said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWeÃ¢Â€Â™ll give them to you zip code sequenced, which, as it turned out, is a very big deal because when youÃ¢Â€Â™re taking things in bulk to the post office, which I did not know previously, you have to put them in bags [that are] zip code sequenced. I got all those arrangements made. The deadline came and passed. I contacted the clearinghouse. I got the labels 105 shipped to me; again, sitting on the floor--always I was seemingly [sitting] on hardwood floors stuffing envelopes after printing out questionnaires. [00:24:16] We had thankfully moved away from mimeograph into being able to have Xerox copies back then. [I spent days] stuffing these envelopes, putting stamps on them, getting them to the post office. We sent them out to every fifth psychiatrist in the country. Officials at the APA went ballistic when some of them received this questionnaire. They thought I had broken into the APA and stolen the labels, gotten into the office and stolen the labels! They had no idea that I could possibly do this without breaking in. I assured them that I had a plan to conduct a course based on the results of the study. They were just apoplectic about this. We got the questionnaires back. We also got some that said things like, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe believe you have secretly coded these questionnaires, and there is no circumstance in which I would fill it out because I believe you can identify us.Ã¢Â€Â We received back a lot of obscenities and very hostile comments. Leaving aside the obscenities and the blank questionnaires that they sent back that we had to pay the postage on, of course, because they often stuffed them with heavy things so we had to pay more postage, we tabulated our results. Seven percent of psychiatrists acknowledged being sexually involved with their patients and a number of those had been involved with more than one patient. All our publications are available to be read so IÃ¢Â€Â™m not going to go into details of numbers. They can be downloaded also--many of them--on our study websites

 We then did a number of follow-up studies including studying senior residents--all senior residents--in terms of their sexual involvement with patients and already there were some who were sexually involved with patients. I heard endlessly from psychiatrists, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhy donÃ¢Â€Â™t you survey the other specialties? OB/GYNs, surgeons, family practitioners, internists? Surely theyÃ¢Â€Â™re sexually involved with patients too,Ã¢Â€Â as if that justified a
ything. When I [joined the UCSF faculty], I gathered colleagues in other fields and, in fact, we did that study too. And, in fact, found [that], yes, indeed, [physicians in other specialties were abusing patients too]. Also from their own assessment of the impact on patients who had been sexually involved with non-psychiatric physicians whom they knew of, that the consequences were always damaging to the patients. We knew from data we had been gathering over the [prior] decade that most patients who were abused by psychiatrists [or other mental health professionals] ended up severely depressed when the relationships terminated, which they did inevitably. Ten percent were psychiatrically hospitalized and one percent committed suicide. We even had people write in things on their questionnaires like, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou know, IÃ¢Â€Â™m not really sure that this involvement is worth the effort. This patient was terribly dysfunctional to begin with and things just got worse after the sexual involvement so IÃ¢Â€Â™m not really sure that this is something that IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to continue.Ã¢Â€Â This is what we 108 were dealing with. The point of all of this was we had a mission, a mission to establish ethics codes, to have licensing board regulations that made it very clear that sexual involvement with any patient was unacceptable. Our mission [encompassed] any current or former patient. We donÃ¢Â€Â™t have that in all the regulations, but it has also become a felony in many states. And there are reporting regulations in some states that if you, as a medical professional, hear of another colleague who is involved with a patient, however you hear about it, youÃ¢Â€Â™re required to report it to the licensing board. We have had a great impact in terms of change. It was a hard-fought battle and a really important one from my perspective, in thinking about the vast number of patients who were severely damaged--[creating] what we call an iatrogenic problem--caused by a medical intervention, which [in this case] was an abuse. Marine-Street: ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s just incredible to me that it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t part of the code of ethics. When did it finally get into the code of ethics? Do you know? Gartrell: [00:32:00] There were a lot of different changes to the ethics codes, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s now in the AMA Codes of Ethics. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t part of academic codes of ethics-faculty/students--either. This is all the result of the work that we did in this area [first in] psychiatry and then [in] medicine that it became something that was then [considered] in academia [concerning] faculty and students. I mean, you know, the whole concept of Ã¢Â€ÂœtheyÃ¢Â€Â™re both adults, itÃ¢Â€Â™s freedom of choice, itÃ¢Â€Â™s a consensual relationshipÃ¢Â€Â--in medicine, we know what informed consent means and I have said this very clearly since I began this work. Informed consent means you explain the risks and benefits of any [proposed treatment 109 or intervention]. I can assure you thereÃ¢Â€Â™s never been an abusing physician who has explained that Ã¢Â€Âœyou have a fifty percent chance of a severe depression, ten percent chance of psychiatric hospitalization, one percent chance of committing suicide as a result of this--your imminent sexual involvement with me. [So] letÃ¢Â€Â™s go meet at the Holiday Inn.Ã¢Â€Â I mean, does that sound likely? No. Faculty/student involvement, I mean, [itÃ¢Â€Â™s important to think about] who [holds the power]. WeÃ¢Â€Â™ve talked about the all-male or predominately male academic institutions in which I grew up. Many of those individuals themselves likely were either aware of or themselves participating in the abuse of power that we [now] know was rampant

Marine-Street: Right. I was just curious. Are there any examples that you encountered that you would be able to share regarding this physician abuse? 110 Gartrell: [00:36:25] Yes. When I was a senior resident at Harvard, I spent half of my time at Harvard Student Health Services. IÃ¢Â€Â™d only seen very, very, very mentally ill patients [in my residency education at the state hospital]. I was interested in working with healthy lesbian and gay people and helping them with their [internalized] homophobia. Having a lot of expertise in how to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder and so on really wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t going to be helpful to me in terms of dealing with healthier people with run-of-the-mill problems. I wanted to work with healthier people. I applied for and was accepted for doing part of my senior residency at Harvard Student Health Services. My supervisor there was Paul Walters. It became clear to me that he was doing something that wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t okay while I was there. This was 1979. He was an analyst. He had a sofa in his office. It was a dark blue sofa. It had stains all over it. For supervision I met in there. I sat in the chair and when all the residents met in there, we sat all around. I always was trying to get the chair rather than the sofa. [I noticed that when he saw] patients, they seemed to stay for a very long period of time. It just felt creepy. Those were my observations. I started doing the research on sex abuse by psychiatrists. We had two people from Harvard School of Public Health whom we were working with, and through other people at the Harvard School of Public Health and my networking around Harvard, I met some people who worked at the Harvard Risk Management Foundation. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a concept that is familiar to people, in general, so IÃ¢Â€Â™ll just say something about it. Basically, they managed the malpractice claims that came 111 in against Harvard doctors, which meant they shoved them under the rug as much as possible or did payoffs that were private or confidential because nobody wanted bad publicity against Harvard doctors. [00:39:23] I heard from somebody I really trusted, who was a really straight arrow person who worked with the Risk Management Foundation, that a claim had come in against Paul Walters for sexually abusing a Harvard student, having her pay him thirty-five dollars a session, I think it was, for oral sex three times a week as therapy, [and it had somehow been Ã¢Â€Âœtaken care ofÃ¢Â€Â by the Risk Management Foundation]. I was already working on sex abuse. That individual said to me, Ã¢Â€ÂœIf this comes to your attention in any other wayÃ¢Â€Â--because this was a breaking of a confidence as a person working with the Risk Management Foundation--Ã¢Â€Âœyou need to pursue it.Ã¢Â€Â Before I left Harvard, I still had some friends who were on the staff at [Harvard Student] Mental Health Services where he still was. I said to them, Ã¢Â€ÂœIf you hear anything about Paul Walters behaving sexually inappropriately with students, you need to let me know.Ã¢Â€Â Before I left Harvard to move to California in 1987, he called me. Paul Walters, out of the blue. I had had no contact with him since 1979. Oh, [actually] I had. [Colleagues and I] had done a presentation at the American Psychiatric Association on sexual abuse of patients after we had published the first paper. He was there sitting in the front row. There were a whole collection of people [in that row]. I recognized him, but there were others that none of us recognized sitting in the first row of this huge auditorium. He called me after that and he said he wanted to let me know that he was leaving 112 his position at Harvard, and he was moving to California. Where? To Stanford to become the director of Cowell Student Health Services. I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, well, why are you telling me?Ã¢Â€Â He said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, when I was out there, I mentioned that I knew you and that you were one of my supervisees and that you went to Stanford.Ã¢Â€Â Now my work had already been publicized in a big way. I mean, front page stories in the Boston Globe, the sex abuse stuff--the results of the findings. It was clear he had used me in some kind of deceitful way to help get a position at Cowell Student Health Services. I left Harvard. Moved out here. The first year I was here, I got a call from one of the social workers who was still on the faculty at Harvard [Student Health] saying they got an anonymous letter from a woman who made the same claims--$35 an hour, da da da da da. I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœThank you very much. IÃ¢Â€Â™m filing a complaint with the Massachusetts Licensing Board and the California Licensing Board. IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to inform them.Ã¢Â€Â So I did. Both began a major investigation. The story became front page news out here and in Massachusetts. He left his position at Cowell Student Health Services. He claimed that he had a substance abuse problem, and he tried to get into a diversion program which, if you get in a diversion program, they drop all charges against you--itÃ¢Â€Â™s a nifty, sneaky loophole for perpetrators. Somehow there was enough publicity around it that they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t allow him into it. He went underground and was never found again. Every few years I got a call from a San Jose Mercury news reporter who was trying to find him; [the reporter] was pretty convinced that [Walters, who] was from North 113 Carolina, had gone back [there] and changed his name and was working [there]. I actually was very fearful that my name would come out as the person who reported him to the licensing board. All I had done [was to say], Ã¢Â€ÂœThis has come to my attention. Please investigate and please contact the Harvard Risk Management Foundation and make sure you start your investigation there.Ã¢Â€Â [00:44:40] When they did, the risk management people I guess were obligated to contact Patient A who then said, Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m willing to be named,Ã¢Â€Â which was amazing. So I was never publicly [named] on any of the press about it, which I was very grateful about because I was afraid he was going to come [after me and] kill me--literally. I was afraid because we already knew that psychiatrists who took care of patients whoÃ¢Â€Â™d been abused--women psychiatrists who took care of patients who had been abused--these were colleagues and friends of mine--had their offices broken into, their offices vandalized, and their records stolen because they were encouraging and supporting these women in filing complaints. The perpetrators were trying to stop the complaints from happening by attacking the subsequent treating women psychiatrists. These were scary times. I was afraid that this guy whose misdeeds I had reported, [resulting in a huge] impact on his career, was going to come after me. Fortunately, I was not [named] by the media but the Patient A contacted me and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how you found out but itÃ¢Â€Â™s [been] life-changing for me that you did--in a positive way--and I want to thank you so much for [having done] this.Ã¢Â€Â When it was publicized in Boston, [she was] Patient A, [and subsequently] 114 Patient B, [and] Patient C [and] I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how many [others] came forward and were willing to be named on the complaint. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s one horror story. Another is the psychiatrist that my mother saw from the time she was psychiatrically hospitalized and for the next twenty-some years. He was a really creepy guy in Santa Barbara. He too became very prominent in psychiatry. He was president of the [World Association of Social Psychiatry]. His name was John Carleton. I sat outside the waiting room when she had appointments sometimes. As a teenager when I met him, he took my hand. He wanted to show me around the offices, and he kind of fondled my hand in a way that felt totally, totally cr
epy. I was a teenager who was already afraid of inappropriate behavior by men. I wanted to get my hand away, and he was fondling my hand so I was completely creeped out by this guy. I ran into him at some APA meetings, one of which when I was a resident. He got into an elevator and I was standing there with my residency training director at Harvard, and [Carleton] turned to me and he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, hi, Nanette. How nice to see you. Your mother told me to say hello.Ã¢Â€Â My mother was his patient. That is the most inappropriate thing in the world to say. That is a total breach of confidentiality. I walk out of the elevator, and my residency training director said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWho is he?Ã¢Â€Â I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœMy motherÃ¢Â€Â™s psychiatrist.Ã¢Â€Â I mean, totally embarrassing to me that that had happened. IÃ¢Â€Â™d been doing [sex abuse] research. I was already out here. My mother called me a few years after I [moved to San Francisco]. It actually was in the early 1990s. I was working on a big fundraiser for our lesbian health services here 115 in San Francisco, and I had created an idea of a fundraiser that was really successful. I was driving back across the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a time when we had a car phone, and she called me. I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI really canÃ¢Â€Â™t talk right now. IÃ¢Â€Â™m on the bridge.Ã¢Â€Â She said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI have something I have to tell you. I know youÃ¢Â€Â™ve been doing all this work all this time [meaning, on sexual abuse] and I know that you never liked Dr. Carleton.Ã¢Â€Â She wanted to tell me--she felt like she had to tell me--that she had been sexually involved with him and when she told him that the relationship needed to stop, he had raped her. She also said, Ã¢Â€ÂœHe also encouraged me to kill your father.Ã¢Â€Â I was just horrified at all this. Ã¢Â€ÂœHe encouraged me when we went out sailing to push him overboard. That was before he raped me, before I told him I canÃ¢Â€Â™t keep seeing him.Ã¢Â€Â [00:49:42] I contacted the California Licensing Board. He had meanwhile married a patient. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how many patients he--I think there were stories of multiple patients--I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how many he married, but he married at least one. The only thing I could think of to do was to contact, again, the California Licensing Board, and I sent them this complaint. I asked my mother if sheÃ¢Â€Â™d be willing to be named on the complaint. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember the circumstances exactly. She had gone through this complicated decision-making process but I said to them, Ã¢Â€ÂœYouÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to open a file on him. If you get any other complaints, you really need to do something about it.Ã¢Â€Â 116 The third story led to my resignation publicly from the American Psychiatric Association in 1989, during the time that all these women psychiatrists and mental health professionals were providing reparative, supportive therapy to victims of abuse by male typically psychiatrists and other physicians. The APAÃ¢Â€Â™s malpractice carrier was beginning to realize that they were going to be losing tons of money on these claims. This is before we started our work in this area. They were paying claims based on sexual abuse. Now you canÃ¢Â€Â™t get any kind of insurance--malpractice coverage--that would cover your sexually abusing a patient. Then they were paying. One of the things that was really a problem for them is that subsequent treating psychiatrists were helping these patients file complaints, which means that the claims were continuing to rise and they were continuing to lose money. They started going after these subsequent treating psychiatrists with character assassination. One of those cases involved this phenomenally strong woman psychiatrist in Colorado whose name is Martha Gay. She was treating a patient who had been sexually abused by a psychiatrist. The establishment came after Martha Gay to character assassinate her and further character assassinate the patient who had filed a claim against her abusing [male] psychiatrist. It was an appalling situation. I went all in in support of Dr. Gay, and I publicly resigned from the APA over the [attempt to malign her character]. That story ended up being a FRONTLINE documentary. I talked about that resignation in the FRONTLINE documentary. Those are just some examples, [and that episode illustrated how one] moved 117 into very dangerous territory [when] working with individuals who were seeking restitution from abuse. Marine-Street: What was the response to the FRONTLINE documentary? Gartrell: [00:53:28] Personally, for my part, I got a lot of positive feedback from people who said how brave I was to take on the APA and to speak out against the APA. The APA accepted my resignation like that [snaps fingers]. Things are different now, but these were very bad times then

 Marine-Street: You also mentioned in the other interview that you had kind of a traumatic childhood. In your papers that are at Smith College, you have a biographical statement that you wrote. In it you talk about some instances of sexual violence that happened. I wonder if you'd be willing to just talk a little bit about those. Gartrell: [00:04:30] When I was six years old, we lived next door to a physician who had three sons. One of them was a teenager. He and a friend of his lured me and my brother over to their treehouse and said, "Wouldn't you like to come see our treehouse?" He said, "You go up first"  to me and I started climbing, and I said, "Come on, Greg" [to my brother]. And he [the neighbor] said, "No, no, you wait down there." They wouldn't let him up. They got me up there, and they had a .22 rifle and they pointed the rifle at me and demanded that I engage in sexual activity with them, which I don't think there's a point in describing, but it was phenomenally traumatic. I thought that they were going to kill me, and they threatened to come get me if I told anyone. What happened afterwards was I got down, and I burst into tears and ran to my home. My mother and father were both home at the time. My father examined me physically, which was further embarrassing, and then went over and screamed at the neighbors and told them he was calling the police. Then they consulted--I don't know whom--who said that it would be very traumatic for me to go to court to testify against these boys, and it was better just to leave [it as it was, with] whatever threat my father made against them. We lived in that house for another year and a half. I was terrified every single day. I was terrified every single night. I was afraid they were going to crawl into my window. I actually was terrified throughout the rest of my childhood about the prospect of being raped or assaulted after that incident. Marine-Street: Were there any ramifications for the assaulters? Gartrell: [00:06:35] None whatsoever. When we moved to a new home far across town from where they lived, there was an unfortunate response on my mothers part to a question I asked in a veiled way, hoping that it wouldn't be obvious why I was asking the question. I said to her, "Do you think there's any chance those neighbors know where we live now?" She said, "Oh, of course, I'm sure they know," which just took away any feeling of safety that I could have had at this new home. Marine-Street: Did you get any kind of counseling or help? Gartrell: [00:07:13] No. 18 Marine-Street: What did they call what happened to you in those days? Gartrell: [00:07:22] Teenage boys acting badly. Marine-Street: Has your understanding of that changed over time? Gartrell: [00:07:32] It was sexual violence at gunpoint and very, very, very traumatic.

Marine-Street: You also mentioned to me that you almost were kidnapped. Was that about that same time? Gartrell: [00:07:48] It was a few years later. We lived next to a lemon orchard. Our house backed up against the lemon orchard. We were not a family of means. We lived in a small track house in Santa Barbara. Our school bus dropped us off about, I would say, a fifteen-minute walk from my home. I had seen a car that followed the school bus frequently, and it was an old man driving an old car. On most days when we were dropped off, there were many of us children. On this particular day, I was the only one. I got off the bus, and I was walking in a fairly leisurely way next to the lemon orchard to my home. This car pulled up next to me, and he rolled down his window, and he said, "You need to get in. You need to get in." He looked very frightening to me, and I started running, and he started following me. There was enough room where he could follow me off the road. I started screaming and running, and I ran through the lemon orchard [so] he couldn't take his car through the lemon orchard. I got into my house the back way and went into my room and looked out the window, and I saw that he was cruising by trying to find me. I told my parents. They then called the police and they allegedly looked for this person, but I [often] saw the car [parked] within a mile of our home and no one ever apprehended 19 the person. It was another instance in which, again, there was a complete lack of feeling safe. Marine-Street: What did you do as a child after those instances to kind of make yourself feel safe? Gartrell: [00:09:57] I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t feel safe. I felt frightened all the time. I felt frightened in my home, outside of my home. I was always afraid of being raped. I was always afraid of being assaulted. Marine-Street: How can you function if you're always afraid? Gartrell: [00:10:12] There are a lot of things that contributed to fear in my life and my parents unfortunately were not psychologically healthy. There was major mental illness in my family so I had that factor contributing to my state of not feeling safe. My father had severe panic disorder, and he was pretty much afraid of the world and afraid of going anywhere. When you have a role model of one parent who is afraid of the world and another parent who was quite mentally ill in a different way, it's not an environment in which a child grows up being given an opportunity to feel safe. On top of that, I then had teachers who hit on me before I left for college. For instance, when I was a tenth grade student, I had a Latin teacher who said to me he wanted to start driving me home. I thought that I needed to comply with that, [but when I] told my father and mother, they said, "Well, he can come here and meet us, but he's not driving you home." He touched me in ways that were very creepy. Touched my body and his hands were not where they should be. I mean, here I was doing well academically and having somebody trying to paw me and trying to drive me home.

Martin: [00:44:10] No. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think they really did, although having Francine Hall and Myra Strober hired five years before, even though both had left the school, they did a lot to break the ice on the most egregious sins. The Business School faculty never sexually harassed me in any way. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have people jumping on me.

Tracy: Besides meeting women through lectures and talks at Clayman, were there other gathering points for women organizationally? Martin: [01:48:33] We had the female faculty caucus. As a result of first presenting the pay data, a lot of women called me to help them think through what they should do. I met a lot of women all over campus through that. Then I co-led the faculty caucus, and that brought other issues to the fore other than pay. Cecilia and I in particular took on Condi Rice (provost) on a number of those issues. We played the role of loyal to Stanford, but still in opposition on some issues. Then in the faculty senate, I was out there doing a lot of different things, not all to do with women. I got known. Then that got me elected. [01:49:32] I started getting elected to things like the Faculty Advisory Board. It just progressed. It wasn't solely, but it was heavily driven by getting to know women all over campus on the faculty. That was nice because I didn't know too many here in the Business School. We were so busy. [laughter] 64 There wasn't a lot of just social stuff. We did get together over dinner two or three times a year and it was mainly the Clayman Institute group. We'd get together for dinner and drinks and talk and stuff. We had a lot of one-on-one meetings. On an average week, I'd probably have lunch with other women two times, three times. [01:50:32] Sometimes a woman I didn't know needed advice on something, sometimes a woman who had been raped or harassed sexually, a faculty woman, and sometimes just a friend or a friend of a friend. Tracy: Since you mentioned sexual harassment, in the mid 1990s, the sexual harassment policy went through some revisions. There were a lot of questions around liability and confidentiality. Do you have a memory of that policy being revised in the mid 1990s, or your sense of the problem? Because obviously you were hearing about--. Martin: [01:51:25] When I was the only woman faculty in the GSB--. If you were raped in the Business School -- student, faculty - -who would you come to on the faculty? So I did a lot of that kind of counseling then. The university ombudsman put complaints about certain faculty "in the drawer." There were complaints about some people over the years that were never acted on. The actual policy arguments were something I spoke up about in the faculty senate, but I wasn't a primary person on that. Tracy: Considering your position and being one of the only women, what was your sense of how prevalent sexual assault and sexual harassment were? Did you see a change in that over the years? 65 Martin: [01:52:34] When I came I was really visible because I was the only one in the Business School. People came to me from all over campus, freshmen even, in tears, "I was a virgin. I got raped." Over time, the university began to respond on the undergraduate level by having a widespread network of people who did that kind of counseling. I was very glad to get out of that business. At the doctoral and postdoctoral and the faculty level, the retaliation and repercussions of complaining are really career-sensitive, particularly if you came to Stanford to work with one person in a very narrow field, and that person's going to be writing your recommendations until the day he dies. Saying no to some of those people, they immediately would withdraw support from you. An offer to talk on a panel at a conference or contribute a chapter to a book suddenly disappears. It's a hint that you better find someone else to write your letter of recommendation. Whether you're going to actually take that complaint up through the university hierarchy when that person's been doing this for years and has always gotten away with it, that's a very tough decision for a victim, and I found it awkward. I don't want to talk about this much more because every time someone comes to you, you're supposed to report it to the administration. Some
of those cases, they would never have talked to me if they thought I would report it. They really needed to talk to somebody. I didn't have pat answers because those people are damned if they do and damned if they don't. We could talk more about what if this, and what if that, but like any good counselor, I wouldn't tell someone what to do in a situation like that. I've been actively involved in that. By the time the policy 66 came through I spoke up, and I spoke up in the senate, and I think it had an effect on some issues. Over time, the most important aspects of that policy did get revised, sometimes better, sometimes worse. I was just one of many at that point.

Tracy: Besides meeting women through lectures and talks at Clayman, were there other gathering points for women organizationally? Martin: [01:48:33] We had the female faculty caucus. As a result of first presenting the pay data, a lot of women called me to help them think through what they should do. I met a lot of women all over campus through that. Then I co-led the faculty caucus, and that brought other issues to the fore other than pay. Cecilia and I in particular took on Condi Rice (provost) on a number of those issues. We played the role of loyal to Stanford, but still in opposition on some issues. Then in the faculty senate, I was out there doing a lot of different things, not all to do with women. I got known. Then that got me elected. [01:49:32] I started getting elected to things like the Faculty Advisory Board. It just progressed. It wasn't solely, but it was heavily driven by getting to know women all over campus on the faculty. That was nice because I didn't know too many here in the Business School. We were so busy.

Oh, yes. I could certainly see in fact, in the years that I worked, we would have workshops and lessons on dealing with drug interaction. That was a big one, what foods to eat, what not to eat and what to do on those. So, it works together. And because of this now, the specialists at OSU provide such excellent training to the county personnel, they have the information. They re not digging out so much basic stuff as we did many years ago. They have more research-based information and that s the whole purpose, research-based information. Was there a time you did child abuse? Yes, oh yes, that s another thing I do. I serve as president of Canadian County Court-Appointed Special Advocates. We have that program here in our county where children that are taken away from the home, that are in foster care, need an advocate for them. So, I have been an advocate. Now I serve as the board president for that. That child needs someone, needs a voice, and so we have interaction there with children that have been neglected and abused, and Canadian County is fortunate. We have a CART (Child Abuse Response Team) house, I don t know that every county has one, not very many do, in which we have up to date information on researching a child that has been sexually abused, making it the most comfortable position for that child to go through that program. So, Canadian County is fortunate there, to have that excellent material. It doesn t sound like you ve retired. (Laughs) Probably not. People, people, people. Yes, it is that way.

We still want that program, that&#8217;s still important to all of us, but we really need something to address this incredible level of stress that&#8217;s going on in this community, particularly violence against women, so intimate partner violence. All kinds of violence [were] increasing.&#8221; This is what they told us, and then the stress of not knowing what&#8217;s going to happen. People were called in to where they actually got waders, rubber boots, to go in and shovel mud and muck out of their factories so that people could get back to work. So we went, those of us working at the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, we called the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which was our funding agency, and we said, &#8220;Look. We&#8217;ve got this big issue here. We don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221; They brought down some leaders and we took them on a tour of eastern North Carolina and they met people who were affected by the flood and they saw areas that were affected by the flood, spent a day just talking to people, and they went back and found, they call it &#8220;shopping money&#8221; in grantsmanship, and they found a piece of money. Part of it was from the injury prevention, which focused on violence against women, and we got a grant, another grant to add on to our Health Works for Women/Health Works in the Community grant, and we called it Health Works After the Flood. In that one we added a big component on stress, on post-traumatic stress&#8211;-which a lot of people had in eastern North Carolina&#8211;-post-traumatic stress, stress in the workplace, intimate partner violence prevention, training managers and people in the workplace to recognize signs with women, working really closely with the local domestic violence agencies, particularly one called U Care in Clinton, in Sampson County. [We] became very close with the women who worked in that women&#8217;s shelter and women&#8217;s center, and focused for the next three years, in addition to the healthy eating and the exercise, focused&#8211;-and then the stress management that we were doing, which we were teaching great skills like deep breathing and all kinds of ways to manage your stress, but this was another whole level. So we did that project for three years, and we put on Women&#8217;s Empowerment Days at the local community colleges, and that was a turning point, those Women&#8217;s Empowerment Days, because&#8211;. MK: What exactly were those? I&#8217;m sorry for interrupting. [Laughs] SB: That&#8217;s fine. Those were&#8211;-. So the community advisors were telling us&#8211;-. This is the thing about community based participatory research. The people in the community a lot of times don&#8217;t want to do what the researchers in Chapel Hill want to do. We might say we want to do smoking cessation because smoking is the leading cause of death and you have a big smoking problem in this community. And they might say, &#8220;Well, sure, we know smoking&#8217;s bad for us, but we&#8217;re not really interested in quitting smoking and we don&#8217;t believe in pushing it,&#8221; and they did say that to us. What they said was &#8220;What we&#8217;re interested in&#8221;&#8211;-and this is when it first came up-&#8211;&#8220;is economic development.&#8221; And we went&#8211;-. I mean it&#8217;s what we did when we heard from the community about intimate partner violence. We said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have that experience.&#8221; So we brought in researchers from UNC who were experts on intimate partner violence and we connected with the domestic violence agencies. So with the economic piece we were like, &#8220;Okay, well we have resources at UNC. We have lots of people at the business school in various kinds of development efforts who know about the economic piece and some of the things that we could do.&#8221; So we put on this day where we had part of the day, I mean throughout the day, we served only healthy food. We had exercise breaks. We had stress management and nutrition workshops. But we also had people come in from the unemployment office and have a table there with stuff about jobs. We had people come in from the&#8211;. We were in the community college but they had a table telling women how to go back to school and get your GED, how to go back to school and get a degree. Then the domestic violence agency had a thrift shop and we had a fashion show with clothes that they had that you could use: &#8220;Look, this ensemble is only three dollars and you could wear this for a job interview.&#8221; So we combined the economic piece and the health piece for the first time. We did those two Women&#8217;s Empowerment Days, one in Duplin County at James Sprunt Community College and one in Sampson County at Sampson Community College. Being researchers, we wrote an evaluation form for all the women. Oh, and for that Women&#8217;s Empowerment Day, women who were on welfare&#8211;-Work First&#8211;-had to show that they were looking for a job, and they got to come to that day&#8211;-. It was all free. We didn&#8217;t charge anybody anything. They got to come to that day and count it [as looking] for a job because there were people there talking about jobs and getting a job, and they walked in&#8211;-there was a whole group of them&#8211;-and they were walking in and they looked like they were really pissed off that they had to be here. I&#8217;m always the one that taught the exercise breaks, so we were doing an exercise break, we have music on, we have pictures of them laughing. At the end of the day they were like, &#8220;This was great! What a wonderful day!&#8221; And that was the first time that our projects ever combined, as I said, the economic piece and the health piece.

MK: Were you ever part of the HOPE Circles? SB: Well, yeah, sure. I mean, they were in eastern North Carolina. We did the training. We went and trained the circle leaders and then I would get invited to do the exercise component, physical activity, then I would go and do a more&#8211;-. We would sit in for some of it. Yeah. MK: What was that like? Do you remember anything in particular that stood out to you? SB: Well, what women always say when women get together like that, is how empowering it is. In the very, very beginning with consciousness-raising, the phrase was &#8220;personal is political,&#8221; and that is an incredible statement. I remember in the late &#8217;60s feeling that, &#8220;You mean I&#8217;m not the only one? I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s felt this way?&#8221; And guess what? It&#8217;s not just about an individual woman. It&#8217;s a whole system. I think these HOPE Circles did the same thing for women, where they would get together and they would say, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve had this problem with the banks too. They&#8217;ve treated me this way.&#8221; So what can we do with banks to help, because banks discriminate against low income women, right? So there was that, and then there was the sharing of the personal stories. A lot of women have stories, sad stories of abuse, rape, violence. Many, many women have been battered and they would share those and we would hear about that. I know there was one leader training that I was [at] with Marci Campbell and me&#8211;-Marci was the PI of the projects&#8211;-and we were all crying because women were talking about these stories. But for them, then they would say, &#8220;It&#8217;s so wonderful to have a place to go and be able to say whatever you want to say and not be judged for it.&#8221; There was a vow of confidentiality in the circles, and that was one of the major ground rules, is nothing goes out of the circle. So it was powerful in many ways, and it&#8217;s hard to quantify that kind of thing with surveys, but then with the qualitative piece where women can say what it&#8217;s meant to them, it&#8217;s powerful. MK: Absolutely. SB: Yeah. So I do want to say that Marci Campbell was&#8211;-. She was just getting her PhD in 1993 and she was on the project from the beginning and she was a brilliant woman. She was the principal investigator and I was the project manager and then the project director for these projects over sixteen or seventeen years, and just a couple months after I retired she died of colon cancer. She was fifty-nine. So all of these projects really-&#8211;. Her thumbprint is on all of them. She really supported them and she and I had so many great ideas together and with the team of women that we had at UNC and then the team of women in eastern North Carolina--with those two teams we had what we called power team meetings every week or two for like a half a day. We would go and we would hash things out and do the wo
k. We would always go to eastern North Carolina and work with the women there to run the projects. Then we had community advisory or community action council meetings once a month, also in eastern North Carolina, and we would have dinner meetings and we would go through the work of the projects and get ideas from them. It was an amazing experience to work with all the people in eastern North Carolina that I worked with. MK: So you said those are like the consciousness-raising groups that you were a part of earlier&#8211;- SB: Yeah. MK: &#8211;-and when you were talking about that earlier I really wanted to ask you what they were like. Can you--? SB: Well, let me see if I can remember, because it&#8217;s a long time ago. I remember we would sit together and we would often have a topic, and topics would be your parents, or how you were raised to think about sports, sex. I know I remember one evening it was about sexual abuse, and I had not thought about it since I was a child, but when I was twelve I was abused by a friend of my mom and dad&#8217;s, and it was horrible. It was traumatic. I had repressed it, and because we were talking about it in this group I remembered it, but I didn&#8217;t remember-&#8211;. I wasn&#8217;t ashamed of it anymore because every single woman in the group, every one, had either been raped or abused in some way, every woman. One friend of mine was talking about she was hitchhiking in her hometown and this guy that she knew picked her up and raped her, and I don&#8217;t think she even reported it. But it was everybody, so that&#8217;s such a good example of &#8220;the personal is political,&#8221; because when women are abused or raped, often we are ashamed of ourselves and we hide it, and my parents certainly never-&#8211;. I never told my parents. I never opened my mouth. I just turned into this really angry little girl for a couple of years and I hated my mother, because part of the way that I was raised in those days, adults were right and children weren&#8217;t. You respected adults and you weren&#8217;t taught, like kids are now, that it&#8217;s okay to tell if someone does something. But that was that meeting that night that I remembered it and I went through&#8211;-. It raised my consciousness about women and about experience. MK: That&#8217;s really powerful. SB: It was really powerful, and I don&#8217;t remember all of the-&#8211;. I do remember processing whether or not I was going to have an abortion with my first child, and I actually knew I wasn&#8217;t going to. I mean I was happily married and I always wanted children and I didn&#8217;t get pregnant on purpose, but I remember talking about that. There are things I want-&#8211;. And you&#8217;re weighing it, it was an option, but then I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have the baby. I want this baby.&#8221; But it was like there wasn&#8217;t anything you couldn&#8217;t talk about, and that was the first time in my life, Mary, that I could talk without feeling ashamed of things.

SB: So after Hurricane Floyd we called together our community advisors. It was in Goldsboro, in Wayne County, and we were at a Mexican restaurant, and we actually have a picture of that first meeting. So these are like maybe twelve people who we&#8217;d been&#8211;. They&#8217;d been helping us figure out how to start this program and how to recruit the industries and everything, and then the flood happened and we said to them, &#8220;How can we help? What can we do?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We&#8217;re really concerned about&#8211;-. We&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of stories about violence, particularly child abuse and intimate partner violence. We&#8217;ve just anecdotally been hearing these stories.&#8221; And we said, I mentioned, &#8220;We are not experts on that area, but we certainly have resources at UNC to bring in, and what could we do? We can still work through the workplaces, because there&#8217;s thousands of women in the workplaces, and there are great programs about domestic violence coming to work.&#8221; Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that rare for a boyfriend or a husband to stalk his wife or girlfriend at work or the parking lot, guns and things like that. So that&#8217;s where we were able to bring in people from UNC, women from UNC, and bring in the local domestic violence agencies to help us figure out how to do these programs, and some of the stories that women would say about the inequality in their relationships, like focus groups

But for them, then they would say, &#8220;It&#8217;s so wonderful to have a place to go and be able to say whatever you want to say and not be judged for it.&#8221; There was a vow of confidentiality in the circles, and that was one of the major ground rules, is nothing goes out of the circle.

SB: Well, let me see if I can remember, because it&#8217;s a long time ago. I remember we would sit together and we would often have a topic, and topics would be your parents, or how you were raised to think about sports, sex. I know I remember one evening it was about sexual abuse, and I had not thought about it since I was a child, but when I was twelve I was abused by a friend of my mom and dad&#8217;s, and it was horrible. It was traumatic. I had repressed it, and because we were talking about it in this group I remembered it, but I didn&#8217;t remember-&#8211;. I wasn&#8217;t ashamed of it anymore because every single woman in the group, every one, had either been raped or abused in some way, every woman. One friend of mine was talking about she was hitchhiking in her hometown and this guy that she knew picked her up and raped her, and I don&#8217;t think she even reported it. But it was everybody, so that&#8217;s such a good example of &#8220;the personal is political,&#8221; because when women are abused or raped, often we are ashamed of ourselves and we hide it, and my parents certainly never-&#8211;. I never told my parents. I never opened my mouth. I just turned into this really angry little girl for a couple of years and I hated my mother, because part of the way that I was raised in those days, adults were right and children weren&#8217;t. You respected adults and you weren&#8217;t taught, like kids are now, that it&#8217;s okay to tell if someone does something. But that was that meeting that night that I remembered it and I went through&#8211;-. It raised my consciousness about women and about experience. MK: That&#8217;s really powerful. SB: It was really powerful, and I don&#8217;t remember all of the-&#8211;. I do remember processing whether or not I was going to have an abortion with my first child, and I actually knew I wasn&#8217;t going to. I mean I was happily married and I always wanted children and I didn&#8217;t get pregnant on purpose, but I remember talking about that. There are things I want-&#8211;. And you&#8217;re weighing it, it was an option, but then I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have the baby. I want this baby.&#8221; But it was like there wasn&#8217;t anything you couldn&#8217;t talk about, and that was the first time in my life, Mary, that I could talk without feeling ashamed of things.

 They said, &#8220;We&#8217;re really concerned about&#8211;-. We&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of stories about violence, particularly child abuse and intimate partner violence. We&#8217;ve just anecdotally been hearing these stories.&#8221; And we said, I mentioned, &#8220;We are not experts on that area, but we certainly have resources at UNC to bring in, and what could we do? We can still work through the workplaces, because there&#8217;s thousands of women in the workplaces, and there are great programs about domestic violence coming to work.&#8221; Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that rare for a boyfriend or a husband to stalk his wife or girlfriend at work or the parking lot, guns and things like that. So that&#8217;s where we were able to bring in people from UNC, women from UNC, and bring in the local domestic violence agencies to help us figure out how to do these programs, and some of the stories that women would say about the inequality in their relationships, like focus groups

RJ: Oh gosh, I wish I knew. It was in the [19]70s. And one of my jobs at Child and Family Services in Knoxville was problem pregnancy referrals. If you were pregnant, you could come to me, and we would decide in the counseling sessions. The goal was for the female to really help her decide what she wanted to do with the pregnancy, what kind of resources were available, how to get to the health department, how to get birth control, how to get good medical care, prenatal care. At that time, the advent of getting vitamins and don&#8217;t smoke and those kinds of things were just coming on the horizon. I did a lot of reading. So in that job, that&#8217;s what I did. But of course, you couldn&#8217;t get a termination of a pregnancy here in Tennessee. I helped get a lot of airline and bus tickets to New York and Washington. At the time, I think they were the only two places, as I recall. Again, I know New York was the big, the most available state for termination of a pregnancy if that&#8217;s what you wanted to do. And so that position really catapulted me into really advocating for women. I was not as active on the local level, but I joined NOW and all those good old great ones and became a real advocate for not just social workers, but women in those positions, women in the field. So that&#8217;s been my focus all these years. I&#8217;m a very verbal person, and so I made lots of speeches when I was with-the next program that I worked in in Child and Family was the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. So that included, as I shared with you on the phone, I think, that agency had sort of a research project that started with setting up a helpline in 1979. The helpline was for women and children to call in and report just to the helpline or just to talk about their abuse, primarily sexual abuse was the target. And that meant any women that had been sexually abused as a child or were still or had been raped or a child that had been molested or somehow been offended sexually. So that sort of experiment or, in research terms, sort of out there to gather data, that following next year, the referrals to the Department of Human Services went up four hundred percent. So that data was used to support getting the funding for a regional research and service delivery system for abuse victims and so that&#8217;s where the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. It&#8217;s an unwieldy name, but PASAAC, and I was clinical supervisor there for six years. So I did a lot of speaking at that time throughout the southeast. And what we did was try to get the various parts of the systems that deal with abuse to talk to each other. Police-if a rape was reported, how do they talk to the victim? What kind of services were available at the emergency center, the emergency rooms? Of course, the Department of Human Services that gave services to children, often they weren&#8217;t communicating with anybody. The sheriff&#8217;s department, the police, all of those people needed to coordinate services and learn how to not do further damage because the interrogation, particularly around rape, man, it was almost as bad as the rape sometimes for women. So we advocated strongly for that to change and for a more humane, more private inquiry, and did a lot of training throughout the southeast all the way from Texas to South Carolina, Florida. JW: Was there openness to that kind of change or what was that process like? RJ: What was that process? (laughs) Well, the big resistance, you can imagine, was from [males].We wanted to include doctors and many physicians would not, were the most resistant group. And I&#8217;m not sure why that was. I think a lot of that was because there weren&#8217;t very many women physicians at that point. And I think that, number one, a lot of men had not been trained to really see rape as [a crime]. They saw it as, well, did she have any injuries, was she pregnant, and that&#8217;s it, and not any of the psychological impact of being assaulted that way. JW: Were you trying to get them to report cases? RJ: Yes, definitely trying to get, well, trying to help them help the victim, to take charge, and to talk about it. A lot of women still won&#8217;t talk about being raped because back then, of course, there was very anti-female [attitude]. First of all, rape didn&#8217;t exist. Number two, if you were raped, you asked for it, you wanted it, because you wore that skirt too short or you were being seductive or you didn&#8217;t say &#8220;no&#8221; loud enough. Why did you finally give in? Nobody can [be raped]. It was a lot of old boy things: &#8220;Well, nobody gets raped. If you don&#8217;t want to have sex then you just say no.&#8221; But the fact that the man was two hundred and fifty pounds and the woman was a hundred had nothing to do with it. So there was a lot of denial of inequities, physical strength and intimidation, and then the women often felt so guilty and so dirty. All she wanted to do was forget it, and so there was not much follow-up for the mental health [treatment]. So as the next project that I worked on, as clinic supervisor at the Sexual Assault Center, which was an agency designed specifically to work with women and children. [The] women that had been sexually assaulted or had been sexually abused as children and were still dealing with the trauma. So I ran a group for nine years for women that had been sexually assaulted or had reoccurring memories. The whole memory thing got really to be an issue. And then, of course, I had staff that worked with children that had been abused, a lot of play therapy and those kinds of things. JW: And what year did you start that? RJ: Oh gosh. I left Child and Family in &#8217;86-no, I started in private practice in &#8217;86. I left Child and Family in &#8217;84. I went with Overlook Mental Health Center for a couple years and then I went in private practice. And when I went in private practice in &#8217;86, then that&#8217;s when I associated also with the Sexual Assault Center. There was three of us on staff, four on staff at the time and so I was the clinical supervisor and then we started adding staff. I was there for fifteen years on some level. JW: So how were you learning to counsel people through this when, like you said, rape didn&#8217;t exist? You were part of that movement to say, &#8220;Wait a second. It does.&#8221; RJ: It does exist and it has more than physical impact on the victim. Well, how were we learning that? Well, learning how to be a counselor, quote, therapist. Counseling usually is around solving problems, defining problems and solving problems in a real sort of one, two, three way. That&#8217;s my definition. Now therapy is a much longer and more in-depth look at how you reacted to the problem on an emotional level and what that did to your mental health. What has it done? Do you find yourself depressed, staying in bed all day long, or continuing to get into self-destructive, abusive relationships? That takes a long time to figure out how to break those patterns and we&#8217;re now learning a whole lot more about the brain. If I had time to go, I&#8217;d be a neurologist. I would study that and how to educate people to train their brain differently. We know that can happen now. We have the technology, and we have the expertise. But anyway, back to how do you learn how to deal with somebody about a behavior or an event that supposedly doesn&#8217;t happen. (laughs) Well, the first thing you do is say, &#8220;It does happen.&#8221; And again, since we&#8217;re products of our culture, you have to do a lot of work on yourself, or at least I did, in saying, &#8220;Yeah, that happens and yes, it&#8217;s not good and yes, most of the victims are women, but also little boys get raped and vulnerable males also get raped.&#8221; So you have to sort of retrain your own thinking about that and disconnect yourself from the common belief system. It has some service in the community to deny certain things and so you have to figure out, okay, if I rock the boat, what happens? What role do I play? It&#8217;s like the whole thing with women, the women&#8217;s movement. There was this thought that women, you can have it all. You can&#8217;t have it all. You have to make choices. You can&#8217;t be the CEO of a multimillion-dollar corporation and be there every time your kid has a fever. You can&#8217;t do it. So you make choices.

RJ: Well, how has it been slow to change? JW: Or has it been? Has this mostly been a positive story of success? RJ: Well, in some ways for some people it has. I think there&#8217;s still a lot of, and I&#8217;m thinking of just a great influence on people&#8217;s attitudes on sex generally and then, concomitant of that, the misuse of sex to control somebody, which is essentially [abuse]. Rape is not about sex. It&#8217;s about violence and control, because if you want to have good sex, you don&#8217;t rape. And sexual overtures to a child essentially, those people, in my humble opinion, do not have power any place else or they don&#8217;t feel powerful in any place else. So it&#8217;s not about the use of your sexual self for pleasure or for connection. It&#8217;s about violence, psychological violence if not physical violence, on another person. So how have we changed? I&#8217;m not so sure that television and popular media doesn&#8217;t sometimes glorify non-consensual sex and it certainly, I don&#8217;t think, creates enough distaste for prostitution and those areas that females get entrapped maybe. I know that some of your audience would probably say, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s choice there too.&#8221; Anyway, so we&#8217;ve both been changing toward appreciation for the individual and individual choice and for women, but we&#8217;ve also degraded, to some degree, the whole process of sexuality and made it entertainment and/or a power play. It&#8217;s kind of sad in a lot of ways. I&#8217;m at the age where I don&#8217;t want to sound like a curmudgeon and blah blah blah blah, the world&#8217;s going to the dogs, but I have spent my whole career, adult life, advocating for women and for choice and for equality in all arenas. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve got there yet. What is real discouraging at times is to see women who get power and also become abusive and not nice, not helpful, not nurturing. We know of those folks. That&#8217;s really sad. So maybe it&#8217;s the power in the human family that&#8217;s the culprit, not necessarily discrimination based on male-female, but it&#8217;s on the power group versus the un-empowered. It&#8217;s possible for us to destroy ourselves as a species. So have we made progress? I don&#8217;t know, but the human community is very slow. Again, I think our brain is slow to change. And once we get an idea, it&#8217;s very hard to change back and say, &#8220;Hmm, maybe, maybe the best place for children is not eight to ten hours a day in daycare.&#8221;

Well did anyone take you under their wing? Oh, yes. Yes. I had tremendous help. Representative Mike Fair, he s a republican, but he was a tremendous help to me. Representative Charles Gray was a big help. Most of the other representatives from south Oklahoma City tried to help me. Frank Shurden representative he was a representative then he later became a senator and so did Mike Fair, he became a senator later. They both tried to help me. Of course I met my husband here and he didn t exactly take me under his wing, but we certainly formed an alliance, I would say. We ve been married a quarter of a century (Laughs) and raised two kids. I remember my first bill was a bill legalizing it made rape by instrumentation against the law, which had not been illegal before, and it made it illegal for a man to rape his wife. Well, that s kind of a 9 Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton bombshell to put out on back then, those were really controversial ideas, very much so. I can imagine. So I talked to the different legislators about it and they were all men that I was talking to about it and said, I don t know what to do and I m scared to go and I was, I was. You don t know what it s like standing up on that floor. There s a world of difference between watching a car wreck and being in one and standing up on that floor is a lot different when you re actually the one holding that mic. I mean, it is scary and they all come at you and ask you questions. They can really make you look like a fool, which is something most people fear a great deal. I told them, I said, I don t know what I m going to do. I don t We sat up here one night late trying to figure out how to help me pass that bill. And what we did, and I ve never told anyone this but I don t think he would mind now, I had another bill doing something or the other I don t remember what and they were both out on the floor. And Frank Shurden said, Well, what we ll do is I m going to amend your bill to put my castration bill in it, and then there s going to be this huge fight. He said, Then you run your bill making spousal rape against the law right after that, and they ll be so exhausted from the fight over the castration bill, they ll just pass it and never even notice what they ve done. There were about four or five of us who were involved in this genius plan, and that s exactly what we did and it worked. And it worked? And it worked. When I got the thing through the House, I couldn t find a Senate author to save myself. They would not touch it, and finally Frank Keating stepped up. I ll never forget that. He was a senator at that tim
, and I had been through everybody in both parties, and I went to Frank and he said I still remember this because this was my first bill and I was a scared kid and he said, Of course I ll help you. What you re doing is right and it needs to be done and, yes, I will help you. I have never ever forgotten that about Frank Keating and so anyway yeah, I had a lot of help. Has it gotten any easier to do bills on the floor? No, it s much harder now. Oh, you mean handling things Yes. on the mic and stuff? Yes, it s easier. I know what to do. It s always 10 Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton scary when you stand up. You never know what s going to happen on that floor, but no, I don t get petrified before I handle a bill on the floor anymore, if that s what you re asking. Have you had any other bills that just stick out the ones you re proudest of? Well, I was the original author of the Protective Order here in Oklahoma. It took me two years to pass that back in the day and the major reason why is because it took me that long to get the chips to pass it. That was a big coup because that was just unthinkable to pass that here. That, I guess, and my first I also got this capacity hotline for rape victims here in Oklahoma. I got the funding it wasn t a piece of legislation, but I got the funding to set up the first statewide it was five pilot programs around the state for adult daycare. Okay. And I was one of the people who worked on nursing home reform, and back then nursing homes really, really, really needed reforming. Then when I came back, I ve done a lot of things in my second go-around that I m really proud of, too. Can you tell us about those? Well, I remarked earlier that I was pro-choice in my first time in office. Well then I had a very powerful religious conversion, and when I came back I was pro-life which has been the source of a great deal of controversy surrounding me. As part of that process, I was the primary author of the House Bill 1686 in 2005. That was the bill that broke the log jam. There was a 30-year log jam on pro-life legislation, and getting that through changed that. Now a big part of that change was the republican takeover of the House. It changed the climate quite a bit, too but it took all of us. I think that s something that people don t realize. We desperately need both parties to be working together on things that matter and not trying to shoot each other down all the time. That s terrible for the people, terrible for the country. I passed that. Let s see I passed a bill saying that you couldn t put rape victims private information on the Internet, which I thought was very important. I passed another pro-life bill, and both of these bills required informed consent before abortion. They required parental consent for minors. The first bill said that if you murder a pregnant woman you can be charged with the death of the baby as well as the death of the woman. Then the second bill basically dealt with funding and some of those issues. I passed that. There again, that was actually Representative John Wright s 11 Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton bill, but in order to get it through I had to author it at the final thing, and that s an example of both parties working together. I really don t know that I passed that bill. I stepped in when I needed to step in to get it through. I passed a bill this year making it a crime to beat up a pregnant woman, which only took me five years.

Oh, yes. Yes. I had tremendous help. Representative Mike Fair, he s a republican, but he was a tremendous help to me. Representative Charles Gray was a big help. Most of the other representatives from south Oklahoma City tried to help me. Frank Shurden representative he was a representative then he later became a senator and so did Mike Fair, he became a senator later. They both tried to help me. Of course I met my husband here and he didn t exactly take me under his wing, but we certainly formed an alliance, I would say. We ve been married a quarter of a century (Laughs) and raised two kids. I remember my first bill was a bill legalizing it made rape by instrumentation against the law, which had not been illegal before, and it made it illegal for a man to rape his wife. Well, that s kind of a 9 Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton bombshell to put out on back then, those were really controversial ideas, very much so. I can imagine. So I talked to the different legislators about it and they were all men that I was talking to about it and said, I don t know what to do and I m scared to go and I was, I was. You don t know what it s like standing up on that floor. There s a world of difference between watching a car wreck and being in one and standing up on that floor is a lot different when you re actually the one holding that mic. I mean, it is scary and they all come at you and ask you questions. They can really make you look like a fool, which is something most people fear a great deal. I told them, I said, I don t know what I m going to do. I don t We sat up here one night late trying to figure out how to help me pass that bill. And what we did, and I ve never told anyone this but I don t think he would mind now, I had another bill doing something or the other I don t remember what and they were both out on the floor. And Frank Shurden said, Well, what we ll do is I m going to amend your bill to put my castration bill in it, and then there s going to be this huge fight. He said, Then you run your bill making spousal rape against the law right after that, and they ll be so exhausted from the fight over the castration bill, they ll just pass it and never even notice what they ve done. There were about four or five of us who were involved in this genius plan, and that s exactly what we did and it worked. And it worked? And it worked. When I got the thing through the House, I couldn t find a Senate author to save myself. They would not touch it, and finally Frank Keating stepped up. I ll never forget that. He was a senator at that tim
, and I had been through everybody in both parties, and I went to Frank and he said I still remember this because this was my first bill and I was a scared kid and he said, Of course I ll help you. What you re doing is right and it needs to be done and, yes, I will help you. I have never ever forgotten that about Frank Keating and so anyway yeah, I had a lot of help. Has it gotten any easier to do bills on the floor? No, it s much harder now. Oh, you mean handling things Yes. on the mic and stuff? Yes, it s easier. I know what to do. It s always 10 Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton scary when you stand up. You never know what s going to happen on that floor, but no, I don t get petrified before I handle a bill on the floor anymore, if that s what you re asking. Have you had any other bills that just stick out the ones you re proudest of? Well, I was the original author of the Protective Order here in Oklahoma. It took me two years to pass that back in the day and the major reason why is because it took me that long to get the chips to pass it. That was a big coup because that was just unthinkable to pass that here. That, I guess, and my first I also got this capacity hotline for rape victims here in Oklahoma. I got the funding it wasn t a piece of legislation, but I got the funding to set up the first statewide it was five pilot programs around the state for adult daycare. Okay. And I was one of the people who worked on nursing home reform, and back then nursing homes really, really, really needed reforming. Then when I came back, I ve done a lot of things in my second go-around that I m really proud of, too. Can you tell us about those? Well, I remarked earlier that I was pro-choice in my first time in office. Well then I had a very powerful religious conversion, and when I came back I was pro-life which has been the source of a great deal of controversy surrounding me. As part of that process, I was the primary author of the House Bill 1686 in 2005. That was the bill that broke the log jam. There was a 30-year log jam on pro-life legislation, and getting that through changed that. Now a big part of that change was the republican takeover of the House. It changed the climate quite a bit, too but it took all of us. I think that s something that people don t realize. We desperately need both parties to be working together on things that matter and not trying to shoot each other down all the time. That s terrible for the people, terrible for the country. I passed that. Let s see I passed a bill saying that you couldn t put rape victims private information on the Internet, which I thought was very important. I passed another pro-life bill, and both of these bills required informed consent before abortion. They required parental consent for minors. The first bill said that if you murder a pregnant woman you can be charged with the death of the baby as well as the death of the woman. Then the second bill basically dealt with funding and some of those issues. I passed that.

 Du: That's wonderful. So at this period of time you're working on Viva Colores!, and you're also beginning to think of your fourth one, Women Who Light the Dark. Was it very busy for you to manage all of these different books at once? 86 Gianturco: [00:21:01] It's very hard to do two books at the same time for me because writing is an internal process, and promoting is an external process. I almost can't do them at the same time. I was traveling to speak about and promote Viva Colores! at the same time I was beginning to generate content for Women Who Light the Dark. It was very difficult. I was working twelve to fourteen days a day just simply to do it. These are not kind of throwaway projects that you do in addition to something else. They really are consuming and very demanding. So that was difficult. [00:21:51] I see Women Who Light the Dark as the first as a triptych. I think about Women Who Light the Dark, Grandmother Power, and Wonder Girls as differ
nt ways to tell the stories of girls' and women's activism at different ages in their lives. And, yes, I had begun to conceive Women Who Light the Dark at the same time I was trying to promote ¡Viva Colores!. Let me show you Women Who Light the Dark. [sounds of a book being picked up]. You can see where I was on the map on the inside front cover. I was in all of those countries. There were fifteen of them this time. Most of the stories in this book are about women who are heading NGOs and doing very interesting, important work--working on the most intractable problems that face women virtually everywhere. [00:23:00] The first story was actually about a group started by a high school English teacher [Betty Makoni] in Zimbabwe who started an organization called the Girls Empowerment Network. Betty had been listening to the stories that her high school students-87 her English students--were telling her and she discovered that the medicine women in their culture were telling HIV-positive men that they would be cured if they had sex with virgins. The men were having sex with--they were raping--these teenage girls, who were, of course, then HIV-positive. Betty Makoni decided that she would organize these girls and help them understand what was going on, how to avoid it, how they could help each other, how they could come to each other's aid, and so forth. [00:24:02] The first photograph is these girls at their board meeting. I went to the board meeting expecting to see teachers and social workers. No. Girls! [laughs] This [NGO actually inspired my idea of doing a book about groups of activist] girls. Du: Was it ever difficult for you to deal with these emotionally tough issues? Gianturco: This was the turn in my own work when I made a decision not to avoid these issues. Some of them were so disturbing that I had consciously chosen to exclude them because I wasn't sure I could handle them. I took a photographic course in the Czech Republic and promised myself--I was there for a month, taking one week-courses with very experienced professional photographers. [00:24:58] I promised myself that in the course of that month I would photograph everything I was afraid of photographing. It was a real stretch. I photographed people kissing, and I photographed people in church. [laughs] I just barged into all kinds of places where it was awkward to photograph--where I felt there were people doing things too private to be photographed--trying to get over my own inhibitions. [My ability to 88 document the girls in Zimbabwe] was the result of [my experience in the Czech Republic]. I knew I could photograph these girls who were working on this really horrific problemves really, really well. And so I would be shooting over here to the left, and David would see something way over here to the right that I had my back to. I might--or might not-have been able to refocus and capture his picture. But he has a very accurate and astute visual capacity that I really respect. I am glad to have that working with me..

Du: Tell me about the projects you're working on now. Gianturco: I'll tell you about Wonder Girls. Well, what can I tell you about Wonder Girls? As far as I can tell, there are no other books that document the work of groups of activist girls. There are books about individual activists like Malala. But I was seeing, as early as 2007, girls in Zimbabwe who began a girls movement in their country. They made child rape a national issue using an interesting tool. [00:47:08] Remember, [the Girls' Empowerment Network] was started by a high school English teacher. Those girls use poetry, which they write about their own experiences and recite in public. As soon as they do, [snaps fingers] their communities are mobilized to action against the men who rape girls. I've been interested for a long time in what groups of girls can do, even groups of very young girls. I was particularly interested in the age group from ten to eighteen. The UN says you're no longer a girl after eighteen. You're a woman. So Wonder Girls. I was thinking about this book for a while, both in relationship to Women Who Light the Dark and Grandmother Power. It was a natural next step to explore the topic of groups of activist girls, partly because I think these intractable problems will take a long time to solve. [00:48:16] I was interested in groups because once there is [an organizational] structure, the current participants can go on to the rest of their 98 lives--and younger girls can grow into that structure and continue the work. So I wanted to focus on groups from the beginning. [For Wonder Girls], I went to thirteen countries, one of which was the US, and interviewed fifteen groups of activist girls working on all kinds of initiatives from the environment to social justice to exploitation to child marriage and so forth

Rodriguez: That's amazing. I want to talk a little bit more about you being a woman. I know this isn't the point you want to put emphasis on, but you brought it up a little bit today. Did you ever feel alienated by being a woman? Shapiro: [01:07:05] No, and I think maybe it comes down to two things. I used the word "selfish" once before. I was so involved in what I had to do that I had no time to think about that other stuff. And there's a second, very important thing. Whatever my loving family did, they instilled in me a confidence that I rarely see in the young women I train now. 44 I have never been without confidence. I've never doubted what I could do. If you have that confidence, whatever is going on around you is their problem, not yours. I know that sounds odd, but it made a huge difference, having faith in myself. I didn't need someone else to tell me what I could do--I knew. Did I face discrimination because I was a woman? Of course I did. We all did. But to me it was their problem, not mine. I had a job to do, and it just never stopped me. [01:08:17] There were difficult experiences. Of course there were. I remember once giving a talk. I was quite young. It was just after I graduated. I gave a talk at a Gordon Research Conference. Gordon Conferences are meetings held up in New Hampshire and Vermont on specific areas of science. They go on for a week, and you meet in the morning and you meet at night. It's scientists, all the hotshot scientists in your area. So it was a big honor that I was giving a twenty-minute talk at this thing, and I remember it was at night. It was in the days of miniskirts. This is late 1960s, early 1970s. It was rare to have women around, and there I was. I got up on the stage to start my talk, and my mic didn't work. I said, "Should I take it off?" [01:09:12] And some guy--I'll never forget this--in the audience said, "Take it off. Take it all off." And there I am, standing there alone on this stage, at night, in a dark room, with the light on me, and all these men. I burst into tears. I had never done that before. The tears were just streaming down my face. Suddenly it got quiet in the room, and these guys had realized that they had crossed some terrible barrier. 45 I sniffed and wiped my tears away, and I said, "Are you done, and are you ready to hear some science?" I took a deep breath, and I gave my goddamn talk. And that was the worst experience I had ever experienced. I figured if I could get through that, hey.

Psychoanalysis is years of individual therapy. Social work deals with people who beat their wives, or have drinking problems, or child abuse problems. You don't do years of therapy looking back in childhood with them. You can't handle the problems in that way. It just doesn't work.

both walk to work, since we both worked at the University by then. But what I recall also, and it was really odd -- my daughter was very precocious for her age, and so she thought nothing of telling the teachers and her classmates that she Elaine Barney 3 was a feminist and that her mother was a feminist. So some of the kids, I remember, ganged up on her. They didn't hit her or do anything like that, but they said they were going to beat her up and rape her after school. When I marched in to the principal's office and also to have a meeting with my daughter's teacher, it was just "Oh, oh, that's, you know." It was treated very dismissively, like "Oh, kids will be kids." It was the same attitude I had with the same principal when I said I did not want them to use any [corporal] punishment on my children. Right away the principal, who was an ex-Marine, said, "Under state law, it's perfectly legitimate for us to do this." And I thought, "Oh, my God, why in the world did we ever live down here?" [laughs] That was an initial impression that clearly stayed with me for a while until I got to know other people and began volunteering at a 24-hour hotline place, and saw that there were other people who had other thoughts and views about corporal punishment and feminism, so I could relax a bit. JD: For my clarification: how old was your daughter when this happened? EB: She was in second or third grade. She was all full of it at that point. I would take her along with us on some marches and things. I think, too, she had -- I think she still has it, I found it upstairs a few weeks ago -- a lunchbox, and it had Elizabeth Cady Stanton on it. We named our first dog "Elizabeth Cady Stanton," so she was called "Cady." She had all these feminist things that she painted on her lunchbox. JD: At that young age? EB: I think actually that part of it may have happened more, maybe fourth grade. So that was kind of [an] interesting situation. Elaine Barney 4 JD: So you said that when you came down

EB: Well, it was a community-based agency, non-profit agency. It had been formed and was run by people from the Mental Health Center. From that they spun off into other kinds of programs. Certainly there were people there would had degrees in counseling. I might have realized that so many people would go through Help Line, it was called initially, because the training was so great, and they wanted to find out what it would be like for them to be a counselor or social worker. So, they were flooded with all these people who really were like-minded in terms of what I was wanting to do at some point. They had open minds, and didn't agree with Jesse Helms. This Help Line would do hot lines on the phone. You'd have to sign up for a shift after you got some training. There'd be some staff who had a degree in counseling, and they could be backup in case there was a serious situation that was developing, someone was suicidal or had been raped. For me, it was a very good way to be introduced to the community, because I found out about all these agencies, like the Rape Crisis Center, and also what we didn't have at that point, which was something for battered women.

EB: Yeah. When you say the Women's Health Collective, we weren't known as that at all. JD: How were you guys known? EB: I don't know! [laughs] JD: I think a lot of the time too people have questions and they're like "That's the person you go to, when you have that question," but they don't have any idea. You're the expert on certain questions people ask. EB: I think initially it was the three agencies trying to get funding for our agencies. And yet, at the same time, there was concern for each of them about well, are the county commissioners going to say "Oh, we'll just fund you all in one fell swoop and then you can fight among yourselves about it." Or at times we were trying not to get into these power trips of "Oh, this is the most important person, agency. I want my agency to do that." We spent a lot of time talking about that. We'd be sitting on the floor in this little place that had been rented by the Coalition for Battered Women, and trying to make sure that the agencies felt respected by the other agencies and that the funding would also go to all three, to each of them. I think we were left almost without a choice because the county commissioner said, "Well, here it is." They wanted to appoint this one person who would decide all of these financial decisions. That united the three of the agencies, saying "Well, actually, I think that we need to remain separate." The majority of the county Elaine Barney 17 commissioners were men, and sometimes they couldn't grasp the fact that a Rape Crisis Center would be very different from a Women's Health Counseling Service, which would be very different from the Coalition for Battered Women. It was like, "But you're all women and you're all talking about it, so why not just put it all together?" and it's like, &#8220;Doesn't work that way.&#8221; Because everyone each had a piece of it, we knew what we wanted in each of the agencies. How to ensure that the general public understood that was going to take some doing. That's where we spent a lot of time. And understanding that yeah, Women's Health Counseling Service doesn't have the same financial needs that perhaps the Rape Crisis Center, or the Coalition for Battered Women, would have. But it also had certain needs that weren't being met, but we needed the money for them. For example, this woman Faye I think was befriended by a pharmacist. No, it wasn't a pharmacist. Was befriended by someone who worked for a place where they could get pregnancy tests. He would give us a test kit so we could do that at cost. It was like $50 for this test. So we would serve 50 women, and we would get $50 so that when he came again, we could give him the next $50, and that was what we needed. And we were able to ask them if they could to donate $1, so we could do the pregnancy tests. And so that's how we were working with that. It depended on the kindness of the staff people, the person who in charge of the hotline, to help us do the Xeroxing, that we didn't have to pay for. As it got more and more popular, and we had training manuals, then we had to do some other kinds of fundraising for our agency. But I think each person had their own unique set of responsibilities and priorities and needs, because they were serving different populations. Elaine Barney 18 JD: This is coming out of Herstory, because Elizabeth Grew quotes from your statements that you said that the Women's Health Center was kind of the odd man out in public view, or not as celebrated in the public view because you were providing services and counseling pregnant women, or discussing abortion. How did that impact negotiations and your interaction with the public? EB: Well, let me just go back. There was no issue that I recall between the three, once we worked out, "Okay, the funding is not going to be equal because the needs aren't equal and blah blah blah." What we were able to all agree on was the need for those three agencies, because those were the primary needs as we saw them. The people coming in for help clarified that even more. It was through making sure, for example, that when we were trying to get money from the county, and the person who was the man in charge of the Health Department was very threatened, because basically what he said to one of the people working there was we would be applying for their money. And so the Health Department was going to lose all their funds to these people who were in favor of abortion. So I would have to talk to some of the Commissioners, and/or write a letter rebutting that, that so-and-so said this, but that's not what we're doing. We're not about to take money away, we're hoping that the county commissioners will find additional funds for this needed service, the way there are for the needed services of the Health Department. But it was just amazing when I first heard that -- he said what??!! But that's just how it is with the funding part of it. Also, we became more aware of the need to join -- there was some other group, and initially it seemed like they were predominately men, who were the director of the mental health agency, the county health agency, and I'm trying to think of some others. Elaine Barney 19 There were all these other agencies that were all - surprise, surprise! they were primarily male for all the directors. Ours was different, and I don't think they knew what we did or how we thought, other than we were feminists. And someone said, "You know, you're not going to conquer them, but you can join them," and I thought, "Ooh, yeah." So we could, because we were a county agency for all three of us, and I think all of us were represented there, because we each could talk about our specific agency and the reason we were coming there, or the need of battered women or women who had been sexually assaulted. And they got to see us as individuals. I think it made a real difference, because we applied for and were able to get some money from United Way. It took a while for them to kind of get it, to understand it. But once they saw us as individuals and could hear us talk about our programs, and we did get accepted by United Way, then that helped, too. It was just a process that none of us knew what we were getting into when we started.

HC: So the question though, and the thing I have been fortunate, actually, I&#8217;ve been blessed by it, because I&#8217;ve been able to work with a group of people that have been in abusive situations for generations and the thing I&#8217;ve learned is I haven&#8217;t been in an office in Knoxville or someplace, or had them here in my home; I&#8217;ve been in their homes and worked with mother, daughter, grandmother that have all been abused, been through an abusive situation, so it&#8217;s really focused my attention on that one area. I finally have come to the conclu--. Well I haven&#8217;t come to any conclusion really, yet, but--. [Laughs] My thinking is that the situation, the anxiety level is so severe, [and] when you mix trauma into it you&#8217;re in a dangerous situation where there&#8217;s no hope, and that&#8217;s the worst thing, no hope. You&#8217;ve eliminated any chance for somebody to have any--. Well self esteem&#8217;s important too, of course, but hope; that&#8217;s a sad state when you&#8217;re in a situation where there&#8217;s no hope. DC: And that&#8217;s what you see a lot. HC: Oh, yeah, you see a lot of it, and you want to try to get back at the children at an early age, and we focus on two to five, really younger, two to three, to try to give them some self esteem and try to prepare them for crisis as much as possible in a school environment, because that&#8217;s what their lives are. There&#8217;s going to be crisis. They go into homes that aren&#8217;t adequate. They&#8217;re exposed to things that most people aren&#8217;t exposed to at those ages because of the confinement of where they live. They can&#8217;t escape it, that&#8217;s the trouble. They can&#8217;t escape to a place of safety. They&#8217;re trapped in a four hundred square foot trailer with thin walls so they&#8217;re exposed to sexual acts, they&#8217;re exposed to pornography, they&#8217;re exposed to all kinds of junk that normal children can get away from, they can escape from. These children can&#8217;t and if you see an abusive situation you&#8217;ll find that they&#8217;re trapped even more so because the care givers won&#8217;t let them out of the environment, so they trap them in a trailer, say. They won&#8217;t go to daycares, they won&#8217;t go to preschool, they don&#8217;t go to Head Start and people never know they&#8217;re there, so by the time they get into the school system and they&#8217;ve been abused they don&#8217;t make it, and there&#8217;s a lot of them. And I&#8217;m not just talking about sexual abuse; I&#8217;m talking emotional and physical.

The police are so far away by the time they get there it&#8217;s over or the people are gone. It&#8217;s a huge problem. It&#8217;s a huge problem. HC: There&#8217;s one sheriff that covers I think--. I can&#8217;t remember what he told me. I might be wrong saying this but I thought he said three hundred square miles, so he covers from Stinging Creek up to the border of Claiborne County, Kentucky, which is a huge area. PC: Very mountainous. HC: Now that&#8217;s not the Jellico place. That&#8217;s the sheriff of Campbell County, so there&#8217;s--. Oh, yeah, another thing: Drugs have infiltrated the family I mean there&#8217;s an inordinate number of children born in utero with drugs, just all over the place. I&#8217;d say eighty percent of the people I work with are on drugs or affected by it. DC: Is it methamphetamine in that area? HC: Methamphetamines and opiates. DC: Okay. HC: OxyContin and things like that. DC: Oh, right, of course. PC: Also there&#8217;s a lot of marijuana grown up there too. HC: Yeah, there&#8217;s marijuana growing, but that doesn&#8217;t--. I don&#8217;t see any of that really. I mean you know people are smoking pot but I&#8217;ve never run into a big--. They had a big bust up there last year--this year. I think it was a hundred something thousand dollars worth of drugs that was supposed to be a Mexican cartel up there, growing drugs. Anyway, I never saw it. I never bumped into it although I bump into a lot of drugs.

See the problem, every case I&#8217;ve had with a girl where she&#8217;s been severely abused sexually the state has put her in custody, they&#8217;ve put her in a situation where there&#8217;s no mental health, what I call real mental health system. It&#8217;s short term, it&#8217;s not effective, so another area I really want to work on, and I&#8217;m trying to work on this now, is getting mental health up there with video conferencing, because we can&#8217;t get psychiatrists up there. There&#8217;s a friend of mine who works with Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and we&#8217;ve been up to the hospital to talk to them about putting a video conferencing center up there and using the psychiatrist down here to work the counseling, so that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re working on. We&#8217;re trying to get the state more aware of the abuse problem and do something about it so we are trying to do things, but the problem is so deep rooted and so severe that it&#8217;s--. We&#8217;re trying to do little things at a time, I guess, but the focus is on those children. It&#8217;s still on those children. DC: And you&#8217;ve got to get to them that young, is what I&#8217;m hearing. HC: Oh, I think so. You&#8217;ve got to get them--. The thing is if you get a child that&#8217;s been in an abusive situation, say seven years later they go into grade school, they don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on around them, really. Then they get into high school and that&#8217;s when they start dropping out and they become very sexual. The girls, at thirteen a lot of them are pregnant, and you find there&#8217;s an inordinate number of gi
ls--seven, eight, nine, ten--that are very sexual. A lot of ministers and I talk about it. We sit there and say, we&#8217;ve got to be very careful about being around these girls, and it doesn&#8217;t matter what age you are. They&#8217;re repeating what they see in the homes. So you&#8217;ve got to try to get them--. We feel we&#8217;ve got to get them as early as possible. I wish we could go on to five and six and teach them as much as--I mean older--what they should do and shouldn&#8217;t do. We always find, I guess, that when they get into high school, they get out of that grammar school in eighth grade and they start going to high school, that&#8217;s when they start--. Now the girls that are severely abused, I would say they probably never get--. They might get into high school but I doubt if they&#8217;re capable of getting through it because they have personality disorders and all kinds of situations. They&#8217;re severely damaged, and there&#8217;s a lot of them. There&#8217;s an inordinate number.

 And so there was that going on, there was that sense of the evilness of things, even while we were all running through the woods naked [laughs]. But I think that it felt like a really free time, and people were really not taking advantage of that freedom with each other. That was my experience. Totally a generalization. I&#8217;m sure there are horror stories about that time from other people. But for me, it was a time of being totally able to go to a limit that I never dreamed existed, and to understand myself in relation to some things that I never thought about before. And I always have been a little philosophical. I managed to always have been one of those--. And even quasi-religious at some point, and so, the whole spiritual and soul-searching aspects and behavioral aspects of doing drugs and the whole culture thing was fascinating to me, and wonderful. And music was such a big part of it for me. So yeah, it was a very, it seems now, it seemed like a long time at the time, but it was a really brief period of time that things were really great

GE: Yeah. I started one in California, in San Francisco. There was one group of us, a small group there. A couple of women were flight attendants. Actually, almost all the women I knew either were, or had been, flight attendants. And in fact, I have two friends now who I&#8217;ve known since we were flight attendants together, who I&#8217;m still friends with. They both live on the west coast, they both live in the Seattle area. It&#8217;s funny. And one of them who had been my roommate, her daughters are my godchildren. So we still have that connection. So all the women either were, or had been, flight attendants, who were in this consciousness-raising group. And some of that was also from the union, because some of the women in the union, some of the women I flew with who were in the union, and who were active in the union were more political. And truthfully, it was San Francisco, and so probably as a group we were more feisty and political than some of the other places. So anyway, yeah, we had a consciousness-raising group there. And then when I came back here, I started one here. I think those were really big. I think those were really--. It&#8217;s hard. This probably sounds inflated and pompous to say that they we were really revolutionary, but in a way they really were. Because it was the only time, for all of us, it was the only time we ever really got to talk about those, or had a chance to even explore with each other, &#8220;Gee, have you ever been to the doctor and they did this to you?&#8221; Or talking about people who had been sexually abused, or raped--. I mean, that was never, ever talked about. So it truly was a liberating experience for people to be able to talk about that with each other, and find out that we had so many things in common, as far as those experiences as women. And the sad part of it was that often it didn&#8217;t go anywhere. You just shared all that, and then you felt personally empowered, but it didn&#8217;t necessarily lead to any action, which is always the case with us, with &#8220;lefties,&#8221; right? We talk a lot, but we don&#8217;t always take action. But it was incredible. It was an incredible part of the foundation of women&#8217;s awakening, if you will. And I think that some of the women&#8217;s work that I did in the [19]80s and &#8217;90s was that way, too. It was kind of, women opening up to each other and being able to say things they couldn&#8217;t say anywhere else. It was pretty important stuff.

Sometimes you just sit around, and so you talk to people, and of course they always wanted to talk to you. Really understanding women&#8217;s lives, and what women in a small town or rural area, what they were dealing with. Women who worked at the mills, women who had relatives who were invalids who they took care of all the time, women with husbands who abused them, I mean, it was--. Even though I thought I knew a lot about women&#8217;s experience, it was a whole other piece of my political education. And then, also understanding the role of how those things work in small towns, like a beauty shop, how that works as far as what it does for the community in terms of bringing people together, and how it&#8217;s a place where, it&#8217;s like a consciousness-raising group. And how much support, and how much that was where women were able to be free. I don&#8217;t know, I could have written a whole book about that experience. It was a wonderful experience. It was so much a part then of what I came to more deeply understand about what was going on as far as women&#8217;s lives and working people in rural areas. It was really great. So that was a big thing for me.

 But anyway, that students themselves aren&#8217;t trapped in this same, quite such a limiting way of having to look and be. Female students speak up, and they don&#8217;t even realize themselves, I don&#8217;t think, that they have a kind of consciousness that was literally not there in the &#8217;60s. There was no such--. I mean I didn&#8217;t have it. I didn&#8217;t think women are oppressed, women are a constituency with a certain set of needs and wrongs that need to be righted and all of that. They now think that. They&#8217;re not feminists, although a lot of them are not as afraid of saying that they&#8217;re feminists as the media would have you believe, but they&#8217;re not activists, I guess is what I would say, but they certainly have a feminist consciousness. I mean if some guy tells them girls can&#8217;t do this or that and the other thing they don&#8217;t believe that at all. They&#8217;re the first to tell them that. They know that there&#8217;s something called sexual harassment and that it&#8217;s wrong and that it shouldn&#8217;t happen to them, and they want to have careers, and they think that nobody should discriminate against them if they become pregnant.

I mean out on the far edges of should twelve-year-olds be able to get it without a prescription, you could have some argument, but in the main they definitely support birth control, family planning, abortion, whatever.

SK: That&#8217;s been really tough. There were a couple things that we had to work on in a variety of ways. One of them was language, okay, so that one&#8212;. Let&#8217;s see. We did that through the Commission for Women, so the Commission for Women in that case, we proposed some language guidelines and we got Chancellor Reese to agree to append them to the faculty handbook, because we wanted to have some place that we could point to and say you need to use gender neutral language. I&#8217;m coming to sexual harassment, but actually what you might think would be harder, we got that first that way. On the sexual harassment thing, I was on a committee of the AEP [Affirmative Employment Program] and we looked at policies at various schools and drafted one, and that&#8217;s probably dated in the 1980s, and again that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got and that&#8217;s become an issue. Okay, so at least we got something done, and it was that we were not successful, let&#8217;s say, in getting the administration to put one in but we could come in the back way and say we&#8217;re proposing this, so it&#8217;s coming from the side, if you will. Then you&#8217;d encounter all these people saying things like, &#8220;But that&#8217;s how I met my wife. That&#8217;s how I met my husband. You&#8217;re denying us the opportunity.&#8221; [Laughs] Well just keep your pants zipped up and wait a little while. It&#8217;ll work. JF: [Laughs] SK: But you can&#8217;t say those things. So Cheryl Travis and I have been talking about updating that policy because she&#8217;s been working on some stuff in the psychology department and I&#8217;ve been trying to get the AEP to retake it up as an issue, to update it and make it more powerful, because what it is, is it&#8217;s very weak. It&#8217;s a weak statement as it's written because that&#8217;s what we could get accepted, but ultimately you have to be strategically political. It&#8217;s better to have something that you can build on than have nothing. It doesn&#8217;t have enough clout in it, if you will. So, yeah, that&#8217;s one of our current projects, is to try and do that, and Cheryl [Travis] and I have published together on sexual harassment. It&#8217;s been a topic of interest. Certainly in the field of psychology it&#8217;s rampant. [Laughs] I mean in that professors exploiting graduate women has been talked about for decades and continues. JF: What was the resistance to a stronger sexual harassment policy? SK: Well it always starts from the kind of thing of sort of denying people the right to meet other people, as I said: That&#8217;s how I met my husband; that&#8217;s how I met my wife. That I think underneath it all is the idea of, you know, sort of like with rape, that there&#8217;d be false accusation, that there&#8217;d be misunderstandings. But overall institutions are not keen on dealing with sexual harassment, so I spent eight or nine years as the ombudsperson for students on campus and obviously encountered students who had various problems, and I discovered that the institution basically wants them to go away, okay. So they don&#8217;t want there to be action taken against somebody for sexual harassment; they want them to leave, or the student to leave, or whatever, okay, because that&#8217;s the whole problem with a lot of the policies that you have to sort of protect people, is that the institution&#8217;s really at heart trying to protect itself and so they&#8217;re not going to be supportive of things that would ever sort of make it public or lead to lawsuits or whatever. So, yeah, that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s not stronger policies. JF

LM: I think one of the things that&#8217;s interested me is how men began to change attitudes as their daughters graduated from college and started looking for jobs. I saw a sea change in attitude because their girls were facing what a lot of the rest of us had faced. I think it became clear that the path was not get a college degree, get married, and have babies. So I think there became a change that started in the late [19]70s and continued. I&#8217;m proud of what we did. I am very disgusted, angry, frustrated over what I see is part of a religious-seeming religious, I guess, I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s all coming from-of trying to put the genie back in the bottle, trying to put women back into--. And they&#8217;re using Roe v. Wade and birth control and all. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a generational situation where people are fearful, but I feel like some of the things that we accomplished, we&#8217;re losing. I mean, to pass a bill that requires the IRS to look into the tax situation of women who have been raped, there&#8217;s something sick going on. When Congress is spending all this time and our state legislature all this time on all of these non-issues, it&#8217;s like the war on women. That&#8217;s what some people are calling it, and I think that&#8217;s very accurate. I think the war on teachers is almost a war on women. You espouse education as important and, yet, you&#8217;re trying to take rights away from teachers. I don&#8217;t get it. So I&#8217;m very angry about that because I think we&#8217;re trying to step back to a time--. And people keep talking about, oh, how it was in the [19]50s. Well, bullshit. (laughs) The &#8217;50s were not the be [all] and [end] all. I think women were stuck in family situations. They didn&#8217;t have the independence to get out of abusive situations. There was no women&#8217;s crisis center, women&#8217;s sexual assault center. There was no support network in that era.

Now that was kind of a gender based issue. We had a little sexual harassment going on down there with our county commissioner and a lot of people really felt that a woman would be the answer. So when I found about twenty women asked me to run county employees I did choose to run and I did win. I was very surprised again. That was a hot and heavy race too.

Speaker 2: I would go to Catholic church. Speaker 1: To Mass (unclear). Speaker 2: And I think I stopped going to Catholic church when I was like sixteen and then I decided when I was getting to marry my first husband, Cecil [Cecil Bridgewater], that I needed to go back to church and I needed to confess and I needed to marry. I married into the Catholic church. Speaker 1: And that's amazing, and so that does speak to the hold that church had on-- Speaker 2: Uh-huh, but I had, I had an incident when I did my confession with the priest. I don't remember what church I went to, if it was St. Matthew's [St. Matthew Catholic Church, Flint, Michigan] or if it was St. Michael's [St. Michael Catholic Church, Flint, Michigan]--oh, it was a church, it was a Catholic church in East Lansing [Michigan], because I was at Michigan State [Michigan State University] at the time, and he wanted me to give him details. I said, "You know I have kissed and I've, I've been fondled up--," you know, because we've been told that we have to confess everything and you know of course, I had not had full blown sex, but you know I'd done everything almost, but you know and so when I was, I was saying that he said, "Well, like wow, how many times did you kiss?" I was like, "I don't know, father." "Did he touch you?" "Oh, yes father." "Did he touch your breasts?" "Oh, yes father." You know, "Well how many times?" And I started like hearing him like breath heavy and so then he asked me to, to wait for him after he finished the, you know, the confessions and then he wanted to talk to me, and I remember sitting outside, it was like in the spring. I remember sitting outside of this church on a bench and this priest coming out and I noticed he was like really sweaty and he took my hand and he was like, "My child," you know. I don't know what he said but his hands were all clammy and I was like, I mean I'm like, dude, but I was like, "Sorry, father." He says, you know, "I need to have some one on one time with you to help you to cleanse yourself." And I was like, I've been down that road. I was molested from like the age of twelve, I was molested like, four times. I was raped twice. So, I'd already--so I knew that one. I knew that story (laughter). So, I was like, "Oh, no, I'm not going." Speaker 1: This by, by a Catholic priest? Speaker 2: It was a Catholic priest. Wanted to give me some one on one sessions. So, thank--well, you know thank goodness, I'd had other incidents in that regard that I knew, but when he grabbed my hand with my hand it was oh so clammy, he was breathing hard. I don't know if I'd given him an erection or not, but I knew it was wrong. Story_ID: 659977 Speaker 1: You wanna tell that story? Speaker 2: Sure, there was a priest at St. Matthew's [St. Matthew Catholic Church, Flint, Michigan], his name was Father O'Grady [ph.]. He was--not only, he was, he was a horrible man. He was an alcoholic; at that time the church which was almost like a small cathedral, they had installed a mic [microphone] system because you couldn't hear the Mass if you were in the back of the church, and when he would receive the Blood of Christ (laughter), the altar boy would, would tip you know the little cup. I think they used to drink Mogen David wine, I don't know, and he'd, you know, pour the, the wine into the chalice and the priest would always--Father O'Grady would always hit the pitcher so that the altar boy would pour more wine in, and then he would drink it and I, I don't know why nobody ever told him that when you drink and if you, if you sigh, we're gonna hear it all over the church. He would drink that wine down and he'd go (makes sound). (Laughter) Oh lord and when he would get the, you know receive the, you know, Blood of Christ before he would give out the, the first communion, same thing, (makes sound). But I saw him on at least three occasions feeling up the novice nuns, going up under--they had these long white bibs that they wore that was part of their habit, going up under there and feeling their breasts and just having them pinned up against the wall in between the, the convent and the church rectory and there was this narrow little wall-way, hallway or walkway rather, and I saw him do this like three times and then I was told by someone that there were a lot of, of abortions, I mean a lot of aborted bodies that were buried on the grounds of the convent. Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw, (unclear) say that about (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then there, you know we would have the strange disappearances of some young nun, she'd be in school one day and then I mean and then she wouldn't be at, at the school anymore, and you wouldn't see her at the convent anymore and I suspected those were the ones that were getting pregnant. Speaker 1: Did you see anything comparable in the public school [Southwestern High School; Southwestern Classical Academy, Flint, Michigan], with teachers and students or as teachers and other teachers (unclear)? Speaker 2: I had a--I had my science teacher really, really like me and he would always allow me to come and work on my, my science projects and he would get close to me but I--like I said, I'd had all these incidents happen to me so I knew how to move away. I mean I was molested by my [paternal] step-grandfather when I was eleven in front of my sister [Rhonda Garrett Whiters]. Can you believe that? But I did have--no, but at the public school, that was the only incident that I knew about and I don't--no one ever mentioned having any issues, but I'm talking about the black children. So, I don't know what happened with the white kids. Speaker 1: So, you had, you had quite a few things that happened to you that weren't really supposed to happen to a girl your age? Speaker 2: Yep. Speaker 1: Before you-- Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: So. Speaker 2: Often. Speaker 1: Hm. Speaker 2: You know I was quite well endowed by the time I was twelve. I wore, up until I was fifty, you will not see me in anything that fit because of all those problems and then when I turned fifty I felt like I could control, I knew I could control my situations and I wanted to, everybody was getting breast augmentations and here I had these natural things and so I said, "Oh, I'm--shoot everybody else is doing it," and that was when I first started wearing clothes that fit. I would never wear a dress like this before in my forties (makes sound), everything was loose, everything was loose and that, it's because of that. Story_ID: 659978 Speaker 1: Now, did you have opportunities 
o actually sing when you at, at South- was it South? Speaker 2: Southwestern [Southwestern High School; Southwestern Classical Academy, Flint, Michigan]? Speaker 1: Southwestern (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh yeah. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: I put a group together, we called ourselves The Iridescents. I wrote with a girlfriend named Valerie Washington [ph.], we wrote the songs together and we did talent contests. We modeled ourselves after The Marvelettes, who were a part of Motown [Motown Records] when it first happened. They, two of the members of The Marvelettes grew up on the, on one street over from the street that I, I grew up on from my early teens and, oh yeah. When we got to sixteen, my girlfriends didn't wanna rehearse, they all were, they were both into boys you know and I you know, I hadn't--I didn't have sex until I was almost eighteen. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: They were, they were you know they had boyfriends. Speaker 1: And consensual sex you're talking about? Speaker 2: Consensual sex. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: Yeah, consensual, thank you. Story_ID: 659979 Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was your situation, was it shared by a lot of young ladies your, your age, did they have the same, a similar experience or was it (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't speak about it. Speaker 1: Okay, so it'd be hard to tell? Speaker 2: That, that was totally unspoken stuff. I have no idea if they went through what I went through. Speaker 1: I know publicly for the--well, once I guess 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' I'll tell you was the first time I heard a lot of stories about you know the molestation of young girls in the home. Speaker 2: Um-hm and incest too. Speaker 1: You know by relatives and that that sort (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it's always by somebody you know. Speaker 1: I never really heard of, about it. I didn't--it wasn't part of what I ever heard anybody talking about or thought was going on, but after so many people started talking about it, you know I said, "Well, I think it's probably more pervasive that I thought it was." Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure. I mean I don't know about my girlfriends themselves, but I have a girlfriend, one of my girlfriends from Flint [Michigan] whose daughter was molested for years by my girlfriend's husband, for years and she's now in her early forties and she's just getting over it and she's now you know trying to work with you know other young women that have gone through that. And she just-- Speaker 1: Hm, it's (unclear) (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, and it, like two years ago, I said to my, my girlfriend, "You've got to change your name my dear, and go back to your maiden name. You can't keep the name of the man who raped your child constantly. Hello?" And she went, "Aw Dee Dee [HistoryMaker Dee Dee Bridgewater] I never thought about it." I was like, "Hello, no." So, so I, you know I, I none of my girlfriends ever talked about that stuff happening to them, but it sure happened to me, you know. As a result of all of that happening to me, my choices in men were not good. Speaker 1: How so, I mean how did it affect (unclear)? Speaker 2: Because, well, I remember that when I had boyfriends when I was a teenager, I always had like at least two or three boyfriends, and I would juggle 'em and it was a game for me. I was a big tease, I would not, I would not go all the way, never, never, never, but I sure would flirt with them and let 'em think, you know, because they were either like the most popular or you know the cutest or you know the best singer or the you know, this you know, had the baddest in, in the good sense, you know.

 Speaker 1: Okay. Did your mother have some stories about growing up? Speaker 2: She talks about--my mother is a very interesting story, and I write about it in detail in my book, "Brothers (and Me): A Memoir of Loving and Giving" and she was the child of a rape, a male family member. My grandmother was a teenager and went berry-picking with this trusted relative and that happened and my mom was the product of that and she was--my grandmother was a good church-going girl and my grandmother was appalled and that's why my mother was born in New Jersey, because people couldn't know that this had happened. And so when my grandmother, I guess, started to show, she was spirited away and gave birth in New Jersey and it wasn't until seven years later that my mom moved in with her mother and became a part of her family, because she had been--she was raised in a boarding house in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] with a woman who wasn't very warm and wasn't very loving, but who took care of her. There were lots of tortured stories like these back when--when pregnancy--unwed pregnancy had to be hidden.

 Speaker 1: So police inquiry into this ended up exonerating the officers, right? Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Speaker 1: But then later-- Speaker 2: They were both kicked off the force for things unrelated to this. The next day after Darrell was killed, one of the cops beat up an Hispanic suspect and explained it by saying he was upset because he had never killed anybody, and so one was kicked off the force for burglary and the other for child molestation. Speaker 1: So these two cops weren't the best balanced cops-- Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know that people would say they were Gary's [Indiana] finest. I know very little about them.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--I kept writing opinion pieces, because I couldn't help myself. I always would see something happen. And I remember writing about the Clarence Thomas confirmation. I always want to call it trial, because it felt like a trial. And just the controversy about it and it had all these senators acting astonished, shocked, shocked that--that men came onto women, you know, during work, and it was just--it was so--nowadays, you know, we have a scandal a week. Back then it was more, you know, the senate, there weren't any women. And it was, you know, this bastion of basic white maleness. And we know what, you know, that much maleness means anywhere. You know there's going to be some of that stuff just because of human nature and these senators acting so agog at the idea that, you know, of sexual harassment. And it just felt like the height of hypocrisy. And I just remember watching it. It was like watching a soap opera. And so I wrote about that, you know, I wrote about black men in basketball, because I'd written about my dad. And I just wrote all these opinion pieces, and I just--but I was still amazed when Milton Coleman asked me if I wanted to be a metro columnist, cause, I mean, it was a dream come true had I dared to dream it. I didn't--the idea of writing opinion every day, you know, or twice a week was terrifying, because it meant putting myself out there and exposing myself. And I knew that I wasn't going to write the typical metro column with distance, because I really didn't know how to write like that, not opinion, it has to be personal, it has to be intimate. And there was nobody writing that column that I was reading. And I remember thinking, okay, I'll just tell him, you know, I want to write a weird column that goes to all these different places that nobody goes. He says you can write about whatever you want. I was like, dag(ph). He wasn't going to give me that out. And I was dating my husband at that point, who was also a journalist, and I remember telling him, he was at the Dallas Morning News, and telling him, you know what happened, Milton Coleman wants me to write a column. And he said that you were born to write a column, what are you talking about. And so I had to take it, because I knew the only thing--the only reason not to take it was just terror. So I took it. Story_ID: 39861 Speaker 1: Okay. So you said you wrote about Clarence Thomas. That's one of the columns, right? Speaker 2: I'm sure I wrote about him. And what I wrote about him before was an essay. I mean during his tenure, I'm sure I must have written about him. Speaker 1: Did you write about Mike Tyson. Well, that happened about the same Time? Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I wrote about Tyson, I wrote about O.J. [O.J. Simpson] (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: Mike Tyson was accused of raping a young lady in Indianapolis [Indiana], I guess, at the Expo [Indiana Black Expo]? Speaker 2: --Yeah, the girl was, you know, an eighteen year old Sunday school teacher, a virgin. And I remember how there were all these black women who came out in support of Tyson. And I--it's a phenomena that I came to understand. You know Darrell's death in some ways made that understandable for me because of--there's this innate and reflexive need to protect black men because of our history, because ours are the men that get dragged into the night. I mean, we have that history from slavery and Jim Crow, and from, you know, my brother [Darrell Britt]. And so the idea that we have to protect black men and we have to support them no matter what, even in a situation like that where, you know, Mike Tyson had a history of violent behavior. You know with--because at that point, he'd been with Robin Givens and that didn't go well, and that people supported him, women supported him was wild. It just shows you, I think, how deep this protective impulse goes, how deep that history goes.

you know, Clarence Thomas had actively distanced himself from the black community by--and during that, during his confirmation hearings, his sponsor, chief sponsor was white. His white--wife [Virginia Thomas] was, his wife was white. All the people who were rallying around him were white and yet many black people came forward to support him on the notion that he's going to, you know, his blackness will kick in, that it will be revealed that he has the same sort of cultural heritage that's so powerful for us, it has to be powerful for him and so we want him in there. And also the idea that he was, that people were trying to push him back. That, that raises something visceral in black people. The idea of rejection like that, because we feel so rejected so often, even on a daily basis, and historically rejected that when we see a black person being rejected, it, it, there's a visceral sense of protection.

 Speaker 1: Did, did you write about the Monica Lewinsky case? Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure I did, oh yeah. Speaker 1: What, what are your, what are your reflections about what happened to Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton]? That I, that dominated the news for months and months. Speaker 2: You know, I tend to look at these things as more human, it's a human mess, you know, and I'm always interested when people act astonished when any human being gets caught up in a human mess. You know, so, like when, again, with the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings and the [U.S.] Senate, which at that point was all male. You know, you have a hundred men professing complete and utter astonishment that someone, that, that, that there's harassment going on. It's like, what? What, there are men who say, you know, untoward things to women and, you're just watching that going like, wow, you know, what utter BS. And so, you know, Clinton, again, you know, he's a guy, a guy who's entitled, a guy who's used to, you know, who clearly had some issues with, with women and him getting caught up in something that we all knew that he was, it wasn't like, I mean, on the campaign trail, there were stories and scandals and so there was, it wasn't that big a surprise. I just remember being, again there're--all these stories, there's so many layers. There's the, the young girl who, who refuses to understand how she's viewed, who actually thinks she matters to this, to this guy, to this power- to the world's most powerful man. She actually thinks she matters and her saving address with, you know, and the wife [Hillary Rodham Clinton]. Oh my gosh, always the wife, and her steely determination to stick by him and just the palpable tension between them and what that had to do to her self image. Knowing that you're watching something that's going to be with her for the rest of her life. So, just so many layers of stuff. You know, the guy who has, what's considered a typical, certain kind of guy problem and how he, and his, the way he's trying to frame it in ways so it looks like something else. "I did not have sex with that woman, or intercourse, with that woman." So everyone's going, "Oh so, hm, what does that mean?" And you know, just so many interesting layers. So, there was a lot to write about there too. Story_ID: 674042

Speaker 2: That is a silly question, although I don't, how, what can, how can I know. I didn't think, I didn't see him getting elected so who knows. It's quite possible, anything can happen. My family, I have nothing but boys, nothing but sons [Justin Britt-Gibson, Darrell Britt-Gibson and Skye Merida], and they're obsessed with sports and the one thing I've learned from sports is anything can happen. You know, you think, you know, okay, so now we're, we're at the start of the, of March Madness, and there's a million dollar, a billion dollar, have you heard about this? A billion dollar thing where if you can guess all the different races, all the different contests correctly, you'll-- Warren Buffett and Quicken Loans [Quicken Loans, Inc., Detroit, Michigan] will give you a billion dollars and that's based on--but, hey, you know, anything can happen. I watch, you know, I watch 'The Prognosticators,' you know, I watch, 'Mike and Mike,' I watch because I have a eighteen year old son who's listening to all this stuff and I hear people know exactly what's going to happen and they never know, they're always wrong, they're worse than weather people, you know. So, maybe with a white wife he could have won, what do I know? I doubt it, but I didn't think he could be elected. Speaker 1: Okay, you think he would have had the same support from the black community that he ended up having had that been the case? Speaker 2: Voting wise, probably, talk wise, maybe not as much, I don't know. I think, we're pretty, you know, black people are pretty loyal. You know, we take anybody back, you know. You know Michael Jordan--Michael Jackson had little boys in his bed, apparently, you know. Talked about Clarence Thomas. You know, [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, you know, "Bitch set me up." You know, it doesn't--Mike Tyson, great example. You know, the guy rapes an eighteen year old virgin, Sunday School teacher and all these black women are, you know, "Free Mike," you know, we, we are a very, I think we've been through as a people so much that we, it takes a lot to permanently separate us and I don't, in fact, I don't know that I've seen that yet. I don't know what you'd have to do for the black (laughter) community not to take you back.

Story_ID: 97649 Speaker 1: Now, have you ever sought out help, I mean counseling about that? Speaker 2: Oh, hell, yeah (laughter). I've been in counseling most of my adult life (laughter). Speaker 1: I would guess. I just thought I'd ask you, you know. Speaker 2: It started when I was in Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. In addition to everything else I was raped in, while I was at Harvard, twice (laughter). I'd been so sheltered and so naive, so sheltered and so naive when I was Atlantic City [New Jersey]. Aunt Peggy [Bush] just, like the word "sex" was not uttered. I had no idea how to deal with or even recognize signals from men and therefore, could not, also not recognize when I need to get the hell out of there. So I got, put myself in situations twice where I shouldn't have been and paid the consequences twice. So and in addition to everything else that I'm telling you that dealing with, I was--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: So this is--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: --also dealing with that.

And so I, it was, you know, there was a lot of stuff that I had to deal with while I was Harvard [University]. Speaker 1: Yeah, well, what got you through it? Speaker 2: I don't know. I just have some innate--my mother [Norma Greve Storch] always liked to say that she had that sort of hearty pioneer stock, you know, that Mormon (laughter), those Mormon pioneers that went West (laughter), you know. I think it was combination of that and the foundation of love that Peggy and Paul and the Gregorys gave me, and actually, even my mother in her own way. I had fundamentally a strong center, and I wasn't--you know, very often people hear my story, and I get this look of pity and it's like, oh, you poor thing. Your mother didn't raise you (unclear). If my mother had raised me, I would be a neurotic mess, you know. She was so neurotic around race. She neurotic around skin color. She was neurotic around my hair.

Speaker 2: "Confessions of Rosa Lee". "Confessions of Rosa Lee" was done 1995. "Secret Daughter" came out in '96 [1996], yes. Was it '96 [1996], "Secret Daughter"? No, '95 [1995]. I had started "Secret Daughter", the film that became "Secret Daughter", and I'd done an interview with my mom [Norma Greve Storch]--at first, I thought I was going to try to shoot it. And I was shooting myself, and I--this is one of the reasons why you need a crew (laughter). I did an interview with my mother and forgot to turn the mic on. I had done mic check. I did everything (laughter), the mic worked, I hooked her up (laughter), and I was really, really nervous about doing this interview. I never turned the microphone back on. So I did a three-hour interview with her that was silent. I was rolling tape, and I had the, I hadn't turned the battery on, on the mic, so I had three hours of tape. I just didn't have any sound to go with the tape. So this has created a scene in the film that people have written thesises [sic] about, which I find hilarious. There's like women's studies things who've talked about--women's studies, PhDs, who've done entire papers about me, about me appropriating the voice of my mother and, you know, all this stuff. And it's very simple. I forgot to turn on the mic. And I needed to do something, and there was this thing that she talked about--'cause my dad, Jimmy [James Cross], was an abusive drunk. And there was one story that I grew up with, from the time that I was, ever since I could remember. It was
like "the story", you know, about my dad, which was that he used to beat her all the time, and there was this one very famous story that I almost knew it by heart. So she's telling the story, and I'm parroting--I'm speaking over her, using her words, while she's talking and there's times when our mouths are exactly in the same place at the same time. So anyway, people, women's studies groups always want me to talk about this (laughter), and I just say, I forgot to turn on the mic. It's really not that deep (laughter). But I guess if you're looking at it, you can find, critics can find something deep in it. It wasn't deep at the time. Most of the time, the things that we do in the edit room are the result of invention, borne out of necessity, not because you sit around thinking about, how can I be more creative today? So anyway, mom, wouldn't agree to sit down a second time for an interview. She thought, she said "it was the gods protecting me when you forgot to turn your mic on." And that was like in December. Story_ID: 99309 Speaker 1: Well, I was under contract to "Frontline". I had to do a second--(laughter)--I had to do a story, at least, a story a year. And they preferred two stories and I had nothing to show for myself. So I spent the entire Christmas party looking for a story. And the other story that had sort of been on the radar was something about welfare. Bill Clinton at that time was going to remake welfare as we know it. And I found a story that had been done by a reporter for the Washington Post, named Leon Dash [HM], and the story was a five-part series, I think, called Confessions of--"The Story of Rosa Lee Cunningham" was how it ran in the Washington Post. And Rosa Lee--Leon had gotten interested in the plight of the underclass and who was the underclass. And there was a lot of conflation about folks on welfare being the underclass. And there's actually a very--sociologists use a very strict definition to define members of the underclass. It's people who are third generation welfare recipients or in extreme poverty, are illiterate, have had lives that take them in and out of prison, are drug or substance addicted and have multiple children--on the mother's side--multiple children by different fathers. So Leon was interested in exploring this sort of, that subculture, I guess, I would call it. And he spent several weeks inside D.C. jails speaking to something like twenty-two or twenty-five people. And he discovered Rosalie. And, yeah, he told Rosa Lee that he wanted--what he was doing. And Leon is incredibly, just a straight shooter as a reporter. I learned so much from him, just sort of watching him work. He told her he was--what he was doing, explained why, told her that everything she said or did was going to be on the record, and he was not gonna pay her (laughter). And was she willing to do this, and she agreed. So he spent four years following her. And then I read the story--it ran right before Christmas, I think, in the Washington Post. And I was reading the story during the "Frontline" Christmas party--and "Frontline" never saw me at that Christmas party. I just never came out of my office. I came out at the end of the party, and I walked up to [David] Fanning, and I said, "I've just read the most incredible story ever. You've gotta read--(laughter)--you've gotta see this", you know. So I decided I was gonna try to do--I called Leon, and I said, do you think that Rosa Lee would be willing to take part in a documentary. So she did. She was, and I did. And Rosa Lee actually--if I had not done the story of Rosa Lee, I could not have done "Secret Daughter" 'cause I learned so much about--well, part of it was the craft of reporting from Leon, but the other part of it was Rosa Lee as a human being, having done--even though she was a despicable person. I mean she had prostituted her own daughter. She was a drug addict who had three of her own children who were also heroin addict. She was literally--she also was living with HIV. I think she was like the third, third person (laughter) I'd done a story with who was literally--she had AIDS. She was heroin addicted. She was going for her methadone every day. And she was the kindest, most giving grandmother that I had ever seen. I remember she had a--she wanted me to do a story at that point, she kept pushing me to do a story about how the teenage girls, because of all these blended families, women hooking up with different men, that every often, they would bring male children with them into the households, and then there was a sexual abuse of young girls going on, if there were female children in these households because they weren't supervised properly. And she kept pushing me to do this story, pushing me to do the story, and I was like, Rosa Lee, I can't do the story. And then she introduced me to her, to a granddaughter of hers, to whom this had happened, and this granddaughter had a baby. And at one point, I remember she said to me, "June, take that child, I wish you would take that baby and run away 'cause that boy's not gonna have a chance", you know. She said this in front of the child's mother, couldn't believe that she did that. But anyway, so Rosa Lee, even though she was, she was illiterate, but she had an incredible emotional intelligence. And I could never quite figure out whether she was performing for me or performing for the camera. And then one day we were in the doctor's office, and I had left the camera in the car. And she got up and she started testifying right in the middle of the doctor's office. She just got the spirit, you know, and then she was talking about how God had kept her alive today, and, you know, I didn't have the camera (laughter). You know, it was like my--I was getting ready to go run out and get the camera, 'cause I needed to have this scene. But it was poorly lit. There was no way I was gonna get it. I would have missed it. So at that point, I sort of decided she was both. And in deciding that she was both able to be this sort of horrible mom, but a most generous mom, and a person who performed for the cameras and wanted attention and yet, incredibly genuine about her own faith, it gave me space to allow a certain ambiguity that I needed in order to approach my own family story, I think. Story_ID: 99310 Speaker 1: I was able to interview her daughter, Patty [Cunningham], who is the one that she had prostituted. She [Rosa Lee Cunningham] prostituted Patty when she was, I wanna say she was eight. I, it was, it was pretty awful. And I remember talking to Pattie, and I was like how could you love your mother? This is a question that innumerable people have asked me since I did "Secret Daughter", and I asked it of Patty. And she's like--in fact, I couldn't even get the question out. I was like, after what your mom did to you (laughter), you know--and Patty was, herself, by then, a drug addict, and was in prison actually for attempted murder. And Patty said, "How could I love my mother for, you know, after she turned me out and gave me drugs and, you know, smoked crack with me, you now, how could I love her? I, how could I love her after what she did, and more stuff that you don't even know about, I do love my mother. You know, I would die for my mother. I don't feel like she did that to me. I feel like we was in it together.

Speaker 1: Okay, you've made, I guess you've made or lectured about sexual harassment cases--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: --and what are your thoughts on that? Speaker 2: Yes, well, the case--and I guess I should say for the record that my career has come full circle now because now, in fact, I am a management side lawyer, and I defend big companies (laughter) that are accused of discrimination. And I, and I actually have done a number of lectures on sexual harassment issues because I have won a couple of big cases, very high-profile cases for my clients. But I, but the issue of sexual harassment is one that has really grown in the last 10 or 12 years, in part because people now are recognizing that the kinds of things that women--and by the way, I mean now, men are actually filing lawsuits for sexual harassment. But this is primarily been an issue of, of women and a lack of power that women have in the workplace. And so what I do is we, I do sexual harassment training so that we spend a lot of time at our clients' offices teaching people from, literally, from the C.E.O. to the person that empties the trash, about sexual harassment, about the responsibilities of the company, that the companies have, encouraging people to come forward to make a complaint. The way that the law has been developing in the Supreme Court is that a company really has to have a program, a procedure whereby a person who feels that they've been sexually harassed can make a complaint. If you have that procedure and you have trained your staff and people know that the procedure is there, then a person can't show up at the courthouse door a year later, two years later and say, "Well, I knew about the procedure, but I was afraid." And so what we're really doing is educating the public, that if you feel like you've been sexually harassed, you need to complain to your employer. You need to make them do an investigation. They should do a prompt investigation, and if they find that there is sexual harassment, they need to stop it or else that company is gonna be on the hook for paying big damages to their employees. So I'm, I'm spending a lot of time doing the education and, you know, also occasionally, trying a case every once in a while. Story_ID: 67675 Speaker 1: Okay, and you also deal with, I guess racial discrimination in the workplace, and-- Speaker 2: Absolutely. Speaker 1: --and sexual discrimination. Speaker 2: Absolutely. The, the--every once in a while, I will be talking to, making a lecture, and people will ask me a question that goes something this. "You know, my, you know, my doctor's a woman, this one's a woman. Everywhere I'm surrounded by all these women. Why do we still need these laws on the books?" Well, we still need these laws on the books, and the racial discrimination laws are still on the books because there're still instances where companies are--and sometimes it's not intentional, but sometimes, either in the way that they--either in the way that they execute their hiring policies, and their promotion policies, either result in discriminatory action. And then there's still people out here who have very, very bad, both racial attitudes and attitudes about people on the basis of gender. And so these laws are out here to protect the average employee. It is probably--the problem I think for the, for most employers is that you are held responsible for whatever attitudes your employees bring in the workplace. And that's why an employer has to take the responsibility, has to really take the bull by the horns and make sure that they educate every employee in their workplace to say, "This is an environment where we value the individual, we value diversity. Discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, etc., etc. is not something that we accept. And we find that you're engaging in this kind of activity, you're out of here." And so one of the things that we are doing in terms of the work that we do in the anti-discrimination area, is really using the laws to try and create an environment where people can go in and they can work, and they can do their work. And they can be successful, and hopefully, they can ultimately advance

Speaker 1: Now you leave University of Michigan in, what year is that, 1988 (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I left, I left Ann Arbor [Michigan] in 1991-- Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: --I think it was. And then I finished my dissertation while I was living here in Chicago [Illinois]. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: So, but I moved here in 1991, and that was the moment that Clarence Thomas was being nominated for the [U.S.] Supreme Court. And I was involved in another national mobilization called African American Women in Defense of Ourselves, which really tried to add a different voice to the debate around Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. Anita Hill, of course, was the person that accused him of sexual harassment and almost derailed his appointment to the Supreme Court, and she was vilified as someone, you know, who was not trustworthy--she was making this up, she was trying to bring a black man down--and it was a very simplified formula because, of course, Clarence Thomas had, in many ways betrayed the interests of most black people long before Anita Hill's accusations, which I think were quite credible, came to the fore. Speaker 1: What voices in the black media were putting this case together, that she was dragging down--? Speaker 2: I don't remember all the names. I do remember Orlando Patterson from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wrote a piece in The New York Times which was pretty troubling, describing his take on black male/female relations and framing this alleged sexual harassment in that context. And what his position was, was essentially that this was, that what Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of was a kind of flirtation that was common, and that she should have known that this was harmless flirtation, and not kind of outed him. So, you know, I can't even muster the words to express the extent of my disagreement with that, but that was one pretty vile interpretation. But even people like [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, for example, supported Clarence Thomas initially, and said, "Look, he comes from a poor black background and if he's in there, if he's in the Supreme Court, his experience as a black man growing up in the South under adverse circumstances, that has got to kick in at some point. That has to have an effect on his judgment." And certainly with all due respect to Maya Angelou, that has not proven to be the case. So, anyway, African American Women in Defense of Ourselves was a group of black women. We mobilized people to raise quite a lot of money in a short amount of time for a national newspaper ad campaign which was, it put an ad in The New York Times and a number of African American papers. We raised about fifty thousand dollars, which was a lot for us at the time. I realize it's probably not now. And sixteen hundred women signed a statement that basically said we felt that black women's voices were not being heard, that Anita Hill was being distorted, and it really was not about supporting Anita Hill in a sort of narrow sense as it was confronting all the misrepresentations of race and gender in the discussion around Clarence Thomas. And it was also indicting, you know, his conservative views as not being in the interest of black folks or poor folks. So that was a major mobilization, it took a lot of time and energy, and it was, you know, it was a success, a limited success. But we made a statement and there was an attempt to organize the women who had signed that ad into an organization after that. And there were networks that emerged and sustained themselves, but not for, you know, very long. Story_ID: 635911 Speaker 1: Would you say that what happened to Anita Hill was--kind of tapped a sore spot for the lot of black women that they hadn't really talked about before? Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't say that, actually. I think we had been talking about some of the issues that came out with Anita Hill. I mean, one of the issues was also the way in which race and gender get dichotomized. Sometimes in the press they were saying there are people who support Anita Hill as a woman and there are people who support Clarence Thomas as a man, you know, as a black man, I'm sorry. So there was the idea that there were black issues and then women's issues--and that sort--where does that leave black women? And part of our statement was of course--there's an intersection, as Kimberle Crenshaw [Kimberle Williams Crenshaw] and others have said, there's an intersection between race and gender and class and sexuality, and that we need to understand the relationship of all these things to each other rather than pitting them, you know, against each other, or falsely dividing the categories.

Speaker 1: What have been some of the memorable cases on the Supreme Court [of Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia]? Speaker 2: We--I think for me the overturning of Bowers v. Hardwick [1986]. What this court decided that the case that went up to the U.S. Supreme Court that, where the U.S. Supreme Court said sodomy laws are appropriate, that was a case that emanated out of Georgia in our court. We reversed our decision before the U.S. Supreme Court reversed their decision in Lawrence [v. Texas, 2003] and said that they were wrong. And I was really happy to have spearheaded that in an earlier decision. Speaker 1: Okay. This is a case where some gay people were-- Speaker 2: Were caught engaging in intimacy, and they were arrested for sodomy. And it went all the way up to the Supreme Court and the court said, "Yes, it's appropriate to have sodomy law even with consenting adults in the privacy of their own home." I mean you could be arrested and put in jail for that. And this court overturned our decision. Of course when the U.S. Supreme Court made the decision, it affected all fifty states.

Speaker 1: And I've often wondered about the laws against interracial marriage and so forth. Are they still on the books and such? Speaker 2: No. We, they went, that would have been unconstitutional anyway. But a few years back they went through and cleaned everything. You know, there were slave laws and buggy laws that no one would have enforced, but they were still around you know. So that's--they did a clean effort on that. But we had the Marcus Dixon case [Dixon v. Brown, 2003] here, which I don't know if you know anything about that. That was the y
ung Rome [Georgia], young football player from Rome who was jailed for having sex with a young white woman [Kristie Brown], just recently. Speaker 1: Right, that was on television. Speaker 2: That was on television. Speaker 1: Right, it was national television. Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--take, lost his scholarship [to Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee] and put in jail for ten years. And he was found not guilty of rape and all that, but rape and battery and all these things. But he was found guilty of child molestation, and he was seventeen and the girl was sixteen. So he was jailed for sixteen years because the law--what his offense did within the definition, she was a child and you see what I mean. She's-- Speaker 1: And at seventeen, he was not, a year away from-- Speaker 2: Well even if he had been fourteen, under the law, she was a child. You know it was just a blip, you know you see what I'm saying? Speaker 1: Yeah, right. Speaker 2: She was a child and he molested her. It--and this is getting away from the case 'cause I don't want--if he had been fourteen and she was fifteen, and he fondled her, that's child molestation. I don't know if that's what the legislature meant, you know. But that's what the law said. So you follow (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But if he was fourteen, he would have received a juvenile-- Speaker 2: Probably a juvenile-- Speaker 1: Juvenile sentence-- Speaker 2: That's exactly right. Speaker 1: --instead of a-- Speaker 2: But he was seventeen so he was no longer covered by the-- Speaker 1: So he was tried as an adult. Speaker 2: Exactly. But at fourteen, he could be tried and convicted of the offense, just, he would just be in a different forum, right. That's right. Speaker 1: Okay, so that decision was overturned? Speaker 2: That was overturned.

Speaker 1: We had one case in particular, that was--that still shocks me, where we did a compliance review in North Carolina. And understand we don't need, we didn't need complaints in order to go in and do an investigation, you know. If you worked or you were a federal contractor, you essentially, you waived your rights in some respects, so, we'd go in and do a compliance review and we learned, first of all, in the parking lot, the compliance office said he saw all of these Confederate flags flying so he, he knew he was kind of in trouble. I'm serious. This was 1990s now. He went in and saw the racist graffiti on the bathroom wall and sexist graffiti. He learned that one young man and this company [TIMCO Aviation Services, Inc.] repaired aircraft equipment, for I think the [U.S.] Air Force, gentleman was raffling his grandfather's Ku Klux Klan [KKK] knife on the shop floor. Okay. Yes I was, 1990s? I'm thinking we're talking about the glass ceiling. Speaker 2: Now this is where again? Speaker 1: In Greensboro, North Carolina. Speaker 2: Greensboro, okay. Speaker 1: And women were not spared either. I mean this is kind of a blue collar rough and tumble job I guess. One--it was so bad, I flew down there, and that's not something I ever did, to meet with the CEO. They said a couple of guys had these hoods that they turn around backwards to look like members of the Klan just to scare black people. But the women, I never thought women, four white women, who had just resigned because they couldn't stand it. One was a licensed aircraft mechanic. They said, first of all they didn't allow her to do anything but hand out the tools, and they called them, as the old folks would say, everything but the child of God, including the C word on the shop floor, and these women were in tears because I'm sure these jobs paid well, okay, but they couldn't stand the--it's a hostile environment and sexual harassment straight up. One woman is a story, I'm telling, it's sounds unbelievable, but, I mean I've heard 'em in other parts of the country, so now I'm convinced it really happened. This woman was being harassed by her supervisor and one day, the story goes, he--she was in the elevator with her and grabbed and basically said, "I've got you alone now." They
said the door opened, she keep going and never looked back. She just, you know--I can't stand this anymore, I'm out of here. So I went down there with my colleague from my agency [U.S. Department of Labor] and I said didn't you know this was going on, because the blacks said they tried to meet with him to tell him what was happening, and somewhere in the conversation, he indicated, well, there aren't that many members of the Klan in here. Okay. One is too many. Needless to say, the company was found out of compliance, and of course, they settled, signed a conciliation agreement. Unfortunately, this agency is opposed to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC] couldn't get punitive damages 'cause was a case if ever I had seen one for punitive damages. And after I got back, this gentleman who sounded like an Anglo, if I may so generalize, he said not only were we right in what we found, but there was one guy, the one guy who was a supervisor, they say when he didn't make the meetings, they didn't call him Johnny or Joe, they called him the N, okay. He said the N-word is used all over the place, profusely, okay? They were angry because we always get news releases and the point of that was not to embarrass a company but to show other companies to try to obviously hinder that happening someplace else. It was a way to induce behavioral changes. And they were upset with us, and they called, but hey, that time we did get covered by The Washington Post, in the business section, rarely got covered, but that time we did.

We still have a long way to go and in my view, and if we showed at Labor affirmative action would have prevented that company from having [Ku Klux] Klan rallies for rebels. In where the company had to pay thirty thousand dollars to clean up the walls, it was a small company, I walked through the headquarters and, and, like, you know, in fifteen minutes. If I could, if it was that small, then clearly, surely the CEO should have seen that, and affirmative action rules that you make an effort, an affirmative step to prevent discrimination. He should have had that stuff off the walls. The women shoudn't have been harassed the way they were, and the "N" word certainly shouldn't have been used. One guy was officially fired. The guy who grabbed the woman, you know, but, that's what affirmative action means. You don't just sit by and let aff--and let discrimination happen, wait- waiting for a complaint.

Speaker 1: Wilcher Global [LLC], then you're consulting, you know, with colleges and businesses and-- Speaker 2: Um-hm. And I also do, I'm doing some investigations, Federal, you know, government investigations. We do training and harassment prevention in other areas. I work with colleagues that, for example, do sexual harassment prevention training in the [Washington] D.C. Department of Corrections. There was a major sexual harassment case brought by women, mostly black women, correctional officers, okay? And so again, these are African Americans and I, to the court's credit, they require this sexual harassment training of managers and staff and refresher training, and I think some companies need to take a look at that because not only for sexual harassment purposes, but racial harassment, as we talked about with the [Ku Klux] Klan raffle case in North Carolina. So they need to pay heed. So that's some of the things that we do.

ROSS: So what were your sexually formative experiences like? TOURÃƒÂ‰: In the Party? ROSS: Generally speaking. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, well Ã¢Â€Â“ ROSS: If you want to share. TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. IÃ¢Â€Â™m just going to be real brief on this. My sexual formative experiences were not all that great, because I was raped, and when I was raped I was a virgin, so that didnÃ¢Â€Â™t put me off to a great start. ROSS: How old were you? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I was 16. To me, that made it even more devastating because it was, like, yo
Ã¢Â€Â™re supposed to be Ã¢Â€Âœsweet 16,Ã¢Â€Â you know, so I was really messed up. It was like this dude I was going with and he had joined the service and he had been away for his basic training. He came home in his uniform. He was drunk, and I was babysitting, and I let him come in. And I knew that my mother wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve never approved of me having my boyfriend come over where I was babysitting somewhere. So, you know, that was a bad situation and I grieved that for a long time. But at any rate, that was how my formative situation started off.

ROSS: OK. So, how did you transition from Save the People to doing feminist work? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, you know, we had the bookstore and I had Against Rape, and there was a book prior to Against Rape that was on the topic of rape. And in that area of Northeast, there had been a couple of assaults surrounding the neighborhood where we lived, or where the bookstore was, and weÃ¢Â€Â™d had a couple of meetings where women could come out and talk about it. ROSS: WhoÃ¢Â€Â™s the Ã¢Â€ÂœweÃ¢Â€Â? TOURÃƒÂ‰: We, meaning myself and a couple of other women were Save the People. ROSS: All black women? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: What year was this? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Seventy-four, late Ã¢Â€Â™73, maybe early Ã¢Â€Â™74. And as a result, I was on the radio one day, on WHUR, doing an interview and talking about rape and sexual assault, and some women at the Rape Crisis Center were listening to WHUR. Now that in itself is an intriguing mystery. ROSS: Why were these white women at the Rape Crisis Center listening to this black radio station at Howard University called WHUR? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes, it must have been because Michelle was there. So, anyway, yeah, because Michelle said she heard it, so they had WHUR on and they heard this interview, and they wanted to find Ã¢Â€Â” Oh, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s another black woman in D.C. talking about rape. We must find her. And I got a call from, I believe it was Deb Freidman at the bookstore, and asking me Ã¢Â€Â” introducing herself, she was from the Rape Crisis Center, and asking if I would meet and talk with them about Ã¢Â€Â” and I went and I admit, I was curious. I mean, the Rape Crisis Center. I was curious. I went. We talked. I met Michelle. Michelle asked me to go to American University with her and do a presentation. And that, sort of, was the genesis of the relationship with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. ROSS: So describe to me who Michelle Hudson was. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Michelle Hudson was the community education coordinator. She was black, she was the second Ã¢Â€Â” the Rape Crisis Center started in 1972 and so, we are now up to Ã¢Â€Â™74, so itÃ¢Â€Â™s only been, like, two years. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s very young. Nancy McDonald is the general administrator Ã¢Â€Â” because we try not to be hierarchical, so we have donÃ¢Â€Â™t have an executive director, no executive director at that point in time Ã¢Â€Â” the general administrator, who generally administrates. OK, so we had a general administrator, and the community education coordinator. And because Nancy, had Ã¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™m trying Ã¢Â€Â” there was a reason, OK, the point was that the community education coordinator made more than the general administrator, because they based it around need and not just around title or hierarchy. So it was kind of collective sense of in the beginning, it was very interesting. This little tiny, two-room, upstairs, across from a junior high school, Lincoln Junior High School, up on 16th and Irvin Street. They were in a house across the street, upstairs. So that is how Ã¢Â€Â” that is who Michelle was. She was the community education coordinator. She did a lot of the work of creating the first materials that were used for education and her job was to go out in the D.C. public schools and do presentations on rape and prevention, and that is what she did. ROSS: Did she go on to become the director? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No. She did not. Michelle actually left the Rape Crisis Center and she went to My SisterÃ¢Â€Â™s Place and became the director at My SisterÃ¢Â€Â™s Place, which was a shelter for battered women and their children. SheÃ¢Â€Â™s also KiangaÃ¢Â€Â™s godmother. And from My SisterÃ¢Â€Â™s Place she moved into social service work in education, working first with social services and then in the D.C. public school system. Always a servant. ROSS: Oh, Michelle. Is she still around? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. Her son, who she adopted some years ago, because she thought her biological clock was ticking away, so she adopted a son. ROSS: So when did you start formally working at the Rape Crisis Center, and in what capacity? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I started formally working at the Rape Crisis Center, I believe it was something like October of 1974, because Kianga was born in March of Ã¢Â€Â™75, yeah, so it must have been Ã¢Â€Â” make sure I donÃ¢Â€Â™t have my childÃ¢Â€Â™s dates wrong Ã¢Â€Â” yeah, I think it was October of
1974 that I began working at the Rape Crisis Center. And at first, I was just sort of doing all kinds of things, you know, doing a little hotline stuff, a little community education stuff. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t all Ã¢Â€Â” and really, I think they were sort of preparing me for NancyÃ¢Â€Â™s job, the general administrator, because she was going to leave, and after she left, I became general administrator. ROSS: OK. What was going on in your thinking about black women and the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement at the time? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, child, a lot of things. First of all, I mean, I was very passionate about the issue of rape and sexual assault and women being helped. I was very disturbed by what seemed to me to be the lack of a presence of black women and women of color in the movement. But certainly many of our clients were black women. So what was going on in my mind was one, how to serve women and two, how to get more women of color involved in the Rape Crisis Center and get the Rape Crisis Center more connected with the community, beyond what it was. It was also, initially, in the beginning, it was a learning time for me, you know, to learn exactly what is feminism. You know, how do people define feminism? What is the scope of feminism under that definition? Learning more about pornography, because IÃ¢Â€Â™d never really thought about pornography Ã¢Â€Â” you know, nasty men read pornography at night when nobodyÃ¢Â€Â™s looking, or something. I mean, in terms of thinking of it as an industry that disempowered women or, you know, devalued or objectified, all of that. Those were not really words in my vocabulary or concepts, you know. So my first months at the Rape Crisis Center, first year, was a learning process for me, too. Learning more about feminist thinking and what the issues and the politics of it was. And always trying to see how it fit and integrated in my community, because I certainly saw the urge to try to make people split and choose. If youÃ¢Â€Â™re black, you canÃ¢Â€Â™t be a feminist. If youÃ¢Â€Â™re a feminist, youÃ¢Â€Â™re not black. If youÃ¢Â€Â™re for the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s struggle, then you canÃ¢Â€Â™t be for the peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s struggle. If youÃ¢Â€Â™re for the peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s struggle, then how can you isolate out just the women. All that craziness, you know, just trying to navigate my way through it, figure out what the heck was going on. ROSS: Name some of the black feminists who may have influenced your thinking, you may have encountered in the mid-70s. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh. I mean, certainly people who I was reading, that came more toward, I guess Ã¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™m trying to think. When did I first read something from bell hooks and something from Audre Lorde? I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think that I knew a lot of black women, because I hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t really Ã¢Â€Â” in the rape crisis movement at that time, hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t really come across, you know, hardly any other black women. I mean, I knew about New York Women Against Rape and so I knew some of them had to be something, somebody had to be black or Puerto Rican or something like that. But I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t really know a whole lot about who the women were. Of course, I mean, I heard of like the star feminists at the time, you know, Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan and, um, Bella Abzug and Flo Kennedy, you know, IÃ¢Â€Â™d heard of, but I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t really know a lot about that. ROSS: So at the time, weÃ¢Â€Â™re talking about Ã¢Â€Â™74, Ã¢Â€Â™75, Ã¢Â€Â™76, what was the Rape Crisis Center doing vis-Ãƒ -vis black women in terms of outreach to or work with or Ã¢Â€Â“ TOURÃƒÂ‰: Talking about it. Even though they always made a concerted effort to bring black women onto the staff, they really felt that going into the schools or education should be a black woman, because thatÃ¢Â€Â™s mainly who was going to be in those schools, that that was in the staff, there should be black women. There was really a problem recruiting. There seemed to be a problem to recruit black people onto the board of directors, you know, who came or who actually stayed. So for the most part, most of the time, for a really long time, the board was always Ã¢Â€Â” basically, it was white, as was, now, in Ã¢Â€Â™76, when we went with CETA and VISTA, you know, and CETA was the concentrated employment program [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act], so that brought us quite a few women of color, and then VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, that brought us Ã¢Â€Â” so that was the time when we had the largest women-of-color staff. We had Latino women, because we wanted to do work in Addams, which was a predominantly Latino community, to assess the attitudes about rape and what kind of services and what people did there, and the same in the black community. So, we had, like, three or four Latino sisters and about six black women that came on specifically through CETA and VISTA. I think the main way that the Rape Crisis Center at the time was reaching the black community was through the services provided for clients. They were just always aware that they were very lacking and very short in terms of the relationships and the networks et cetera to be a crisis center in the District of Columbia. ROSS: Well, youÃ¢Â€Â™re probably one of the few women that weÃ¢Â€Â™ll interview for this oral history project who could probably tell the story and remember the story of how the Rape Crisis Center was founded, even though you were not there in those early years, but IÃ¢Â€Â™m sure youÃ¢Â€Â™ve had to tell it a few times. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, IÃ¢Â€Â™ve had to tell it a few times. ROSS: So maybe we could capture it for the record now? TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. As I recall, there was, in 1970 or Ã¢Â€Â™71, there was this big womenÃ¢Â€Â™s speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillenÃ¢Â€Â™s apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My SisterÃ¢Â€Â™s Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power. All the things that everyone criticized women for having as part of an analysis of violence against women Ã¢Â€Â” who now, the mainstream themselves, embrace a large part of that ideology or that perspective, that politic, or that analysis, however you want to say it, about that, that they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t do before, Post Traumatic Stress [Disorder], you know, rape trauma syndrome, just any number of things that the women were saying in Ã¢Â€Â™72, Ã¢Â€Â™73, Ã¢Â€Â™74 went on for so long, that the more traditional society, law enforcement, medical, social, was rejecting all of that, have now had to come around and embrace it. And not just embrace it, but kind of like take it over and claim it, like this was their thinking, their theory, all along and all the time, which was just so outrageous, such revisionist history. In that house, in that apartment on Q Street, and it stayed there in JackieÃ¢Â€Â™s apartment for some time. And from JackieÃ¢Â€Â™s apartment, the first place it went was to that small, two-room across the street from Lincoln Junior High School on 16th and Irvin Street. ROSS: OK. There were some feminist magazines, and wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t there a group called the D.C. Area Feminists Alliance? TOURÃƒÂ‰: FAAR. ROSS: Feminist [Alliance] Against Rape. Tell me about FAAR and Ã¢Â€Â“ TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, FAAR was Ã¢Â€Â” some of the women in FAAR were from the Rape Crisis Center who had left the Rape Crisis Center, wanted to do something else or do some things differently, and so there were people who were interested in publishing, and they got interested because there was also a quarterly scholarly magazine called Quest. Quest preceded FAAR, you know, because it was more scholarly, a quarterly and all that. So you had women who worked on Quest who were interested in putting some focus around rape and so forth, and you had women who had been at the Rape Crisis Center who had an interest in putting out written materials and educating in that way, so they got FAAR magazine. The thing IÃ¢Â€Â™m trying to remember, because it had two incarnations, as FAAR and as Aegis magazine. And actually, what I think is that they became FAAR the collective. The magazine was Aegis magazine, and it carried articles and information on sexual assault and theory around sexual assault, you know, all kinds of tips, this, that, the other, different stuff, stories, articles that had to do with empowering women and all of that. Later, Aegis joined with Ã¢Â€Â” oh, yes, and of course, dealing with pornography as well. Later, Aegis joined with domestic violence and half the magazine would deal with issues related to sexual assault, pornography, and the other half would deal with issues dealing with battering and domestic violence. ROSS: Did you get the sense that in the early years, the people at the Rape Crisis Center worked on other forms of violence that women experienced, or was it just gender-based violence? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It was gender-based violence. However, definitely gender based, although the Center did recognize that it was possible for a man to be raped, it was obviously not the primary focus, but there was certainly the acknowledgment that men could be sexually assaulted. You had individuals who worked at the enter who may have had involvement and ties into other movements around other issues, but the Crisis Center was strictly dealing with rape and had its hands full to deal with that, because in Ã¢Â€Â™72 and Ã¢Â€Â™75, I mean, the police, everybody, I mean, it was a battle. You know, if we Ã¢Â€Â” it still continues to be a struggle, you know, but it was a battle. It was a war, you know, in terms of they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want you to have companions. I mean, all rape crisis centers, now you can have a companion with the woman at the hospital thatÃ¢Â€Â™s from the center. So, Oh, no, you couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t do that. They didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want you there because you impeded the investigation by being there. So then it was, like, the only way you could be there was if the woman requested that you be there. I mean, it was all these things, you know. Women asked for it. It was just horrendous. So they werenÃ¢Â€Â™t just dealing Ã¢Â€Â” they were not really making connections to anything else. They were dealing with the dynamics of gender, you know, and as time moves forward, began to Ã¢Â€Â” around different issues, make connections, broaden out Ã¢Â€Â“ ROSS: OK. Now, youÃ¢Â€Â™re saying that your working at the Rape Crisis Center affected your marriage. In what way did your consciousness that you developed at the Center cause you to re-look at your marriage? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t working at the Rape Crisis Center that caused me to Ã¢Â€Â” I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t need Rape Crisis Center. I mean, in all honesty, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t need the Rape Crisis Center to help me with that at all. When I was saying, working, I meant working in terms of the finances of it. You know, where if the man doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t have a regular job or steady job and you do even just part-time, full-time, whatever it is, the dynamics that that creates. No, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t a consciousness from the Rape Crisis Center. It was just the consciousness of, you got to go, because somebodyÃ¢Â€Â™s going to get hurt, OK. And so, I ainÃ¢Â€Â™t fit for it to be me, so, and youÃ¢Â€Â™re not leaving my child no place else, so you got to go. RO
S: So your marriage to Patrice broke up Ã¢Â€Â” what year again? TOURÃƒÂ‰: In actuality, in 1979. We decided that we would finish out that Kwaanza and that was going to be it. ROSS: OK. So we havenÃ¢Â€Â™t gotten to Ã¢Â€Â™79 yet. So, how did you get into housing work? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, housing work. I first got into the housing work while I was at the Crisis Center. I mean, I had done a little stuff before, but that was just around in the neighborhood and that just had to do with people maybe knowing what their rights were or, you know, helping somebody who was dealing with a slum lord, and that was to save the people. There was no movement and there was no focus on housing or anything like that. But when I was at the Center, I met this woman named Emma DÃ¢Â€Â™Angelo, Puerto Rican sister named Emma DÃ¢Â€Â™Angelo, who was working at the Center, and she was doing housing work. She was real interested in doing housing work. And I had some, you know, but we had been working on that survey in neighborhoods, like the safety of neighborhoods, the attitudes about it, so I had come to be able to see more safety issues around housing and stuff like that. But Ami had asked me to go to a Ã¢Â€Â” I think she asked me to go to a tenant meeting with her, yeah. Because also, two other women, Maureen and BJ, were working on housing at the Center, on the neighborhood stuff around housing, and so from that, they had somehow, they had also gotten into using that as a way for the people to help organize tenants, just safety issues so they donÃ¢Â€Â™t get raped and stuff like that.

IÃ¢Â€Â™ve forgotten, where that church was, where City Wide used to have its meetings, and I remember your asking Ã¢Â€Â“ TOURÃƒÂ‰: By Columbia Road, like 15th and Columbia. The church where the sister was the minister? The black woman who was the minister? The church where we had the Third World Women? ROSS: No. It was further up the street, near 15th and U. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Down. ROSS: Further down, further towards downtown. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Not All Souls? ROSS: No, of course, I would remember All Souls. It was, oh, it was a denomination like Lutheran or Episcopalian, or Ã¢Â€Â“ TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, OK, OK, like Augustan or something. ROSS: St. Augustine. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Exactly. ROSS: ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s exactly it. I would have never pulled that name out of the hat, but I just remember meeting this very compelling woman Ã¢Â€Â“ TOURÃƒÂ‰: That was me, OK. ROSS: Ã¢Â€Â“ about Ã¢Â€Â™78 or so, talking about the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yeah. ROSS: But weÃ¢Â€Â™d met at a housing meeting. TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. ROSS: IÃ¢Â€Â™m sorry, this is not my story, itÃ¢Â€Â™s yours. TOURÃƒÂ‰: But thatÃ¢Â€Â™s very helpful. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s very, very helpful, because I know it was definitely, it was pre- the Rape Crisis Center, but it was right after the Rape Crisis Center that, when you came to the Rape Crisis Center, right around that time, that you proposed me for the Study Group. ROSS: Right. So itÃ¢Â€Â™s all kind of Ã¢Â€Â” our stories are rather interconnected from then on, but, IÃ¢Â€Â™d be fascinated to hear the pre-1978 story of Nkenge. In terms of, well, you stayed at the Rape Crisis Center for 13 years until 1988. In that time you had a variety of jobs. Tell me about some of the more significant things that you did at the Rape Crisis Center. You certainly pioneered quite a bit. TOURÃƒÂ‰: I did do a lot of things at the Rape Crisis Center, speaking with all humility and truth. Once I came back, I became the director for community education. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the job that I held. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the position that I held until I left. I brought Anti-Rape Week into the Rape Crisis Center, something IÃ¢Â€Â™m really proud of, because it exists today under a different name, but Ã¢Â€Â“ ROSS: What was Anti-Rape Week? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Anti-Rape Week was a massive education week where there were all kinds of workshops, seminars, film showings organized, and we advertised and people would come out to events. So it was to build education to raise prevention awareness, and to recruit people into an awareness of, and hopefully support for, the Crisis Center and to take a look at and become advocates for the issue of sexual assault, rape. So we did Anti-Rape Week, and then the women who were a part of FAAR, Feminists Against Pornography, if that was the right name, organized. The Rape Crisis Center had actually worked and organized the first Take Back the Night march in D.C., which I think was in 1978. I think it was in 1978. And then, the following year, I organized Anti-Rape Week. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think we had a march that year. Then the following year is like when Feminists Against Pornography picked up and decided that that was going to be one of their major things that they would do every year was organize a Take Back The Night march and the Crisis Center would work with them, so we coordinated so that the Take Back the Night march became a part of Anti-Rape Week, either the beginning or the end, you know, a major activity. [As a member of Feminists Against Pornography, Marty Langlen, a white woman, was central to this organizing effort. She also became a member of the Rape Crisis Center board of directors. Another woman with Feminists Against Pornography who did a lot of work was Clarisse.] And Anti-Rape Week evolved into Rape Awareness Week, and then as the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault took up rape awareness, and ultimately had Rape Awareness Month, which the rape crisis centers across the country pretty much observed and organized for that in their communities. The hassle-free zone. There was a lot of street harassment going on in D.C. There was a sister named Linda Leaks, not was, she is, who was in school at the time and she was making a film on street harassment, and she was so impassioned about it Ã¢Â€Â“ ROSS: She is a black woman. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Linda Leaks is a black woman who was making a film on sexual harass[ment] Ã¢Â€Â” street harassment, and Linda was so impassioned about it that she also created a t-shirt to stop violence against women, you know, verbal abuse of women. Well, at the time that she was doing that, dealing with the street harassment and kind of strategizing around how to combat it and how to respond to it, white women were also doing some organizing and they had come to the idea that they wanted to make Dupont Circle Ã¢Â€Â” in D.C., Dupont Circle was, is an area that is sort of a hub area for the commercial district downtown and people come there and they eat lunch and walk through, and then, itÃ¢Â€Â™s part of the social life at night. So thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot going on in Dupont Circle and around Dupont Circle. So you can get harassed walking through there or sitting in there and trying to eat your lunch, and all of that. So a group of white women had decided they wanted to be able to not be hassled in Dupont Circle, so they wanted that to be, you know Ã¢Â€Â” My idea was that they could not take Dupont Circle and single out Dupont Circle as a place not to be harassed, that if we were going to try to have a campaign, we needed to wage a campaign to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. So that you would have the right, wherever you were, not to be Ã¢Â€ÂœHey, baby, hey, mama,Ã¢Â€Â all of that kind of nonsense Ã¢Â€Â” Ã¢Â€ÂœWhatÃ¢Â€Â™s your sign? WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s your name?Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” all of that, that you wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have to deal with it. So, we [joined forces and] entered on a real struggle to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. We met with the police, you know, because we wanted to have penalties. We wanted to have it written in law somewhere, you know, penalties around this whole thing. And we worked on it for about two years, but we just couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t really make it happen. It was too big. But in the process, there was a lot of education. We used to have what were called speak-outs, and weÃ¢Â€Â™d just be different places, at a Metro stop on a Friday, in Dupont Circle on a Wednesday, maybe down at the Federal Triangle on a Monday, Easter Market, various places, to do rallies, where people would speak out about street harassment, sexual harassment on the streets, and we would make the interconnections between street harassment and pornography and rape, you know. And we did a lot of consciousness-raising and a lot of great organizing as a result of that in those two years that we worked on that. Also, doing the organizing of the Take Back the Night marches and the Anti-Rape Weeks that we did for a number of years, that is one of the ways that I was able to bring a lot of women of color into the Rape Crisis Center, that came to work and organize around these different issues for Anti-Rape Week. More women of color than the Rape Crisis Center had ever seen collectively in all the years prior to that. Women came in and it was a very exciting process. They volunteered to be on the hotlines and as a result Ã¢Â€Â” and that was all, that was really good stuff. ROSS: Describe, if you donÃ¢Â€Â™t mind me backing up just a little bit, what was going on that caused the 1980 conference to happen, or am I going too far? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, no. YouÃ¢Â€Â™re speaking about the first conference on Third World Women and Violence. It came about because there was that need to pull women of color together, to acknowledge that violence existed in our communities, to talk about the forms that it took, the kinds of responses that we got to it, the attitudes that existed there, and what needed to be done. It also came about because women of color who were doing this work desperately needed to know each other. We needed to network. We needed to build and consolidate a network. And so, though that conference brought about 80 women, you know, in total, however, they came from a lot of different places, and we were able to find out about, like Fatima Cortez, with that little rape crisis center up there in New Bedford or someplace in Massachusetts. We had the New York Women Against Rape come down, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s when we had the great honor to meet and develop our first relationship with Sandra Comacho, Ch
rrÃƒÂ­e Moraga, and those women from New York. The women from Boston came, and so we first met Ã¢Â€Â” not Barbara Ã¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™m trying to remember Ã¢Â€Â” Barbara Bullette was there. It was the woman who was the therapist, Ruth something [Ruth Hall]. But a few women came from Boston. We all Ã¢Â€Â” that was the start of the building and continuation of a network. Those were the first steps towards that. So that was really, that was really a great, a great conference. And it was really exciting. It was part of Ã¢Â€Â” we made it a part of Anti-Rape Week and it was great, and it was where we got Ã¢Â€Â” I believe itÃ¢Â€Â™s where we got our famous logo. ROSS: Tell me about that logo. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Our famous logo which represented Ã¢Â€Â” the Rape Crisis Center had this beautiful logo that ironically, it was done for us by a brother named Malik Edwards, who used to be one of the artists for the Black Panther Party, who drew the pictures for the Panther Speaks newspaper, and we asked Malik if he would develop Ã¢Â€Â” wait, let me back up for one second. IÃ¢Â€Â™m running two thoughts together. IÃ¢Â€Â™m running this thought Ã¢Â€Â” no, I know what it is. The Shanti Dolls. I was getting ready to run it in with ICAW [International Council of African Women] and the Dolls that Beverly did for us. OK. Put that on the side. Malik, who had been in the Black Panther Party, we asked him if he would develop a logo for us for our conference, the Third World Women and Violence Conference, and he drew for us Ã¢Â€Â” he came back with four fertility dolls, one looking Asian, one African born in America, one First Nation, and one Latina, and it was the details on the fertility dolls that determined the ethnicity of each of them. And so these four together represented women of color, and made an extremely powerful statement. So it became the logo for the Third World Women and Violence conference. And then our very next edition of the Rape Crisis Center publication that dealt with myths and facts about rape, we used that logo on it. And it was just Ã¢Â€Â” what can I say? It was a success. Anyone whoever looked at it loved it. Of course, there did come a time, somewhere down the road, where there was conflict when someone said, Ã¢Â€ÂœThereÃ¢Â€Â™s no white doll, you know, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s only four, there should be five dolls.Ã¢Â€Â Why? Ã¢Â€ÂœThereÃ¢Â€Â™s no white woman.Ã¢Â€Â Well, the logo didnÃ¢Â€Â™t change. It didnÃ¢Â€Â™t expand, you know, under the creatorÃ¢Â€Â™s vision. That was his vision of what we had asked him to do for that conference, so that was that. So that is how the Third World Women and Violence Ã¢Â€Â” itÃ¢Â€Â™s called the First National, because it actually was the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence, and we were honored to be the people to put out the call for that. [Deirdre Wright, who worked at the Rape Crisis Center at the time, was conference coordinator.] ROSS: I seem to, with my slippery memory, I remembered more people there than 80 people, so IÃ¢Â€Â™m glad your memory is probably better than mine. But it does indicate that we were very embryonic at the time and yet the relationships formed at that conference seemed to have been sustained over the years. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Indeed. ROSS: Do you remember any audio or video recording of that conference that took place? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I honestly do not, because Ã¢Â€Â” now I am more than certain that we audioed some sessions. The thing is, who in the world, where in the world would the tapes be? I have absolutely no idea. IÃ¢Â€Â™m not sure if we videoed it, because we had hardly no money, but if there was any videoing done, I believe that I have an idea of who wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve been the person to do it for us: a sister by the name of Faye Hebert, who worked in the video department at Howard University and still does, and did a number of things for us all the time. So I would think that she might be our point of reference. ROSS: Well, weÃ¢Â€Â™ll certainly have to contact Faye. Again, this is part of where the story intertwines, but I remember meeting with June Zeitlin, who was then head of the Office of Domestic Violence for HEW and getting a few thousand dollars from her. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Papers. ROSS: To write papers from the proceedings of the conference and some of those papers were published in Aegis, FAAR. TOURÃƒÂ‰: And with them, too. ROSS: And then HEW got a couple of them and what have you. TOURÃƒÂ‰: I actually still have two of those papers. Well, the originals. ROSS: OK. So, why did you leave the Rape Crisis Center? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I left the Rape Crisis Center in August of 1988. To say burnt out is not adequate. It does not begin to describe Ã¢Â€Â” I like to say I was nuked. I was nuked. I just could not Ã¢Â€Â” it had been 13 years, and the last five years of that time had really been Ã¢Â€Â” the last four years of it had really been a lot of battling. A lot of things had changed in the Crisis Center, in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, in the movement against violence against women. As organizations were striving for the dollars, for the funds, then out came the cry of professionalism. We must be professional. So the whole look and feel of the various centers and shelters began to change. The collective Ã¢Â€Â” the idea of collective running and sharing of responsibilities and those sorts of things, were falling to the side, that seeming need to conform without seeing that at the time, the more we conform, the more we were required to conform, and the more we conformed, the more we were required to conform. And so, you had situations in some places where people who had previously been the executive directors were asked to step down because they were lesbian, they were too radical, they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t fit the image for a professional. The boards of directors became more professional, and please understand me, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s nothing wrong with being [professional] organizers. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s a matter of what you define professionalism as being. When it becomes such that you are not just dealing with policy, but you are taking the policy in a direction thatÃ¢Â€Â™s basically the opposite of where it has been, or when you begin to micromanage staff, you begin to have problems. You have a lot of problems. ROSS: Would you define as being more or less feminist, the professionalism? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Less feminist. To me, less feminist. ROSS: Why? What would you define that? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I would say, because it became less political and more social-service oriented. You know, provide the services. And of course, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s got to be services. I mean, whatÃ¢Â€Â™s the Ã¢Â€Â” you need a hotline. You need companions to go to the clinic or the hospital and be able to be there. You need the hospital to agree to allow you have a room there in the hospital where you all can function out of. But when, OK, during that time when more people and more ideas came into the Center -- you had asked the question earlier about making connections with other issues and other movements. That was a period of blossoming, when all that was the kind of Ã¢Â€Â” those kinds of things were going on very strongly, like between Ã¢Â€Â™80 and Ã¢Â€Â™85, Ã¢Â€Â™86 [connections between community organizing, the involvement and leadership of women of color, links with other groups and issues]. But around Ã¢Â€Â™85 and Ã¢Â€Â™86, the connections begin to be disconnected. Stay in your area, you know, this is rape, you know, this is to provide education for the children, talk to people about incest, have incest-survivor groups, have rape-support groups. What does that have to do with the rape of women in Haiti? WeÃ¢Â€Â™re in Washington, D.C. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re in the United States. What does that have to do with the worker rights of women employees who clean buildings? I mean, connections were no longer made. They were not being encouraged. In fact, they were basically discouraged. They may not have been discouraged totally by saying, like, weÃ¢Â€Â™re just not dealing with that. But if it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t get dealt with, if no one wants to talk about it, no one wants to plan around it, no one supports it, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not getting dealt with. The connections are not getting made. And that was very much happening, that kind of moving away from making the interconnections. We are a service-oriented organization. We do education in the schools and we provide counseling. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s what we do, you know. And we go out and speak at the functions in the community, and raise the consciousness at other institutions, and when IÃ¢Â€Â™m saying raise the consciousness, what I actually mean is being made aware of the issues around sexual assault and how to deal with them. And that was pretty much becoming it. So, between board micro-management, not continuing to forge out and make those connections, losing many of the women of color because the issues that would keep the connections were not there, so we were coming to a place of ideological differences and being totally burnt out, because I worked like a Mississippi slave in a cotton field in those years when I worked at the Rape Crisis Center, that I served my community. I was just nuked. I just couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t Ã¢Â€Â” it was time for me to go. ROSS: What was happening nationally on the scene around women of color and violence against women during this time? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, there were some exciting things, because I always looked at it that there was the overall womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement and within the overall womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, there was the women-of-color movement, because over time, many of the women of color had found ways to network and get to know each other and meet each other and do things. One of the things that we were involved in before we were even really very much involved in NCASA [National Committee Against Sexual Assault] was NCADV, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which was much more radical in its thinking and its approach than was the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault. And within NCADV, they had those women of color caucuses, which was so very strong. All of the women, they had the black caucus, the Latina, the Asian, the First Nation, they had all of the Ã¢Â€Â” women of color had caucuses. Well, you know, NCADV was a national organization, so most of the shelters of the country were members of it, and you could see that there were many women of color working in all these shelters, and in crisis centers, which was like something that people just didnÃ¢Â€Â™t seem to know and didnÃ¢Â€Â™t seem to get, that there was all this strength here, and [NCADV], they produced a newsletter, as well as doing a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s newsletter. Some of the shelters did their newsletters, and the women-of-color caucus had a newsletter, and it was very powerful. And what I always appreciated about them was how they could meet as individual groupings and then come back together strong as a women-of-color caucus. So women of color were involved in the shelters, in the rape crisis centers, in the health movement Ã¢Â€Â” because they were also working in the health centers, working with womenÃ¢Â€Â™s health care Ã¢Â€Â” there were a number of cases going on from the 70s into the early 80s that raised a lot of consciousness about violence against women, and those cases were raised and that consciousness was raised through women of color. You had Inez Garcia, who was the Latino woman who was imprisoned for killing a man who was trying to assault her. You had Yvonne Wanrow, who was a Native American sister who, her batterer Ã¢Â€Â” she killed her batterer. You had Joanne Little. You had Dessie Woods, who was a case out of the South of a white insurance salesman who had picked her up to give her a ride who raped her and she killed him. These cases Ã¢Â€Â“ ROSS: And Joanne Little killed a prison guard, did she not? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, I said Dessie Woods. ROSS: But IÃ¢Â€Â™m saying Ã¢Â€Â” JoanneÃ¢Â€Â™s case. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes, yes, who tried to rape her when she was in prison, yes. So these four cases Ã¢Â€Â” Dessie Woods, Joanne Little, Inez Garcia, Yvonne Wanrow, were cases that raised national attention and brought out a lot of the contradictions, the conflict, you know, was played out and so, it was a very educational process for people who were paying attention. And it was signi
icant that these cases, which did so much to further the movement, because it certainly increased ten-fold the dialogue around self-defense, you know, and the right of a woman to self-defense, all of these things. Women of color cases, bringing this to the attention of the nation and of the movement. ROSS: OK. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re going to end this tape here. When we come back, IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to take you back a little bit, because I also recalled that you were pushing a gender analysis within the black nationalist movement as well. So it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t only pushing race and racism within a feminist construct, but the other side of that coin I want to ask you about. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, yeah. ROSS: And then ask you about what you did after the Rape Crisis Center, and weÃ¢Â€Â™ll make that our last tape of tonight. Is that OK? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. END TAPE 3 ________________ TAPE 4 ROSS: This is tape 4 of the Nkenge TourÃƒÂ© interview, December 4, 2004, Washington, D.C. Nkenge, when we left, you had talked about your career at the Rape Crisis Center but something else was also going on. Not where youÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to move discussions of race and racism into a feminist construct, like the Rape Crisis Center, but you were also trying to move issues of gender into your black nationalist activities that you had continued while you were at the Rape Crisis Center. Am I right? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: So, tell me about those, and that work. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, some of that work was [with] the [National] Black United Front [NBUF], which was an organization which was, according to its name, a black united front, a front made up of black organizations working in their communities around the country on social justice issues and issues of police brutality, housing, et cetera. Different issues depending on, also, where the particular chapters of NBUF, as we called it, were located. And NBUF, being rather nationalist in its leaning and perspective, was also very sexist in its leanings and perspectives. ROSS: Could you stop and define black nationalist as you were using it? TOURÃƒÂ‰: IÃ¢Â€Â™m using it as a sense of people who felt that there needed to be a more independent agenda of black people in this country, that everyone was not meant to just live in every city where the particular circumstances relevant to, or context of which they all came out of, the history that led to where people who are in their communities and why the kinds of things that were happening were happening, and all that Ã¢Â€Â” that these people felt that in many ways, people needed to be more independent in terms of businesses, in terms of schools, education, and for some even in terms of where they lived and how they lived. People who embraced the idea of reparations, who embraced culture, your culture, your heritage, your language as it manifested in your clothing, your jewelry, and other kinds of identification as ways that helped to keep you grounded and give you pride. And people who were most assuredly anti-establishment, because they felt that the establishment was at the root cause of the condition that they found themselves in. So black nationalist was kind of the term that I use. And so there was certainly a good deal of sexism as well in the hierarchical structure and how members were treated. And there was a struggle within the Black United Front to have the United Front divided up more into sections rather than committees. And so, you know, you had the stuff on housing, you had sections, a section on police brutality. So women wanted a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s section to address the issues that women were experiencing inside [and outside] of the National Black United Front, and to address some of the issues that women were being confronted with in communities that they lived in. ROSS: What year was the NBUF founded? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I believe that NBUF was founded Ã¢Â€Â” in D.C., we came to NBUF in, like, 1980 or Ã¢Â€Â™81. So IÃ¢Â€Â™m pretty sure it was 1980 that NBUF was founded, and we had the conference at Howard University, which is where I met a lot of people who were good people, interesting people. One of the reasons that I made a conscious choice to go ahead and deal with the Black United Front was because what I had found, was that in the time I had worked at the Rape Crisis Center, I had really developed some negative feelings about men, and I found it kind of coloring my attitudes, you know, because I had so much rape and so much pornography and domestic violence, and harassment, you know. It was, like, put them all in a plane and send them somewhere by themselves, you know. And of course, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like, OK, you know, your brotherÃ¢Â€Â™s going up too, your nephews are going, they all are going. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s, like, OK, send somebody elseÃ¢Â€Â™s father and husbands and OK, so I need to be able to be more consciously connected with men, with the other half of the planet, and engaged in how you work things out, because the solution is not for them all going to another planet, and IÃ¢Â€Â™m feeling pretty tired when IÃ¢Â€Â™m saying, just send them all to another planet, because IÃ¢Â€Â™m just tired. So as this line from one of the first shows when Living Single, when Queen LatifahÃ¢Â€Â™s show first started, and they were talking about what would life be without men, which of course was raised by Regine, and Queen LatifahÃ¢Â€Â™s reply was something like Ã¢Â€Âœa planet full of fat, happy women.Ã¢Â€Â So itÃ¢Â€Â™s like, OK, so I made a conscious choice to make sure that I reconnected and in that way, I could do my broader social work within the community and I could stay connected with the whole community, and I knew that that meant that weÃ¢Â€Â™d have to engage in struggle around the whole thing of sexism. And so, those kinds of struggles were going on. And the women in NBUF did get a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s section, and it was a lot of struggle to get it. As you may recall, there was a lot of struggle to get that, and a lot of guys, brothers, men feeling threatened for no reason. A very interesting thing in terms of Ã¢Â€Â” which really highlights some of the struggle around the issues of sexism Ã¢Â€Â” was the question of the participation of NBUF in the Decade for Women Conference. It was just so unbelievable, some attitudes that it was a waste of time to go there. Why are you going there? ItÃ¢Â€Â™s just a whole bunch of women from all over the world just to come to talk about whatever they come to talk about. Come to talk about nothing. All the feminists, these feminists when they come, itÃ¢Â€Â™s just all about, you know, taking the man down. I mean, there was just all these kinds of attitudes about whether NBUF would participate, and the women of NBUF and what would be the role of women in NBUF, you know. And there were a few really prominent women in the Chicago area who were speaking at one of our conferences, you know, that really kind of held that opinion that this was a more feminist thing than anything else, and they werenÃ¢Â€Â™t really clear if it was worth our effort, or the energy of women from NBUF to be a part of this. And then they all found out that the great and honorable Queen Mother Moore was going to Kenya, to Nairobi, Kenya, for the World Decade of Women Conference, and for those who are in that community, in that culture, the black nationalists, pan-Africanist community, know that Queen Mother Moore, Audrey Moore, had been a fighter since her teens, and she was well on her way to her eighties then. From her teens, she knew Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Du Bois. I mean, she walked with the greats, as they say, stomping with the big dogs, you know, always committed to the empowerment and the progress of black people, the furtherance of pan-Africanism around the world. And she felt that this was important, and it really threw a lot of people Ã¢Â€Â” it worked for us, it was very helpful for us, but it really threw a lot of people. That was one example of just the whole thing around, How are people going to get there? How are they going to pay? How important is it? All the dynamics of all of that to me was one of the things that if you could look at and see sexism, and you could see lack of understanding of these issues and how these issues connect, the struggle to have a woman section was indicative of that. Within other, just in the community in general, if I was working with people maybe around issues, something that had to do maybe with, if it had to do with housing, if it had to do with neighborhood safety, whatever it was, however it was that something came up dealing with women, it always kind of came up with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the feminists. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s that womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement. What are you for, you know, are you for the black movement? Are you for the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement? Are you for the people or are you for the women? I mean, all those kinds of things that youÃ¢Â€Â™d be forced -- And there was this case that came up, and for the love of God, I may be blocking, because it was so stressful, but I may be blocking it not because I just havenÃ¢Â€Â™t thought about it in an long time Ã¢Â€Â” there was one of the churches, like United Church. IÃ¢Â€Â™m just going to leave it at that, because it might not be right and I donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to tell somebodyÃ¢Â€Â™s church out there and be wrong. But here in D.C., one of the larger churches and the minister was accused of sexual harassment. And there were four women, and they were really, really upset and traumatized. And they were directed to, not just the Rape Crisis Center, they were directed to me, to work with them and support them and sit in on some of their meetings and so forth and so on. And this guy was actually charged, you know, with sexual harassment. And in the church, he ultimately, even though it was kind of close, but he ultimately won. Oh, no, not Ã¢Â€Â” you know. In the process, though, working with these women was just really Ã¢Â€Â” it was horrendous. And because the case was in the newspaper and that sort of thing. I was getting criticized, you know, for bringing down a good man, for messing with somebodyÃ¢Â€Â™s reputation or getting into the middle of something that wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t that serious. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not like he raped anybody, that sort of thing. And I can clearly remember one day, I was Ã¢Â€Â” two particular occasions. One, there was a man and woman together somewhere up in Northwest, and he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœArenÃ¢Â€Â™t you the woman at the Rape Crisis Center thatÃ¢Â€Â™s working with the women?Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœYes, I am.Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœHow are you going to just tear a black man down?Ã¢Â€Â Kind of went into this, right? And the woman, the sister who was with him, she kind of pulled him up, you know, she was kind of, like, Why donÃ¢Â€Â™t you leave her alone? SheÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€Â” weÃ¢Â€Â™re out here doing, to go to the movies. Why are you doing this? kind of thing. Which was the first time that I sort of realized, my goodness, this is kind of bigger than I realized it was. And then, I was walking across Malcolm X Park, and this guy says, Ã¢Â€ÂœArenÃ¢Â€Â™t you the woman whoÃ¢Â€Â™s helping those women against John?Ã¢Â€Â His first name was John, I cannot remember his last name. I could go back and look this stuff up because I know I have it somewhere. And I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYes.Ã¢Â€Â And he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, whatÃ¢Â€Â™s wrong with you? Do you like men?Ã¢Â€Â And I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo.Ã¢Â€Â And he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, because youÃ¢Â€Â™re a lesbian.Ã¢Â€Â What I really meant was I donÃ¢Â€Â™t like men like you, you know, small-minded and aggressive and rude. So, he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYouÃ¢Â€Â™re a lesbian.Ã¢Â€Â And so I just said something like, Ã¢Â€ÂœYouÃ¢Â€Â™d better watch your girlfriend,Ã¢Â€Â because he just pissed me off. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know. But that was really stressful, and people at the Crisis Center really didnÃ¢Â€Â™t realize how significant this was that was going on. [The case of a woman suing a minister became a major polarizing issue in the black community.] Because this is, like, an out-in-the-open thing around sexual harassment, verbal sexual harassment stuff. You know, a little pat on the behind, this, that, and the other, that people had always known about in different places where they hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t come out like that Ã¢Â€Â“ ROSS: This was before Anita Hill. TOUR
ƒÂ‰: Yes, oh, yes. You know, so this was kind of like, out there, so I had to put a lot of energy into it and it was very stressful.

I even remember once, in terms of violence against women, particularly violence against black women, that people may recall, depending on their age, that people did not always freely walk around flinging their braids and their cornrows. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s not how it was. How it was is that in many instances, if you worked on a job, your employers did not want you to wear cornrows to work. If you did wear cornrows, they only wanted a certain way for them to be braided, you know, to go back, no fancy styles, just plain, no adornment or anything on them, you know, professional. And their claim was that cornrows were not professional. There was a woman, her name was Cheryl Tatum, and there was another sister whose name I cannot remember, each worked at a hotel, and the hotel was going to fire them. Cheryl Tatum worked at Marriott Ã¢Â€Â” there, I said it Ã¢Â€Â” the Marriott Hotel in the age where they did not want people to wear cornrows to work. That would of course be black women, because we were the only ones wearing the cornrows. And they had threatened to fire Cheryl Tatum and this other sister at the other hotel. So she was raising, she was making a fight of it, and she was letting it be known in the community that they had threatened to fire her and her job was on the line. I believe that maybe in some other city, on the other side of the country, somebody had filed a suit against a hotel behind them wanting them to take the braids out. So I thought about it and I decided that, I determined that MarriottÃ¢Â€Â™s demand that Cheryl Tatum remove her braids or lose her job was a form of violence against women, that it was psychological violence against women. It was an attack on my image to tell me that cornrows, which were a part of my culture, cultural expression, was not professional, and that there was something wrong with wearing cornrows, and I felt that this had a negative psychological impact on me as a woman, and I felt that it was a form of corporate violence against women. It was psychological violence. And so I set out and organized a major demonstration in support of Cheryl Tatum and the right of women to wear cornrows to work at the Marriott and any damn place else that they wanted to wear them at. And some of the members of the Rape Crisis Center board had a problem with that. Th
y felt that I was going a little too far, that it was quite a stretch to see that action by the hotel as a form of violence against women. I felt that it was quite short-sighted on their part not to be able to see it and make that connection.

Then certainly the level of how this plays itself out in terms of racism, and then how it plays itself out in relationship to the politics of gender, you know, of how, as a woman in these economic times you could see that these might be the particular ways in which you are abused. YouÃ¢Â€Â™re a woman who got sexually assaulted for some crack, you know, and ended up with somebody who kept you captive for three days, kept you locked up in a closet, take you out of the closet to use you, put you back in the closet, let you go on Monday morning, and, oh, out of a good thing, go ahead and give you a little bag to go, you know, a little bag of rock to go, you know. You donÃ¢Â€Â™t have Blue Cross Blue Shield. YouÃ¢Â€Â™re not getting ready to go to therapy and deal with what the hell means for this experience that you just had. YouÃ¢Â€Â™re not going to the police because you were out there engaged in illegal activity. So what does that mean?

 TOURÃƒÂ‰: Wow, what a question. That is quite a question, it really is, in that I really havenÃ¢Â€Â™t Ã¢Â€Â” let me try to articulate that. First of all I would say, to me at this point in my life, 2005, age 54, age 54, that I think that on certain levels, feminism is an ideal. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s an idea and itÃ¢Â€Â™s an ideal. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s an ideal in terms of what a woman might be aspiring to. SheÃ¢Â€Â™s aspiring to be a feminist. SheÃ¢Â€Â™s aspiring to exist within a feminist world, a feminist reality. It is, um, ideas in regard to what kinds of freedoms, opportunities, how that woman is going to be able to live, whatÃ¢Â€Â™s available to her, you know, what she can access and in what ways, how sheÃ¢Â€Â™s seen and viewed in society, and how that view affects really all aspects of your life and your being. So you are striving for that ever so-called thing freedom. You want to be free as a woman, free as a human being, you want to have no limitations on you as a woman in regard to what you can do, what you can do. You donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to have limitations on you in terms of what your rights are within the society, how you are viewed, OK. So then from there, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like, but in reality, this is an ideal because we donÃ¢Â€Â™t have these things, and these are things that we are struggling for in real basic ways, from how my body is being dealt with, how I have control or lack of control over my body, to what kind of contracts, et cetera, I can enter into without having to have a male force there guarantee whatever the particular situation calls for, to how I am perceived and used in that society in regard to things like conflict and aggression in places where women get caught in the middle, as in rape as a weapon of war. All of these different things are things that women are struggling and endeavoring to change, to bring about the justice in that area, the fairness, the equality in those areas. People see how to do that differently. Everybody doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t see achieving that or getting there in the same way. Everybody doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t see all of the same things in regard to what has to be a part of that. They donÃ¢Â€Â™t see that in the same way. People on certain levels are obviously motivated by, and directed by, their experience and their interests, what their interests are, what their stake in it is. So anybody can be a feminist. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s why men can be, you know, they, men can be called feminists, you know Ã¢Â€Â” I kind of find that interesting Ã¢Â€Â” but men can be called feminists, you know. So itÃ¢Â€Â™s a way of thinking and, I guess, an end result that you want to have. So Ã¢Â€Â” ROSS: When did you start using the F word for yourself? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, my goodness. That book called How to Start a Rape Crisis Center [1972] that sort of manual. And it has a part in there where it talks about feminism, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s talking about, you know, feminism is about bringing about change, and a number of other things that are part of this idea of what feminism is. And so, it was one of those little retreat things Ã¢Â€Â” I think Deirdre Wright was there, um, Solaria Catherine, Deb Freidman. It was, we were somewhere like up in, oh, Sperryville, Virginia, with this farm that [had] cows and the farmhouse set up on this hill, and you could see from the top of the hill where the house was, you could see down a mountain, and it was really deserted around there. And it was like all of us up there, women of color, lesbians, white women, we were all (laughs) up there together. And so weÃ¢Â€Â™re having this discussion Ã¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™m not sure, I think Judith Witherow [Native American woman from Appalachia who writes for Sinister Wisdom] might have also been there Ã¢Â€Â” we were having this conversation about feminism. And so I say, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, if feminism is defined as what IÃ¢Â€Â™m seeing here in this How to Start a Rape Crisis Center, then I guess IÃ¢Â€Â™m a feminist.Ã¢Â€Â You know, that was pretty basic

TOURÃƒÂ‰: My relationship with white women in the movement. OK. Well, I worked with white women all through the movement, all through the time from when I very first got involved with the Rape Crisis Center to, uh, I guess up to this very moment, you know. What I found over time for myself and for others was that you came to a point at which you were tired of trying to explain certain things to white women, you came to a place where you were tired of feeling like you needed to take care of them. We canÃ¢Â€Â™t have frank conversations because your feelings might get hurt. You have to be protected. We canÃ¢Â€Â™t say this in front of white women, you know. Well, sheÃ¢Â€Â™s all right, sheÃ¢Â€Â™s not like that. OK, then, she should not take it like that, you know. Or just getting to a place where itÃ¢Â€Â™s like, I cannot take care of any more white women. I cannot explain anything else to any more white women. You know, I have clearly come to a place where I see that, for them to share power is very, very difficult. For them to be able to follow the guidance and leadership of women of color is very difficult. Now of course I start this from the point of understanding that nothing is absolute. So thus, in saying nothing is absolute, it means that this does not apply to all white women, it does not apply to all Jewish women, but it applies to enough, OK?

 But how to marry those things, all of them or any of them, how to marry them together, to think about what those experiences have taught or what those experiences have allowed to happen, I guess in a lot of ways I havenÃ¢Â€Â™t, I havenÃ¢Â€Â™t thought about that. I had been thinking about this Ã¢Â€Â” because IÃ¢Â€Â™m doing this work, because IÃ¢Â€Â™m organizing this program around rape as a weapon of war, itÃ¢Â€Â™s got me thinking a number of things because of these places where these things intersect. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re talking about rape as a weapon of war, youÃ¢Â€Â™re looking at all the various places where there is conflict in the world, on the globe, and what that means for women and children, and particularly, you know, what it means for women in these places of conflict and as it relates to globalization and imperialism and fascism, racism. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s very significant. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re in 2005, so weÃ¢Â€Â™re at the beginning of the 21st century, and at the end of the 20th century, et cetera, so youÃ¢Â€Â™ve been looking at things like what happens with women in conflict, what happened with the women in Bosnia, Kosovo, whatÃ¢Â€Â™s happening in the Sudan, Congo, what happened with Rwanda, Haiti, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Nicaragua. Just sort of start naming places Ã¢Â€Â” Korea, South Korea, Vietnam, the Civil War Ã¢Â€Â” just start naming places, and see and look at the treatment of women and the treatment of children, you know. Why were they treated that way? They were treated that way because they were women. They were treated that way because, in society, all these societies where thereÃ¢Â€Â™s male chauvinism and gender male dominance exists, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re seen as property. So thus, they are used in that way as well to discourage a nation, to make men feel powerless because they were not able to protect part of their greatest treasures of things that they own, you know. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s where we get those sayings like, The hearts of people are not conquered until the hearts of its women are on the ground. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s where, you know, all these different ideas come from in terms of resistance to this, but you see and you know that itÃ¢Â€Â™s true because, if not, why is it happening? When you talk about spoils of war, how is it that women, who are human beings, become a part of the spoils of war, do you know? That you demoralize a village by raping all the women in the village? That you have an idea that you can improve a race of people, lighten them up, make them more worthy, more acceptable by raping the women and having them rape Ã¢Â€Â” like in the Sudan with the Geneina, where theyÃ¢Â€Â™re talking about, you know, YouÃ¢Â€Â™re too black and we need lighter people in the Sudan. YouÃ¢Â€Â™re black, youÃ¢Â€Â™re ugly, you know. So youÃ¢Â€Â™re systematically trying to genocide out a people and bring about a new people Ã¢Â€Â” all of this through the wombs of women. I find this quite disturbing, quite terrifying, as a woman with a womb and a vagina. This kind of bothers me, you know. So you have all these places where these male-dominant attitudes prevail, not just on the level of conflict, but on the internal level within the society where these exist Ã¢Â€Â” in places in Africa where people believe that if you rape a virgin, that itÃ¢Â€Â™ll cure you of AIDS. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like, whatever could you be saying? You know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s this idea in India that if the woman does something she disgraces the whole family and she must be punished, so, you know, we can just set her on fire, because we have to avenge the honor of this family. What are you talking about? These kinds of conflicts that exist even on an internal level within the country, within the tribe, within the society, whatever, you know, women are the ones who are abused, the ones who are traded off and traded for. In a situation where a woman, her husband dies, in some societies where the husband dies so now the woman must marry again, and her family must find her a mate or the husbandÃ¢Â€Â™s brother must step forward and marry her. And all the property now becomes his, you know Ã¢Â€Â” because she canÃ¢Â€Â™t function on her own without her husband? She might be glad to have the first time to be able to roll without him. But here she is now being passed on. So she doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t even count. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s her and her property gets taken over to this next person. All these kinds of situations, you know. So in that kind of an atmosphere, youÃ¢Â€Â™re not necessarily Ã¢Â€Â” not very likely thereÃ¢Â€Â™re going to be a lot of womenÃ¢Â€Â™s centers or battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelters, rape crisis centers, you know, or even kind of support groups that are organizable in an informal way or organized in a more clandestine way, like the Jane Collective used to exist, you know, in different ways. So the idea of being able to have these women Ã¢Â€Â” and then of course in some places, there are centers and there are things, and I guess a lot Ã¢Â€Â” maybe they come out of areas where there are universities, where women have resources at the university level and where the women maybe have more education or something like that. But to be able to kind of work to bring some of that together, so people can create their own, in the way that itÃ¢Â€Â™s going to work where they are, where they live Ã¢Â€Â” to be able to do that, I think that would be a really good thing, interesting and exciting, whatever, very helpful, for sure. ROSS: So you see your future work helping women in other countries deal with the consequences of rape being used as a weapon of war? Taking your experiences from building the movement to end violence against women here and globalizing it from the perspective of women of color? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I see it as something to think about. I mean, the way you just articulated it, you made it sound so good. I mean, the way you articulated it, it sounded really, really, really good and it sounded really organized Ã¢Â€Â” ROSS: Well, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to put words in your mouth. IÃ¢Â€Â™m just trying Ã¢Â€Â” TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, IÃ¢Â€Â™m saying, the way you said it, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what it is, but I mean, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t say it like that. So IÃ¢Â€Â™m saying, you know, the way you said it, it sounds really good, the way you said it. It even sounds fundable, the way you said it. But, yeah, I mean, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s just something that was just kind of like in my mind. And then of course I have a very real affinity for dealing with at-risk young women. Before you actually get to be a full-fledged crack addict that sold your food stamps, that has done so many things that youÃ¢Â€Â™re going to have to be in therapy for, before that, you know, when youÃ¢Â€Â™re that at-risk person whoÃ¢Â€Â™s like between 12 and 17 or something like that Ã¢Â€Â” to be able to work with young women in that group around empowerment, around self-esteem and self-perception and, you know, helping them to tap their potential for school and for other things that would shape them, you know, out of at-risk neighborhoods and communities, I think that thatÃ¢Â€Â™s something thatÃ¢Â€Â™s really critical.

ROSS: Well, what do you think in the future will be the legacy of Nkenge TourÃƒÂ©? What impact will historians be able to say that Nkenge TourÃƒÂ©Ã¢Â€Â™s life had on building a movement for justice? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Wow. Well, first of all, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if herstory can say it or history can say it or whatever. I know one thing is that in the 13 years that I worked at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, I served a lot of people and I helped a lot of people. And I still run into people sometimes who say, you know, I remember when you used to work at the Rape Crisis Center. You were my counselor. Or, You were the counselor for a friend of mine. Things like that. Because I counseled a lot of women when I worked at the Rape Crisis Center, and I feel good about that. Also doing the education in the schools, the program, I run into people who say, I remember when you came to my school. You came to Roosevelt. You came to Paul. You came to Hart. You came to Charles Drew. You came to my school. And that was really good. So I feel that I have touched a number of peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s lives in a personal way that may not ever get broadcast, and sometimes I think about, What if I had not ever worked at the Rape Crisis Center? There would have been these people who wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have got touched in that way that, you know, that you helped them to be able to heal theirselves and resolve their conflicts so their lives could be better. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s really good. Um, I think that the involvement of women of color at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, through the organizing for Anti-Rape Week and working with the people who organized the Take Back the Night marches and the very first Third World Women and Violence conference, national conference, held in this country, that though were only about 75 women or so that attended, it was a significant thing for the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence. I think that I played a significant role in helping to shape and develop a network and a movement of like-minded, feminist-minded, whatever, third world women and women of color in the metropolitan area in doing work in the area of violence against women, you know, kind of coming together to study and to expand around violence against women, because we were looking at sexual assault, domestic violence. We were looking at street harassment, you know, we actually tried to get D.C. declared a hassle-free zone, free of the hassle, sexual, verbal harassment and hassling of women. I worked on the interfamily bill to change the definition and way of dealing with domestic violence and battering, on the rape bill. Just the consciousness of women around being active in gender politics, helping to facilitate this idea that we had to end the silence in our communities, and I think that all of these third world women of color, African American women, women in the Latino community, and so forth and so on, but definitely in the black community, of pushing and making dialog happen in our communities around us when people didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to hear it, you know, and challenging people and their ideas about it. So I think, I believe IÃ¢Â€Â™ve made some contributions in that area, you know, maybe helping to extend how people look at violence against women, like [what] we did with the whole braid thing, when they were wanting to fire these women at the hotel because they were wearing their hair in cornrows, you know. And I said that that was a form of psychological violence against women, and even though I had to sort of struggle with the Rape Crisis Center, the Crisis Center was able to initiate and take the leadership to organize a major demonstration in front of the Marriott Hotel down on 14th Street, where we actually had the unions, a couple of the union locals involved, and had almost a thousand people out there in the streets, including Ras Michael out there in the streets to protest that. ROSS: WhoÃ¢Â€Â™s Ras Michael? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Ras Michael is a brother, a Rastafarian brother who used to live here in D.C. that did a lot of (unclear) and things like that, you know, and the fact that he was out there for that was just ever amazing to me, that he supported that. ROSS: I believe heÃ¢Â€Â™s with the Carter G. Woodson Association for the Study of Black Life, or something like that? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: Is that who youÃ¢Â€Â™re talking about? TOURÃƒÂ‰: He was a part of that, the UNIA [United Negro Improvement Association] and all of that. He has now moved to Florida, but yes. ROSS: OK. So, history will record that you had quite an impact on building the movement to end violence against women, both locally, nationally, and internationally. I seem to recall you telling a story about women from South Africa? TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. ROSS: Maybe youÃ¢Â€Â™re not Ã¢Â€Â” TOURÃƒÂ‰: Maybe you have me confused with some of the people that you know. (laughter) ROSS: No, and it may not be Ã¢Â€Â” 30 years is not easy to remember all that happened. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Thirty years is a while. ROSS: But there was a book called How to Start a Rape Crisis Center. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: These women in South Africa got hold of this book, and I seem to recall when I was at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center that these white women showed up from South Africa. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, the white women from South Africa. ROSS: Wanting to talk Ã¢Â€Â” TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: Ã¢Â€Â” to us about how to start a rape crisis center. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Right. ROSS: And they seemed to be a little surprised because they walked in Ã¢Â€Â” this is my story, maybe Ã¢Â€Â” and they looked at Barbara, who was the white women who was the counselor at the time, and they immediately went to her. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Barbara K Ã¢Â€Â” [Kletzick]. ROSS: Right (laughs). And Barbara pointed over to me and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, you need to talk to her.Ã¢Â€Â And you could see their jaws drop when they realized that they had to talk to this bevy of black women about how to start a rape crisis center. And I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think they were prepared to do that. And I think you were there at that meeting. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s why Ã¢Â€Â” TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yeah, I remember that now. But when you first said South [Africa], my mind immediately went to the indigenous South African people, and so I was like, what? But now, I do remember that, just as I remember that when we went to Kenya for the end-of-the-decade conference, that our rape reference, the one on the myths and the facts and everything, that we had had the logo done with the faces of women of color, that it had spread itself so many places, and that w
en we went, there were people who were somewhat familiar with it. But that once we returned, we just got all kinds of responses from people who had taken it back to their countries and were like using the logo and just using the information. And it was just amazing. It was so great. ROSS: So I think of those as part of your legacy, Nkenge, because certainly you brought me and hundreds of women of color who are now active feminists into the Rape Crisis Center. So whether you think of us as your children or your prodigies or whatever (laughs), never stop to claim the fact that you created a space for women that didnÃ¢Â€Â™t exist before. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yeah, well, yeah. I have to think about that. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve not really thought about it in those terms. And another thing I think that is very Ã¢Â€Â” is that we did the first Anti-Rape Week in, well, it was actually, the first was just a weekend, and it ended with the march that Aegis and FAAR were organizing. That was like in 1978. I remember Sue Lerutes [sp? a white woman at the Rape Crisis Center] did the graphic work for the flyer. That that started out Ã¢Â€Â” it was like a weekend. We called it a week, but it was really a weekend because Ã¢Â€Â” and then it actually grew to being able to be a whole week of activities and so forth and so on that included the march. It included so many different aspects of sexual assault, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s how we were able to pull in so many women of color to work on it. And that, you know, it grew, and that the Rape Crisis Center, they changed to Rape Awareness Week, and then Rape Awareness Week became Rape Awareness Month because of NCASA, the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s still recognized every year. And I feel very, just really kind of amazed about that one when I think about it, you know, from Ã¢Â€Â™78, from a weekend, to what continues to exist now.

We re gonna let her talk about her bill before we kill it. Yeah and of course they did, so there were those kinds of experiences. One of the lessons that I learned from my husband was that I was not so much interested in whether my name was on the bill, but on what happened, and so there were a lot of pieces of legislation that I handled on the floor or I did the roll calls on because I cared about the topic. I worked on th

Did you notice any difference in the culture between the men and the women on the floor and outside of the Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It s a huge difference. For a lot of those guys, they had never worked with women before. If they d been ranchers or they d been farming, they really hadn t had a lot of contact with women. We know that people tend to stay with things that they re familiar and comfortable with, and so there were men there who thumped the Bible and who said that they had a biblical entitlement. I ll never forget a senator on the spousal rape bill saying that if he didn t rape his wife, he d probably never have sex. We were doing a child support bill and a guy in the Senate was saying, Does this mean that, you know, if you have a one-night stand you re responsible for the child? I just can t imagine that, and I thought, You can t be that ignorant. But a lot of it was based on what I clearly believe is misinterpretation of the Bible and ignorance. So when people tend to hang out with folks that are just like them, they re going to hang out with other guys and to throw a woman into that mix, they re really uncomfortable. In fact, I tell people that first I was a member, so I got to go to places that members went. Then I was a girlfriend of Charley Gray, so I got to go to the girlfriend places. Then I was a wife, and I got to go to the wife places, and that made some of them very uncomfortable. You know, men say and do things with one another that they re not always comfortable doing in front of women and quite frankly a lot of them were uncomfortable that I would say things to their wives about what I had seen them doing. I think it s interesting, and perhaps we re not so tolerant of this now, but there was a lot of, Do as I say, not as I do. A lot of the guys who were the biggest religious thumpers on the floor of the House were also the ones who were the most unfaithful to their families, and I didn t have a lot of respect for that then and I have even less tolerance of it now.

Until, and I remember this so vividly, in my third year of medical school when you start being on call and doing rotations I couldn&#8217;t eat with them every Sunday night because sometimes I was on call. . . . I had been on my surgery rotation and I was having dinner with them and I told them some of the things that had happened. And they said that is not true Margie you are making that up. . . . A Hispanic male surgery resident was chief resident who was obnoxious, absolutely horrible, mean, nasty to almost everybody, very very homophobic and one thing came after another and I don&#8217;t know the order in which things actually happened. There was a hairdresser who was very stereotypically gay who was in for a liver transplant and we were standing outside of his room on rounds and he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going in there, he disgusts me. We shouldn&#8217;t be putting a liver into him.&#8221; I remember being a livid and I remember saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you going into that room, don&#8217;t you dare step foot into that room. I&#8217;m going to take care of this guy.&#8221; (She nervously laughs) . . . On this particular day a fairly young guy came in for emergency surgery that was clouting with everything bloody ( ), I don&#8217;t quite remember, we were on a ( ) team. I was, we started the surgery before an attending came so it was ( ), another resident and me. And as they were doing the stuff, you know pulling the retractions and other things, they were trying to make these guy&#8217;s blood squirt at my breasts. They were sort of being competitive in terms of who could hit me closest to my nipple and uhm. Yeah. JMD: And you were the only female in the room? MBS: Yeah I am but there had to be a nurse in there of something, but clearly of the medical team. And finally, you know there is sort of like nothing you can do, you know. An attending finally came and came in and the guy ended up dying. Uhm, they wouldn&#8217;t let me talk to the guy&#8217;s wife. This was sort of the first patient I had that had died and had me go off and do other things. I remember being angry enough that I talked to the attending. And he said it must have been accidental and I said no, this was literally what they were doing and saying. And he did say that that was unacceptable, and after that the guy made it really, really hard for me and I flunked that three weeks of surgery. But in the context I ended up doing fine in the long run and never really showed up in any way...

Right now, I&#8217;m just a little bit upset about how much women are going through in terms of these wars and just the fallout from the natural disasters. A lot of times you&#8217;re talking about jobs and how people are doing, but women are really suffering in the aftermath of the hurricane in Haiti and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The things that women and children have to go through in the world just in terms of who&#8217;s on the bottom of the list in relation to hunger. Who&#8217;s hungry? Who&#8217;s unemployed the most? Who&#8217;s not getting medical care? Who&#8217;s getting laughed at in Haiti when they&#8217;re reporting being raped in the camp that they have to live in because they&#8217;ve lost their homes? Who&#8217;s at the brunt end of the police laughing and not responding and not doing something to help them? It&#8217;s women and children. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s enough progress, even if there is progress. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s at the level of an advanced society.

So the two things at once have really been important to me this year, about the kinds of issues that especially young women are facing&#8211;young people, but especially young women are facing&#8211;on college campuses. I just thought that was old history. [Laughs] SCB: To give the listeners some context, this spring, and last fall as well, several students have filed complaints against the university and now the university is in the process of revising its sexual assault policies to comply with Title IX and the Clery Act and other nondiscrimination policies, which leads me to another question. You&#8217;ve spent your adult life in a time when Title IX has been implemented, and you spoke just now about how it&#8217;s interesting to see how we&#8217;re still struggling with things that should have been over and done. Was Title IX a big event for you, having that in place? AC: Yeah, I was aware of it, but it didn&#8217;t seem like such a big event. It seemed like part of a larger flow of things, a larger, huge change that I felt was so obvious. So clearly I was aware of that but less aware of the kind of backlash that was happening, less aware of the way things were sliding in a different direction, because in particular I felt like we had won these battles. That is, women had won these battles in the &#8217;60s about not re-victimizing survivors of sexual assault. It seemed like we had taught judges and lawyers not to re-victimize survivors in the courtroom and we&#8217;d taught even newspapers and mass media these important lessons, and all of a sudden&#8211;. That&#8217;s why I was so shocked last spring to realize all around me, on a public college campus, these things that I thought were history were very current in terms of re-victimization, and re-victimization by the people I least expected, the university staff. So back to this question, Title IX&#8217;s forty years old, right, and the Clery Act is twenty years old, so it seemed like those broader kinds of shifts and broader kinds of education that had happened around sexual violence and about re-victimization, it seemed so sad and shocking to me that&#8211;. And apparently on lots and lots of public campuses and private campuses this is happening, this epidemic of rape culture is happening, and being permitted by administrators who&#8217;d rather sell their brand and keep things quiet rather than actually protect all students. I don&#8217;t know, it just kind of&#8211;. [Laughs] I&#8217;m still shocked about it. I still don&#8217;t have a way to make sense of all that, other than that I need to be more historical. [Laughs] I need to develop a better sense of how history changes and how&#8211;. I mean I know it&#8217;s this dialectical process and you have to keep pushing, I know that, but in another way I obviously don&#8217;t know that. I obviously can lose sight of that sometimes.

One of them was Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m black and blue from the Rolling Stones and I love it.Ã¢Â€Â That was the ad message that you could see on a billboard, that you could see on a poster in a record store. It was just really demeaning and horrible. It was just romanticizing and glorifying women as somebody to slap around, a sex object. Women who wanted to go into, have a career would meet with a major label executive and be told you have to wear this little short dress, and you have to have this picture in this really sexy stupid way and not, so maybe this is all obvious and known to everybody, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s really different now.

And so itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind of amazing for me that this is 2013 and weÃ¢Â€Â™re fighting these battles over sexual Violence against women, physical Violence against women, womenÃ¢Â€Â™s reproductive rights. I mean women are still by a sigmÃ¯Â¬Âcant portion of the population regarded as inferior to men, and I just wonder linguistically what do we have to do to address this. WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s it going to take? How many dead women do we have to pile up before we realize that weÃ¢Â€Â™ve got blinders up or weÃ¢Â€Â™ve got our fingers in our ears and weÃ¢Â€Â™re saying la-la-la or both? I guess after all these years working with battered women and seeing the challenges they face that are, the initial source is the abuser. But then the state and the various agencies and institutions that she has to interact with to try to get Interview number U-lOO4 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill Gruelle 12 help, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like they drive the getaway car. The abuser commits the act, and then the state allows him to get away with it. So I really donÃ¢Â€Â™t know what itÃ¢Â€Â™s going to take. I hope the film is going to make people stop and think and say, Ã¢Â€ÂœI wonder what goes on in my community. I wonder how battered women are treated in my court. I wonder how the prosecutors handle these cases. I wonder if law enforcement treat these crimes seriously. I wonder if DSS [Department of Social Services] is punitive towards the woman rather than towards the abuser.Ã¢Â€Â

But to be fair to law enforcement this is a frustrating crime to have to deal with because of this emotional link, this bond that the two have. I think for me the thing that makes me the most aggravated is weÃ¢Â€Â™re still stuck in this rut of saying, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhy doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t she just leave?Ã¢Â€Â And that, number one, is a Victim blaming question. Number two, itÃ¢Â€Â™s the wrong question to ask. Number three, itÃ¢Â€Â™s taking the focus of the attention off of him, the offender, and putting it on her. And number four, we donÃ¢Â€Â™t do this with any other kind of crime. I mean when women are beaten up or sexually assaulted, we blame them, just period. But one of the things I've started saying when I go do community ed stuff is, Ã¢Â€Âœthink about the last time a bank got robbed in your community. And law enforcement showed up to investigate the robbery, and they got the evidence and the interviewed people, and then when they were done with the investigation, they probably didnÃ¢Â€Â™t go to the bank president and say why did you keep all that money here. DidnÃ¢Â€Â™t know you were going to get robbed? Do you like getting robbed? WeÃ¢Â€Â™ve been out here four or Ã¯Â¬Âve times already. Why do you still have your doors open? I canÃ¢Â€Â™t believe, you must like this. Do you like to expose your staff to somebody showing up with a gun?Ã¢Â€Â But we donÃ¢Â€Â™t do that. We just donÃ¢Â€Â™t. But for some reason we just reÃ¯Â¬Â‚exively blame women for the Violent acts of men, and that just, itÃ¢Â€Â™s so juvenile. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s so sexist, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s so wrong because when we do that weÃ¢Â€Â™re basically giving him a green light and saying, Ã¢Â€ÂœCarry on. Keep on going on with your Violent and controlling behavior.Ã¢Â€Â WeÃ¢Â€Â™re just going to dump all the responsibility on her. We require her and the children to leave their homes, leave their schools, leave their jobs, leave their family, leave Interview number U-lOO4 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill Gruelle 14 their pets, leave their friends and go hide out in a shelter. And even that doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t guarantee her safety. So we expect battered women and children to reconfigure their lives completely around his Violence and rarely sanction him with any kind of comprehensive sanctions. So thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the area. So weÃ¢Â€Â™ve addressed the law enforcement piece, but I think now itÃ¢Â€Â™s time to address the larger sort of social response to gender based Violence and start to ask a whole new set of questions.

The Courage to Heal had just come out. This was huge. The recovery movement was just getting going and was huge. And the university was off doing very very intellectual very very removed deconstruction, post-feminist theory. SR: Right. MI: Several of my friends said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be a post-feminist in a post-patriarchy.&#8221; There were people with a foot in both worlds. I remember in particular a brilliant grad student who was doing American women&#8217;s history who had come into feminism by volunteering at a battered women&#8217;s shelter. She said, &#8220;I, you know, I&#8217;m starting to think my head will explode. I just, even discussing history, discussing the history of sexual violence, the rest of my community has no connection with what&#8217;s actually going on in the community.&#8221;

 There were women in both groups. It was something like Radical Feminist Organizing Committee said, &#8220;Now why are you working for peace because if war didn&#8217;t exist anymore, women would still be oppressed?&#8221; The only thing you should work on is women&#8217;s oppression and the way you should work on it is directly and politically. And we&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I kind of want to read some books about history and biographies and learn a little more. And I also organize for women&#8217;s rights. What&#8217;s your problem?&#8221; Yeah it was the hardcore separatists, and I&#8217;ve heard a lot of great stuff from separatists. But some took it to such an extreme that they refused to consider that violence against women was a problem because it was perpetrated by men. And because they were envisioning a world in which there were no men, problems that were perpetrated by my were not our proper business or not their proper business. Excuse me? You know, all problems would be solved if we just refused to have men in our lives [60:00]. &#8220;Excuse me. I think lesbians get raped too.&#8221; SR: Right. MI: And of course to the contrary, half the staff at the Rape Crisis Center are lesbians and are standing up for their straight sisters. And half the women protesting abortion rights are lesbian. But there was this for a while that they would say, &#8220;Not our problem. We don&#8217;t deal with men. We&#8217;re cool.&#8221;

I finally did. I started out with skirts and blazers and that type of thing. I think about the ladies and they d dress all over the board sometimes. There are a few ladies who never wore anything but suits, and some are a little bit more casual. I won t tell you her name, but there was a representative who was elected, and she came up there and would wear a blazer, but she would wear these horribly, horribly derogatory t-shirts. They were derogatory against men. They were horrible, and she would come over to us and give us these cartoons that she had copied off 18 Finchum Coleman somewhere. They were horrible, and she would give those to us and say, These are just for us girls. And I m just thinking, Oh my gosh, and I m so dumb I never shared it with any of the guys. After the first year or the first legislative session, she learned because after that she started dressing very professionally. There are a few other people that noticed that, but it was very, very inappropriate. She finally started dressing very professionally and I realized, I need some suits. I ve been told the chamber is always cold. Oh, it s freezing and I would gripe like crazy about those fans and everything, trying to get them to turn the fans down, turn the heat up. In fact, I can even remember I don t know why I keep remembering Kevin Cox, but he went out to his car one time and got a blanket. It was horribly cold, and I guess it s to keep you awake some of the time. One thing I would like to say, just for posterity I guess it was difficult being a woman. It s difficult being a republican woman in the minority. One thing people need to understand is there were some guys out there that were horrible male chauvinists. I knew not to ever get near them and there was one guy I should have filed a sexual harassment suit against once because of his off-color teasing. I knew who I could tease with and who I couldn t, you know. I knew who I could come up and pat on the back and who I couldn t. But women are no different. I m not going to say names, but there was one legislator, she was young and to get what she wanted, she would go to the back of the chamber and hop up on the desk. She wore these real cute little short skirts and she knew what she was doing. She used her sexuality, you know. The men go about it a different way, but the women use their sexuality. I saw this particular representative several times embraced with men. I called it bear hugged, and she knew what she was doing. I thought, You don t need to do that. Then this other representative, she would file all these bills and we d kill them. Then she d come over to the guys and start rubbing her hands all over their backs and saying, If you d just let me bring the bill up for reconsideration if you ll just vote if you ll just give in to my let me bring it back up, and I ll take it back to committee, and she d just rub all over them, and of course they did it. She never did come up with decent bills, I didn t think. I d sit there and watch this going on, and I d go over and I d say, You are so pathetic you are so pathetic that you let her come over here and do this. She managed to get her stuff through. Most of the other women I don t think really did that. There s always a little bit of that feminine thing because we re women and we deal with things differently, but I remember those two. 19 Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman And then there are always rumors but it was difficult being a woman out there because you weren t in the in-group. Like I said at the beginning, I had to go and search out information because they weren t going to give it to me voluntarily. I think that s probably true of most of the women. We had to really fight. But for all those guys that were just horrible, there were some really good guys. I just thought the world of them and they understood that we were all equal out there. Since this is about women I think people need to know, that it goes both ways.

Yes, why not? (Laughs) Go to it. You can all read about someday what I did accomplish. Of course, when I first came up here my first goal was to finish some things that my husband wanted to finish his last term. He had just gotten reelected in 2002 before he became ill. And so one of the programs that took me two sessions to complete was the graduated driver s license for teenagers. He had worked on that for a couple of years so I worked on that pretty hard and we got that done. The other one is a trucking bill that he had and this is one I had a hard time following. (Laughs) So I at least got some other senators involved in it and we were able to get that done. It was to help get kind of a one-stop shop for truckers to get licenses and other things in one agency instead of spread out over two or three, which was just costly and time consuming. So they did get that done. Another group did that. A couple that I haven t finished yet, is on driver s license programs in public schools. We had them for years and now we ve quit having them, then they started coming back and then they re gone again. And that s because of the money and the driver s license education fund. I m going to try to work on that again this year because it s a reimbursement program. If schools don t get reimbursed sufficiently, they re not going to carry the program, pure and simple. So I m going to look at that. Another one that I ve started that Keith did work on some was trying to create a aging department to consolidate all of senior s services because right now they re spread out over six or seven agencies. That just doesn t make any sense to me. This is something very high on senior groups lists your area-wide aging, your silver-haired legislature and other senior groups, AARP, this is pretty high on their list. And so I ve had that bill up there for a couple of years and I m still working on it. I think we re going to see a little movement on it this year, I really do. We ve got some additional groups involved and interested and some more legislators interested in it too. Another one is domestic violence. I ve got a real passion for domestic violence as far as trying to do something about it in Oklahoma. It just gets me that it s still a misdemeanor for a first-time offense. And if anyone knows anything about domestic violence, you know it s happened more than once before it ever gets to court, before there are 20 Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich ever charges filed. It is a violent crime, first and foremost and yet we are not making that first-offense a felony. But yet we re filling up our prisons with all these non-violent offenders. I have a real problem with that. One of the scenarios I use is in Oklahom
 it s a felony to own a fighting rooster or fight dogs but it s a misdemeanor to hit your wife. I am hoping in the time I m here, that Oklahoma is going to stand up and say, Enough is enough. That We re not having any tolerance for domestic violence. And help me push that through the legislature and get that done. In addition to that, it s important to also give some economic security to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. That s another bill that I ve been working on

Well, there are certain votes, there s things that happen kind of quickly that you want to get a pulse on your caucus, where they re at on a particular issue. The Speaker needs to know how his caucus is on a particular issue and uses the Whips to get that feedback from the members of his caucus. And talk a little bit about committees that you ve been on. Well, my first committee assignment was as chairman of the CareerTech Committee. That was a great experience because I learned a lot about that system and what a jewel it is in Oklahoma and how it s recognized worldwide. We have subcommittees now under the new leadership and regular committees, so CareerTech has been incorporated into the Higher Ed Committee and currently I serve on that committee. I chair the subcommittee on Children and Families. I also serve on Human Services and serve on the subcommittee on Criminal Justice. And I chaired last year the task force to stop sexual violence. And then out of the task force you usually come up with bills to present? Yes, and last year we came up with a bill that actually passed and is current law, which I m real pleased with, dealing with the CLEET Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training hours, the CLEET training hours, the police hours. What we found in the course of the task force was that police officers were not sufficiently trained in rape and sexual violence cases, and many times felt a little insecure going to those kinds of when they had to be called in to go to those 12 Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum reports. And so we thought, Wow, we can certainly improve that system by increasing the CLEET hours for sexual violence training. So we ve got, I believe, six hours now in addition to the CLEET hours that we have for all police officers in the state. I think that s a positive change. And we tried to get a coordinating council. There s some ongoing things that we re looking at that we weren t able to implement right away, but as you know, it takes years to make changes. It s a process. It s a process, yes, and I think it s important to keep that perspective.

Well, I guess the first very emotional, controversial hard decision that I voted on was the House Bill 1750. That was the education bill, where they increased taxes to fund education, a very, very controversial bill and just barely passed. And Governor Bellmon was in. I was so pro-education and I wanted to do whatever it took to get the best possible education for our children in the state and I knew that we had to do something. But you had to think at the time that if you voted for a tax increase then you probably wouldn t be back. That was the decision that I had to make. I felt like whether I came back or not, it was the right decision, and that was the most controversial bill. What is very passionate to me and very important to me was partial birth abortion, to stop that. I was the author and it passed. In Oklahoma, there could not be any partial birth abortions performed. Being a democrat woman was very controversial, received a lot of phone calls and a lot of letters about how disappointed they were that I was a woman, number one, and that I was a democrat. But again that was my heart, it was my passion, and I am pro-life. I m very open to the life and death of the mother and incest and rape but as far as just for birth control, I don t agree with that. That s where I stand. Everyone knew where I stood, and that was another issue that was very controversial at the time.

Gardner: Barbara Tannenbaum talking about how it was so important to her that a day like this was happening when she felt like she was always trying to deal with rape and harassment on campus, and people don't always listen or seem to notice and it's so important that women are getting together and showing how much this has to do with and how big this issue was even going on at the time. It was very important to them and they spoke first. And then, I can't remember exactly when the microphone started working, but pretty soon the microphone started working [Laughter]. And um we had someone holding an umbrella for the speaker a lot of the time, people switching off holding the umbrella for the speaker. Um, I wish I could remember who spoke first, but I was one of the first, maybe one of the twelve speakers. And I talked abo
t harassment I had gotten written on my door that year. I had a "Closets Are for Clothes" sign on my dorm room door, I was living in West Quad, I was a Woman Peer Counselor, and someone had written on it, "Rot in hell, you dyke and I'm going come back and rape you because I know you need to be satisfied, you smegma queen." Lamoree: Wow. Gardner: Yeah, that's the wording. I've said it enough times to remember it [Laughter]. And so that had been--that was a little while ago but, and it had happened during spring 8 Ã‚ break, and um I talked about how that was rather upsetting. And I remember there were some fraternity guys that when I was talking about lesbian/gay stuff kind of off to the right who like jeered, you know, which was really, you know, that but all those women there, it was like this complete juxtaposition right in front of me. So that went on. But as the first twelve people spoke, people started piling up, and uhÃ¢Â€Â¦ we expected it to last for an hour and it lasted until five or five-thirty. People justÃ¢Â€Â¦. And I stayed the whole time, I didn't necessarilyÃ¢Â€Â”I didn't plan to spend my afternoon there, and it was just this feeling of people realizing how huge this all was, you know, and Third World women talking about their experiences and how they were different, but related, and how sometimes they got delegitimized in the community because people were always, because racism needs to dealt with and so sometimes the sexism stuff kind of fell behind. And how theyÃ¢Â€Â”I mean, I want to make sure, you know, it wasn't like everyone was like, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe're all women, we're all the same,Ã¢Â€Â but it was like we've all experienced some violence and harassment in this society. Lamoree: There's a commonality in and amongst all of our diversity. Gardner: Yeah, yeah. So it just, it just went on and on. People were crying. People were realizing they had been raped and they hadn't ever realized that they had been raped. There were sorority women or women that were Wriston women realizing, "Hey, what you're saying relates to what happens to me." and you know, on and on and on for five hours

Unlike the other counseling programs, it's not just for freshmen or first year students. It's also for, um, some people live in upper-class dorms, and the outreach programs are targeted at least to try to reach more people than first year students.

And one time, a friend of mine, some kid in the neighborhood, we were walking to the carry out, Dimler's carry out [ph.] at Fairwood [Avenue] and--Fairwood and Livingston [Avenue]. And as we walked behind the alley, and now this--I'm a sheltered kid, didn't go out much, was always an introvert--and I remember this old drunk man exposing himself to us, and being terrified. And, you know, we just ran all the way home. And I don't know if that had an impact on how, how much work I give now. I'd actually never thought about it before now, how much attention I give to kids and abuse issues. But I'll never forget being so terrified of that person and, and never really walking, feeling safe to walk to the store again. That would probably be the earliest memory, and the mayonnaise sandwiches. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, we always ask this question. Now, so did you grow up near Livingston you were saying? Speaker 2: I did, when we were young, I grew up at Fairwood and Livingston. I went, Fairwood Elementary [Fairwood Elementary School; Fairwood Alternative Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] is where I went to kindergarten, and we had an apartment there. And that's probably where I spent--until I was nine years old that was the community we lived in. And then, when my mother married John Porter [ph.], we moved up to the Brittany Hills area [Columbus, Ohio], where Ohio Dominican College [Ohio Dominican University] is. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, now is that a move up in the neighborhood or? Speaker 2: It was, we got a house. John, she married John, and he bought a house so, you know, it was probably about a thousand square foot house and three bedrooms, no air conditioning, but it was a house. We had a basement. We had a backyard. We really thought we were moving up. I actually thought we were middle class until I got to college [Ohio University, Athens, Ohio], and they told me I was underprivileged so (laughter). But, you know, I, I want to go back to that.

And then, the other case we had was a serious case of sex discrimination. They would not allow women to work as correctional officers in maximum security prisons because, apparently, women are so weak, they would have sex with the inmates. And a woman couldn't get promoted to be a warden if she didn't have maximum security experience. So, the, the duplicity of their argument, though, is that, at the same time, they were prosecuting and--or, excuse me, defending a case as to why women couldn't work in maximum security prisons, we had men working in the female prison. And we had female inmates actually getting pregnant. And nobody was saying that men couldn't work in Marysville [Ohio Reformatory for Women, Marysville, Ohio] so, of course, we lost that case.

 Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the cases that came before you that you can talk about? Can you talk about some of them? Speaker 2: Oh, sure. I mean, I, I dealt with any number of cases. We dealt with, not only divorces and dissolutions because we were a combined family court, but my toughest cases were dealing with bind over cases, you know, decisions where you had to, you had to make a decision about whether you help a juvenile in juvenile court or transfer them to adult court. Dealing with children who were raped by their parent's boyfriends or live-ins, some of the horrific abuse that I saw happened to kids. It, it was, it was a challenging court to be on. You can't even begin to imagine what people do, or will allow to be done to their children. It, it was shocking for me. And so, one of the things that I did, as I said to my staff, I said, "You know, look, we know we have six years. I don't know if they're going to give me more than that, but we know we have six." And the one thing I know about black robes is when you put them on, suddenly, the media cares what you have to say. And so, I made it very intentional to talk about abused children and how the system was treating them and pushing for improvement in how we dealt with these cases. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, we live in a time of increasing public scrutiny of certain kinds of crimes of that nature. Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: People abused, 'Oprah Winfrey Show' ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'], or these talk shows-- Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: --talk about these, but you're seeing things at another level. Speaker 2: Oh-- Speaker 1: You're seeing people actually walk in-- Speaker 2: Absolutely. Speaker 1: --on a level of intensity and we, we can't imagine. Speaker 2: I had, I will never forget this. I had a twelve year old who was pregnant by her mother's boyfriend. And the mother kept trying to convince me that he didn't do it. And I said, I finally looked at her, and I said, "Ma'am, we have the DNA. You can try to get your daughter to recant all you want to. That is his baby." And she looked at me, and she said, "Why do you keep babying her about this? She can get over it. I got over it, she can get over it." This is this child's mother, and she forced this twelve year old--and I'm not saying it was the wrong decision, but she did it out of her own
motives. She never asked the child if she wanted to keep her baby. She told her she was giving it up for adoption. She said, "Because I have a baby by this guy, and it's going to be too weird. What, I'm raising my grandbaby who's a sibling to my son? That's not going to happen." So, this twelve year old, tears streaming down her face, not even understanding what's happening to her. She had depression, she was raped by her mother's boyfriend. And her mother, instead of trying to help her own daughter get through it, was there trying to get her daughter to say something that would allow the boyfriend not to go to prison. It, it and then, there were so many examples of that. I can't even begin to tell you. Speaker 1: Yeah, that's unfathomable, you know. You'd think she--what would he have to do for her if they want to get rid of him? I mean, I don't know, I think, you would think that'd be enough, right? Speaker 2: What, for the girl--oh, yeah, for the boyfriend (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) yeah (unclear). Speaker 2: Yeah. I think, you know-- Speaker 1: What could he do? Speaker 2: There are so many women who are so insecure that they would have rather settled for any piece of man than to be by themselves. You know, the one thing I learned growing up with my mother [Sylvia Banks Kendrick] is she said, "There's a difference between being alone and being lonely." She said, "Now, if I'm going to struggle, I'd rather struggle by myself," you know. And so many women would just rather say they have a man, even if it's somebody that abuses their kids or mistreats them. It's a phenomenon I still can't ever get used to. Story_ID: 638614 Speaker 1: Does the court hear--I mean, did the Franklin County court [Franklin County Court of Commons Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations and Juvenile Branch] when you were on the bench work with domestic violence programs and that sort of thing for (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did, we did. But the court, the court can refer women to programs, but unless the woman really sees it as something she needs to go through, it just doesn't sustain. And that was part of our frustration is really--sometimes we'd have court orders over them, like if we had their children in custody, we could order mom into counseling, or into domestic violence treatment. And then, as a consequence of her not going, we could refuse to give her children back. But I had so many moms who didn't want their kids back. If they had to choose, they would choose the guy.

Speaker 2: Well, I left the court to go over to Nationwide Children's Hospital [Columbus Children's Hospital; Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio] because I was in the middle of my second term. The second time I ran, they did not run anybody against me, so people were shocked that I was stepping down. But I'd al- I've always been one of those people guided by, where can I make the biggest difference? And, quite honestly, I was just getting burned out on the court. It was, it, the depravity that I was seeing every day, it just, I wasn't able to leave it at the office. And I'd always promised myself that when I reached the point where I couldn't see the humanity in the person across the bench from me, it was time for me to go. My youngest [David Brown] was four, my middle daughter [Laura Brown] was fourteen. It was time for me to go. And I started having quiet conversations with people, imagining I would just transition to a law firm. And Nationwide Children's, one of my friends was on the board and Nationwide Children's asked me to come and talk to them. And they wanted to create a one stop child abuse center because they had children who were sexually abused, spending hours in the emergency room, sometimes eight, ten, twelve hours waiting on detectives to get there, waiting on children's services to get there. So, they basically said, "This is kind of what we're thinking, but we'd like you with your experience to come in and design it." And so, I literally got the opportunity to plan, program, and build a center from the ground up. They had originally told me I had $3 million. I, I ultimately got $10 million, and we built a forty-two 
housand square foot facility that, now in Franklin County [Ohio], we've been open now for, since 2005 for seven years. So, we have literally changed the paradigm on how you treat abused children. What we did is we moved all of the systems that deal with seriously abused children into one location. This beautiful building looks like you're walking into somebody's living room. It doesn't look like a hospital. It doesn't look institutional. We moved our five child abuse physicians, nurse practitioners, eight trauma treatment therapists, seventeen detectives from our special victims bureau at the Columbus police department [Columbus Division of Police], ten children services investigators, two Franklin County prosecutors, a domestic violence therapist, a child psychiatrist, and the Columbus Coalition Against Family Violence [The Center for Family Safety and Healing, Columbus, Ohio] all in one location, all working together. It took us two years just to get the memorandums of understanding completed. But what--it's amazing what happens when you take six organizations that are used to pointing the finger at each other, which is what they used to do when I was on the bench; the police would blame children's services. Children's services would blame the prosecutor as to why nothing happened. But now, instead of being this anonymous name on a phone message, it's the person you see in the parking lot. It's the person you get coffee with in the morning. So, the beauty of this is that when a child is raped, they come to the center, and everybody they need to see is at the center: the detective's there, the children's services worker is here, the physician is there. We immediately get them into trauma treatment with a therapist. And so, oftentimes, the police detective is able to go and interview the alleged perpetrator before the mom can get home and say, oh, my god, this is what they found. So, it's a wonderful system. It was the work of my life. It's what I thought I was going to end my career doing. And then, Governor Strickland [Ted Strickland] called in 2010 (laughter). Speaker 1: Yeah. For the record, the name of the place is the Center for Child and Family Advocacy [The Center for Family Safety and Healing, Columbus, Ohio]-- Speaker 2: At Nationwide Children's-- Speaker 1: --at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: And this makes so much sense. Is this still going on? Speaker 2: It is. Speaker 1: And has it been replicated in others? Speaker 2: Yeah, we, and we actually weren't the first people to come up with this concept. I mean, there are centers like this that exist. Chicago [Illinois] has one. I went to visit the Chicago one. It's twenty-seven thousand square feet. That's when I knew I had to make it bigger. And Chicago's is a house, it's really kind of whimsical. They have windows that are on the floor, and they have windows that go up outside down, so it's really entertaining for a child to look at. But one of the things I--when I met with the director there, and I asked her, I said, "What would you do if you were doing different--doing it today differently?" She said, "I'd build it bigger." Because what we, what we everybody underestimated, which we got the benefit of their experience, is that when you create a safe place for people to come, where they don't have to go down to the police station, where they don't have to into a hospital emergency room, it makes it easier for people to come forward.

Speaker 2: So much of all of my family is a mystery to me. And so we can talk about it, but a lot of it's gossip, and gossip and rumors, and innuendo. Again, like so many black families. But she--her mother was Mary Lee, and her father was Arthur Page. And her father left before she was born. Her father--I, you know, this is one of those things again, mystery, shrouded. I think he got her mother pregnant when she was fourteen with her sister Rosalie, and then I think they had a shotgun marriage. Which again, in this day and age, would be statutory rape, you know. And now it, and then, but it was a shotgun marriage. And then, so, right after that, the next child came, Ruby, and he was from a family of sixteen kids. And so, again, one of the legends I've heard is that he saw the writing on the wall. We're gonna have a kid every year, I'm not sticking around for this. This is not what I want to do. And so he left before she was born.

Speaker 1: My mother [Ruby Page Schwimmer] was sexually abused by her mother's boyfriend. And they--one of the things I have again about the insights I have on this is later in life, when my mother was in her sixties, she did a lot of writing. And my mother was an English teacher. So she joined writers groups and she wrote a little vignettes, and they were stories. And they were very difficult to read. There's a story about him pounding her head on the sidewalk and bleeding, and her running away and being in a bathtub with just blood all over her. And somebody throwing things and bottles at her head, you know. It's very difficult reading. And I'm sure, much more difficult to live.

April St. John [April St. John Keenoy], and Wayne St. John. Speaker 1: And is April the first? Speaker 2: April's the oldest. Speaker 1: Okay. And where are they now? Speaker 2: My sister is a doctor in Lansing, Michigan. And my brother is--owns a photography business in Charlotte [North Carolina], and they're both doing very well. My sister is actually now working at a methadone clinic, so she's helping addicts get better. Which is wonderful 'cause my sister has struggled a lot over time with, I don't know, anxiety issues and a variety of things. She's struggled a lot, I mean we were both sexually abused as children, and so she struggled a lot with that. And so I think it's a wonderful place for her to be to help other people who are struggling. Again

Speaker 1: She [St. John's mother, Ruby Page Schwimmer] was married then? Speaker 2: So she moved to San Diego [California] with my stepfather, who was Paul Cremaschi, and he was my evil stepfather. You know, he was a--he sexually abused my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I. I, again, these are things you don't realize 'til you're older. So she was in Detroit [Michigan], a single mom with three kids, struggling to make ends meet. When she--I think she was still in school when my father [Lee St. John] first left and she had three babies and she was trying to finish her degree so she could be a teacher. She--the story she told me was that she was told by welfare that if she wanted welfare, she had to quit school. And I--those were the rules back then, I don't know. And she didn't want to, and the only reason, the only way she was able to stay in school was she got a loan from the Jewish Free Loan Society [JFLA]. So again she had, you know, because she had had the connections with the Jewish family, she was able to make this connection and get that help and stay in school, and finish and then get her teaching degree, and she started teaching in Detroit. So Paul Cremaschi came along and married her, and took her to San Diego. And when you think about that, she was, she was twenty-seven, he was sixty-seven when they got married. He was, he was preying on a vulnerable, poor black woman, far away from her family, with two young daughters. He married her and took her further away from anyone she had ever known, and was able to prey. He was able to prey on my sister and I for years without being caught, or stopped, or questioned, or anything. I believe now that this was, you know, something he did to probably hundreds of kids over the--his career, and he targeted us because we were vulnerable. And again, I think that's gotta to be the story of so many young black girls. He was white, but he targeted a vulnerable, poor, single black mother with two daughters. Speaker 1: And did your mother ever know that this was happening? Speaker 2: The hundred thousand dollar question everyone asks. I used to say no. Because you don't want to believe that. I think, probably the best way to say it is she had been so abused, she was fighting so many demons, she was sexually abused in her own childhood, and she never got healing from that. She struggled with so many demons about race, about that. She had seen lynchings when she was younger. She had a lot of difficult stuff going on in her head, and she tended to dissociate. So I remember telling her when I was eighteen that I was abused. And she basically said, "Well, so was I. Get over it, move on." There was not a lot of warmth or sympathy about that. It was, "Move on. I don't really wanna hear it." And, and I think some of that is her guilt, right? She had guilt around it so she just, is like, and her own pain, right? It brings up all her own pain. So she dissociates separate. Years later when I wrote my first book, 'Succeeding Sane' ['Succeeding Sane: Making Room For Joy In A Crazy World,' Bonnie St. John], that was the first time I mentioned in a book that I had been abused. And we were gonna go on 'The Montel Williams Show,' and they called her up and said, "We want you on the show." And you know, they were doing the pre-interview, and they asked her, "When's the first time you heard that she was abused?" And she said, "Well, this show." So she would continually forget. My sister tells a story that she was at an event, it was a community event with lots of people, and my sister said something about being abused. And my mother turned to her and said, "You have abuse in your family?" I mean, there was a dissociation that continuously went on. But the most painful thing for me, when I started doing my own healing work around this, and I started being willing to focus on it honestly, and process some of what had happened. There's a story that my sister tells. I say it's a story, you know, it's, it's true
 She told my mother when she was nine or ten, that something--she got in trouble for doing something. And she said, "This is because, this is what's going on." She was doing something sexually inappropriate, and she said, "This is why." And what she says is that mom said to her, "Well, has it stopped? Is it not going on anymore? Okay, well then, forget about it." Basically, the same thing she said to me when I was eighteen, she said to April when she was nine. And I had heard that story, and I thought it was horrible. But I didn't really process it, and it wasn't until I was in my thirties, wasn't until I was in my thirties that I did the math. If my sister was nine or ten, I was still being abused and nobody asked. Nobody checked. 'Cause I was abused from the age of two to the age of seven. And so this question of, did my mother know, is complex. She had, she had issues. Story_ID: 521602 Speaker 1: How did it stop? Speaker 2: I went to therapy when my daughter [Darcy Deane] was young, and I had to. I had, what I had done, okay. I had literally forgotten about it. I had forgotten, erased the memories from the time that it happened until I was eighteen. And what happened when I was eighteen is my stepfather [Paul Cremaschi] died. And I've come to understand, if you read about it, that this is a common thing. That when the perpetrator dies, you feel safe enough to bring the memories back. And so, it's the weirdest thing, because it's not like one day you wake up and go, "Ah. I was abused. Ah!" You know, it's like the best way I can explain of what it occurs, how it occurs in your brain is it's like a path. Imagine that you live in a neighborhood and you walk around the neighborhood, and there's this road, dirt road that kind of goes off. And you just haven't walked down that path in a long time. You know it's there, you know you were down there years ago, you know it's there, you just never think about it. And so you walk past every day and you never go. And then all of a sudden, when you're eighteen and you walk down that path, and you go, "Oh, yeah. I always knew this was here, but I just never went." And so it doesn't shock you. It doesn't surprise you. You just realize, "I remember this, and I haven't remembered it for ten years." Anyway, it just, I know if people haven't experience that, it's just impossible to imagine. But at eighteen, I remembered that I was sexually abused. And I only remembered little snippets of it, but I talked to my mom [Ruby Page Schwimmer] about it. But it wasn't until I had my own daughter that it started to become a real problem for me. So I just shut it down, I just, my mom said, "Don't think about it." I said, "Okay." But once I had my own daughter, the pain started to bubble up in many ways, and I didn't realize that that was what was happening at first. But things like, when she would come home after school, I would black out. Because that's when I would be abused, is every day when I came home from school, and he was there and my mother was at work. And so there were, there were things--and I say blackout. Like, we'd be playing and I would just fall asleep. And I didn't, this would repeatedly happen in the middle of the afternoon. And it's, you know, it's crazy stuff is happening, and the anxiety was coming up, and it took me a while to put together what it was. And that if I wanted to be a mother, I needed to treat it. And I think that's one of the things when I look back, my mother never did the healing work. And that's part of the reason why she missed all the signs and she couldn't, you know, and I realized, if I don't do my healing work, my daughter could be abused and I might fall asleep and miss it. (Laughter) You know? So I was motivated to do the work. And some people, you know, I am a strong person of faith. And I think for me, at that time, I was working on my prayer life a lot, and that gave me the strength to do the work. But I don't believe, some people believe if you just forgive the past, and pray, you're done. I had to do more than that. Maybe that works for some people, but I had to go to therapy, I went to a hypnotist that took me back, so that's why I know that it ended when I was seven. I'm sorry, you asked me, "How did it end?" And I know this because I went into therapy and because I did the hypnosis. Gosh, this is hard. So he had been abusing me for years. He had been playing little sex games with me after school, when I would come home from school. And, and, especially when I was in kindergarten, you know, I'd get home earlier than my brothers and sisters. You know, he was able to have time alone with me. And I think one of the unwritten rules was that no one spoke. That you didn't speak when these things, the unspeakable, right? Because nobody spoke. When I was seven, I said something and he immediately stopped his activities and left, and it never happened again. Okay, this is the really hard part. So in the hypnosis, I had to go back and relive some of these things. And it was very judicious about the healing. About--because what you're trying to do is go back and unpack what happened, and what you learned to believe because of the things that happened. And you want to be able to undo that process of creating false beliefs about yourself and about the world. And, which would be things like you don't matter, and you don't have any value, and your value is only as to pleasure somebody else, you know? You have to undo all these beliefs. I felt like it was a process of, like the Greek myth, when Hercules goes back into Hades and goes in to save someone and pull them out. That I had to do these therapy sessions, to go back and find this child and bring them out of Hell. It was a very difficult period. Story_ID: 521603 Speaker 1: But reliving that memory of the last time he sexually abused me (crying), the most horrible part about it is that the child became very depressed. Because as a child, I was sad that the abuse stopped. Because it was a feeling of affection and warmth and love and it was, I don't know, it was normal. It was what was there. And so I thought I had done something wrong. That was the third grade, and I got all Cs in third grade. I was always a straight A student through my whole life, and I remember I got all Cs in third grade. And I think, I never put it together, until much later, until I did this hypnosis and I understood. I became a very depressed child because I had done something wrong and I was being punished by my stepfather [Paul Cremaschi]. And, any sane adult human who looks at that and says, "How can you twist a young child into somebody who would become depressed when it stops?" It's horrible (crying). Speaker 2: Did you find yourself angry with your mother [Ruby Page Schwimmer]? Speaker 1: Not until after she died. My mother was an amazing person. It's so funny, given what I've shared with you. It's gonna be hard to reconcile with that, with the fact that she was an educator. She was looking after everyone's children. She was the principal of many schools, and she made a very positive difference in not only the lives of the students who were there, but the teachers and the parents. She died at age sixty-seven, and at her funeral, over three hundred people came and spent hours telling my brother [Wayne St. John] and my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I what she had done for them. And how much she had done for them. That she had kept kids in school who, you know, gotten them off drugs and somebody said, "She helped me find a husband." You know, or parents, "She helped me get back in school." Or teachers, "She helped my further degree." And, you know, she did so much for so many people. But when you look back, she was a very, you know, her life, her childhood was so horrible, she was fighting with demons. When I was growing up, she used to take us to motivational speakers, she used to spend hours writing affirmations. Writing positive statements over and over again. So what I learned from her was that her life was messy and painful, but she fought to try to stay more positive. She didn't always win, but she fought for more positivity for herself, for her children, you know, even though, okay, she made this one really big mistake with marrying Paul Cremaschi, and not being able to see the signs. But she filled our house with books. She made us love education. She supported our interests, whether it was skiing or my brother's photography. He built a--he's a photographer now. He built, she bought him his first enlarger to develop pictures, at a pawn shop. You know, and helped him build a dark room in the garage, and she gave us so much. It's--at her funeral, my brother's speech, he said, "She was the best of moms, and she was the worst of moms. But she was never in between." So I valued my relationship with her. When she turned sixty, I took her to England for a week, we spent a week in England together. Shortly before she died, I got to speak on a Disney cruise [Disney Cruise Line] and I took her with her. She loved, me with her, she loved Disney [The Walt Disney Company], and Roy Disney [Roy E. Disney] was on the ship. And Jennifer Hudson was singing on the ship, and it was an amazing trip. I loved my mother and I wanted that relationship. But after she died, I think I was willing, I was willing to admit more things to myself. And it's like what I said about when my stepfather died. You're willing to go down roads that you didn't go down for many years. When my mother died, it felt like, you know if you took a beach ball, and you pushed it under the water, and then you took your hand away, it would shoot up? That's what it felt like to me, is that there was all this stuff that had been pushed down for so long, and it shot up after she died, and I couldn't stop it. So I was, I had a lot of anger after she died that I had to process. But I didn't share that with her.

And I was like--you know, I looked cute, you know, this is fun, and it's just an interesting analogy with what I was saying about my relationship with God. So I leaned, and then I said, "I don't want nothing. I can do this on my own. I'm gonna look cool. I'm gonna be cool. I'm gonna be like everybody else," you know. And when I had my daughter [Darcy Deane], and then the pain of the sexual abuse started coming up, I couldn't do it on my own anymore, and the pain was so intense. I was going through that process of going back over the memories, and doing the healing, and I was still a mom. And I would have to come back and be a mom, dry my tears, and come back and be a mom, or go and give a motivational speech for everybody. And because I had to hold it together for my daughter, sometimes when I would fly to another city to give a speech, that was when I could break down and cry, and just let the pain out. And I remember I was in a hotel room, and I was supposed to give a speech, and I was laying on the bed and just sobbing. And just--the pain was just coming over me so much, I couldn't get off the bed. I couldn't get up. And I remember, I just said, "Help me, God." And it was like it lifted and I could get off the bed. And that was a moment for me that I thought, this is real. This isn't talking to your invisible friend, God is real, and I want to know more about that. And so, having to go through that difficult healing process really brought me back to God and really helped me, inspired me to explore my relationship with prayer. And so it was because of that that I ended up writing the book, 'How Strong Women Pray' [Bonnie St. John]. Because I developed my prayer life, I'd started to get more of a relationship with God.

Speaker 1: Authoring books is part of the business that you created. Tell me about your business that--and when you started it, how it has developed? Speaker 2: So I left the White House [Washington, D.C.], and went home, and I got pregnant and had Darcy [Darcy Deane] and started a business. So I thought this was a good idea. To quit my job, get pregnant, and start a business, all at the same time. It was very difficult. It was kind of like that first week of skiing. It was very, very challenging. I was exhausted, I only had like twenty hours of babysitting, and was, you know, so starting a business was really slow. I quickly realized, most entrepreneurs were working sixty hours a week, you know. And I was working, maybe fifteen, you know, hours a week. And so things that would take an entrepreneur a week, it would take me a month. And so it was slow going, and it was exhausting, and I was a new mother, which we know is hard. Plus, I was starting to have a lot of the anxiety issues about the sexual abuse, and so it was hard getting started, but I wouldn't trade it for anything, because I was able, I had always--when I was in fourth grade, I was writing my first book ['Succeeding Sane: Making Room For Joy In A Crazy World,' Bonnie St. John]. I had always wanted to write books. And reading books had been my solace

And Darcy's father [Grant Deane] is a wonderful person, but in the end, we decided that it--we needed to get a divorce, and it was a very painful decision as it always is. But we worked through it we, we did a lot of therapy.

Speaker 1: The other part is this resilience. So that's sort of one piece that I really care about. But another piece is resilience as a whole. And so the next book that we have coming out is called 'Micro-Resilience' ['Micro-Resilience: Minor Shifts for Major Boosts in Focus, Drive, and Energy,' Bonnie St. John and Allen P. Haines]. And Allen [Allen P. Haines] is co-authoring it with me. He's actually gonna get his name on the cover this time. Not just to do all the work, but actually get his name on the cover. And it's taking many of the things I learned, coping with healing from sexual abuse, staying motivated, being an athlete. There's a lot of science, there's a lot of things that I read along the way about that. We went back and scoured the literature, the current literature, and found even more things. And micro-resilience is a set of tools. There is five frameworks and twenty-one tools that give you minor shifts you can make in your life each day that give you big boosts in energy and focus, and drive. So it's, this is the culmination of my work in many ways. Is to take the things I've learned, turn it into easy tools, and give it to people so that everybody can have more resilience.

Speaker 2: Hm, the highlight. Okay, I gotta think about this for a minute. So I've been in Ohio for ten years; came in 2003 as I mentioned, left the Beacon [Akron Beacon Journal] December 31st, 2006 and started at The Plain Dealer in 2007. I guess there have been a number of highlights; probably most significant is that a couple of years ago, the structure of county government in Cuyahoga County [Ohio] was changed, driven largely by the investigative reporting of The Plain Dealer, which unveiled widespread corruption. So being able to shed light on how the government has run, and to provide citizens with the kinds of information that would help them make a meaningful choice about doing things differently is probably the defining professional moment of my Cleveland experience. You know, there are a number of people--readers who would argue that The Plain Dealer should have been writing these stories twenty years ago, so as--one who wasn't here twenty years ago, can't really take the hit for what didn't happen. I don't necessarily disagree with, with some of those points but, you know, I think if you look at the work that we did in 2008 and 2009, that--not, not just one or two people of questionable character, but that really sort of unveiled a whole infrastructure of corruption and cronyism, and to get that broken down and to come up with a new structure that has, you know, leadership, you know, for the people by the people, where everyone has a seat at the table, really is significant. Speaker 1: Okay. So 2010, I guess, was a landmark year for those investigations? Speaker 2: Yes. That's when the sort of chickens came home to roost so to speak (laughter). Speaker 1: Yeah, I heard--well, this morning, [HistoryMaker] Harry Boomer again; he was saying another, you know, corruption scandal (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right. Speaker 1: --and he was talking about some other layer has been peeled back. Speaker 2: I mean that's the thing. What we really helped to do is unveil this whole culture of corruption and, you know, what has sprung from that is a whole series of investigations and a whole series of, you know, identifying pockets of mismanagement and misbehavior, and so, you know, when you think about journalism as a public trust, I mean I think that we most effectively fulfilled that role in the kinds of content that we're talking about here; but we're also doing it now around rape. As you know, 2013 was the year that three women [Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight] were found, you know, to have been locked in a house for a decade. Well, for the last three years, we have been pushing the state to do a better job of examining rape kits and, you know, I think our content, as well as, you know, other developments, have sort of moved the state to a place where it's more effectively and efficiently testing rape kits, and thousands of rapes are being resolved as a result of much of the work that we're doing. And so, you know, we are continuing to push to--particularly, you know, for poor women whose credibility is questionable, they've never--you know, they rarely have been able to get anybody to listen to their cries. And now the state attorney general [Mike DeWine] has made a commitment to testing every untested rape kit that's out there, and there are about four thousand, and they're about a third of the way through. And in some cases, the offenders are in custody; you know, they're right there but no one's ever tested and no one's ever asked, and so for many families, including families who've had people not just rape but murder, some of those murders have been resolved in the past year. In one case, a woman's daughter was killed thirty years ago and just gotten to a place where she knows what happened. But as it relates to the rape kits specifically, there's a twenty year statute of limitations, and so there's this race to get those tested before that statute runs out. Story_ID: 653800 Speaker 1: One of the reasons the whole discussion of the rape kits is important is, if you recall, in 2008, the bodies of eleven dead women were found either in the house or in the yard of a serial killer in Cleveland [Ohio]; his name was Anthony Sowell-- Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous). Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so if you look on our front page the day that Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was elected, when you get to the second front page [of The Plain Dealer], you see the developments around the Anthony Sowell murders. And so we had Anthony Sowell and, you know, that's discovered in 2008, and then in (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is an African American man-- Speaker 1: African American man-- Speaker 2: --living in--on the-- Speaker 1: --living on the east side of Cleveland who, you know, murdered women who were, you know, largely drug addicts who didn't necessarily have a lot of credibility with law enforcement. Since that time, other women have come forward to say, "Yes, I reported being raped by him and the police didn't do anything." So that really was the catalyst for this work. And then when you fast forward to 2013 and you see the Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight developments, it just makes the case for why this work is so critically important. So we're--you know, if we have to look at what was our signature content in 2013, in addition to covering the live story of the escape of these women who lived this decade of captivity, it's really the impact of our journalism on the potential to reduce this fr
m continuing to happen; so, you know, we think that's, we think that's important. Even as we change the way that we're distributing content, we think that deep investigative commitment is our competitive advantage--it's what we can do that nobody else can do in this town.

 SARAH CATHERINE BRYAN: All right. Hello. It is July 26th, 2013 at one in the afternoon. I am Sarah Catherine Bryan interviewing Margaret Barrett at the Orange County Rape Crisis Center. So to begin with, would you like to share anything about where you come from, who you are, your childhood? MARGARET BARRETT: Sure. I&#8217;m Margaret Barrett and I grew up in Buies Creek, North Carolina, a small town where Campbell University is based there, and much of my family still lives in the Harnett County area. So I ended up coming to UNC Chapel Hill for my undergraduate, and, like a lot of people, ended up sticking around for a while at UNC. When I was at UNC, I did a lot with women&#8217;s issues. I took a lot of women&#8217;s studies classes, and I was involved a little bit in the campus Y women&#8217;s forum. I got to do an internship in the Department of Women&#8217;s Studies. That was before you had women studies as a major although I think a friend of mine was the first women&#8217;s studies major about a year after I graduated. So I was a political science major. And after graduation, I took a year to explore different options, and during that year I had a really great experience. I went through the volunteer training and I became a Helpline volunteer. And Helpline in those days in about 1987 Helpline was through the Orange-Person-Chatham Mental Health Center, and it was a suicide prevention hotline, but it also addressed many, many other issues. And so the training was really great and lots of role plays, lots of getting to talk to clients or getting practice before talking to clients. And I became very immersed in doing this Helpline crisis intervention. One of the jobs of Helpline volunteers was we served as the first response crisis contact for the Orange County Rape Crisis Center. And for what then was the Orange-Durham Coalition for Battered Women. And so I think of that as my first introduction to the rape crisis center. I&#8217;m sure I knew about it in various ways when I was an undergraduate student. But that was my first time contributing somehow to the mission of the center. And it was also my introduction to crisis intervention as something that I really liked being involved in. So after a bit of time being a Helpline volunteer, I ended up going to law school, and I kept doing that volunteer work, and I had been doing it long enough at that point that they invited me to be one of the trainers for the volunteer classes. It was still a volunteer position but I felt like I was more part of that work. So that was my introduction to actually participating in the kind of really excellent volunteer training that I think Orange County Rape Crisis Center still does. And so I also got to meet the--, I think it was usually the director at the time, Mary Ann Chap who would come in and do the training for the Helpline volunteers. So I went to law school, was very active in Women in Law, [which] was the name of the group. In law school I did some--, worked for some law firms, did some criminal law practice during law school. But really my passion continued to be with women&#8217;s issues or what then were labeled more as women&#8217;s issues. And I ended up taking a job in Charlottesville, Virginia doing mostly family law research and writing. I really liked writing and that seemed like a good fit. So I was a research attorney, there for two years, doing things like child custody jurisdiction, and I definitely was drawn back, wanted to get back to the Chapel Hill community even though Charlottesville was nice. While I was in Charlottesville, I did some volunteer work with literacy, the local literacy council. But I really missed the community in the Chapel Hill, Orange County, and Durham County area. And so I got married to my husband, Craig Carlson, and we came back to Chapel Hill, and I came back to a job as Assistant Dean of Students and Judicial Programs Officer at UNC Chapel Hill, which was really a huge dream job for me. And part of my job there was going to be training student leaders around how to handle hearings, disciplinary hearings and those kinds of things. Part of it was sexual assault issues and helping to do compassionate appropriate response to students who were survivors of sexual violence and also helping to draft and administer policies around sexual violence. So there had been a lot of controversy on campus around sexual violence at that time or soon before I started. So the issues for the Committee on Student Conduct and some other initiatives that I was involved in really did focus a lot on sexual violence, and in that role within my first year I had been to the Orange County Rape Crisis Center several times because I really wanted to build that relationship with the university. So I would go to the Rape Crisis Center and participate in the volunteer trainings and talk about the university&#8217;s response, help prepare the rape crisis companions, how, what they might expect if they were helping a survivor through the university discipline processes or other ways the university could support survivors. And that was a really important part of my job. I also was one of the people at UNC that would greet survivors of sexual assault and help them determine what their options were and--. So then seven years into that I was Associate Dean of Students and Judicial Officer. And I had a chance, the Dean of Students had retired, and I had a chance to partially fill in that role for about a year, a year and a half, and I reached a point where I thought I was ready to transition into something different. I had been on one or two non-profit boards and I decided that I was going to consider non-profit management, and I started telling my friends, &#8220;Oh I would really like to work somewhere in non-profit management, maybe somewhere like the Orange County Rape Crisis Center.&#8221; So I started quietly telling friends that, just for more of a long-term plan. I wasn&#8217;t thinking of it as short term. I remember telling one of my best friends, &#8220;oh and I&#8217;m going to talk to Margaret Henderson who&#8217;s the director of Rape Crisis Center and see if I could ever maybe shadow her sometime and see what she does or maybe do even an internship there or something.&#8221; And lo and behold, about a week after I start saying all this Margaret Henderson announced she was leaving. And I saw it literally in the paper, which was really strange. And I thought, &#8220;Oh no, now this is something I have to think about and consider a little bit more quickly because obviously I had been very drawn to the work and to the organization and to non-profit work.&#8221; And then all of a sudden there&#8217;s that opportunity there that I really was not--, not necessarily prepared for all aspects of it. I had not had a lot of fundraising or development experience. I had not had huge amounts of financial management experience. But I had been immersed in the issues around sexual violence, and I had done a lot of volunteer training and a lot of work with clients and survivors of sexual violence, and I knew the community and I was part of the system that cared for sexual violence survivors. So there was a big piece of it that I felt real confident about and then there was a big piece of it that I was less certain. And I remember they had a really intense interview process. I had to come and meet with three different groups during that summer, and I remember how supportive Margaret Henderson was when I told her that I was applying, and I&#8217;m sure she was probably supportive to everyone who was involved in it if there were other candidates. So after the intensive interview process where I had to write an essay or something--I think the essay was to tell people why I was interested in the job--I ended up getting the job. So that was how my career at the Orange County Rape Crisis Center began. I started in September of 1999 after being at the university from [19]93 to [19]99. I started at OCRCC around September of [19]99 and came in with an incredible staff. I can remember all the staff members who are very dear to my heart. When I started Amanda O&#8217;Briant was the crisis response coordinator. Caroline Biber was Community Education coordinator. Matt Ezzell was the administrative services coordinator. You&#8217;ve met Matt? SB: Yes. Yes. Sorry. MB: That&#8217;s okay. That&#8217;s the reaction you often get when you mention Matt&#8217;s name. Let&#8217;s think for a second. Melany Coopmans was the Support Services Coordinator. We had Lisa Weisemann-Ward as a part-time community education assistant. And I&#8217;m trying to think. Oh, and Christina Riordan was the Northern Orange services coordinator. So we had just kind of newly had our office in northern Orange County. And I hope I&#8217;m not forgetting anyone. But I could easily be. We had about six or seven staff at that time. So it was a pretty small group, and they did amazing work. It was definitely when I started the job, they were at a point where volunteer involvement had been declining in terms of how many hours were donated by volunteers and that was a huge challenge because it slipped up on us. I remember Margaret Henderson thought it was because the economy was better so more people were working part-time or getting jobs instead of necessarily spending those hours volunteering. When volunteers couldn&#8217;t fill a twenty-four hour shift or do a community education program the staff members really had to fill in those gaps. So that was really pretty daunting. I remember Amanda and Caroline were working lots of extra hours because they were doing the volunteer trainings and filling all those gaps. So I remember one of the things that I had to do early on was [to] sit down with everybody and look at [the] workload, not the most glamorous of issues. Just looking at how we can balance this workload because thanks to Margaret Henderson&#8217;s great leadership I had inherited sort of the culture of self-care. That was not something people talked about at the university, a culture of self-care. It was more work all the time and that&#8217;s okay. At the Rape Crisis Center it was this idea that you need to take care of yourself in order to be healthy to help care for survivors or the community. So we really tried to work on that. I&#8217;ve talked for too long. SB: No, you&#8217;ve given me some really great material. But especially at the university where you were, you were performing the jobs of what now are fulfilled by Title IX coordinator and the Title IX--, I know him as E.W.--, but you were filling so many roles for what is now four or five positions at the university. What was it like for six years with no community of self-care to or very little? MB: I should say that I, we had an incredible Dean of Students Fred Schroeder, and then Melissa Exum for my last year was the Dean of Students. Then there were always other Assistant Deans of Students. There was Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and Ron Binder did Greek Affairs and Judy Barter before Ron Binder, so there were a lot of people in the Dean of Students office. There was also a Sexual Harassment officer who did more of that Title IX because that was more the staff and faculty. So we networked a lot with that office.

Now that doesn&#8217;t mean that we had everything solved, and there were lots of bumpy issues around sexual assault when I was at the university where we were starting [to] doing more training and things like that. And the Rape Crisis Center had been pushing for us to do a better job. By the time I got to UNC they were already pushing for that. That would be interesting research to look back at some of the cases, some of the around 1992, [19]93 you&#8217;d find some interesting news articles. SB: Yeah. Right when the student governments started adjudicating cases under the honor system of sexual assault. MB: Yeah, I don&#8217;t know how far that went back, but yeah it probably went back to the late [19]80s, early [19]90s. SB: You mentioned that there&#8217;d been some controversy around sexual violence on campus at the time you came to UNC. Would you talk about that a little? MB: It was primarily around how cases were handled by the student judicial system. So it&#8217;s much like some of the dialogue going on now and my memory, I have to be cautious because I don&#8217;t want to share things that would&#8217;ve been confidential obviously. That many years ago it&#8217;s hard maybe to separate, but there definitely was some public controversy because the Committee on Student Conduct was considering all the policies based on input they had gotten from the Rape Crisis Center as well as from some student groups like the Rape Action Project and the, what was the organization called? It might have been called Women Against Rape. WAR&#8212; SB: WAR, yeah. MB: But I can&#8217;t remember. As [it] happens now a few student groups changed their names so it would be one acronym. It was ASAP for a while, Advocates of Students Against--, Advocates for Sexual Assault Prevention. That&#8217;s what it was. ASAP. SB: The Feminist Students United is the direct--, there&#8217;s a direct lineage from ASAP to the group. MB: And ASAP might have been the WAR first and the Rape Action Project. So all that was swirling around when I came to UNC, which ultimately helped. Over my years, the seven years I was at UNC I was not always the direct sexual assault person. There were other people in our office, mainly Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and later Don Appiairus because I was the Judicial Officer. So I tended to do a lot of sexual assault to help train about what it was like to go through the student judicial system. And because we would have gaps in coverage somebody would leave, and then it would take a while to replace, I was the direct person a lot of times, for sometimes as much as a year at a time. But I wasn&#8217;t always that direct person and so that was always something that stayed with me that that was an interest I was, I wanted to do more on, which was a big part of what led me to the Rape Crisis Center, bringing it back to OCRCC. And actually when I got to the Rape Crisis Center I do think it was good that I had those university relationships but probably for a good while I needed to focus more on building those community relationships. I look back and it&#8217;s hard to remember exactly, but I probably did less with the university but more encouraged other staff to partner with the university so that I could focus on building relationships with the County, with the Town of Chapel Hill, Hillsborough, Carrboro, and with other donors like the United Way. I remember spending a lot of time my first couple years with United Way because they were restructuring and you had to be part of several committees with United Way. We got some funding through a children and youth committee and some funding through what I think was a self-sufficiency committee for our client work. So it was interesting. I came from the university background, but I didn&#8217;t do as much with that once I was over with Rape Crisis because the County is such a huge entity. It was surprising to me because I having been on campus for a long time and then you think of the campus as such a big part, but then when you are in a position when you are serving the whole county you realize how much broader it is. SB: It&#8217;s part of the bubble effect where it&#8217;s not so much--, well it is in part the fact the self-importance that comes with being part of a university campus, but also the fact that it functions as a town within a town within a county. I&#8217;ve done a series of interviews and people have talked about the longer temporal scope of Orange County, OCRCC&#8217;s vision for providing services at the universities. Because of turnover and the lack of stability because there&#8217;s not an institutional knowledge of how to adjudicate the cases fairly, how to relate to people who are going through the process. Since you brought a strong, feminist and survivor friendly perspective to your job were, as the associate dean, did you encounter much pushback or surprise from people regarding your perspectives? MB: I don&#8217;t think so. I mean I came in to--, because I was committed to being the Judicial Officer. That was my primary scope of work. I definitely came in to be -- neutral is the wrong word--, but objective. One of the things that brought me to Rape Crisis was the desire to be more of an advocate. When you&#8217;re a Judicial Officer, you can&#8217;t be an advocate. You have to be really balanced and you can support students who are in front of you and you can help them know what their resources are and where they can go, but you have to really balance that, if you&#8217;re the Judicial Officer, you have to see the whole picture and make sure everybody&#8217;s getting fair judgment. Honestly, wanting to be more overtly, do more overt advocacy was part of what drew me to the Rape Crisis Center. Because you&#8217;re always in different roles. SB: Interesting. It&#8217;s knowing the whole picture, coming to the Rape Crisis Center but you had to know what it was like to be a respond
ng party within the system. That sounds like a really valuable set of experiences. MB: Yeah, I mean it was different. For me it was nice to have more focus on one issue. Sexual violence is obviously broader than one issue. So it&#8217;s very broad. But coming from UNC I was dealing with academic dishonesty; I was dealing with substance abuse issues, alcohol, sexual violence, student crises, suicide prevention, all of this wide range of issues. And so it was freeing to come and focus more directly on one issue that&#8217;s really important and that intersects with so many other issues in a lot of ways. And that&#8217;s one of the things I love about the Rape Crisis Center is that it stayed true to its mission and a really focused mission, and sometimes there&#8217;s temptations to bring issues together which you do to solve problems, but I think sexual violence especially lends itself to getting submerged if you don&#8217;t have something that focuses directly on it. So I&#8217;ve been really proud that the Rape Crisis Center has continued to have rape in the name for example. And that was a debate that every once in a while would come up in my years. I think it always does. &#8220;Oh, should we consider changing the name? Should we make it broader?&#8221; And ultimately folks would always go back to the sign on Estes Drive. We were the little house on Estes Drive my whole time there, which is exciting to be here in this nice space on Franklin Street. I still am just amazed when I come in here. And I thought the space on Estes Drive was really nice because the Center had been, I don&#8217;t know if Margaret Henderson talked to you about that. But they had been in this little old rickety house on Rosemary Street. And so getting the space on Estes Drive was a big deal when Margaret Henderson was there. I had visited there and gone to training. So keeps moving into cleaner, nicer spaces that is good, giving people more of a feeling of self-care, protection, whatever. SB: That just being invited into spaces. I know that in the Estes Drive house there was a workshop where a community advocate came in it [and] was like, &#8220;Where are the gender non-specific bathrooms?&#8221;, which I really appreciate, understanding although we&#8217;re all focused on eliminating rape that there are ways where we can foreground sexual violence while addressing racial oppression, gender oppression, heterosexism. MB: Well I don&#8217;t remember. We only had one working bathroom there. So I guess everything was gender non-specific. SB: Gender non-specific. MB: In the Estes Drive space. SB: Estes Drive, then it must be Rosemary Street. I feel like this person came within this millennium. MB: I don&#8217;t know. I only remember one. We had one little bathroom that was in one of the offices, but it usually didn&#8217;t work and was storage. But the folks at Amity Methodist Church by and large were very nice about fixing things up. They were our landlords. The church next door was the landlord. And you&#8217;re talking, speaking about the oppression issues and the intersection between sexual violence. Really neat historically. Michelle Johnson-- You know Michelle. SB: Yes. MB: She is now a Carrboro Board of Alderman. And Michelle was a volunteer at the Rape Crisis Center and eventually was on the Board and was on the staff for a while and she was very instrumental. I learned a great deal from her. She had given me some input, and she really helped us start a Diversity Committee and to think intentionally about how sexual violence intersects with other forms of oppression. Then when we did strategic planning probably either midway or a little more than that when I was at the Rape Crisis Center, we did a big strategic planning process. We ended up with a vision. I was sharing it last week because I was doing a training about a form of strategic planning and facilitating the meeting and I said oh when I was at the Rape Crisis Center our vision was a world free of sexual violence and all other forms of oppression. That may still be the vision. I haven&#8217;t looked at it lately but very ambitious. And then we tried to focus in our mission on stopping sexual violence and its impact through support, education and advocacy. Thanks to the incredible volunteers like Michelle and Linda Brooks and some other folks, really we did try to focus on diversity in a really intentional way, not just one aspect but lots of different aspects. And we focused a lot on disability issues, we were very fortunate, there was a project going on with the state Office of Health and Disability, and they contacted us and said, we would like to provide you all with funding and support to improve your services for survivors of sexual assault with disabilities. And so they came in and did an assessment for us and helped implement a lot of things. Everything from a disability parking space to Braille on the door to helping us look at how our documents wouldn&#8217;t be accessible to people with learning disabilities, all sorts of stuff. And they did trainings for our volunteers. I actually remember they did a day-long training on a Saturday. And that turned out to be the Saturday that I had my son who&#8217;s now nine years old. So I had to miss the disability training. I called during the training and I remember Kiran Easwara Chandran, who was our Client Services Director at the time answered, and they were doing activities to help the staff and volunteers learn how to better serve clients with disabilities. She was all excited that my baby had been born. SB: You called after you&#8217;d given labor, gone through labor? MB: Well, I mean for me and maybe not for everybody, the Rape Crisis Center when I was working here it really was a family to me. It was, as you can imagine, pretty intense to work in sexual violence. You may work in it yourself. But it&#8217;s very intense and to do it you develop a lot of camaraderie and really love and support for the folks you work with. So it seemed normal. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t normal. But a Rape Crisis Center is not just your garden variety workplace. SB: In order to not have people dropping out every few years, which still happens for a number of great reasons you need to have strong, something other than a passion for ending rape because&#8212;. MB: Yeah, you need a lot of support and, but I do think that that&#8217;s part of what makes it hard to stay in for a long, long time. I mean eight years definitely seemed like a long time. It is that intensity of, intensity of the issue, intensity of the work, intensity of keeping a small nonprofit afloat. So kudos to Shamecca and everybody for keeping it going. SB: Forty years, almost. It&#8217;s amazing because I developed relationships or been friends with people who do this sort of work and this is a twenty year old but only have relationships with people who have done this, this kind of work. Was it strange going out of rape crisis work or--? MB: Oh definitely. SB: Yeah. MB: Definitely. Because, even now it feels strange sometimes during holidays and things where I&#8217;m not thinking about who might have the pager or should I have the pager or I&#8217;m not on&#8212;I&#8217;m not thinking about who&#8217;s on call. But that is a big deal. When you&#8217;re working in Rape Crisis Center, you&#8217;re always aware that somebody is on call. I ran into last week because we have kids at the same school, a man who was a detective. And he doesn&#8217;t work in that field anymore either, but he was a detective who investigated sexual assault cases and we were reminiscing about being at the hospital in the middle of the night and never sure what the call was going to be and those kinds of things and so it does. It feels --I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a certain amount of -- well there&#8217;s really a great appreciation for those who are doing it. I don&#8217;t want to say there&#8217;s guilt that you&#8217;re not doing it, because that&#8217;s not a good healthy thing. But that happens maybe the first year or so, and then later it&#8217;s more this appreciation for the people who are doing it. And occasionally when my kids are a little older, I wouldn&#8217;t mind going back to doing some crisis intervention volunteer work because there&#8217;s something about being with somebody in that time of crisis. I was talking recently with Ardith Burkes who was our Crisis Response Coordinator for three years and now she works at the Compass Center doing client services for the Compass Center. And we were sharing that feeling of how being there when somebody is going through such a difficult crisis and being able to help them through it and to know that they can get, that healing is a process not something quick. But you&#8217;re helping them move toward healing, and there&#8217;s really nothing, you feel like that&#8217;s where you really needed to be when you&#8217;re in that moment with people. SB: Thank you for sharing that. So the first year it&#8217;s would you say that you, I don&#8217;t know how to say this or what I&#8217;m saying right now. MB: The first year I came to the Rape Crisis Center? SB: Or the first year after leaving, where did you feel there was a change in the degree of support you had from the people with whom you did work or--?. MB: No, it was so different because I was going into a job that was more of a writing job, and I was, because my kids were three and five at the time and sleep had not really come easily for a few years, I was really tired, honestly. I was so tired. The transition was right into this job that was more of a writing and editing job and learning that. So it was a good transition. I&#8217;ve continued trying to financially support the center whenever I can and however much I can so I&#8217;ve stayed at least somewhat aware. But it is, there&#8217;s a lot that goes on. I don&#8217;t know if I answered what you were asking. SB: Is there anything that you expected me to ask during this that I didn&#8217;t? MB: I don&#8217;t think so. I mean I do want to say that I was so fortunate to have really strong Board of Directors&#8217; leadership when I started. Brendan Moylan was the Board President. So he was the Board President who made the offer to me to come and work. And then Mary Cason was the next Board President or she was the vice president with Brendan, and Brendan is an incredible leader and so is Mary. And Mary and I have become close friends. I consider her one of my best friends ever in the world. In fact, we&#8217;re going out to dinner tomorrow night. And Mary was the Board President. She was a volunteer companion, a community educator. She was, she went to, Mary and I had the distinct experience of going to court at one time to try to keep Rape Crisis Center records private. So that felt like a historical moment. So I joke sometimes when people, people wonder if I can keep something confidential. And I&#8217;ll say sometimes well, I went to court before to protect confidentiality. You can trust me. I&#8217;m not going to spill your secrets. So that was a big thing where we had been served with a subpoena to release some client records and there&#8217;s a lot of media, and there was a lot of media coverage around that. Bob Epting, who is this fantastic local attorney who is also a pilot and flies small planes ( ). Bob came and represented us for free as we didn&#8217;t think we should have to release records. So that was an important moment and we got recognized for that work by the NC Center for Nonprofits. Somewhere around here there&#8217;s a little award from that. So that was good. That felt like we were doing something for other Rape Crisis Centers as well. We also had other board presidents like Shauna Hay and Shelley Golden and Elin Abercrombie and Amy Preble, just really great folks. Most of our board presidents while I was at the Rape Crisis Center came from the pool of volunteers. They had been trained in being a rape crisis companion or being a Community Educator and came at it with that strong training and then rose into being a leader, being a Board President type of leader. That was really important that folks have that grounding. One thing that really stayed strong and still is that commitment to strong training which is expensive if you think about it. It&#8217;s really hard to do forty to sixty hours of training, and it&#8217;s hard for people to devote that time. So that was a real commitment the agency had. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve tried to stay as close to that as they can. But it got harder and harder because there were a lot of organizations you could volunteer for without having that much training. So how are we on time? SB: One-fifty-seven. MB: Yeah, I need to go soon. SB: All right. Well, unless there are other comments you&#8217;d like to add, I&#8217;ve been thrilled to have this conversation with you actually. But-- MB: Well, great if you have other questions at some point let me know and you&#8217;re going use this to fold into the overall oral history? Is that the way it gets used? SB: Yes, this will probably go into the Long Women&#8217;s Movement Collection, but once we stop recording I can go over the deed of gift forms and-- MB: That&#8217;s probably a good idea because I have a two-thirty...

 Yes, this is a triptych about addiction. This first one is really about everything that goes with it as far as living in an alcoholic family, the consequences of it, and some of the things that because children end up raising other children. You could even say, maybe teen pregnancy, but a lot of it has to do with how we treat each other even when you re in that. The consequences of it, like I said. The acting out, and the high risk, and the rage. Then, of course, broken promises, good intentions, but broken promises. This COA stands for Children of Alcoholics, and on the can it says DUI. It s a multigenerational thing. That s why planting seeds is on there because if people grow up in this environment they re more likely to, unfortunately, become the same way. They hear all this stuff growing up, I hate you. You can t do anything right. You re stupid. You re not good enough. Those are just, don t cry, standard things, so it s a lot of feelings in there. (Laughs) Little Thunder Okay. This is the second part of the triptych. 29 Henderson This is the second part of the triptych. You can see that they go together as far as flowing into, one to another. Like I was saying a while ago, as a result of all of this, a lot of times this is what you get from it. This represents the internalizing all of these things and the consequences of that. All of these things that are written into the figure is what s internalized and what people think about themselves if they grew up in this environment. A lot of times children of alcoholics, they have shame, they feel like they re no good. Even if they ve been told, You re a great person, or whatever and, You re doing wonderful things, nothing s ever good enough. They re very angry. Some of this other stuff is what people say, I m worried about you. They re just kind of standard things that come with it. Resentment. Why did this happen to me? Sometimes there will be sexual assault. They ll grow up with all sorts of emotional issues from that kind of trauma. The black part is very important because people that are in that depression, that s what they say, all of them say it, All I could see was black. That s all I can see. This part right here represents, the little white and yellow, is kind of like a light at the end of the tunnel. They ll describe that, too. They ll say, I can see a little bit of a light, but they don t really want to believe it, and they can t believe it because it has to do with the fear, and the anger, and not thinking they can 30 do anything about it. So a lot of them do suicide. They disintegrate, they develop depression, and they isolate, so that s why we ve got this person sitting up here, isolated. Little Thunder I can see why students would relate so strongly to this, too. All right, and this is the last one of the triptych. Henderson Yes, so you can see how it also flows into the other one, the last one. What the last one represents is recovery basically surviving. If a person makes it through all of this, and they live and they don t commit suicide and they actually get some help, and work through those things this is what can happen. These are some of the promises and some of the support and things that happen. That you re not alone because you really feel like you are. What you realize when you get that support is that you re not alone. They teach you how to be grateful, that s part of the changing in the thinking. Because you know you can think of the glass half empty, or half full. So they teach you about and part of that is about gratitude. The easiest way to get to a positive thought is through gratitude and you got to think about it because sometimes we like to dwell in our feeling sorry for ourselves. That s also where the healing starts, and being able to celebrate, and feeling blessed where the miracles start to happen. The hand goes through from the person and it s holding like a little lamp, so that s like the symbol of hope, and the butterfly for renewal.

Speaker 2: So my mother is Diana Gray, and she was born in San Francisco, California in 1943. She didn't grow up in California. She grew up in Spokane, Washington, and the sort of important things to know about my mother's people are that my mother's people are Mormon and, in fact, her, I guess her great, her grandparents, came as English immigrants, following the Mormon prophet, who'd come to them and who had spoken to them about being Latter-day Saints. They actually became part of that movement of Latter-day Saints who pushed hand carts across the American West when they were ejected, because of the, the stereotyping and the repression against Mormons and against their freedom of religion at that period. They pushed hand carts across the American West, you know Latter-day Saints, one of the things we do is we keep really good records so we know the whole story of that movement, and then my mother's mother, Anne [ph.], was born in California as part of that movement. Her first few children were born in California, but she raised them in Spokane, Washington. So, my mother is the fourth of five children in what was a family that was very observant to Latter-day Saints, although maybe not so much my grandfather. He was mostly just religious about his golf. She went off to Brigham Young University [Provo, Utah]. In 1964, she graduated, having written newspaper articles about Mormon womanhood, ran off to Las Vegas [Nevada] with her boyfriend at the time, (whispers) had sex--one night and so woke up and got married the next morning in Las Vegas in an orange mohair dress at the Hitching Post Chapel (laughter) and that was my sister's father, so she married him, she lived, had my sister [Elizabeth], lived for a few years, and then suffered through first the divorce with him, and then eventually from his suicide after they divorced, found herself a single parent with really no place in the church that had such traditional roles for women and so she went through the highly radicalizing experience of going to graduate school, went to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] in sociology, studied criminology, but especially women in the criminal justice system, wrote a master's thesis about women's sex workers and the experience that these women were having and the ways in which they were being exploited and also girls and women in the criminal justice system and the ways in which they were being often incarcerated for what were called "status offenses." So, a girl would be raped by her stepfather and she would run away because she had been sexually assaulted and then she would be put into juvenile detention because of a status offense of being a runaway. In the process of that experience, my mother was a graduate student who was teaching a statistics course, and that is where she met my very loud-mouthed father [William M. Harris, Sr.] , so it's kind of a quirky story, because if you met my mom today, social justice advocate, you know, white woman who raised an African American child who, you know, has lived in my household since my now almost thirteen-year-old was born and helped raise, you know, African American grandchildren, who has lived in New Orleans [Louisiana], in Chicago [Illinois] and New Jersey, who is quite cosmopolitan in her role view and progressive, it would be hard to imagine that she is the 1964 Mormon womanhood, you know, Brigham Young University graduate, but she is all of those things. And so, my mom was both the most traditional, sweet honest little-old white lady you'll ever meet and also this kind of, you know, woman who was part of an underground network to make sure women could access abortions before Roe v. Wade. She is an extraordinary woman and has really impacted who I am.

Speaker 1: When you describe your evolving ideo--thinking. You mention [HM] Maulana Karenga who, at that time, was huge. Kwanzaa was very, very big. Can you describe your evolution in concept from Nia and in alignment with Karenga, too, your thinking when you got to "Barbershop, Bibles, and BET?" Speaker 2: So, I was in college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and doing all this activism, and, or what I understand to be activism, campus protests, you know, kind of campus as a laboratory, all of that is around race. We are identified, in fact, we threw campus Kwanzaa every year, we saw ourselves as bringing racial presence to the campus. I did, I did almost nothing with women's organizing on campus. Now, I took women's studies classes, I read bell hooks, but I, in my actual work I did almost nothing around womens'--unless it was black womens--work with an emphasis, probably, on the racial aspect of it. It was really in graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina] when I started to identify with two important things; one, that I was a rape survivor which, although it occurred before I ever even left to go to college, I'm really rare--I don't know that I ever really talked about it in college. I certainly hadn't even disclosed it to my own parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] until senior year, maybe even, either senior year of college or first year of graduate school before I even disclosed that it had happened, even though it happened when I was fourteen. I just did not talk about it with any--when I was 14, I told one person, a friend, and no one else until I was about 20. And so, as I started engaging both my own kind of personal healing around it, started to disclose it, started to think of it as part of my identity as being a sexual assault survivor, that draws you into doing women's work in a different way and I also started reading a lot of work by African American women who were rape survivors and, of course, almost all of us are survivors of rape at the hands of men who are black, because everyone is most likely to be sexually assaulted within the context of their own race. It's not that men are most, that black men are most likely to be rapists, but they are most likely to be the rapists of black women, just as white men are most likely to be the rapists of white women. The--"We must save the endangered black man, we must rally all together, our unity is more important than anything else"--starts to fall apart when you are willing to be very honest about the amount of intra-racial gender violence, and it was something that even though I had experienced it, I just hadn't dealt with it or thought about it, or theorized about it, or put it in the context of my work, and once I started doing that, it forced me to say, "Okay, how do I love the race? How do I talk about this notion of black masculinity and black manhood, but have a place to talk about what happened to me at the hands of a black man." And, the more that I did that and the more that I started, you know, you start just following, I try to get my students to read this way--you read one thing and that person mentions something and then you can read that person since you are kind of, you know, doing this intellectual history just through reading what the people that you're reading are reading--and when I started to
do that, all of a sudden I realized, Oh, my God! Every time people would say, I could remember conversations in college where we would say how bad slavery was, in part because black women were raped, and if black women were raped that meant black men could not protect their women. I could remember these conversations as though the main victim of rape is the man, whose manhood is somehow damaged by this. I can remember us saying in Kwanzaa, like, "We must protect the black woman who is our community's greatest resource." Ahhh--she is the community, like, push her over as the resource in part, because black sororities and fraternities come out of an era of uplift. There is also a lot of weird, like gendered stuff that goes on about being "the backbone," so even though Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] is this black woman's organization, also sometimes reproduces a respectability politics that still has a relatively constrained notion for who black women are, and so you learn those things as mantras that you repeat because you're proud of the organization, and it wasn't until I start reading some of the critiques that I was like, "Oh, yeah, woah. That is a problem." So it really, it was this kind of personal moment of changing my identity from, like pan-Africanist, nationalist, black girl, to pan-African nationalist black girl rape survivor, to "Oh-wait a minute, that is going to have to change my whole analysis," and so by the time, and, I'm also by the way encountered Wahneema Lubiano, who made me read a whole bunch of other things and also just made me stop saying certain kinds of things and I met my very best girlfriend [Blair Kelley], who is the second half of my brain and she has never been anybody's nationalist nothing, and so she critiqued and she challenged. She is a historian, actually a dean at North Carolina State [University in Raleigh, North Carolina] right now, so, as a historian she would push back against some of the kind of ahistorical, racial things I would say and so some of it was my identity, some of it was my friendship, some of it was what I was reading, but, you know, by the time five years of graduate school passed, I had a very, very different world view. Story_ID: 564909 Speaker 1: So I want to go back, you mention that you are a rape survivor and you didn't tell your parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] for a long time. Speaker 2: I don't, still never told my father. I mean, he watches the show so I guess he knows, but I never said it to my father, yeah. Speaker 1: Did your family know this person? Speaker 2: He was our neighbor, which is why I did not tell, so this was after we had moved and my mother had gone through a lot to buy the home, so this is the first time we lived in a single family home. It was the first home that she herself had purchased and bought, and the fact we built it. Not a fancy house, just very basic, but it was the home that she built. A nice little, you know, neighborhood, still two, my two best friends in high school [Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia] lived in that same neighborhood. This man, his backyard, so we were a corner lot, his backyard abutted ours, and he was a father, African American man, married, was a father of two children and lived there all through my high school, (not my, he wasn't there in high school) high school years, college years. I finally told, I might be getting this timing a little wrong, I think I told junior or senior year of college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. I told my mom and then, and it was because she kept bugging me. Some mail for him had come to our house and she kept asking me, I was home on summer or Christmas break, and she kept asking me to take it over to him and I wouldn't and I'm not, I mean, I'm rebellious but I'm not disobedient like that and she could not under--and finally, she was like, "Take the mail over!" and I spilled why I wouldn't. Of course, at that point, so much time had passed no one at that point was talking and we just didn't do anything legal, but then, and this now, I'm sure I've got the timing right on this. This, the second year of graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina], and this is hard to believe but he actually hit me in the face. He was walking. In certain ways this galls me even more because, like, all right, but I was standing in my front yard, it was Christmas, I was coming home. He was walking his dog past our front yard. The dog comes into the yard to use the bathroom, which I just saw as --- and so I screamed at him to get his dog off my yard because--Jesus!-- and then he screamed back, came into the yard, we got into each other's face, and he hit me. So I called the police for that! Right? End up in court and telling the judge who this person is to me, what he had done to me, and the judge, (unclear) judge says, "well, I mean, I don't know anything about that, if there is any report of anything like that; this just sounds like neighbors and so go home and be nice to each other." And, basically you know my mom's enjoyment of that neighborhood ended from the time that she knew, so she had enjoyed and loved her neighborhood, she is a gardener, she always loved to garden, but like her garden was the line of their property and so it really, so, part of the reason I never told was because sure enough, once I did and once that happened, it just made the whole experience for everyone there very, very ugly and awful, and it wasn't long after that, after the court thing happened, because even though the judge did nothing, his wife heard me say what I said and people who rape teenagers, grown men who do that, are not single-time perpetrators. It's never true, and I suspect that as the wife she also understood that he had probably perpetrated in other circumstances, whatever those were, because very shortly thereafter their marriage broke up and the family moved, but yeah, and again, I talk about being a survivor on air, but I have never had a conversation with my father about it.

 I stayed another semester and took on, what was my minor ended up being a double major, psychology and sociology but I technically still say sociology is still my minor because I just did it because I needed to be in school until I could decide what I wanted to do. And that's when I chose, because I had not even chosen a senior topic and so I chose a senior topic and I chose sexual assault because my freshman year somebody was sexually assaulted. I'm telling you this out of chronological order because it matters in the scheme of things. So somebody was sexually assaulted by a football player and I, she came to my dorm room and my room is called "The rec" and it had R-E-C like recreation center because I went to college with a big TV and radio that's all not here or there [KL laughs], but I went to college with way too much stuff that wasn't really necessary for a college dorm. They didn't know. They knew I needed a TV and radio so they were like, "Sure!" 16 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So anyways she came to the rec to tell us what happened and that was my first introduction to rape or sexual assault or knowing anybody who openly said that they were sexually assaulted. And she told us what happened, but she didn't want to do anything. She didn't want to tell anybody. She just needed to tell somebody because she walked into the dorm crying, distraught, what have you. So I said, "Oh we can do something." She said "Well, I don't want to do anything." And so I was trying to Ã¯Â¬Âgure out what we could do without saying who it was and it was football players. And so I thought we could take on the football players and I did. Needless to say, nothing changed for them. However they will remember that that's when it sparked for me that, "Oh, there's agencies that do something about this so we should at least have information available for people, for young women," and so rape crisis stuff became available in our dorms because I just didn't know what else to do at that point. So that's what I did I Ã¯Â¬Âgured out who would know what to do. So that is how I chose my senior topic and I interviewed the Rape Crisis Center of Cumberland County and decided, "Oh this is pretty interesting. Like people can do this for a living and I don't have to be a p
ychiatrist to actually help people?" And so I did the paper and, a joint paper actually. I did it on African Americans who were sexually assaulted because then I became intrigued by incest and child sexual abuse and how it became very much a family thing. And of course I really only did African Americans because I was one and wanted to be able to ask my family who clearly was not interested in disclosing all these things. But I really had more of a conversation with my grandmother and my great aunt because I wanted a perspective from them, given everything was swept under the rug then. 17 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So I wrote the paper and I knew I was going to graduate in December and by that time I had already met who now is my husband. We had started dating that last year that I was at school and I didn't know when I wanted to get my Masters then because I knew I wasn't going to take any biology or botany [KL and PV laugh, 25:00]. So I didn't really know what a career choice was. I just knew that I wanted to do something to help people. And the thing that I always will say about Thomasville High School and the Thomasville School Systems, which they knew very little I would say, but they knew how to score aptitude tests and it was right. In the seventh grade a teacher told me, "You will do something to help people. That's innately who you are and it's what matters to you and it's what is important." She said "You scored very well in all of these other things, but everything came back to people." And that's true; it's in my DNA somehow. And so my husband, who is not my husband got a job in a small town in Scotland county as a math teacher and he called me because he graduated before I did and he was like, "There's a job at a rape crisis center and it is just now opening," and I was like, "Oh, why not?" So I went to interview with two people and I stood up to walk out and they were like "So when can you start work?" I was twenty, I wasn't even twenty-one yet and I was like, I'm pretty sure there are some question I should be asking, but since I didn't know what they were. I said, "I will call you back." So at any rate, so we had a conversation and they officially offered me the job. It's funny now because I think about the salary and I think, "Wow, that's pennies," but it clearly was still not pennies to people who grew up in a small town. Because even to my family they weren't, two things they weren't happy about that I was moving to 18 Monika Iohnson-Hostler a small town with somebody that I wasn't married to [PV laughs]. So those became problems, not so much with my parents. I think with my mother I think she already knew she could trust me like, the mistake that I made I did everything to make it up. So I think if nothing else, my mother knew that I was at least responsible and that I would always make good decisions and that she had done her job well. My grandparents on the other hand, not so much [KL and PV laugh]. I mean I think they knew I was still a good kid, but they were still concerned about an adult decision I was making. Paris Vaughn: And old fashioned. MJH: And very old fashioned. And I, you know, people are like, "Oh yeah very religious," and I'm like, "My grandfather didn't go to church I don't think you'd call what he was thinking religious" [All laugh]. My grandmother, yes sure she was religious. My grandfather, erm I'm not sure we could go with religious. I think he was going with, "Oh lord my oldest granddaughter is going to live with a man that we don't know." Because they are old fashioned in that, you know my husband is not from a small town. He's a military kid. He grew up all over the country. He didn't eat meat. All of these things were foreign to my family who just wasn't really sure about him. But anyway I, I did it I took the job and it was the Executive Director who actually is back at UNC; she's a student at the school government. And she was my first boss and she's still a wonderful person in my life and really really tried to push me to go back and get my masters. And I still didn't know what I wanted to do I was like no, because I don't love school I happen to do well, I don't love it, hence that Ã¯Â¬Ârst 19 Monika Iohnson-Hostler year in college [all laugh]. But I didn't know what I wanted to be and so I loved the job that I was doing. So I stayed on the job and I, the agency was a Rape Crisis Center and it started doing Domestic Violence and I had a couple of children and I knew that I probably would not be able to do direct services for long because there was not a systematic answer to stop what I was seeing. And for somebody who always thought that I could figure out an answer to the unjust and to the things that aren't fair I didn't have an answer to them. Society didn't, which still doesn't quite make sense to me and I've been doing this work now for almost seventeen years. I'm still not sure how as a society we don't keep our children safe and I think that was another turning point for me to realize that, "Okay I can't do direct services because clearly I don't have children. I cannot take all of these children into my home." I was in my twenties. That probably was not going to Ã¯Â¬Â‚y with my now husband either that I was bringing a bunch of kids home. The threats from perpetrators and abusers never bothered me. I didn't fear people who used physical or sexual Violence to have power over someone so I was never afraid. And it was a small town so I had quite a few threats but those things never bothered me. It was the children. I, I just didn't know why as a society nobody thought to make it their job to Ã¯Â¬Âgure out how to keep them safe. So intervention is still really important to me. It was important to me then, but I left there knowing that there had to be another side to the work that I was doing in the local community. So while I was at the rape crisis center in Scotland county I came on the board of NC CASA in 1997, still in my early 20's. I came on the board here and a job 20 Monika Iohnson-Hostler came open for the Campus Rape Prevention Coordinator, which everybody knows my history in how I came to this work [30:00]. And so the Executive Director said," I think you should apply because it's where your passion started and how do you work with college campuses to help them deal with sexual assault on college campuses." So I came here in 1999 to do rape prevention education on college campuses and to write a sexual assault model policy for college campuses. So I did that in conjunction with the person that was the director for the Duke Women's Center. And I've been here ever since and I've probably held every job at the coalition [KL laughs]. And I'm sure there are detailed questions that you want to know but that was my college and that's how I got to my career. PV: So you talked about how difÃ¯Â¬Âcult it was to especially work with children. What kind of steps have you taken throughout your career to perform self care and to prevent burning out in this job? MJH: So it's the same lesson that I learned in elementary school that I cannot win the war Ã¯Â¬Âghting every small battle. And so I come to work and I work hard every day and it's also how I, my work is now more policy oriented because I believe system issues, they don't have policies in place and now my second issue is there is now no accountability for the policies. Now that I know how to write policy I have to Ã¯Â¬Âgure out how to get other agencies to implement the policies that they now have. But for me the selfÃ¢Â€Â”care is my family. I mean I have a support system still the same people outside of my grandparents who are all deceased now. But my support system is unreal. They keep me grounded and let me know that what I do is important but more important is ifI'm not here I can't do the things I like. And so I 21 Monika Iohnson-Hostler have a best friend who is my first cousin, who we're six weeks apart; it's my dad's niece. And she, well I'm not sure who keeps her grounded, but she is absolutely a comedian and keeps me in stitches. And she and my husband and my mother are all the same person to me, they all have the same spirit. So I know that for me my life is surrounded by nurturers because I give a whole lot. I'm now at a place where I can say that about myself, that I give everything to people or to whatever I'm passionate about I give. And so I am very very blessed to have people who give to me because they know that I'm not going to do it willingly on my own. You know, those three, there are lots of people, but those three people are my best friend, my husband, and my mother are my nurturers and they make sure that I know that there's lots more important things and fun things that I can do that don't require me to be stressed. Now my husband does have to remind me. "Oh gosh, like you don't have to fix it ifit's really broken," if we're doing something that is so not related to work, like I don't have to Ã¯Â¬Âx everything and I do have that tendency to want to Ã¯Â¬Âgure it out. And then I have a six year old so I have lots, I mean well Ã¯Â¬Ârst of all she has her own schedule that requires me to not burn out. I would deÃ¯Â¬Ânitely say before my daughter I probably worked a lot. I don't take sick leave. I took sick leave because I was on bed rest for my daughter. But I don't stay out of work. I have chronic respiratory issues and I deal with them. That's also being raised in a family who didn't have sick days and so I also realized that sick days don't make sense to me because they were never able to stay home sick. And so I now know that because I'm able to analyze why I don't take sick days [all laugh]. Of course I don't take sick days because I don't feel sick but I don't take sick days because you have to be sick 22 Monika Iohnson-Hostler to be out of work. And I operate that way. So I'm a little old-fashioned old-school and I learned from my grandparents. I don't behave that way as an employer but I do operate that way. So once a year I take a lot oftime off. My husband is a teacher, so I take most of December offbecause he's out most of December and then now that my daughter is in school I don't work full weeks when she's out of school. So that's why it's been hard to get me for the interview [KL laughs]. And I, so I have a lot of meetings which make me end up working for over forty hours. But in the summer I try not to work forty hours I try to be home for her activities so my husband isn't the person who's seeing her do whatever activity she's in. So that keeps me grounded. And I don't think I burn out because I do this work from a place of pity or a place of exhaustion. I do it from a place of changing society and that doesn't make me tired. People that I see burn out come to work and get overwhelmed by a job and I don't see what I do as a job. I just think I live it, or at least I try to. Clearly I have not mastered that because if so there would be a whole lot changed in society so I have not mastered it, but I live it. So, so I don't know. I just haven't really experienced burn out and I think it's because I truly believe [35:00] what I do is not work and I also believe that those people keep me grounded in my life outside of this ofÃ¯Â¬Âce. Although I am glued to my email [KL and PV laugh], but that doesn't seem like work to me. I'm a wired employee that's what I say. PV: So what exactly do you guys do here? MJH: Okay, sorry there is a surprise bridal shower happening in the office [PV and KL laugh], which I thought it was happening at twelve so I thought you would 23 Monika Iohnson-Hostler miss it. I apologize. That's what happens when you're out ofthe office most of the time. So at NC CASA we're a statewide organization that is a membership organization for the ninety plus rape crisis centers in North Carolina. So every county is served by a rape crisis center but there are about sixty-three court agencies that have offices in about ninety-two counties. But then they have staff covering the other eight counties that there are not a physical ofÃ¯Â¬Âce for sexual assault. So they provide direct services which is what I did in Scotland County for many years. But we do the training for those advocates. We also do law 
nforcement training on sexual assault specifically so impact of sexual Violence, prevalence and how to interview sexual assault survivors. We also train sexual assault nurse examiners forensic nurses on evidence collection and the importance of the survivor because what they do is scientific and what we do is let them know that that is a human being that is the evidence. And so we provide training there. We also provide training for anybody who needs it. We have a campus consortium which now we have probably over forty campuses who are a part of our campus consortium so they have their own advisory committee of campuses and we provide prevention training to them and with them because a lot of them now have federal grants that they have at their school universities to do sexual Violence or domestic Violence preventions; but we do the sexual assault side ofthings. And we also work with all of the state agencies on writing model policies. So we just wrote a policy on new research because I wrote one in 99. There wasn't a lot of research but now there's lots of research. And we also have an administration, our presidential administration who has this as a priority issue. So of course it helps to have the Vice 24 Monika Iohnson-Hostler president that has a, "One is too many," website on sexual assault that happens on college campuses. So that's a huge initiative for us, which we want to work on with the department of public health. You all interviewed the council for women so you all know they're a funder and we are, statutorily the coalition provides training to the agencies that they fund which are the rape crisis centers. So they fund direct services and we train direct service providers. So there is a lot ofturnover because now that I'm older I know that they really don't make a lot of money to do work that is stressful and that absolutely has a high turnover and burnout rate. I just did my Ã¯Â¬Ârst career fair at my daughter's elementary school and I realized this is not a career that anyone will ever tell you that you can ever have. So I'm looking in her yearbook and it actually has where I work, but they asked me to come talk about being a non-proÃ¯Â¬Ât director and I said, "Well that is really great of them to put where I work," because now somebody knows that is a career. Because even in college this isn't a career choice you'd think that you would do. Even women's studies majors, a lot of them think about policy which is now where I now spend the bulk of my time. So that's what we do our work revolves around training and education for direct service providers whether they are rape crisis centers or we call them allied professionals or first responders who would be involved in a sexual assault case, and then campuses. But we also do prevention work, which is also training people how to do prevention so society systematically understands that it is our job to change to prevent children from being sexually abused, not children and not just singularly parents but systems are also a part of that. So we do systems work as 25 Monika Iohnson-Hostler well which is mostly translated into policy. So we do both state and federal policy and so, which there will be a trend here. So in that I'm also the chair of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, which I have been for, my daughter's six so almost six years. I know that's a long time to be a chair [all laugh]. But it is a policy making body so all of our work and there's no staff so we're all volunteer so I tell people my 6-10 job which is when I leave here is to work with federal policy. That is in both writing and advocating for it, and that advocacy isn't just to Congress on the importance of passing legislation but it's also to agencies so that they understand why it's important that the policy governs their work. So that's my current focus, as a public policy in legislation. PV: So when you go to different meetings what exactly goes on at those meetings? MJH: I know that's like the million-dollar question. I think everybody in my family including my husband and daughter are like 'why do you have so many meetings?Ã¢Â€Â™ [KL laughs, 40:00] So we have a lot of meetings because there's probably not a state entity that isn't impacted by our work. So that's health, that's human services, that's schools, that's universities, you know, it's department of administration. It's every agency or cabinet level agency that should be concerned about these issues. So we've done a good job because there is a state sexual assault coalition in all fifty states and territories including Washington D.C. So I'm a counterpart in all those states and territories which [cheer in the background from bridal shower, MJH laughs] make up the alliance the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. And so a lot of those meetings are for really helping them understand 26 Monika Iohnson-Hostler where sexual Violence is integrated. So we're in the room so we at least understand that they should be there, but they don't necessarily always understand why I say, "I'm Monika Johnson-Hostler from the North Carolina Coalition to End Sexual Assault". Everybody in the room doesn't necessarily understand why we are there, so my job is to say why we are there. So if it's funding priorities you know I'm there to say to them, "You know sexual assault does this, this is what prevalence looks like in the school system. This is what prevalence looks like in you know adult facilities or nursing homes or group homes." So I always tell people there's probably not a facet of life that I can't probably tell you how it's connected because sexual assault happens across the lifespan and there are no boundaries. And so there's almost not somewhere we can't integrate sexual Violence. And it should be because again to get to, I really do come to work so that there is not a work for me to come to and that can't happen without convincing the rest of the world that it matters, and that we are the only ones that can keep women and children primarily safe. Because you know we have a society that allows perpetrators to continue to perpetrate; if we didn't we wouldn't still be dealing with it so. So that's what I'm doing at those meetings, telling them why it matters [KL and PV laugh] and how it fits into whatever they're talking about. KL: Oh wow. Would you consider yourselfa feminist? MJH: Umm, I think theoretically I'm a feminist. I don't--well a couple things. I would never call myself a feminist. I agree with feminist principles. I, you know, without a shadow ofa doubt think Gloria Steinem is one of the most brilliant women who has really brought to light feminists in this century and in my lifetime. Would I 27 Monika Iohnson-Hostler say I was a feminist throughout the theoretical principles of feminism? No because I don't think feminists included women of color. I'm a firm advocate that Sojourner Truth that IE. Wells laid the foundation for black women to be included in women having equal rights. So you know people like to couch African American women as a women who had to make a decision between women's rights and women's suffrage, and my issue is that real feminists would have recognized that that's not really a choice that African American women could have made because they don't get to choose which one they are first. They just are. And so I do believe that feminist perspective understands that today. But I've never called myself one because I understand the historical context in being who I am and I critically analyze things and things that matter. I've just never chosen to call myself a feminist. Am I offended by it? No. do I live by feminist principles? Absolutely. But it's almost like when I was in kindergarten. I probably wouldn't have chosen to call myself a black girl either but I didn't really have much choice [all laugh]. So it is what it is. I think feminists, I think understanding feminist principles is important. There are principles that I teach my daughter every day. But there are principles that I was taught and I don't think my mother or my grandmother understood what feminism meant. They just knew that this is right and this is what you have the opportunity to do because you get to live and breathe on this earth and so why wouldn't you have the same opportunities to make choices that are right for you? And so to me that is, I'm not sure that feminist theory keeps it that simple [KL and PV laugh], but that is what feminist theory means to me and so I would consider 28 Monika Iohnson-Hostler those principles or indoctrine into my life and how I live and also teach them to my daughter. KL: Even though the center isn't directly for women who have been abused do you still have women that come in? MJH: We do, women, men, and children. And so we have two MSW's on staff, which have different jobs but it is important that we maintain somebody on staff who provided direct services other than me [laughs] which I can handle it all. I still take crisis calls if I'm the only one available. But we also have a staff attorney so a lot of the questions that we tend to get now are more about their legal recourse, or is there legal recourse, or is there civil recourse; so both criminal and civil recourse. Most of the calls and clients we get really want our help [45:00] and guidance on the legal system. PV: 0k. KL: What do you think is the role of men who want to serve as allies to the anti-sexual Violence and anti-rape movements? MJH: So I have men on staffhere so I think they are integral to this work. My husband and I went on a vacation with some friends and one of the things he said which I think speaks to my thought on men in the movement, which I might add happened in 1998 right before we got married so I didn't realize that this would be about how I thought men were in the movement. But again I think it matters. I think everyone has a role in this work. I don't think, just like any other major, you know, political or human rights or social justice issue, it can't be stopped by the people who were persecuted. So there has always had to be allies in those that have 29 Monika Iohnson-Hostler privilege and power and that I also believe that those--which are in feminist principles--that you know, that the majority, whether it is men or whether it's based on race or sexual orientation or ability, there is always a privileged side of the coin. And so if those people with privilege and power aren't engaged in the work then we can keep doing the work but we're pushing up against in most cases the people who are perpetrating whatever it is and in my case it's sexual Violence. So the majority of perpetrators are men. We clearly have women who perpetrate, but the majority are men. And so I believe that other men have to hold men accountable because there are more good men then there are men who rape and so if the majority of those men do their work and are allies and really setting the standard--. My husband's a teacher. He teaches math. His job is to still integrate what I do, that it's important that you respect women even before our daughter. And he does that. I tell people every day, "If my husband could figure out how to integrate sexual Violence prevention in math [KL and PV laugh], you can figure out how to integrate it anywhere. So I guess what I would say is I've always known the importance of men in the work. But I do have some feelings about it that I think we're going to have to work out in this work. That men have come into this work and I've said to men that come into the work, they come in and they charge their worth because again that's a privilege that men have. Men tend to say, "we'll charge $10,000 just to tell you why men should be allies." People ask me to come speak all the time, I'm like, "Oh it's free." NCCASA doesn't have travel so you may have to pay for my plane ticket, but like those things don't matter because most of the women who do this work do it because it matters and because it is important to them and I 30 Monika Iohnson-Hostler think men that come to this work believe that. But men are also socialized very differently than women and so they ask for their worth. And I don't think that's wrong, but I do think it matters in the work because now we're able to see yet again a disparity being played out in a work where we're trying to move to equality for men and women. KL: Right. MJH: Because the anti-rape movement that's about ending rape but it's also about social justice and equality and liVing in a culture where women and girls are not hyper-sexualized so that they do have, they are coming to the table with some forms of privilege and power that are not associated with being male or of a certain race or a certain dominant group and all of those things I think are interwoven into our work. If I do this work from a place of know that the most vulnerable people to being sexually violated are on the other side ofthe non-privileged side of the coin. So people of color, people that have disabilities, people who you know are female. People who are children, people who don't live, their sexual preference is not heterosexual which is dominant in this culture. Like all of those people are closer to the margin of vulnerability in sexual Violence and we know this based off of prevalence numbers. The amnesty report among Native Americans I think has been eye opening to this country for people who have been listening even a little bit. To see that all of those things matter how we treat people in this country. KL: Right [laughs]. 31 Monika Iohnson-Hostler MJH: Again there's probably not a thing that you can't come up with that I cannot integrate this in. So that's my framework. Right or wrong that's how I live. That's Monika's philosophy. KL: I don't think I have any more questions unless you do Paris. PV: Me neither. KL: Great well thank you so much. PV: Thank you. MJH: No problem. It pays to interview a talker [all laugh]. Yeah I needed the probey questions at first because I was like, "I'm not sure what you really want to know." Once I Ã¯Â¬Âgured out that you wanted to know all of the stages of my life I figured out how to tell you...

 I stayed another semester and took on, what was my minor ended up being a double major, psychology and sociology but I technically still say sociology is still my minor because I just did it because I needed to be in school until I could decide what I wanted to do. And that's when I chose, because I had not even chosen a senior topic and so I chose a senior topic and I chose sexual assault because my freshman year somebody was sexually assaulted. I'm telling you this out of chronological order because it matters in the scheme of things. So somebody was sexually assaulted by a football player and I, she came to my dorm room and my room is called "The rec" and it had R-E-C like recreation center because I went to college with a big TV and radio that's all not here or there [KL laughs], but I went to college with way too much stuff that wasn't really necessary for a college dorm. They didn't know. They knew I needed a TV and radio so they were like, "Sure!" 16 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So anyways she came to the rec to tell us what happened and that was my first introduction to rape or sexual assault or knowing anybody who openly said that they were sexually assaulted. And she told us what happened, but she didn't want to do anything. She didn't want to tell anybody. She just needed to tell somebody because she walked into the dorm crying, distraught, what have you. So I said, "Oh we can do something." She said "Well, I don't want to do anything." And so I was trying to Ã¯Â¬Âgure out what we could do without saying who it was and it was football players. And so I thought we could take on the football players and I did. Needless to say, nothing changed for them. However they will remember that that's when it sparked for me that, "Oh, there's agencies that do something about this so we should at least have information available for people, for young women," and so rape crisis stuff became available in our dorms because I just didn't know what else to do at that point. So that's what I did I Ã¯Â¬Âgured out who would know what to do. So that is how I chose my senior topic and I interviewed the Rape Crisis Center of Cumberland County and decided, "Oh this is pretty interesting. Like people can do this for a living and I don't have to be a p
ychiatrist to actually help people?" And so I did the paper and, a joint paper actually. I did it on African Americans who were sexually assaulted because then I became intrigued by incest and child sexual abuse and how it became very much a family thing. And of course I really only did African Americans because I was one and wanted to be able to ask my family who clearly was not interested in disclosing all these things. But I really had more of a conversation with my grandmother and my great aunt because I wanted a perspective from them, given everything was swept under the rug then.

But I didn't know what I wanted to be and so I loved the job that I was doing. So I stayed on the job and I, the agency was a Rape Crisis Center and it started doing Domestic Violence and I had a couple of children and I knew that I probably would not be able to do direct services for long because there was not a systematic answer to stop what I was seeing. And for somebody who always thought that I could figure out an answer to the unjust and to the things that aren't fair I didn't have an answer to them. Society didn't, which still doesn't quite make sense to me and I've been doing this work now for almost seventeen years. I'm still not sure how as a society we don't keep our children safe and I think that was another turning point for me to realize that, "Okay I can't do direct services because clearly I don't have children. I cannot take all of these children into my home." I was in my twenties. That probably was not going to Ã¯Â¬Â‚y with my now husband either that I was bringing a bunch of kids home. The threats from perpetrators and abusers never bothered me. I didn't fear people who used physical or sexual Violence to have power over someone so I was never afraid. And it was a small town so I had quite a few threats but those things never bothered me. It was the children. I, I just didn't know why as a society nobody thought to make it their job to Ã¯Â¬Âgure out how to keep them safe. So intervention is still really important to me. It was important to me then, but I left there knowing that there had to be another side to the work that I was doing in the local community. So while I was at the rape crisis center in Scotland county I came on the board of NC CASA in 1997, still in my early 20's. I came on the board here and a job 20 Monika Iohnson-Hostler came open for the Campus Rape Prevention Coordinator, which everybody knows my history in how I came to this work [30:00]. And so the Executive Director said," I think you should apply because it's where your passion started and how do you work with college campuses to help them deal with sexual assault on college campuses." So I came here in 1999 to do rape prevention education on college campuses and to write a sexual assault model policy for college campuses. So I did that in conjunction with the person that was the director for the Duke Women's Center. And I've been here ever since and I've probably held every job at the coalition [KL laughs]. And I'm sure there are detailed questions that you want to know but that was my college and that's how I got to my career.

So at NC CASA we're a statewide organization that is a membership organization for the ninety plus rape crisis centers in North Carolina. So every county is served by a rape crisis center but there are about sixty-three court agencies that have offices in about ninety-two counties. But then they have staff covering the other eight counties that there are not a physical ofÃ¯Â¬Âce for sexual assault. So they provide direct services which is what I did in Scotland County for many years. But we do the training for those advocates. We also do law 
nforcement training on sexual assault specifically so impact of sexual Violence, prevalence and how to interview sexual assault survivors. We also train sexual assault nurse examiners forensic nurses on evidence collection and the importance of the survivor because what they do is scientific and what we do is let them know that that is a human being that is the evidence. And so we provide training there. We also provide training for anybody who needs it. We have a campus consortium which now we have probably over forty campuses who are a part of our campus consortium so they have their own advisory committee of campuses and we provide prevention training to them and with them because a lot of them now have federal grants that they have at their school universities to do sexual Violence or domestic Violence preventions; but we do the sexual assault side ofthings. And we also work with all of the state agencies on writing model policies. So we just wrote a policy on new research because I wrote one in 99. There wasn't a lot of research but now there's lots of research. And we also have an administration, our presidential administration who has this as a priority issue. So of course it helps to have the Vice 24 Monika Iohnson-Hostler president that has a, "One is too many," website on sexual assault that happens on college campuses. So that's a huge initiative for us, which we want to work on with the department of public health. You all interviewed the council for women so you all know they're a funder and we are, statutorily the coalition provides training to the agencies that they fund which are the rape crisis centers. So they fund direct services and we train direct service providers. So there is a lot ofturnover because now that I'm older I know that they really don't make a lot of money to do work that is stressful and that absolutely has a high turnover and burnout rate. I just did my Ã¯Â¬Ârst career fair at my daughter's elementary school and I realized this is not a career that anyone will ever tell you that you can ever have. So I'm looking in her yearbook and it actually has where I work, but they asked me to come talk about being a non-proÃ¯Â¬Ât director and I said, "Well that is really great of them to put where I work," because now somebody knows that is a career. Because even in college this isn't a career choice you'd think that you would do. Even women's studies majors, a lot of them think about policy which is now where I now spend the bulk of my time. So that's what we do our work revolves around training and education for direct service providers whether they are rape crisis centers or we call them allied professionals or first responders who would be involved in a sexual assault case, and then campuses. But we also do prevention work, which is also training people how to do prevention so society systematically understands that it is our job to change to prevent children from being sexually abused, not children and not just singularly parents but systems are also a part of that. So we do systems work as 25 Monika Iohnson-Hostler well which is mostly translated into policy. So we do both state and federal policy and so, which there will be a trend here. So in that I'm also the chair of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, which I have been for, my daughter's six so almost six years. I know that's a long time to be a chair [all laugh]. But it is a policy making body so all of our work and there's no staff so we're all volunteer so I tell people my 6-10 job which is when I leave here is to work with federal policy. That is in both writing and advocating for it, and that advocacy isn't just to Congress on the importance of passing legislation but it's also to agencies so that they understand why it's important that the policy governs their work. So that's my current focus, as a public policy in legislation.

So we have a lot of meetings because there's probably not a state entity that isn't impacted by our work. So that's health, that's human services, that's schools, that's universities, you know, it's department of administration. It's every agency or cabinet level agency that should be concerned about these issues. So we've done a good job because there is a state sexual assault coalition in all fifty states and territories including Washington D.C. So I'm a counterpart in all those states and territories which [cheer in the background from bridal shower, MJH laughs] make up the alliance the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. And so a lot of those meetings are for really helping them understand 26 Monika Iohnson-Hostler where sexual Violence is integrated. So we're in the room so we at least understand that they should be there, but they don't necessarily always understand why I say, "I'm Monika Johnson-Hostler from the North Carolina Coalition to End Sexual Assault". Everybody in the room doesn't necessarily understand why we are there, so my job is to say why we are there. So if it's funding priorities you know I'm there to say to them, "You know sexual assault does this, this is what prevalence looks like in the school system. This is what prevalence looks like in you know adult facilities or nursing homes or group homes." So I always tell people there's probably not a facet of life that I can't probably tell you how it's connected because sexual assault happens across the lifespan and there are no boundaries. And so there's almost not somewhere we can't integrate sexual Violence. And it should be because again to get to, I really do come to work so that there is not a work for me to come to and that can't happen without convincing the rest of the world that it matters, and that we are the only ones that can keep women and children primarily safe. Because you know we have a society that allows perpetrators to continue to perpetrate; if we didn't we wouldn't still be dealing with it so. So that's what I'm doing at those meetings, telling them why it matters [KL and PV laugh] and how it fits into whatever they're talking about.

 There was also, at the timeÃ¢Â€Â”thi5 kind of swings towards the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s issue.

EB: My mother worked for the military. She worked for Army Community Service, which is basically like being a social worker in the civilian world when I was growing up. She ran the food bank, and they provide emergency support to soldiers, counseling, things like that, and she also for a period of time really worked on domestic violence. I still remember one night where we were having dinner and she had to go to a soldier&#8217;s apartment because he was beating his wife and she tried to hit him with a car. This was in Germany when I was little. So she dealt with a lot of cases of sexual assault and cases of domestic violence in the military. And now my mother, she still works for the military. Then she went to work for the Coast Guard for a few years. She did very similar work because [the military is] almost like a different-- it&#8217;s not a different world, but it&#8217;s like a world within a world.

(Laughs) McConnell It was actually set up by a couple of OU football players. They had teamed up with a lady by the name of Sister Rosemary Nyirumbe . She s done a lot of talks here in Oklahoma and has a book. She was even named one of Time s Fifty Most Influential People. I believe it was last year. She has a school over in Uganda. She takes on women that have been displaced by the Lord s Resistance Army, or the LRAs, that came through Uganda, terrorized a lot of the villages. A lot of the women got raped and had children out of wedlock. It s very frowned upon over there, and so most of them couldn t go home to their families. She took all these women in, took on their babies and their children, and taught them all a trade so that they could support themselves. She would teach them to sew or to do things, clerical things, and gave them a new life. When Pros for Africa got teamed up with her, they decided to make this big trip. Feed the Children went, and the Starkey Hearing Aid Foundation went. That s why my mentor called me is because the hearing foundation was going to be there. He was like, Hey, do you want to come? I m like, Yeah What do I have to do to make this happen? I ended up going to Uganda for ten days. The fun part with that one was ten NFL players also went with us because of the Pros for Africa connections. Adrian Peterson was one of the guys that helped set it up in the beginning. He may be one of the few ones that s still playing that went on the trip. So we had these back then at least, they were all, most of them were still playing. Getting to go to Africa with those guys was a whole different experience, a much different kind of trip than the first time we went to Africa. We definitely had Wi-Fi in our hotels; we had swimming pools; we had power. We had Uganda CIA that escorted us to everywhere we went because they weren t going to let these famous athletes have problems or be attacked in their country. We definitely had very, very high security everywhere we went.

When they would get into trouble, they would say, Where s Ms. Angela? It s not that I bailed them out, it s that I heard them out.

And at the same time, the year when I was adopted, my mother along with nine other women, founded the WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Coalition of St. Croix, and theyÃ¢Â€Â™re a domestic violence organization, and they help victims of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault. One of the founding members is Audre Lorde. So itÃ¢Â€Â™s through that work [that] there was a profound, really strong, political framework. You know, I grew up in this really close-knit, strong feminist community that was all around this organization, building the organization from the ground up. And so we would have conversations, you know, weÃ¢Â€Â™d talk about white supremacy at the dinner table, people knew what homophobia was, you know? There were lesbian couples that were part of our community, who had been together for like twenty years, ten years, and you know, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t like an issue; it was just thatÃ¢Â€Â™s who they were. And so I had like that, but I think thatÃ¢Â€Â”and then I had this other piece of the political framework that wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t so much about an analysis around oppressions, but that was also about a deep sense of justice and service and what activism meansÃ¢Â€Â”and itÃ¢Â€Â™s weird to even call it activism because so much of it feels like itÃ¢Â€Â™s just my lifeÃ¢Â€Â™s work. You know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not like this special thing I do on the side or anything; itÃ¢Â€Â™s just how you live your life, and what it means to actually mobilize people. So I grew up in that, and I grew up around a lot ofÃ¢Â€Â”the group that founded the coalition was a very multi-racial group of women of color, White women. I feel like from a young age, I really got a profound sense of, one, just seeing women organizing for themselves, when no one else would, and internalizing into my bones that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t need a college special course to do activism, you donÃ¢Â€Â™t need to go to a fancy training, you donÃ¢Â€Â™t need to know fancy language, or speak the Ã¢Â€ÂœrightÃ¢Â€Â way or all these ridiculous things that weÃ¢Â€Â™re taught now, and that the way that political work I feel like gets professionalized and this elitism around it. I just feel like from growing in that environment, I just saw people just being like, ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s a need in our community. We need to do something. How do we create what we need? And itÃ¢Â€Â™s not perfect, you learn as you go, but they did it, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s still alive now. And then the other thing I feel like I got from that experience growing up was just this deep profound understanding of violence and how systemic it was and how pervasive it was. And that it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just the fiveÃ¢Â€Â”it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just like my friends who were like experiencing violence, but it was everybody, particularly intimate violence, which is mostly what they worked on, but they worked on intimate violence in the contextÃ¢Â€Â”like everybody doesÃ¢Â€Â”of state violence, of all kinds of community violence, of everything. I remember spending Saturday afternoons in the waiting room, playing with kids as their moms went in and out to the counselors. In the early early days, people would spend the night at our house to escape in the middle of the night to fly off the island, because you canÃ¢Â€Â™t just drive to the next county or anything. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have the language for it, but I knew that it was larger than just a couple of bad people, you know what I mean? It was so many people and so many families, and so many different kinds of families. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just about poor people, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t about just women of color, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â”None of that mattered. It was all kinds of different folks, and I definitely got a deep sense of the engendered piece ofÃ¢Â€Â”or I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the correct way to say itÃ¢Â€Â”but the gender piece of how violence is perpetuated, particularly around women, folks who are identified as female, people who present as feminine, people who present as women, people who are mistaken as women, all of those things felt really profound as well. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know that I wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve had the fancy words to describe it then, but I know that I also came to a place inside of myself, like somethingÃ¢Â€Â”itÃ¢Â€Â™s like tectonic plates or somethingÃ¢Â€Â”something just shifted and aligned where I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to just be part of responding to violence, but I really wanted to be a part of making the violence stop. Because even though I knew that the work that my momÃ¢Â€Â™s organization did and the work that the women and the people who were in that community did all the timeÃ¢Â€Â”which ranged from everything from being part of the advocate hotline and going in the middle of the night to assist victims to running the beeper training program to helping to train the police to helping to run the organization to everything, to helping to cook the meals for the meeting. There was collective childcare all the time, because most of the people who were doing the main work were a lot of single mothers. There were a lot of people who didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have dual income households. There was a lot of death, there were a lot of hard times, and St. Croix has a lot of poverty on it as well. I saw that type of work, and so I knew it was really good work, but I also knew that it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t lessening the incidences of violence, and it was helping to create a culture where people could come out about violence and where people could address the consequences of violence and the impact of violence, but [it was] not necessarily doing anything to shift the reasons why violence was happening. And I donÃ¢Â€Â™t say that with any judgment, because I know and IÃ¢Â€Â™ve seen literally first hand as their organization just continues to grow, and theyÃ¢Â€Â™re still at capacity. Like they literally cannot help all the people who need help, and I think thatÃ¢Â€Â™s true for most of our direct service organizations, who are doing great work on the front linesÃ¢Â€Â”and you know, I mean obviously itÃ¢Â€Â™s neverÃ¢Â€Â”itÃ¢Â€Â™s not perfect, and thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot of critiques that people have and that I have as well and like I have a lot of respect for those people who are doing work in the trenches and on the front lines because itÃ¢Â€Â™s not easy work and they often times donÃ¢Â€Â™t have the support that they need like in terms ofÃ¢Â€Â”everything from like the constant intake of trauma that they have to the long hours to the little amounts of payÃ¢Â€Â”all that kind of stuff. But I think there was something about that kind of direct and immediate needs work that I saw that I just knew I wanted to be a part of building alternatives and like I said, at the time, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think I really had that language, but I feel like that really shaped me in terms of how I understood the rest of my political work.

. At the time, it was likeÃ¢Â€Â”itÃ¢Â€Â™s true in a lot of ways now, there are really just two branches in terms of feminist work that you can do. You can go into pro-choice and reproductive rights, health, or justice work or you can go into anti-violence and domestic violence and sexual assault, rape work. And I had done that [anti-violence] work, so I was like you know, this is the branch of the tree that IÃ¢Â€Â™m doing now, and it was great to seeÃ¢Â€Â”well I had gone with my partner at the time, whoÃ¢Â€Â™s White, and then my two close friends who are both Black women, and it was great to see like women of color there and present, but you know, I thinkÃ¢Â€Â”I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t really understand and I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if everybody else understood what it was for, you know what I mean? What was after the march?

KWON: Can you tell me a little bit more about the intersection between disability justice and RJ work? MINGUS: Yeah, yeah. So thereÃ¢Â€Â™s the intersection of the content, of course. I began just asking questions, and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s how it all started. They would give statistics around forced sterilization or around abortion or around sexual violence of women of color, or you know, all these different groups, and I would always ask, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, what about disabled women?Ã¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€ÂœWhat about disabled people?Ã¢Â€Â And they never had any statistics. So thereÃ¢Â€Â™s the content piece, I feel like, in terms of that there are disabled people who can get pregnant or there are disabled people who have reproductive needs or who need reproductive health.

 KWON: How are you able to take that framework of disability justice and apply it to your work? How is it relevant now to the work that you do here? MINGUS: So my work is in two broad pieces. My work is disability justice, so I apply it all the time there, and then I do transformative justice work. So in that work, I feel likeÃ¢Â€Â”The transformative justice work that I do is around community responses to child sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse is very, very pervasive, and just as the statistics that weÃ¢Â€Â™re given say that people who are identified or assigned as girls are twice as likely to be victims of child sexual abuse, the same statistics are true around disabled children and adults, because thereÃ¢Â€Â™s also developmental stuff that gets complicated. But actually, in terms of gender, we actually think itÃ¢Â€Â™s much moreÃ¢Â€Â”we think itÃ¢Â€Â™s much higher around people who get assigned as boys, too, but that thereÃ¢Â€Â™s less reporting. So itÃ¢Â€Â™s hard to know. I feel like my TJ [transformative justice] around child sexual abuse, or CSA, work is disability justice work, because I know so many people who are survivors of child sexual abuse who are disabled peopleÃ¢Â€Â”myself includedÃ¢Â€Â”and I know so many people whoÃ¢Â€Â”I know that disabled communities donÃ¢Â€Â™t talk it. No communities talk about child sexual abuse. So itÃ¢Â€Â™s not just disabled communities, but given the prevalence, I think that itÃ¢Â€Â™s something that disabled communities should be talking about and that most disabled children donÃ¢Â€Â™t have access to community, donÃ¢Â€Â™t have accessÃ¢Â€Â”ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s just so many more complications around disabled children, I feel like, that get added in around dependency and all that, so I feel like disability justice is certainly a huge piece of that work, too. And in that work, the people that I work with, IÃ¢Â€Â™m so fortunate to get to work with amazing people. Disability justice is a huge value and principle that we try to move forward in our work as well and try to stay aligned with. KWON: What kind of programs do you actually do? Could you tell me a little bit more about the organization itself? MINGUS: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not an organization. KWON: Oh, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not? MINGUS: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s a collective. So itÃ¢Â€Â™s a group of community folks whoÃ¢Â€Â”I mean, it sounds weird to say weÃ¢Â€Â™re all volunteers because itÃ¢Â€Â™s our lifeÃ¢Â€Â™s work, so itÃ¢Â€Â™s not like a volunteer thing, but none of us get paid currently. We have been meeting for two years. Our goal is to create transformative justice responses to child sexual abuse, so responses that donÃ¢Â€Â™t rely on the State, so people are able to intervene in incidences or cases of child sexual abuse without having to call the police, without having to just send somebody to prison, a response thatÃ¢Â€Â™s not just about resisting violence but also about how do we cultivate and create the world that we want, meaning the things that actually will prevent violence from happeningÃ¢Â€Â”like safety, healing, accountability, transformation, all those things. And so thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the work that weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing. Our vision is a Bay Area where everybody has the skills and the capacity to be able to intervene or prevent an act of or an incident of child sexual abuse. And so our work is a lotÃ¢Â€Â”ItÃ¢Â€Â™s very different. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s alternatives building work. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not direct needs or immediate needs work, which tends to be a lot of responding, responding. Our work isÃ¢Â€Â”I feel like itÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot slower and deeper, and so weÃ¢Â€Â™re working towards supporting our first trial intervention in three years, weÃ¢Â€Â™ll be doing that. Until then, what weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing is, currently right now, we are developing a possible accountability model for TJ intervention in CSA. WeÃ¢Â€Â™ve been studying accountability models and processes that have already taken placeÃ¢Â€Â”many of which are not around child sexual abuse, just given the unique risks involvedÃ¢Â€Â”but seeing whatÃ¢Â€Â™s transferrable and whatÃ¢Â€Â™s not, in terms of interventions that have been successful or where thereÃ¢Â€Â™s pieces of it that have been successful. And so thatÃ¢Â€Â™s one. WeÃ¢Â€Â™ll be having our first draft of that on October 1, which is so exciting. The other big piece is the provider network work that weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing. So the framework that weÃ¢Â€Â™re working in isÃ¢Â€Â”Given where weÃ¢Â€Â™re at, and given where we want to be, obviously we want to be where itÃ¢Â€Â™s like thereÃ¢Â€Â™s healers in every school, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s like accountability circles that are just community run that people do, and everybody knows how to run an accountability process, and you know, people donÃ¢Â€Â™t even need to be held accountable. They take accountability, right? They do something, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re like, I want to take accountability for this, right? ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not like, You did something wrong. Ever. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s where we want to be, and we know that thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a very long way between where we are and where we want to be. So in the mean time, what is the work going to look like? Obviously, we would love to have just a pure TJ intervention that never relies on the State and is totally community based and funded, whatever, but we know that thatÃ¢Â€Â™s notÃ¢Â€Â”We havenÃ¢Â€Â™t built to the scope and scale that would allow for that yet. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re still a relatively small group of people in terms of how large child sexual abuse is when we think of the statistics, which are one in four girls, and one in six boys. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s huge, right? That number. The other piece that we know is most children are abused by people that they know, that serial child sexual abusers are like less than 2%. Most people are sexually abused by people that they know or are in their intimate networks. So we have like the pervasiveness of CSA that weÃ¢Â€Â™re like trying to work on and hopefully end it, not just respond to it, and we havenÃ¢Â€Â™t built to the scope and scale that we want, so how do we leverage whatÃ¢Â€Â™s already here? How do we leverage whatÃ¢Â€Â™s already in place? So the provider network is going to be building a network of providers that weÃ¢Â
Â™re able to leverage their services in support of interventions. When we look at the landscape of child sexual abuse, we know that by far, the biggest the most significant gap is around offenders. If we think about survivors, bystanders and offenders, we know that the gap of services for offenders is huge. At leastÃ¢Â€Â”even if theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not perfectÃ¢Â€Â”thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot more services for survivors, and thereÃ¢Â€Â™s actually some services, a lot more services for by standers, whether itÃ¢Â€Â™s like educational groups, support groups, whatever. But when it comes to offenders, itÃ¢Â€Â™s pretty much like you either get locked up and put in jail, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot of pathologizing and therapeutic stuff, and then thereÃ¢Â€Â™s some smaller more innovative things, but thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the biggest gap, so we know that we want to work there, and then in the meantime, how do we leverage whatÃ¢Â€Â™s already existing? For survivors, how do we sort through those services and find which ones are good? Which are the best support groups? Or which of the support groups are trans* friendly? Which of the support groups are not going to tell on you or report you if youÃ¢Â€Â™re undocumented? Which of the support groups are held in accessible spaces, right? All of those things. Who is a gynecologist that we could recommend you to or refer you to that you could actually come out as a CSA survivor and they wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be an asshole to you, or that they would know and be competent around some of the impacts that that might mean for not just your medical health but your emotional health as well and have a good bedside manner around that. So in the provider network, itÃ¢Â€Â™s people who are either aligned with transformative justice, people who are movable, like if thereÃ¢Â€Â™s just one person in the organization, for example, or somebody whoÃ¢Â€Â™s like, Yes, I know, because IÃ¢Â€Â™m seeing firsthand how the system doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t work, I donÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â”I know we need something different, but I just donÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â™ have enough education, or people who are just the bests in their fields. So weÃ¢Â€Â™re having our first gathering of that at the end of this week actually, which is super exciting. The other thing that weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing in that provider network is that weÃ¢Â€Â™re we just had our first draft of the system maps, which are visual maps for people to be able to see what the different pathways are if you decide to engage the State, or if somebody elseÃ¢Â€Â”like if your neighbor calls CPS [Child Protective Services] on you. So that you can literally see, Okay, if CPS comes and gets involved, here is what the process looks like. Here is the number of times youÃ¢Â€Â™ll have to show up in court. Here are the decision makers at each step. HereÃ¢Â€Â™s what you need to know in terms of if somebody calls 911 vs. CPS. All of that. So that feels really exciting, too, to use as like a tool to educate people but also, again, like knowing that one of the defining characteristics of living with oppression is that you have to make really hard choices, and the choices you have are not choicesÃ¢Â€Â”I mean you already know the critique of the pro-choice movementÃ¢Â€Â”and theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not always just. So weÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to also figure out how do we work with what we have, knowing that for some people because we havenÃ¢Â€Â™t built to the scope and scale yet thatÃ¢Â€Â”We want to be able to hold survivor healing and maybe even accountability, to be able to hold bystander education and maybe accountability and healing here, too, to be able to hold offender transformation, accountability, all of that. We canÃ¢Â€Â™t hold all of that yet, and we want to get to a place where we can, obviously, so what does it look like in the meantime? So thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the scope of our work right now, which feels exciting. KWON: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s huge. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s a really big vision. MINGUS: Yeah, yeah, but we also think this isÃ¢Â€Â”and I remember coming to this realization when I was doing reproductive justice work in AtlantaÃ¢Â€Â”that a lot of people were not going to the clinic, not because they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have a state issued ID, or because they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have anybody to watch their kid in the middle of the day, or because they were scared that [the providers] were going to be queerphobic or transphobic. A lot of people werenÃ¢Â€Â™t going to seek reproductive health, because they had survived sexual violence and they were like, I just donÃ¢Â€Â™t deal with anything around any of that. I feel like I reallyÃ¢Â€Â”and so many of the people that I talked to and ended up working with had been survivors of child sexual abuse as well, and that that was just something that was a huge barrier around not only them seeking reproductive health services but also in their ability to be able to be involved in a lot of work. A lot of people were still carrying huge amounts of trauma and still had a lot of healing that they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t [do], because they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have access to healing services or anything like that. Coming into the work, I started with the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative, and we partnered with Generation Five, really coming into the work around a clear strategic vision around likeÃ¢Â€Â”Given how prevalent child sexual abuse is and given how devastating the impacts are in our communityÃ¢Â€Â”If it really is one in four girls and one in six boys, and those are just estimates, they say. They actually estimate that itÃ¢Â€Â™s much higher than that, given that most people donÃ¢Â€Â™t even report child sexual abuse. So if we know that itÃ¢Â€Â™s probably higher than one in four girls and one in six boys, given the prevalence, given the lasting impacts that itÃ¢Â€Â™s just had on one person, and then multiplying that by everyone, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not just about impacts on relationships, which directly impact your community, because in my mind, our communities are going to be what holds our revolutions. There is no good organizer in my mind thatÃ¢Â€Â™s also not doing community building, because theyÃ¢Â€Â™re so connected. Community is like the foundation that organizing gets built upon. A lot of thatÃ¢Â€Â™s misogyny and all thatpatriarchal mess that doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t getÃ¢Â€Â”community building doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t get recognized as real work but whatever. But given that, the child sexual abuse then becomes a strategic place to do work on, that then becomes a strategic generational place to do work on, because you can literally see how not just child sexual abuse, but intimate violence as well, but particularly child sexual abuse is passed down generation to generation. So strategically going for that hitting that mark, trying to intervene the cycle around child sexual abuse, which is often times the first place where people are being taught or learning about power and control, learning about oppression. We talk about it as the building blocks of oppression, and the building blocks of what normalizes violence later on, normalizes reproductive violence, [and] normalizes all kinds of other forms of violence. That is the first place where people are learning that consent doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t exist and that their voice does not matter, and [where people are] learning shame about their bodiesÃ¢Â€Â”all of these themes that reproductive justice really heavily hits on and should hit on in my opinion. Child sexual abuse is also a strategic place for organizing and for all of our movements, because itÃ¢Â€Â™s not just about this secret thing that gets hidden that happens in peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s home. The state uses child sexual abuse, whether itÃ¢Â€Â™s rape as a weapon of warÃ¢Â€Â”we know a lot of those rapes happen to children and young women who are not full-grown women yet, and to boys and to people who are not boys or women, who are intersex whatever. We know that the sex work and the sex trafficking that happens around the militarization, and we know the long history of Native American boarding schools and child sexual abuse being used as a tool for colonization, like all of these things. The State obviously doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t haveÃ¢Â€Â”if itÃ¢Â€Â™s using child sexual abuse, it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t have a vested interest in ending it. So I feel like my CSA work actually is a lot about reproductive justice and I bring a lot of my reproductive justice work with me, because I just think theyÃ¢Â€Â™re just so deeply tied, and thereÃ¢Â€Â™s no wayÃ¢Â€Â”itÃ¢Â€Â™s impossible to separate intimate violence, and particularly sexual violence, from reproductive justice anyways. But yeah, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the work that I do now and I feel like thatÃ¢Â€Â™s where my heart really is, because I havenÃ¢Â€Â™t come across a community where child sexual abuse doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people donÃ¢Â€Â™t talk about child sexual abuse. And yet I meet so many Asian women survivors of CSA all the time, who come up to me after IÃ¢Â€Â™ve spoken somewhere or after they read about my work. They donÃ¢Â€Â™t have anywhere to go. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s no services. Because even those larger services that we were talking about, in that survivor realm, I mean a lot of women of color donÃ¢Â€Â™t even access those services because of the silence and the added targeting that youÃ¢Â€Â™re putting your community at risk and your self at risk for, if you come out as a survivor. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s so many pieces to why I feel really passionate around my CSA work, and then the transformative justice piece of it, I feel is just exactly right on the money, because so many of our folks donÃ¢Â€Â™t report it and donÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â™ seek services because they are scared of what the state will do. They are scared of deportation, they are scare of people being harassed and beaten again or locked up and taken to prison, or because they canÃ¢Â€Â™t call the cops cause the last time the cops came to their house, they ended up raping them. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s so many things, so it feels like a really natural progression in my mind. I hope that it makes sense in other peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s minds.

CLERK: What organizations were you a part of? LABARBERA: I joined Ã¢Â€Â” they may have different names now but I was active in a number of organizations and those were Vox which is the pro-choice group, AWARE which was Activist Women Advocating for Rape Education so it was the anti-sexual violence group, Feminists of Smith Unite and a little bit, just kind of ancillary, involved with Prism which was the queer people of color group. And then I became the co-president, I guess co-president. I might have ended up kind of being the president of Vox and then was the secretary/executive board for AWARE my senior year.

CLERK: What was the feminist dialogue like during your time at Smith? LABARBERA: It was (pause) Ã¢Â€Â” so, in my junior and senior year we really built up, as far as the orgs go at least, a lot of collaboration among the different feminist-leaning organizations. Amongst ourselves we were pretty good. We tried very hard not to have events conflicting with each other. When there were really horrible anti-abortion bills it would be Vox and FSU [Feminists of Smith Unite!] working together to get letters signed and sent in to Congress. (coughs) Outside of it Ã¢Â€Â” I will say that I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t really have a whole lot of engagement outside of my circle of government or SWAG majors or minors. We were all mostly on pretty much the same page. It was challenging in that we were learning new things but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t necessarily challenging in that we were disagreeing about anything. Or we were challenging each otherÃ¢Â€Â™s ideas about it. It was always also Ã¢Â€Â” I will say I was always fairly queer-oriented and kind of progressively so even in just those two years. It was progressively more and more queer which probably is reflective of we were probably all getting a little bit queerer every day. It was also fairly, although not perfectly, intersectional and trying to lift up voices of people of color and lower-income students. That was something that we tried to do with varying levels of success as far as leadership of the orgs goes. There was one incident Ã¢Â€Â” and I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if this is really feminist dialogue Ã¢Â€Â” but my senior year we always put up the Clothesline Project around Seelye Lawn. That was the T-shirt project where survivors of sexual violence create a T-shirt and put whatever they want on it. If itÃ¢Â€Â™s a letter to their perpetrator or just a description of their feelings or an artistic whatever. And so that year we hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t put any out or put any in storage and I think we had 400 or so T-shirts. This was Spring of 2007. We were getting ready to put them up Ã¢Â€Â” or maybe we already put them up and there was, of course, this was the time of the Daily Jolt which was this horrible, anonymous online message board that was mostly an avenue for bullying. It was sometimes informative but primarily it was just mean messages because you could hide behind anonymity and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what people do. Somebody had posted this message that as Ã¢Â€Â” and by Ã¢Â€ÂœweÃ¢Â€Â I mean AWARE so AWARE was the organization that put up the Clothesline Project. They put up this post about Ã¢Â€Â” critiquing AWARE for putting the Clothesline Project up in the middle of campus because as a survivor it triggered them and they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to be triggered on the way to the library. They wished that we could have just put it away in a room somewhere. They werenÃ¢Â€Â™t saying that we shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t put it up at all but Ã¢Â€ÂœCanÃ¢Â€Â™t you put it somewhere more discreet?Ã¢Â€Â To us it felt very much like Ã¢Â€Â” and the idea behind the Clothesline Project is that whole notion of Ã¢Â€ÂœDonÃ¢Â€Â™t air your dirty laundry.Ã¢Â€Â DonÃ¢Â€Â™t talk about sexual violence in public because itÃ¢Â€Â™s not polite and it makes people uncomfortable. And so thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the whole point of the Clothesline Project is to be out and in public and to be visible. And so it was difficult to respond to because it was coming from a fellow survivor. There was compassion and we had done everything that we thought that we could do. We had a table that was always staffed right out in the Clothesline Project. We had counselors on-call at the medical center. We had set up a little safe space/decompressing space/processing space either in Seelye or the library. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember. So we had done everything that we thought we could do to support survivors in putting this thing up in public but it still created this huge backlash from this person and then from other non-survivors who also just didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to deal with the fact that sexual violence happens, who didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want it to be in such a public space. So as the Board of AWARE we wrote an editorial to the Sophian in response and also put something up on the Daily Jolt which was then just trolled again because thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what happens. But we did also send that to the Sophian and it was published in the newspaper. And then somebody also got upset because the Ã¢Â€Â” I think this might have been my junior year or my senior year. They blur together Ã¢Â€Â” but we had done a speak-out on one of the nights of Sexual Assault Awareness week and we had a speak-out on the steps of the campus center. We had amplified sounds. We had a little microphone bullhorn thing and people telling their stories. You could kind of hear it a little bit on the other side of Chapin lawn but for the most part you could only really hear it in that one space. And so we had gotten critiqued for that as well because somebody was, like, Ã¢Â€ÂœI was just on my way back home and there I was listening to somebodyÃ¢Â€Â™s rape story and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t ask for that.Ã¢Â€Â And I was, like, Ã¢Â€ÂœCool. None of us asked to be violated either.Ã¢Â€Â It created this weird schism of everybody trying to support survivors in different ways but clashing in really painful and really difficult ways. Somebody who was not a survivor who was trying to speak for all the survivors in her life wrote another editorial to the Sophian. It was basically a battle of editorials citing super antifeminist scholars about how we were inflating the statistics of sexual violence anyway and not that many people are really victims and survivors. Saying that we were exaggerating it and that we shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be so public about it basically. And that Spring Dorothy Allison, who is an incredible feminist writer, came to campus and we ended up talking to her about it and she read both of them and was totally on our side. But it was a really difficult conversation to navigate because as AWARE we were also really protective of what we were doing and really defensive of the ways that we were going about bringing light to this issue of sexual violence. I think this is one of the down sides of being on a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s college campus. People think that it just doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t happen here. The rates are lower, yes, but it does still happen and itÃ¢Â€Â™s not just UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amhers] kids coming over and committing sexual violence. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s people on campus, too. The feminist dialogue on campus became really contentious for a little bit. And then, as things happen at Smith, it blew over eventually within a week and people were talking about other things. That one week we spent a lot of hours in my friend CaraÃ¢Â€Â™s room in Park House just writing and rewriting and rewriting letters and public statements and things that we could say and do to try to mitigate what was happening.

Advice for students trying to create a safe space at Smith? IÃ¢Â€Â™d say (pause) just to find your people because I think that my safest space was with my people. My safest space that I ever found when I was on campus was when I was surrounded by the Smithies who are still my best friends ten years later. When I was surrounded by them and we were in the library or when we were in the campus center, when we were in somebodyÃ¢Â€Â™s room, that was it. I could feel really Ã¢Â€Â” if I was (unclear) on the way back on the bus and got harassed on the bus or whatever and I got back to Smith, I felt a little bit safer as soon as I stepped on campus but then I felt really safe as soon as I was in LaurenÃ¢Â€Â™s room in Emerson [House]. Or as soon as I was sitting down for dinner with somebody. Those people, those connections at Smith Ã¢Â€Â” thereÃ¢Â€Â™s plenty of things that an institution can do from the institutional administrative level to make a safe space.

 Tracy: I may be misunderstanding this, but did you deal with anyÃ¢Â€Â”it seems that sexual harassment policies came up during that time. Mahoney: [01:41:45] Well, certainly a big one came up. By and large, the schools were good about taking care of them, and I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember staff harassment issues, but by the time Amy Blue got over to business and finance, they 93 would have been paid attention to, but also I credit business and finance as paying attention to those issues, both before Bill Massy was business vice president, during, and after. So I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember those coming up, but I do remember the school issues and I remember that the key people in helping schools deal with them were Leah Kaplan, the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s ombudsperson, who was the wife, then widow of Henry Kaplan in radiology, and Alberta E. Siegel in the medical school, and also Eleanor Maccoby [Eleanor E Maccoby], who I think is still alive, living at Vi. So there was a network of people who paid attention in the schools, but sometimes you heardÃ¢Â€Â”I would hear from Alberta about stories that I took cognizance of but didnÃ¢Â€Â™t get involved in, a case of an infuriated human biology student who was going to have some kind of undergraduate research assistantship with somebody in the medical school, and he propositioned her in some fashion, which she rejected. And she was furious, and she went into that cafeteria in the Medical Center and, by happenstance, sat down next to a graduate studentÃ¢Â€Â”I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think a medical student, I think in one of the disciplines of medicine, of the medical school, and spouted about having been propositioned. And the women she was venting on said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, I know him. He did that to me too.Ã¢Â€Â And this young woman said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe will take care of this. We will go see my freshman advisor.Ã¢Â€Â And this graduate woman thought she was witless. Well, her freshman advisor was Don Kennedy. [Tracy laughs.] So they went over to Building 10, and the dean put together an investigation, and Alberta was involved in that investigation, which proved to be quite true, and 94 it needed in its outcome to go to the Advisory Board because any punitive reduction in pay or statusÃ¢Â€Â”and I think this was a reduction in pay, temporary reduction in payÃ¢Â€Â”has to go to the Advisory Board for vetting. Alberta said that people in the department, when she, at the deanÃ¢Â€Â™s behest, was doing this investigation, she said people said to her, Ã¢Â€ÂœThis canÃ¢Â€Â™t be true. He has such a nice wife and some nice kids.Ã¢Â€Â And Alberta said to me, Ã¢Â€ÂœThat is not what this is about. We donÃ¢Â€Â™t need to make this part of the family, but we need to take care of it.Ã¢Â€Â So my sense was that the issue was there, but the schools did a better job of it with the help of Kaplan and Siegel especially, and maybe others.

And when you talk to women students in science and engineering, usually pre-med and science and then engineers, they would have said in the past, Ã¢Â€ÂœI am thinking about studying engineering,Ã¢Â€Â or chemistry or biology. That group of women said, Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m an engineer.Ã¢Â€Â The grade thing was put into context because everybody out in the field thought they were useful, and the people who were not 98 professional engineers were quite certain they were engineers. And they talked about those experiences as being very useful. Gibbons took that to heart and he tried to do other things as well. He tried to get women into the faculty. But those were important things, more important from the point of view of things that I did than harassment. Now, my very last days at Stanford involved me in a sexual harassment policy issue, or sexual harassment charge, which Fran Conley mentions in her book. It was alleged by somebody in radiology which was known as a place where there were issues. Tracy: An aggressive atmosphere? Mahoney: [sentences deleted] There was some complaint made to the dean of medicine, say, in the middle of the week. That same complaint in all its detail appeared in the San Jose Mercury in the Sunday edition on Saturday, arguing, complaining about the harassment of women in radiology. This man [the department chair who was the focus of the allegation] was asked about it the next Friday night when he went to temple, and his kid was asked about it at school. It was terrible. So the dean put together a committee. The committee did an investigation. I was part of the committee. Alberta was part of the committee. There was a group of us. We had a court reporter in the room at all times. We interviewed every tech in the hospital that worked with the department. We worked with everybody in the department. We had something like sixty-three interviews. 99 I came away from that process absolutely convinced that everybody in the department was harassed and that it was an equal opportunity harassment. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t sexual. Women felt harassed especially when you combined their professional work with their family work, but men felt harassed. PhD men in the department felt harassed. It was a place of harassment. But we found no reason to think that this poor new chair of the department was the harasser. We did find reason to believe that there was somebody who didnÃ¢Â€Â™t like his coming who might have been the source of this, but we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t get into that, as our charge was merely to find what the story was. So that was my most exciting harassment story. I mean, sixty-three people and a court reporter whose salary just from us must have been in the six figures. They talked with medical terminology that I certainly didnÃ¢Â€Â™t understand. She would stop them and ask them if they meant this or that. She had a bachelorÃ¢Â€Â™s and a masterÃ¢Â€Â™s degree in some medical sciences field. But it was taken very seriously. So, no, I think sexual harassment claims have been seriously taken at Stanford.

Yes. I was working for Captain and&#8211;. EF: Captain Kangaroo? JR: Yeah, and I was watching one of my songs on the television. It was something about families or&#8211;. I don&#8217;t remember. Anyway, I was watching one of them, and I thought that was pretty good. And how many people watching that, I thought? Oh, six million. I think we had six million at the time, mostly adults &#8211; not mostly, but, a lot of adults. They liked Captain. I thought, &#8220;They&#8217;re watching my tune, and I&#8217;m trying to give them a moral lesson in my tune.&#8221; [This is the old commie coming out], the moral lesson. Well, anyway, it was about family, and I thought, &#8220;Oh; that&#8217;s nice.&#8221; Then the segment went off and the advertisements came on. So my segment went off, the six million are still watching, and the ads for: &#8220;Oh, get this toy! Get that toy, I have to have this and that and the other thing,&#8221; came on, and I thought, &#8220;Come on!&#8221; Everything I accomplished in my little three-minute segment is invalid in the next &#8211; because it&#8217;s not three minutes. The ads went on and on and on. So I thought: this is not accomplishing much. Then I went to the grocery store and I see these kids yelling at their parents, they want that sweet, they want that toy, and I thought, it completely invalidates the parent as a decision-maker, completely, and this is 1970, I guess. We&#8217;re not talking sex, we&#8217;re not talking violence. The relationship is skewed, and the child&#8217;s needs &#8211; and they&#8217;re not needs &#8211; are being&#8211;. The mother gives up and she gets whatever the kid wants. So I decided to go back to school, and I was going to go back and examine the effect of television on behavior. I went back, and it was about 1974, because then I discovered &#8211; here we go with the mass media again &#8211; I discovered in 1972 the Surgeon General&#8217;s Commission on Television Violence had completely clearly identified thousands of &#8211; I want to say three thousand&#8211; scientific studies &#8211; as if you needed scientific studies; you don&#8217;t need scientific studies &#8211; that the effects of television were disastrous. Children were becoming aggressive. Actually there was an increase in not only aggressivity but murder wherever, as the television came into the children&#8217;s lives, and yet that was not reported in the papers either. A Surgeon General&#8217;s Commission, 1972? It never saw headlines? Headlines should have been: &#8220;Television causes children to be violent. It increases rape by x percent.&#8221; It was all there, in 1972. As a matter of fact [Senator Proxmire, I remember, was] in charge of something about aggression, and he was interviewed and they had cameras interviewing him, and he was being interviewed and he was reporting on the Surgeon General&#8217;s Report because he cared about those things, and the cameras were on him. They never showed any of that footage, never. The only people that did, there was a Canadian television network, so it was on Canadian television. Oh, thank you very much. So that means that we&#8217;re heavy-duty controlled, you know? That means you&#8217;re shaping a nation exactly the way you want it. Who&#8217;s shaping them, and why, and what?

EF: Yeah, going from there and getting your PhD in communications, what motivated you to involve yourself in studying pornography and child sex abuse, in your early career? JR: First it was just pornography, because I didn&#8217;t know the connection with child abuse. So at first &#8211; I&#8217;m going to get a copy of this? EF: Mm hmm. JR: At first, after that experience, I started doing work in the area of pornography. As I said, my thesis advisor was an addict so he had no problem with me doing research on what he&#8217;s addicted to, except he didn&#8217;t say he was addicted but he kept his magazines in his drawer at the university. Okay. Anyway, so I did some experiments, which I didn&#8217;t realize were experiments. I shouldn&#8217;t have done them. We did EKGs. We had fourteen volunteers and we got a base run and they [gave] consent. Then we showed different images, and they were definitely resonating, but I thought at the time, like other people, that that would be okay. Well it wasn&#8217;t okay, not that they complained, but it wasn&#8217;t. We did a survey of a hundred and forty-seven women about what they thought, so the conflict was always there. They would always say, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t bother me,&#8221; basically, and then you ask them questions about their sense of self and the way men look at [them] and it was in complete contrast, complete contrast. So I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Wow; this is really not good, not good.&#8221; So then, the way it led to child sex abuse, I was at my desk one day and I was going to deliver a paper &#8211; we had done a paper &#8211; on the effects of pornography on women, because that&#8217;s what it was. So I got a hold of this engineering guy &#8211; he was addicted too &#8211; and I asked him, I said, &#8220;Can I have some of your Playboys? He said, &#8220;What do you want them for?&#8221; So I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to look at them. I just want to go through them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, which ones?&#8221; because he couldn&#8217;t let go of certain ones, even for&#8211;. [Laughs] He couldn&#8217;t tell how long I was going to need them. So anyway, I got his stack and I started going through them. Well, anyway, I started going through them and flipping them, and I thought, &#8220;Did I see a kid? Did I? No.&#8221; Then I go back and, &#8220;Yeah; that&#8217;s a kid. This is a child, and this is not a good picture.&#8221; Okay, it&#8217;s a cartoon but it&#8217;s not funny, and it&#8217;s abuse. Well I thought, "Okay, that&#8217;s one. Will there be more?" So I&#8217;m flipping and there&#8217;s another one, and I&#8217;m flipping, and another one. So then I went back and started to look at the totality of the magazine and realized that Playmate has &#8211; are children they have the little pictures of children, and I&#8211;. Whoa! This is not good. There&#8217;s going to be child sexual abuse here. This is not innocent. Then my daughter was raped by the boy upstairs, who was thirteen, at which point I realized later that laws had been changed to accommodate the fact that [if] a boy of thirteen abuses a girl of ten there&#8217;s a little peer exception rule so that they can rape kids. What is this about? So all this starts to add up, and my daughter, her reaction to this rape &#8211; it was over a year until I found out &#8211; was indicative of&#8211;. And the boy had stacks of Playboy. His father collected Playboy and they were up in his closet, stacks of it, but I&#8217;d never connected all these things. I mean I knew because I knew the mother and she mentioned it, and I thought at the time, "That&#8217;s silly. What man looks at that? My goodness!" But I never thought more than that about it. So then the connection is made between Playboy and the rapes, and it turns out that my daughter wasn&#8217;t the only one. It was the neighbor children, boys and girls. This kid was molesting them, and he was getting therapy, so the therapist wasn&#8217;t permitted to tell any of the neighbors or anybody, warn anybody that we had a predator in our midst, because there&#8217;s [doctor-patient] privilege. What is going on here? EF: And this is while you were in Cleveland? JR: [Pause] I don&#8217;t remember. No. I don&#8217;t remember. I can&#8217;t figure it out. EF: That&#8217;s okay. JR: Yeah, so I have that background. My daughter doesn&#8217;t want me to talk to anybody but I get permission to tell my friend, Carol. I call my friend Carol and I tell her. She&#8217;s in Berkeley. She&#8217;s as Berkeley as you can get. I tell her, &#8220;Carol, this is what happened to Jenny and I&#8217;m so upset,&#8221; and she says, &#8220;Judy, you don&#8217;t understand. Children are sexual from birth. She probably kind of wanted this experience,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;No, she didn&#8217;t. Thank you very much,&#8221; and I hung up. Then I called my aunt in Maryland, matriarch kind of lady, couldn&#8217;t be more different, and I tell her what happened and she says, &#8220;Well, Judy, you have to understand, children are sexual from birth. She was probably a little interested,&#8221; and so on. Now, I have been a communist-type and I know a party line when I hear a party line, and how you have a party line bridging those
kinds of areas, geographically and experientially and politically, there&#8217;s still agreement, the same? She writes about it now, Linda Bartlett. EF: Right. JR: It&#8217;s wonderful. EF: So, if I can ask, how did your daughter deal with that terrible experience and how did you, as a parent and as a researcher, also put it all together? JR: Well for a year, she didn&#8217;t deal with it well because we didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know. Once she said what happened, and in those years we didn&#8217;t know to call it rape, so I said, &#8220;Well you were seduced. You were seduced.&#8221; She said he had her shoes and she couldn&#8217;t go. It didn&#8217;t matter to her, I suppose. It&#8217;s okay, the words. I said, &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t your fault,&#8221; and so on. EF: Sure. JR: And I couldn&#8217;t do anything about him because the woman had sent him back to England. They apparently knew. They heard from the other kids so they got rid of the kid. So then, it took a little while, but she was okay after she told me and we told her father &#8211; I got permission &#8211; and he handled it okay: &#8220;It&#8217;s not your fault,&#8221; and so on. But I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if the brain aneurysm that she had, that she died from really, had something to do with that. EF: When was that? JR: Well, when she was twenty-one. EF: Oh, wow. JR: Yeah. She had a brain aneurysm. No proof or anything. But we know, or I have said, that the sex education kids are getting is a trauma. I mean it is a trauma. The way these children are being given sex information in the schools is affecting their brains in very dangerous ways. But, anyway. EF: Well can you tell me a bit about how you came to focus on Alfred Kinsey and what he represented and how your research wanted to counter that? JR: Yes. [Hugh] Hefner said he was reading Kinsey, he was a virgin in college and he was reading Kinsey, and he would be Kinsey&#8217;s pamphleteer. Yeah? Then I was delivering my paper on women and their reactions to pornography and so on at the British Psychological Association [conference on love and attraction], and Tom O&#8217;Carroll, a pedophile, who headed the Pedophile Information Exchange in England where they had a list of how you get kids, where you find them and all, was coming to our conference. I knew that a group of people at the conference were pedophiles, or just deviants and perverts, because they were on the Penthouse &#8220;Forum.&#8221; So it&#8217;s complicated. All the academicians there at this conference, except me, said that Tom O&#8217;Carroll, freedom of speech, he should come and he should speak about pedophilia as a viable exchange, and I said, &#8220;Heck no. [We were in Wales.] We&#8217;re guests of the people and we have no right to bring in a pedophile who advocates raping their kids, and then we leave and they&#8217;re left with that talk from an academic institution? No. Never.&#8221; So I was the only one who said that. Everybody else thought it was a freedom of speech, right, which says a lot about our academic sensibility, in my opinion. Anyway, so I was presenting my paper and a psychologist that was there came up to me and said, &#8220;If you really are concerned about child sexual abuse,&#8221; because that was in the Playboy, he says, &#8220;You have to look at Kinsey,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; I mean, I knew Kinsey, so I said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; So he said, &#8220;I worked with Kinsey and with Wardell Pomeroy. One is a pedophile and the other is a homosexual.&#8221; So I said, &#8220;Which is which?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Read and discover,&#8221; and he walked out of the room and walked out of my life. I can&#8217;t find him. So, I did. I read and I discovered. So that&#8217;s how the connection came between &#8211; and Kinsey was the man who said, &#8220;Children are sexual from birth.&#8221; Nobody had said that before him, and Playboy drew it in their cartoon. So the picture echoed the position of Kinsey, and that&#8217;s been disastrous for children. It&#8217;s been disastrous. Children are spiritual from birth. There&#8217;s nothing biblical that says that they&#8217;re sexual. There&#8217;s nothing that defines children as sexual at all, and skipping past biblically, if we&#8217;re talking anatomically and biologically, no. That&#8217;s not true. The churches have accepted it, a lot of them: we have to have sex education because children are sexual. What? There isn&#8217;t the slightest reason to believe that. They&#8217;re sexualized. They&#8217;re hyper-sexualized by our society, by the mass media, but left to their own lives, living, that&#8217;s not true at all, not at all. So that&#8217;s how I got involved. EF: So I guess you began your research somewhere in the 1970s, if I&#8217;m thinking of it correctly? JR: Mm hmm. EF: Okay. So can you describe a bit about your research methods and the studies that you produced about Kinsey? JR: Yeah. [Brief interruption] Well, first thing I did is I read. I read what he wrote, what he said, and it&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s in his two books. Chapter five shows a two-month-old baby being masturbated, or digitally manipulated &#8211; or maybe penetrated, because later on one of his colleagues said that they did involve penetration &#8211; for a certain amount of time in order to get an orgasm. Then he has a three-month-old, four-month-old, five-month-old, six-month-old, and he lists these little children, and that&#8217;s torture. That&#8217;s what they were doing to the little babies. Tables 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and what he called&#8211;. Then I looked. I said, okay. Alright. Okay, so these are what he said, that they did over &#8211; and the timing, how long it took to get the orgasm, and the time in between orgasms of the kids, and I said okay; what did he call an orgasm? I thought sure the guy would have not described it, but he did. Page 160 and 161. He said that there were one hundred and ninety-six children and he broke them up into six categories, six types &#8211; that&#8217;s what he called it, six types &#8211; one, two, three, four, five, six. That made it very scientific. It&#8217;s got numbers and everything, you see? Then he said that the children screamed, they cried, hysterical tears, and he put in parentheses, &#8220;Especially among the younger children.&#8221; What? What? Then he said, &#8220;And some strike the partner.&#8221; That&#8217;s the man who was raping them. Excuse me. &#8220;Strike the partner and try and get away.&#8221; Yeah? &#8220;But,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they definitely enjoy the experience because they often return to&#8211;,&#8221; and I thought, "Holy smokes! This is got to be a sadomasochistic&#8211;." Do you want to see the charts and all that? EF: Perhaps after the interview. JR: I said, "He has got to be a sadomasochistic pedophile." I mean, that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s got to be. There&#8217;s no human being who could describe babies writhing in pain and say that they enjoyed that as an orgasm but a sadomasochistic pedophile, so that means he was a pedophile. And this is the most quoted science in the world on sex? This is the science that we base sex education on, and this is the science that churches say children are sexual from birth based on? EF: So you produced some of your findings, and how was it received in the academic community over the 1970s and 1980s? JR: Well first, before I did that, I was supposed to research Kinsey and Playboy. The Department of Justice&#8211;. EF: Right. JR: Yeah. I was principal investigator. EF: At American University, or it was funded through there? JR: Yeah, American University. EF: This was in 1984, somewhere in that&#8211;? JR: Yeah. The trouble was the president was a pedophile. The trouble was&#8211;. EF: The president of American University? JR: Of American University, yeah, was a pedophile. The trouble was the head of the psych department was apparently a pedophile too. He was supposed to have [had] sex with a little nine-year-old girl in his trailer park at a nudist colony, Elliott McGinnies, so I had a lot of trouble at the university getting my research approved and so on. I don&#8217;t know how many others because birds of a feather flock together. You try to make sure that nobody&#8217;s going to squeal on you, that you have around you the right people, because otherwise somebody may tell. Somebody may report you or something. So I was supposed to do the research on Kinsey at American University. The Department of Justice &#8211; this was under Reagan, the last great chance anybody ever had to do any research &#8211; so then my grant hit all kinds of trouble. Well, I did know, but it turns out Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, they were all lobbying American University. They were going crazy because they thought I would find what I found. So they were threatening them, and the Kinsey Institute was threatening them, and I was sitting there in my office, trying to do my study. So then the Kinsey Institute threatened to sue them if American University let me do what I was going to do, so they cut out academic freedom, thank you very much. So they cut out any ability of me to research Kinsey&#8217;s work, which was ridiculous because I wasn&#8217;t experimenting. He was, but I wasn&#8217;t. I was going to look at the documents and try and find out where the children came from, because we had a lot of leads at that time. He&#8217;d gone into the orphanages and into the homes of the colored children &#8211; in those years &#8211; and so we were checking those out, but they cut our throats. They said, &#8220;No way. You&#8217;re not going to do that research.&#8221; EF: So American didn&#8217;t allow it? JR: Mm hmm. EF: They didn&#8217;t publish it? JR: No. They didn&#8217;t allow me to do the research. EF: Oh, I see. JR: The academic committee of respectable academics was the one that said, &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t do that. You can&#8217;t.&#8221; So, okay, but they let me do the Playboy stuff. EF: Okay. JR: You can look at Playboy. So I figured well; if that&#8217;s all we can do that&#8217;s all we can do. So we did the research on Playboy and found that they had been sexualizing children from 1954 and had engaged in what is now known as child pornography regularly. That seems important. The public needs to know that. Grandpa and Father weren&#8217;t looking at innocuous stuff. He thought he was looking at innocuous things but they weren&#8217;t innocuous because the way they work on the brain leaves no doubt that they work on the brain. They&#8217;re what we call &#8220;flashbulb memories,&#8221; that is everyone remembers that first nude that they saw, everyone, and they remember, in those days, because it&#8217;s not like now on the iPads and everything else, and they remember where they were and who they were with when they saw that sexy image. They remember everything and they remember the cartoons. They remember all the cartoons. How do I know that? Because of a lot of research I&#8217;ve done since, but the fellow who told me about Kinsey, who said go look at Kinsey? When I saw him earlier I said, &#8220;There are kids in Playboy,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;No, there aren&#8217;t,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yeah, there are,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;No, there aren&#8217;t.&#8221; He&#8217;s a psychologist and he knows. [I said,] &#8220;So you know Playboy?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Well, yeah, I&#8217;ve seen it, and there aren&#8217;t.&#8221; EF: How were you defining&#8211;? What constituted &#8220;children?&#8221; JR: Under eighteen. EF: Okay. JR: Under eighteen. EF: Did you do research to find out who&#8211;? Like some of them were cartoons, but for those that were photos did you look into who they were? JR: Yep. There&#8217;s a clear picture of Jodie Foster when she was fourteen, graphic, and Brooke Shields, graphic. Okay? Alright. And others. Mostly what Playboy did is they used out-cuts from [what they called] &#8220;Sex and Cinema.&#8221; They used out-cuts from foreign films or they used Hamilton&#8217;s ethereal images of coming-of-age, but they would have really rough&#8211;. Nowadays we call child pornography adults who are dressed to look like children, or peop
e who look like children who are designed with the hair bows and all that stuff, because now they realize it&#8217;s taken this amount of time, but they realize that that is just as precipitating as the real child. So, they had a lot of that, women dressed as children, looking like children. Alright. So, what was I saying? EF: Well, if I could ask a follow-up question to the research that you were conducting over the years, how did your research into Kinsey and pornography, how did that translate into your public activism, political activism? Was there a relationship there or were you more strictly in the academy? JR: Well the academy didn&#8217;t like me. [Laughs] EF: So as a result you were more in the public light? JR: Yeah. The academy didn&#8217;t want to produce my findings. The academy said, "We can&#8217;t do that. It&#8217;s not going to work." I went to a couple of conferences and then every time I sent in a paper, well, they didn&#8217;t have time. No. The academy didn&#8217;t like what I was finding one bit. It was not politically correct. So, I decided to get that information out as I could, yeah. EF: What were some of those different outlets? JR: Well, books. EF: Sure. JR: I wrote my books, Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, Soft Porn Plays Hardball, Sexual Sabotage, Kinsey, Crimes and Consequences. I wrote [all those] and I wrote articles. I went to conferences where I could; presented the information the best I could. But the academy shut it out, absolutely, and I was trying to understand that, and because I was trying to understand that I understood. I followed most of the people in the &#8211; let&#8217;s say with the power in the academy, quote &#8211; either were users of Playboy, Penthouse, or Hustler or something like that, or were connected with the Kinsey Institute. I mean it was all interconnected, and as I began to follow why are they doing this? What is this? It&#8217;s impossible that you don&#8217;t get that information about children to the public. I found that the Kinsey Institute was absolutely&#8211;. Oh yeah, they threatened people and they threatened to sue everybody who printed anything from me. They claimed that they had searched their files and it wasn&#8217;t true. Well they never did. They never did. It was not possible that they did. So, anybody who wanted to print anything from my stuff had that massive &#8211; with all their money &#8211; that massive institution to deal with and they were not willing to take that chance. Radio shows that were supposed to have me on were threatened and they dropped me. I was on Donahue because Donahue thought he could take me out. You know Donahue? EF: Yeah, Phil Donahue, the Phil Donahue Show? JR: Yeah, so he thought he could take me out, because he was very pro-Kinsey. He wrote a book with June Reinisch, who was at the time the president or the director [of the Kinsey Institute]. So he brought me on the program and he didn&#8217;t take me out at all. As a matter of fact everybody in the audience stood up, enraged, because he &#8211; that&#8217;s a good example &#8211; he did not want to put up the tables, out of Kinsey&#8217;s own book. I said, &#8220;Put up the tables, Phil. Put the tables up, Phil. Phil, put up the tables. Put up Table 34. Let the American public make their own decision.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t want to do it, and finally he put up Table 34. Well, that ended it. I mean everybody there was outraged. A five-month-old baby? A four-year-old boy, twenty-six orgasms in twenty-four hours? That&#8217;s an experiment. That&#8217;s an around-the-clock experiment. So the audience was completely on my side. He had a few, on the phone, shills that could call in at the end and say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe anything she says. The child is sexual from birth,&#8221; and everything, but the audience was absolutely outraged. So&#8211; EF: About what year was this? JR: &#8211;they would never let me on again. That was December, 1991. EF: Okay. JR: Yeah. There&#8217;s a transcript. I love it. EF: Okay. Well I&#8217;m curious to know more about the way in which you were in the public light, representing this research, and the way that you were active politically. So in what other sense or in what other ways were you acting as a conservative activist or a political activist in that sort of sense? JR: Well, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. I was trying to get the facts out to the people, and I was being blocked, and I fought it. Now the Kinsey Institute is in the UN. They are in the UN as a consultant for all nations on gender? There&#8217;s a website up now, stopkinsey.org, which has outstanding information. It&#8217;s wonderful. In Croatia we made a huge difference. EF: Just this last week? JR: Yeah, well this last week and then last year also. EF: Okay. JR: As a matter of fact they gutted the education minister, who&#8217;s given us all kinds of trouble, just this last week and they put in a human. They put in another education minister who&#8217;s pretty good, and they&#8217;re handing out my book as gifts to the teachers. I have to tell them they have to do it here. Yeah, so that&#8217;s going on. EF: Let me ask also, looking at some of your research and articles you&#8217;ve been writing the last several years &#8211; and longer than that, I suppose &#8211; I wondered if you could give your thoughts on&#8211;. It seems like you&#8217;ve written a lot also about gay and lesbian issues. JR: We were waiting for that, weren&#8217;t we? EF: Well I wonder if you could speak to how your research then translated into research in that? JR: Sure. It&#8217;s child abuse. There&#8217;s no transfer. There&#8217;s no transfer. The high rate of child abuse amongst what are called &#8220;gay and lesbian,&#8221; and what are called &#8220;transgender,&#8221; and what are called &#8220;queer,&#8221; and what are called all those other kinds of names is off the charts, except nobody wants to address that. I did my research using The Advocate. Do you know what The Advocate is? EF: I&#8217;ve heard of it. JR: It&#8217;s the mainstream. It&#8217;s the oldest and the mainstream homosexual magazine. EF: Okay. JR: You can&#8217;t get anything that&#8217;s more mainstream than The Advocate. I did research along with a statistician on The Advocate and they &#8211; admissions on their part &#8211; twenty-one percent of their readers, who are the basically white, upscale, urban, basically these are the guys, are sexually abused before age fifteen by adults. Now, they left out sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen. The sixteen and seventeen, those years, would be your biggest abuse populations. They didn&#8217;t count those and they didn&#8217;t count older kids as abusers. Okay? Alright. Even still, twenty-one percent are talking about they were sexually abused. What are you doing? You&#8217;re turning your back on twenty-one percent? Now, what they&#8217;ve done &#8211; and the same thing with lesbians. There was a Dutch [study], I think it was, and fifty-some percent of the kids were abused. What they do is the abused kids are mislabeled gay. What you do is you have an abused kid and instead of finding out who&#8217;s abused them and putting him in jail &#8211; you don&#8217;t see many abusers of gay kids put in jail unless they&#8217;re priests. Instead of getting the people who have violated them, the perpetrators, they say, "Oh, well, they&#8217;re gay. They&#8217;re gay." So that means they&#8217;re going to die earlier, they&#8217;re going to have all kinds of venereal diseases and everything else that they don&#8217;t need to have. Instead of protecting those children, instead of protecting those people, we&#8217;re labeling those people, labeling them. It may be politically acceptable today but it&#8217;s not going to help them. So, that&#8217;s my position. EF: Alright. Well really I just have a few more questions. I mean we&#8217;re here at Liberty University School of Law now and I wonder how you came here. JR: They were gracious and wonderful and said, "We will take your archive. You are welcome here." And I believe that if there&#8217;s any saving for our country it will only come through Christians who are able to stand up for themselves and assert their beliefs properly. Law, yeah; I ended up doing&#8211;. Okay, because then I needed to find out what happened to the laws, because my daughter didn&#8217;t want me to say anything, and when I looked she was right because of this peer, this little window&#8211;when you could sexually abuse a younger kid. So I thought, well, wait a minute. Has Kinsey changed our laws? At which point I started doing my research on the legal changes and yes; he changed our laws, radically, radically. EF: Did he himself lobby lawmakers&#8211; JR: Yeah, actually he did. EF: &#8211;in DC? JR: Yeah, yeah. He went all over. In Los Angeles they were about to tighten the laws on predators. He went to Los Angeles and he lied. He testified that children are not harmed by sexual abuse, that he had investigated thousands of children and [no, there&#8217;s no harm,] and so on and so on. As a matter of fact Kinsey acolytes, John Money and Fred Berlin, and another guy, Peterson, they advised the Catholic Church that pedophiles could be cured and could go back. So, that little tidbit was interesting. But the main thing was the laws on rape&#8211;. Estrich &#8211; that&#8217;s her name? I&#8217;ve forgotten her first name. She wrote an article in the Yale Law Review on rape, and she was Dukakis&#8217;s lawyer or something. She&#8217;s very popular and she wrote an article in the Yale Law Review on rape and she said, &#8220;What has happened to the rape laws?&#8221; She said, &#8220;With the conservatives we had tougher penalties for rape than we have with the liberals,&#8221; and she&#8217;s very liberal. She said the America Law Institute Model Penal Code&#8211;. Do you know anything about that? EF: Not really. JR: It&#8217;s the code that&#8217;s gone all over the country. The Model Penal Code supplanted&#8211;. You had the Common Law and you have now a belief in science, okay, which supplanted the Common Law. Science supplanted the Common Law. Well, what science? What science? Science on rape. What science on rape? What science on child abuse? What science on divorce? What science on sodomy? The Model Penal Code from 1955, and who do they cite in the Model Penal Code a hundred percent on sodomy and on rape? The Kinsey Institute, Alfred Kinsey. So, in 1948 half the states in the union had a penalty of death for rape &#8211; did you know that? &#8211; simple rape, not cutting off the arms, not a little kid, just a regular male-female kind of rape, the old fashioned kind. You know that&#8217;s changed. The kind of rape we deal with now has changed. It&#8217;s radically changed. But anyway, so, rape. Half the states offered the death penalty, the other half, life. You could get life for rape, and one of them you could get forty years. Okay. What does that tell you about the attitude, the relationship between women and men at that time? You believe the woman who said she was raped because virginity was a prized property of hers. She wouldn&#8217;t say she was raped and risk the fact that she was no longer a virgin. Kinsey came along and said: these women are all lying. They&#8217;re really promiscuous. They &#8211; fornication was against the law &#8211; they have engaged in fornication. But there&#8217;s no downside to anything. There was never a downside. He didn&#8217;t have a downside. He didn&#8217;t have abortion. He didn&#8217;t have venereal disease. He didn&#8217;t have child sexual abuse that wasn&#8217;t considered child sexual abuse. There was no downside to anything that he said we participated in. We were all promiscuous and it&#8217;s just that Grandpa and Grandma were hiding it. They were liars. Get it? So, that led me into an investigation of the laws. EF: Right. Well thanks for recounting that. The last question I have, and I&#8217;m asking this [in] all the interviews I&#8217;m doing the next few days, talking to conservative activists, and ideas of feminism, so what does feminism mean to you? JR: [Pause; laughs] Uh huh. EF: If anything. JR: [Laughs] EF: I&#8217;m not suggesting that it must. JR: Well, it means something. What does it mean to me? [Pause] It&#8217;s irrelevant. It&#8217;s just irrelevant. EF: Why so? JR: Women are reacting to their loss. They don&#8217;t know often that they&#8217;re reacting to their loss but they are. EF: Just to clarify, loss of what? JR: Of their womanhood, of their honor, of their integrity that they did have. There were problems pre-feminism. There were, you know. There were problems in the workplace, or there were problems in fair employment, other things that are not right, but now they&#8217;ve lost who they are as women. They&#8217;re treated like slabs of meat. This hook-up business: all part of the idea of feminism. [Sighs] And the rate of divorce, the rate of abortion, of venereal disease, all these things, they are examples of women who have come to believe frauds and who have given up their womanhood. They&#8217;ve given up their womanhood. We have a lot of women who are molesting children, women teachers molesting children. Something radical has happened to the character of our people, and this radical thing that has happened has happened to women. In my life &#8211; and it&#8217;s not imagination &#8211; women didn&#8217;t do those things. Somebody might, some weird gal might, but women, molesting children? When women start molesting children the last barrier of protection for them is gone. So, we&#8217;re in a very dangerous place. EF: Well thanks for all the information. Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to say or any questions that I should have asked that I didn&#8217;t? JR: [Sound indicating &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;] EF: [Laughs] I think I&#8217;m okay. I wanted to make sure there&#8217;s nothing else left unsaid. JR: There&#8217;s a lot left unsaid. EF: That&#8217;s always true. JR: Just a lot left unsaid. EF: Well thank you, Dr. Reisman, for your time. JR: You&#8217;re welcome...
