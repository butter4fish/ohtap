MADSEN: Yeah, right, right. Yeah, I remember that song. I don&#039;t remember the name of it now. REDMAN: Then there was also a tune of &quot;Don&#039;t be an Absentee,&quot; and then a &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; song. MADSEN: Yeah. What did you ask me?

MADSEN: Yeah, and a nice, pretty town. This building where we were was just two blocks below Shattuck Avenue off of University Avenue and about four or five stories high. We were up on the top floor. As you worked you could look all over the whole Bay Area. REDMAN: That must have been wonderful. MADSEN: It was beautiful, beautiful place to work. REDMAN: Then at the end of the war there, sorry in 1946-- MADSEN: That&#039;s when I was closing the installation. See, because how that started out, Remington Rand, as I said, opened this new
installation for the World Food Administration, and then after a certain time they brought in a man to run it, and he&#039;d had a lot of experience in tabulating. So Mr. Ferguson came in and ran the installation, but there was a turnover because these girls would come from all over the country following their boyfriends or their husband until they shipped out or whatever. REDMAN: So in particular, to places like the Oakland Army Base or Treasure Island, or-- MADSEN: Yeah, so either they would--the girls that wanted steady jobs as soon as something came up, because we knew this was just a wartime job, so the girls that were looking but knew they had to work, they would leave and Remington Rand would help them find permanent work. So there was this turnover. Then these other girls, sometimes their husbands would come home. Then they&#039;d leave, then move. So it was constant turnover, and so then when it got nearer the end of the war, in &#039;45 I guess, early &#039;45, or somewhere maybe late &#039;44, my boss said to me, he said, &quot;Why, I&#039;m going to look for another job. This is going to give out.&quot; So he said, &quot;I&#039;ll train you, and you take over for me when I go.&quot; So we did that, and I gradually moved up. I had a government rating of a four at that time, and this person, Personnel Director, he didn&#039;t want me to get that. He wanted me to go no more than a five rating in the government. One man started with a twelve rating--the man had started with a nine rating--and he wanted me to do it for a five rating. I said, &quot;No way.&quot; So we fought for it, and both of my big bosses fought for it for me. I finally wound up with a seven rating. REDMAN: So it was a clear instance of sexism where-- MADSEN: You got a lot of it in that place. That&#039;s where you got the, I&#039;d say, not sexual harassment, but harassment. This person would just bedevil me all the time. REDMAN: This was one individual in particular? MADSEN: Yeah, yeah. REDMAN: So they would make nasty comments-- MADSEN: Of course, there was all kinds of skullduggery going on with the girls that I worked with. Husbands, boyfriends, and what have you. REDMAN: So there might be more sexual harassment-- MADSEN: Right. REDMAN: More at that facility than at the shipyards or at-- MADSEN: I wasn&#039;t aware of it at the other two.

In other words, trying to drive the women out of the shipyards. REDMAN: Okay, okay. PURSLEY: Just a lot of rumors and, of course, a lot of sexism, a lot of remarks. REDMAN: Okay. I&#039;m curious about the sexist remarks in particular, and I wonder if was there anything that today we would call sexual harassment? PURSLEY: I think there was a lot of that, it wasn&#039;t against the law then. REDMAN: Yeah, so there weren&#039;t the strict laws in place at that point, so people would -- PURSLEY: Felt free to -- REDMAN: Felt free to kind of say whatever. PURSLEY: Right. REDMAN: Okay, and there weren&#039;t people who would maybe go out of their way to say, &quot;Hey, that&#039;s not appropriate,&quot; or &quot;That&#039;s not okay.&quot; At the same time it also isn&#039;t very gentlemanly right? So I&#039;m just kind of curious. PURSLEY: I don&#039;t recall anyone really objecting or saying, &quot;You shouldn&#039;t say that,&quot; but -- REDMAN: Okay, okay.

DUNHAM: Sometimes we&#039;ve heard stories, particularly--and you came in &#039;43, but even then--of men sometimes making it pretty difficult on the women, too. We don&#039;t necessarily call it harassment, from that period, but there were certainly stories of harassment or hazing or teasing and things of that nature. Did you experience any of that, or observe it? SAMSON: I never had that experience, and I don&#039;t think we really had a problem with that. Of course, I was only seventeen years old, so they treated me like their little sister or something a lot. But I never noticed anything with the other, the older; there were a lot of older women, wives, that their husband had gone on to the service and everything. I don&#039;t think the men there really resented us at all. There was a little difference, like [President] Obama&#039;s worried about now, in wages.

TIDMORE: There&#039;s still a lot of discrimination against the girls. And it&#039;s too bad. They&#039;re really good. Now they have to be as good as the men. And in most cases, I think--the ones that I know are. And they don&#039;t always get a fair shake. The make it up to colonel, like in the Marine Corps. But that&#039;s just about as far as they get. There are some generals; there are a few but not a lot. I just think that they have a hard time. And I know that the girls that are out in Iraq and Afghanistan, I know that there&#039;s a lot of sexual harassment, should we say? I guess that&#039;s what it&#039;s going to be. I don&#039;t know that they&#039;re ever going be able to change that. But I think the men nowadays respect the women that they&#039;re fighting with more in most cases, even though there is a lot of sexual harassment. I think that they probably respect them more than they did when I was in. They just didn&#039;t want women in. I mean it was too fast for them. DUNHAM: There&#039;s a certain nature, because of the environment you&#039;re in, where sexuality is bound to come up in ways. But in terms of the harassment do you think there are things the military can do to be more proactive in addressing it and then also in dealing with it after the fact? TIDMORE: I think they&#039;re starting to deal with it now after the fact. I think now they&#039;re really beginning to do a pretty good job of it. But I really don&#039;t know what there is that they can do. I just don&#039;t know what would make it easier, or less prevalent. DUNHAM: To me, when you have the top-down of the general during World War II in Quantico who was so intolerant, that filters down. To me, if they had more sensitivity training, or whatever you want to call it, but really to be proactive and have zero tolerance for that time of abuse and harassment, I&#039;m not sure they&#039;ve come near to that.

He said, &quot;They sent you on these trips so they could watch you walk!&quot; I expect that&#039;s true because the thing of it is there was no sexual harassment law back there, and you really could get yourself into trouble, you had to be really careful. The guys like to feel you up, get you in a corner, and-- REDMAN: Yeah, tell me a little bit about, did your appearance change from the time, because you mentioned that you were wearing the riveting overalls and the scarf for when you were doing that, but then when you transitioned into this messaging job, did you change your outfit?

So I am curious, that is really interesting when you told me that, so there was some, would you describe any of the relationships between the men and the women in the factory as having some hanky panky aspect to them, was there some of that as well? WIKELUND: Yes, there was a lot of that, but since I was newly married, I--but I have to tell you a lot of guys made passes at me and felt me up, and they just did, married men and older guys as well as young guys. And, of course, all the young guys tried to date me, and the married men felt me up, and not only me, but all the women.

WIKELUND: Okay, I did that for quite a while, several months, and then they needed a woman, a girl, and the guys all like me even though I was married, and I got a better job, and I became a liaison clerk then. I carried messages, I carried important, all kind of important, what do you call those--blueprints. REDMAN: Memos, or memorandum or-- WIKELUND: Yeah, I carried instructions and a whole bunch of stuff all around the plant. And you know, the guys would send me for funny things like sky hooks and all that. My boyfriend, man friend, not a boy, he&#039;s my age, Donald Baldwin, lives in America. He said, &quot;They sent you on these trips so they could watch you walk!&quot; I expect that&#039;s true because the thing of it is there was no sexual harassment law back there, and you really could get yourself into trouble, you had to be really careful. The guys like to feel you up, get you in a corner, and-- REDMAN: Yeah, tell me a little bit about, did your appearance change from the time, because you mentioned that you were wearing the riveting overalls and the scarf for when you were doing that, but then when you transitioned into this messaging job, did you change your outfit? WIKELUND: No, we had to be dressed that way. REDMAN: So you were still moving about the planes and the assembly lines with these instructions. WIKELUND: That&#039;s right. Then there were welders and all kinds of stuff like that, and you really had to be covered decently, none of the way the girls dress now. REDMAN: Right. So I am curious, that is really interesting when you told me that, so there was some, would you describe any of the relationships between the men and the women in the factory as having some hanky panky aspect to them, was there some of that as well? WIKELUND: Yes, there was a lot of that, but since I was newly married, I--but I have to tell you a lot of guys made passes at me and felt me up, and they just did, married men and older guys as well as young guys. And, of course, all the young guys tried to date me, and the married men felt me up, and not only me, but all the women. REDMAN: Now did that really bother people, or was it sort of, the women in particular, did that bother them, or did you get the feeling that that was something that was sort of laughed off at the time? WIKELUND: Well, it&#039;d depend on how graphic the feeling up got. You want to remember we women were just out of the home. The men weren&#039;t used to working around women then. They would pinch your bottom, then squeeze your breasts; they would get you in a corner and try to kiss you. I mean really they were ravenous beasts. REDMAN: Yeah. [laughter] WIKELUND: I mean you&#039;d never put up with it now. REDMAN: Would be considered grounds for being fired, of course. WIKELUND: That&#039;s right. Yeah.

Your students lead you the way. They are the ones, they saw some of the connections in race or disabilities, challenges, age and gender. Each one of those was sort of added as it grew into more of an issue for us. The gender and the race race came very closely after, but we were still calling it administrative strategies but I went back to Memphis and took, I don t know, about a three- or four-day workshop from Roosevelt Thomas. He had written the book Race and Gender that I had been using for the class, and it was an amazing time to spend with him, but I knew that I knew a lot more about race than I had thought I did. It 15 Nykolaiszyn Rhea Nykolaiszyn Rhea Nykolaiszyn Rhea confirmed that there were many, many connections there. And then ageism the different generations just integrated itself in, and that s how those things just happened. They just integrated themselves in. When we started out, sexual harassment was not an issue to begin with. It had always been an issue, but we hadn t talked about it, and then oh probably after the first session or two, we got into sexual harassment before it was out there in the mainstream. Were many colleges and universities integrating these types of courses? No, no, no, no, no. That s why I was asked to come and help put them together. I spoke at a lot of conferences and gave out all the information I had, sent them to places yeah no. I just had different support. I was so fortunate that I had somebody like Jay Boggs, and I had our dean, Robert Sandmeyer, and I had my department head early on, and my colleagues.

So I never have considered gender to be a handicap. In fact, I think that I got many, many, many opportunities. Many doors opened to me because the pool of women was small. It was easier for me because I wasn't a wife, I wasn't a mother, I didn't have to multitask. All of the things that make it very, very, very difficult for the youth today, I get it because I spend time mentoring them. I understand the problem of multitasking and trying to be all things for all people. [00:25:29] It was easier for me because I didn't have to do all those things. In a way, I could be very selfish. I didn't have to take care of anybody else but myself and then do what I wanted to do. What I wanted to do was succeed at Stanford. I didn't want to disappoint Henry Kaplan or Malcolm Bagshaw or Rich Hoppe or Dean Pizzo or whoever happened to be the person in leadership. So I never really saw gender as an issue. My friend Karen Fu, who was a trainee at the same time I was, reminded me of the day we came to Stanford. The room where the residents sat had lots of posters of Playboy pinups, posters of these braless calendar girls all over the walls. [00:26:26] I didn't remember, but Karen told me we walked into the residents' room said, "Take those down or we're going to put male nudes up on the wall." I said, "Karen, did we say that?" She said, "Yes we did, and they took them down." [laughter] So there probably was an environment of what today we'd call harassment or not a very nice way to act, but I don't remember it bothering me. [00:27:01] But my colleagues at Dartmouth, my friends, the girls in my class, talked about it all the time and still do, and they're asked to speak about it and write book chapters on it and speak to women's groups, etcetera. And they do. And I do, but I don't remember it being negative. Maybe I just don't put those things on my main menu. Maybe I just don't let them bother me. If they bothered me, I didn't put them in long-term memory. Gender has always been a card that's worked very, very well for me. I'm sure I've had opportunities I wouldn't have had otherwise because the pool of available women was very small.

CCM: Well, I actually had a good time, but I didn't retreat, which is what most of the women did, for--in some cases because they ended up with quite horrific family responsibilities that -- many of them did that from the very beginning. They felt very uncomfortable and very threatened by the male environment and the sexual attention. [You had a great deal of attention?] [35:00] from your male colleagues. DB: And those were the days before sexual harassment proceedings, etc., etc. CCM: Yes, but some of it...

Just an enormous bulge. The Yale faculty was never, I think, as large again as it was in '68, '69, or '68 to '70.

Certainly. When I was teaching in the areas of marketing and business, it was again, a male-dominated area. I think there were not role models in those days to say, Here s how you handle yourself as being the only female. I wasn t quite sure if the group went to coffee or somebody asked me to go to coffee, am I supposed to go? Does that mean it s a date? I worked through it. I was just trying to be as professional as possible but it was really awkward. When I decided I wanted to be a college professor. I needed the credentials to do that. I really needed the doctorate so I researched it. I 10 Nykolaiszyn Martin Nykolaiszyn found out that the best place in the nation to do this at the time was Ohio State. I was living in Arkansas. I had a three year old son and a former husband who told me that, Women don t do those things. So it was a real big dilemma to figure out how I am going to get this degree, if that s what I want to do for the rest of my life and how do I handle all this. It was a huge decision to go to Ohio State. I had planned to take my son with me while I did that, and then get my degree and come back. There was going to be one job in the state of Oklahoma that possibly would be available, that I might be able to qualify for. So I went based on that job being open and obviously it was and I did get the job. After I got there it was, again, a male dominated program. I thought, What am I doing here as a woman who left her family because she wanted to get this degree for the future? I did not know of any other women and that was what my ex-husband told me. He said, Name another woman who has done this. I could not come up with one, so I thought, This is really unusual. When I got the job as a college professor, I was the only female in the college of business. And it took me awhile to figure it out, but I was sexually harassed for a period of time, and I kept thinking, Something s wrong with me, I m causing that. For a while I just didn t know what was going on. I finally realized that s what it was. So I went and talked to the dean about it and he took care of it right away. But, it was a little painful to go through that because I respected the person and yet I thought it was me and didn t realize that there was more there. So, that was painful. I think sometimes just not having that female role model to say Yeah, somebody has done this before, and somebody has left their family to go do this. It s not, I m not abnormal, and to work through the sexual harassment. Then, once I came here and was in the CareerTech field, my former supervisor and mentor, Bruce Grey, took me under his wing. He took me to the superintendent s meeting and again, there would not be women there. But he treated me so professionally. Everybody else treated me professionally and it was very smooth and so I did not feel tremendous pressure for being a woman, necessarily. Nowadays the climate has changed It has changed, it has. There are those women out there and those administrators, and it is different. I was doing some research and I think something that you do here at Francis Tuttle that s really important to you is educating young girls and minorities about non-traditional career fields. Can you touch upon that for me please? 11 Martin Nykolaiszyn Martin Nykolaiszyn That s been one of my passions because, again, when I grew up you didn t go into a non-traditional field. From my vantage point, because I didn t know anyone who had these other positions but the teacher, the secretary or the nurse those were the jobs for women. And so I have felt really passionate about giving women opportunities for other positions because they can do any of those jobs. So some of our non-traditional programs for women would be, for example, the engineering program. I m very passionate about the number of women, they tell me there s about 25 percent, but I think there s less than that because, again, so many young women don t grow up with the female role model of an engineer. We started a program called GirlTech and each girl who is in one of these non-traditional areas is paired with a mentor who helps them through some of those tough times or gives them somebody to talk to. For example, the girls in pre-engineering will be paired with a female engineer and that gives them a huge opportunity to work through some of those challenges. In our automotive technician program, there s tremendous opportunities for women because they can be so skilled in those areas. But it s a tough, tough thing. Our society still does not look favorably, sometimes, upon women being automotive technicians or they, again, could be harassed. I try to encourage any of those women in those areas because they re great paying jobs. It gets them out of a financial hole and gives them a tremendous opportunity.

Tracy: Besides meeting women through lectures and talks at Clayman, were there other gathering points for women organizationally? Martin: [01:48:33] We had the female faculty caucus. As a result of first presenting the pay data, a lot of women called me to help them think through what they should do. I met a lot of women all over campus through that. Then I co-led the faculty caucus, and that brought other issues to the fore other than pay. Cecilia and I in particular took on Condi Rice (provost) on a number of those issues. We played the role of loyal to Stanford, but still in opposition on some issues. Then in the faculty senate, I was out there doing a lot of different things, not all to do with women. I got known. Then that got me elected. [01:49:32] I started getting elected to things like the Faculty Advisory Board. It just progressed. It wasn't solely, but it was heavily driven by getting to know women all over campus on the faculty. That was nice because I didn't know too many here in the Business School. We were so busy. [laughter] 64 There wasn't a lot of just social stuff. We did get together over dinner two or three times a year and it was mainly the Clayman Institute group. We'd get together for dinner and drinks and talk and stuff. We had a lot of one-on-one meetings. On an average week, I'd probably have lunch with other women two times, three times. [01:50:32] Sometimes a woman I didn't know needed advice on something, sometimes a woman who had been raped or harassed sexually, a faculty woman, and sometimes just a friend or a friend of a friend.

Tracy: Since you mentioned sexual harassment, in the mid 1990s, the sexual harassment policy went through some revisions. There were a lot of questions around liability and confidentiality. Do you have a memory of that policy being revised in the mid 1990s, or your sense of the problem? Because obviously you were hearing about--. Martin: [01:51:25] When I was the only woman faculty in the GSB--. If you were raped in the Business School -- student, faculty - -who would you come to on the faculty? So I did a lot of that kind of counseling then. The university ombudsman put complaints about certain faculty "in the drawer." There were complaints about some people over the years that were never acted on. The actual policy arguments were something I spoke up about in the faculty senate, but I wasn't a primary person on that. Tracy: Considering your position and being one of the only women, what was your sense of how prevalent sexual assault and sexual harassment were? Did you see a change in that over the years? 65 Martin: [01:52:34] When I came I was really visible because I was the only one in the Business School. People came to me from all over campus, freshmen even, in tears, "I was a virgin. I got raped." Over time, the university began to respond on the undergraduate level by having a widespread network of people who did that kind of counseling. I was very glad to get out of that business. At the doctoral and postdoctoral and the faculty level, the retaliation and repercussions of complaining are really career-sensitive, particularly if you came to Stanford to work with one person in a very narrow field, and that person's going to be writing your recommendations until the day he dies. Saying no to some of those people, they immediately would withdraw support from you. An offer to talk on a panel at a conference or contribute a chapter to a book suddenly disappears. It's a hint that you better find someone else to write your letter of recommendation. Whether you're going to actually take that complaint up through the university hierarchy when that person's been doing this for years and has always gotten away with it, that's a very tough decision for a victim, and I found it awkward. I don't want to talk about this much more because every time someone comes to you, you're supposed to report it to the administration. Some
of those cases, they would never have talked to me if they thought I would report it. They really needed to talk to somebody. I didn't have pat answers because those people are damned if they do and damned if they don't. We could talk more about what if this, and what if that, but like any good counselor, I wouldn't tell someone what to do in a situation like that. I've been actively involved in that. By the time the policy 66 came through I spoke up, and I spoke up in the senate, and I think it had an effect on some issues. Over time, the most important aspects of that policy did get revised, sometimes better, sometimes worse. I was just one of many at that point

 But anyway, that students themselves aren&#8217;t trapped in this same, quite such a limiting way of having to look and be.

There was no such--. I mean I didn&#8217;t have it. I didn&#8217;t think women are oppressed, women are a constituency with a certain set of needs and wrongs that need to be righted and all of that.

I mean if some guy tells them girls can&#8217;t do this or that and the other thing they don&#8217;t believe that at all. They&#8217;re the first to tell them that. They know that there&#8217;s something called sexual harassment and that it&#8217;s wrong and that it shouldn&#8217;t happen to them, and they want to have careers, and they think that nobody should discriminate against them if they become pregnant. They use the morning after pill, they don&#8217;t want to have children right away, they think that birth control--. I mean out on the far edges of should twelve-year-olds be able to get it without a prescription, you could have some argument, but in the main they definitely support birth control, family planning, abortion, whatever.

SK: That&#8217;s been really tough. There were a couple things that we had to work on in a variety of ways. One of them was language, okay, so that one&#8212;. Let&#8217;s see. We did that through the Commission for Women, so the Commission for Women in that case, we proposed some language guidelines and we got Chancellor Reese to agree to append them to the faculty handbook, because we wanted to have some place that we could point to and say you need to use gender neutral language. I&#8217;m coming to sexual harassment, but actually what you might think would be harder, we got that first that way. On the sexual harassment thing, I was on a committee of the AEP [Affirmative Employment Program] and we looked at policies at various schools and drafted one, and that&#8217;s probably dated in the 1980s, and again that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got and that&#8217;s become an issue. Okay, so at least we got something done, and it was that we were not successful, let&#8217;s say, in getting the administration to put one in but we could come in the back way and say we&#8217;re proposing this, so it&#8217;s coming from the side, if you will. Then you&#8217;d encounter all these people saying things like, &#8220;But that&#8217;s how I met my wife. That&#8217;s how I met my husband.

So Cheryl Travis and I have been talking about updating that policy because she&#8217;s been working on some stuff in the psychology department and I&#8217;ve been trying to get the AEP to retake it up as an issue, to update it and make it more powerful, because what it is, is it&#8217;s very weak. It&#8217;s a weak statement as it's written because that&#8217;s what we could get accepted, but ultimately you have to be strategically political. It&#8217;s better to have something that you can build on than have nothing. It doesn&#8217;t have enough clout in it, if you will. So, yeah, that&#8217;s one of our current projects, is to try and do that, and Cheryl [Travis] and I have published together on sexual harassment. It&#8217;s been a topic of interest. Certainly in the field of psychology it&#8217;s rampant. [Laughs] I mean in that professors exploiting graduate women has been talked about for decades and continues. JF: What was the resistance to a stronger sexual harassment policy? SK: Well it always starts from the kind of thing of sort of denying people the right to meet other people, as I said: That&#8217;s how I met my husband; that&#8217;s how I met my wife. That I think underneath it all is the idea of, you know, sort of like with rape, that there&#8217;d be false accusation, that there&#8217;d be misunderstandings. But overall institutions are not keen on dealing with sexual harassment, so I spent eight or nine years as the ombudsperson for students on campus and obviously encountered students who had various problems, and I discovered that the institution basically wants them to go away, okay. So they don&#8217;t want there to be action taken against somebody for sexual harassment; they want them to leave, or the student to leave, or whatever, okay, because that&#8217;s the whole problem with a lot of the policies that you have to sort of protect people, is that the institution&#8217;s really at heart trying to protect itself and so they&#8217;re not going to be supportive of things that would ever sort of make it public or lead to lawsuits or whatever. So, yeah, that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s not stronger policies. JF

So I think I kind of came by it naturally in some ways because even though it wasn&#8217;t talked a lot about when I was growing up my mother really did a lot as far as women&#8217;s issues locally and my practice has been based on or been centered around mostly race discrimination and gender discrimination, which includes sexual harassment.

Yes, about, I guess it was four years after I left office, some people came to me and asked me to run for county commissioner down here. We had 17 Finchum Collins Finchum Collins Finchum Collins Finchum Collins Finchum Collins Finchum Collins a problem with the commissioner in this area. And some of the gentlemen that were very involved from Norman came up and asked me if I would run. I really wasn t too eager to do that, either, but there was a reason I needed to do that. Now that was kind of a gender based issue. We had a little sexual harassment going on down there with our county commissioner and a lot of people really felt that a woman would be the answer. So when I found about twenty women asked me to run county employees I did choose to run and I did win. I was very surprised again. That was a hot and heavy race too. Although this area was pretty much evenly split, at least registration-wise. But there were two male candidates and I in the primary and there were four male candidates on the other side the democrat side.

 Again, I was raised in a traditional family. I was not raised with an awareness of issues related to women, but as I worked in a variety of environments, I could see inequities. I could see salary inequities. I could see workplace and environmental issues that impacted women in a negative way. In many ways I was fortunate to grow up in a time when those issues were coming to surface and I had the opportunity to work on those issues. Now mind you, not everyone was receptive to hearing about those issues. Not everyone was receptive to addressing those issues, but the inequities were real and sometimes are still real. It was important to try and raise the awareness and to surface those issues and to address them. Sexual harassment was one of them.

So the two things at once have really been important to me this year, about the kinds of issues that especially young women are facing&#8211;young people, but especially young women are facing&#8211;on college campuses. I just thought that was old history. [Laughs] SCB: To give the listeners some context, this spring, and last fall as well, several students have filed complaints against the university and now the university is in the process of revising its sexual assault policies to comply with Title IX and the Clery Act and other nondiscrimination policies, which leads me to another question. You&#8217;ve spent your adult life in a time when Title IX has been implemented, and you spoke just now about how it&#8217;s interesting to see how we&#8217;re still struggling with things that should have been over and done. Was Title IX a big event for you, having that in place? AC: Yeah, I was aware of it, but it didn&#8217;t seem like such a big event. It seemed like part of a larger flow of things, a larger, huge change that I felt was so obvious. So clearly I was aware of that but less aware of the kind of backlash that was happening, less aware of the way things were sliding in a different direction, because in particular I felt like we had won these battles. That is, women had won these battles in the &#8217;60s about not re-victimizing survivors of sexual assault. It seemed like we had taught judges and lawyers not to re-victimize survivors in the courtroom and we&#8217;d taught even newspapers and mass media these important lessons, and all of a sudden&#8211;. That&#8217;s why I was so shocked last spring to realize all around me, on a public college campus, these things that I thought were history were very current in terms of re-victimization, and re-victimization by the people I least expected, the university staff. So back to this question, Title IX&#8217;s forty years old, right, and the Clery Act is twenty years old, so it seemed like those broader kinds of shifts and broader kinds of education that had happened around sexual violence and about re-victimization, it seemed so sad and shocking to me that&#8211;. And apparently on lots and lots of public campuses and private campuses this is happening, this epidemic of rape culture is happening, and being permitted by administrators who&#8217;d rather sell their brand and keep things quiet rather than actually protect all students. I don&#8217;t know, it just kind of&#8211;. [Laughs] I&#8217;m still shocked about it. I still don&#8217;t have a way to make sense of all that, other than that I need to be more historical. [Laughs] I need to develop a better sense of how history changes and how&#8211;. I mean I know it&#8217;s this dialectical process and you have to keep pushing, I know that, but in another way I obviously don&#8217;t know that. I obviously can lose sight of that sometimes.

I mean that was another thing, another thing in the culture is that we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t talk about that. We got there, and we were, women, things were happening to us. This was like part of the beginning of that womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement and feminism and how many, how many men were getting away with the kinds of sexual harassment and nobody talked about it. And we were, we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t even have a word for it. We didnÃ¢Â€Â™t share it even among us our, but sometimes we did, but we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t even, we were sort of, we had a little bit of outrage but not even that much. My younger sister came down there. She was sixteen, and she got manhandled by someone in a position of authority there. And this is like, this is like child molesting as far as 25 IÃ¢Â€Â™m concerned. We didnÃ¢Â€Â™t call it that.

I finally did. I started out with skirts and blazers and that type of thing. I think about the ladies and they d dress all over the board sometimes. There are a few ladies who never wore anything but suits, and some are a little bit more casual. I won t tell you her name, but there was a representative who was elected, and she came up there and would wear a blazer, but she would wear these horribly, horribly derogatory t-shirts. They were derogatory against men. They were horrible, and she would come over to us and give us these cartoons that she had copied off 18 Finchum Coleman somewhere. They were horrible, and she would give those to us and say, These are just for us girls. And I m just thinking, Oh my gosh, and I m so dumb I never shared it with any of the guys. After the first year or the first legislative session, she learned because after that she started dressing very professionally. There are a few other people that noticed that, but it was very, very inappropriate. She finally started dressing very professionally and I realized, I need some suits. I ve been told the chamber is always cold. Oh, it s freezing and I would gripe like crazy about those fans and everything, trying to get them to turn the fans down, turn the heat up. In fact, I can even remember I don t know why I keep remembering Kevin Cox, but he went out to his car one time and got a blanket. It was horribly cold, and I guess it s to keep you awake some of the time. One thing I would like to say, just for posterity I guess it was difficult being a woman. It s difficult being a republican woman in the minority. One thing people need to understand is there were some guys out there that were horrible male chauvinists. I knew not to ever get near them and there was one guy I should have filed a sexual harassment suit against once because of his off-color teasing. I knew who I could tease with and who I couldn t, you know. I knew who I could come up and pat on the back and who I couldn t. But women are no different. I m not going to say names, but there was one legislator, she was young and to get what she wanted, she would go to the back of the chamber and hop up on the desk. She wore these real cute little short skirts and she knew what she was doing. She used her sexuality, you know. The men go about it a different way, but the women use their sexuality. I saw this particular representative several times embraced with men. I called it bear hugged, and she knew what she was doing. I thought, You don t need to do that. Then this other representative, she would file all these bills and we d kill them. Then she d come over to the guys and start rubbing her hands all over their backs and saying, If you d just let me bring the bill up for reconsideration if you ll just vote if you ll just give in to my let me bring it back up, and I ll take it back to committee, and she d just rub all over them, and of course they did it. She never did come up with decent bills, I didn t think. I d sit there and watch this going on, and I d go over and I d say, You are so pathetic you are so pathetic that you let her come over here and do this. She managed to get her stuff through. Most of the other women I don t think really did that. There s always a little bit of that feminine thing because we re women and we deal with things differently, but I remember those two. 19 Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman And then there are always rumors but it was difficult being a woman out there because you weren t in the in-group. Like I said at the beginning, I had to go and search out information because they weren t going to give it to me voluntarily. I think that s probably true of most of the women. We had to really fight. But for all those guys that were just horrible, there were some really good guys. I just thought the world of them and they understood that we were all equal out there. Since this is about women I think people need to know, that it goes both ways.

Gardner: Barbara Tannenbaum talking about how it was so important to her that a day like this was happening when she felt like she was always trying to deal with rape and harassment on campus, and people don't always listen or seem to notice and it's so important that women are getting together and showing how much this has to do with and how big this issue was even going on at the time. It was very important to them and they spoke first. And then, I can't remember exactly when the microphone started working, but pretty soon the microphone started working [Laughter]. And um we had someone holding an umbrella for the speaker a lot of the time, people switching off holding the umbrella for the speaker. Um, I wish I could remember who spoke first, but I was one of the first, maybe one of the twelve speakers. And I talked abo
t harassment I had gotten written on my door that year. I had a "Closets Are for Clothes" sign on my dorm room door, I was living in West Quad, I was a Woman Peer Counselor, and someone had written on it, "Rot in hell, you dyke and I'm going come back and rape you because I know you need to be satisfied, you smegma queen." Lamoree: Wow. Gardner: Yeah, that's the wording. I've said it enough times to remember it [Laughter]. And so that had been--that was a little while ago but, and it had happened during spring 8 Ã‚ break, and um I talked about how that was rather upsetting. And I remember there were some fraternity guys that when I was talking about lesbian/gay stuff kind of off to the right who like jeered, you know, which was really, you know, that but all those women there, it was like this complete juxtaposition right in front of me. So that went on. But as the first twelve people spoke, people started piling up, and uhÃ¢Â€Â¦ we expected it to last for an hour and it lasted until five or five-thirty. People justÃ¢Â€Â¦. And I stayed the whole time, I didn't necessarilyÃ¢Â€Â”I didn't plan to spend my afternoon there, and it was just this feeling of people realizing how huge this all was, you know, and Third World women talking about their experiences and how they were different, but related, and how sometimes they got delegitimized in the community because people were always, because racism needs to dealt with and so sometimes the sexism stuff kind of fell behind. And how theyÃ¢Â€Â”I mean, I want to make sure, you know, it wasn't like everyone was like, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe're all women, we're all the same,Ã¢Â€Â but it was like we've all experienced some violence and harassment in this society. Lamoree: There's a commonality in and amongst all of our diversity. Gardner: Yeah, yeah. So it just, it just went on and on. People were crying. People were realizing they had been raped and they hadn't ever realized that they had been raped. There were sorority women or women that were Wriston women realizing, "Hey, what you're saying relates to what happens to me." and you know, on and on and on for five hours

Unlike the other counseling programs, it's not just for freshmen or first year students. It's also for, um, some people live in upper-class dorms, and the outreach programs are targeted at least to try to reach more people than first year students. First year students are the best organized to do that kind of stuff for it and a lot of it still goes on with first year students units, but you know [inaudible]. And we deal, the training's incredible for it; there's an intense week right before school starts where we go through sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual violence, racism, lesbian/gay issues, sometimes eating concerns -- eating concerns is always included in some ways in the program, but I can't remember if it was in the training session. Lamoree: And the training sessions are run by Psych Services? 18 Ã‚ Gardner: Robin Rose is the organizer of the whole thing altogether, but like Barbara Tannenbaum who's like a big advocate for that stuff, I guess rape stuff [Laughter], is a theater arts professor, and she does that training. Toby Simon does just a general sexuality training, and she's in um, health education. Different--different arms of the university come together-- Lamoree: So they all come in?
