Messenger I worked in Chicago, when my husband was there. I worked to put food on the table. It was a good experience. Finchum Sure. You had to work because his salary wasn t that good? Messenger Had to. He was not a salaried person. He was a student. Finchum You worked while he finished school? Messenger Yes, University of Chicago, and even in those days it was a good school. Finchum It did snow a lot up there. Messenger The most snow I had ever seen. It was a good experience. I worked down in the Loop. Finchum Okay. Messenger Took me an hour to get to work at first. We had no idea how really big Chicago was. I took this job. I knew I could do it. It was for Commercial Credit. I had worked for Commercial Credit Company. They furnished loans on Chrysler products.

AUGUST: Lots of hanky panky. REDMAN: Okay, so there were a lot of people who were hooking up or meeting people, but you were engaged, so-- AUGUST: Oh, no. I didn&#039;t do any hanky panky. REDMAN: Right, but the men would hit on you anyway. AUGUST: Oh, yes. Oh, sure. REDMAN: Were they pretty forward and aggressive? AUGUST: Oh, yes. REDMAN: Can you tell me about what that was like? AUGUST: Well, I didn&#039;t like it. REDMAN: Okay, sure. So sometimes they&#039;d say some overly aggressive things that would be offensive and--? AUGUST: Right. I wasn&#039;t used to that. REDMAN: Okay, so that&#039;s not something that happened in the setting of high school in quite the same way. AUGUST: No. REDMAN: So this was a little less gentlemanly and a little more vulgar? AUGUST: Yes. REDMAN: Okay, so then would you sort of rebuff them by ignoring them, or--? AUGUST: Oh, I was very snappy. I snapped back at them. REDMAN: Okay, and you&#039;d tell them you were not interested. AUGUST: Yes. REDMAN: Now would that maybe end it most of the time, or were people pretty--? AUGUST: Oh, yes. REDMAN: Okay. So once people got the idea-- AUGUST: There was one guy who was an inspector, and he said he was a Russian Count, and he had papers to show that, and he kept bothering by me, so I said, I used a Russian word against him, prig, and he never bothered me again. REDMAN: What about other women&#039;s experiences with that? Can you, do you think other people went through a similar experience? Because there weren&#039;t the sexual harassment laws that we have today, so people-- AUGUST: Oh, I don&#039;t know. If you had an affair, you were quiet about it. Everybody knew, but you didn&#039;t discuss it, and you never reported somebody being aggressive toward you. REDMAN: Okay. So you-- AUGUST: Not until the last fifteen years-- REDMAN: Okay, sure. So you&#039;d just maybe snap back at them and-- AUGUST: You just accepted, yes.

MADSEN: Well, there weren&#039;t that many men around. REDMAN: There weren&#039;t that many. There was a song; it was popular in that day that was they&#039;re either all too old or too young. MADSEN: Yeah, right, right. Yeah, I remember that song. I don&#039;t remember the name of it now. REDMAN: Then there was also a tune of &quot;Don&#039;t be an Absentee,&quot; and then a &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; song. MADSEN: Yeah. What did you ask me? REDMAN: Oh, sorry, hanky panky, if there was--? MADSEN: I wasn&#039;t familiar with any of that. Maybe I was just being married and focused on what I was doing. REDMAN: So you didn&#039;t hear--? MADSEN: Oh, I&#039;m sure it was going on. But I wasn&#039;t, either of those places, I wasn&#039;t aware of it.

MADSEN: Yeah, and a nice, pretty town. This building where we were was just two blocks below Shattuck Avenue off of University Avenue and about four or five stories high. We were up on the top floor. As you worked you could look all over the whole Bay Area. REDMAN: That must have been wonderful. MADSEN: It was beautiful, beautiful place to work. REDMAN: Then at the end of the war there, sorry in 1946-- MADSEN: That&#039;s when I was closing the installation. See, because how that started out, Remington Rand, as I said, opened this new
installation for the World Food Administration, and then after a certain time they brought in a man to run it, and he&#039;d had a lot of experience in tabulating. So Mr. Ferguson came in and ran the installation, but there was a turnover because these girls would come from all over the country following their boyfriends or their husband until they shipped out or whatever. REDMAN: So in particular, to places like the Oakland Army Base or Treasure Island, or-- MADSEN: Yeah, so either they would--the girls that wanted steady jobs as soon as something came up, because we knew this was just a wartime job, so the girls that were looking but knew they had to work, they would leave and Remington Rand would help them find permanent work. So there was this turnover. Then these other girls, sometimes their husbands would come home. Then they&#039;d leave, then move. So it was constant turnover, and so then when it got nearer the end of the war, in &#039;45 I guess, early &#039;45, or somewhere maybe late &#039;44, my boss said to me, he said, &quot;Why, I&#039;m going to look for another job. This is going to give out.&quot; So he said, &quot;I&#039;ll train you, and you take over for me when I go.&quot; So we did that, and I gradually moved up. I had a government rating of a four at that time, and this person, Personnel Director, he didn&#039;t want me to get that. He wanted me to go no more than a five rating in the government. One man started with a twelve rating--the man had started with a nine rating--and he wanted me to do it for a five rating. I said, &quot;No way.&quot; So we fought for it, and both of my big bosses fought for it for me. I finally wound up with a seven rating. REDMAN: So it was a clear instance of sexism where-- MADSEN: You got a lot of it in that place. That&#039;s where you got the, I&#039;d say, not sexual harassment, but harassment. This person would just bedevil me all the time. REDMAN: This was one individual in particular? MADSEN: Yeah, yeah. REDMAN: So they would make nasty comments-- MADSEN: Of course, there was all kinds of skullduggery going on with the girls that I worked with. Husbands, boyfriends, and what have you. REDMAN: So there might be more sexual harassment-- MADSEN: Right. REDMAN: More at that facility than at the shipyards or at-- MADSEN: I wasn&#039;t aware of it at the other two.

PURSLEY: Well, there was a lot of resentment. There were all kinds of rumors starting about how women had been found dead in the double bottoms. In other words, trying to drive the women out of the shipyards. REDMAN: Okay, okay. PURSLEY: Just a lot of rumors and, of course, a lot of sexism, a lot of remarks. REDMAN: Okay. I&#039;m curious about the sexist remarks in particular, and I wonder if was there anything that today we would call sexual harassment? PURSLEY: I think there was a lot of that, it wasn&#039;t against the law then. REDMAN: Yeah, so there weren&#039;t the strict laws in place at that point, so people would -- PURSLEY: Felt free to -- REDMAN: Felt free to kind of say whatever. PURSLEY: Right. REDMAN: Okay, and there weren&#039;t people who would maybe go out of their way to say, &quot;Hey, that&#039;s not appropriate,&quot; or &quot;That&#039;s not okay.&quot; At the same time it also isn&#039;t very gentlemanly right? So I&#039;m just kind of curious. PURSLEY: I don&#039;t recall anyone really objecting or saying, &quot;You shouldn&#039;t say that,&quot; but -- REDMAN: Okay, okay. PURSLEY: It wasn&#039;t rampant, and certainly not where I&#039;d worked, and I worked other places, too.
