CCM: Yeah, and the first year I taught at Yale, there were no women undergraduates. DB: Oh, I forgot about that. (laughter) CCM: And there were no toilets, except in the Yale Library, for women. DB: Oh my goodness. 30 CCM: (laughter) DB: Oh my goodness. CCM: It was very strange. And I just Ã¢Â€Â“ DB: So how did you survive those seven years? CCM: Well, I actually had a good time, but I didn't retreat, which is what most of the women did, for--in some cases because they ended up with quite horrific family responsibilities that -- many of them did that from the very beginning. They felt very uncomfortable and very threatened by the male environment and the sexual attention. [You had a great deal of attention?] [35:00] from your male colleagues. DB: And those were the days before sexual harassment proceedings, etc., etc. CCM: Yes, but some of it... I mean, actually, these things are not difficult to manage, though I have been told recently, even by some of my active friends and colleagues, that it's probably being southern that made it easier for me. DB: (laughter) CCM: That southern women end up knowing more about dealing with men. Now, I don't think have a... First of all, southern belles certainly are supposed to be indirect and covert in getting what they want. I've never been successful with that. (laughter) CCM: I'm much more one of the boys on some level. I didn't want to hear the jokes. It used to make me very angry in high school when boys wanted to tell the dirty jokes, because I [36:00] couldn't [stand them?] saying anything that I couldn't hear as well. DB: Oh, goodness. (laughs) So the others [pulled back into some kind of shell?]? CCM: So the others just mostly pulled back into their shell and retreated the second year. The first year I was around, it was mostly just the Yale junior staff, which was a widely thriving 31 group of about 35 to 40 people, 10 of them hired in my year, and eight the next year, or something like that. Just an enormous bulge. The Yale faculty was never, I think, as large again as it was in '68, '69, or '68 to '70. The faculty always used that as their benchmark when they started talking about faculty cuts. DB: (laughs) Right. CCM: Everybody knows how to use statistics to their advantage. Or Ã¢Â€ÂœFind your best base here.Ã¢Â€Â DB: (laughs) Exactly. CCM: [37:00] But I don't know. I discovered that sometimes what I needed to do was try not to see somebody too much for a few days, just to, you know... But it really wasn't hard. I mean, nobody's going to rape you. And most of the time... I only once, actually, got sort of caught by surprise, much later than [my first few years?], and that was because I had simply -- I had never heard the rumor that this man (inaudible), and I thought he was asexual. DB: Ah, OK. Wouldn't have been someone you would've expected to approach you. CCM: No, and he was not very subtle at all. I found that one disturbing, particularly because he was [38:00] just [chaired?] (inaudible) committee on women. DB: Oh... CCM: (laughter) DB: OK. Interesting choice. CCM: Certainly. He was. He had, and has, extremely difficult relations with women students, because he tends to, as he puts it, "fall in love" with them and then... DB: That's not good. CCM: And then he has to (inaudible). I mean, there are some really very strange things that go on, but people who end up disciples are people who normally end up in really bad situations, have marched into (inaudible). Not always, though. I mean, there are instances... And there 32 certainly are instances of people abusing their power. And while there was a good deal of [39:00] sort of flirtatious behavior -- I guess that's what it is -- in many cases it's not really meant to be serious, and that's, I think, why a lot of women couldn't deal with it all. They could not distinguish what was not play, and not serious, or not serious unless you made certain kinds of responses. There might've been some invitation there, but you were certainly free -- DB: To not respond? CCM: --“ to keep it at a certain level, without it pushing past that level. And I will say, for my colleagues, with this one exception, that no single member of my department ever behaved badly. There might've been a couple who [had an idea?], but it didn't ever... DB: (laughter) OK, that's great.

Certainly. When I was teaching in the areas of marketing and business, it was again, a male-dominated area. I think there were not role models in those days to say, Here s how you handle yourself as being the only female. I wasn t quite sure if the group went to coffee or somebody asked me to go to coffee, am I supposed to go? Does that mean it s a date? I worked through it. I was just trying to be as professional as possible but it was really awkward. When I decided I wanted to be a college professor. I needed the credentials to do that. I really needed the doctorate so I researched it. I 10 Nykolaiszyn Martin Nykolaiszyn found out that the best place in the nation to do this at the time was Ohio State. I was living in Arkansas. I had a three year old son and a former husband who told me that, Women don t do those things. So it was a real big dilemma to figure out how I am going to get this degree, if that s what I want to do for the rest of my life and how do I handle all this. It was a huge decision to go to Ohio State. I had planned to take my son with me while I did that, and then get my degree and come back. There was going to be one job in the state of Oklahoma that possibly would be available, that I might be able to qualify for. So I went based on that job being open and obviously it was and I did get the job. After I got there it was, again, a male dominated program. I thought, What am I doing here as a woman who left her family because she wanted to get this degree for the future? I did not know of any other women and that was what my ex-husband told me. He said, Name another woman who has done this. I could not come up with one, so I thought, This is really unusual. When I got the job as a college professor, I was the only female in the college of business. And it took me awhile to figure it out, but I was sexually harassed for a period of time, and I kept thinking, Something s wrong with me, I m causing that. For a while I just didn t know what was going on. I finally realized that s what it was. So I went and talked to the dean about it and he took care of it right away. But, it was a little painful to go through that because I respected the person and yet I thought it was me and didn t realize that there was more there. So, that was painful. I think sometimes just not having that female role model to say Yeah, somebody has done this before, and somebody has left their family to go do this. It s not, I m not abnormal, and to work through the sexual harassment. Then, once I came here and was in the CareerTech field, my former supervisor and mentor, Bruce Grey, took me under his wing. He took me to the superintendent s meeting and again, there would not be women there. But he treated me so professionally. Everybody else treated me professionally and it was very smooth and so I did not feel tremendous pressure for being a woman, necessarily. Nowadays the climate has changed It has changed, it has. There are those women out there and those administrators, and it is different. I was doing some research and I think something that you do here at Francis Tuttle that s really important to you is educating young girls and minorities about non-traditional career fields. Can you touch upon that for me please? 11 Martin Nykolaiszyn Martin Nykolaiszyn That s been one of my passions because, again, when I grew up you didn t go into a non-traditional field. From my vantage point, because I didn t know anyone who had these other positions but the teacher, the secretary or the nurse those were the jobs for women. And so I have felt really passionate about giving women opportunities for other positions because they can do any of those jobs. So some of our non-traditional programs for women would be, for example, the engineering program. I m very passionate about the number of women, they tell me there s about 25 percent, but I think there s less than that because, again, so many young women don t grow up with the female role model of an engineer. We started a program called GirlTech and each girl who is in one of these non-traditional areas is paired with a mentor who helps them through some of those tough times or gives them somebody to talk to. For example, the girls in pre-engineering will be paired with a female engineer and that gives them a huge opportunity to work through some of those challenges. In our automotive technician program, there s tremendous opportunities for women because they can be so skilled in those areas. But it s a tough, tough thing. Our society still does not look favorably, sometimes, upon women being automotive technicians or they, again, could be harassed. I try to encourage any of those women in those areas because they re great paying jobs. It gets them out of a financial hole and gives them a tremendous opportunity.

Tracy: Besides meeting women through lectures and talks at Clayman, were there other gathering points for women organizationally? Martin: [01:48:33] We had the female faculty caucus. As a result of first presenting the pay data, a lot of women called me to help them think through what they should do. I met a lot of women all over campus through that. Then I co-led the faculty caucus, and that brought other issues to the fore other than pay. Cecilia and I in particular took on Condi Rice (provost) on a number of those issues. We played the role of loyal to Stanford, but still in opposition on some issues. Then in the faculty senate, I was out there doing a lot of different things, not all to do with women. I got known. Then that got me elected. [01:49:32] I started getting elected to things like the Faculty Advisory Board. It just progressed. It wasn't solely, but it was heavily driven by getting to know women all over campus on the faculty. That was nice because I didn't know too many here in the Business School. We were so busy. [laughter] 64 There wasn't a lot of just social stuff. We did get together over dinner two or three times a year and it was mainly the Clayman Institute group. We'd get together for dinner and drinks and talk and stuff. We had a lot of one-on-one meetings. On an average week, I'd probably have lunch with other women two times, three times. [01:50:32] Sometimes a woman I didn't know needed advice on something, sometimes a woman who had been raped or harassed sexually, a faculty woman, and sometimes just a friend or a friend of a friend.

Tracy: Since you mentioned sexual harassment, in the mid 1990s, the sexual harassment policy went through some revisions. There were a lot of questions around liability and confidentiality. Do you have a memory of that policy being revised in the mid 1990s, or your sense of the problem? Because obviously you were hearing about--. Martin: [01:51:25] When I was the only woman faculty in the GSB--. If you were raped in the Business School -- student, faculty - -who would you come to on the faculty? So I did a lot of that kind of counseling then. The university ombudsman put complaints about certain faculty "in the drawer." There were complaints about some people over the years that were never acted on. The actual policy arguments were something I spoke up about in the faculty senate, but I wasn't a primary person on that. Tracy: Considering your position and being one of the only women, what was your sense of how prevalent sexual assault and sexual harassment were? Did you see a change in that over the years? 65 Martin: [01:52:34] When I came I was really visible because I was the only one in the Business School. People came to me from all over campus, freshmen even, in tears, "I was a virgin. I got raped." Over time, the university began to respond on the undergraduate level by having a widespread network of people who did that kind of counseling. I was very glad to get out of that business. At the doctoral and postdoctoral and the faculty level, the retaliation and repercussions of complaining are really career-sensitive, particularly if you came to Stanford to work with one person in a very narrow field, and that person's going to be writing your recommendations until the day he dies. Saying no to some of those people, they immediately would withdraw support from you. An offer to talk on a panel at a conference or contribute a chapter to a book suddenly disappears. It's a hint that you better find someone else to write your letter of recommendation. Whether you're going to actually take that complaint up through the university hierarchy when that person's been doing this for years and has always gotten away with it, that's a very tough decision for a victim, and I found it awkward. I don't want to talk about this much more because every time someone comes to you, you're supposed to report it to the administration. Some
of those cases, they would never have talked to me if they thought I would report it. They really needed to talk to somebody. I didn't have pat answers because those people are damned if they do and damned if they don't. We could talk more about what if this, and what if that, but like any good counselor, I wouldn't tell someone what to do in a situation like that. I've been actively involved in that. By the time the policy 66 came through I spoke up, and I spoke up in the senate, and I think it had an effect on some issues. Over time, the most important aspects of that policy did get revised, sometimes better, sometimes worse. I was just one of many at that point

 But anyway, that students themselves aren&#8217;t trapped in this same, quite such a limiting way of having to look and be. Female students speak up, and they don&#8217;t even realize themselves, I don&#8217;t think, that they have a kind of consciousness that was literally not there in the &#8217;60s. There was no such--. I mean I didn&#8217;t have it. I didn&#8217;t think women are oppressed, women are a constituency with a certain set of needs and wrongs that need to be righted and all of that. They now think that. They&#8217;re not feminists, although a lot of them are not as afraid of saying that they&#8217;re feminists as the media would have you believe, but they&#8217;re not activists, I guess is what I would say, but they certainly have a feminist consciousness. I mean if some guy tells them girls can&#8217;t do this or that and the other thing they don&#8217;t believe that at all. They&#8217;re the first to tell them that. They know that there&#8217;s something called sexual harassment and that it&#8217;s wrong and that it shouldn&#8217;t happen to them, and they want to have careers, and they think that nobody should discriminate against them if they become pregnant. They use the morning after pill, they don&#8217;t want to have children right away, they think that birth control--. I mean out on the far edges of should twelve-year-olds be able to get it without a prescription, you could have some argument, but in the main they definitely support birth control, family planning, abortion, whatever. They think they should be treated equally and they have some understanding of what that means so they&#8217;re already like, here, whereas in the &#8217;60s--. I mean Judy started with me with a head full of junk, and as we organized--. I mean people needed to lose a lot of illusions, and the young women today don&#8217;t have anywhere near that many, the students that I encounter anyway don&#8217;t. They&#8217;re much more conscious, which is very good, very good.

SK: That&#8217;s been really tough. There were a couple things that we had to work on in a variety of ways. One of them was language, okay, so that one&#8212;. Let&#8217;s see. We did that through the Commission for Women, so the Commission for Women in that case, we proposed some language guidelines and we got Chancellor Reese to agree to append them to the faculty handbook, because we wanted to have some place that we could point to and say you need to use gender neutral language. I&#8217;m coming to sexual harassment, but actually what you might think would be harder, we got that first that way. On the sexual harassment thing, I was on a committee of the AEP [Affirmative Employment Program] and we looked at policies at various schools and drafted one, and that&#8217;s probably dated in the 1980s, and again that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got and that&#8217;s become an issue. Okay, so at least we got something done, and it was that we were not successful, let&#8217;s say, in getting the administration to put one in but we could come in the back way and say we&#8217;re proposing this, so it&#8217;s coming from the side, if you will. Then you&#8217;d encounter all these people saying things like, &#8220;But that&#8217;s how I met my wife. That&#8217;s how I met my husband. You&#8217;re denying us the opportunity.&#8221; [Laughs] Well just keep your pants zipped up and wait a little while. It&#8217;ll work. JF: [Laughs] SK: But you can&#8217;t say those things. So Cheryl Travis and I have been talking about updating that policy because she&#8217;s been working on some stuff in the psychology department and I&#8217;ve been trying to get the AEP to retake it up as an issue, to update it and make it more powerful, because what it is, is it&#8217;s very weak. It&#8217;s a weak statement as it's written because that&#8217;s what we could get accepted, but ultimately you have to be strategically political. It&#8217;s better to have something that you can build on than have nothing. It doesn&#8217;t have enough clout in it, if you will. So, yeah, that&#8217;s one of our current projects, is to try and do that, and Cheryl [Travis] and I have published together on sexual harassment. It&#8217;s been a topic of interest. Certainly in the field of psychology it&#8217;s rampant. [Laughs] I mean in that professors exploiting graduate women has been talked about for decades and continues. JF: What was the resistance to a stronger sexual harassment policy? SK: Well it always starts from the kind of thing of sort of denying people the right to meet other people, as I said: That&#8217;s how I met my husband; that&#8217;s how I met my wife. That I think underneath it all is the idea of, you know, sort of like with rape, that there&#8217;d be false accusation, that there&#8217;d be misunderstandings. But overall institutions are not keen on dealing with sexual harassment, so I spent eight or nine years as the ombudsperson for students on campus and obviously encountered students who had various problems, and I discovered that the institution basically wants them to go away, okay. So they don&#8217;t want there to be action taken against somebody for sexual harassment; they want them to leave, or the student to leave, or whatever, okay, because that&#8217;s the whole problem with a lot of the policies that you have to sort of protect people, is that the institution&#8217;s really at heart trying to protect itself and so they&#8217;re not going to be supportive of things that would ever sort of make it public or lead to lawsuits or whatever. So, yeah, that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s not stronger policies. JF

So I think I kind of came by it naturally in some ways because even though it wasn&#8217;t talked a lot about when I was growing up my mother really did a lot as far as women&#8217;s issues locally and my practice has been based on or been centered around mostly race discrimination and gender discrimination, which includes sexual harassment.

Yes, about, I guess it was four years after I left office, some people came to me and asked me to run for county commissioner down here. We had 17 Finchum Collins Finchum Collins Finchum Collins Finchum Collins Finchum Collins Finchum Collins a problem with the commissioner in this area. And some of the gentlemen that were very involved from Norman came up and asked me if I would run. I really wasn t too eager to do that, either, but there was a reason I needed to do that. Now that was kind of a gender based issue. We had a little sexual harassment going on down there with our county commissioner and a lot of people really felt that a woman would be the answer. So when I found about twenty women asked me to run county employees I did choose to run and I did win. I was very surprised again. That was a hot and heavy race too. Although this area was pretty much evenly split, at least registration-wise. But there were two male candidates and I in the primary and there were four male candidates on the other side the democrat side.
