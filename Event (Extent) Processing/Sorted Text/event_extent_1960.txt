Gardner: Barbara Tannenbaum talking about how it was so important to her that a day like this was happening when she felt like she was always trying to deal with rape and harassment on campus, and people don't always listen or seem to notice and it's so important that women are getting together and showing how much this has to do with and how big this issue was even going on at the time. It was very important to them and they spoke first. And then, I can't remember exactly when the microphone started working, but pretty soon the microphone started working [Laughter]. And um we had someone holding an umbrella for the speaker a lot of the time, people switching off holding the umbrella for the speaker. Um, I wish I could remember who spoke first, but I was one of the first, maybe one of the twelve speakers. And I talked abo
t harassment I had gotten written on my door that year. I had a "Closets Are for Clothes" sign on my dorm room door, I was living in West Quad, I was a Woman Peer Counselor, and someone had written on it, "Rot in hell, you dyke and I'm going come back and rape you because I know you need to be satisfied, you smegma queen." Lamoree: Wow. Gardner: Yeah, that's the wording. I've said it enough times to remember it [Laughter]. And so that had been--that was a little while ago but, and it had happened during spring 8 Ã‚ break, and um I talked about how that was rather upsetting. And I remember there were some fraternity guys that when I was talking about lesbian/gay stuff kind of off to the right who like jeered, you know, which was really, you know, that but all those women there, it was like this complete juxtaposition right in front of me. So that went on. But as the first twelve people spoke, people started piling up, and uhÃ¢Â€Â¦ we expected it to last for an hour and it lasted until five or five-thirty. People justÃ¢Â€Â¦. And I stayed the whole time, I didn't necessarilyÃ¢Â€Â”I didn't plan to spend my afternoon there, and it was just this feeling of people realizing how huge this all was, you know, and Third World women talking about their experiences and how they were different, but related, and how sometimes they got delegitimized in the community because people were always, because racism needs to dealt with and so sometimes the sexism stuff kind of fell behind. And how theyÃ¢Â€Â”I mean, I want to make sure, you know, it wasn't like everyone was like, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe're all women, we're all the same,Ã¢Â€Â but it was like we've all experienced some violence and harassment in this society. Lamoree: There's a commonality in and amongst all of our diversity. Gardner: Yeah, yeah. So it just, it just went on and on. People were crying. People were realizing they had been raped and they hadn't ever realized that they had been raped. There were sorority women or women that were Wriston women realizing, "Hey, what you're saying relates to what happens to me." and you know, on and on and on for five hours

Unlike the other counseling programs, it's not just for freshmen or first year students. It's also for, um, some people live in upper-class dorms, and the outreach programs are targeted at least to try to reach more people than first year students. First year students are the best organized to do that kind of stuff for it and a lot of it still goes on with first year students units, but you know [inaudible]. And we deal, the training's incredible for it; there's an intense week right before school starts where we go through sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual violence, racism, lesbian/gay issues, sometimes eating concerns -- eating concerns is always included in some ways in the program, but I can't remember if it was in the training session. Lamoree: And the training sessions are run by Psych Services? 18 Ã‚ Gardner: Robin Rose is the organizer of the whole thing altogether, but like Barbara Tannenbaum who's like a big advocate for that stuff, I guess rape stuff [Laughter], is a theater arts professor, and she does that training. Toby Simon does just a general sexuality training, and she's in um, health education. Different--different arms of the university come together-- Lamoree: So they all come in? Gardner: Yeah, and Beth Zwick now does the sexual harassment part of the training, which they're used to [?] at Sarah Doyle. You know, so the different people come to different trainings of peopleÃ¢Â€Â”of the, of the WPCs and also the we have instilled one-onone mock counseling sessions. The program is both one-on-one counseling in the dorms and also programming on different issues.

JH: Did, was there a place you could go with complaints like that, I mean for women? LM: Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, there was and Barbara Tannenbaum I think was part of that whole thing. There was like a sexual harassment task force or committee to go to. There was also a racial harassment committee to go to, Yeah, there was, and I think those started at that pointÃ¢Â€Â˜ there was a lot of, I think the rape crisis center started at, in that time.
