Ann Pitts Turner
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Jerry Gill
April 15, 2010 / May 13, 2010
Stillwater, Oklahoma
Gill

My name is Jerry Gill. Today is April 15, 2010. I’m visiting with Ann
Pitts Turner on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,
Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the
Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Ann, my first comment is
you’re really special to Oklahoma State University golf in many ways.
Just summarizing a few of those things, as first coach, you built the
[women’s golf] program from scratch over the next nearly quarter of a
century. You developed it into a nationally competitive and respected
program, won numerous major tournaments across the country, several
Big 8 and Big 12 conference championships, including a third place
finish at the NCAA championships, and I could go on. Congratulations
on your career. Ann, first what I would like to do is step back and ask
you where you grew up and about your family and some of these things.

Turner

I grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I attended elementary school, junior high
school, high school there. Went to Lanier Elementary, Woodrow Wilson
Junior High and Will Rogers High School. At that time there were two
major high schools in Tulsa: Central High, downtown, and Will Rogers
was almost new, on the outside of town. And then we had Webster,
which was on the west side of town almost, we thought, out of town, and
Booker T. Washington. Then I attended Oklahoma State University
starting in 1957 and graduated from Oklahoma State University in 1961.

Gill

Ann, can we back up just a minute, if you don’t mind, back to Tulsa?
Did you have brothers or sisters?

Turner

I have one brother, Bob Adams. He is seven years older than I am, and
he went to Will Rogers High School also and then Tulsa University and
then after the service over to Oklahoma State University.

Gill

Can you tell me about your father and what he did?

Turner

My father worked for Sinclair Oil Company for quite a long time, for as
long as I know. All of my life he was at Sinclair Oil Company. They
lived in Seminole, Oklahoma, in the oil fields early on, and I was born in
Shawnee, Oklahoma, and then moved to Tulsa when I was two. We
lived in Tulsa until they both passed away.

Gill

And your mother worked in the home?

Turner

Yes, she was a homemaker.

Gill

Growing up, were there some principles and values that you learned
from your family that contributed to your success later in life?

Turner

Well, in the fifties, when I grew up, everything was pretty structured for
kids. All the parents were on the same page. We all had the same rules
and all that kind of thing, and I think that kind of carried over for me
when I came to college. When I came to Oklahoma State University,
there were a lot of rules, hours in the dorms, you had to be in at a certain
hour, you couldn’t go out during the night, and it was all male and all
female dorms, etc. So, I grew up in a very structured time, and I think
then later on being married, I kept that structure with me a little bit, and I
kind of had to grow out of some of that structure that I was taught in the
fifties to get with it in the sixties and seventies. But, you know, honesty
and fairness, that type of thing I think was basically what all of us were
taught in the fifties. Get a good education. I know my mother didn’t
exactly promote me having a career. She always said, “You need to get
your education for insurance,” which was kind of interesting, just in case
I needed to work, because at that time most women were homemakers.

Gill

Well, Ann, if you don’t mind me saying so, I’ve known you for several
years and you are a very competitive person. Where did your
competitiveness come from? From your family?

Turner

You know, I think I was always competitive with my brother. We played
a lot outside. I’m sorry to say that’s not available for kids today, but we
just played a lot of games outside, and so my brother always let me play.
Those boys were seven years older than I was, and so I became quite a
tomboy when I was young, and until I went to junior high school I was a
real tomboy. Then when we went to junior high school you couldn’t
wear slacks to school, so you kind of had to become a girl. Anyway, I
think I just grew up being competitive because of the times that I spent
playing with my brother and his friends and then the neighborhood
friends. We had games. We just had a lot of games outside, and I was

5

competitive in them.
Gill

Did you participate in any sports? Were there any community school
activities for girls in sports?

Turner

No. When I grew up, there were no sports for girls or females, period.
We played some sports in gym class, but that was it. There weren’t any
extracurricular things for girls.

Gill

There weren’t any Y programs or summer league programs or
anything?

Turner

No. Now, I did a lot of swimming because the Red Cross always offered
free swimming lessons. So, I went clear through the Red Cross program
and became a WSI (water safety instructor) because that was something
that I could do and it was available. Mostly, the people that I grew up
with, we watched the boys play. We traveled and watched them play
football, and we watched them play baseball, and we watched them play
basketball, but we didn’t play any of those sports.

Gill

Other than sports activities, were there other school activities,
organizations that you were active with in high school?

Turner

I was very active in high school, but there weren’t any sports activities
that I was involved in. It was mostly pep club and trying to be a
cheerleader. You know, I tried out every year in high school and never
made it and then came to OSU and became a cheerleader, (Laughter)
which is kind of funny because I never gave up. I look back on that and I
think, “What kept me going? Why did I keep trying? Why didn’t I get
the hint that I wasn’t going to make it?” But I didn’t. I just kept trying.
So, that’s kind of my competitive—or I don’t know what that is.

Gill

Competitive persistence?

Turner

Yes. I don’t give up, I guess. You can tell me no, but I’ll try again.
(Laughs)

Gill

They have to find a different way to tell you no the next time.

Turner

But really there weren’t that many outside activities besides school
activities, you know, student council, stuff like that.

Gill

And you mentioned earlier that you enrolled in Oklahoma State
University. What year was that?

Turner

Nineteen fifty-seven. Fall of 1957 and I was a freshman.

6

Gill

What influenced you to enroll at Oklahoma State?

Turner

I don’t know. I just decided that I wanted to go to Oklahoma State
University and none of my friends did. All of my high school friends
went different places, and we were still very good friends, but we all
went to different schools and I didn’t follow anybody. I came over here
by myself.

Gill

How did you find out about OSU? Did you come over for a visit?

Turner

Well, at the time I had a boyfriend over here. My high school boyfriend
was in school over here, and so I wanted to come where he was. That
was one reason I wanted to come to OSU. Then my brother was over
here, and he and his wife—he was married at that time, so they were
here. I guess that’s why I came over here.

Gill

What were your first impressions of the Stillwater campus?

Turner

Oh, I loved it. It was huge and big and it was just exciting to be out on
my own, and I loved it.

Gill

Where did you live that first year?

Turner

Stout Hall. I loved it. It was super. That was the place to live.

Gill

What was your major at Oklahoma State?

Turner

Well, I started out majoring in business education. What they had at the
time was a two-year program called secretarial administration, and I
thought I was going to be a secretary, so I enrolled in secretarial
administration for two years. It’s kind of an associate degree. Well, then
I got married. I met a guy here and got married after my sophomore year
here, so then I changed my major to business education and continued
on and got a degree in business education, which they don’t offer that
anymore. All of the business machines and all of the things that I learned
to do are obsolete at this time.

Gill

That didn’t help your golf swing, anyway, right? (Laughs)

Turner

No. I wasn’t a golfer.

Gill

What were some other student activities that you were a part of as a
student?

Turner

Well, when I was a freshman I tried out for freshman cheerleader. There

7

were like 600 girls and boys. They chose one and I got it. Don’t ask me
how. (Laughs)
Gill

Wow.

Turner

So, I was a freshman cheerleader, and then I was a cheerleader my
sophomore year, and then I got married. You couldn’t be married and be
a cheerleader.

Gill

How exciting was that for you, Ann?

Turner

Oh, I loved it.

Gill

With all the rejection in high school and then out of several hundred
applications, you were picked.

Turner

Isn’t that something? I don’t know how that happened because, as I said,
I never was a high school cheerleader. I wanted to be, but I wasn’t ever
chosen.

Gill

Well, congratulations. (Laughter) Were there some faculty members that
you recall or administrators or dorm mothers or others?

Turner

Well, we had Dean of Women and that was Dean [Zelma] Patchin, and I
remember her. One of the instructors that I had for shorthand was
Labron Harris. I had him for shorthand and for transcription, and he was
fantastic. He wrote beautiful shorthand and I remember talking to him
later when I became golf coach. I told him, I said, “You know, I had you
for shorthand.” And he said, “Well, you must not have been one of the
better ones and you weren’t one of the worst ones because those are the
only ones I remember.” And he was right. I was right in the middle.

Gill

Did you compete in any intramural sports teams?

Turner

Yes, with the sorority, I competed on their team. That type of thing.

Gill

What sorority did you join?

Turner

I was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority here.

Gill

And what were some of the intramural sports that you recall?

Turner

Well, I remember we played basketball, three-on-three basketball, and I
had never played basketball and so this was exciting for me. I shot hoops
with my brother out in the backyard playing horse and stuff like that, but
I had never played basketball at all, so that was fun. And then I think we

8

played intramural football, but I can’t remember very much about that,
flag football. But I participated in as much as I could.
Gill

Now, I understand you were in synchronized swimming. Was that a
class, an intramural program, a team?

Turner

No, it was kind of a team type of thing that they had here. They had a
synchronized swimming team, and that just appealed to me because I
had done so much in swimming. And so I did compete in that, and I
competed in that even after I was married. That was fun. I enjoyed that.

Gill

Did you have competition with other teams outside of the university?

Turner

I remember I went to Norman one time to do something in synchronized
swimming, but we put on a performance here every year, a program.

Gill

At the old gym?

Turner

At the old gym, yes.

Gill

So synchronized swimming…

Turner

I know, people laugh about that, but you know that is not an easy thing
to do and I just loved it.

Gill

Didn’t it used to be an Olympic sport?

Turner

It is, still.

Gill

Still is? Well, it probably fits with your pattern of being very detailed
and very…

Turner

I guess. Structured, yes.

Gill

Probably fits right in there with that. I saw that on your resume.

Turner

I know. Everyone laughs when I say that. They laugh when I say that I
was a cheerleader and they laugh when I say I loved synchronized
swimming, but I loved doing both.

Gill

Well, Ann, you talked about you married Lynn Pitts after your
sophomore year?

Turner

Yes.

Gill

Where did you live?

9

Turner

We lived in married student housing on Sixth Street. Those were the
Quonset huts. They’re no longer there now. We paid fifty dollars a
month, all bills paid. (Laughter) We lived there for two years.

Gill

Looking back on your four years and your undergraduate experience,
were there any special times or special memories that you have? Any
highlights for you?

Turner

Being cheerleader, I loved that. That was so exciting to me to be chosen
as the freshman cheerleader. It was just kind of special because it was
one out of all, you know. They chose one female and one male and I
loved that, and I loved traveling and doing all that. That was a lot of fun
for me. I had never done anything like that. You know, when I got
married everybody was getting married in college at that time. That was
not unusual. Everybody was getting married, and so that was a fun time,
too, to be married and in school and really have no worries. My husband
was a football player, and that was fun to be included in some of the
athletics stuff there. I don’t remember very much more about it. I loved
my sorority life. I loved living in the house and doing that. I just lived
there one year because then I got married.

Gill

Because freshman year you had to live in dorms?

Turner

All freshmen had to live in the dorms.

Gill

So, after you graduated, can you share a little bit of information about
your life between the time you graduated and the time before you
became a golf coach?

Turner

At the time that we graduated…

Gill

Which was in…

Turner

Nineteen sixty-one. Military service was a requirement and my husband,
Lynn, had been in ROTC here at OSU for all of his four years, I guess.
I’m not sure how long he was here, but, anyway, when we graduated he
was sent to Fort Benning, Georgia. And that was very exciting because I
had never gone out of the state to live anywhere. So, we lived at Fort
Benning, Georgia, for one year and that’s where our first son was born.
Robert Real Pitts was born there. And then we came back after a year.
He was supposed to be there for six months, and because of the Berlin
Crisis he was extended six months, and so then we came back in like
July of ’62. So, came back to Stillwater to live here, and that’s where we
established ourselves was here. Then in 1965 my second son was born,
Bryan Linford Pitts. He was born here in Stillwater.

10

And then in about 1968 or ’69, and I don’t remember the dates on this,
Stillwater Country Club was formed by a group of people, and the only
other course they had was Lakeside Municipal. But, anyway, Stillwater
Country Club was formed and they were recruiting young couples to be
members. A lot of our friends were joining, and so we decided to join
and neither one of us had ever played golf. So, I took golf lessons and
Lynn took golf lessons and I took group lessons. And I think I took my
first group lesson from Don Sechrest who was the first pro at Stillwater
Country Club and who was the one that designed it, I believe. I kept
taking lessons. I just fell in love with the game. So, I kept taking lessons,
and Paul Hanks came and I kept taking lessons from him, and I
competed at everything they had at Stillwater Country Club. The
Women’s Association had a lot of events, and so I looked forward to
playing on Play Day with the women, and then we had a Friday
Foursome and we played every Friday. We thought we’d be doing that
for the rest of our lives, but, you know, things change and everybody
moves and it didn’t happen, but anyway, for that time I loved playing
golf.
And then in 1974 we moved from where we were living into a new
house, and my kids were getting older and they were in school, and I
was kind of bored and I thought, “You know, I think I’ll go back to
school just to see what it’s like, just to take some classes.” And, so, I
enrolled in graduate school in the HPER Department—Health, Physical
Education, Recreation.
Gill

So, you were a business undergraduate major now changing to P.E.
This is a pretty strong shift.

Turner

Yes.

Gill

Had your interests shifted in terms of where you wanted to go with
physical education, and did you have a career track in mind? Were you
thinking about teaching or coaching or what you wanted to do?

Turner

Oh no, no, no. I wasn’t thinking about doing anything except just going
back to school and seeing what it was like, but I thought I’d like to do
something in physical education and health. I was kind of into that era in
the seventies. It was kind of all about health and physical fitness and
getting in shape, you know, and that was always important to me. So, I
always liked to read Kenneth Cooper and their aerobics and all this type
of stuff, so I was really interested in health and physical education.

Gill

I’ve got to ask you one more question, and this is a tough question. How
good of a golfer were you? Did you pick it up pretty quickly? Were you

11

competitive?
Turner

Oh, no, no. I look back on it now and I just think, “I’ve come a long
way.” (Laughs) It’s much easier to learn when you’re young and not an
adult because children mimic very well, and so it’s easy for them to see
somebody do a golf swing and then they can just do it. But adults get too
technical and too frozen. So, it was very hard, but I loved it. I just loved
the game.

Gill

Did you win some of the tournaments?

Turner

Yes, I won some club championships eventually, but I look back and I
got beat severely by some people. I just look back and I laugh because I
thought, I probably could have beaten them later on, but at the time they
were just better than I. They had been playing longer and it takes awhile
in golf to…

Gill

Did you compete in any tournaments outside of Stillwater, like in the
state?

Turner

Oh yes. We went to state tournaments and we just thought that was so
much fun. A big group of us would go and it was so much fun. We just
loved it. I loved doing it, especially in that day and age. I wasn’t
working and so it was fun to get away from the family. I mean, it was a
vacation, you know?

Gill

I didn’t mean to interrupt. You were talking about physical education
and so you enrolled in a master’s program?

Turner

I started a master’s program. I took one class: health. (Laughter) I’ll
never forget it. I was scared to death. I think I was thirty-four years old
or thirty-five years old, and I just thought, “Oh my gosh. All these
people in here, what am I doing with these young people?” And I sat on
the very front row in the very front of the class. I look back on it, and in
my college days I remember older students that would come in, older
people that were coming back to school. They always sat in front. They
always paid attention, and all of us were just back there doodling and not
paying attention. But I loved it. I took that one class and it hooked me.

Gill

Where did your program go from there? Did you specialize in
something?

Turner

Well, I had to take some catch-up classes, [prerequisites] that were
necessary for me to get a physical education and health physical
education because I didn’t take it when I was in undergraduate school.
So, these are requirements that I had to take. I had to take all of the

12

sports. I remember I was in a P.E. class with Robert Turner. Remember
Robert Turner, the football player?
Gill

The running back, yes.

Turner

And he remembered that, too. I talked to him recently or saw him
somewhere and he remembered me because it was co-ed at the time, and
that was very new to have a co-ed P.E. class, and here I was this older
woman trying to play these sports with these people, but I loved it. So, I
had to take all of the sports: basketball, softball, track and all this type of
thing. I learned a lot in that and I got really hooked on it, and I started
thinking maybe I might want to do something with track, maybe at the
high school or something. Maybe help out at the track, and it just kind of
popped into my mind. Nothing big that I was going to pursue.
And then, two years into this, George Oberle, the Dean of the Health and
Physical Education Department, asked me if I would like to be the
women’s golf coach. I was just flabbergasted. I said, “Oh, I can’t do that.
I have no experience.” And so I went home and I was discussing it with
my husband, Lynn Pitts, at the time, and he said, “Sure you can do that.”
He really encouraged me. I owe a lot to him for encouraging me to do
this. So, I went back the next day and I said, “You know, I think I’d like
to do this,” and that’s how it began.

Gill

So, there was no interview process? There was no committee? Just
George asking you to do it. Can I back up and ask this question: Why
was OSU starting a golf program at this time?

Turner

Well, Title IX. Title IX came into existence in 1972 as part of the
education amendments. So, Title IX mandated that there could be no
discrimination in any federally-funded programs at any federally-funded
institutions, and athletics was one of them that hit the news. So, from
that day forward until just recently they’ve been fighting it ever since
because they don’t like it, but it has stood the [test of] time. So, in 1972
this was mandated, and I think by 1978 you had to be in compliance, and
so OSU was beginning to get into compliance with Title IX by offering
so many sports for women and funding them with scholarships, etc. So,
to be honest with you, I didn’t start the golf program at OSU. They had a
golf program at OSU that was a club sport, that wasn’t sponsored by
athletics or the HPER Department or anything. It was just a club sport.
Jackie Riggs Hutchinson, she was Jackie Riggs when she was here, had
the first golf team, and I think they maybe played one match. She kind of
kept it together and she taught golf in the HPER Department. And then
after she moved to Oklahoma City, Joyce Seward took over, and she
kept it going and it wasn’t much, but at least it was a group of young
women that were competing in golf. So, when I took over, there was a

13

group of young women here already that had been sort of what you
would call a golf team. They were so excited about having a real season.
Gill

Well, Ann, let me ask you, what motivated you to accept the position and
step up to this challenge? You were going to start it as an intercollegiate
competitive program and…

Turner

And I knew nothing.

Gill

Well, I’m sure you had experience, but it had to be a challenge. What
motivated you to step up and want to do that?

Turner

I don’t know. Probably the same thing that made me try out for
cheerleader. (Laughter) I just thought that maybe I could do it and learn
and, you know, Labron Harris was retired at that time and they did hire
him to be my assistant, and I learned so much from him.

Gill

Labron was your assistant?

Turner

Yes. (Laughter) Isn’t that fun? And he helped those girls and they just
loved him, so it was wonderful. I had a wonderful start, but I didn’t
know anything about coaching. I had never been a coach in my life. I
didn’t know anything about collegiate golf. I didn’t know how many
people were on a team or how they scored. I had no clue, so I learned it
all that very first year. Well, not all of it. I’m going to say I didn’t learn
all that I knew that very first year, but I learned about collegiate golf that
first year.

Gill

Can we step back for just a minute? I want to pick up on your comments
earlier. I want to get back into your golf program in just a little bit, but
can we talk about, as you said, in the early to mid-seventies and the
early eighties was a transformational period for women’s intercollegiate
athletics, to say the least. You talked about Title IX driving the change.
How did it impact OSU? And I want to come back to the question at
OSU right now. So, adding sports is one of those things they did,
including golf, so how was it impacting OSU at this time in the midseventies?

Turner

Well, there were scholarships offered which had not been offered before.
There was funding for travel for a real season, not just one match here
and there, but a real season. And I think that’s basically it. It was more—
it wasn’t a club sport anymore. It was really going to be supported by the
HPER Department. Now we were in the HPER Department, so this was
supported and controlled in the Health and Physical Education
Department. That’s where it was. We didn’t move into the athletic
department until 1980.

14

Gill

So, when you came in, right before they started making this change, and
you’re saying sports were under the Health and Physical Education
Recreation Department. Previous to that point, had they been more club
sports in nature?

Turner

Yes, club sports. Just like there’s a lot of club sports here at OSU today.

Gill

And they would play maybe some other schools in the Oklahoma area
occasionally?

Turner

Maybe.

Gill

Some just here on campus?

Turner

Yes.

Gill

So, it was under HPER when you started. You talked about scholarships
now and travel. Where did the money come from, the funding?

Turner

Well, from the university, I guess, because it came through the HPER
department. I do want to say one thing. I started coaching in the fall of
’76. In the spring of 1977, we won our first Big 8 Championship.

Gill

Wow.

Turner

And that is due largely to Labron Harris. I want to make sure that that’s
known because other schools—Oklahoma had started before us.
University of Oklahoma had started their golf team before us. Tulsa
University had started their team before us. They had Nancy Lopez, so
they had really put it on the map. They put Oklahoma on the map. We
were behind.

Gill

How many years did Labron work with you?

Turner

I’m going to say that I don’t know exactly. I can’t tell you exactly, but
maybe five?

Gill

What a tremendous asset. What was the organizational structure for
women’s athletics at this time when you came in ’76? You said it was
the HPER Department that organized it. Who oversaw the women’s
program?

Turner

I don’t remember exactly when I first started. George Oberle was the
head of it, but then Betty Abercrombie, I believe, became the women’s
athletic director for us at the time, and then soon after that they hired

15

somebody to be the athletic director that was a coach there, and then we
hired somebody from the outside to be athletic director. What I
remember is Susan Hall. We hired Susan Hall to be our athletic director
and that was all before we moved to the athletic department.
Gill

Can you tell me a little bit about what would have been a typical budget
for one of the programs at this time?

Turner

Well, my salary was $200 a month for ten months.

Gill

Not $2,000 a month.

Turner

Two-hundred dollars for ten months. That’s $2,000 for the year. One of
the things I knew was that we had to fundraise. The very first thing I did
was talk to Mr. Iba and Doyne Iba, his wife. Doyne Iba was a successful
golfer and I knew her very well, and so I went and talked with them and
he said, “You’re going to have to have more money.” And so I started
fundraising from almost the day that I got the job because I knew we had
to have more money if we wanted to compete like University of Tulsa
and University of Oklahoma were doing and travel. And so I started
fundraising. I can’t remember what our budget was, to tell you the truth.
I have no recollection. I know we stayed within it, (Laughter) and I
know we got new golf bags and everybody had matching bags and
matching uniforms, and they were just so excited. I mean, these young
women were so excited to have a full-fledged program presented to
them.

Gill

What was the working relationship? You had women’s sports in HPER
and men’s sports in intercollegiate athletics. During that period, that
transition when you went over, merging with the men’s program, what
was the relationship between the two programs?

Turner

Well, there was no relationship really. We saw them when we practiced
because we practiced at Lakeside. That’s where we could practice. We
didn’t have Stillwater Country Club memberships for maybe two or
three years. We couldn’t go out there. We couldn’t afford it. Now the
men had memberships out there, so there was a big difference in what
the men and women could do, but, you know, we did what we could do.
And also, I have failed to mention, women’s sports at this time were
governed nationally by AIAW, Association of Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women. Donna Lopiano, who was at the University of Texas as AD
[athletic director] and went on to be executive director of Women’s
Sports Foundation and then on to something else since then, was the
director of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. Oh, I
learned so much from her. We really tried to keep our own organization,
but the NCAA convinced all of the athletic directors that we should all

16

merge with great promises that everything would be better.
Gill

I want to get to those promises in just a little bit. I see you smiling.
(Laughs) Facilities when you first started, not just in golf, but for
women’s sports, I guess some was over in the Colvin Center, some here
and there in the intramural fields. Was there competition for facilities
amongst the club sports programs that were now emerging and
intramural programs in the athletics department? Was there a
competition there for getting playing time for facilities?

Turner

I don’t know. I don’t know about that. We were at Lakeside so that’s
where we did our playing. I don’t even remember how I worked that out
where we practiced and played and had qualifying out there. I don’t
remember, Jerry. That’s terrible, but I don’t really remember how that
worked out. We had a lot of sports. There were a lot of women’s sports.

Gill

Can you remember some of those? Can you go over which sports…

Turner

Yes. Swimming and diving, softball, field hockey, volleyball, basketball,
track, all of the track, three of them. They count as three. Golf. Tennis.

Gill

Was gymnastics offered?

Turner

Gymnastics, yes. Yes, we had gymnastics. All of us were there in the
HPER Department, so we saw each other every day. A lot of us were
graduate students. I had a little desk there.

Gill

Who were some of the coaches you remember in women’s sports at that
time? Any stories that you want to tell?

Turner

Larry Bilhartz was the gymnastics coach, and he and his wife, I
remember them very well. Had a good gymnastics program. Jacy
Showers, I think Jacy Showers was the basketball coach, and I also had
her for an instructor. So, not only was she coaching, but she was
teaching me in some of these classes I was taking because I had to take
basketball and softball and all of these sports to play.

Gill

Is that common for a coach to teach their class? For example, did you
ever teach golf?

Turner

No, but at the time a lot of the coaches were teaching because they were
in the HPER Department, so they were instructors and coaches. It was
different than today. (Laughs)

Gill

Their salary for teaching was probably as much as it was coaching.

17

Turner

And they probably made more teaching than for coaching.

Gill

Ann, you talked about the AIAW. As I understand, you were active in the
association.

Turner

Yes.

Gill

Could we talk about the guiding principles and then maybe get to how it
changed as it went into the NCAA? What were the guiding principles
and the founding principles of AIAW?

Turner

The founding principles were to provide intercollegiate competition for
women’s sports and have it governed by an organization that had rules
for recruiting and competition and had championships and this type of
thing. It paralleled the NCAA.

Gill

How was it similar, in your thinking, or different from the NCAA
guidelines? You went under the NCAA a few years later, and we’ll get to
that, but was there a difference in philosophy between the two
organizations?

Turner

Well, I think at the time that I started coaching it was 90 percent female
coaches, and that’s how it started. It started in the physical education
departments to begin with. In 1941 was the first intercollegiate women’s
tournament, and it was started by Gladys Palmer, who was a physical
education instructor at Minnesota, and Patty Berg was her prime student
and she wanted to have a competition for her.

Gill

Would that have been true in the early period, that most of the
administrators, most of the leadership, in AIAW would come out of a
P.E. background?

Turner

Yes, as a coach or as a teacher in that era.

Gill

Did that perspective affect or impact how they thought about sports so
that they looked more at education, not as much the competitive side of
it, more of an amateur, if you will, student athlete perspective?

Turner

Oh yes, I think so. I think that it was, definitely. All of the players were
very appreciative of anything they got to do because they had never got
to do much before, and they kept it that way and they wanted to govern
themselves. And this was the thing. Women wanted to govern women’s
sports. That doesn’t mean that a male couldn’t be in the administration
of governing, but we wanted to govern ourselves. Well, this didn’t hold
up.

18

Gill

In 1979 here in Stillwater, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University hosted
the AIAW National Golf Championship at Stillwater Country Club,
1979. That’s two years after I started coaching. (Laughter)
Now you were on the golf committee?

Turner

Yes, I became a member of the golf committee, and they were looking
for a place to have it and I said, “We’ll have it!” (Laughter) Not really
knowing what I was doing, but I’m really glad we did that.

Gill

Was that a good experience for you?

Turner

Oh yeah. It was a great experience, and I thought it would be a good
experience for the people of Stillwater to see women’s golf. You know,
it was so brand new to everybody. Everybody knew about Labron
Harris’ success, and then Mike Holder took over from him. Everybody
knew about that, but nobody knew about women’s golf and they were
able to witness some very fine women’s golf. Some Hall of Famers
played here.

Gill

Do you remember some of them?

Turner

Yes. Juli Inkster played here. Patty Sheehan played here. Pia Nilsson,
who was the first Swedish player that came to the United States and
played at Arizona State University, played here. Without really thinking,
that’s who comes to mind for me.

Gill

Did that event help bring publicity and visibility to your program?

Turner

Oh, lots and lots of publicity, and I think it really helped here in
Stillwater to kind of get us accepted as being worthy because we didn’t
finish last, and so that was exciting. (Laughs)

Gill

Do you remember where you finished?

Turner

I think we finished twelfth.

Gill

Out of how many teams?

Turner

I think there were twenty-four.

Gill

In the middle of the pack, that’s pretty great. Back to AIAW, there are a
couple of questions I want to ask you. What were the feelings amongst
the leadership in the AIAW generally about the switch to NCAA
governance?

Turner

Very disappointed. Very disappointed.

19

Gill

What was your disappointment primarily?

Turner

Because they wanted to keep their own identity and their own governing
body. As I said, it was the athletic directors of the universities and the
presidents, I guess. I don’t know who decided all of this. But that’s when
the switch happened, and what happened is we hosted our last AIAW,
and then we went to NCAA championships.

Gill

So, there was a little bit of a, maybe not a good analogy, but shotgun
wedding, maybe kind of pulled to the altar on this thing. I think you said
a little bit earlier, but just sort of summarizing, generally what were the
philosophical differences between the two organizations? This was
interesting. In your transition, you moved right over to the women’s golf
committee for the NCAA, so you were right there when it happened on
both sides of it. What were the philosophical differences?

Turner

I wanted to do that because if we were going to switch, I wanted to be
involved. I wanted to make sure we got things done the way it should be
done. And that wasn’t real popular, either, for AIAW, for me to switch
from AIAW golf committee to NCAA golf committee, but I did that
because I felt like that was going to happen and I wanted to be in on it.
Differences, right away the number of participants in the national
championship was cut down. Right away, the athletic department started
eliminating sports because they couldn’t fund them all. Some of the
things that were positive, I guess, was we didn’t duplicate sports
information. Some of the duplications that we had were funneled all into
one department. We still kept our women’s athletic director, but she
became less powerful. I don’t know how to explain it. We lost our
governing power.

Gill

Did you feel any difference in impact on budgets, salaries, facilities
when you moved over?

Turner

Was there any difference? You mean, did we become better?

Gill

Better or worse? The same?

Turner

Well, I think some of it became better. Facilities maybe became better,
somewhat. They still weren’t equal by any means. I’m trying to think
back on how it impacted me. I’ve been under several athletic directors at
Oklahoma State University and I can’t think of a time when I wasn’t
pushing for equality. So, I think things became a little better, but it never
got equal.

20

Gill

Was part of the anticipation of moving to the NCAA that additional
money is available?

Turner

Yes, and additional funding for national championships and things like
that, and that didn’t happen. As I said, our championships numbers were
cut way down. Like I said, we used to have like 128 participants in our
national championship, and I think they cut it down to seventysomething. We fought for a long time to get those numbers up, but they
had a certain formula they went by and they applied it to the women.
Well, the women hadn’t been in it that long to—I felt like they should
have adjusted their formula, but they didn’t. NCAA should have, in my
opinion, had a different formula for the women. You know, there were
many, many more men’s programs in golf than there were women’s, but
the women’s programs that were playing were really competitive.

Gill

What years did you serve on the AIAW committee and then what years
did you serve in the NCAA?

Turner

Okay, let me think. I think I started serving on the AIAW committee in
’78 because I was hosting the ’79 championship, and then I don’t know
if it was 1980 or ’81 when I went into the NCAA. I know it was in 1981
that I went to Japan. I think it was Japan. I took three players over there
with the NCAA. That was the first time they took women, and I was
their coach. And then I served on the NCAA until like 1987 or ’88. I
don’t remember those exact dates.

Gill

Ann, let me go back to a statement that you made earlier. You were
sometimes not fully appreciated by some of your fellow coaches because
you moved over to the NCAA committee. Did AIAW continue for a time
after NCAA [was formed]?

Turner

No.

Gill

Okay. How many of them moved with you?

Turner

Everybody did because there was no AIAW.

Gill

But on the committee that chose to then join the NCAA?

Turner

Yes, I think there were a couple of us. I can’t remember who was on the
golf committee at first that was on the AIAW committee. I’m having a
real hard time remembering that, but we had a very, very good
committee on the NCAA committee, the very first one.

Gill

How many people would have been on AIAW’s golf committee? Fifteen?

21

Turner

Ten, twelve, something like that.

Gill
Turner

Only two of you then chose to go over into the NCAA?
I don’t know how many of us went over there.

Gill

Two or three, but a small number.

Turner

Yes, but we had about ten on the golf committee, too, NCAA, I think.
We had different divisions: division one, division two, and division
three. This was the other thing that was different. We had one
championship for all divisions, so we had to include division three and
division two and division one. When we were our own people, we had
our own separate championships. NCAA made us go together. That was
different. I just now remembered that, but I learned a lot on being on a
committee with some division three people and some division two
people, too. It’s a whole different philosophy.

Gill

When the program came together under the umbrella of the Department
of Intercollegiate Athletics, that was fairly soon after Dick Young was
hired as OSU’s new AD. What year were the programs officially
merged? You said ’80, ’81?

Turner

I think we had our first NCAA championship in ’81. I’m not positive,
but I think it was in ’81 that we had our first.

Gill

Maybe that ’79-’80 year they started the transition?

Turner

Yes, yes.

Gill

Did different sports select when they moved out of AIAW into the NCAA,
or did all of it…

Turner

No, all of it happened at the same time. I think all of it did. I think all of
it happened at one time. I remember one year we had our last AIAW
national championship and our first NCAA championship in the same
season. So, May and June, and we had two championships: our last
AIAW and our first NCAA.

Gill

That would have been in ’81?

Turner

I think it was ’81. I’m not positive on that, but I think it was ’81.

Gill

You alluded to this a little bit earlier, but how was the folding of the
women’s sports program into the intercollegiate athletics department
perceived by supporters of the women’s program, players, coaches,
alumni, fans?

22

Turner

Going into the Athletic Department?

Gill

Yes.

Turner

I think they felt like it was going to be a good thing. Everybody could
identify with the NCAA. They never could figure out what AIAW was.
They’d call it AWAI. They just called it everything. They didn’t even
know what it was, so AIAW was not a familiar name to our fans or the
students or anything, but NCAA was. So, it made it more familiar.

Gill

What was the perception of the supporters of the men’s sports? Were
they positive about bringing women’s sports into…

Turner

Leery, I would think leery because they felt like we were going to take
something away from them.

Gill

What would that be?

Turner

Money.

Gill

Money, facilities, budget, travel, scholarships, etc.?

Turner

Money, yes. Money controls everything.

Gill

You mentioned an athletic director. Was that still Susan Hall? When you
did the merger, who was the Director of Women’s Athletics?

Turner

Susan Hall was our women’s athletic director, and I’m thinking that
when we first moved over there that Floyd Gass was the athletic
director, but he wasn’t long. I know that Dick Soergel was the financial
person, but I’m trying to think of who was the next athletic director. I
think it was Dick Young.

Gill

And many felt that Dick Young’s hiring, in fact, was due partly to his
experience in merging men’s and women’s [athletics] from Bowling
Green University, where he had been previously. In your opinion, how
supportive was Young in women’s sports?

Turner

I think he was supportive, but, you know, he could only do what he had
money to do with. We were all scratching and scrambling for the dollar
because we needed more money to support our programs, and so was it
going to come from the men or where was it going to come from?

Gill

How effective do you think he was in managing that merger?

23

Turner

I think he was good. I really do.

Gill

During Dick’s tenure, which I think went through about ’83, so summer
of ’78 to ’83, were there noticeable changes during his tenure in
budgets, facilities, coaches’ salaries for women? Did you see any
noticeable change in those?

Turner

Yes, you know, my salary was increased once we—I’m trying to think
of how my salary got increased, but I was still on ten months. When I
was first hired at $200 a month, that was part-time pay. Well, you can’t
coach part-time. There’s no way because if you travel, it’s 24/7 or 24/4,
however many days you’re there with them. You have to travel and stay
with them. So, anyway, there was no way to be part-time. So, I did get
my salary up before I went to the NCAA and then it was increased, but I
was still on ten months. And I remember—I’ll never forget this—they
were going to put me on twelve month but leave my salary the same,
(Laughter) and I thought, “You know, that’s a pay cut, I think.” So, I
fought that and I got an increase, two more months of monthly salary
because really OSU pays you by the month. So, they just gave me two
more months and made me on twelve months, so that was good. So, I
think things happened, but it was very slow and it was not very high.

Gill

What was your salary at the time when you went into the merger? Do
you mind saying?

Turner

Well, I don’t even remember, but I’m thinking that I was maybe making
$10,000. I’m not sure. I don’t remember that because I didn’t make very
much money for a long time. It took a long time.

Gill

So, in your opinion, were the women’s sports programs stronger after
the merger than before? What’s your feeling about that?

Turner

I think they were. There were fewer of us, if you want to know.

Gill

Fewer sports?

Turner

Yes.

Gill

Some of them that were cut out were…

Turner

Yes, they ended up dropping gymnastics, volleyball. Now, volleyball
and gymnastics were there for a while, and they dropped swimming and
diving and field hockey pretty quickly, I’m thinking. And then they
dropped volleyball and gymnastics, so we’ve done a lot of dropping of
sports instead of adding sports at OSU. That is one thing that I do know
for a fact. (Laughs)

24

Gill
Turner

There’s a minimum amount the NCAA requires you to take, and they
kind of moved to that minimum number of sports, didn’t they?
Yes.

Gill

In the early years were there issues of visibility for your program and
the other women’s programs?

Turner

Issues of visibility?

Gill

Like media coverage.

Turner

Oh, definitely. It was always hard for the women to get any kind of
media coverage. It’s so much better today, but it’s hard to remember
what it was like then.

Gill

Was OSU’s sports information department helpful to you? Was there
somebody assigned in the department to help with women’s sports?

Turner

Yes, we had somebody to do that, and we had some kind of a media
guide, and we had some kind of schedule printout. It was better than we
had had before, but it wasn’t equal. That’s what I’m going to say.
(Laughs) That’s the only way I can say it.

Gill

Could you speak to what kind of coverage you were getting at that time
in the O’Colly, Stillwater NewsPress, Oklahoma City, Tulsa papers for
your program?

Turner

Very little coverage. Maybe if we were in the same tournament Tulsa
was in we could get coverage, but it was usually in the results section in
very small print, not big articles unless we did something. If we did
something exciting, like when we had Val Skinner, she was a very well
known player and very successful, we got some coverage on her.

Gill

Did you or someone on your staff have to write up something yourself?

Turner

No, I never wrote it, but I would do a lot of the calling.

Gill

You were sort of called on to promote your program?

Turner

Yes.

Gill

Now, you think coaches would say, “That’s not my job. Someone in the
department does that,” but you…

Turner

I didn’t let that happen. I’d promote it. I pushed.

25

Gill

Just sort of wrapping up this era, again, the mid-seventies, earlyeighties era, are there some stories, special memories that you have,
some joyful, some humorous, and maybe some painful from this time
that you could tell?

Turner

Of the seventies and eighties? Well, one of the exciting things was
recruiting Val Skinner because she was probably our first big name
recruit. We were very successful in her time there. Val Skinner, and then
Alicia Smales came in and she was very successful. Well, she was Alicia
Ogrin at the time. Patty McGraw was on the team then. We just had a
very young, competitive, exciting team and they were so appreciative
and it was a lot of fun. And I think as time went on, and women’s sports
became more accepted and more girls got to play, scholarships became
the most important thing that everybody was after, and parents got really
involved. Everything changed at that—you could just see it changing.
Once the parents got involved in wanting their children to get
scholarships, full rides, it was different, but it was all fun. I loved every
minute of it. I loved coaching a Japanese team. When I took the three
girls from here over to Japan, Juli Inkster, Val Skinner and Kris
Monahan, it was great.

Gill

There was another impact on the timeline that affected your program,
the quality of players coming out of high school and junior programs
because of the schools had to also enact the program.

Turner

Exactly. It sifted down on into high school and junior high.

Gill

So in talking about recruiting, the quality of the players that were
coming up [increased].

Turner

And there were more of them. More of them to go around, yes.

Gill

Getting back to, specifically, your program, we talked about women’s
sports and that transition. In 1976, you were the coach in charge of the
new program, recruiting a team, scheduling tournaments, finding
playing facilities, managing a budget, everything. I am wondering what
was going through your mind, like, “Why did I ever take this job?”

Turner

No, I loved it.

Gill

You loved it.

Turner

I was so excited about it. See, I was still going to school. I had two more
years on my degree program. I wasn’t finished yet, so when I started
coaching I was also going to school as a graduate student. But, oh, I

26

loved it.
Gill

Did you have concerns about how well your playing career had
prepared you for coaching?

Turner

Well, you know what I had concerns about was, was I ever going to get
to play again? Was I ever going to get to play in the Country Club
events? But then I got so involved in this that it didn’t bother me
anymore. But that’s all I knew was what I was doing socially, and then I
got into this and I just loved it.

Gill

Did you have priorities for recommended programs, some things you
needed to do, one, two, three?

Turner

Well, we needed more money for travel, and so I knew that I was going
to have to raise that for travel and uniforms and equipment and stuff that
we wanted to do. I just wanted to bring our program up to where Tulsa
University was. The women’s program at Tulsa University is what I
remember. I wanted to be as competitive as they were. You know, and
we needed to travel by airplanes sometimes and not take these twelvehour drives in a van that were just awful and rickety and you wondered
if it was going to make it. So, just upgrading everything.

Gill

Can you recall your first competitive golf event you coached, when it
was, and what do you remember about it?

Turner

Yes, I remember we went to Oklahoma City at Lincoln Park, and we
played in the Susie Maxwell Berning All-College Classic. Joan
Blumenthal was the OU coach who hosted that tournament and she
invited us. We were so excited to be included and it was just exciting. I
remember I gave each player one golf ball. I didn’t even know.
(Laughter) I didn’t know anything different than, “One will be enough,
won’t it?” And they were just like, “I guess.” (Laughter) I just had a
dozen balls, so I wasn’t prepared, but I learned quickly. I really learned
quickly and it was so much fun. I loved meeting all the coaches and
listening to them because they had been competing. Women’s golf was
competing out there way before we got started. Some of these coaches of
women’s teams were great. They were legends and I loved meeting them
and talking to them and learning from them. I listened and it was just
great. I loved it.

Gill

I’ve got to ask you, did you have enough balls to finish the tournament?

Turner

Yes, we did. (Laughs)

Gill

How many to spare?

27

Turner
Gill

I don’t know. I don’t remember, but I just remember that I learned from
then on that one isn’t enough. (Laughter)
I can imagine the girls were like, “What if I slice this?”

Turner

Oh yes.

Gill

Then go find that ball. Amy Weeks was telling me the story, and I hope
you don’t mind me mentioning, about at practice, you would give them
one ball and [they had to] follow that ball. You’re responsible for
keeping that one ball. (Laughter) Were there differences when it
changed at that time from AIAW? Did you change some rules, the
number of players’ scores you counted, the number of players that could
participate, any differences?

Turner

No, no. That remained about the same.

Gill

What about special challenges that you faced in those first couple of
years? It had to be pretty daunting, and you had a lot of enthusiasm and
excitement, but just the whole momentum, getting the program started,
what were your major challenges?

Turner

Coaching women, because I had two boys at home. I had been in a house
of males. Coaching women is totally different. Being around a bunch of
females and trying to get them to be cohesive, that was hard. And the
other thing I learned is to be honest with them, not to try to act like I
knew something I didn’t know because they could see through that. So, I
learned right on that I was going to be honest, that I’m not a golf teacher.
I’m not as good as you are. I will get you help if you need help. I knew
my strengths and I knew my weaknesses really pretty quick and I wanted
to be fair. That was one of my most important things was to be fair and
honest with them.

Gill

What were some of the biggest challenges you had with the girls?

Turner

I don’t know if I can pinpoint one of the biggest challenges. Val Skinner
was a challenge for me right off the bat. She was wild and came to
school and was wild and crazy, and I had to hang in there with her. I
knew that she was going to be okay if I could just get her back the next
year. She came in the year of ’78 when we were hosting the national
championship in ’79, and she didn’t make the team.

Gill

Wow.

Turner

If you can believe that. What an outstanding person she turned out to be,
though. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful golfer, person, philanthropist,

28

great, so I learned to hang in there with them, to give them a chance, let
them grow up and to realize that they will grow up. That’s the thing I
think was the biggest challenge. You want to hurry up the growing up
and the maturity process, but you can’t.
Gill

Recruiting, did you have scholarship money?

Turner

Some.

Gill

What the NCAA or AIAW allowed you or did you have other forms of
financial aid you were able to offer?

Turner

No, this all came from the university. I had a certain amount, and so I
would just give somebody tuition. Usually half-rides was the key right
then, was to give everybody tuition.

Gill

Golf is what they call an equivalency sport where you break your
scholarships down into partials and…

Turner

Yes. Break it down. I had kind of forgotten about that. Yes, it was, so I
tried to have at least six players on some kind of money.

Gill

Ann, did other programs that you were competing against have pretty
similar kinds of budgets and scholarship offers?

Turner

No. I felt like they were further along than we were. Much further along.
They weren’t as new. They had come into existence a couple of years
before. It makes a difference.

Gill

Practice in early years, I think you said earlier that Lakeside Golf
Course is where you worked out.

Turner

Yes.

Gill

Can you tell me a little bit about that? Were the facilities adequate for
you?

Turner

Well, Lakeside at that time did not have a driving range. They had a
driving range, but you hit your own balls. So, I had to get practice balls
for all the girls and they had to pick them up. Well, they didn’t like
doing that, but looking back on this, it was the best practice ever because
when you have to pick up your own golf balls, you care where they go.
So, they were a little bit more diligent in their practice, a little bit slower.
Practiced a little bit more methodically. And, you know, also, when you
walk out there to pick up your golf balls, you’re learning that feel of
distance without knowing you’re learning. You don’t just stand there

29

Gill

and hit to something that you think is 150 yards because you’re walking
out there to pick it up and you kind of can judge your distance. I thought
it was excellent practice, looking back on it.
In those early years what would have been a typical practice week for
your team?

Turner

Well, we’d go to Lakeside in the afternoon after they got out of class.
They’d come out there and hit balls, and then maybe they’d play nine or
eighteen holes or whatever they wanted to play. Labron was always
there early on and he would help them with their swing if they were
wanting to learn something or do something. And then if we were trying
to go to a tournament, I would try to have three days of qualifying, and
that means that they would go out and play eighteen holes and you’d
rank the scores and take the top five players to the tournament.

Gill

How many women would you have on the team?

Turner

I might have eight to ten, and sometimes I had twelve. Twelve was too
many. Can’t control twelve.

Gill

But you’d only travel with six.

Turner

No, five.

Gill

So, they’re in competition, then.

Turner

Yes, but see a lot of walk-ons, a lot of walk-ons, which was fine. You
wanted a big squad. You wanted competition, but really if you could
have six players competing for five spots, that was ideal.

Gill

Were you out there with them, observing practice?

Turner

Yes, watching.

Gill

At that point, I know later in your career you had morning workouts.
Early on, did you have the girls come and do…

Turner

Any kind of fitness program? No, not early on. Well yes, I did have,
early on, fitness programs. I asked them to all jog, to run a mile or
something like that, so I did have that early on. I don’t know that we did
it as a group. They were to do it on their own, and I trusted them to do it
on their own. (Laughs)

Gill

Oh, my gosh.

Turner

I know.

30

Gill

What was your travel budget like?

Turner

I don’t remember what my travel budget was like, but we traveled. I
drove a lot.

Gill

Did you have a team van or something?

Turner

Yes, we had athletic vans of some kind. We’d have that and they were
just awful, but we did it. I did most of the driving and sometimes I
would let one of the girls drive if we were driving late at night and I was
getting tired, but I always had this rule that the driver gets the ticket,
pays the fine.

Gill

Most of them let you do the driving then, didn’t they? (Laughs) Where
did you stay?

Turner

The cheapest place we could find.

Gill

Motel 8.

Turner

Yes, well, I don’t know. Most tournaments we played had a headquarters
and so we’d try to stay there, but we doubled up. There’d be three and
two in a room, and then one of them would stay with me. So, we usually
had two rooms, three and three.

Gill

The lucky one got to stay with the coach?

Turner

Yes, two of them had to stay with me, because we’d have six people
counting me.

Gill

Have two rooms and three to a room.

Turner

Yes, so I bunked with them. I stopped that soon after about a year. I
decided, “I’m not doing this. I’m going to get my own room. I don’t like
that.” Oh, I didn’t like it.

Gill

Can you talk about what a typical season would be like and where you
were going? How many tournaments did you have in the fall and the
spring and where were you playing?

Turner

Well, I remember we went to Oklahoma City and played in the AllCollege Classic. And then we were fortunate enough to get invited to the
Dick McGuire Invitational in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and we drove
out there. It’s a long drive up through nothing. We’d play some of the
Big 8 tournaments. I mean, if Kansas had a Sunflower Tournament, then

31

we went up there and we drove. Where else did we go? We played at
Texas A&M one time. We played there in a tournament. We drove to
that. We went to the University of Texas, and we drove there and played
in that tournament. Wherever the Big 8 tournament was, we played in
that. I’m trying to think of early on where else we went. Mostly just
locally around, someplace we could drive.
Gill

How many tournaments would you do in the fall and the spring?

Turner

You know, I don’t remember that exactly. I think we probably had
maybe three in the fall and four in the spring, counting Big 8, and maybe
five in the spring counting the Big 8 championship.

Gill

You were talking about the early part of your career and those first
[tournaments in the] late ’70s, early ’80s. How did you do nationally
competitively?

Turner

Well, we got to play in the National Championship, AIAW. The first
year, we sent an individual to Hawaii.

Gill

Wow.

Turner

I know it, and so I got to go to Hawaii. I didn’t have a clue. I never even
watched her play golf. I just enjoyed Hawaii, (Laughter) but that was
Patty Zimmer, our very first entry into the national championship. That’s
when I kind of got involved because I went to the coaches meetings and
I got really involved in this. I said, “I like this. I want to work in it and
get involved in it.” So, that was my first endeavor.

Gill

Did you feel that you had adequate resources to build a competitive
program?

Turner

As I’ve said before, no. I needed more money to travel and to compete in
the bigger tournaments. I can remember when we first got invited to the
Lady Gator in Florida. We were so excited to fly down there and play in
the Lady Gator Invitational for Mimi Ryan, who became a very good
friend of mine in coaching, and that was just one of the highlights of the
whole season.

Gill

What year was that, again? Did you say?

Turner

I think the first time we went down there was probably in ’79.

Gill

So, the first time you flew as a team.

Turner

Well, I’m not sure that was the first time we flew as a team, but that was

32

the first time we went there because I can remember that Val and Patty, I
think they were freshmen. Val Skinner and Patty McGraw were
freshmen, and they were so excited to be there. They had put baby oil all
over their body to get this suntan. That was the thing they did in those
days, and they came in and they just looked awful. Everything was stuck
to them. Dirt, grass was all over them. (Laughs) Anyway, I’ll never
forget that. That was so funny.
Gill

Again, in your early career, how did you feel about what kind of
administrative support you got with the department?

Turner

I don’t think I worried about it so much. You know, I just kind of went
about my own business and tried to do what I could to support the team
and raise money and have fundraisers and do all of this, and that was just
my way of dealing with the inadequacies, I guess. I wanted us to be able
to play at the Country Club, and we tried to work it out where we could
play two days a week there, and we did that, and I don’t remember the
details of that at this point in time. That’s been a long time ago, but I do
remember that we got to play there two days a week for a while, and that
was just wonderful.

Gill

Were you restricted in any way in fundraising on who you could contact
or not? Were there any guidelines on fundraising?

Turner

Nobody gave me any guidelines on this, so I did it all. I had a group of
friends here that helped me organize stuff, and we did everything we
could to raise money.

Gill

If I’m correct, somewhere around’79 was when OSU actually started the
Cowgirl Classic, but before that, could you talk about your fundraising,
how it evolved into the tournament?

Turner

Well, I know I had a clinic one time, a spur of the moment clinic that
Labron put on for me out at Lakeside, and I probably had twenty women
out there or something like that. That was our first little bit of
fundraising.

Gill

They, maybe, paid fifty bucks a head or something like that?

Turner

No, they probably paid twenty-five, something like that, just anything to
get anything going. And then, I had a clinic out at Stillwater Country
Club and pros donated their time, and I think I charged fifty dollars then,
and we had different stations. That was a one-day event. I had Paul
Hanks, Freddy Forbes, Jackie Riggs Hutchinson. Gervis McGraw came
over from Ponca City. So, I had all of these pros there donating their
time to give lessons and raise money there. Then I met Bob Toski at a

33

clinic somewhere and talked to him, and he said he could come in for a
minimum amount of money and he’d be glad to do it. So, he flew in and
I did a Bob Toski clinic, and then he played golf with Jimmy Johnson,
and I think it was Alicia or Val that played with them, and that was an
exhibition. Raised money doing that.
And then I had Varsity Duffer Day, which was for the women. They
paid a certain amount of money, and they came over and played
Stillwater Country Club, played with the team members and got to know
them, and that was very successful. I didn’t charge a whole lot of money,
but it got interest, which I think is important. And then in the spring I
had the Cowgirl Golf Classic for men and it’d be the same kind of thing.
I learned early on that men give differently than women, especially in
that day and age, so I separated them because I didn’t want the men
paying less, and I knew the women wouldn’t pay more. So, I had two
events. (Laughs)
Gill

So, what were those two events again?

Turner

Varsity Duffer Day for the women in the fall. They loved it. And the
Cowgirl Golf Classic in the spring for men.

Gill

Can you tell me how you came up with the idea, because were you one
of the few women’s programs that was doing that kind of event at that
time?

Turner

In our athletic department? Yes.

Gill

And in this region in terms of women’s golf. I mean, having a
fundraising tournament.

Turner

Well, I knew to do it because the men were having the Cowboy Pro-Am
every year, so I knew that this could be done. I didn’t know how to get
started exactly, so I got some people together from different parts of the
state, and we met, and we had kind of a beginning recruiting people to
come play in it, and after that started it kind of snowballed.

Gill

Did you talk to Mike about his tournament? Was he helpful in giving you
ideas of starting…

Turner

Not really, no.

Gill

When you first started, what were the gift levels for the Cowgirl Classic?

Turner

Well, it was probably $100. I don’t remember exactly. I could look back.
I’ll tell you who helped me with this the most was Labron to kind of

34

know what to do, how to kind of get it going, the format and everything.
Gill
Turner

Did he give you some suggestions on people you could invite, as well?
No.

Gill

Relationships?

Turner

No, not really. He didn’t do a lot of fundraising when he was a coach at
all.

Gill

Ann, can you describe for those who haven’t been to a Cowgirl Golf
Classic the format and how it worked?

Turner

The fundraiser for the men in the spring? The Cowgirl Golf Classic?
Well, they would send in their pairings. If they wanted to play with a
foursome, they’d send in the money and list a foursome. Then I would
have a Cowgirl play with them, a Cowgirl Golfer. We called ourselves
Cowgirl Golfers. I would have a Golfer play with them, nine holes or
three holes, depending on how many people I had. Then they would drop
back and play with a group behind them and stuff like that, so that they
would get to meet everybody. We’d have it in the afternoon on a Friday,
and then we’d have hors d’oeuvres and drinks afterwards. They’d get to
mingle with the girls, and it was just really, really neat because they got
to meet them and [develop] an interest in them.

Gill

Were they surprised at the quality of golf from the women?

Turner

Oh definitely.

Gill

Did they come back humbled just a little bit at the end of the day?

Turner

A lot of them always told me they played the best golf they played in the
Classic because after playing with the young women, their tempo was
better. (Laughter)

Gill

I had to ask that because I recall talking to some of the men that
participated that said, “Wow, they can drive off a tee. Women can play
golf.”

Turner

They can play.

Gill

So, that had to be a plus for you.

Turner

Oh yes. See, they have to know that it’s really a worthwhile project, I
guess, that we had going.

35

Gill

Women’s golf was not a Friday afternoon at the Country Club. These
were serious competitive golfers.

Turner

Yes. These people could play.

Gill

How has it evolved? Say when you left in 2000 at the end of your career,
what was the ante for participating in the classic at that point?

Turner

Well, it was much higher. I think it was $300 individual. I’m not sure if
that’s the price, and maybe $500 for two. How did we do that? We made
an exception on the giving if you brought four. Four would be twelve. It
was probably $1,000 for four or something like that. We wanted as many
people there as possible, and we wanted to make money. (Laughs)

Gill

Those first couple years can you tell me how much you were getting
from Duffer Day and the Classic?

Turner

Well, I can tell you this, we were charging twenty-five dollars for Duffer
Day, and we were giving them lunch, so we weren’t making a lot of
money there, but the key to it was to get interest. You know, if you get
interest, then when they give money to the athletic department, maybe
they’ll designate some to go to Cowgirl Golf. You know, this is kind of
what my thinking was. I wanted people to be interested in and care about
our program, and then you can go on and raise the money a little bit. So,
I think by the time I was finished with Duffer Day, I was charging
seventy-five dollars or something like that.

Gill

About how many participants would you have?

Turner

Oh, we’d have a lot. I’m thinking seventy-two people would be a
foursome on eighteen holes. We’d have at least seventy-two women.
Maybe more than that.

Gill

Great. What were you netting on the spring Classic?

Turner

Well, we were making more, and I think I always tried to net $10,000.
And I didn’t set my sights as high maybe as the men’s program was
doing, but I felt like if we netted $10,000 that would just be a place, and
then that went in my Development Foundation Fund and I could use it
for stuff.

Gill

Did you have discretion on how you could use that extra fundraising
money that you brought in each year? Could you put some in
scholarships, some in travel?

Turner

I used it mostly for maintenance. I think maybe we did use some things

36

Gill

for scholarships. I’m not sure if that was allowed or not. I can’t
remember if we did that or if I could meet some other needs. The
university might give me more money for scholarships.
I’ll put it this way: you were rewarded. By being able to use the extra
money, they didn’t adjust according to what you brought in, what you
were getting from the athletic department?

Turner

No, not necessarily, but maybe a little because they knew I could raise it,
so they didn’t keep increasing mine, and they were helping the others
that weren’t fundraising. I did get that drift.

Gill

(Laughs) You were carrying the load for some of your…

Turner

Well, I was doing what I could for our program and…

Gill

Speaking of the program, at that point, referring back to around the
early ’80s, late ’70s, were the resources that you had available to you
similar to the men’s programs? For example, golf. Were the resources
financial-wise fairly similar budgets?

Turner

I don’t think so. I wasn’t privy to know what the men had, but I knew
that they were traveling different than we were, (Laughs) and they had
Country Club memberships.

Gill

So, when did you finally get the Country Club full-time? You talked
about at one time in the early ’80s you moved a couple of days of
practice and then did you eventually get to where you worked out of…

Turner

No, I think that was in the late ’70s, very early ’80s, we got to play at the
Country Club, and then I think I worked out something with the Country
Club where I bought some memberships. I don’t remember exactly how
all this went, but I know that we bought some memberships and maybe it
was because I had raised enough money to be able to do that. I’m not
real sure how all that worked, and I had the athletic department involved
in this, so they might have helped me some on that. I’m real fuzzy on
that. I don’t remember the details.

Gill

Eventually in the transition you started practicing and playing out of the
Country Club, of course.

Turner

Yes. We were restricted, I think. I don’t think we were allowed to play
there on Saturdays and Sundays. I can’t remember if we were or weren’t,
but eventually we became full members and could go out there a lot. At
first we weren’t full members.

Gill

Did you have locker room privileges or changing…

37

Turner

No, we had no locker room.

Gill

How would you compare your program with the resources you had, the
facilities you had with others you were competing against, say in the Big
8, in the region?

Turner

Well, I think in the Big 8, our biggest competitor that I would compare
ourselves to would be OU. The other schools in the Big 8 were not up to
the competitiveness of the nation. They were just getting started and they
weren’t nationally competitive. That’s what I’ll say. And I wanted OSU
to be nationally competitive, so that’s where I focused. We were going
to play the best tournaments, the most competitive tournaments we
could, and so that’s where I focused my attention, on getting enough
money so that we could travel to these better tournaments and be
nationally competitive. And I got that idea from Tulsa University, to be
honest with you, because she had a very nationally competitive team.

Gill

When you got some additional resources, did your tournament schedule
change? Were you able to add more tournaments?

Turner

Yes, better tournaments. Better tournaments, meaning we traveled to
California, to Arizona, to Florida, wherever the better tournaments were.

Gill

And you were flying to those events?

Turner

Yes.

Gill

And that was basically just the outcome of your fundraising, more
resources?

Turner

Yes.

Gill

How did your coaching philosophy evolve over this period? Can you
talk about, not in total because I want to come back and ask you about
what it looked like in 2000, but just in those first few years, how did your
philosophy about coaching evolve?

Turner

I think when I first went in it I was very competitive and I just wanted to
win, win, win, win, win, you know. And I was going to do anything I
had to to win, win, win, win, but then I got a little bit more involved with
the future of these young women and what this was going to mean to
them, and that meant a lot to me, and I cared about them. I recruited. I
had never recruited in my life, and I had to get out and recruit. I
recruited people that I thought were going to make us nationally
competitive, and I brought them into OSU, and I wanted them to love

38

OSU.
My coaching philosophy changed. I think I was able to learn a lot from
some of the traditional coaches that had been there. I went to a lot of
coaching seminars. I went to teaching seminars. I wanted to learn as
much about golf as I could. I wanted to be knowledgeable because I was
recruiting nationally. I didn’t want them to come in here and have me
not know what was going on. I knew I wasn’t a teacher, but I wanted to
learn as much as I could about the golf swing so that I could guide them.
My coaching philosophy changed because I wanted to learn more, I
guess, and be more knowledgeable in golf, swing, competition, and I
also wanted to know how to manage people. And so I really worked a lot
on the mental part because I knew that that’s where I could help them, is
the mental part of the game.
Gill

Could you share some of how you did that, how you coached that part of
the game?

Turner

Well, I read a lot and studied a lot about the mental part of golf. I had
friends here at OSU and I gave them personality tests so they could learn
about themselves. Just anything I could possibly come up with I tried, to
help them mentally.

Gill

So, you gave your players a personality test?

Turner

I did that one time, yes, and it was really interesting and I took it with
them, and I remember one player said, “Oh, now I understand why you
are the way you are.”

Gill

(Laughter) They started analyzing you?

Turner

Yes, and it really helped. Just different things like that.

Gill

Did you discover a certain type of personality that’s a better golfer than
another?

Turner

No, I didn’t, but I understood them more once I understood their
personalities, and that’s important because they’re not all the same.

Gill

Can you talk a little bit about your recruiting process in those early
years? Can you walk us through your recruiting of a typical athlete?
How would that evolve and the larger part of your relationships with
high school coaches, junior golf coaches, etc.?

Turner

Well, I don’t think I had any relationships with high school coaches and
junior college coaches. Really, I went to the high school tournament here

39

in Oklahoma and walked around and watched, you know. I did that kind
of thing, and that’s kind of how you see what’s going on. You know who
the leading players are and you kind of watch them, and if you’re
wanting to recruit them, you just show up so they’ll know you’re
interested. That’s basically what recruiting is, to let them know you’re
interested, and you kind of know when you go out to a tournament later
on. Not right at first but later on, I started going out in the summer to the
national junior tournaments, and basically it was to let them know you’re
interested by being there because there were rules. You couldn’t talk to
them and stuff.
Gill

Was that where the really top flight were coming from, those competitive
junior college programs even more than high school at that time?

Turner

Right.

Gill

Did you develop relationships with some junior program coaches at all?

Turner

Not really, no. I didn’t really know how to recruit early on. I did the best
I could by writing letters and that type of thing. The men were recruiting
much more vigorously than the women were. I’m talking about coaches
of women’s sports. They were not recruiting as vigorously as the
coaches of the men’s sports were, but we soon learned to.

Gill

What would have been your steps? So, you’d pick up a student
somewhere maybe as a junior or senior that summer after junior year.
They’re having a great junior season or maybe they were a medalist at
the state tournament. How did you then pursue a student?

Turner

Write a letter, send them information about Oklahoma State University.

Gill

Make visits to their home or their school?

Turner

I did. I didn’t do that with all of them. I didn’t have to. I asked them to
come over, and they would come over for a recruiting day or something
like that, and I’d show them around OSU and talk to them, you know,
just do all that kind of stuff.

Gill

What are some of the things you would do, typical activities, when you
had a student athlete or a prospective student athlete?

Turner

Early on?

Gill

Yes, on campus.

Turner

I would just have my office in the HPER center, is where I was officing

40

at the time, and I’d take them around campus because I always thought
the OSU campus was just beautiful. I wanted them to walk on that, go to
the Student Union and see everything, show them the Country Club or
Lakeside, go out there and do all that, just show them everything.
Gill

And so then you’d follow up with letters. Now what was your recruiting
territory? Did you recruit nationwide?

Turner

I was trying to recruit nationwide, yes. I recruited Alicia Ogrin from
Illinois, Val Skinner from Nebraska. You get tips on players, and you
just kind of follow up on it and they came down and visited.

Gill

Ann, what do you think was attractive to competitive golfers about
Oklahoma State? You had a young program. You couldn’t have
established a lot of national prominence or attention yet. How were you
getting some of these better golfers in the early years?

Turner

I think one thing is it felt like they were wanted here. They could be the
big wig. All of these special golfers are big in their hometown or
wherever they are, and they go to a school with a bunch of other
number-one golfers and they’re just another golfer. This was the
beginning of a program, and I think they kind of looked at that like
exciting, that this was going to be something that they could help build.
Plus, maybe it was closer to where they were living and they didn’t want
to go to California or Florida or something like that, and they wanted to
be closer.

Gill

You were talking about some of your better golfers you got from out-ofstate, but let’s say in-state and states surrounding Oklahoma and Texas,
was that where most of your players were coming from?

Turner

Most of them came from Oklahoma initially.

Gill

Was women’s golf pretty strong in Oklahoma?

Turner

There were a lot of very good junior players in Oklahoma, surprisingly,
but it wasn’t because of the high schools. It was because of the state
organization and junior program.

Gill

Ann, talk a little bit, if you will, about your training. You talked about
the mental aspect of your training, your practice techniques and how it
changed from the time you started, because, again, you’re learning
about coaching, you’re learning about the sport. How did your
techniques of what you were doing change and evolve?

Turner

I think I just learned more about how to be a coach, and I figured out

41

what was important through trial and error, and so maybe that’s what
changed. From the very beginning of not knowing anything and then
listening to some legends in the coaching field and listening to how they
did things and seeing if that would fit with how I wanted to do things, I
knew early on it had to fit with me. I couldn’t try to be somebody else. I
had to be me, and these had to fit with what I felt like were important
and things I wanted to do. I always tried to make sure it fit with the way
I felt, and I don’t know what I changed, but I think I just matured and
learned more.
Gill

Did you change up your practice format during the week at all as you
moved along in your career?

Turner

Maybe so. I might have scheduled them a little bit more when I realized
that they needed more structure and maybe that I needed to practice one
area of the game a little bit more than others, but also I learned that
golfers like to do their own thing that day and not to try and schedule
them every day. Let them do what they want to in practice. So, I did
learn that. I do know that’s a change I made.

Gill

One of your former golfers told me about your morning stadium routine.
Can you share a little bit about that?

Turner

Well, later on in coaching, fitness became a real thing. Everybody was
into fitness and doing something with fitness and weight training, and I
tried to figure out how to get this done because there was always a
reason not to do it. So, I scheduled it at five thirty in the morning.

Gill

Oh, five thirty? Wow.

Turner

Because I knew that nothing was going to interfere with that, no test,
nothing. So, we met at the stadium and did stadium stairs. I didn’t make
them run them. They walked them, but I felt like that was a very good
workout for about twenty minutes. And then we left there and went to
the weight room, and we had a physical trainer and they did a weight
training routine. So, by six fifteen or six thirty they would have been
finished, so if they had a seven thirty class, they could get to it. And I
think we did that three days a week. I’m not sure. I don’t think I made
them do it every day, but they also used it as a consequence if something
happened that I didn’t think was necessarily the right thing, then I’d give
them extra.

Gill

Not punishment, just extra incentive for the next time not to do that.

Turner

Yes.

42

Gill

Kind of a behavior modification program.

Turner

Yes. And I had a group at one time that I had to change the way I felt
about that because they might not care if they had to walk ten flights of
stairs, so I made it punishment, or consequence, for the whole team. That
made them be a little bit more careful.

Gill

A little more accountability.

Turner

Yes.

Gill

That’s great. Can you share some milestones in the golf program in
these early years? You touched on some of these, but some of your
outstanding golfers and some of their successes, some of how you were
doing Big 8 tournaments, just milestones in those first five or six years.

Turner

The first five or six years? Well, I think being competitive the very first
year at the Big 8 and winning it, that was huge. And then going to the
national championship and hosting the national championship here, that
was a milestone. Knowing we were going to be competitive nationally
by doing those things was exciting because I think we won the Big 8 in
1977, and then I don’t know if we won it in ’78, but I think we won it in
’79. We won fourteen Big 8 championships, I believe, and one Big 12
while I was coaching.

Gill

How about some of your special players in those early years?

Turner

Well, I’ve had lots of special players and, gosh, I hate to name them
because I’ll leave somebody out, but Val Skinner, Alicia Ogrin, Patty
McGraw-Coatney, who was an outstanding player in Oklahoma, came to
OSU and that got a lot of interest because she was well known here.
Janice Burba Gibson who was from Oklahoma, Janet Grone Miller was
from Oklahoma. Then I got some outstanding Swedish players. I
recruited my very first Swedish players, Eva Dahllof and Katrin
Mollerstedt, and Eva turned out to be outstanding. And then I got other
Swedish players from that connection to come here. They had a great
program in Sweden so they put out a lot of junior golfers and they
played here.

Gill

In the early ’70s and ’80s, were there some turning points, some
milestones early in the program? Might have been about your players,
might have been about your fundraising, might have been about your
coaching. Just things you remember how it evolved and “We climbed
this mountain and we made this change”?

Turner

No, I don’t remember that. I think it was just gradual. I don’t remember

43

just being all of a sudden overwhelmed by something. I’m sure that we
won a tournament someplace that we went, and I’m sure that was
interesting, or an individual won a tournament and that was probably a
first. We probably had a lot of firsts in those few years and I don’t
remember them. I’m sorry, I just don’t remember them. I know the first
Big 8 championship we won and I’ll never forget that, so that was just
very exciting.
Gill

Ann, in those early years, didn’t you win most of the Big 8 tournaments?
I think you won nearly every one of them.

Turner

Yes, we were the team to beat, I guess you could say. We were the most
successful.

Gill

Did it give you a lot of sense of pride?

Turner

Yes, it did.

Gill

The rest of the conference was following the Cowgirls?

Turner

It was, and I wanted the Big 8 to get better because I wanted the
competition in the Big 8 to get better. It took awhile.

Gill

Which teams finally stepped up?

Turner

OU. University of Oklahoma, and Big 8-wise would be Missouri.
Nebraska was competitive, believe it or not. That’s about the ones that I
can remember.

Gill

You coached for a quarter of a century, twenty-four years.

Turner

That’s a long time, isn’t it?

Gill

Long time. Your retirement in 2000—sort of flipping, I’d like to ask you
some questions about your program after it evolved and it grew to a
more competitive comprehensive program. How did the financial
resources you had available to you change over a period of time?

Turner

Well, of course, I began fundraising from the very beginning and I
continued fundraising, and that was a big thing for us was to have
fundraising, but we got more support from the university. It got better,
so our budgets were a little bit better, but it was never enough. I always
needed to fundraise, and I knew that.

Gill

At what point, between you and the university, were you able to fund up
to the NCAA limit of scholarships? Did you ever get to that point?

44

Turner
Gill

Yes, we were fully funded, and I don’t remember what year that
happened, but we were fully funded on scholarships.
Would that have been in the ’80s at some point?

Turner

Yes, the ’80s.

Gill

We were laughing a little bit earlier about your travel budget, the
amount of money that you had to go to major tournaments, to be able to
fly, stay in a bit nicer [accommodations]. When did that start turning for
you?

Turner

I don’t know. I don’t remember that because I think that it just kind of
happened. The more I fundraised, the better off we were.

Gill

University funding or additional fundraising dollars or just kind of a
combination of those things?

Turner

Well, we got additional dollars once we became a part of the athletic
department. That’s when we really got more money, I think. That’s the
beginning of getting more money.

Gill

How did your funding, when you were creating your scholarships in
terms of recruiting budgets, how did that compare to the men’s
program? Do you know?

Turner

The men’s golf program? I don’t think that we ever had the budget they
did, but I’m not sure of that because I don’t think I had knowledge of
that. I just knew that we needed more money. I’ll go ahead and tell you
that. I just knew we needed more all the time.

Gill

Ann, we talked about facilities and how they changed. You started at
Lakeside and moved to Stillwater Country Club. Talk about how that
evolved, and eventually, at some point, you started playing out at
Karsten [Creek].

Turner

That was in ’94.

Gill

Can you talk about that evolution a little bit, the differences in facilities
and how the program changed in relation to the facilities you had to
work with?

Turner

Well, as I said, we started practicing at Lakeside where you hit your own
balls and picked them up. Then we started playing at Stillwater Country
Club and got to play out there more and more and more, and less and
less and less at Lakeside. Then all the practice was at Stillwater Country

45

Club because they liked hitting golf balls on the range where they didn’t
have to pick them up. But we had limited use of the range and so I made
sure that they didn’t have… Also we had a place on Nineteenth Street
here in Stillwater, and the man that lives there was Dale Ringwald. He
had a big acreage there and we hit balls there. It was right down the
street from the Country Club. Everybody had their own shag bag full of
golf balls and they could go there and hit balls right there on Nineteenth
Street. So, we hit a lot of balls there and then they could warm up on the
range at Stillwater Country Club and we hit balls there. Then in1994 we
had privileges at Karsten Creek because that’s the year it opened for us,
and we hit balls out there some and played out there some.
Gill

Did you at some point get to where you were primarily doing most of
your practice out at Karsten?

Turner

Yes, towards the end.

Gill

And I guess when they built it, the clubhouse and the locker rooms, etc.,
did you get to use those facilities in terms of locker rooms and so on?

Turner

Well, I don’t remember using the locker room that much at all.

Gill

People got dressed out before they’d come out to practice and then went
home?

Turner

Yes.

Gill

Were there some other facilities that they had available out there? Were
there any at the course? You talked about the driving range, of course,
the tough course. Playing that course is wonderful practice.

Turner

Right.

Gill

Were there other facilities they had out there that were available to your
program?

Turner

Most of them. There were some of them that weren’t available for us to
use.

Gill

You might mention what some of those were.

Turner

Well, there was some kind of a short game area and a team area that was
mostly used by the men’s program. It was reserved for them. We did
fine. We were fine.

Gill

In these later years, the same kind of question but fast forward some in

46

terms of you got better facilities, you got a better travel budget, you
could recruit nationally, play nationally. Did that impact your coaching,
your teaching? Did it continue to evolve? I’m thinking here at the end of
the ’90s. What was different about the program than let’s say in the
early era?
Turner

Recruiting became much more difficult. I mean, you had to be out there
all summer long, and that really wasn’t what I liked to do. I wanted them
to want to come here, and if I could find somebody that I was really
interested in and I wanted to communicate with them, bring them in for a
visit, maybe visit them at home, etc. But I started having to go out and
recruit. Plus we started having assistant coaches, and so I had an
assistant coach and I sent him out to do some recruiting, too. Recruiting
was not my favorite thing to do. I didn’t really like traveling all summer
long. I had traveled all year competing and I didn’t really want to travel
all year, but I did it. I had to do recruiting and that was really what
changed from the mid-’80s to 2000. You had to be out there recruiting
these players, talking to the parents, letting them see you out there,
letting them know you’re interested. And the parents became much more
involved in where their child was going to go to school because they
were wanting full scholarships and wanting to know what kind of
scholarships and what was going to be done for their child if they came
here.

Gill

In those later years, were you able to offer more full scholarships or
closer to full scholarships?

Turner

No, I had full scholarships, but you had to offer the best players a full
scholarship. You couldn’t piece it. You couldn’t give them pieces of
scholarships. Not anymore. So, you had to be careful who you recruited
because you gave them a full scholarship.

Gill

You were talking about having an assistant coach. What was the first
year you had an assistant coach?

Turner

Well, the very first year I coached, Labron Harris.

Gill

Oh, well, that’s true.

Turner

So, I had an assistant coach from then on. Labron Harris was an assistant
coach. Then I had Willard Wood, who was Willie Wood’s father, here
for a little while, lived in Stillwater. I had him for an assistant coach for
maybe two or three years. I had Fred Warren as assistant coach. Then I
had Bruce Heppler, who was here as an assistant coach for me and Mike
Holder. I guess it was Bruce who was my last assistant coach, and then I
had Sheila Dills came over to be an assistant coach for a little while part-

47

time. Then I had Amy Weeks as an assistant coach.
Gill

How did that help you? What kind of duties did you assign your
assistant coach?

Turner

Well, a lot of times they could go out to practice and they could take
care of some of that, and I didn’t have to be out there every day for
everything, and I let them kind of take over some of that, oversee it, just
to be there.

Gill

Did they do more, like as a swing coach? Did they do coaching
technique at all?

Turner

No, no.

Gill

Even Labron?

Turner

Well, Labron did. Labron really helped the girls. He was more of a
swing coach type of thing.

Gill

Which he obviously had a great success with his other players. We
talked about working out on the steps and so on. How did conditioning
and strength training change? How important was that to your program
and what kinds of things were you doing?

Turner

I think it was very important. Every program was doing strength and
conditioning, and so this became a real thing with all of the women’s
golf programs, and we were doing the same thing, mostly walking
stadium stairs and doing some weight training afterwards.

Gill

What kind of weight training were you doing?

Turner

Well, I had whoever was our physical strength trainer in our athletic
department would work with the girls and give them a program to go
through, doing some squats and some bicep stuff and just whatever.

Gill

What did you emphasize? What were specific techniques to golf that
you’re teaching your women?

Turner

I think mostly leg and arm strength, that type of thing, core. You know,
we’re not trying to build muscles, just strengthen.

Gill

We talked earlier about single players in the early era. You had some
truly outstanding players throughout your career and certainly mid-tolate years that played in the pro circuit. Can you talk about some of
those players?

48

Turner

Yes, well Val Skinner played on the pro tour, and I think she won seven
times on the LPGA Tour. Janice Burba Gibson played on the tour for
thirteen years. Eva Dahllof played on the tour and is still playing on the
tour. She’s a Swedish player. She was a very outstanding player here.
Robin Hood played on the tour. She was an outstanding player here at
OSU in the early years. She played out there on the tour. I’m trying to
think of who else. That’s who I can come up with right off hand.

Gill

Were there some players, not necessarily because they were great
players, but are there some personalities that stand out in your mind of
some young women that you really bonded with or were special for
some reason in your program?

Turner

Well, of course, all of the ones that I just mentioned. They were very
special to the program because they were winners, and Stephanie Martin
was a special player here at OSU. She won a lot of awards for OSU.
Let’s see, she won the Edith [Cummings] Munson Award, which was for
outstanding athlete and academic, and she won the NCAA Female
Athlete of Oklahoma one year, and she was an All-American. Very
outstanding player.

Gill

How many All-Americans did you have? I know you don’t know an exact
figure, but give or take in your career?

Turner

I don’t know. I don’t know.

Gill

Thirty, forty, fifty?

Turner

No, I don’t think that many, but eighteen, twenty, something like that. I
don’t know.

Gill

Going back to the Big 8 and the transition to the Big 12, first of all the
old Big 8. How many years did you coach in the Big 8?

Turner

Well, until ’97. I believe ’97 was our first Big 12.

Gill

Out of those whatever years, how many years did you win the Big 8
conference tournament?

Turner

Fourteen.

Gill

Fourteen out of about seventeen years or so?

Turner

Yes.

49

Gill

Wow.

Turner
Gill

Well, from 1977 to 1997 is twenty years, right? Nineteen years.
Pretty good record. The change to the Big 12 Conference, how did it
affect your program? What were the impacts of that change?

Turner

Well, it’s more competitive. We got a lot of the Texas schools in with
the Big 12 Conference, and it made it much more competitive.
University of Texas was always an outstanding program, and so it came
in and it was probably our number one competitor.

Gill

How about A&M? Did they develop a strong program?

Turner

Yes, they had a good program, but they weren’t as strong as University
of Texas.

Gill

How did you do in the Big 12 years?

Turner

I think we won the Big 12 championship while I was coaching, and I’m
not sure when that was.

Gill

In about three years, give or take, that you coached?

Turner

Yes, two or three years.

Gill

Still pretty good. What about academic performance of your players?

Turner

Had a lot of academic All-Americans. The female golfers were always
interested in getting their degree. Most of them got their degree.

Gill

What would you say your graduation rate was?

Turner

Well, I think it’d be very high. I don’t know what it was. Now, Val
Skinner did not graduate. She lacked like three hours or something when
she left school, but she was here four years. Almost everybody that
played was here four years.

Gill

As we talked about the men’s program a little bit, the success of the
men’s and women’s program, have they reinforced each other? Has it
been mutually beneficial to have strong men’s and women’s golf
programs?

Turner

I think so. I think the female golfers know that the men have been
successful, so it makes them—you know, if they don’t know anything
about the women’s team they know something about the men’s team, so
it helps.

50

Gill
Turner

Have the two programs over the years been generally supportive of each
other?
Well, I think so. I think the athletes are very supportive of each other.
------- End of April 15, 2010 interview -------

Gill

My name is Jerry Gill. Today is May 13, 2010. This is a follow-up
interview with Ann Pitts Turner on the campus of Oklahoma State
University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE
Stories Project which is part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research
Program. Ann, thank you for graciously consenting to a second followup interview from our first one. I appreciate you coming to Stillwater to
take the time to do this.

Turner

My pleasure.

Gill

Picking up where we left off, we were talking about your twenty-four
year coaching career and looking back. I want to follow up with this
question: in your opinion, over that twenty-four years, what were the
major changes in the women’s golf program? How did it change in
terms of quality of the athletes and maybe strength and conditioning
programs, recruiting, number of tournaments, facilities, things like that?

Turner

I think a lot changed from the time I started coaching in the fall of ’76
until when I ended coaching in June of 2000. One of the things you
mentioned was quality of athletes. With Title IX came more
opportunities for females to participate in sports, so it opened up
participation in high schools and the junior high schools and the junior
golf programs and all these things. So, from ’74 to 2000 you had a
generation in there of girls that got more opportunity, and they saw more
opportunity for being successful in a sport. It could lead to a college
scholarship, and so they took sports more seriously, especially the
parents. They took it much more seriously because that was a way for
their daughter to get a scholarship. And by the mid-’80s and early ’90s,
there were many, many Division I schools and Division II schools giving
scholarships for college education to female athletes in golf and all other
sports, so it made the quality of the athlete better. We had more choice,
lots more choice. Also, there was more recruiting of foreign athletes
because, actually, even with the quality of athletes coming out of the
United States, there weren’t enough. There were some very good
athletes, for instance, in Sweden and that’s where I had my foothold was
in the Swedish community. I think I recruited my first Swedish player in
’85. There were two of them, and from that point on, I had an in, you
might say, to the Swedish National Team and to the Swedish golfers
who were very well organized and very good competitors. They were

51

competing across the United States at different universities.
Gill

Ann, kind of moving sideways a little bit, how did you get that first in?
What motivated you to go to Sweden to look at Swedish players and how
did you make that contact?

Turner

Well, I didn’t go to Sweden, and what got me into this was I received a
letter from a player from Sweden. Her name was Eva Dahllof. I received
this letter, and I hadn’t been successful that year up to that point in time
recruiting in the United States and getting the players I wanted, and so I
thought, “You know, I really have nothing to lose here. I think I will
pursue this.” And so I called her and wrote her, and evidently I was the
first school to reply. She had sent out fourteen letters, she told me later,
and I was the first school to reply. She took me up on it and became an
outstanding player. I mean, it was just unbelievable the talent this player
had. I recruited two that year. I brought two in from Sweden that year
and it was just very, very interesting, and from then on, about every
other year or two or three I got a Swedish player.

Gill

Did you ever go over to Sweden and make some contacts personally?

Turner

Well, I went to Sweden for a Swedish seminar that was put on by Pia
Nilsson, who was the Swedish national captain over there. She was head
of the Swedish national team and she put on this—but this was late in
my coaching career. This was in ’97 or ’98, somewhere in there. I don’t
even remember when. It might have been in ’95, but that wasn’t to
basically recruit, but I did see players over there. Most of my recruiting
in Sweden was done by phone calls and letters and word of mouth.

Gill

And from former players talking to prospects?

Turner

Yes, word of mouth. It was a small group over there, and so they all
knew where everybody was going to school, and so they would talk to
the players and find out what they wanted to know about a certain coach
and a certain school and this type of thing. So, it was interesting.

Gill

I didn’t mean to interrupt you. You were talking about the change in the
quality of athletes.

Turner

Well, and that was the other thing. We got more funding and we had our
full scholarship limit funded to us. You know, fundraising was a big part
of my coaching. It was necessary to fundraise in order to participate in
the quality of tournaments we wanted to participate in because we
needed more travel budget. It’s hard to fundraise for scholarships
particularly, but you can fundraise for your operating budget, and so
that’s basically what I did. Our reputation improved, and we were

52

invited to the elite tournaments, and we tried to play in the best
tournaments available to us that would work in our schedule because
that’s what our players wanted to do. If you want to get quality athletes
you had to play in quality tournaments. That improved as we went on
and basically, we got full rights at Stillwater Country Club, so that
improved. Our playing availability of our practice area improved. We
had a lot of improvements.
Gill

Towards the end of your career, did you ever start working out at
Karsten?

Turner

Yes, Karsten opened up in 1994.

Gill

So, again, a really quality facility, going from Lakeside to Country Club
to Karsten?

Turner

Yes, and I liked Lakeside. I loved Lakeside. I thought it was an excellent
practice facility because you have to pick up your own balls. That makes
your quality of practice much better. You’re not so apt to just stand up
there and hit a lot of balls and not pay attention to where they go. Then I
liked the Country Club because it is totally a different kind of golf
course than Karsten Creek. So, we tried to play at both places. It was
nice in a town the size of Stillwater to have three places to play.
(Laughs)

Gill

I’m going to say strength conditioning, maybe not doing squats, but in
terms of strengthening core and other things, did that become more
prevalent in your career as you went on?

Turner

Oh yes. I always felt like they needed to work out. So, even from the
very beginning I had them running or doing something. A lot of it was
more on let them do it on their own and be honest about it, that type of
thing, but then I got into more organized strength and conditioning. I
talked about earlier we did stairs at the stadium, and I felt like that was a
very good workout in a short amount of time. I don’t care if you run
them or you walk them, it’s a workout. I didn’t care how fast they went
up because I knew by the time they got to the top they were going to be
working out. Then we’d do strength. That became very popular and is
still today.

Gill

Ann, you talked about international recruiting. What other ways did
recruiting change during your career? Did it become more intensive,
more competitive?

Turner

Well, you had to really get out there and be seen and be visible and be at
the junior tournaments and follow them and show them that you’re

53

interested and go visit in the homes and visit with the parents, and so it
was more competitive. Recruiting was more competitive because there
were more schools after the limited pool of quality athletes, so it was
more competitive. I have to admit that recruiting was not my favorite
thing to do because after traveling all year, I really didn’t want to travel
all summer. I had a family. I didn’t want to do that. So, I have to admit
that I was very selective in the tournaments that I went to and I didn’t
spend all summer out there on the junior circuit, so maybe it hurt me in
some ways not being able to get some of the quality athletes, but I never
regretted the people that I got.
Gill

Can we go back and discuss in more detail—we touched on some of it—
but the issues and early outcomes of folding women’s sports under the
athletic department at OSU. I think it began in the late ’70s and early
’80s and that period. For example, what were the concerns initially in
coaching women’s sports about being merged under the department of
athletics?

Turner

We were our own group when we were under Health and Physical
Education. We felt like maybe we had more say because we were only
worried about women’s athletics in our area. When we moved into the
athletic department it was men’s and women’s athletics under one
umbrella, and I think it felt like at first that we were there because they
had to take us. I don’t think the coaches of men’s sports were glad that
we were there. I think there was a little bit of anxiety about having to
share the funds and this type of thing, so I think when we went over
there and we merged into the athletic department, we felt like it was
going to be better for us, maybe that we would get more support, more
attention, more funding, all those kinds of things. It took awhile for all of
that to happen.

Gill

What were the perceived benefits of the merger from the coaches’
perspective?

Turner

I think that perceived benefits was that it was going to be upgraded from
being just women’s sports kind of like over here on the side, that we
were really going to be fully integrated as an athletic team and this type
of thing. Women’s golf was really going to be right there with men’s
golf, and women’s basketball was going to be thought of the same way
as men’s basketball.

Gill

Taken a lot more seriously and on a larger stage.

Turner

Yes, because the public didn’t understand women’s sports at that time. It
was under AIAW which is the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women. They didn’t know what that was. Everybody knew what the

54

NCAA was. Plus, they didn’t even know some of the teams we had in
women’s sports, and so by moving into the athletic department, we felt
like we’d get more publicity, more people would know about us, it
would be easier to fundraise with the help of the athletic department, this
type of thing.
Gill

Stepping back for just a minute, you were talking about being under
Health, Physical Education and Recreation. Was Betty Abercrombie
head of Women’s Intercollegiate Sports when it was housed over in
HPER?

Turner

No. Dr. George Oberle was head of the department. Now, Dr.
Abercrombie might have been his associate, where she kind of was with
the women’s. I don’t remember that so much, but I do remember Betty
Abercrombie, a great mentor for me over there.

Gill

Were there some actual or implied promises or benefits made to the
coaches in the women’s department when you were first talking about
merging?

Turner

I don’t know that because we had a women’s athletic director, Susan
Hall, and we wouldn’t talk with anybody as coaches.

Gill

You weren’t involved in the decision.

Turner

No, no. Not that I remember.

Gill

So, Susan Hall, before the merger, was hired as athletic director for
Women’s Intercollegiate Sports, and then when you moved over under
NCAA, she was still on the staff.

Turner

She was the women’s athletic director.

Gill

Was there any discomfort with the merger, from your perspective?

Turner

I think what I mentioned earlier is that you could feel the anxiety from
the men’s side. The coaches of men’s sports I don’t think were real
pleased that we were there because they felt like that was the beginning
of them having less because they were going to have to take care of us.

Gill

They were going to have to share, share resources with the women’s
program.

Turner

Right, and facilities and everything, so it made it a little different. You
know, you bring women’s basketball over there and you’ve got to share
the court and you’ve got to have basketball games, and there was no

55

sharing before that. (Laughs)
Gill
Turner

Volleyball on top of that?
Volleyball and gymnastics. So, there was a lot of—you know, we were
happy to be promoting our sports and happy to be having a place to
promote it on a better stage, we thought. If I remember correctly, I think
it bothered the coaches of men’s sports. You’d have to ask them, but just
all of a sudden you’ve got people coming into your place that weren’t
there before.

Gill

Taking that same question, fast forwarding to today or say towards the
end of your career, have most of these initial concerns been positively
resolved?

Turner

I think so. I think you can see that across the board. I don’t know if they
still have problems here at Oklahoma State, and I’m sure they do, but
you can look nationally when you see teams playing on television,
especially in basketball, men’s and women’s basketball. I think that they
are proud of their counterparts. I see that more. They’re proud that the
women have been successful.

Gill

How about participation by fans?

Turner

Yes.

Gill

TV exposure compared to what it was is just night and day.

Turner

Yes, but you can see, too, that some of the men’s coaches are supporting
women’s basketball and the women’s coaches are supporting men’s
basketball just by being there. I think it’s better, much better. Of course,
we’ve had how many years since Title IX went into effect?

Gill

Thirty-plus years.

Turner

Thirty-six years. That’s two generations.

Gill

It’s about time, right?

Turner

Yes. (Laughter)

Gill

Well, generally, what do you think has been the legacy of Title IX?

Turner

Oh, the legacy of Title IX, it opened up all kinds of opportunities for
women, not only in sports, in other areas, especially in universities
because they receive federal funds. Any place that received federal funds
could not discriminate on the basis of gender, so it opened up a lot of

56

opportunities for females. You know, when I grew up, I had no
opportunity for sports, just in gym class. That’s where we learned all
about sports. I had no sports offered to me. My sport was watching the
guys play, the boys. We followed our boyfriends around and watched
them play baseball and basketball and football and all that kind of stuff.
Tried to be cheerleaders and all that kind of thing, but now you have
young girls playing in Little League stuff from the beginning of six years
old just like the boys, all the way through and then maybe choose a sport
and go with that. You’ve got soccer leagues all over the place with girls
playing. Softball is huge for girls now.
Gill

Soccer is getting huge, too.

Turner

Yes. And basketball, golf. Tennis has always been out there for the girls
it seems like. I think Title IX was huge. You know, everybody says, “Oh
it would have happened anyway.” I’m not sure. It’s kind of like the right
to vote, you know. You have to push for some of these things.

Gill

Sort of the same question, but has it fulfilled its expectations of its
original advocates? Do you think it has come full circle from what we
anticipated it to be, the impact of Title IX?

Turner

Well, it took a long time because my perspective on this was the ’80s
were spent by groups fighting Title IX. They never won, but it was at a
standstill because there was always litigation and trying to get the
legislation and all this kind of stuff. It never worked. It never happened,
but there was a lot of time in the ’80s spent fighting. So, it kind of stood
still for a little while, but since then it’s just gone full force forward.

Gill

You mentioned this earlier, but I’ll give you a chance to respond to it
again. Do you feel that the women’s intercollegiate sports have achieved
parody with the men’s programs, or at least on the Olympic or
nonrevenue sports, if you throw football out of it and basketball?

Turner

Right, right. Well, I don’t know because I’m not there. I love women’s
sports. I’m really interested in women’s sports, and I’m really more
interested in women’s sports than men’s sports. I think the public is still
heavily more interested in men’s sports than women’s sports, but I think
the people involved in women’s sports are very, very good at what they
do. Parody, I don’t know. I don’t think so, probably, especially in
recognition and acceptance by the general public.

Gill

Following up on that, Ann, in your opinion, what remains to be done to
ensure an equitable relationship between men’s and women’s sports at
OSU and nationally? What’s the work that remains to be done?

57

Turner

Equal opportunity for women. I hate to say this, but when I was
coaching, 90 percent of the coaches for women’s sports were female
across the United States, and now at OSU we have one female coach.
That’s a little upsetting to me because I think that there’s a lot of very,
very qualified women out there that aren’t being given the opportunity to
coach because women’s sports has become such a big deal at
universities and there’s more opportunity for men to coach.

Gill

I hadn’t thought about that. What to do you think the mixture is
nationally now between men’s and women’s coaches in women’s sports?

Turner

Oh, it’s much higher. We’ve lost a lot of women coaches, and it starts, in
my opinion, with administrators. Almost all administrators, athletic
directors, are male, and you tend to hire like you. You’re more
comfortable. So, I still see that as something that needs to be really,
really worked on.

Gill

Good point. Let me change the subject for a minute. I know a
contentious issue for women’s sports through the years really has been
equal pay, fair pay for men and women coaching the same sports, for
example, men’s and women’s golf, softball, baseball, basketball, etc. I
know you were involved in a lawsuit against Oklahoma State University
concerning this issue, and we’ve talked about it a little bit before. Do
you feel comfortable in sharing some of your information with us about
that? For example, could you talk about some issues and circumstances
that led you to take action?

Turner

I’d be glad to. Never, never in my wildest dreams did I think that I
would sue Oklahoma State University for anything, and I can’t
remember the year. I think it was 1993 or so. I’d been through several
athletic directors and had always been working for a pay increase, pay
increase for all of our coaches, and talking about gender equity. I mean,
that was a huge subject for almost all of my coaching career was gender
equity. Well, the story I got every time, and you know, I believed them,
was, “Ann, it’s just really hard to increase your salary at such a big leap.
We just can’t do that because your base pay—we just can’t give you that
big of a raise. We can’t do that within our system.”
Well, I believed them for a long time, and I got to noticing that they
could really give people what they wanted to give them, that there was
no structure so much because I got to noticing male coaches getting a
big this or a big bonus or stuff like that, you know, just by watching and
listening. And I think it was in ’91 or ’92, somewhere in there, I’m not
sure on the dates. I know exactly when it ended, but I don’t know when
it began, but OSU hired a new coach of women’s tennis for much more
than I was making. [He’d] never been a coach, and I think at that time

58

we’d won twelve Big 8 championships or something like that. This
person had never been a coach and was coming in and making six or
seven or eight thousand dollars more than I was making, and I’d been
there fifteen, sixteen years. Well, that really upset me because I was the
lowest paid women’s coach, and I’d been there all that time, and our
teams had been very successful. So, I went and talked to the athletic
director about it. I was told to mind my own business.
Gill

Do you mind sharing who was the athletic director at that time?

Turner

Myron Roderick. And I thought, “Okay.” And it kind of bothered me
that I wasn’t taken serious there, and so I kind of let it go. Then I had a
new athletic director, and I worked with him: Jim Garner. Nice, nice
man. Understood my situation from the beginning, and every year I went
and talked about it and wanted a raise. And he did give me a raise, but I
wasn’t happy with the raise because I still was the lowest paid coach of
female sports. Of all the sports, I was the lowest paid and had been there
the longest and had really, in my opinion, the golf team had been the
most successful as far as bringing home Big 8 championships, AllAmerican recognition and different things like that.

Gill

You had what, a third-place finish at the NCAA one year?

Turner

Two.

Gill

Two third-place finishes?

Turner

So, I think I had just kind of had it up to my eyeballs, actually, and I
don’t know what prompted me to do this, but I called a friend of mine
that was an attorney and I said, “What can I do?” I said, “I’m just…”
And I’ll tell you why I got so into this at that point in time, now looking
back, was that I was looking towards retiring and wondering what in the
world was I going to live on. I was a single woman at this time and I
thought, “I’ve got to take care of my retirement, and I know that our
retirement pay is based on our pay.” And I was looking at that thinking,
how am I going to do this?
So, this was all in my mind. I thought about it a lot. So, I called an
attorney friend of mine just to visit about this and I said, “What can I
do?” and he said, “Well, get me some information.” So, I ran to the
library that very day and came over here and went up into the—because
everything is public record and I got years. I went back years, and they
printed it off for me. I had a big cart full of all of these books with all of
the pay of every coach and every person that worked in the athletic
department. (Laughs) I had it all right there. I went back several years. I
made copies of it and sent it to him. And he got back to me and said,

59

“Ann, I think you have a case here.” He said, “This is awful.” And I
said, “Well, what do I do?” He said, “Well, let me write a letter.”
Gill

What year was this, Ann?

Turner

I’m not sure what year it was. I think it was in early ’93. It might have
been in ’92. I think it was in ’92. It was in the summer of ’92. Okay, so
he’ll write a letter. Little did I know that once an attorney writes a letter
to the university, you’re done.

Gill

All dialog shuts down.

Turner

All dialog with the people that you really want to talk to. You have to
talk through your attorney. Well, I was just beside myself. I thought,
“Oh, my gosh.” But my attorney is a very good attorney: Stan Ward. He
lives in Norman but he grew up in Stillwater and has been a longtime
friend of mine, and his wife is a longtime friend of mine. Anyway, he
started writing letters back and forth to the attorneys at OSU. He always
sent me copies of the letters they sent him and they were just very
insulting, telling me why there was no way in the world that I deserved
to be paid any more, that I had… And I told my attorney, I said, “These
are just very insulting letters they’re writing.” And so it really kind of
angered me that they weren’t more appreciative (Laughs) of what I had
done for the last sixteen or seventeen years. I can’t remember how long I
had worked at that time, maybe fifteen, sixteen years.
And so anyway, it just went on, and we went on, and it went through
mediation and that didn’t work, and I had to sit there and listen to
athletic directors. By that time, we had no athletic director. We had an
interim athletic director, and I had to listen to what they were saying
about me. And I’ll tell you, that process opened my eyes because I was
legitimate, I felt like, in my complaint, but they were adamant that I was
just way off base and that what I was asking and talking about was just
not true.
So, through the years we went through all this, and so the summer of
’93, I’ll never forget this, I was at a recruiting tournament and I got a
call from my attorney and he said, “Ann, they’ve made their final offer.”
And I said, “Well, what is it?” He gave it to me and I said, “That’s not
anything!” I said, “That’s awful.” You know, I was just like, “That’s
what they’re going to offer me?” So, I said, “What do I do?” And he
said, “Well, the only next thing you can do is file a letter to sue.” I don’t
know what it is, but, anyway, you file a suit. I said, “Oh, let me think
about it.”
And so I left the tournament because I was terribly upset, and I went

60

home and hunkered down in my house and just thought about it all
weekend. I came to the conclusion that, you know, the only thing I had
to lose was money fighting it and my reputation, and I felt good about
my reputation, so whatever the other people thought about me, I didn’t
feel that way about me.
So, I called him on Monday and I said, “Okay. File it.” And he said,
“Now, are you sure this is what you want to do?” and I said, “Yes, but
can you wait until the very end of the day to do it?” Because I knew it
was going to be front page because he told me, he said, “Ann, there’s
always a reporter there waiting to see what has been filed.” And I said,
“Does it have to be in the paper?” and he said, “Well, it will be.” Well,
the very next day right on the front page was “Pitts Sues to be Paid Like
a Man.”
Gill

Are those exact words there?

Turner

I might be paraphrasing, and I was just devastated. I mean, I was just
devastated, so I didn’t go to work that day. I just couldn’t go in because I
just knew, you know, I mean, it was just—I had to work there all year.
So, this was in August of ’93, and we tried everything we could to try
and settle out of court, working with them. They wouldn’t budge on
anything, so we went through the process of getting ready for trial, and
the trial was in April of ’94.

Gill

Can you share what the results of the trial were, Ann?

Turner

Well, I’ve never been in a trial for anything, and it was just awful. I will
tell you this: it was a jury trial. We had eight people on it and in a federal
court. This was in federal court, and in federal court it has to be
unanimous. I had six men and two women on the jury, and my attorney
told me, he said, “Ann, this just does not look good.” He said, “If we can
settle, we need to settle.” And every day they came back with the same
thing, and I said, “I just don’t feel good about that. I want that jury to tell
me I’m wrong.” I said, “I’m willing to go all the way. I want that jury to
tell me I’m wrong on what I’m thinking here.”And so, six redneck men
and two women (Laughs) found for me, and it has to be unanimous. It
was filed under three laws. Equal pay, I did not win. At the time I sued,
it was extremely hard to win an equal pay suit. They’ve relaxed the
standards now. It’s much easier and I am so glad for that, but we filed
under Title IX and Title VII, and I won both of those. And what I won
was a five-year contract after negotiating. I mean, after the trial we had
to negotiate this. I got a five-year contract. I had never had a contract in
my life working for OSU, but I had to have five years because that was
the date of my retirement, and if you don’t reach full retirement then
you’re not going to get your full retirement. So, I knew I had to reach

61

that. I got retirement, and they had to pay my attorney fees, which was
huge. That helped me so much. I got a pay increase that I was satisfied
with, I wasn’t pleased with, but I was satisfied with, and it was more
than they were willing to give me in the settlement. And I got back pay.
Gill

For how many years back?

Turner

Well, I don’t know how far back they gave me, but they gave me a sum,
and I got some compensatory damages of some kind, a little bit of that.
So, that pleased me that that jury of six men and two women found in
my favor. Now, the university in the headlines said they won.

Gill

How did they determine that?

Turner

Because I didn’t win the equal pay suit. So, it’s always pleasing for me
to be able to tell the story because it never came out in the paper like it
really happened, and it never came out in the paper the reason it
happened, and all these kinds of things. But I will say, it was the hardest
thing I’ve ever gone through at that time ever. And you really find out
who your real friends are, real quickly. (Laughs)

Gill

I can imagine. Ann, it must have been tough. Now, you won the suit, you
got the pay, but now you’ve got to come back to work.

Turner

Yes, I worked all during it.

Gill

With the administrators that you had been on the other side of the fence
with, how did that work for you?

Turner

Well, you know, Jerry, I felt okay because I felt like I was right. And I
will tell you this, it took only a phone call for the softball coach to get a
substantial raise and only a phone call for the women’s basketball coach
to get a substantial raise, and that pleased me to no end.

Gill

And you put this into perspective. It wasn’t about equal pay. They said
you lost the equal pay, but in effect, indirectly, it really did affect equal
pay at OSU.

Turner

It affected pay. It didn’t become equal, but it increased it.

Gill

Interesting. The softball coach right after that.

Turner

Yes, and I’m tickled to death because one thing I know, if I had filed it
in conjunction with other coaches, I don’t think they would have gone to
the lengths that I went to. They would have opted out earlier because it’s
very hard. It’s very hard to listen to your counterparts say things about

62

you in depositions. I had to be at every deposition and sit right across the
table from the university’s witnesses giving depositions, and it was all
against me. It was very hard to look at them. I decided early on that I
wasn’t going to take it personally, that we were fighting for what we felt
like was right.
Gill

How did your fellow women’s coaches here and women’s golf coaches
across the country feel about it? Did some call you, and then did you
have conversations with your colleagues?

Turner

My coaches here behind closed doors gave me full support.

Gill

Behind closed doors?

Turner

I have to say that, and I can understand. They had to stay out of it. They
couldn’t—they had to stay out of it. They had to stay away from me,
openly supporting me.

Gill

Did this also impact other coaches across the country, do you think?

Turner

Oh, I think it did. I think it did, and it impacted other people at OSU. I
cannot tell you. I bet I’ve had a dozen calls since my lawsuit, since the
victory of my lawsuit, of people here, women here at the university
wanting to know all about it and telling me their story. And every time,
I’ve told them, I said, “Look, I can’t tell you what to do, but you have to
be sure you want to do this because it’s not easy. It’s tough and you’re
not going to feel good during this process, I’m going to tell you, because
they’re going to say terrible things about you.” And it happened. And it
happened here, and it happened in the media, you know. It was just hard.
It was hard to listen to that.

Gill

You talked about this protracted legal action, but it was more about
equity for women’s sports and equal pay for coaches in women’s sports
than about you, and yet you paid a high emotional price for your beliefs
and your values, the price for which you received some compensation,
but not near enough for what you had to go through. In retrospect, was
it worth it?

Turner

Yes.

Gill

Why?

Turner

Because I got validation from outsiders. I couldn’t get people that I
worked with to agree that we needed to make some changes and big
changes, but this jury that was so stacked against me got it. I think they
got it. I think they understood, and that made me feel better because, you

63

know, they had to listen to all the testimony. And they got it, and that
really—I just thought, you know, I felt so much better after that.
Gill

You indicated that you must have felt good too about the raises that
coaches of women’s sports at OSU got.

Turner

Oh yes.

Gill

Many thereafter.

Turner

Oh, yes. I felt really good about it. I was tickled to death.

Gill

Ann, did it impact in any way your coaching career? You coached in the
five years through…

Turner

I coached another six years, and that’s another story.

Gill

Okay, well, tell me the story.

Turner

Okay, my contract was for five years.

Gill

Supposedly the five years would have ended in what year?

Turner

Ninety-nine, and that was when I would reach the rule of eighty. I would
have been able to retire for full retirement, which I needed. After my
trial was over and sometime in late ’94 or ’95, Terry Don Phillips was
hired as our new athletic director. I’m not sure when that happened, but
my trial was, I think it was, the fall of ’94 when he came in, and I hadn’t
even settled yet. We settled in November. We hadn’t even come to the
terms of my contract and pay raise and everything even after the trial
until November, and we were getting ready to go back to court to settle
this, to have the judge settle it, and OSU finally came with an offer, and
I accepted it. They had me down for a four-year contract and I said, “No,
I have to have five. I have to have five.” Because I knew what would
happen. So, I got five and a raise, and so we settled it without going to
court, but that was at the last minute, very last minute. I was sitting in
my attorney’s office and we were preparing for court the next day, and
they called.
So, Terry Don Phillips comes in as the new athletic director, and I
discuss with him my situation and that it was never against OSU, and he
was an attorney. He seems to understand that everything is okay. Well, it
gets close to ’99 and I’m thinking, you know, everything is going good.
We have this new athletic director, and I’d like to work until I’m sixtytwo years old when I can get social security. (Laughter) And so I went in
and requested an extension and he wouldn’t give it to me. So, I was

64

going to have to retire in ’99, and that upset me. I thought, “You know,
come on. You’re new. You didn’t have anything to do…”
Well, anyway, that got out among my fellow coaches out there in the
United States and they were outraged by it, which pleased me. I felt like
they accepted me and respected me and wanted that not to happen, and
so a big huge article came out in Golf Week, the magazine of Golf Week.
This reporter had called me, and I gave her every name of the [OSU]
Regents, and she called every one of them. She wrote what they said
about it and put it in this big article in Golf Week, and she called Terry
Don Phillips, and his statement on the top of the article said, “A Deal is
a Deal.” That spring we had a reunion, and some of my players came
back and they went in and talked to Terry Don Phillips and the president,
Jim Halligan, and pleaded a case for me for coaching two more years.
Three of my former golfers went in there. Three former golfers at OSU
that I coached went in there and pleaded a case for me in the spring of
1999, and they gave me one more year. So, I coached until June of 2000.
Fought until the end, didn’t they?
Gill
Turner

Gill

Turner

Gill

They’re not going to give you everything you want, but anyway. You
know, during all this process, as I said, you find out who your real
friends are, and I found out who my real friends were here in Stillwater,
Oklahoma, because it was coffee shop gossip the whole time this trial
was going on. I found out who my real friends were out there in the
coaching ranks, and I found out how much respect some of my players
had for OSU and the time that they had here and all that kind of stuff,
and I really got a lot out of it, more than it hurt.
Ann, if you don’t mind me adding, a lot of people got a lot out of it,
benefitted greatly from what you did, not just yourself. That’s what it’s
all about.
I hope so. I hope so. It bothers me a little bit when I see that there’s not
any female coaches in the athletic department, but you know what? I did
what I could do, and I’m not there, and they’re doing what they can do.
So, we’ll see how it goes. (Laughs) But you know what? Everything
turned out. My belief is that things happen for a reason. I retired in 2000,
met my husband of today in 2001 and we got married in 2005. If I hadn’t
retired in 2000, I wouldn’t have met him in 2001, and I wouldn’t be
where I am today. So, things work out for a reason. (Laughter)
I know that was tough for you, Ann, I appreciate you sharing your story
with us. Thank you.
Well, I like to tell it. I like for people to know the real truth of what I

65

Turner

really did because people have written things and that’s not what I did.
An interesting thing came up. Can I tell this story?
Sure.

Gill
Turner

Gill

Turner

A former player was getting her master’s degree in sports
administration, taking a class in sports law, and she e-mailed me and she
said, “Coach, we’re reading about your case in the law book.”
(Laughter) She was here during that time, and she wrote a very, very
good letter, and the team signed it in support of me staying an extra year.
And I thought, “Oh no, I’ve made the law books.”
I should have asked the question earlier, how did all of this impact your
players and your coaching during those couple of years that were really
intense?
Well, I don’t think they really understood much about it until it came
time for the trial. I was gone every day and they knew it was happening.
It was in the paper every day and it was in the O’Colly every day. I don’t
think they really understood. I tried to explain it to them the best I could
afterwards, that I wasn’t against anything here at the university, that I
loved it here and all this kind of stuff, but I think they got it as time went
on and especially when it came time for me to be retiring. They
understood a little bit more. You know, their parents understood,
whether they were in my corner or not is something to be said, and
during recruiting in ’94 it was tough because it was nationwide. It was in
Golf World. It was in all the golf magazines. It was written up
everywhere.
Did it impact your career?

Gill
It was in USA Today.
Turner
Wow.
Gill
Turner

One of my players was reading USA Today and she said, “Coach, I read
about you in the paper today!” I thought, “Oh, no.”
That can’t be good, right?

Gill
Turner

Well, you never know how they’re going to write it. Because that’s what
I’m saying. It’s nice to be able to tell what really happened and how it
came down. It was truthfully by accident that I ever got to this point, but
once I got into it, I had to stay to the end. I just felt like I had to go, and I
don’t know where I got that from because I was by myself making those
decisions.

66

Gill

Turner

Gill

Looking back on your coaching career, not about the legal part, but in
your coaching career, is there anything you would have done differently
if you had a chance to do it over again?
Probably. You know what? I have a lot of contact with former players in
their thirties and forties, and what they got out of it is just wonderful. So,
I think I would have worried less about winning and success and more
about what they’re getting out of it and making sure that they got a
positive—I wanted them to have a positive feeling from being here, but
they have such fond memories and of so many things that I’ve even
forgotten, that they remembered, and that’s so pleasing. I love that. I
love it that they have good thoughts and want to come back and share it
and laugh, and they don’t remember the three putts and losing. I think
looking back that I would have maybe enjoyed the ride a little more
instead of being so intense about things.
Well, you were intense and you were successful, which kind of leads into
my next question, and think about this for a minute. What do you feel is
the legacy that you’ve left in women’s intercollegiate golf at Oklahoma
State University and nationally, because you’ve been involved in
committees and national organizations?
Yes.

Turner
Gill
Turner

I know you don’t just want to get up here and say what your legacy is,
but as you reflect back on it…
Well, I think my legacy nationally is better than the one at Oklahoma
State. I’m afraid that the legacy at Oklahoma State is going to be the
lawsuit, and, unfortunately, it’s not a good legacy from the people that
tell the story here. It was more like I was a troublemaker or—I don’t
know. Anyway, I would like for it to be a positive legacy. That we were
successful, that we had fifteen championship titles and we participated in
nationals, and we finished third twice, and we had a lot of AllAmericans, and we had some very successful tour players. Nationally, I
loved working for the betterment of women’s golf. I loved that. I worked
on the NCAA committee for ten years and I loved doing that.
And we talked about, you were in the AIAW committee before that.

Gill
Turner

Yes, yes, and I loved doing that. I love promoting women’s golf and
helping women’s golf succeed and all that kind of thing, so I think I
probably have a better legacy outside of Oklahoma State University, to
be honest with you. I have a more positive legacy. That’s what it is.
But then again, Ann, you may be a little hard on yourself. I mean, you

67

Gill

Turner

Gill

Turner

took a program that just was not there and you really built a national
prominence here at Oklahoma State University, and we’re still up there
nationally because of what you built. Surely you’ve got to think about
that legacy, as well.
I’m pleased that it worked out. I was given an opportunity. I wasn’t
qualified to be a coach. I was given an opportunity to do something I
never dreamed I’d do, and I had a wonderful time. I met so many
wonderful people and had so many wonderful players come through
here. Oklahoma State ought to be proud of the players that came through
here. They have such wonderful memories. So, I loved my coaching. I
loved what I got out of it, and I hope that my legacy at Oklahoma State
University is a positive one.
Looking back over your twenty-four year career again, are there some
special moments that stand out for you, special memories you have? I
mean, you gave a lot of good ones, but sift through them a little bit. Are
there some special ones?
That is so hard to remember. I’ve said before, I think winning our Big 8
championship in 1977, that first year, was so exciting. Looking back on
it, it is really exciting because it was something that we’d thought we’d
do, and we actually did it, and that was exciting. The travel was special.
I can’t think of special moments right off. I just can’t think of them like
that.
Are there some milestones in the program that you recall?

Gill
Turner

Gill

Turner

I remember winning our first Big 12, and I thought that was very special
because it came at a very hard time for me, and that was in ’99. I believe
it was ’99 when we won our Big 12 championship, and that had been a
very hard year for me because I was still trying to hang on to coach
another year, and that was very emotional for me to win that, and I had a
lot of support from the Big 12 coaches. I remember that a lot.
Another question I wanted to ask you, it must have taken an
unbelievable commitment and just an incredible amount of energy to
build a program from scratch like you did and to build a nationally
competitive and respected program and to maintain that level for
twenty-four years. How did you do that? What motivated you? What
sustained you to put all that energy and drive into it? Where’d the
passion come from?
I don’t know. I loved it. I loved doing it. I learned a lot from coaches
that had been coaching for a while out there. I think I spoke about that
much earlier, and I just knew we had to have players. You have to have

68

players come in. I couldn’t teach them how to play golf. I wasn’t a
teacher, so I had to have players, and it just depended a lot on recruiting
and getting the right mix, and I’ll tell you. I think all sports depend on
chemistry, and so I spent a lot of time trying to get them all to get along
and work together and this type of thing. It’s very important in coaching
females that you have good chemistry. It can destroy a team. Honestly,
I’ve had very talented teams here that had terrible chemistry, so we just
weren’t very successful, and I’ve had not such talented teams that had
great chemistry, and they just played so hard for each other. So, I don’t
know what kept me going, but it was very enjoyable and I loved my
work, and so it was something I enjoyed.
Gill

Reflecting back on our conversations these last two interviews, all the
coaching that you did every day and the recruiting that you did, the
administrative activities in the summer when you should have had time
off and yet you had a family at this time, two boys, it seems like some
folks would hit a plateau or burn out, yet you were able to keep going to
sustain that. With the other issues, the legal issues during the ’90s,
that’s just amazing. So, I guess the question I’m asking is what are your
genes? What is your background? Where did that drive and energy
come from?

Turner

I don’t know. That’s what is so interesting because I have reflected back
on me being a cheerleader, trying out every year in high school and
never getting it, and I came to OSU and tried out for cheerleader again
and got it, and why did I keep trying? I don’t know. I must like the
process, (Laughs) and I don’t know where that comes from. It must
come from my parents. I don’t remember getting that drive because I
never expected to be a coach. I never expected to even work. That
wasn’t something that women in my era were encouraged to do. You
know, my mother had been a homemaker. I was going to be a
homemaker. It just was by accident. All of this was by accident. So
many things were by accident, and I’ve loved it.

Gill

You said earlier, things happen for a reason.

Turner

They happen for a reason, and I just happened to be in the right place at
the right time to get this job. I had a lot of support from my family and
from people in the HPER Department, so, you know, you don’t do it
alone. You get support. There’s a lot of people out there helping you.

Gill

I’m asking you not to be modest now. Are there some special awards
and recognitions that have really been significant and special to you?

Turner

Yes.

69

Gill

Could you share some of those with us?

Turner

Well, I have received the Gladys Palmer Award twice in coaching. This
is for service outside and over and above coaching for women’s golf.
That’s not exactly how it’s written, but it’s for extra…

Gill

Contribution to society?

Turner

Contribution to women’s golf. I got that twice, and there are only two
people, I think, that have gotten that twice. I got it early in my career. I
think I got it in ’87 and then in ’99.

Gill

Was some of that maybe recognition of your efforts on behalf of
everybody else in the lawsuit, perhaps?

Turner

The second one was. I know it was. The first one was because of the
work I had done on the committees and with the computer program and
helping run the tournament and that kind of thing. I know that’s what
that was for. And then the second one was for my stand on gender equity
here at OSU. Those two awards, and then I didn’t get these awards, but a
player did. Stephanie Martin won the Edith Munson Award, which gave
the university $10,000, and she also won NCAA State Female Athlete
one year, and that was very exciting because those are very high awards.
And then I was inducted to the National Golf Coaches Association Hall
of Fame.

Gill

That must have been a great feeling.

Turner

It was great. And then recently I was inducted into the Women’s
Oklahoma Golf Hall of Fame in 2008 and that was very special for me.

Gill

I recall for the Big 8 and Big12 you were coach of the year several
times.

Turner

Yes, yes.

Gill

Do you remember how many times?

Turner

No, I don’t. That was fun.

Gill

National Coach of the Year Award?

Turner

Actually I don’t think I was National Coach of the Year. I was Regional
Coach of the Year, but I don’t think that I was ever National Coach of
the Year.

70

Gill

What a shame.

Turner
Gill

That’s okay.
So, after asking all these questions about golf, I’ve got to back up and
ask, is there life after coaching?

Turner

Well, yes. That’s what I’m saying. You know, when I retired in 2000 I
didn’t know what I was going to do, but I decided that I was going to
play golf and that I had watched golf for twenty-four years and I had
seen players not any bigger than I am play really good golf, so I started
taking lessons from a former player. I thought, “I’m going to improve.
I’m not going to continue playing this hacky kind of golf.” So, I went
and took lessons from a former player, really got into golf.

Gill

Do you mind saying who that was?

Turner

Janice Burba Gibson. And by accident, I met my now husband in 2001.

Gill

What was the accident?

Turner

Well, friends of mine wanted me to play in a couple’s tournament, and I
said, “I don’t want to do that. That doesn’t sound fun to me. Why would
I want to go do that? That just sounds awful,” because I had never
played with men in that kind of format. I had always just played with
women. And they said, “Oh, it’s so much fun. Come on, you’ll like it.”
And I said, “I don’t know. I have to meet this person first.” He lived at
Shangri-La [Resort] and they lived up there in Afton, [Oklahoma], so I
went to Shangri-La, and all four of us played thirty-six holes that day.
You’re in a golf cart for a long time when you play thirty-six holes
sitting next to the person that I was [supposed to play with] and I really
enjoyed him. I thought he was really a neat guy, but I didn’t think much
of it. He was an Oklahoma Sooner and I thought, “Ahh.” (Laughter)
Anyway, we started dating, and then we kind of split up for a year and
then we got back together, and we got married in 2005, and it has been
wonderful.

Gill

Great. Now, you’ve been involved with the Oklahoma Women’s Golf…

Turner

Women’s Oklahoma Golf Association. Yes, I served as vice president
for two years and president for two years.

Gill

Did you enjoy that?

Turner

I did enjoy that. Now I’m serving on the Women’s Golf Hall of Fame
Board and that’s my passion now. I love it. I love that and we work to
support junior girls and honor past individuals who have done so much

for women’s golf in Oklahoma.
Gill
Turner

I’m going to ask a personal question. How’s your golf game going?
It’s much better than it ever was.

Gill

What’s your average score? Can you share that with us?

Turner

Well, right now I have a nine handicap, so I can shoot anywhere from
seventy-eight, seventy-nine, to eighty-five, and that’s a good day.
(Laughter)

Gill

That’s good. Ann, how do you hope people remember Ann Pitts? I know
the lawsuit, in your mind, might cloud that. Just your life and your
career at Oklahoma State and your coaching and all the people that
know you and what you’ve done, the associations you’ve worked with.
How do you hope people remember Ann Pitts Turner now?

Turner

Well, I hope they remember me as being very passionate about women’s
golf and wanting it to be better and working in it and being exciting and
having a great interest, and I don’t know what words to put in there, but
I want them to remember me as being somebody that cared a lot for the
game and for the sport for women and worked to make it better.

Gill

And for the players, obviously, as you said?

Turner

Yes. I want them to know that we made it better for them. I always look
back—I didn’t maybe pay much attention to this when I was in history
class, but I look back on the women’s suffrage movement with great,
great empathy and sympathy for those women. They worked sixty years
to get the right to vote for women, which we take for granted today. I
mean, what loyalty, to work every year, and they were really, really
banished from society. I mean, they were not well-respected at all in
society for wanting to do that. So, I look back on that and I have such
appreciation for them, and I’m hoping that in sixty years somebody will
look back and have appreciation for Title IX and what it did for women.
It’s just a wonderful thing.

Gill

And what you did is part of that Title IX.

Turner

Well, I hope so. I was part of it. You know, there have been a lot of
women out there who have stood up for their rights. Not just me. A lot
of women. And it takes a toll on you. I will tell you that. It takes a toll. It
changes you a little bit. I tried not to let it change me. I tried not to let it
—I didn’t take it personally what people said about me. I didn’t want to
hold grudges. I wanted to come out of that with it over and not hold
grudges. It’s hard. I still have a very good memory about it, and so I can

72

be face-to-face with somebody, visiting with them, but I have a very
good memory of what they said about me. So, I don’t want it to cloud
my view at all because I love Oklahoma State University and I want it to
be successful, and I want the women’s golf program to be real
successful.
Gill

Tagging onto that question, do you help in any way with the women’s
golf program indirectly? I know you can’t as a non-paid person. Do you
still support the program in certain ways that you can?

Turner

I haven’t been involved with the program since I retired. When I retired,
Amy Weeks took over as coach, and she had been my assistant, and I
thought, “I’m going to back off. I’m not going to be there. She needs to
run the program the way she wants to. If she wants to ask me a question,
she’ll call me.” So, I really backed off, and I had more contact with the
program when Amy was in it than I did when the next coach came in
because she didn’t even know who I was. And so I really haven’t had
that much contact, and then in 2005 I moved away. So, I came back this
year for—they asked some of the alums, whoever could come back and
play in their fundraiser, and I came back and did that. It rained all day
and it was horrible, but that was fun. So, I’m going to try and support
them financially and be more of a support if they want it. I think that
once you’ve coached you just get out and let the next person do it.

Gill

Ann, what have we left out? Over two extensive interviews we have
probably wrung you out, but is there anything that you’d like to bring up
or talk about?

Turner

I don’t know of anything, but, you know, I’m sure I’ll think about this
all the way home and I’ll probably come up with something that was—
like you asked me some bright, shiny moments in my career and I can’t
even remember. I enjoyed all of it. I just don’t remember something
standing out as being more special than others. I really don’t.
