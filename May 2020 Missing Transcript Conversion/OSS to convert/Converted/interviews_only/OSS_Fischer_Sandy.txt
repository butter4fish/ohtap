Sandy Fischer
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Jerry Gill
May 13, 2010
Stillwater, Oklahoma
Gill

My name is Jerry Gill. Today is May 13, 2010. I’m visiting with Sandy
Fischer here on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,
Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project which is
part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Sandy, thank you
for taking time to come and visit with us. I appreciate you doing that.

Fischer

Oh, no problem.

Gill

I want to just tick off a few things here, Sandy, and these are just a few
of your accomplishments. You’re a legend in OSU softball. Twenty-three
year coaching career at Oklahoma State University, more than nine
hundred wins, nine conference championships, six College World Series
appearances, voted Midwest Region Coach of the Year five times,
National Coach of the Year in 1989, coached twenty-six All-Americans
and in 2008 you were inducted into the National Fastpitch Coaches
[Association] Hall of Fame.

Fischer

Yes.

Gill

Wow.

Fischer

I know.

Gill

Have I left anything out, Sandy?

Fischer

Yes, it’s been fun.

Gill

What a ride, but let me stand back a minute, though. First of all, kind of
start with the beginning. Can you share a little bit about where you grew
up, your family and some of your early life?

4

Fischer

Sure. I grew up in Quincy, Illinois, on a farm, small farm, and I had an
older brother and an older sister, and it was through the experience of
my older brother that I got into the sport of softball. We both belonged
to 4-H clubs. He was a softball pitcher for the boys’ team, and then I
helped create at the age of ten a softball team for the 4-H club I belonged
to and became the pitcher. So, it was through my association with my
brother and playing catch in the backyard that my love of the sport
began.

Gill

Now, you grew up on a farm? Is that right?

Fischer

Yes.

Gill

Did your dad also have another job other than farming, or was it pretty
much farming?

Fischer

It was a small farm, so he also was a school bus driver. He drove
morning and night, and then later on, my mother and father owned a
laundromat together and worked that along with the farm. Then later,
later in life my mother became a minister.

Gill

Your mother?

Fischer

Yes, at a Unity Church in St. Louis.

Gill

And, again, what church was it you said?

Fischer

Church of Unity, a small church in St. Louis, later down the road after I
graduated from college.

Gill

Wow, interesting.

Fischer

Yes, it was very neat.

Gill

You might have given me a clue here, but growing up were there some
principles and values that you learned that influenced you and
contributed to your success later in life?

Fischer

I think my mother instilled in me more a sense of wonder and possibility
about the world because if all things are possible, then you’re not narrow
minded. You don’t put things in a box or a square. You look at the world
with a wide open view, and, so, I appreciate that be it a plant blooming
or be it just some change in government or the universe or something. I
mean, there’s always a possibility about something, so it was a very cool
thing of philosophy.

5

Gill

Can you tell me about your other school or community activities there at
Quincy? Were you involved in other sports or other organizations?

Fischer

No, unfortunately growing up in my high school situation, we had no
sports. It hadn’t started yet. A little bit of intramural type of stuff, but I
played in the band and, you know, my mother wanted me desperately to
play the piano or do dance lessons or whatever. I had no interest. I just
wanted to be a farm girl and play with my horse and play softball. That
was pretty much what I wanted to do.

Gill

So, what instrument did you play, Sandy?

Fischer

I played the French horn and the flute, of all things. (Laughter) I know.
Marching band French horn, yes.

Gill

That’s great. Well, kind of going back to your farming experience, it was
a working farm, so I guess you got a pretty good dose of work?

Fischer

Very much so, very much a working farm. I got to plow the fields and
disc the fields and shock the corn and feed the pigs and do the whole
nine yards.

Gill

Got up early in the morning before school and chores after school?

Fischer

Oh, absolutely, yes. Bucket-fed the calves, that whole thing. So, yes,
very, very strong appreciation for the land and for the values and the
hard work that farmers do to feed us.

Gill

Sandy, getting back to your earlier comment about your older brother,
this is sort of a two-part question. Did your parents encourage your
participation in softball? Sounded like your brother did, for sure.

Fischer

(Laughs) Well, my brother needed somebody to catch. You know, he
wanted to practice. He wasn’t really a teaching kind of guy, but he
wanted me to help him, so he would pitch to me, and it would hurt,
actually. I mean, physically it was hard because he was very strong, so I
tried to throw it back as hard as I could, and so that’s how I learned to
pitch. My father was encouraging. He would come to the games. My
mother was more of a background person. She wasn’t really sure sports
were going to be good for (Laughter) women, but she was like, “If you
like to do it, then you need to go do it.” And, so, I did.

Gill

So, now, again the genesis of it—your brother played on the 4-H softball
team.

6

Fischer

Yes.

Gill

He pitched. So you decided that the girls should have a team.

Fischer

That’s right.

Gill

So, you helped organize that?

Fischer

I did. I joined a different 4-H club. I actually went incognito as a nineyear-old. You weren’t really allowed to join until you were ten. So, I lied
because I really wanted to start a team. (Laughter) I corralled all my
friends and neighbors that I knew that had played in the backyard and
different things, and I said, “You’ve got to join this 4-H Club because
we’re going to have a softball team.”
So, I went to the 4-H leader to ask him, and he said, “Well, no, we don’t
have enough people. We don’t have equipment.” And I said, “Well, how
about if I get a team? You buy us a couple of bats and some balls and be
our coach?” He just kind of laughed. I mean, I was nine years old. He
said, “Sure.” Well, two weeks later I showed up with ten girls, and away
we went, and he was stuck. (Laughter) He didn’t know anything about it.
You know we got our little t-shirts, and away we went.

Gill

Wasn’t it unusual? I can’t think of any 4-H clubs—I grew up in a small
community and had 4-H that didn’t have any sports teams associated
with it. Was that unusual?

Fischer

Well, the funny thing about it, I think, because we were in the rural
development area is if you got a bunch of kids together and they wanted
to play a sport, they found a way for you to do it. Our biggest problem
was that there were not age groups. I mean, today you play against an
appropriate age group. Then, I mean, at ten years old, I’m playing
against eighteen-year-olds, so it could have been extremely dangerous.
You had from age ten to eighteen to be in 4-H, and so anything went, so
any age went.

Gill

And you didn’t wear hard hats in that era?

Fischer

(Laughter) No, no, no, so it was crazy.

Gill

Well, was there any other school or community activities you were
involved in? You talked about the band a little bit and, of course,
working on the farm you didn’t have an opportunity to be involved in a
lot of things, but was there any community activity that you were active
in?

7

Fischer

Well, I worked part-time after school when I got to high school. I was in
medical records, and I filed records and things after school, so I missed
out on a lot of after-school activities. From there, I would go home and
help my dad with whatever he needed on the farm, and then it was dark
and time to study and do it all over again.

Gill

Start over.

Fischer

So band and orchestra and softball in the summers.

Gill

Well, obviously, Sandy, you were a competitive athlete at an early age.

Fischer

An early age, yes.

Gill

Well, what appealed to you about sports and why do you think you’re so
competitive? Where did that come from?

Fischer

You know, I think from my mother. I think my mom, in spite of the fact
that she later in life became a minister, was extremely competitive. We
played a lot of family board games at home in the winter for
entertainment and things, and she was a tough one.

Gill

She played to win, huh?

Fischer

Yes, and I wanted to go toe-to-toe, (Laughter) and my brother was
competitive. And, so, as a family unit, my sister was not competitive and
my dad not so much, but, I mean, we had some go-arounds with
Monopoly and all kinds of good things like that, you know. So, I think it
came from that.

Gill

How about some highlights of your 4-H softball career. What kind of
teams did you have in that?

Fischer

We always finished second in the county, but that qualified us to go to
state. We hardly ever had the hitters to do much at state, but I would
always get picked up, luckily, as the pitcher to go with the number-one
team. You were allowed to pick up several players.

Gill

Oh, okay, I see.

Fischer

So, I became a pick-up, often, to go with them to the state tournaments,
and they won it several times, so.

Gill

Your brother, you said you learned from watching him. Did he ever tell
you techniques of pitching because there’s some…

8

Fischer

A little bit.

Gill

…fundamentals to pitching that are very important.

Fischer

Yes, he showed me a few things, but he wasn’t that well schooled in it
either. He was pretty well self-taught, and so basically what I learned
from him was my motion. I copied his motion in pitching and different
things like that. Actually, you’ll find your pitches are—one will be more
natural than another based on your body positioning and things. So, I
learned some things, and then it was actually after I got out of college
that I finally found someone who actually showed me different pitches.
(Laughter)

Gill

That long? Mercy.

Fischer

It was that long, but I could hit my spots.

Gill

So, what year did you graduate from…

Fischer

From high school?

Gill

Quincy, is that where you graduated from?

Fischer

Quincy High School, 1970.

Gill

Nineteen seventy? Now, looking at your resume, I know you played at
Western Illinois [University].

Fischer

Yes.

Gill

Were women athletes “recruited” at that time?

Fischer

Not yet. I didn’t even know they had a softball team until I went to
Western. My brother had attended Western. It was an hour from home,
so it was a smaller school. I didn’t want to go to a big school, and so it
fit my profile for going to college.

Gill

So, again, if I understand, you selecting to go to school there didn’t have
anything to do with the softball necessarily?

Fischer

Yes. As an elective my freshman year, I took a softball class, just an
activity class, you know, an hour of credit, something fun to do, and I
was messing around with one of my friends before one of the classes
started. And the class happened to be taught by the softball coach which
I didn’t know at the time, and I was pitching on the sidelines, just
playing and having fun, and she came over to me and she said “I need to

9

see you after class.” And I thought I was in trouble (Laughter). The next
thing I know, I’m being told about their softball team and she would like
for me to try out and different things like that.
So, I actually kind of just fell into it there. Then by the end of my third
year of competition, which actually was the end of my fourth year of
school, I thought I was finished. I didn’t play as a freshman. I didn’t start
playing until I was a sophomore, so I thought at the end of my senior
year, I was done. I didn’t know I had four years to compete and had only
competed three, so I’m all sad.
I think it’s over, and coach comes up to me and asks me if I’d like to
play one more year because I had switched majors and needed an extra
semester. I said, “Well, I didn’t think I could.” She said, “Well, yes.”
And I said, “Well, I don’t know that my family can really afford more
than the last semester.” She said, “What if we give you a talent grant?”
and I said, “What’s a talent grant?” She said, “Well, it’s a form of a
scholarship for athletics, so we could pay your last semester with a talent
grant.” And that was the beginning of athletic scholarships there. So,
1975—’74-’75.
Gill

So, the four years you played, then, were? What years did you play?

Fischer

Actually, ’71 to ’75 is when I played.

Gill

Well, some highlights of your playing career, can you tell me a little bit?
You all did pretty well, didn’t you?

Fischer

We did. We did. I don’t know what our win-loss record was, but we
went to the College World Series three out of my four years.

Gill

With big schools? I mean, how many?

Fischer

Well, the big schools at that time in college softball were in the
Midwest: Northern Iowa, Southwest Missouri State, Illinois State and
Western Illinois. So the bigger, more competitive, more successful
schools, they came out of the Midwest. Then my last year, we started to
see Arizona State come in, and a few schools from the West were
starting to trickle in. Up until that time, the Midwest had been the real
hub for competitive softball.

Gill

Did you pitch in the College World Series games?

Fischer

Yes, three times, yes.

Gill

What kind of record did you have?

10

Fischer

I don’t even remember. I just know we finished in the top four, two out
of those three times. We finished fifth once, so we finished third, fourth,
and fifth.

Gill

And you won some and lost some?

Fischer

Won some and lost some, but we muddled through. It was double
elimination, so it was like forever you played. You actually just ran out
of gas more than anything.

Gill

Kind of had to tie your arm on after six. (Laughter)

Fischer

It was brutal.

Gill

Oh gosh. So, some other memories of your student experience at
Western Illinois?

Fischer

It was wonderful. Made a lot of friends. We traveled on a dime. It was
just one of those things that really brings a lot of people together because
you endure so much. And what I can remember was so strange was our
softball season couldn’t start until women’s basketball was over because
we wore their uniforms. (Laughter) So, we’re out there in these
sleeveless little short things, you know, in pretty cold weather, and they
really did. They had the one set of uniforms. And basketball didn’t start
until volleyball was over because they used the uniforms. And, so, it was
really kind of interesting how close they cut it financially because there
just wasn’t a lot to go around.

Gill

I guess you probably didn’t travel a long ways to games either, did you?

Fischer

No, but the other flipside of that that was interesting was that we had
three teams. We had the varsity, the junior varsity and then we had like a
sub-varsity. They were very much into participation but not so much into
spending a lot of money to travel very far for competition. So, we just
basically traveled around to other schools in the state of Illinois to play,
and we all went on the same bus. We put all three teams on a bus and
went.

Gill

So, your travel experience is you went on a bus, and what was your
lodging like?

Fischer

Oh, Lord. Four or five to a room, whoever was willing to sleep on the
floor, you know. Can you get a cot in that room? Is it big enough? I
mean, at least four to a room, sometimes five, you know. You’d have to
flip for who got the cot and who didn’t, you know, different things like

11

that. There was a lot of hardship, but I don’t think we knew any better
because we had come out of summer programs or pick-up teams where
there was no money anyway. So, to get something paid like your
education to play, we didn’t care if we slept on the floor. It didn’t matter.
We were just excited to be on the team.
Gill

Speaking of summer leagues, when you were playing in college, did you
ever play any summer softball? Were there summer leagues for college
or, I guess, adult league, you’d call it?

Fischer

Yes. We had a travel team in Quincy, Illinois, called the Quincy Jets,
and they got put together during my high school years. I was approached
to travel with them, and my mother was actually quite adamantly against
that. She thought that was a little dangerous, thought maybe I was a little
young to go out with what she deemed strangers on the road and do
different things. So, after a lot of talking and convincing, she finally let
me go, and so I did get to travel, and we went around the state of Illinois
and up into Missouri and Kansas and did some different things.

Gill

So, you continued to do that in college, then, and after high school, as
well, for summer league?

Fischer

Well, a little bit, not so much. There was a little bit of an age limitation
on there, so in the summers I worked. (Laughs)

Gill
Again?
Fischer

Again.

Gill

So after you finished there at Western Illinois, you played for the
Connecticut Falcons, is that right? In the Women’s Professional Softball
League from 1976 to ’79?

Fischer

Yes. It was interesting.

Gill

Can you talk about that career?

Fischer

Well, at the end of my senior year, there was rumor that they were going
to try and create a women’s professional softball league which was just
beyond me. I can remember standing on the field during practice going,
“If I could only get paid to play this sport, I would just be in heaven.”
You never, ever thought about coaching, none of that, and a friend of
mine said, “Well, why don’t you just submit your resume because
they’re going to do this?” I said, “Honestly, I’m not good enough to play
pro. I mean, there are so many good players out there.” So, she did it for
me, and I didn’t know it. So, she submitted my name and wrote out all

12

the information.
Gill

This was your coach?

Fischer

No, just a friend of mine, one of the athletic trainers who had taken care
of me. I had hurt my back one year and she said, “You need to do this.”
“I’m not that good,” you know. So, actually, I got a phone call. I had
been drafted. I didn’t even know my name was in the pot, so I was really
excited, but I had just gotten a full-time job as a program director at a
YMCA. My parents worked so hard to put me through college that I just
didn’t feel right saying goodbye to a full-time job I just got to go play
summer softball, so I said “No. Thank you. I’m excited, but no I can’t.” I
thought that was the end of it. A month later, I get another phone call
from a legend in our sport, a true legend in our sport: Joan Joyce. She’s
the best pitcher…

Gill

What was her name again?

Fischer

Joan Joyce.

Gill

Joyce. Joan Joyce.

Fischer

She’s the best pitcher that’s ever lived. She carries all the records, an
absolute phenom, and I had seen her play and her team out of
Connecticut. They were called the Raybestos Brakettes, and they won
many, many, many, many, many, many national titles in the amateur
women’s side of softball. So, she called me one day, and I about fell off
my chair. I was like, “Oh, yes. Who is this really?” (Laughter) “Who is
this? Who’s kidding around with me? Don’t kid around with me.” She
finally convinced me that it was her and that I had been traded since I
had turned down the pro team in Chicago.
They traded me to Connecticut. Now, that team I would want to play for
because I knew that team was really, really good. They really wanted to
play. So, I had this conversation with my mother, of course. Originally,
she said, “You know, it’s too risky, and we’ve got too much invested in
your college education.” And I agreed. I boohooed, but I agreed. Twenty
minutes later she called back, “Oh, go for it. You’re young. You’ll get
another job. If that’s what you want to do, go for it.” And so I did.

Gill

How exciting. So, you’ve got this one side, and then she calls back
twenty minutes later and totally 180 degrees.

Fischer

Yes, I was so excited I couldn’t hardly stand it. And I didn’t like my job
anyway, what I was doing, (Laughs) so I was giddy. So, I moved to
Connecticut and ended up playing with them for the four years that that

13

pro league was in existence, and we won it all four years.
Gill

And that’s where you learned to pitch?

Fischer

Well, that’s where I learned the mechanics of pitching was from a
legend, which was Joan Joyce.

Gill

Wow.

Fischer

I started out just as green and nervous and bad. I was bad the first couple
of months until she convinced me I was good. There was this transition
in me of confidence and the ability to learn some things and apply them,
so it was really a good thing for me.

Gill

Did you play a position as well as pitching when you weren’t pitching?

Fischer

Not so much. No. I tried in my younger years to try to play some
outfield, etc. I just never was fast enough. I was a pitcher. I hit a little,
but I was a pitcher.

Gill

So, you pitched for four years in the league. Do you remember what
your record was? Seems like it probably progressed, as you were telling
me, and got a little better as you went along.

Fischer

Yes, actually we had four or five pitchers on our team, and we played
one hundred to one hundred and twenty game seasons.

Gill

Wow.

Fischer

I had three out of four seasons that were over-twenty-win seasons. I
know that, and twenty and four, and twenty and six, but good enough to
get us where we were going.

Gill

So, how many teams were in that league?

Fischer

The league started with ten, and then it went to eight because some
failed financially, and then it kind of went to six. It was just a hard thing
for them to last. And then in the very, very end, the last year, we were
actually down to four teams, but our team survived because we were
owned by sports greats. Our ownership came from Billie Jean King,
Martina Navratilova and Sally Little and some other pro golfers.

Gill

Wow.

Fischer

And so pro golf and pro tennis—Joan Joyce had met them on the series
—what was that series? Battle of the Stars or whatever, superstars series

14

on TV where they had female athletes competing. So, she met them
there and they started talking philosophically why our sport hadn’t gone
pro, and the pro league was born out of those discussions with other
professional athletes.
Gill

What would be a typical attendance for one of your home games?

Fischer

One of our games? We were in Meriden, Connecticut, so it was a
midsized community. So, our home games, we’d have a thousand
people, fifteen hundred people maybe, and on the best nights probably
two thousand, but during the week or week night, that kind of thing, five
hundred to eight hundred, probably.

Gill

Do you remember some of the other teams in the leagues?

Fischer

Gosh, we had teams in St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, up in
New England, Buffalo, New York, of course in Connecticut. We had
San Jose. We had a team up in Edmonton, Canada, down in San Diego,
so these teams were all over the United States.

Gill

You did some pretty extensive traveling, then.

Fischer

We did. When we started out, when we had either ten teams or eight
teams, we would just travel in our half of the country and kind of contain
it and then do one trip to the West Coast and that kind of thing. We
traveled a lot by bus and by vans. We flew occasionally.

Gill

Could you live on the salary that you were paid? I mean, do you
remember what your salary was?

Fischer

Oh, yes. Sure. (Laughs) I thought I’d hit it. Twenty-three hundred
dollars for the summer.

Gill

A summer?

Fischer

Yes.

Gill

Not a month. A summer.

Fischer

No, for the whole summer, but they paid our apartment. We had to pay
our own food, but they gave us a place to stay at twenty-three hundred,
and I thought I’d hit it. I thought I’d hit the jack pot. (Laughs)

Gill

What did you do in the off-season, then?

Fischer

Well, in the off-season, because I had quit my job, I decided to go to

15

Michigan State and pursue a master’s degree in intramural
administration. It was one of the two universities in the country. I
wanted to be close to sports, so I thought if I became an intramural
director at a university, then I could do some good that way and have
some fun and it would be a fun job. So, I went there to get my master’s
degree in the off-season, and that worked out really well.
Gill

Some kind of small stipend for you there, as you were working on your
graduate program?

Fischer

Well, I paid my own way for the first semester, hoping to land a
graduate assistantship. I did get one in intramurals, but it wasn’t enough.
Then at the end of my first semester, I thought, “You know, I’m not sure
I can do this financially,” because it was out-of-state tuition and all of
that. So, I was actually planning on leaving and trying to get back there
someday, but I couldn’t afford it. So, I have packed. My car is packed. I
have given up my apartment.
I’m at the last day of my job at the intramural building, and a softball
player walks by. Now, this is four thirty on a Friday before Christmas
break. She just waves and says, “I’ll see you next semester.” And I said,
“No, I have to leave. I can’t afford to stay, but I’ll be back.” She said,
“Well, we need a coach in softball. We need a pitching coach. Didn’t
you know that?” I said, “Well, no, I haven’t been a part of your team. I
don’t know that.” “Well, Coach is still in her office. Let’s go.” So, we
ran over across campus to the softball coach’s office, and this is twenty
minutes before the university closes down (Laughter) for Christmas
break.

Gill

And the coach is still there. Amazing.

Fischer

She’s still there. Amazing. Amazing. And I said, “Do you have an
opening, because I really need a graduate assistantship to stay?” She
goes, “Oh my God, yes. I need a pitching coach. She just quit!” So, long
story short, that’s how I got into coaching, and I was hooked. And I was
hooked.

Gill

I know you’re trying to kind of get to the season, so, the spring when
you’re a coach with Michigan State.

Fischer

Michigan State. Yes, assistant coach at Michigan State.

Gill

When did your pro season begin? Did it overlap with the spring season?

Fischer

Very little, very little. So, we were done there middle of May. The pro
season we had to report by the third week of May to get going. Our

16

season started the first of June.
Gill

So, dove-tailed pretty nicely, then.

Fischer

Yes. It fit pretty well.

Gill

So, did you do that two years, then, as a graduate assistant coach?

Fischer

Yes. Assistant coach at Michigan State for two years. And then I went to
try to find a job. I mean, after I graduated, it was like, “Now what?” It
was all cool and dandy, (Laughter) but now what? So, I went to a
convention where physical educators were and started just filling out
applications and putting them in the slots at this convention. I noticed
Oklahoma State had a job opening for teaching and becoming a softball
coach.

Gill

This was in ’78?

Fischer

Yes. So, I stuck it in the slot, and then I saw the University of San
Francisco had one for softball and a volleyball assistant, so I stuck it in
the slot. I didn’t know anything about volleyball, but I stuck it in the
slot. So, I did that five or six times, and I would come back and check to
see if anyone wanted an interview, and I really, really was interested in
Oklahoma State. Small town, that kind of thing.

Gill

So, this is at a conference, now, and so they had these little boxes so
coaches, then, from those schools, or administrators were coming…

Fischer

Administrators.

Gill

…and checking their boxes periodically.

Fischer

Yes, and they could interview people right there. They had little
interview rooms.

Gill

Do you remember who the OSU person was you talked to?

Fischer

Susan Hall. Now, what happened was I never got an interview with her.
She never responded. All my stuff was still in the slot. I put a new one in
every day. I got the call from University of San Francisco, and they
wanted to hire me on the spot. They just thought it was cool I’d played
the pro thing and all of that. I did not want to live in downtown San
Francisco. I was a farm girl, but I was like, “Well, this is the only job
being offered because Oklahoma State has not responded.” So, I left
there with a job, but I was devastated until I’m in the lobby. I’m packed.
I’m leaving and a friend of mine comes…

17

Gill

This sounds familiar now. This is twenty minutes before school is out
and the other job, and now you were leaving. (Laughs)

Fischer

I swear on my mother’s bible, this is true. A friend of mine grabbed me
and she said, “I found the woman from Oklahoma State. She’s over there
checking out.” And I was like, “What?” She said, “Come on.” So, she’s
dragging me over and introducing us, and she’s like, “Oh, I’m so sorry I
never got back with you. I meant to call you, and I was going to call you
when I got back because your resume looks very interesting to us.” She
had been spending most of her time partying, and so she was just going
to take the information home and make the phone calls from here.
(Laughter)

Gill

Knowing Susan…

Fischer

Yes. After I got to know Susan, I totally understood it all. (Laughter) So,
she had been in the bars having some fun at convention, (Laughter) and
I’m just dying to get an interview. So, anyway, she did call afterwards
and did fly me in for the interview, and the rest is history. (Laughs) I had
to take a cut in pay from San Francisco, though.

Gill

So, you went back home, I guess, or to wherever, to Michigan State.

Fischer

Yes.

Gill

Then how long between the time you met Susan there at the conference
until you came back for the interview?

Fischer

Oh, probably a week or two.

Gill

So, this would have been in the spring, summer of ’78?

Fischer

This was summer of ’78. I came in for my interview, and the job was for
part-time teaching and part-time coaching. So, I had to interview with
Dr. Oberle.

Gill

So, your professional season was over at that time?

Fischer

Well, I took some time off.

Gill

Took some time off?

Fischer

You know, they would let you do that.

Gill

Oh, okay.

18

Fischer

I come in for several days, and I interview with Dr. Oberle.

Gill

George Oberle, head of the Health and Physical Education Leisure
[Studies] Department (HPELS)?

Fischer

Yes, and that part was very nerve wracking for me because I had no
teaching experience. I mean, I only had coaching experience. I thought
he pretty well held the key to it, which I think he did in the long run, but
I think he felt comfortable enough after the interview that it was going to
be okay. Then I spent my time interviewing on the athletic side and
meeting the folks then.

Gill

Do you remember some of the people you interviewed with?

Fischer

Golly. It was mostly Susan. It was mostly Susan, but Polly McCormick
was there. She was one of Susan’s secretaries, and, gosh, I can’t even
remember. I’m having a blank. It was so long ago.

Gill

Was Dick Young there as athletic director at that time?

Fischer

There was someone maybe before him, or maybe Dick was there.

Gill

But was anyone involved from the athletics department side, or is this all
for HPELS side, your interviews?

Fischer

Mostly HPELS. Mostly, because I don’t think the coaching part was that
important to them at the time. I think the teaching was much more
important, and I think athletics were just starting to gain some credibility
for women on that side. But it was interesting. We had no softball field
at the time I was hired. We had an open field. We had no softball field.

Gill

Let me move back and ask you. What do you remember about the
structure? We were talking around the edge of it a little bit, but when
you got there in ’78, what was the organizational structure for women’s
intercollegiate athletics?

Fischer

It had already been planned to split, you know, between athletics and the
HPELS. They were already planned to split, so I arrived during, kind of,
the transitional year. My first office was over in the Colvin Center with
PE. I taught over there. Everything I had was over there, and then the
following year I got an office over in Gallagher Iba Arena and we made
the split. The offices were moved, etc. It was really in that transitional
time that athletics became its own entity.

Gill

But your first year there, was it still under HPELS, that ’78-’79 season?

19

Fischer

Yes, they were transitioning at that time.

Gill

What appealed to you about the position, because certainly we barely
had a softball program, as I recall, sort of a name only, played maybe a
few teams around the state. So, what appealed to you about the
position?

Fischer

What appealed to me was the community, was the fact that this was in
Oklahoma, not that far from Illinois. It was rural, but it was a big-time
school, and I was comfortable in this community, and the people I met
while I was here were very warm and welcoming and very, very helpful.
So, I really enjoyed the people. That was a big part of it, and then the
challenge of developing a softball program that they were kind of at a
point of, “We’re going to keep it or not keep it. We’re not very
successful. We’re not happy with where we are.” It was very challenging
for me. I like challenges, but on the other hand, I’m scared to death. I
had no clue if I had the know-how. I was a pitcher, you know. I had to
learn how to teach all of the other positions.

Gill

When you were at Michigan State, you were just a pitching coach, and
that’s what you knew.

Fischer

That’s right. That’s what I knew, and pitching is what I did. So, I had to
learn footwork on a double play, and I had to learn hitting techniques,
and I had to learn all of that. And I learned all of that by playing in the
pro league and picking minds and brains and asking lots of questions
from other people on the team that were already high school coaches or
whatever. Then I would keep books and just, I would learn. I felt like a
sponge.

Gill

Sandy, kind of expanding on that, you actually played one more season.
You played in ’79 with Connecticut in the professional league?

Fischer

Yes.

Gill

So, OSU’s season was over your first year. Then you played one more
year of professional ball, so that’s what you’re saying. You took
advantage of the extra year to learn from the professionals.

Fischer

Yes. And, see, we were only on ten-month contracts here, so we weren’t
even paid in the summer. So, I had to work in the summer, and when the
pro league ended, I was like, “What am I going to do for two months?”
So, I ran a fireworks stand for several years (Laughter) in the off-season.
I begged to be on a twelve-month contract, but I didn’t get one for three
or four years.

20

Gill

Well, now, you said you took a cut in salary when you left? (Laughter)
Was it the professional team, you made twenty-three hundred a
summer?

Fischer
No, I took a cut in salary by not taking the job in San Francisco.
Gill
Oh, San Francisco, that’s right.
Fischer
Yes.
Gill
So, do you recall what your starting salary was?
Fischer
Oh.
Gill
Do you mind sharing that?
Fischer
Yes. When I was a program director at the YMCA, that was nine
thousand a year. Nine. And then when I got the offer from San
Francisco, it was fourteen. I was just like, “Wow! That’s great.”
Gill
What are you going to do with all this money?
Fischer
What am I going to do with all that? When Oklahoma State came along,
they offered me ten, and master’s [degree] required. Ten thousand
dollars a year, ten-month contract. I was like, “Oh.” (Laughter) So, we
negotiated and got it up to eleven.
Gill
Oh, tough negotiator.
Fischer
(Laughs) So, I started out at eleven thousand dollars, master’s required.
Then after I signed my contract, I was just doing some research, and I
had to deal with Gary Ward with baseball for practice facilities in the
winter and stuff. I said, “So, where’d you get your master’s?” “I don’t
have a master’s.” “They don’t require you to have a master’s and you
make all that much more money than I do? This is a problem.” So, I got
my feathers ruffled pretty early (Laughter) by what I was required to
have versus the baseball coach.
Gill
Well, kind of getting back to the position condition of the softball
program when you got there. First of all, they had a program, but they
were playing a very limited schedule, playing pretty much teams around
the state, some adjoining maybe, but a limited schedule.
Fischer
Right.
Gill

21

And, again, tell me about the facilities, now, where you played.
Fischer
Well, when I got here I asked Susan to drive me past the softball field,
so she drives me past the corner of Duck and McElroy, and it’s just a
field. I mean, just dirt, grass, there’s no structure, and she said, “That is
where your softball field will be.” I said, “What do you mean ‘will be’?”
And she goes, “Well, we don’t really have one yet, but we feel that we
will in a year. At least we’ll have a skinned-in field and a backstop for
you in a year.” I was like, “What?” She goes, “Well, we couldn’t skin it
because we also had women’s field hockey playing there.” I said, “So,
where does softball play?” and she said, “Well, it’s at a city park.”
So, we played at a city park. We didn’t schedule any home games,
really, the first year. We went on the road, and so that’s how that facility
started. The original softball field was forty thousand dollars which was
huge money at the time which gave us two dugouts, if you want to call
them that, and a backstop, and that was pretty much it. We had one set of
temporary bleachers that we would move in from other sports.
Gill
Was that in the same location where the current stadium is now?
Fischer
Yes.
Gill
Well, Sandy, I want to get back to when you arrived. It was really a
transitional period for women’s intercollegiate athletics. As you
indicated, it had been in the department of physical education, HPELS,
Health Physical Education Leisure [Studies].
Fischer
Yes, it’s a mouthful.
Gill
Yes, but anyway, at this point we were transitioning under the umbrella
of the athletics department. Also, women’s intercollegiate athletics, the
governing body, had been the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women, AIAW was transitioning into NCAA. I’d like to ask you a couple
of questions along those lines if you don’t mind, get your thoughts.
Fischer
No, that’s fine.
Gill
What was the administrative status in women’s sports relative to the
athletic department? You were under HPELS, and then you had an
athletic director for women and that was Susan Hall.
Fischer
Yes.
Gill
So, the coach reported to Susan. Okay. The transition was in ’78-’79,
’79-’80. What was the feeling? How did coaches and supporters of

22

women’s sports feel at that time about transitioning from HPELS to
intercollegiate athletics department?
Fischer
I was so young and didn’t know the other coaches that had been here,
already established, really didn’t understand their feelings or know them.
I was just trying to learn my sport and figure out how I was going to
coach this group of kids.
Gill
And where your fields were going to be.
Fischer
Where my field was going to be and all of that. So, what I remember is
that, you know, the AIAW was a very strong organization for women’s
athletics. Then we had the men over here, the NCAA, and that there was
animosity about the NCAA. You started hearing all of the rumors, how
the NCAA wanted to take over the AIAW and bring all the women
under NCAA. The AIAW people were very, very progressive and were
doing a very good job with their association for women. In fact, we had
fifteen scholarships under AIAW, and then as we’re getting closer to
getting absorbed by the NCAA, the rumor is we’re going to go in our
sport from fifteen to eleven.
To me, it’s a total slide backwards and so being absorbed by the NCAA,
I didn’t see as a positive at all. I didn’t see it as a positive at all. The
AIAW, the women involved in coaching at that time, were very antiNCAA. A lot of them were, not all, but a lot of them were because the
NCAA kept throwing you the bones, you know, “We can pay for your
travel to the championships, we can do this and we can do that.” But to a
lot of us, it was a slide backwards at the time.
Gill
Kind of breaking it down to two parts, locally Oklahoma State
University was moving from HPELS to the department of intercollegiate
athletics. Dick Young was hired as athletic director, I believe, in August
of ’78, about the same time you were getting there. Many people felt that
one of the reasons Dick was hired was because of his experience having
been at Bowling Green University, his previous job, merging the men
and women’s program under the umbrella of the athletics department.
In your opinion, how supportive was he of women’s sports, and was he
effective in managing that merger, do you think?
Fischer
Well, you’re talking to someone who was quite young. (Laughter) At
that point in time, I thought equality should abound. I did. I felt like my
program should have equal access to a lot of things. I think Dick Young
probably, overall, did a better job than what I remember. I only dealt
with him with my sport, and I thought we could’ve, would’ve, should’ve
had more.

23

For example, I needed an assistant coach right away, and I wanted a
small stipend, a graduate assistantship, something, to hire an assistant
coach. He said, “Well, Sandy,” and I’ll never forget this. (Laughs) “I
guarantee you that there is a volunteer in this community, a housewife or
someone who would give you that expertise, and assistance, for free.”
(Laughter) Okay, well let me just tell you how that set in my soul. I
mean, really, seriously. I’m looking at baseball, who doesn’t need a
master’s. He’s got two assistant coaches, you know, and you’re telling
me to go get a housewife? You know, so (Laughter) we probably got off
on the wrong foot. On the other hand, he did say, “If you are successful,
then at some point in time very soon we will be able to substantiate your
needs, get you a full time assistant coach,” etc., etc. So, it took time.
Gill
How long did it take to get that assistant? Two years?
Fischer
(Laughs) Several. Several.
Gill
Then you brought in—is that when Margaret Rebenar—you had played
with her in the professional league? Is that right?
Fischer
Yes, and Margaret and I had been teammates, and she came for three
thousand dollars.
Gill
Wow. (Laughs)
Fischer
And was a part-time assistant. Then we finally got her bumped, after
three or four years, up to nine thousand dollars, three-quarter time, so
she could get benefits. So, in all actuality, it probably took five years, six
years, to get a full-time assistant.
Gill
Were there some noticeable changes in the sports program immediately
after the merger that you could, on a positive note, refer to?
Fischer
Well, I didn’t know the program before because I was in the transitional
year, so my point of reference would be different than another coach that
actually was here several years before the transition started. All I know
is we didn’t have a big budget. We didn’t travel far, and I knew that if
we were going to be any good, we were going to have to get out and
compete, and I didn’t know how we were going to do it. We may not eat
well, but we were going to have to travel. Drive the vans and get to some
competition because you can’t get better unless you compete, so that was
my main focus.
Gill
In your opinion, were the women’s programs stronger after the merger?
Now, I’m not talking about twenty years down the road, but even, say,
three, four, five years later. Were they stronger after the merger, do you

24

think, than they were before?
Fischer
After the merger of the men and women’s athletic departments?
Gill
The men and women’s athletic departments together.
Fischer
I think probably they were, in a way, because we were now merging
resources and we were now getting different sets of expectations about
winning. You can’t win unless you are supported in some way,
financially, scholarships, travel, that kind of thing. So, there was some
more of that that came along, probably, but the AIAW was an extremely
competitive association. I always saw them as very, very progressive.
I always kind of saw the NCAA as the enemy of women because we’re
doing really well over here. I think the NCAA feared the AIAW was
going to grow into an entity that would challenge them or be bigger than
them in some fashion, and they wanted us all under the same umbrella.
Gill
I want to come back to that, but I want to ask you a follow-up question
about the merger. After it took place, was there more interest in the
enforcement of Title IX? Do you feel like the merger would bring the two
together, fold them together, whatever you want to call it (I’ll say
merger; I’ll use that word) but bring in the women’s intercollegiate
athletic programs under the umbrella with the athletics department with
the men’s sports? What do you think the impetus for that was? Was that
more Title IX, or was there other issues involved in that decision? I
mean, what was the force behind that merger?
Fischer
I think the force was separating athletics from the educational side, the
teaching, and that kind of thing. This is an entity over here. We have our
sports teams, and we’re going to have a department that services our
sports teams, the educational side, the academics, the health side, the
athletic trainers, that kind of thing. We’re going to have an entity here.
We’re going to have to raise money through football and basketball, so
our focus became athletics because we were athletic teams separated
from the educational side of teaching.
Gill
George Oberle and HPELS and some of the other administrators, you
think they viewed that as a positive thing…
Fischer
I do.
Gill
… to spin off, if you will, the intercollegiate sports?
Fischer
Yes, because they could both now focus on really what their priority was
instead of trying to merge the two. I don’t know if there are any

25

departments left that were merged. University of Arkansas was merged
until recently, still, and I don’t know at what point they finally separated.
It took some schools a very long time to separate. So, I think it was a
progressive move to separate, and at the time we remained AIAW in
NCAA. We still got to function in our own little worlds and entities
before the merger completely to NCAA.
Gill
Kind of back to the Title IX question, thinking about Title IX on a larger
scale than just OSU, nationally, what would you say has been its legacy,
and has it fulfilled its expectations for its original proponents?
Fischer
I think Title IX is still a work in progress. I think that, for us, until we
challenge some things by using the law of Title IX, athletic directors
were still wanting to give you as little as possible to be successful
because it was an investment, and we didn’t have a lot of money in a lot
of situations. So, as you went down the pecking order, women’s
basketball was always held in high esteem. Athletic directors always
took women’s basketball, and it was the example, so they got the money.
They got the full scholarships. They got the higher salaries, and then the
rest of us kind of split this little pot (Laughs) over here. And I don’t
know why it was that way, but it was that way.
When Title IX came along, it wasn’t just immediate that we started. And
then Title IX got challenged in the courts, so it gave athletic departments
the ability to not really keep investing vigorously because they didn’t
know if the law was going to be overturned. So, there was this lull. And
the early ’80s was like, “Hmm, is it really going to happen?” and, “Do
we really have to go by these standards?” There was a lot of foot
dragging during that time until it was challenged and upheld, so that
became a turning point for us.
Gill
And, of course, obviously a lot of progress has been made the last few
years. Is there still work to be done, in your opinion?
Fischer
I think there is, but I think Oklahoma State is doing well. I think on a
national scale, there is lots of work to be done, particularly in the smaller
schools, high schools, that kind of thing. I don’t think there is equity at
all in a lot of those situations. We had recruited a young lady out of
Alabama, and her father had done some Title IX work. He was a lawyer.
And so when she came onto the team, he was in my ear like this, you
know. (Laughter) He was like, “Facilities, locker room, equal time in the
weight room, the time of day you have to practice in the winter versus
baseball, salaries…” I mean, it just went on and on and on, and he’s like,
“Sandy.” (Laughs)
Gill
Sandy, perspective to asking how, you know, the women’s coaches felt

26

about going in. How did the men, the coaches in the men’s sports and
supporters of the men’s programs, how did they feel about merging
women’s sports programs?
Fischer
I doubt very well. I doubt they liked it because, really, there’s a boys’
club, and there’s a way of doing in men’s athletics. Women were feeling
very good and independent over here with the AIAW, and they felt like
they got swallowed up by the old boys’ club. So, there was a little bit of
angst, anyway, when the NCAA took us over in 1982. It was transitional
for a couple of years, and there was some angst.
Gill
Did the women’s sports have a choice in moving to the NCAA?
Fischer
No.
Gill
It was kind of a shotgun wedding in their choice in going into the NCAA.
Who was pushing that? Was it here locally, or was that national?
Fischer
That was national. That was national. And the AIAW did sue the NCAA
because the NCAA started setting up rules and that they were forcing
athletic directors into deciding, “Do we keep our women under AIAW,
or do we take the carrot that the NCAA is giving us and put our
women’s sports in the NCAA?” So, they were offering some incentives
for the athletic directors to bring their women’s sports out of one
association into the other. The AIAW was suing the NCAA for
infringement or for that luring away. The women’s sports didn’t want to
be lured away, but the athletic directors were forcing us from this
association to that association.
Gill
Did all of the teams make the transition at the same time?
Fischer
Yes.
Gill
So, it was collectively across the board and nationally?
Fischer
Yes.
Gill
In 1982?
Fischer
Well, it wasn’t across the board nationally. The transition happened, but
the NCAA said, “You have to make a decision. You’re coming with us,
and it starts in 1982, okay? Or you’re not, and you stay with AIAW.”
Well, there were so few left that decided to stay with AIAW that the
association collapsed. It could no longer fund itself. This administration
at Oklahoma State decided we were going to NCAA, so we had a
transition year which was1982 in championships and everything else.

27

We were one of two teams, I think, only, that qualified for both national
championships.
Gill
In ’82?
Fischer
Yes.
Gill
So, you played in both tournaments?
Fischer
Yes. They were back-to-back, and we were in the national championship
against Texas A&M and the AIAW national championship.
Gill
The finals?
Fischer
Yes. In fact, [we were leading] going into the seventh inning with two
outs and lost. (Laughs) Painful. Come home, wash our uniforms and get
on the bus and go to Omaha for the very first NCAA women’s College
World Series.
Gill
So, you played in the last AIAW and then the championship game and
then the first women’s College World Series.
Fischer
Yes. In a ten-day span.
Gill
Wow. That would be kind of an exciting time.
Fischer
It was wild.
Gill
I can imagine.
Fischer
Yes, it was wild. So, interesting.
Gill
Were you active in AIAW, any of the committees?
Fischer
I was on a selection committee, one of the selection committees, to help
decipher who qualified for the championships and that kind of thing. I
was a representative for our Midwest region for that.
Gill
So, if you had a chance to know both organizations, were there some
philosophical differences in principles of the two organizations, and, if
so, could you kind of describe those?
Fischer
Well, I think that the AIAW, being driven by very strong progressive
women at that period in time and the Title IX, and feeling very bold
because of the law, etc., I think the thinking and the overall aspect of the
AIAW was much more progressive for women. When we went to the

28

NCAA, then we felt like we took a step back because we had fewer
scholarships. And, yes, higher money was given to us, better money for
travel and that kind of thing, but we lost our athletes. So, we had to tell
four athletes, “See you later, because we don’t have a scholarship for
you next year.” So, we had to make some very painful decisions in that
transition for our kids. We felt like we kind of went back a step, but it’s
come a long way. I think the NCAA has become very progressive.
Gill
Was there differences? For example, did the AIAW put a little more
emphasis on scholarship principles as opposed to just winning and
money? What were the perceived differences, philosophically, between
the two organizations?
Fischer
Well, we were trying at that time as an association, just like the NCAA
had gone so far forward with the men’s sports. The AIAW was trying to
do the exact same thing for women’s sports: TV, you know, very
progressive championships and large numbers of scholarships to give
more kids opportunity to play. So, we were trying to do very progressive
things and bringing up the rear. We’re having to do them later than the
NCAA. They’ve been in existence forever, and the men’s sports were
already pretty much out there, the big ones, and getting all of the press.
So, we were trying to come along and expose women nationally by
television and by championships and sponsorships and things like that.
Gill
So, scholarships was one impact on changing under the umbrella of the
NCAA. Was there any other immediate effects, benefits, good, bad, from
the merger that you recall?
Fischer
I think the number one worst impact was the scholarship. All of a
sudden, we felt like our hands were really tied on getting good
exceptional numbers of quality athletes on a team, so that part was very
painful from a coaching standpoint. However, we did see a budget
increase, not dramatic. I would say ten percent, maybe twenty in some
cases, for our travel.
I can remember sitting at a coaches meeting, and we were talking about
Title IX, and we had all of the head coaches. I remember football was
there, basketball, I mean, all of the male and female coaches, and we
were supposed to give somewhat of a little report on our team and how
this transition was helping us or not. I can remember giving a report on
my team, and I was trying to explain to them how we travel. We travel
by broken-down vans, you know, they just kept them running. It didn’t
matter how we got there. We got there. We came home in more than one
vehicle that we shouldn’t have ever even been in, but, you know, the
budget was the budget.

29

I can remember one segment where I was explaining to all of the
coaches, and really in a dramatic fashion because it was dramatic for us,
that when we went out on the road and traveled that we had one dollar
for breakfast to feed our team per kid, and we had a dollar fifty for lunch
and two dollars for dinner. That was our per diem that we spent on these
kids, so we often times went without breakfast so that we would have
enough to feed them for lunch and for dinner. I can remember Pat Jones,
football [coach], just looking at me going, “You’re not serious.” I said
“I’m totally serious. Here’s our budget. We cut it among these many
kids per trip. That’s what it comes out, and that is our reality.” And he
could not believe it. He looked directly at the athletic director and said,
“That’s criminal.” He said, “That’s not right.”
I think there were just so many people that were ignorant of what the
women were used to, what they were enduring, and until we actually got
some serious relief I had gone in year after year after year with budgets
and said, “We need this, this and this.” “But your travel budget is the
same as tennis.” And I said, “So, take five or eight kids and divide it into
that number for travel, and then take twenty people that we travel with,
with the players and the coaches, and divide it into the same number and
see what you get.” And it was at that point that there was a dawning of
the age that really our budget should be bigger because we had more
people. So, it’s just very simplistic things that needed to be better
thought out, I think, over the years, and they were. Things did get
gradually better.
Gill
Sandy, moving back to the discussion about the Cowgirl softball team,
(Laughter) could we kind of focus on the early years? I’m thinking ’78,
’79, ’80, ’81, ’82, you know, the first five years or so, those first
transitional, struggling kind of years. Do you remember what your
program budget, your total budget, was at that time?
Fischer
Oh jeez. I’m thinking my first budget for everything, fifteen, twenty
thousand dollars. Twenty-five, maybe? No, I think it was thirty-five with
salaries.
Gill
With salaries? That would have been for yours, and still some left.
(Laughter)
Fischer
And my housewife assistant. (Laughter)
Gill
But that was free, remember? (Laughter)
Fischer
That’s right, but yes it was very low. Of course, when I got here, I
inherited uniforms, so we already had that expense taken care of.
Gill

30

What was it? The basketball uniforms? (Laughter)
Fischer
It wasn’t, no. No, we had the astro-orange striped uniforms.
Gill
Did you wear the pants…
Fischer
Yes, we did.
Gill
…as opposed to the shorts? Was that your preference?
Fischer
No, that wasn’t my preference, and at the time, that wasn’t the girls’
preference either. Although, it is the girls’ preference today to wear
pants because they’re more aggressive sliders and that kind of thing.
Gill
That’s what I always thought about when I’d look at their shorts when
they’d slide. I’d think, “Oh my gosh.”
Fischer
Oh yes, painful, painful, but we had the knickers. Yes, it was interesting.
Gill
When you first came, not when you got into the NCAA, but how many
did you have? You had fourteen scholarships?
Fischer
Fifteen.
Gill
I mean fifteen, pardon me.
Fischer
Yes, for the AIAW.
Gill
Paid scholarships? Was the university paying for those? It was in your
budget?
Fischer
Yes, yes.
Gill
So, after you paid for your scholarships, you paid for your salary, which
is why you were down to a dollar for breakfast.
Fischer
Yes, we had great kids, but we couldn’t go anywhere, you know? We
were actually quite, quite fortunate. Actually, when I very, very first got
here we only had the funding for twelve, and by my second or third year,
they had upped the funding to fifteen. So, we were fully funded, but it
took a couple of years after I got here to get that, and yes. Actually, the
state of Oklahoma had some very good softball, and the very first thing I
did was rob OU’s number one pitching recruit, and it caused quite a stir,
you know. I didn’t rob her. I just talked to her after she had already
committed to OU. I was brand new on the block. I didn’t know anything.
Gill

31

And who was that?
Fischer
Nancy Teehee. She was a very good pitcher. So, we got her to come on
campus and talk, and she had heard that I had played in the pros and was
a pitcher, and that was all exciting to her. So, we got her all committed,
and then she hurt her knee playing basketball in high school her senior
year. She still came and was a very good pitcher for us, but that knee
injury really took it out of her. It changed her a little bit, but the OU
people, Marita Hynes, I mean—mad. (Laughs)
Gill
There’s already bad blood there, and that just really cemented it, didn’t
it? (Laughter)
Fischer
Yes, but we had very good athletes here, actually. Very good.
Gill
You had mentioned earlier, in terms of the scholarships, how did that
compare with, say, compared to baseball, maybe your counterpart, in
terms of scholarships?
Fischer
We have always had more than baseball because baseball has always
been NCAA. So, they were at around a nine-point- or a ten-pointsomething scholarships when we were at eleven. When we came in at
the eleven-scholarship mark, we still had more than baseball which was
interesting because they couldn’t cut us below eleven because they had
already taken us down from fifteen to eleven, and we couldn’t go below
baseball. I mean, it was like two blows if we went below baseball, so
they always kept us just a couple of tenths above.
Gill
Was softball an equivalency sport? You could partial it out so you could
have more than eleven people getting aid, but you could only total
eleven full scholarships for tuition.
Fischer
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, yes. And for a while we can only have so
many in-state, so many out-of-state, and then you pool that money and
you could split it accordingly. So, you’ve got the money of x number instate, x number out-of-state, we eventually transitioned over to the
money of all out-of-state. So, we had a bigger pool of money to work
with for athletes.
Gill
So, we were talking about facilities earlier, and I want to go back and
revisit. (Laughter) Your first year, you didn’t play any home games, ’78,
’79. No home games…
Fischer
No.
Gill
…because you didn’t have a place, or you were too embarrassed?

32

Fischer
Right, and our recreational facility was really poor. It really wasn’t well
kept, and our maintenance people really weren’t allowed to take care of
it. It was a slow-pitch dimension, and it was just a hardship for us to
entertain games at home, so we went on the road.
Gill
How did you do practice then?
Fischer
Well, we practiced at the facility over on Airport Road, those fields out
there. Yes, we got to practice out there.
Gill
Across from the golf course?
Fischer
Yes.
Gill
That had to be tough to overcome.
Fischer
Yes, it was interesting, but when we did get our own field, we thought
we had died and gone to heaven because we could go right there on
campus every day to our own field.
Gill
Well, let’s talk about that. That had to be a huge benefit for your
program. That was done in a couple of phases. Can you kind of share
how the softball stadium project had evolved?
Fischer
Right. Our softball field, like I said, started off very bare bones. We had
the skinned field, and we had no permanent fence in the outfield because
they still wanted to play some field hockey on our field. So, we had a
temporary fence. We had a backstop. We had temporary bleachers. That
was it. They would bring in a port-a-potty for the season, but other than
that, we didn’t have any facilities. We kept adding things like a press
box and a concession stand, and we finally got a permanent bathroom
added.
Then they decided at one point that it was time to actually have a
stadium because all over the country, schools had softball fields, and
then Fresno State and the University of Arizona both built stadiums. The
verbiage had never been used in our sport. Always in baseball, baseball
stadiums, and now we’re saying softball stadiums, and it was foreign
language because we never, ever had anything that was a stadium.
Then the Amateur Softball Association located in Oklahoma City built a
stadium where the College World Series is played now on a yearly basis.
Once these were starting to crop up, it then became the big deal because
of Title IX, etc., to start building softball stadiums around the country to
equate to the baseball stadiums, the equity of baseball-softball.

33

Gill
Facilities war, here.
Fischer
The facilities war, Title IX for sure.
Gill
So, how did you get the funding for your stadium?
Fischer
Well, that was up to the athletic director. I didn’t have to fundraise it,
etc. That was his job, and I know to facilitate some of it, he actually had
a football game played up in Kansas City between us and Nebraska, and
I know the funds from that game helped finish our project. You’d look at
it, the money goes up to what it costs to build it. Started out at a $1.1
million project, ended up a $2.1 million project which today isn’t much,
but he had to find that extra money. He was progressive enough to use
some funds from the football game.
Gill
In those first few years, can you talk about how your schedule changed?
You were talking about how when you first came you were playing just
—did you play in the fall at all at that time?
Fischer
Well, we were allowed to play in the fall. We were allowed to play x
number of games and you could have a certain number in the fall that
actually counted toward your win-loss getting into the World Series
under the AIAW, okay? So, we did play about a twelve-game, fifteengame fall and then played the rest in the spring.
Gill
Your first spring season, how many games did you play. Do you recall?
Fischer
Twenty, twenty-five, maybe.
Gill
What do they play, forty or fifty now?
Fischer
Oh, yes. Fifty-some.
Gill
And so when you started expanding your schedule, then, say, your
second or third year, did you increase the number you were playing?
Fischer
Yes. We increased the number of tournaments we played in because
there was a formula where one day of the tournament, no matter how
many games you played, only counted as one game. So, there were some
formulas in place that would allow you to play more games than you
were actually really allowed. So, we went on a tournament tear. We
started hosting tournaments.
We would drive to New Mexico to Texas to Illinois. I mean, we drove
anywhere we physically could get in a day and go to tournaments and

34

play as many games as we could and then drive home. And, wow. We
traveled forever, and the coaches drove the vans and the kids slept. It
was dangerous, but we did that because we wanted to compete and get
better and get national exposure, and it helped us in recruiting when
people would see us play.
Then all of a sudden, jeez, I don’t know, six, seven, eight years into my
coaching, we finally decided we needed to do a trip by air. We needed to
fly, and our first trip we flew in to Las Cruces, New Mexico, and it was
snowing. (Laughter) So, I’m thinking as we’re landing, “All this money,
we finally get to fly, and it’s freaking snowing.” But it stopped and we
played.
Gill
At least you had the long pants, anyway.
Fischer
Yes, we had the long pants. That’s right.
Gill
We were talking about when you traveled, lodging, you were explaining
four or five to a room in the early days. Did that start getting a little bit
better for you? What kind of places were you staying?
Fischer
It did start to get better. We still had four to a room, but we were staying
in better motels. You know, the roach motels were behind us now,
(Laughter) and we were moving up a little bit. We left more than one
motel in my lifetime because of insects. (Laughter)
Gill
Are you serious? It was so bad, you got up and left? (Laughter)
Fischer
(Laughs) Yes. Oh, Lord, somewhere between here and Iowa.
Gill
You’re trying to forget it, right?
Fischer
Trying to forget it, yes. But then we went three to a room, and then we
eventually got to a point where it was mandated by the administration
that we go two a room. There had been enough lawsuit things going on
around the country that we got to the point where we didn’t drive vans
anymore. We went by bus because of safety and two to a room for
equity.
Gill
Wow.
Fischer
Yes, it was like, “Whew.”
Gill
The clouds had to roll away, and the sun came out. (Laughter)
Fischer
(Laughs) We were like, “Wow, this is how they’ve been doing it forever.

35

This is cool.”
Gill
Well, along the same lines, how extensive were women’s sports
covered? Again, in those early years, right at that transition, late ’70s,
early ’80s—and was OSU’s, for example, media coverage in Stillwater,
Oklahoma City, Tulsa? What kind of coverage did softball get?
(Laughter) You’re laughing. I think I got the answer.
Fischer
I think I was not well liked in the Sports Information department because
of my insistence that we get some reporting. It became a sore point
because what was happening was, it would go into the newspaper that
people would read at five o’clock that day that we played at two o’clock.
(Laughter) We were expected to have crowds. We were expected to try
to get people to come to our games. My contention was there was never
anything in the paper saying that, “We’re going to play tomorrow night.
Please come out and watch us play,” or a schedule of any sort, public,
other than the little schedule cards that had been handed out in the
community. So, we had some go-arounds about that. It was too little too
late. Let’s make it worthwhile. Give us some coverage and then at the
end of the article say when we play again.
Gill
Hopefully a day in advance.
Fischer
Hopefully a day in advance. I went to the Stillwater NewsPress and I
asked them to actually print, which they’re doing now which is
awesome, but years ago, just print a schedule of what’s coming up this
weekend, you know, softball, two o’clock, baseball, two o’clock, so that
people have the opportunity. They do that now, and it’s quite helpful. I
know, I read it all the time. I just think we needed more.
Gill
Well, after your conversations, did they assign someone on the Sports
Information director’s staff to cover?
Fischer
We always had a student. A student was assigned to us to cover, and a
lot of them did a good job. Sometimes they traveled with us, and they
did as much as they were allowed to do. I had no issue with the students.
They took some interviews and things. The coaches, we were supposed
to report back to Sports Information after the games to let them know
who won, who lost, have a comment, that kind of thing, and then if there
was room in the paper, they would get us in.
Gill
Did you ever have to do any sort of writing of any of the material
yourself?
Fischer
Oh no. Never did that. Never did that. They wouldn’t let us do that. We
all got along in the end, but I was a little bit of a bull in a china shop

36

early on. (Laughs)
Gill
That leads me into my next part. Do you feel that when you started
earlier that you had adequate resources to be successful?
Fischer
Oh boy.
Gill
Define “adequate resources,” right?
Fischer
Yes, define “adequate resources.” I think at that moment I didn’t really
know what other schools had. I didn’t really know what we didn’t have,
and so I was focused on coaching our kids and trying to be winners
whether we played twenty games or we played fifty games. So, I was
really focused on that.
Then as I grew as a coach and started learning what other people had and
started talking to other coaches around the country, etc., I realized that
our department, and this is what I liked about Oklahoma State, we were
very successful as a department on very little money. We weren’t OU
with a blank check. We didn’t have great football teams funding us. We
always had some pretty good basketball.
I think for a long time, the overall sports program did really well on
really not very much money. To say that we could do that on a national
level, I mean, I’m very proud of that. And particularly with our sport, we
did a lot on very little. What happened then was that that became the
philosophy, and that, “You’ve done so well on so little, why should we
give you lots more?” So, it almost came back to bite you a little bit, and
we had to get through that. Does that make sense?
Gill
Sure. And I think in later years we had to start thinking bigger. I think
some in the athletic department started realizing that if we’re going to
be in the big time, be in the Big Twelve, we’re going to have to have
greater facilities. We’re going to have to increase our budgets.
Fischer
Right. When you have a huge shift in finances, you can have a huge shift
in attitude, and so the early years, the kids were extremely passionate.
And not so much the early years, I’d say most of the years I’ve coached,
our kids were extremely passionate about winning. They wanted a little
better motel and they wanted to travel better. You know, they wanted
some better things, but if you give them too much, the passion wanes
and it becomes about how much stuff they can get, how many practice
uniforms, and how many pairs of shoes they get to keep.
It was always about now we were thinking more in terms of more stuff
instead of just the internal passion of the game and that was a piece that I

37

was saddened by. I was saddened to see that. And I think it’s true today.
I think a lot of kids do base their decisions on the coolest stadium, you
know, and their travel schedule. “Do we go to Hawaii?” and, “Do we do
a lot of things that I think will be cool outside of just playing the sport
because I love it?"
Gill
Between the lines.
Fischer
Between the lines.
Gill
How did you feel about the administrative support within the athletic
department? Were there some times when the resources weren’t there?
Did you feel like they cared about your program?
Fischer
That depends on which part of my coaching career we were in. One of
the hardest moments for me was—and I forget what year it was. I think
it was early ’90s, maybe. Not really sure, but first day of the school year,
put my key in the door of our locker room, open it up, looked in it and
went, “What’s that?” Shut the door, looked at the number to make sure it
was there. Put my key back in the door, and we didn’t have a locker
room anymore.
They had broken down the wall and converted our locker room to
enlarge women’s basketball. So, what I was looking at was women’s
basketball’s locker room with the big TV and the couches and, you
know, the little wooden beautiful lockers and things, and softball no
longer had a locker room. I can’t tell you the smoke that came out of my
ears at that moment. I was so angry, I could spit. I had never been told. I
had never been asked. I did get one question at the end of the earlier
school year: “Do you use your locker room very much?” I said, “Well,
on rainy days for meetings, but mostly we meet at the field.” That was it,
and they took that wall out and took our locker room. And I was livid.
So, we had some issues that we had to fix, and that’s really one of the
things that got us really interested in creating a list of Title IX things that
we were demanding. We weren’t asking anymore. We were starting to
demand because at that point I felt we took a huge step backwards. So,
we spent a couple of years getting it right. After that, I think we did have
administrative support because they really understood how important it
was to us to have our own space (Laughs) and our own entity. So, some
things did happen that shouldn’t have, but they got corrected. So, we’re
good. We were good.
Gill
Speaking of resources, Sandy, were you encouraged to participate in
fundraising?
Fischer

38

Yes.
Gill
I know you and I did some of that back in the day.
Fischer
You bet.
Gill
But some areas, some sports, some schools didn’t really want the
women’s sports programs to be out there fundraising. Were you
encouraged in supporting your fundraising?
Fischer
Yes. We were expected to raise about 10 percent of our budget, so we
were out doing a variety of things. We would play a 100-inning game
against OU, and the kids would have to go out and get pledges. We sold
programs at basketball games and football games and helped with
cleanups in the stadium. I mean, we did some things that a lot of the
other teams did, some grunt work, actually, to fundraise. All that money
went back into our budget or into our foundation that we could spend on
things we really needed.
Gill
I’m trying to imagine you looking at that softball field when you first got
out there. When you came here and you looked at the facilities and you
looked at the condition of the program, what were your early priorities
for building the program? What did you feel had to be done to get to be
a nationally competitive program?
Fischer
We had to have really good athletes. We had to have a field to practice
on that we could call our own, that we could access anytime, day or
night. Those were the two priorities, so the very first thing I did was I
had a promise when I was hired that we would have a field within a year.
I accepted that promise and we did have a field within a year. So, that
was good. I didn’t know which kids were on scholarships, so my first
day I held open tryouts. I had advertised them, you know, little ads in the
paper and stuff, you know, “We’re having open tryouts on campus.” I
didn’t know who was on scholarship, and I kept what I deemed the best
sixteen, seventeen kids out of ninety. We had ninety kids show up.
Gill

Ninety?

Fischer

So, it took us two weeks to just whittle it down.

Gill

Did that surprise you that ninety showed up?

Fischer

In the early days like that, no. You could have a tryout today and have
two show up. I mean, it dwindled over the years. We held tryouts,
actually, every year to get a good walk-on or two, and the numbers that
showed up dwindled dramatically as the years went by. So, I ended up

39

cutting one of my players that was on scholarship, and I didn’t even
know she was. Then I had an injury and brought her back. It was really
an interesting process, and the kids that we had were excellent, excellent
athletes. So, whoever was here before—I forget who was here right
before me. I know her name. I just can’t remember it. She had brought in
some very good athletes from Tulsa and Oklahoma City on scholarship,
and so I was lucky enough to start off with a pretty good talent pool.
Gill

What were some of your early goals for your program, some milestones
you had?

Fischer

We wanted to win our conference championship and we wanted to do
that really quick. We wanted to let University of Oklahoma know and
University of Kansas know (these were all established strong programs)
that “Here, we’re coming. I don’t know how fast we’re going to get
there, but we’re coming.” So, we really cleaned up the program as far as
attitude and hustle and basic knowledge of the game, etc., and really
found passion in these kids. And I have to say, they bought in because
we finished, oh, it was second in the Big Eight tournament the first year
and won it the second year. I mean, we were on a path.

Gill

You were coming fast.

Fischer

Well, I think it came from the pro league because losing wasn’t an
option in the pro league. That was instilled in me by the legend Joan
Joyce who was, she was my mentor. And it wasn’t emotional. Losing is
just really not an option, so this is what we’re going to have to do. We
don’t have to practice long, but we have to practice smart. I think part of
that was really a good thing in that we didn’t have five-hour practices
and get bored and do that. We did what we had to do and went home.
Don’t get me wrong. These kids like to party, and they like to do their
thing, but when they got between the lines, it was really important to
them.

Gill

Speaking of some of those players, who were some of the key players
that you recruited in those early years that you built your program
around? Could you share some names and some experiences?

Fischer

Well, the kids that I inherited were some of the best athletes ever. Dr.
Jan Drummond was right here from Stillwater. She was our center
fielder and our very first All-American. She was a slow pitch player and
made the conversion very quickly. We had Pam Harper. She was AllAmerican several times, from Tulsa. We had Tina Schell. She was a
freshman pitcher when I got here, from Tulsa. Very good pitcher. We
had Nancy Teehee that I stole from OU. You know, we had Jan Krug, an
awesome shortstop. Diane Van Fossen, an awesome second baseman.

40

Gill

So, the cupboard wasn’t bare when you got here?

Fischer

No, and these were kids that had played against each other in high
school and summer ball and things like that, so for them to gel very
quickly was pretty natural because they were mostly all Oklahoma kids.

Gill

So, who were some of your first recruits? You were talking about
Teehee, your pitcher, but others like that?

Fischer

Sure. Gosh we had so many All-Americans. We had, you know, Michele
Smith, who was on the Olympic team and we had Jamie Foutch who
ended up being a three-time All-American, out of Edmond.

Gill

Was this in the early years?

Fischer

Well, those were kind of the middle years. They all kind of blend
together for me, to be really honest with you. (Laughs)

Gill

I was trying to remember. What years did Smith pitch?

Fischer

She was late ’80s. She’s going into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame
this fall.

Gill

That’s what I heard. She does commentary for the College World
Series?

Fischer

Yes, ESPN and she played in Japan for eighteen, nineteen years as a
professional and made well over six figures a year. I mean, she was quite
successful in Japan.

Gill

They loved that tall, blonde-headed gal in Japan, didn’t they?

Fischer

Oh boy, yes. But we’ve had several Olympians go through our program,
all of them pitchers. Football has the running backs, and we have the
pitchers.

Gill

Sandy, you had an extraordinary twenty-three year coaching career at
OSU and we cited some of those clips as I was opening the interview.
Let’s look at your total career and reflect back on that if we can, okay?

Fischer

Sure, sure. What would you like to know?

Gill

Over the twenty-three years, what changed in terms of training
techniques? What was different from the time you came in to when you
left?

41

Fischer

In the beginning, the coaching staff was pretty much in charge of
everything with the exception of we always had an athletic trainer for
emergencies, a student usually. But we were in charge of creating a
weight lifting program and, of course, practices and academics and
trying to get kids with tutors and different things. So, early on we were
expected to do almost all of it.
As the years went by and the money came and things became more
specialized, obviously, then all of those entities kind of spread out. We
sent the kids to the guy that set up the weight program. They went to the
training room separately. They went to the academic services unit
separately. So, really, the coaches became very focused on just training
them in the softball skills. We would often times have the track coach
come and teach them proper techniques of running and explosion and
those kinds of things. And during this very same transition, the kids are
now getting private hitting instructors, private pitching instructors, and
all of that happening in the summertime and as they’re growing up in
high school, so there’s much more instruction.

Gill

Was this the impact of Title IX? They were coming out of better high
school programs because of that impact of Title IX in public schools?

Fischer

Title IX may have impacted that, but I think it was more the parents
realizing scholarship availability. I think parents were training their kids
to get in line for a scholarship was the biggest impetus.

Gill

Kind of in their summer programs after they saw there are some talents
there, they looked to refine those.

Fischer

Sure, yes. So, the whole system kind of changed. The high school
athletics kind of went out the window a little bit. It was more the travel
ball teams because those teams would go to tournaments, and that’s
where the coaches would go to recruit, where there were a hundred
teams instead of going to individual high school games. The parents
were paying thousands of dollars to put these kids on summer teams to
get them to the tournaments to get exposed.
That was another significant difference between AIAW and NCAA.
Under AIAW we could hold tryouts on campus and we could invite kids
from all over the country. They could pay their own way in here to try
out for a scholarship. Under NCAA, no tryouts were allowed on campus.
They couldn’t physically compete for us, so we had to go see them much
more.

Gill

Was that a big shift in your career, recruiting and how you recruited?

42

Fischer

Yes, very much so.

Gill

Could you talk about that a little bit? What it was like when you started,
to then in your later years, and what was the typical, I was going to say
off-season, but there never really was an off-season.

Fischer

No there wasn’t. (Laughter)

Gill

Recruiting season. How did that change and evolve?

Fischer

Well, it changed quite a bit when we could no longer hold the tryouts.
We could no longer say, “Well, you didn’t come and try out for us, so
we had to go watch.” So, we now had to have a recruiting budget
because we were physically going to be flying to California, going to
Colorado, Texas, wherever the big tournaments…

Gill

Summer league tournaments.

Fischer

Yes. Travel ball tournaments. And the travel ball is where kids were
very specific to playing a position. In high school, they might have been
a great shortstop, but they needed her to catch or they needed her—you
know high school had needs. A lot of coaches stopped going to high
school games to recruit. They all went out in the summer time. Then
there started to be the big winter tournaments in Florida and California.

Gill

National tournaments?

Fischer

Yes. They were now having recruiting tournaments year-round. So, we
were starting to go out year-round where it used to be a month or two in
the summer you’d go out, see some tournaments, and you’d fly them in,
give them a scholarship, and the parents were like, “Thank you, that’s so
exciting.” Well, (Laughter) that changed. Recruiting became a much
bigger burden than the actual coaching of the team.

Gill

Sandy, how did your training, practice techniques change over the
years?

Fischer

You had to keep up because, like any sport, techniques changed. What
we had was an influx of techniques from baseball, particularly in hitting.
It used to be that our techniques in hitting in softball because it was so
much faster. It was a shorter, quicker game. It wasn’t a power game.
Now it is a power game because we’ve integrated our hitting techniques
with baseball. We have more of a power mentality now as opposed to
manufacturing a run with bunting and all of that.

43

Gill

Short strokes?

Fischer

Short strokes, right. Now we’ve figured out because we were getting
bigger, stronger, physically, then the mechanics, all the new technology
in bats and balls, all of them livelier. We now were gaining tremendous
distance with our swings, so our game changed to a power game. For
pitchers it became very, very specific how you teach pitching techniques
to get maximum velocity and spin, movement and things.

Gill

Did your practices become longer or shorter or more specialized?

Fischer

Well, a little bit more specialized. A little bit longer, but we did most of
our drill work indoors in the winter time. We did a lot of strategic-type
of play and a lot of inter-squad scrimmaging and creating a lot of game
type situations. We did more and more of that to get them into the
mental frame of competing under pressure. We would create pressure
situations.

Gill

How did your philosophy of the game change? How did your philosophy
of coaching, teaching, training, how did it evolve and change? Think
about from when you started when you had a couple years of experience
just as a pitching coach at Michigan State when you started off as a
green coach, how did your philosophy change from that time to the end
of your career?

Fischer

Well, I think what happened was we started to get responsibilities split
up on the coaching staff. We were allowed to have two full-time
assistants, and a graduate assistant, so now we were dispersing. You
know, you’re in charge of hitting, and you’re in charge of the infield,
and you’re in charge of the outfield, so we each had more specificity.
We each took our thing and got very specific with how we would teach
it.
Then as a coach, you have to continue to be open to change and learning
and going to clinics, and at the national convention really listening to
other coaches, how they did things, pick each other’s brain and
incorporate things. Softball coaches are very open about sharing ideas
and things that work for them. You’re always trying to get something
new in practice or it’s just, you know, after a while it’s just like, “ I am
so bored. (Laughter) We have done this a thousand times.” So, I think it
was just a matter of consistently integrating new things and ideas to keep
it fresh.

Gill

Well, how has, in your opinion, intercollegiate softball changed since
you first started coaching?

44

Fischer

The game is bigger, stronger, faster. The kids, they’re better athletes.
Some of them are better athletes, but I also think that our older athletes
from years ago had much more passion. Their goal really wasn’t the
scholarship. Their goal was to be a winning unit. They really, really had
a lot of pride in being winners and being together and having each
other’s back. I think that still exists, but I don’t think it’s as intense or as
big a focal point.
I think getting the scholarship is such a focal point growing up for these
kids now that even sometimes they’re burned out when they get here. I
think a little bit of that wanes, but the coaches, the older coaches, still
have the ability to instill that passion and that love for the game to keep
them focused. It keeps you focused instead of on all the stuff.
I think the parents are closer to the kids now. I think the kids with cell
phones and text messaging, and I think there’s a whole different line of
communication between parent and child now that’s very, very different.
Kids went off to college years ago, and they were independent. They
might call home once a week or check in or maybe go home once a
month, maybe, if they’re close by. And now, it’s daily, multiple daily,
communications with parents and things, and how it went at practice or
how it went during the game or, you know, “I didn’t get to play.”
I do think technology has changed some of how the kids are, and it’s not
their fault. The parents get a little nervous about letting the kids out of
their sight. You know, it’s a dangerous world, so it’s just different. I
think they’re less independent as much as they say they want to be more
independent. In some ways, they’re less.

Gill

Sandy, can you share some of the accomplishments of your teams over
the years, some milestones of the Cowgirl softball program?

Fischer

Wow.

Gill

I know there have been a lot of highlights.

Fischer

Been a lot of highlights. I would say the one thing I wish we’d have
done that we didn’t accomplish, or haven’t accomplished yet, is win a
Big Twelve championship. We won so many of the Big Eight
championships and so many in a row that when we merged with the
Texas schools and went to the Big Twelve, we were not successful. We
were successful getting to the championship, but we didn’t win it. That’s
one thing, I think, that’s a goal that has been missed so far.

Gill

How many times did you get to the championship game in the Big
Twelve play?

45

Fischer

Just my last year, just my last year coaching. I know. So close, yet so far.
OU won, but we won lots of championships, and we had incredibly
successful kids. When Michele Smith was here we were ranked number
one in the nation all season long and should have been in the national
championship and missed it by a pitch, you know, that kind of thing.
And we could have won it that year, without any question we were the
best team.

Gill

I’ve got to ask. Where did you find Michele? Is there a story behind how
you recruited her?

Fischer

There is a story behind that, and that involves Margaret Rebenar.
Margaret being my assistant coach, we got a phone call in the office one
day from a softball camp out in the Poconos of Pennsylvania looking for
an instructor because somebody got sick at the last minute, and they had
heard that we had done some other camps. I said I couldn’t go, so I
asked Margaret if she wanted to go. It was extra money. Remember,
now, we were doing the fireworks stand. (Laughter)

Gill

I had forgotten that.

Fischer

She said, “Sure.” So, she went and was an instructor at a camp in the
Poconos, and Michele was there. Michele was such a late bloomer. She
didn’t even start pitching until the summer after her sophomore year in
high school and only pitched because they didn’t have one in her high
school, and she loved her coach. Michele was a first baseman. So, she
went to that camp specifically to learn pitching, and Margaret was a
pitcher, so she was teaching pitching. That’s how that union happened.
So, Margaret actually discovered her and came home and said, “Oh…”
(Laughs)

Gill

Got a diamond in the rough.

Fischer

“…we’ve got a diamond in the rough and we need to get an out-of-state
scholarship. We need to insist on it.” So, we recruited against
Cal[ifornia] Berkeley, Cal State Fullerton and some other schools to get
her. It was a tough get because once people saw her, they saw her
potential. She was extremely raw. She didn’t really have a lot of pitches.
She was just learning, and she was great. Michele learned a lot at
Oklahoma State. Trust me, she learned a lot, but she got so much better
after she left because she took what she learned and just developed it.
She couldn’t have learned everything in the four years she was here. She
started so late. So, she got her fundamentals here and then just excelled
and kept working on them.

46

Gill

And you mentioned she played, fourteen, fifteen, eighteen seasons in the
Japanese league. Are there any professional women’s softball leagues in
the US?

Fischer

Yes. There are two entities at the moment. One is called the NPF which
is the National Pro Fastpitch League and they have, I believe, six teams
around the country. They play each other, and it’s a regular professional
league based on the league I played in back in the ’70s. They’re trying
the same thing, so they’ve been at that now for several years. They’re
just now starting to get some growth because it’s been individual owners
versus corporate owners, which they have in Japan.
Then there’s an entity called the PFX, the Pro Fastpitch X-treme Tour,
and I coached on that tour for the last several years. Two teams go out
into youth tournaments and put on clinics, and we do sessions about
recruiting, and we do coaches clinics. Then our two teams play each
other, and they’re made up of Olympians, All-Americans, names that
kids would know in the softball world.

Gill

Signing autographs.

Fischer

Signing autographs until we’re blue. You know a lot of hands-on
hugging and watching kids play and clapping for them, a lot of
interaction. It’s just kind of a neat deal for the kids to really rub elbows,
and particularly when we were in the Olympics. These Olympians were
very highly regarded and well received, and it was a fun tour. Now that
the Olympians are no more, per se...

Gill

Is that a disappointment for you, to say the least?

Fischer

Oh, it’s a horrible disappointment. It’s an injustice because our sport was
just booming all over the world, and boom. That fast, it’s over.

Gill

Working to get it back, I hope?

Fischer

Well, they’re working, but so far, no luck.

Gill

Switching just a little bit on your players, over the years were you
satisfied with the academic performance of your players?

Fischer

For the most part. You always have a couple that, you know, when you
have a team the size of a softball team, there’s always a couple. We
graduated, oh, between 90, 95 percent of our kids.

Gill

Really, that high?

47

Fischer

We were that high.

Gill

Wow.

Fischer

Yes, and it was important because the number one reason they should be
here is that we matched up in their academic interests.

Gill

That’s great. I didn’t realize it was that high.

Fischer

Yes, we were extremely high, and it goes hand in hand with success.
Academic achievement is a whole other challenge, so it goes hand in
hand.

Gill

Looking back over your coaching career at OSU, anything you’d change
if you had a chance to do it differently? It’s hypothetical, but just
looking back.

Fischer

That’s a good question because you coach as you go, and you do the best
you can at that moment in time.

Gill

You’re a different coach ten years down the road than you were before.

Fischer

Yes, you are. I had the same assistant coach forever and ever and ever
and ever, and that was probably, for most of the time, that probably
added a great deal of stability. Then again on the other hand, I’m not
sure if we didn’t stagnate a little bit because we were almost too familiar
all the way through. So, maybe had some different sprinklings of
different folks on the coaching staff might have been a good thing.
As far as the players and everything else, yes, I think we could have hit a
little more or we probably could have done a few better things at
practice. We may have stagnated there upon occasion, too, and over time
you can only do so much, but not so much. I think we were successful
enough, and we had good chemistry on the coaching staff for a very,
very long time, and we had really good players. We had three Olympians
come through and lots of All-Americans, and when you have good
talent, you can go a long way.

Gill

Good things happen, don’t they?

Fischer

Good things happen, yes.

Gill

Good players do make coaches better coaches. (Laughs)

Fischer

Maybe been a little closer to the parents. The parents, they were always
an entity that were in the background and maybe should have pulled

48

them in a little bit more. It’s hard to say.
Gill

Sandy, some special memories that you have during your OSU career,
can you share some of those with us?

Fischer

Wow. I think being named National Coach of the Year was an
overwhelming moment because it really wasn’t just me. It was the
coaching staff, it was always the players, and it was a magical year that
we had.

Gill

The year you were ranked number one?

Fischer

Yes, yes, and, so, to get that honor out of all the coaches around the
country was quite overwhelming. Being inducted into the Hall of Fame
in 2008, after the whole thing was over for a long time, was really
touching. It was really, professionally, very touching to be honored by
your peers like that, so that was cool.

Gill

Sandy, again, your last year, then, that you coached, the last season was
2002?

Fischer

Two thousand one.

Gill

Two thousand one.

Fischer

Yes, and it was an interesting year. It was one of those years where we
had some injuries and some different things. We knew we were on the
bubble NCAA-wise, and we really thought we had done enough by
getting into the Big Twelve championship that year to get us over the
hump. When we weren’t selected to go to the NCAAs, it just made the
year really disappointing. It was sad, but we had had other years where
we didn’t make it, but we made it most of the time.
The years we didn’t make it were really devastating because we were
used to winning and going and continuing on and that kind of thing.
After you do something over twenty years in your life, I think you get to
a point where you get almost saturated with it and it tends to wane a
little bit. I think if you look at anybody’s coaching career, you know, it’ll
have hills and valleys and that kind of thing. I think today athletic
directors are allowing fewer valleys. I think they’re under such pressure
to win that coaches now live under a much different pressure than I
probably ever did.

Gill

It must have taken a tremendous amount of energy and untold sacrifices,
Sandy, on your part to build up a nationally competitive and recognized
program from scratch, truly from scratch, and keep it there for so long.

49

What kept you going for those twenty-three, twenty-four years? What
was your source of strength? What kept you going?
Fischer

You know, I think years ago that my mother instilled in me possibilities
that everything is possible, and I tried to give that to my players, that no
matter what, no matter who you are or whatever, you’re blessed to be
here and be a part of this team. And we’re blessed to be here together at
this moment in time, and if we pool our talents and our energies and our
efforts, how far we go is endless. It can take us all the way.
I think the kids, the majority of the time, really enjoyed testing their
endless possibilities as a team and as individuals. We weren’t always
loving each other but when they got between the lines and played
together, they still performed really, really well because they loved the
sport and they loved playing for Oklahoma State.

Gill

So, a lot of your passion’s derived from seeing the development of the
young ladies that you worked with?

Fischer

Yes. I think my ability to inspire them was better than my ability to
teach them how to hit, if that makes any sense. And I think sometimes
you just have to tap a person’s possibilities, and then they will bloom.
They become easier learners when they want to learn, and they’re
willing to go further for you if there’s a willingness to go forward. I
think, probably toward the end, that willingness changed. I don’t know. I
think was burned out. I think at some point you just do the same thing,
and I had loss. I had a great tragedy in my family. I had lost four family
members, my entire family to cancer.

Gill

Your parents and your brother and sister?

Fischer

Yes. I lost my father, mother, brother and sister the decade before I
ended my coaching career, or it was ended. So, each time one of those
tragedies happened, it took a little bit out of me. And by the time we got
to the last one which was my sister, and I was her primary caregiver
during the active spring season, then, you know, by that time I think my
energies were drained. My emotional energies, my ability to inspire, you
know, my love of life and all that, it just changed a little bit.

Gill

And, as I recall, to take care of your sister, you had to step away for
about three months, too, from the program, didn’t you?

Fischer

Yes, yes, so the assistant coaches had to take over for three months
while I was gone right in the middle of the active part of going to
tournaments and our season. So, it was very hard on them, it was very
hard on our players, and it was very, very hard on me to be away

50

because I was totally torn. I mean, I really needed to be with my sister.
Gill

Then again, coming back had to be tough for you, but for Margaret and
your other staff members.

Fischer

Very tough.

Gill

She’s finally, after all these years, got a chance to lead, and then she’s
got to step back again.

Fischer

Sure.

Gill

It must’ve been tough.

Fischer

It was a very tough shift. That all happened over several years. That was
like ’98, ’99, and so for those several years between there and 2001, it
was just a real tough thing for us all to try to shift back and all that. And
the players probably got caught in the middle of that a little bit and so it
was just one of those things that probably wasn’t good for our program.

Gill

So, the year that your sister, you had to take care of her and finally she
died, what year was that?

Fischer

Ninety-eight. That was ’98, and that was our last time that we went to
the College World Series. Yes. So, I mean, life just presents a lot of
different things, and one thing will affect another.

Gill

Well, speaking of that, Sandy, is there life after coaching?

Fischer

Oh, Lord, God, yes. (Laughter)

Gill

Can you talk about some of your activities when you retired from OSU?

Fischer

I miss OSU, and I miss my salary, (Laughs) and, of course, I miss the
kids and coaching, but I live on forty acres and I have horses. So, I’m
partially retired, and yet on the other half I’ve done some coaching in the
summers on the pro league, and I’ve worked part time for a little
company that sells some products for our sport, and I’m an inventor. I’ve
invented several training aids that are out on the market now.

Gill

Can you mention a couple of those?

Fischer

Well, one is called a Tee Stacker, and really what it does is allow you to
stack two or three balls on a standard tee, a hitting tee, and if you are
properly on-plane at contact when you hit the top ball, then it leaves, and
the Tee Stacker leaves, and the next ball is ready to hit right away.

51

However, if you’re off-plane and you’re not swinging correctly or well,
then it compresses the stacker and then the bottom ball will fall off. So,
you know right away whether you were on-plane or not. It’s about
quality of swings versus quantity because you can get really bad habits
off the tee. You can swing wrong fifty times and ingrain it in your mind,
so it’s to help kids get it right off the tee.
Gill

Practice doesn’t make perfect, but perfect practice makes perfect.

Fischer

There you go. And the most recent one out is called the Hand Tee, the
Precision Hand Tee. So, it’s a handheld tee so the coach can put that ball
at any point in the contact zone, in, out, high or low. They can move it.
On every swing it can be in a different spot, so it’s kind of a really cool
entity too.

Gill

So, you’re involved with that company that markets it and promotes the
product?

Fischer

Oh yes. I’ve got a book full of products. (Laughs)

Gill

So, you do camps, and you work with coaches.

Fischer

I haven’t done any camps of late, and I haven’t really done much
speaking of late. I have done some recruiting seminars. I’ve gone out
into some of the communities in Edmond and different places and talked
to parents about recruiting and the coach’s side of it so that they can
understand what coaches are thinking. Yes, I keep my toe in it a little bit.

Gill

So, here’s one of those really philosophical questions for you Sandy.
How do you hope people remember Sandy Fischer?

Fischer

Oh, wow.

Gill

Thinking back on it, talking about players, coaches, people that have
known you in your life in your coaching career, how do you hope people
will remember you?

Fischer

That’s a really interesting question. I hope particularly the players
remember that I always had their good at heart, that they were a part of
the group and that my job was to guide the group. Along the way I hope
I had some personal influence, and I hope I was helpful to most. I know
not to all, you know, the poor kids that got cut from the team, this, that
or the other. I mean, there will always be some folks I wish I could talk
to personally and say it was never personal. I hope they remember me as
someone who really wanted to help them move forward, not only as a
player, but mostly as a person. That’s what I hope. I don’t know.

52

Competitive, fun, strong, humorous, cantankerous sometimes, you
know, but always with the right thing in mind for the end that we were
going to progress to a point further than they ever thought they could go.
Gill

Sandy, what do you want to do with the rest of your life, (Laughter)
besides play with your horses?

Fischer

There you go. I want to be happy, and I want to be happy to know that if
I died today, I felt like I left some good behind here at Oklahoma State
and with my family and friends, and I just want to live each day with
sunshine in my heart knowing that in the end, life really is good. It’s a
journey, and it’s what we make of it. It’s what we make of it.

Gill

Let me step back, if it’s okay, and ask you a question. You struggled for
so many years, you and coaches of women’s sports. We talked about
that earlier in the interview, about equity, equality, equal pay and these
issues, a really, particularly contentious issue that you alluded to, and
that I visited in another interview with Ann Pitts Turner, a long-time golf
coach at Oklahoma State University.

Fischer

Right.

Gill

That issue of equal pay has really been a sore spot, I know, for a lot of
you.

Fischer

Yes.

Gill

I want to ask you your perspective. You know, Ann had, back in the ’92
and ’93, in that era, a lawsuit over that issue of equal pay which she
actually won. I know it was tough on her emotionally to have to take that
action against her school. She graduated from here, and the school she
loved. How important was the outcome of that litigation, and how did it
impact you and other women’s programs here, do you think, at
Oklahoma State?

Fischer

When she first decided to do it, I was shocked because I knew the
ramifications would be very, very strong, and I truly admired her and
totally supported her in it. It was very personal for her, and she took a lot
of slack for it and some of it not very good from folks in the community,
etc., and it was a hardship for her. I don’t think many people really
realize when you sue the university, how hard that is. It is hard, but she
was one of many pioneer women around the country that were doing just
that: equal pay for equal work.
In the coaching world, if you are given the same number of athletes to
coach, the same budgets and the same everything, and you come to work

53

every day just like your male counterpart, then you should be paid. It’s
pretty simple. There were great inequities that she was fighting for, and I
was a witness at her trial. I was one of her witnesses and truly believed
in what she did, and so when she won, it was a step up for all of us. You
know, the athletic director talked to us very differently then, and some
compensation came along the way, and all of a sudden we had contracts.
We had had no contracts. We were year-to-year, and if they were done
with you, they were done with you. So, now we had contracts. Some
people thought that was a real positive and some people didn’t because
then at the end of that contract you were always reviewed. There was a
decision to be made, whereas if you were on year-to-year, if you’re
winning, things keep going and nobody thinks about it. So, there were
people who thought that was a positive and that might be a negative. So,
there was good and bad, but ultimately Ann created an environment
where the athletic directors around the country, I mean, she was one of
many, had to step up and say, “You know, we haven’t been paying them
enough and it’s not right. It’s not fair.” So, she really was a pioneer, and
she took it on the chin, and it was very personal for her.
Gill

Sandy, I understand that there were two or three coaches that got some
fairly significant adjustments in salary pretty quickly after she won that
case. Is that right?

Fischer

Yes, some did. I don’t think mine was particularly fast, but it was faster.
It was on a much faster track, and mine was based on, and most of them
were based on, salaries of all the other coaches in your conference, and
then top twenty teams. They started doing some formulas to start basing
it on which was quite helpful.

Gill

Having thought about that perspective, I think I hear you saying that
that really caused them to step back and really look at the salaries based
on some facts, analyzing and doing contracts in a much more
professional approach to it than they had been before.

Fischer

Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. So, she was a pioneer for us really in this
department, and I will forever be thankful and grateful that she did that
because it was hard on her. Yes, it was a great thing.

Gill

Sandy, again, thank you. I know this has been a fairly extensive
interview. It provided us with great information. Thank you for sharing
that.

Fischer

Oh, no problem.

Gill

And congratulations on just an outstanding career. I’ll finish where I

54

started. You’re a legend in OSU softball.
Fischer

Well, thank you very much. It has been a pleasure to be a part of
Oklahoma State.

Gill

Sandy, one question I did forget to ask you. One thing that I had heard
alluded to in a couple of interviews I’ve done is that there was a
question, maybe a concern about it, as you look at women’s sports at
Oklahoma State University, there’s only one women’s coach right now
in the program. How do you feel about that?

Fischer

(Laughs) How much tape you got? Because of where I started here and
because of the opportunity I was given, I feel very, very strongly that
women coaches should be hired when at all possible to coach a women’s
sport. It’s interesting because when the salaries were so low, men were
not interested in it. As we progressed, and this was actually predicted by
the AIAW years, thirty years ago, predicted that it would come to this,
that the salaries would get so good that the men would start to infiltrate
the coaching ranks of women. I didn’t believe it at the time. I totally
believe it today, and I think there are many reasons for it. I think in our
sport in particular, and I can speak to softball, we now have athletic
directors that believe if you’ve played baseball in your history, you
would transcend and make a very good softball coach. I think athletic
directors sometimes also feel more comfortable dealing with men than
they do with women.

Gill

Because most athletic directors are men.

Fischer

Absolutely, and I think there is an alliance there. Whether they will
admit it or not, I don’t know. I also think that for women, if you lose a
job as a woman, there must have been a reason, and it’s really hard to
transcend that and move on. If you lose a job as a man, then you’re just a
better fit somewhere else. There’s a double standard in hiring and
rehiring women, so with a double whammy, women cannot transcend
and go coach in baseball, so that door is closed. This door is closing that
we have currently because more and more men are being hired. We used
to be 90 percent female coaches coaching female sports. We are now
below 40 percent. We are now between 30 and 40 percent women
coaching now.

Gill

Well, Sandy, is it because there’s not an adequate coaching pool out
there?

Fischer

A lot of women, once out, stay out because they have fought the battles
for so long that it wears them out, and so they stay out. Players are so
burned sometimes from playing their college career and having spent

55

their whole childhood getting a scholarship then playing, they drop out,
and their interest in coaching has waned. The interest in coaching for
women in the ’90s was pretty high. I had lots of players asking to be
student assistants, and, “I want to coach, too,” and, “Tell me how to do it
and where to go,” and we had lots of interest. It has waned in this past
decade because I think they also see the trend, but in some ways they’re
burned out.
It is an interesting thing that’s happening, and philosophically an athletic
director has to take a stand and protect women’s sports by at least having
a member of a coaching staff or two, or the majority of the coaches on
that staff should be women because that’s equity, and women play the
sport their whole life. They should know what they’re doing, and they
should be given the chance to have that expertise rewarded. We’re
moving in a direction where athletic directors truly believe the male
coaches are the more successful coaches, and that’s really hard for me to
watch. That’s really hard for me to watch.
Gill

What do you think it’s going to take to break that trend? And, again, I
want to ask the question because I’m not sure that I fully understood
your question, but is there an adequate pool?

Fischer

Yes.

Gill

I kind of hear you saying that the pool seems to be decreasing of, maybe,
women who want to coach?

Fischer

It’s decreasing, yes, because the opportunities are less. If we were
committed philosophically to hiring women to coach women’s sports,
then the job pool is bigger, but the job pool is shrinking for women
because more men are being hired. Not that male coaches are bad. I’m
not saying that, but I think a staff should be a blend, a good blend, and I
think that the best coach, when at all possible, should be hired. I know
athletic directors today are out there, and I know that they’re saying,
“We hired the best person. So, based on our interview group, we thought
he was the best person,” or “she was the best person,” but more often
than not, it’s a male.
What happens, too, is that they will give a male assistant coach an
opportunity to be a head coach quicker than they will give a female
assistant coach the opportunity to be a head coach. Sometimes it’s
money. Sometimes it’s cheaper to hire the assistant into a head job, and
“I think this guy is better than this gal.” There is a philosophy the
athletic directors have: “Is it important to try to maintain the equity of
men and women coaches? Is that important to me as an athletic director?
Is that important to the future of female sports?” And to really

56

understand deep down inside if it is or it isn’t to that athletic director.
The hiring practices then will show you that. That’s my opinion, but a
lot of times, you know, I think in their mind they’re not that deep into
philosophy. I think they’re trying to find the best coach they can at that
moment, or whoever is brought to them is the best coach, but I think
when push comes to shove, the female should be given the opportunity.
And if she fails, then replace her with a man.
Really, honestly, it’s really hard. I think we’ve gone backwards. I think
we’re going backwards in the hiring of women, and it’s always
interesting to see how many women are coaching at the World Series
versus the male coaches.
Gill

How has that been in recent years?

Fischer

We still have more women than men, but it’s becoming more fifty-fifty,
and so there is this little shift, you know. And I like the guys. I know a
lot of the guy coaches, and they’re good people, and I’m not saying that
they’re not, but their tendency then will be to hire one female and one
male a lot of times. So, you end up many staffs that are two male
coaches versus one female, and it really should be the other way around.
It really should be if we’re going to continue to progress and really open
the door for more women to come into the coaching pool. They feel
stifled because you don’t see many sixty-year-old- or fifty-five- or sixtyfive-year-old women who can just jet off and get another career. I mean,
there are men still coaching at the college level that are eighty years old.

Gill

Wow.

Fischer

Definitely. Football, basketball, probably. If you’re sixty-five, you’re
still young and coaching. If you’re sixty-five, you are so over if you are
a female. You’re so done, so there’s inequities underlying. Whether
they’d be admitted to, I don’t know. That’s just my personal opinion.
Oklahoma State needs to hire more women. We’re very out of balance
right now, and it doesn’t bode well for us philosophically holding up the
great attributes of Title IX. I mean, it doesn’t show parents, “I want my
daughter to go there because they really invest in what’s going on for her
future.” I don’t know. I just think we’ve got to come back to the center
here sometime. We’ll be a much more balanced department.

Gill

I appreciate it, (Laughter) and with that we’ll sign off. Thank you.

Fischer

Okay. Thank you.
