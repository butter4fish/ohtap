Billie Jones
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Janet Ahrberg

Tallahassee, Florida
Ahrberg

My name is Janet Ahrberg, and today is April 23, 2011. I’m in
Tallahassee, Florida, on the Florida State University campus,
interviewing Dr. Billie J. Jones. The interview is being conducted as
part of the O-STATE Stories, an oral history project of the OSU Library.
Billie, thank you for joining me today. I’m going to start by having you
tell me about your early life, where and when you were born, and where
did you grow up, your family, your schools you attended. I know you
came from a large family of nine siblings so there must be some
interesting stories about being raised among so many siblings. Ready to
start?

Jones

Yes. I was born in Murfreesboro, Arkansas, a small town in southwest
Arkansas, a population of probably eight hundred. There was one paved
road, and it was the highway that went through town. There were no
streetlights, no stoplights. The elementary, junior, and high school were
all on one campus and so forth. I was the youngest of nine children. The
one next to me was a boy. There were no girls in my neighborhood when
I was very young so he and his friends were my playmates for all of this
time. So the opportunity for me to be an athlete was really very limited.
The only thing we had was I played basketball in high school.
I graduated and went to a junior college, at that time, Magnolia A&M.
Interestingly enough, the reason I went there was that I had a ride
(laughter) so that I had a place that I could go with someone and have a
ride to get to that campus. Then after being there for two years, I stopped
and taught a year. This was in the late ’70s where you didn’t have to
have a degree, or really be certified, to teach. I went back to my

4

hometown and taught science and physical education and then left to go
to Arkansas State Teachers College in Conway, Arkansas, where I
completed my degree. Then I went to the University of Arkansas to be a
graduate assistant and to complete my master’s. I taught at Drury
College in Springfield, Missouri, for two years. Then I went to the
public schools in North Kansas City, Missouri, where I taught primarily
the middle school for ten years. Then I went to Oklahoma State in 1961.
Ahrberg

What were some of your favorite sports that you played growing up?
You said basketball was your first love.

Jones

Well, that was the only choice I had to be an athlete in high school.
Probably, my sport of choice was football, (laughter) but that was
because I played with my brother and his friends. We really didn’t have
an opportunity to play anything except what we made up ourselves. No
recreation program, no athletic program or anything, so it was whatever
you can—the pick-up baseball game, the football game. I picked up a
tennis racket when I was a senior in high school, because one of the
young men in town came home from his college for Christmas break. He
was a tennis player so he set up a tennis net in the gym, and that was my
first time to pick up a tennis racket and hit it over the net.

Ahrberg

What did your parents do for a living there?

Jones

Well, my mother, of course, stayed home, reared the children, made a
garden about the size of two building lots. It was a small town. We had
our own cow. They owned pigs. They owned a garden. They owned
chickens. My father was a county politician, and sometimes he was in
office, and sometimes he wasn’t in office. It was sort of an up-and-down
thing.

Ahrberg

What part of Arkansas is this?

Jones

This is in southwest. It’s about sixty miles south of Hot Springs, and it’s
noted for one thing, and that is the diamond mines. So it is a state park,
but it has the only real diamonds. So that’s its notoriety.

Ahrberg

How many of your family members attended college?

Jones

Let’s see. The first three went for a year of—I guess there were three,
and it was the oldest three, and they made it before the Depression hit.
Then the Depression hit, and that changed everything completely. So
there was a big gap, and then I went to college. Then, one of my older
sisters, after marriage and having children and so forth, went back and
completed a degree.

5

Ahrberg

Okay, now, what brought you to OSU?

Jones

Well, I was with a friend from Oklahoma. She lived in Oklahoma City,
her folks did, so I went down, and we went to Oklahoma State campus
and met Ms. Colvin. Never could call her Valerie. Met Ms. Colvin and
Ruth Lindsey. I guess those were the two that I met, and we talked. I
can’t remember who—somebody was leaving, and so Ms. Colvin was
looking for someone. I struck a chord with her, I guess, so she wanted
me to join the faculty in the fall of ’61. I think I took a small pay cut to
come down from North Kansas City Schools to Oklahoma State.

Ahrberg

So you were hired as a faculty member there.

Jones

Yes.

Ahrberg

What were you teaching? You were hired in the PE program?

Jones

In the physical education program, yes. Whatever Ms. Colvin told me to
teach, that’s what I taught. (Laughter) It never occurred to her that
whatever she said you could do, you had to do it. I have no idea.
Looking back, I can’t remember what rank I came in as, whether it was
instructor, whether it was—I know it wasn’t above assistant professor
because Ms. Colvin, bless her, she wasn’t concerned with money,
whether you got a raise or not. That was it, but nothing except that you
worked with the students, and that was her interest.

Ahrberg

Do you recall the age at the time that you started at OSU?

Jones

Let’s see. That was ’61 so I was probably about thirty-three or thirtyfour.

Ahrberg

Who was the president of the campus at the time?

Jones

I cannot recall his name.

Ahrberg

Okay, was it Oliver Willham?

Jones

Sounds familiar, yes.

Ahrberg

Okay.

Jones

In ’61, yes.

Ahrberg

Is there anything about the president, even though you don’t recall his
name, that stood out?

6

Jones

No, all I remember is physical education at that time was in the College
of Sciences, and [Robert] Kamm was the dean of Arts and Sciences. I
had no direct contact with him, but Ms. Colvin worked very well with
him, and she thought he was very good and was very good to the
physical education program. She was pleased to be in that college as
opposed to the College of Education.

Ahrberg

What courses did you teach?

Jones

Well, to begin with, it was all primarily activities. Taught archery, field
hockey, badminton, basketball, softball, flag football. Whatever it was,
that was it. (Laughs)

Ahrberg

Was it co-ed, or did you work with…

Jones

At that time it was not co-ed.

Ahrberg

So you worked with the women?

Jones

Worked with women only. One of my assignments when I came in, I
was put in charge of the women freshman physical education majors. At
that time when you came in, you could declare a major, so those who
declared physical education as their major, then I was their mentor or
advisor or whatever. That was one of my assignments in that.

Ahrberg

Where did you teach? What building were you in at that time?

Jones

Jeez. (Laughter) We were all over campus. We were in the armory, and
then there was—what was it? Oh, man, that little-bitty building in the
middle of campus that was really old.

Ahrberg

Old Central?

Jones

May have been, but it was just a small building.

Ahrberg

Gundersen?

Jones

I don’t know, but, anyway, that’s where the offices were. Ms. Colvin
had a private office, but the rest of us were all in a big open room. We
tried to divide it off so we’d have a little privacy, and she would have
none of it. It was going to be open and so forth. Taught in that. We
taught—I think archery was by North Hall. Was there a North Hall or a
North…

Ahrberg

There’s the Classroom Building, Gundersen…

7

Jones

I don’t know. It was really tough to get across campus to your next class,
but that was immaterial. (Laughs)

Ahrberg

You mentioned Valerie Colvin. What were some of the other faculty
members that you worked with?

Jones

I worked with Ruth Lindsey, Myr-Lou Rollins, who was the dance
teacher who drove everybody nuts because nobody wanted to modern
dance. She insisted that, well, they had to. Let’s see, Ruth Lindsey, those
were the primary women. Then there were some men who taught, but
I’m having a senior moment. I can’t remember their names. (Laughter)

Ahrberg

You mentioned earlier in our conversation, you did work with, was it
Ada Van Whitely?

Jones

Whitley.

Ahrberg

Whitley.

Jones

Ada Van, yes, Ada Van. She and I came at the same time.

Ahrberg

So what do you remember most about Ms. Colvin? You kind of talked
about that. What stands out about Ms. Colvin in your mind when you
think of Valerie?

Jones

She was a dedicated woman. She wanted to do well. She wanted the
students to learn. One of the things she did, at Christmas she would have
an open house for the majors, and she would have them come early and
late. One of the favorite things was rum balls. (Laughs) She would put
out only a few at the beginning because they went so fast. If she didn’t,
then there wouldn’t be anything left for the next group, but you had to
dress. You couldn’t come like that and whatever. At that time, it was
skirts and all of that so you had to dress. I guess she thought God would
take care of you because she never talked about a raise in salary, what
you’ve earned, or anything, or a promotion or moving up. It was all
about that.
She wanted to do a summer camp so she asked—she told, she didn’t ask
—Meg Lester and me that we would be the directors of the camp. Well,
we said, “Michigan State has a big one. We should go up there and see
how it’s done.” She said, “You don’t need to. You just do it.” (Laughs)
So we did. She did not like intercollegiate athletics because she thought
it was not fair to spend that much money on a few but rather spend the
money on the majority, which was, of course, not the athletes. So we did
have extramurals, and we also had intramurals. But intercollegiate, she
was from the old school, not that women couldn’t do it, but there was

8

not the money for it. It should be spent on the masses, not on the very
few skilled. Very outspoken, but loved. (Laughs)
Ahrberg

That’s good.

Jones

Loved and respected.

Ahrberg

Were you involved in the Women’s Athletic Association or later known
as the Women’s Recreation Association? It was the sponsoring
organization for women’s intramural programs.

Jones

Not really. I can’t remember who did that because most of mine was
involved in, I guess, extramurals, so that when we played other colleges
then that was…

Ahrberg

Did you know Albin P. Warner? He was the head of the Department of
Health, Physical Education, and Recreation.

Jones

Not too well. I think about the time he came I took a sabbatical and was
gone for a year. Then went back, and he was the chair at that time. Then
I left so I really didn’t have much contact with him.

Ahrberg

While you were there at OSU, what women’s sports stood out from the
others, in your opinion?

Jones

For women?

Ahrberg

Yes.

Jones

Of course, volleyball. I was the coach. (Laughs) If you read those
articles, you will see that we were the one. I coached volleyball, and then
I started the track team so those two of course, in my mind. Oklahoma
State, at that time, was the leader in women’s athletics. We were good.
We held our own so at that time we had a head start because of the
people.

Ahrberg

That’s interesting. So you were a coach of volleyball and track. Were
there any other sports you were…

Jones

Let’s see, I think I dabbled in badminton a little bit and also field hockey
for a year or two, but volleyball and track were the two primary.

Ahrberg

How were the women recruited for these sports? Did they just sign up?
It’s a lot different now with Title IX.

Jones

Oh, yes. What it was, you put a notice in the paper or on the bulletin

9

board, “Tryouts Monday, Wednesday, Friday, three o’clock in the
armory.” Those who wanted to try out came, and they tried out. After a
short tryout period, they were selected as who would be on the teams,
then that was named. It was posted on the bulletin board, and I always
went alphabetically so that they would never know who was picked last
or first or whatever. So, no, no one was recruited.
I remember there was a really, very good golfer, Mary Kay Hyde, who
came from St. Joe, Missouri. She came because she thought that maybe
the fellow who coached golf at that time—I can’t remember his name,
but he was a well-known golf coach. The Oklahoma State men’s golf
team was very good. He wouldn’t have anything to do with her, which
was very disappointing to her. She was the only one I knew that picked a
particular school because, possibly, of an athletic opportunity. Of course,
the women played everything. They’d play volleyball, then they might
play basketball or whatever.
Ahrberg

Was there a lot of administrative support for the women’s programs?

Jones

For the athletic?

Ahrberg

Yes.

Jones

No. There was no money. I guess we had state cars, and we were limited
at first. We’d have what we’d call a Sports Day, where you might go to
Central, in Edmond. I mean, Central is in Ada, isn’t it?

Ahrberg

Central University is in Edmond.

Jones

Spend the day there and play five volleyball matches. Then it got to
where we would go to different places, different campuses for four or
five matches, or they would come to that. So it sort of expanded. Then in
about 1968, there was a national organization to govern women’s sports
at the intercollegiate level, and then that’s when the interest really picked
up. The schedules changed, and we played more. They had national
tournaments, and the track team went to the first national track meet in
San Marcos, Texas. We went by car and packed our peanut butter
sandwiches and jammed in a car and had homemade soup. It was
interesting, but they loved it. You probably could ask any of them, and
they would say that it was, I guess it was like [Charles] Dickens, the best
of times and the worst of times.

Ahrberg

Is there a particular athlete that you worked with closely that you recall,
that stands out in your mind the most? Are there any other athletes from
OSU that you have stayed in contact with?

10

Jones

Well, yes, there are two or three of them that I still have contact with.
There were many of them who could’ve been very good if they had had
the opportunity so I regret that they didn’t. None of them went on
because there was not the opportunity to go in athletics, but if there had
been... One of the women, a very good athlete, was Marilyn
Linsenmeyer who was from Stillwater, who would’ve been a great track
person, a pentathlete or whatever the one where they compete at all
different activities in that event. Mary Kay Hyde, who would’ve been a
wonderful golfer, probably could’ve made the golf tour. Most of them
were just out there to enjoy and be thankful for the opportunity.

Ahrberg

You mentioned in our correspondence about an OSU graduate named
Cynthia Buffington who received her BS in physical education in the late
1960s. Can you tell us a little bit about her? You mentioned that she’s
recognized nationally and internationally as an exercise…

Jones

She was not an athlete. In high school she was a basketball player, but
she was not an athlete. She was, I think, originally a pre-med major. The
physical education majors were so happy and having such a good time
that she changed her major to physical education. She stuck to exercise
physiology and got her PhD at Austin, University of Texas, and now
calls herself a scientist. She is well known for her work with obesity, for
cancer, and for diabetes in relation to obesity. I think she’s just gotten
back from Spain. She has to go back to India for a couple of times this
year. She has a conference in Germany. She really is a powerhouse in
that area, internationally as well as nationally.

Ahrberg

Now, was she on campus when you were there?

Jones

Yes, she was. I think she graduated maybe in ’69, something like that.

Ahrberg

So you were familiar with her. What sports did she play?

Jones

She didn’t.

Ahrberg

She didn’t play any sports?

Jones

No, she was not that athletic.

Ahrberg

Okay.

Jones

But in high school, little town, she was a basketball player, but she was
not an athlete.

Ahrberg

And you’ve kept contact with her through your career, or as part of a…

11

Jones

Just for whatever reason. I still have contact with a young woman I
taught in the ’50s, in junior high school in North Kansas City. So for
whatever reason, the thread is still there.

Ahrberg

What do you think is the difference between the athletes of today,
compared with the ones that you taught?

Jones

They’re bigger. (Laughter)

Ahrberg

They’re bigger. (Laughs)

Jones

They’re bigger. (Laughs) Of course, they’re more skilled. They’re more
talented. It’s not because of their innate ability, but it’s because of the
opportunity they had. Of course, the athletes then were just so happy to
have the opportunity to do a limited amount of traveling and
participating where, now, sixty games for softball or whatever. They
bought their own shoes, their own t-shirts, and now they’re given. I can’t
speak for people like Robin [Ahrberg] and some of the others, which I
know they’re enjoying, and I know for many of them it’s an opportunity
to get an education, whereas they would not have that opportunity. But
these, they came to school first for an education, and then this was just
one of the many opportunities they had. They had a good time, and they
behaved. (Laughter)

Ahrberg

I think we brought this up a little bit. We talked about the athletic
facilities. You said you taught all over campus. Was there a gym that the
girls could…

Jones

The armory was our gym. The armory. Then the Colvin Center was built
in the late ’60s, I think. It came in, and that was the Taj Mahal. I
remember some young man saying that he was going to take his wife on
a honeymoon to the best place where there was an indoor pool, and they
could play racquetball, and they could do all of this. Of course, they
were so pleased to have the Colvin Center.

Ahrberg

Were you on campus at the time the Colvin Center was being built?

Jones

Yes.

Ahrberg

Can you tell me a little bit about that? Do you know how it got started?
What was the driving force behind getting it built?

Jones

I’m sorry. I have no idea except it was really neat. We didn’t have
anything. I mean, there was no space. Gallagher Hall, of course, I know
we practiced track some, early in the season, underneath in the cellar, I
guess, because it had a dirt floor, so we were in there. (Laughter) There

12

was really no place. I have no idea what the men did with their classes,
no idea whatsoever.
Ahrberg

Did you actually get to move into the Colvin Center and have an office
there?

Jones

Yes. I had an office.

Ahrberg

Oh, you had an office? Okay.

Jones

Oh, yes, I had an office. (Laughter) But backing up to Ms. Colvin, she
was such an interesting woman. I remember they were talking about one
semester she was teaching swimming and for some reason couldn’t get
the pool so she taught swimming for about six or seven weeks on dry
land. She would put them on a bench, lie them on a bench. Then they
could do their backstroke and all of this. Nothing was impossible.
(Laughter) We needed to move beyond that. Ruth Lindsey was an
outstanding—the physical education majors really got a good education,
or had the opportunity to, and had very strong programs. The people
who coached were pretty good, but we didn’t have a lot of time.

Ahrberg

What about fencing? Did you have any fencing?

Jones

Ruth Lindsey had fencing, and she loved it. That was her favorite. Yes,
there was fencing.

Ahrberg

I know I had a coach in fencing when I started at OSU. Her name was
Winters.

Jones

Pauline Winters.

Ahrberg

Pauline Winters, that’s right.

Jones

Yes, she came after. So, see, the names are coming back. (Laughs) Yes,
Pauline Winters, she came after I was there in the middle ’60s, I guess.
She came from Pittsburgh, but, yes, she taught fencing. So many of
them, like, Pauline died. Ruth Lindsey died. Ms. Colvin didn’t want to
retire. When she was sixty-five she was forced out because of the age
limit or something. I don’t blame her. She resented it, because she still
had a lot of life and a lot of drive. They brought in Dorothy Coleman
who was a very poor substitute.

Ahrberg

Did the coaches have any input into how the Colvin Center would be
built, as far as the facilities?

Jones

No, that was not to be—athletics was not…

13

Ahrberg

Involved.

Jones

Involved. No. So that wasn’t it. It was all to be learning and recreation.

Ahrberg

When the Colvin Center was built, did it really affect the programs
there? Did they get stronger? Did they take off? Were you able to do
more with the facility? Because you had this state of the art facility, so…

Jones

They probably could offer more classes, but you still had only so many
faculty to do that. It was just that the venue was much better so you
didn’t have to move around. You could have your archery out. You
could step out into the fields and have your golf driving range and all of
this. I’m not sure that it added more programs, but it added to the
programs.

Ahrberg

Did you see a lot more participation, though? People wanting to…

Jones

Oh, yes. Well, it was widely used. It was centered so that the money was
well spent.

Ahrberg

Let’s go back and talk a little bit about your impression of the OSU
campus in Stillwater when you arrived. This is the early 1960s…

Jones

Yes.

Ahrberg

…and we know Stillwater is kind of an isolated little town.

Jones

Yes, it was. (Laughter)

Ahrberg

Tell us what it was like back then, in the 1960s. Probably even more
isolated, but…

Jones

Well, I came from a small town to begin with. The town where I grew
up had about maybe eight hundred people. Didn’t have a stock law or
whatever and so forth, so Stillwater was really a cut above that, but it
was down from Kansas City. I had seen someone in the summer before.
I was taking a class at Central in Edmond and met someone who was a
student at Oklahoma State. Walking on campus with him, and he said,
“Now, at Oklahoma State, we don’t walk on the grass.” (Laughs) He
said, “We always stay on the sidewalk, and you don’t cut across the
campus.” I thought, “Man!” (Laughter) It was a pretty campus. It was a
nice campus, and it was small and friendly and warm. I know it was sort
of isolated, but it was pretty around there. I don’t care—the wind blew
all the time, and I missed it when I left. The wind would blow across the
fields, and the color would come out in the grasses. The dirt in the sunset

14

made for beautiful sunsets. There was just a feeling there, and, of course,
we all hated OU, (laughter) so that brought us together. I was very
impressed with the campus and with the people.
Ahrberg

Well, this is the early 1960s. How were the students? Was there a lot of
talk about Vietnam, the times?

Jones

I look back, and I must have slept through most of that. I remember
some about integration. I know there were more, but I remember only
one black woman, and she was on the field hockey team. Her name was
Brenda Neil. She wasn’t physical education, I don’t think, but she went
on to become a broker and did quite well in New York. When you
traveled, you weren’t with any other ethnic group. You were still with
just the white population. I don’t remember there being—like, at Florida
State at that time, they had sit-ins. They had all that, and I don’t
remember any of that happening at Oklahoma State.

Ahrberg

Very calm campus.

Jones

Very calm campus, yes. In the Midwest it’s different anyway, so the
people are like that.

Ahrberg

Did you know any of the guys in the rodeo club or the gals in the rodeo
club?

Jones

No, but I used to go and cheer for the goat. (Laughter) I felt so sorry for
the goat.

Ahrberg

Cheer for the goat? What was that?

Jones

You know they had goat tying? Oh, and that poor goat! (Laughter) My
favorite sport to watch was wrestling. Loved the wrestling. Loved it. I
thought it was the best sport.

Ahrberg

Was Henry Iba on campus at that time?

Jones

Yes, he was.

Ahrberg

Okay. What was your impression of Mr. Iba?

Jones

Well, of course, I knew he was a great basketball coach, and he did a
good job, but no contact. No contact with him. It was just two different
worlds. Physical education and women, sports from the men.

Ahrberg

Did you use the Student Union? Did you go into the Student Union?

15

Jones

No. No.

Ahrberg

What about the library? Did you ever go to the library?

Jones

Some, but not a lot. But some.

Ahrberg

Did you read the student newspaper, The O’Collegian?

Jones

Yes. Yes, I did. I had forgotten the name of it.

Ahrberg

The O’Colly.

Jones

The O’Colly, yes.

Ahrberg

Did you live on or off campus?

Jones

Lived off campus. First was a little garage apartment on Husband Street.
Let’s see. Then I lived on Gray Street. There was one other, but I can’t
remember.
The students were so different. You’d get up one morning, and they’d
papered the door so that when you opened the door to go out, they had
been there during the night and had papered the door. (Laughter) Or
you’d start to get in your car, and it’d be filled with balloons. (Laughter)
So they always found you.

Ahrberg

What was your mode of transportation back then?

Jones

A car, had a little car.

Ahrberg

You had a car.

Jones

Yes.

Ahrberg

Okay. What places did you like to visit in Stillwater? Were there any
establishments that you visited? I mean, there was Katz Department
Store. (Laughter)

Jones

I was trying to think of what…

Ahrberg

There was Swim’s Campus Shop.

Jones

Yes, yes.

Ahrberg

Did you visit there?

16

Jones

Yes, yes. Of course, I’m trying to remember the name of the dress shop
that one of my landladies worked for.

Ahrberg

Bonnie’s?

Jones

Yes.

Ahrberg

Worked for Bonnie’s?

Jones

Yes. (Laughs) Of course, anyway, there was a little lake north of town,
not Carl Blackwell. That was west.

Ahrberg

Boomer?

Jones

Boomer, yes. Boomer was a good place for picnics and things like that.

Ahrberg

So on the weekends were you primarily in Stillwater? Did you stay
there, or did you travel outside of Stillwater?

Jones

No, really didn’t travel. Usually, during volleyball and track season, we
were always gone traveling on weekends so the weekends were taken up
in that way. In track, we had a track meet at Ozark Christian College in
Springfield, Missouri, very conservative campus. We didn’t have any
money so the young women stayed in the dorm, (laughs) and they were
so amazed. They said they had never seen anybody so poor. They were
so austere. Sometimes the jumping pit would be, like, tires with a tarp
over it. When you high-jumped and you went over the thing, you’re on
sawdust. No wonder they didn’t jump high. They had to come down.

Ahrberg

What was your reason for leaving OSU?

Jones

Well, had a job offer from Florida State. At that time, women’s athletics
was just beginning. Title IX had been passed. It was not enforced, but it
was passed, so they needed someone who would advise students, teach,
and coach for little or nothing. Anyway, it was a change of venue, and it
was an opportunity to come. I had been here, and I liked the campus and
liked the people. It was another opportunity. I really missed Oklahoma
State because I loved the people. They were all so nice and so down to
earth and everything, but I tell you, after Ms. Colvin left, it just wasn’t
the same. (Laughter) It was just too different.

Ahrberg

Billie, I know you continue your involvement in athletics by supporting
the Florida State University softball team, much to their great
appreciation. Can you tell me what you personally have gotten out of
supporting these athletes after your own career has ended?

17

Jones

Well, I know that it helps keep my mind young. It can’t do much for my
body, but it helps keep my mind young and reminds me of a lot of things
and keeps me updated, I guess, to be more accepting of some things, to
be more understanding, not necessarily liking it, but more understanding,
more accepting. Also, to sort of, maybe, let me know that I am playing a
minor role in making a difference for them.

Ahrberg

Billie, I certainly appreciate you taking the time today for this interview
to discuss your life and your career while at Oklahoma State University.
It’s been my sincere pleasure to interview you, but before we close, I’ll
just ask you. Is there anything else you would like to comment about?

Jones

Well, I’m pleased to be a part of this, and I appreciate your asking me. It
gives me an opportunity to talk about some things, some very good
memories, some very good memories, and, also, to bring some of my
pictures that, for whatever reason, I can’t…

Ahrberg

Yes, tell us about the pictures you brought.

Jones

…so that I know where they’re going because they’re history.

Ahrberg

These are pictures you’re bringing to us that you took while you were
there, and they’re of the women.

Jones

Yes, they are primarily of women’s volleyball, track, a few field hockey.

NewsPress.

Jones

NewsPress. We got a lot of ink in the NewsPress. I tell you, they were
good. They’d come out and take pictures. They would write stories and
all of that. You will see, also, with this. Brought this in. The track team
went to the first national intercollegiate track and field championships in
’69. It says who was there, but, also, the names of the young women. We
have pictures of those who won, and the same thing for the first trip the
volleyball team took to the nationals in Miami, Florida, in ’72, I guess,
with that. So just some articles and some pictures and whatever.

Ahrberg

I’m just kind of curious, did any of your teams, while you were a coach,
are there any titles you won or awards you won as coach?

Jones

Of course, we beat everybody on land and sea in Oklahoma on whatever
it was. We were by far the best in this, and then our others, as far as
nationals, the two with which I was connected, the volleyball team, in
pool play, we won two and lost three. Ms. Colvin was just having a fit

The track team, I think we finished fourth in the national track meet with
that.
Ahrberg

Well, thank you again for joining us. It’s been my pleasure to interview
