Jamie Horning
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Jerry Gill
September 10, 2010
Stillwater, Oklahoma
Gill

My name is Jerry Gill. Today is September 10, 2010. I am visiting with
Jamie Donovan Horning in Stillwater, Oklahoma, in her parents’ home.
This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral
History Research Program. Jamie, I know you’re here for Parents’
Weekend, I think?

Horning

Yes.

Gill

I appreciate you taking the time out of the activities to do this interview.

Horning

You’re welcome.

Gill

Jamie, you’re a member of a very special OSU family. If I recall
correctly, five generations of your family have attended Oklahoma State
University, beginning with your great-grandmother, Gay Lynn Albright
Clark. Then your grandmother, Jamie Dunn, your mother, Gay Lynn
Bullock, also graduated OSU, and your son Matthew is now a junior at
Oklahoma State University?

Horning

Yes he is.

Gill

Pretty special. Five generations?

Horning

Yes, we think it is, especially being women going to school. I think
that’s very special.

Gill

Well Jamie, for your great-grandmother, it was very unusual, wasn’t it,
at that time, her wanting to go to college?

4

Horning

Yes, that is right.

Gill

In the 19-teens, as I recall?

Horning

Yes, 1916?

Gill

Speaking of your great-grandmother Clark, what do you remember
about her?

Horning

I remember she was a pretty sharp lady, and until she got ill she seemed
to know what was going on and around. She was very on top of what
was going on with her community. She stayed active in what she could. I
didn’t know her. I mean, I guess she was probably in her late sixties,
seventies, when I was old enough to remember besides being a little
child.

Gill

How old were you when she died?

Horning

I think I was probably early twenties.

Gill

So you did get a chance to grow up knowing her.

Horning

Yes. Actually, every time we came up to Stillwater to see Grandmother
Dunn, we would drive over and see Great-Grandmother Clark.

Gill

Did she ever tell any stories about her time at OSU or, then, of course,
Oklahoma A&M?

Horning

Well, she more told about afterwards because she taught in a little oneroom schoolhouse, and she had several kids from, like, six to as old as
they could be. A lot of them would leave when they were thirteen or so
to go work in the field. She talked a little bit about that and how she had
fun doing that, teaching the kids.

Gill

So she graduated in education and was a schoolteacher most of her
career and most of her life?

Horning

Right. What I understand was it was kind of a special certificate. You
went, I think, about two years, so it was specialized, and it was kind of a
teaching certificate.

Gill

But she never talked about Old Central or any of her classes or
anything?

Horning

I remember she talked about knowing it was there and that was kind of
the only thing that was there. It would be all new to her if she went back

5

and saw all the growth.
Gill

It would be amazing, wouldn’t it? (Laughs) It’s amazing if you haven’t
been here in ten years what has happened.

Horning

Oh, yes.

Gill

Did your Grandmother Dunn talk to you about her OSU experiences?

Horning

Yes, she did. She talked about going—now, she went to school in the
late Depression. She talks a lot about having just a few dresses, and she
would change them out, going to OSU. Again, it was a little more
sophisticated then. She got her degree in administrative. It was a fouryear degree. She learned all the things that we don’t use anymore like
longhand, shorthand, and a Dictaphone. (Laughs) Yes, she learned all
that. Of course, she met her future husband there, so she talks about that.
Dances, parties, and the fun stuff.

Gill

As I recall from conversation, did your great-grandmother meet her
husband at OSU, or did she meet him after she graduated?

Horning

I don’t think she met him there. I don’t know when she met him, but she
met him later.

Gill

So your grandfather, then, also attended Oklahoma State, and they met
there?

Horning

Yes. I don’t really remember much about that, but he was older, and he
actually enlisted. He went there, and then he enlisted, and he actually
was in World War II.

Gill

So your mom graduated from Oklahoma State? You mentioned earlier
before we started, this five generations, especially being women coming
through is very interesting. What do you remember about her OSU
experience?

Horning

I remember she always talked about college is really important, and she
was very glad she went. She likes socials, so she did talk about that quite
a bit, (Laughter) but just meeting people and having a good a time, and
it’s a good school. I guess even if you live here growing up, it’s a
privilege to go.

Gill

Were there any traditions at that time that she talked about?

Horning

I don’t remember a lot, but we had yearbooks. See, I got to look at my
parents’ yearbooks from college, so you flipped and saw all the dresses

6

and all the different events.
Gill

The hairdos.

Horning

Yes, the hair and the glasses, the cat-eye glasses. We looked through
things, and that is how we knew a little bit about it as kids growing up.

Gill

Let’s talk about you for a little bit. Where did you grow up?

Horning

I grew up, basically, in Longview, Texas. I was born in Sapulpa,
Oklahoma, and then my parents moved to Odessa. I lived there about
five years in Odessa, Texas. Then my dad got a job with Gulf Oil, and a
subsidiary is called Warren Petroleum, so he worked there. We moved to
Longview, Texas. So from second grade until I graduated, we lived in
Longview.

Gill

So you lived in Texas most of your life growing up.

Horning

Right. I think the folks in the archives will figure that out with my voice.
(Laughter)

Gill

Was there a story about how you got back to Stillwater?

Horning

Yes, there is a little story. I actually went to Texas A&M my first year. I
enjoyed it. My high school was 320 that graduated, so it wasn’t small.
But there was only a small group that went from high school to college.
There were two or three friends of mine, good friends, that were going to
A&M. I kind of decided to leave late, so I went to A&M, but in that
transition, that summer that I graduated, my dad took another job with
Gulf Oil that was a promotion. It was overseas work, so my family
ended up moving to Oklahoma. Therefore, after my freshman year, they
really wanted me to transfer. I said, “Okay.” I didn’t start until my
sophomore year at Oklahoma State.

Gill

Where were your parents living in that area, or at least your mother?

Horning

They were right outside of Tulsa in Sapulpa, so kind of moved back to
where I was born.

Gill

Full circle.

Horning

Roundabout way, yes. It took a little while, but I came. (Laughs) So I
can actually say I am a double Aggie. I tell people that.

Gill

Well, it’s quite a bit of a social pride. You started out as a Texas A&M
Aggie, but it wasn’t much of a transition with your family being

7

Oklahoma State Aggies.
Horning

Right. And they’re real similar, I mean, as far as they’re both
agricultural mechanical schools.

Gill

Do you remember what year you enrolled at Oklahoma State?

Horning

Nineteen eighty-one.

Gill

Your major was…

Horning

Chemical engineering.

Gill

There probably weren’t a lot of chemical engineering women at that
time, were there?

Horning

Actually, there wasn’t a lot, but there were four in my class of thirty or
thirty-five. So there was a little bit, but that’s when they were really
starting. I think they were actually trying to, in a way, recruit if there
were women that were making good grades because some of the other
engineering disciplines had more. Now I understand it is probably 50
percent or more.

Gill

Was Ruth Erbar in charge, or did she help with the women’s
engineering program at that time?

Horning

Yes. She was there. I don’t remember her being in charge of the
women’s engineering, but she was there as a professor. We had a class
with her. She taught one of our classes.

Gill

Do you recall some of the professors that you worked with? Were there
some professors or administrators that had influence on you while you
were a student?

Horning

I kind of laugh because the answer is yes and no. (Laughs) In
engineering, I’m not sure they’re really there to influence you more than
torture you. (Laughter) That’s not their forte. They all taught well. They
all wanted the kids to succeed, and they pushed us. I was in a class of—I
think it’s a little unique, but it probably happens every four or five years,
but my particular class had some really smart kids in it. That is why I
think they kind of punished you, because there were two 4.0s in my
class. There were many of them that had 3.5 averages and better in
engineering, so it was almost like they were going to push us just to
break us a little bit. It didn’t happen, but… (Laughs)

Gill

Congratulations.

8

Horning

Dr. [Kenneth] Bell, he was there. Both of the Erbars were there, but Dr.
[John] Erbar, he was teaching graduate school students at that time. Dr.
Willis, I think he went to the other university. He moved on. (Laughs)
There were a few others, but they were all good.

Gill

We talked about Billy Crynes. Was he there at that time?

Horning

Yes, but he more taught the graduate students.

Gill

He was head of the School of Chemical Engineering?

Horning

Right. Good group of professors. You know, you came out of there
prepared. I mean…

Gill

Where did you live on campus?

Horning

I actually was in a sorority. I was in Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority
house. When I transferred, I was actually a pledge at Texas A&M and
initiated there, so when I moved up, I moved into the house. I lived
there, and my fifth year, I lived in some apartments on Hester that are no
longer there. They were actually pretty new, but they were very close to
the stadium, so they razed them to put in the new parking lot and
stadium.

Gill

What about some of the other activities you were involved in,
organizations, student groups?

Horning

I was in American Institute of Chemical Engineering student chapter. I
was an officer and had a lot of fun. They had three or four events during
the year, so we actually did some social events. That was a lot of fun. Of
course, I was in my sorority, and we did philanthropy. We did parties,
social events, and Homecoming. Lots of pomping, staying up all night,
yes. (Laughter)

Gill

It’s an OSU tradition.

Horning

It is actually, I think, from what I have seen, a little better organized than
when we were going to school. Not that we were unorganized, but I
think we thought we could get everything done in a much shorter time
period. They seem to start earlier here and be a little more—I am sure
they stay up all night, too, but it seems a little less intense than it was
when I was going to school.

Gill

What do you remember about Engineering Week? There were usually a
lot of activities, I remember, in that era. Were you involved in any of

9

those?
Horning

I actually don’t remember a lot about that. I remember lots of homework
and late nights. (Laughter) There was always something going on. If you
wanted to participate, there’s something to participate in. It’s up to you
to choose what you want to do.

Gill

What were some of the favorite student activities at that time?

Horning

Going to the games. They were always fun, basketball and football
games. That’s fun, and just hanging out with friends, that’s fun. The
engineers kind of took over the library a lot. We had our little study
groups in the basement where the tables are, so we did that. I think I just
had fun being with people. I had fun in the sorority even if it was just
being in the house. There was always something going on.

Gill

What were the favorite student hangouts at that time on campus and off
campus?

Horning

I guess the one is probably the Student Union, just to go get a cup of
coffee or a coke and just sit. The Fox, and then Eskimo Joe’s was just
getting popular then. It really wasn’t—in fact, I went with someone, my
boyfriend at the time, and we lived pretty close. He said, “Let’s go over
here.” I said, “That looks like a place we don’t need to go.” We went in
there, and I was like, “I don’t want to be here.” (Laughter) But he had
apparently bought it at that time, and it wasn’t a hit with the kids yet, but
it quickly became.

Gill

What about Washington Street, better known as the Strip?

Horning

I actually didn’t go down there that much. It was just me, but that was
always popular of course.

Gill

You’re not just saying that because your mom is in the room, right?

Horning

No, no. Actually I didn’t. I actually didn’t go down there. (Laughs) I tell
her that I am old enough now I can go. (Laughter) But I remember the
kids would go get hotdogs, which I think that’s still here, Coney Island.

Gill

Yes, Coney Island.

Horning

Oh yes, there was always popular folks. See, I never saw Garth Brooks,
and he was here when I was here. (Laughs)

Gill

Didn’t get an autograph, huh?

10

Horning

No, no.

Gill

Along those lines, what were some of your favorite memories at
Oklahoma State as you look back and think about your time at OSU?

Horning

I think just going to school here. There wasn’t anything in particular.
Before I forget to say it, I did not discover the Dairy Barn until I think it
was either late junior year or my senior year, so I really missed out on
that. (Laughs)

Gill

And for the archives, can you explain what the old Dairy Building, what
you called that?

Horning

Well, it was the agricultural students, and they had ice cream, cheese,
and milk, but everybody went for the ice cream. I just didn’t know about
it. I guess I was buried in the sand or something. Finally, we were
talking about ice cream, and somebody said, “Well, you have to go there
because that is where the best ice cream is.” And I was like, “What are
you talking about?” My husband now, (we were dating at the time) we
started going over there, and I gained a lot of weight. (Laughter)

Gill

Did you ever have any of the half and half, the half chocolate, half
regular milk?

Horning

No, I never did. I am not a big milk fan, but I like everything else,
cheese, ice cream, and yes. I think some of the memories are that kind of
thing. You find out something fun, somebody talks about it. We drank a
lot of quart Koolies from the QuikTrip. We’d stop by there. (Laughs)

Gill

It was the Red Bull of that era.

Horning

Oh, yes. We’d go get a quart Koolie. I think just being with people and
meeting people, that was a lot of fun.

Gill

Do any administrators stand out in your mind, presidents, deans,
department heads, people you remember?

Horning

No, not really. In fact, when we were going to school and things I can
look back on when I’m visiting, I don’t know if that was a financially
bad time for Oklahoma State at that time because when you are going to
school there, you’re not paying attention. I do remember it looked a little
more run down than it looks now or five years ago or even ten years ago.
It looked like it was just kind of suffering.

Gill

So what year did you graduate, then?

11

Horning

Eighty-five.

Gill

And ’85 really was right in the middle of that bust.

Horning

I think it was, yes. I think it was kind of suffering.

Gill

There probably were some deferred maintenance, I’m sure.

Horning

But we would laugh about the flowers dying at the Student Union.
Somebody would plant the flowers, and they’d turn brown. But, again,
we weren’t really paying attention that much. It’s so much better. I can
tell that they try to manage the money and get endowments and trusts.

Gill

Did you have some scholarship support when you were in school?

Horning

No, I actually didn’t.

Gill

The 4.0s got that?

Horning

They probably did. (Laughter)

Gill

Jamie, I didn’t ask you earlier about brothers and sisters in your family.
Did any of those attend Oklahoma State?

Horning

Yes, I have two sisters and a brother. The sister that is next to me,
Melissa, she did go to Oklahoma State and graduate, and she met her
husband, and he graduated also. I think he was maybe one of the first in
his family to go here. She graduated in computer science.

Gill

Was she the only one?

Horning

Yes, the other two went to the other A&M. They both went to Texas
A&M.

Gill

As you indicated, your husband—did he graduate the same year? Did
you all graduate together in ’85?

Horning

Yes, we did. We were in the same class.

Gill

Can you share about your professional life and journey after you left
Oklahoma State?

Horning

Well, as you mentioned, early ’85 was not a good year to graduate,
especially in the engineering field with OPEC [Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries] and all the things that were going on.
We were both real fortunate. Our professors tried very hard to bring

12

companies on campus and recruit for us and help place everybody. I got
a job with Factory Mutual, and it is a business insurance company. It is
all over the world. I moved to St. Louis, and my husband and I were
dating at the time. He got a job with Texas Eastman in Longview, Texas,
where I grew up, just coincidentally. We still continued to date, and then
he asked me to marry him. He tried really hard to get a job in St. Louis,
and I was seeing what was available in Longview. We ended up moving
to Longview and getting married. Then I worked for another company,
Thiokol, for a few years. He got a phone call to be interviewed in
Charlotte, North Carolina, just kind of out of the blue in ’91. We decided
that sounded like a good deal, so we moved to Charlotte, North Carolina.
Then I went to go work for Bechtel. I went to work for Bechtel in ’92.
I’ve been working for them since 1992. We’ve moved a little bit, yes.
(Laughs)
Gill

Then you moved to…

Horning

Moved to Beaumont, Texas, in ’99, both with work, both associated with
work. He was asked to transfer, and then I was asked to come to a job in
the Beaumont area.

Gill

Will you share a little bit about what you do there with Bechtel?

Horning

I am an environmental safety and health manager for Bechtel, and I am
normally the manager in the field, so if the project is in the field that is
what it normally is. People tease me because I am a woman. They say,
“Do you like telling the people what to do all the time?” I said, “Yes,
that’s kind of fun, (Laughter) telling a bunch of men what to do all the
time.” I just set up the programs and the processes out in the field and,
yes, tell people what to do. But hopefully I am telling people the right
things to do. I am currently in Houston. I am currently in the office
managing a pipeline project from the office. I do travel a little bit. That’s
where I am now.

Gill

Your kids—I know you have Matthew, but are there other children you
have?

Horning

Yes. Matthew is at Oklahoma State. He is a junior. Madeline is a senior
in high school.

Gill

Is she going to be the fifth girl [to attend OSU], maybe?

Horning

She’s thinking about it. (Laughter)

Gill

Are you working on her a little bit?

13

Horning

Yes. She is a very good soccer player, and we would like her to go to
OSU and play soccer. She’s not against going. She has got a couple of
soccer offers, and we are going to see how that pans out.

Gill

So Matthew makes the fifth generation to enroll at Oklahoma State.

Horning

Right.

Gill

Let me hold that thought for just a minute. It is sort of interesting. We
have interviewed your family line, and it has been women, as we’ve
indicated.

Horning

Right, yes.

Gill

Your great-great-grandmother, and then your grandmother, and your
mother, and yourself. If you had five women in the family, five
generations, it would be pretty special, wouldn’t it?

Horning

Oh yes.

Gill

I’m sure there are not too many five-generation women families in
Oklahoma State University history.

Horning

I don’t know. I would think not. I think that would maybe be something.
I think that would be difficult because the college was just starting.
People kind of move and go about different places.

Gill

We are excited to have Matthew at Oklahoma State. Can you tell us a
little bit about Matthew? He’s a junior here?

Horning

He’s a junior. He’s an architectural engineering major. He loves it. He
loves all those things. He is probably more active than Jim or I were.
(Laughs) That was one of the things I told him. I think I did miss out on
some things because I actually had switched majors. I was pre-med and
switched to engineering, so I was just behind. I was behind in every
class, and I was trying to catch up. He entered in knowing what he
wanted to do, so he’s got a pretty good workload. He’s very involved.
He’s in a fraternity, but he loves to play intramural sports and volunteers
for quite a bit, so he’s having a good time.

Gill

Student volunteerism is really strong at Oklahoma State. It’s great that
he is involved in that. Did you say which fraternity he’s in?

Horning

He’s a Sigma Chi. I think they push him a little bit. They’re always
talking about if you join something, then you need to run for an office
and not just join, but participate and be a part of it.

14

Gill

So Matthew was in the Beaumont, Texas, area.

Horning

Yes.

Gill

Did he have a choice about Oklahoma State, or…

Horning

Oh, yes.

Gill

I say that jokingly, but was he excited about coming to Oklahoma State?

Horning

Actually, we told him, “You choose where you want to go. If you have a
major you like already in high school, you need to find a school that has
that. Don’t go to a school that is not going to have what you need
because then you will be miserable and probably switch anyway.” He’s
wanted to do architecture engineering for quite some time, so he knew
they had a good program. He’s been pretty set on it for a while.

Gill

And that’s good that it is a good, strong program at Oklahoma State.

Horning

Oh yes.

Gill

It’s great that it worked out for him. Having attended Oklahoma State
University, how has that impacted your life?

Horning

I think it’s a good, solid school. It’s something you can be proud of,
going and graduating. I don’t think it affects my life hugely. It’s just the
fact that you can finish and go and have a career. There are a lot of
people from OSU in Texas, and you run into them. It’s just nice to be
part of something that you see in other people.

Gill

Are you a member of the Alumni Association?

Horning

Oh yes.

Gill

Got that orange sticker on the back of your car?

Horning

Right, yes.

Gill

All right! I had to ask that question. I was the alumni director of twentythree years.

Horning

Oh, okay. We pay every year. (Laughter)

Gill

Just get a life membership, and then you don’t have to worry about it!

15

Horning

That’s right.

Gill

At family reunions or get-togethers of the family, does discussion about
Oklahoma State ever come up?

Horning

Oh I think so, yes. Especially with my mother living in Stillwater, it’s
hard not to. (Laughter)

Gill

Are there some kinds of generational stories that you remember or some
different experiences?

Horning

I don’t really remember too many.

Gill

So none of these favorite stories that are told and retold?

Horning

Not about Oklahoma State, but my grandmother Dunn does talk a lot
about dances and, of course, that was around the war, right around that
time, also, in the Depression, and they didn’t have as much. I guess the
money wasn’t there, but you could still socialize and have fun at the
dances. We didn’t go in Theta Pond. We didn’t walk on the bushes and
everything. I heard all about that, but we never did any of it. (Laughs)

Gill

You were a serious student, it sounds like to me. (Laughter)

Horning

That’s right! (Laughs) I think the only excitement that happened that I
can talk about, (and I get a tickle out of this) but Engineering North, the
stairs for an engineering building, they are really horribly designed, and
you fall up the stairs because the rise and the run is not correct. We’d
always watch the students, and you would fall flat on your face.

Gill

Oh, falling up the stairs?

Horning

Falling up, yes, but we’d watch people. Of course, we fell too, but you’d
watch people, and you would just go straight down because there is no
catching yourself. That’s my one big memory. (Laughter) I mean, there
are always little things you catch. I had a roommate in the sorority, and
we had a five-girl room. There were different sized rooms, and we had a
five-girl room. One girl was a very serious student, and she would stay
up all night long studying, but she would fall asleep, and she’d have her
light on. When I’d wake up because the light was in my face, I would
turn off her light and then she would turn it back on. Then one day I was
walking in the library, and she was out stone cold in the library, so I
went and woke her up, and I was like, “No, no, no! No sleeping during
the day. You need to sleep at night.” (Laughter)

Gill

Tough! As you kind of reflect back on the experiences, you talked a little

16

bit about different times in the 1910s and the Depression Era, and then
the dip when you were in the ’80s. As members of your family have
talked about their OSU experiences, how are their experiences different
at OSU?
Horning

I think the difference is just the growth when they talked about it
because talking about where it is just two or three classrooms, and
prairie, and I guess some of the places they lived. So I guess when you
hear from everybody, you hear how it’s grown and what’s come about,
and the majors and the different things that they offered. I think that is
the thing I remember.

Gill

What stayed the same? The things you think about at Oklahoma State,
what sort of stayed the same through the generations?

Horning

I think the spirit of the school. And their vision, what they want to be as
a school has probably stayed the same. Yes, just conservative,
agricultural, mechanical, producing a good student. That seems to have
stayed the same.

Gill

The land-grant tradition.

Horning

Yes.

Gill

You said that an A&M school was kind of a people school.

Horning

I think the jokes have stayed the same against OU. (Laughter) They
probably have not changed.

Gill

Good point. How proud are you of how Oklahoma State has grown
through the years since you graduated?

Horning

It is good that it has. That is always nice to see that it could sustain.

Gill

As an alumna of the university, how do you feel about all of the facilities
on campus?

Horning

That is always nice. Again, saying I was here during the ’80s, it is
always nice to see that there is some money coming in and there are
good things happening. I think that’s good, and I think that helps the
school. I’ve been on school boards. I was on the high school school
board, and alumni are very important. They feed the school, they help
people come in, and they literally [provide] money. They really support
the school, so I think that is important that that’s happening.

Gill

And the flowers are growing now?

17

Horning

The flowers are growing. (Laughter)

Gill

That’s good.

Horning

I see the flowers. (Laughs)

Gill

Oklahoma State is expanding, it is growing, and it is changing, but what
would you hope would stay the same about Oklahoma State?

Horning

I think the students, the people, the staff, just again the same, I don’t
know if you would call them traditions, but the same culture. I think, like
you said, the land-grant philosophy. It’s a conservative school, and I
think it should stay that way. There are enough liberal schools. They can
stay on the East and West Coast. (Laughter)

Gill

What strengths do you think Oklahoma State needs to build on going
forward? You said you had been on a school board and you kind of
understand how physical plants, curriculum, and how things need to
grow. How do you think Oklahoma State is going to need to change in
the future to remain a great university?

Horning

I think they just have to keep up. They have to keep up with technology.
They have to keep up with what the students are getting or not getting in
high school and keep attracting—you know, they want to keep
Oklahoma kids. They don’t want them to go off into other schools,
which they can, because physically it’s just not that far of a drive. Just as
a little background, Texas has a 10 percent rule. The top 10 percent can
go to any college in Texas and be accepted. Well, that has actually
caused a lot of kids to go to Oklahoma State, which is good. That is a
good thing, but Oklahoma doesn’t need to do something like that.
You’re going to drive kids out. My kids went to a parochial school,
which was a preparatory school, and that actually hurt that school a little
bit because people were nervous sending their kids there. If they were
not in the top 10 percent, they weren’t going to get in somewhere. It is a
negative thing, and I would encourage Oklahoma not to do that because
it drives kids away.

Gill

How do you feel about the importance of Oklahoma State families that
have had two or three generations or more that are now living out of
state? How do you feel about OSU being open and welcoming and
recruiting students out of state, typically children of the alumni, to come
back to Oklahoma State?

Horning

Yes, that is good. I just wish they gave us a little bit more money.
(Laughs) Matthew has a scholarship, but the Alumni Scholarship is

18

actually pretty poor. It doesn’t really make a dent in out-of-state. We are
paying out-of-state. If I could plug that—if we’ve got this many
generations I don’t think my son should be paying out-of-state tuition,
but we still do it. We still support it.
Gill

Have you ever been engaged in any of the alumni activities, attended
any of the events?

Horning

We haven’t really. In Beaumont there’s not a big group. Houston’s got a
really active group. There’s a handful of Oklahoma State people. We try
to do things when we can. We support it through membership, and read
the online newsletter is how we find out what is going on.

Gill

Where do you get most of your information about Oklahoma State?
What are your sources?

Horning

The newsletters. There is a parent newsletter, and then there is actually
the OSU Alumni Newsletter.

Gill

Electronic newsletter.

Horning

I think we’ve even got the sports. We get a lot of things. (Laughs) I think
we get plenty of information.

Gill

In your opinion, is it important for alumni to stay connected to
Oklahoma State University? You’ve lived literally all over the world
almost, but certainly throughout the United States. Is it important to stay
connected?

Horning

Oh, I think it is. There’s always a common ground. My sorority is the
same way. There’s always a common ground. You can go to any town,
and you can find somebody. One of the first people I met when I moved
to Beaumont was actually a Kappa, which was a little odd. (Laughs) She
was married to a husband named Jim, and my husband’s named Jim.
They’ve become our friends, but you always have that bond of
something.

Gill

Do you get back to Stillwater very often?

Horning

Once or twice a year. We try to make Parents’ Weekend, and I come up
for Mom’s Weekend for the sororities and fraternities.

Gill

Can you tell me a little bit about some of the activities for Parents’
Weekend and Mom’s Weekend?

Horning

Well, for Parents’ Weekend, we participate in the Dad’s, so I am kind of

19

up here—I don’t really count. (Laughter) The Sigma Chi fraternity puts
on a pretty nice golf tournament and a dinner and then the tailgate, so we
try to participate in that. We walk around the campus and see what’s
new, and my son shows me all the places he’s been. He’s done the rave
thing. He says he’s not on the video, but you all can watch him. He’s on
there. (Laughs) When they run in there and do that rave thing at night,
(Laughter) he’s done that before. But, yes, we just kind of relax because
my family is here. We see my grandmother.
Gill

What’s impressed you the most about changes in the campus? You said
you go on campus and look around. What has changed in your mind
most?

Horning

I think just the growth. I’m glad they can still grow and that there’s still
the student body. You’ve got to have the students here. Not really
anything in particular. T. Boone Pickens Stadium.

Gill

It’s a pretty impressive stadium, isn’t it?

Horning

It’s a nice stadium, but we always tell folks that—I know a lot of folks
just from the Big 12 because I work with a lot of them. They cannot
stand Gallagher because of the way it’s so loud. So I guess that’s the
thing that impresses me. They don’t like playing up here. None of those
teams like playing in Gallagher Iba Hall. It’s very loud, it’s very
intimidating, and there’s a lot of students. They do not like playing up
here, which is fun.

Gill

I’m not sure how many, but there are very few five-generation OSU
families, and as we talked about earlier, particularly when you’ve got
four generations of strong women. Is that special to you when you think
about that?

Horning

Oh yes. I am really proud of what they did. It just doesn’t happen. Even
teaching was very important on the frontier back then and to go there,
and her family didn’t have a lot of money. They were farmers, and they
did well, but to send their daughter off to school to do that was a big
thing back then. And even my grandmother, again, that was in the late
’30s, but again, not everybody got to do that. She likes to tell the story
about having three dresses and that’s all she had. But to go off, that’s a
big thing, and graduate and have a certificate. Even my mother, I mean
there still wasn’t a lot of women going even in the late ’50s, early ’60s.
That was not the thing to do.

Gill

When you’re talking to friends or other OSU people, does it ever come
up in conversations? Do people find out that it’s been four, five
generations in a row like that?

20

Horning

Yes. I’m pretty proud of it. I like to tell them.

Gill

What is their response when they hear?

Horning

“Wow!” You know, that it’s unusual. It’s very unusual.

Gill

How did Matthew feel about that? I guess he sort of knew about the
family history. When he was enrolling as the fifth generation, was he
excited about that?

Horning

I think he thinks it’s neat, but he’s too young in a way. He’ll get out, and
I think in five or ten years he’ll appreciate it a lot more. I think it was
just for him to go here, he really likes a lot of the traditions. So he likes
to go to all the different places, and he likes the football. He actually
leaves his tailgate party, his little Sigma Chi tailgate party, early because
he wants to get a good seat. (Laughs) He doesn’t want to be stuck up too
high. He wants to see the action, you know. He makes it a point to be
early and make sure he’s right where the action is. He has cowboy boots.
(Laughter) Beaumont, Texas, people wear cowboy boots and everything,
but it’s more Cajun influence. There are not a lot of hunters and
fishermen there, but it’s not really a cowboy influence there in southeast
Texas. He actually got up here, and he had to have some cowboy boots. I
wanted to buy them before he got up here, but he said, “No, no, no, no,
no, no.” I said, “Oh, no. You’ve got to have some.” So he’s got his
cowboy boots now. Not sure how much he dances with them, but he’s
got his boots.

Gill

Can he do line dancing yet?

Horning

Yes, I think he gets out and does it. He says he goes, but I don’t know
how much he does.

Gill

Jamie, it’s been great having this conversation. What have we left out?
What have we not talked about, about your family and OSU that we
need to cover?

Horning

I think you’ve covered everything. I just think it’s real interesting.
There’s a picture of Jim’s side of the family (we haven’t talked about
him) where they all had their OSU shirts on. That’s kind of fun to see.

Gill

What about his family, quickly? How many of his…

Horning

He’s one of six brothers and sisters, and they all went.

Gill

Six of them?

21

Horning

Yes.

Gill

Wow.

Horning

And they all graduated.

Gill

Did his parents go?

Horning

His parents did not go. His parents are from Kansas, and they went to
school in Kansas, but they moved to Bartlesville. They’re all very, very
smart and could’ve gone different places, but they all went [to OSU].
Two have master’s from Oklahoma State, so they stayed on to get
master’s.

Gill

Any of their kids in the next generation?

Horning

They’re actually just not quite old enough yet. (Laughs)

Gill

Working on them? (Laughs)

Horning

Yes, there’s a lot of kids. Let’s see, one married an Oklahoma State
graduate. They met here. Myself and Jim graduated, and then one of his
sisters married a man that graduated from Oklahoma State.

Gill

There are a lot of OSU folks in your families.

Horning

There certainly is, and they actually have a daughter. Jim’s the oldest, so
Matthew’s the oldest grandchild.

Gill

So there’s…

Horning

Yes, there is a niece that’s one year younger than Madeline, so two years
from now we’ll see if they go to OSU. I’m sure some will. I’m sure their
parents will want them to go.

Gill

Jamie, thanks I appreciate it very much.
