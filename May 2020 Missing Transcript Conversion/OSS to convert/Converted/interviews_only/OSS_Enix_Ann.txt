Ann Enix
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Jacob Sherman
October 22, 2010
Stillwater, Oklahoma
Sherman

My name is Jacob Sherman. Today is October 22, 2010. I’m here at the
OSU Alumni Center interviewing Mrs. Ann Enix. Mrs. Enix is here for
her fiftieth-year class reunion, class of 1960. I want to welcome you
back and congratulations on your fiftieth year celebration.

Enix

Thank you.

Sherman

Let us begin discussing where you grew up and your family situation
growing up, like how many brothers and sisters that you had.

Enix

Well, I was born and raised in Gould, Oklahoma, which is in Harmon
County in southwest Oklahoma. I have three brothers, one who is older
than I am and then twin brothers that are younger than I am. My father
was a farmer, and my mother was a homemaker until I was ready to
come to Oklahoma State, and went back to teaching. She was a high
school math teacher.

Sherman

What kind of farm did you grow up on?

Enix

We had wheat and cotton. This was back in the era when the schools in
that part of the state would let out in the fall for what we call “cotton
picking vacation,” and we would be out of school for like six weeks to
pick cotton. (Laughter)

Sherman

Did you, yourself, pick cotton?

Enix

Yes, I did. That’s how I made my money to pay my little extra expenses
during the school year until the next spring.

4

Sherman

And how many hours a day would you be out in the field?

Enix

From the time we had had breakfast in the morning, if the cotton was dry
enough to pick, until late in the evening. It was an all-day job.

Sherman

Did you raise any animals on your farm?

Enix

We had some animals. Dad had a few cows that he milked by hand, so
he was up very early every morning. We had a few pigs. My brothers did
raise show pigs in 4-H and FFA, and chickens, but not a real large
operation in that area.

Sherman

Did you participate in 4-H?

Enix

Yes, I was very active in 4-H.

Sherman

What activities did you do?

Enix

Well, I could not settle myself on any one activity, so all of the ones
involving homemaking, clothing, canning, cooking, food preparation,
home improvement. When it was record-book time, instead of filling one
out in clothing or that, I filled mine out, and it was called Girls Record.
My last year it was called Girls Home Economics. I did go to national
and was one of the six national winners in Girls Home Economics that
year.

Sherman

Congratulations.

Enix

Thank you.

Sherman

So you went to the national competition?

Enix

I went to Chicago, rode the train, yes.

Sherman

And what was that experience like?

Enix

For a small-town girl, (Laughter) it was a lifetime experience. I was in
school here at the time. It was my first semester, and so I had to miss
classes in order to attend. Just going, being in a large city, going to all
kinds of meetings, all kinds of dinners was really exciting.

Sherman

Where was that at?

Enix

It was in Chicago.

Sherman

Where? Was that at the…

5

Enix

I’m not sure. I don’t remember exactly where it was.

Sherman

What other chores did you have on the farm?

Enix

Well, I helped Mother with the cooking for the farmhands. When it was
summertime and harvest time, of course, you had the fellows coming in,
one relieving the other, so you were feeding meals almost all day long. If
they could not get home for the meal, you were packing a picnic lunch
and taking it to the fields for them, but as far as in high school, having a
job outside of the home, I did not.

Sherman

Were these big meals?

Enix

Oh yes. Fried steak, fried chicken. The meat you usually raised on the
farm.

Sherman

And was this for the thrashers, or was this for cotton, or was this for
both?

Enix

Well, it was mainly for the wheat harvest. When it came cotton time, I
was out in the field with them, and usually Mother would be home fixing
the noon meal for us.

Sherman

Did you have a garden?

Enix

We had a garden, yes. We did not have a well or much way to water it,
but anything that we could not eat fresh, we did can.

Sherman

So what kinds of vegetables or fruits?

Enix

Tomatoes, beans. One year we had potatoes, and there were little
potatoes that we canned. Fruits. A lot of times we’d go to the orchard
and pick pears or peaches or cherries, and then we would go ahead and
can those.

Sherman

What county was that again?

Enix

It was in Harmon County.

Sherman

Now, did you participate in the fair down there?

Enix

Yes. I would have exhibits of clothing, home improvement, which might
be a tablecloth or pillowcases, canning, the gardening, if we had things
coming out of the garden that year. I did have some poultry, which was
the only animals, as the girl, I was allowed to raise for show.

6

Sherman

Oh, I did not know that.

Enix

Well, that was my folks. Some of the other girls raised livestock, sheep,
pork.

Sherman

Rabbits?

Enix

Yes, but I helped with the chickens. My brothers helped with the pork,
and we didn’t raise any of the cattle for show.

Sherman

Now, did you sell the chickens at auction at the fair?

Enix

No, at that time we didn’t. Just raised them, showed them, and then took
them back home.

Sherman

How big was your high school?

Enix

In my graduating class, there were sixteen of us.

Sherman

Sixteen.

Enix

Yes, and we were a very close class. In fact, for our fiftieth reunion we
had thirteen of the sixteen back.

Sherman

Wow. Did you have a high school football team?

Enix

No, we didn’t because we were out of school in football season.

Sherman

Oh yes, during cotton picking season.

Enix

Yes. Baseball, basketball was a very, very large sport. I didn’t play any
sports. I was not any good in the sports area, so I didn’t participate other
than maybe watch.

Sherman

Was there a homecoming celebration for your high school then?

Enix

Yes, after you graduated there was a homecoming. It was always the
Saturday of Easter weekend. Only graduates could attend for a long time
because we didn’t have space, but now since we lost our high school in
1990, anyone who has attended the school is allowed to come back to
the alumni’s get-together, and it’s now been moved to the week after
Easter. So we go every year instead of every five or ten years.

Sherman

And like you said, it sounded like a lot of people come back for that?

7

Enix

Oh they do, they do. They really do.

Sherman

Did you come up to OSU prior to your college for the [4-H] Roundup?

Enix

Yes, I came up every year from the time I was twelve years old until I
came up here as a student.

Sherman

Can you share a little bit about those experiences?

Enix

It was something we looked forward to, and being from a small town
where all of our schools, grade school, junior high and high school, were
on the same piece of property, to a large campus like this, you just felt
like it was overwhelming, but they guided you around and got you to
your different contests. We usually had, depending on what we had won
in the county, a demonstration, a style review, a speech to give, different
judging contests to go to. Every year, they had one of the big Clay Potts
barbecues for us, and it was because of those experiences that I decided
to come to Oklahoma State, then Oklahoma A&M, for my schoolwork.

Sherman

Did you participate in the state fair at all?

Enix

Yes, I did participate in the state fair. Of course, to have an item entered
in the state fair, you had to win first place in the county, and then based
on the points you got for your entries there, you could win a trip to the
state fair. We actually stayed on the fairgrounds in dormitories for, I
think it was four days and participated in judging contests and lectures.
Of course, we always had time for the midway and the grandstand. We
went as a group to the grandstand, and usually they had chairs set down
in the infield for us.

Sherman

What building was that competition in at the state fair?

Enix

They had what they called the 4-H Building.

Sherman

How is that different than the Roundup? Was the Roundup open to every
4-Her?

Enix

No, only, I believe, twelve boys and twelve girls from each county could
come to 4-H Roundup at that time. I don’t believe that many from each
county went to the state fair.

Sherman

Yes, it was just the winners of the county.

Enix

Yes, just so many from each county could attend and stay in the
dormitory. Of course, anybody that wanted to could go to the fair.

8

Sherman

Okay, so what years did you go to the state fair?

Enix

Oh, this would’ve been probably from 1950 to ’55, during those years.

Sherman

Did they have horse racing at the fair or stable racing? What kind of
entertainment did they have there?

Enix

If they had horse racing, I didn’t go to it because during the day we had
events that we were expected to attend. They were learning experiences,
judging contests, and if we got any free time, we were on the midway.
(Laughs)

Sherman

So you came in the fall of ’57 to OSU?

Enix

Fifty-six.

Sherman

You had your prior experiences with Roundup. Did you have any
different sort of reaction coming up here, or were you familiar with
campus because you attended Roundup?

Enix

I was somewhat familiar with campus, and I had met another girl at
Roundup who was going to take home economics education, the same as
I was, who was from a small town. We decided to room together and
help each other find our way around campus the first year. We enrolled
in the same classes.

Sherman

And who would that be?

Enix

That was Judy Ford, now Schafer, and she’s now living in Bryan, Texas.

Sherman

Will you see her this weekend?

Enix

No, as far as I know she’s not coming back.

Sherman

What was the dorm that you were assigned to?

Enix

I stayed on the third floor of Willard dorm for the three years that I
stayed in a dormitory, but that was during the winter, and then during the
summer, I did stay in Stout. I did go to summer school, and Stout was a
new one with air conditioning. (Laughter)

Sherman

That was probably a Godsend for you.

Enix

Yes.

Sherman

What things do you remember about Willard Hall?

9

Enix

I worked in the cafeteria of Willard Hall, and this was the first year
Willard went from the dining room to the cafeteria-style meals, where
instead of just punching your meal card, we had vouchers. You picked
up what foods you wanted, and then the cashier figured the amount and
tore the vouchers out for that amount. We could also use those at the
Student Union as well as in the dorm, so it gave us a little bit of freedom.

Sherman

Because you worked in the cafeteria, were you able to get meals for
free?

Enix

No, I had the voucher just like everybody else, and we had to pay for our
meals just like everyone else.
Would you work breakfast, lunch?

Sherman
Enix

I worked all three meals. Not all three every day, but you got a schedule
every week, and maybe every semester it would change depending on
what hours you had classes. But I did work all three, worked in the
salad/dessert area for a while. Worked in washing dishes. Eventually
worked up to be a cashier, which paid the whole sum of seventy-five
cents an hour. The other jobs were fifty cents an hour, and one semester
I actually cooked on the grill, which paid a dollar an hour. Looking back,
that’s the first time I can remember discrimination on a job.
Why is that?

Sherman
Enix

Because the one that had been doing it before me was a fellow. He was
paid a dollar fifty an hour simply because he was a man, and I was only
paid a dollar an hour to do the same work. Things have changed in the
last few years.
Yes, definitely. Could you describe the phone situation?

Sherman
Enix

The phone was down the hall. We did not have phones in our room.
Never heard of a cell phone. When the phone rang, whoever was closest
would answer the phone and then holler the name down the hall of who
was wanted on the phone. This was our method. We did not call home
very often. I know in my situation, you only called home in an
emergency because you had to call collect. I can only remember calling
my parents two times during the time I was here in school. I’m not sure
they were emergencies, but… (Laughs)
You felt like they were emergencies.

Sherman
Well, I had called my folks when they had told me that I had won the

10

Enix

trip to Chicago, and then I also called them when I got engaged.
Wow. What kind of social functions did the residence hall have?

Sherman
Enix

They had get-togethers in the basement, just kind of social. It seems like
I remember a style review one time. Since we were all girls in the dorms,
the parlors and some of those get-togethers in the basement were the
only places fellows could come to. In fact, if one showed up on the
upper floors, it was hollered up and down the halls that there was a man
on floor.
Did you get along with your floormates?

Sherman
Enix

Yes, yes. I don’t remember a lot of their names, but yes, we got along
real well.
Did Willard host any international students?

Sherman
Enix

I am not aware if they did. It may have been I just wasn’t tuned into it at
that time.
Did you have the same room all three years?

Sherman
Enix

Yes, I did because if you had a room, you had first choice on it again the
next year. You could move if you didn’t like your room.
Where was it located?

Sherman
It was 318.
Enix
Have you seen Willard Hall since it’s been renovated?
Sherman
Yes, I have been to one meeting over there.
Enix
What did you think about the renovations over there?
Sherman
Enix

Well, it makes good use of the building. I was, I believe, in the basement
for one of the programs and haven’t been on the upstairs floor, but as
time goes by, students aren’t wanting a small dormitory room with two
people in a room and the bathroom down the hall, so it was a good way
to make use of that building, and it is a great location.
You weren’t in a sorority, were you?

Sherman
No, I wasn’t.
Enix

11

Was there a reason you chose not to?
Sherman
Enix

Probably cost, and I’m not one that likes a lot of socials. You know, they
had a lot of dances and all, so that really wasn’t my thing.
What did you do for your free time? How did you entertain yourself?

Sherman
Enix

I spent quite a bit of time at the BSU, which was the Baptist Student
Center [Union], for the first two years. Then, after that, I had met my
present husband, and we started going to Wesley Foundation. I also was
active in collegiate 4-H and the Home Ec Club. It was a big outing to
walk down to Campus Corner and have a cup of coffee and maybe go to
the movies at the old [Leachman] Theater that was on that corner.
How did collegiate 4-H differ from your hometown 4-H?

Sherman
Enix

Sherman
Enix

Collegiate 4-H was more of a social group here on campus of former 4Hers from all over the state that were students here. It kind of kept us in
touch with the program, and we usually helped with Roundup in the
spring.
Was it primarily home ec kids, ag students, or was there a whole bunch
of different majors in it?
They were from all different areas. I would say probably the majority
were agricultural or home ec students just based on their background of
coming from the farms.
How many credit hours did you take per semester?

Sherman
Enix

I tried to take about fifteen a semester. I needed the extra time for
working as much as I could.
Do you remember your dorm mom?

Sherman
Enix

I was trying to remember that, and I did come up with it. Ms. White was
the dorm mom at that time. I haven’t come up with a mental picture of
what she looked like, but I know she was very good with us girls.
Did you have any interaction with the dean of women?

Sherman
No.
Enix
Did you ever have any interaction with the president?
Sherman
I can’t remember having interaction with him. I know it was President

12

Enix

[Oliver] Willham at the time.
Do you remember how students viewed him?

Sherman
He was a well-liked president, well-liked by the students.
Enix
Did you go into any athletic events?
Sherman
Enix

Sherman

Enix

I attended a few, but I was not a large sports fan. At that time, we did
have athletic tickets that would get us into any of them. We paid a fee
when we paid our tuition, a student fee of some type that let us with our
ID into any of the football games, basketball games, this type of thing,
so I did go to some of those, but working in the cafeteria, sometimes I’d
have to go late, sometimes have to leave early in order to get back there.
What campus spots do you remember the most? What sticks out in your
memory that you have fond memories about, campus spots, campus
locations?
I remember Theta Pond being a real pretty area to walk around, and, of
course, Willard Hall was facing Theta, so it was one that was easily
watched and a beautiful view out your window. Then, the Bennett
Memorial Chapel was another beautiful spot on campus.
Was that where the Wesley Foundation met?

Sherman
No, Wesley Foundation met across the street from the campus.
Enix
In their present location?
Sherman
In their present location, yes.
Enix
Was that the same building?
Sherman
Enix

I believe it was the same building. It’s just been renovated, maybe added
on to, but it was a fairly new building at that time.
How involved were you in the Wesley Foundation?

Sherman
Enix

Well, I wasn’t really that involved with Wesley since I had come up as a
Baptist to the Baptist Student Union. I only went to the Wesley
Foundation after I started dating Jim. I was active in the BSU for one
semester. I was the editor of their paper that they put out.
Did the BSU have social activities?

Sherman

13

Enix

We had social activities. We had space where you could come study if
you wanted to, devotionals, just a good place to hang out with friends.
Where was that located?

Sherman
Enix

It was in the present location where it is now across the street from the
university.
Do you remember what buildings you had class in?

Sherman
Enix

Sherman
Enix

Well, there was the Classroom Building. We had quite a few there, and
the new home ec building was where a lot of the home economics
classes were. Then, the food classes were in the old home economics
building. Those were the main three that I had classes in.
Do you remember any professors that stood out, that assisted you
greatly?
(Laughs) Well, there was a Ms. Gould that was our tailoring teacher. I
do remember her, and Mrs. Gerber was the chemistry teacher for home
economics chemistry, which was a required class. I definitely remember
her because it was said if you had not had high school chemistry, you
could not pass her class. Of course, I learned this after I was enrolled in
the class, and I had not had high school chemistry. Then also, was told
when I wanted to miss class to go to Chicago that there was no way I
could pass that class, but I did.
You did?

Sherman
Enix

I did, yes. Of course, Dean Lela O’Toole was dean of home economics
at the time, and there were—oh gosh, I’m kind of blank on some of the
others, not being real good with coming up with names. I can remember
some of the classes, but that’s about as far as it goes on professors.
What was your hardest class?

Sherman
Probably that chemistry class. (Laughs)
Enix
Probably that chemistry?
Sherman
Enix

The other hard ones for me were the PE classes that were required at the
time. You had to have three semesters of physical education, and one of
them had to be swimming. So I struggled through those three classes, not
being very sports-minded, and I had trouble with my eyes following the
balls when we played tennis or golf, that type of program.

14

I didn’t know you had to have three semesters’ worth.
Sherman
Back then. I don’t think you do now.
Enix
I don’t believe so, either. What classes did you enjoy the most?
Sherman
Enix

Probably my sewing classes because I had been sewing since I was nine,
so they came fairly easy for me.
Do you still sew?

Sherman
Enix

Sherman
Enix

Some, yes. Not as much as I used to. There was a time in earlier years
when I even tailored my husband’s suits, but it has gotten to where you
can buy clothes readymade cheaper than you can buy the fabric, and
finding good fabric now is not easy to do.
Speaking of sewing, was that one of your hobbies that you did while you
were here, or did you have other hobbies?
I really didn’t have too many hobbies when I was in school. Since
leaving school, I have developed quite a few hobbies. Well, maybe one
hobby while I was in school was my cake decorating. Then I’ve gone on
—after my children were grown, I got into weaving and then some
basket making, beading. Now I’m into the embroidery machine, so, there
again, just like in 4-H, I can’t settle down on one thing. (Laughter)
But you spent your free time, you went to go see movies and…

Sherman
Went to see some movies, yes.
Enix
Did you go see any of the big bands that came through?
Sherman
Enix

I’m tone deaf, so no. I did not go to any see music program if I could get
out of it. (Laughter)
Were there any bridge games or…

Sherman
Enix

Never played bridge. Canasta was one that my family played a lot, but
you didn’t have too many students playing that here.
Did you hang out at the Student Union?

Sherman
Very little.
Enix
Very little?
Sherman

15

Enix

Yes. By the time I worked—and I did have to study to make my grades.
I spent quite a bit of time at the library because I found that there were
certain areas of the library where it was very quiet, and you could study
without being interrupted, whereas in your dorm rooms with a roommate
and people up and down the hall all the time, sometimes it was hard to
get a quiet space you could concentrate on your studies.
So tell me about the library from that time period.

Sherman
Enix

It was the library that’s there now. It was a fairly new library. To me, it
seemed like a very large building with lots of books, and almost a maze
if you had to go in and find a certain book. It took me awhile to learn
their catalog system and how to find the books I wanted once I found the
numbers and information of where they were. And, of course, I think it
was in my third year that we finally had a library class that explained
how the books were cataloged into a library.
And that was a one-hour class or what?

Sherman
Enix

I believe it was a one-hour class. It was not a real large class, but it
explained the Dewey Decimal System and how they went about putting
in all the books. I don’t remember a lot about it, but I know it did help in
using libraries.
Where were your quiet spots?

Sherman
Enix

Well, the library was the main one. Sometimes the BSU. You could find
a quiet corner there. They had certain areas that were to be quiet for
students to study, and other areas where you didn’t have to be quiet.
What were your curfew hours? Do you remember those?

Sherman
Enix

I was thinking about that the other day. I can’t remember if it was nine
or ten o’clock during the week, and then it was like midnight on Friday
and Saturday night. And the lights outside the dorm would blink ten
minutes before the doors locked, but even if you were at the library
studying, you had to watch the time.
Was there a difference between men’s hours and women’s hours?

Sherman
Enix

I don’t believe the men had curfew hours. It was only the women’s
dorms that had the curfew hours.
Did you feel that this was an issue, the difference between the hours?

Sherman
At the time, I didn’t give it any thought about being an issue. It made

16

Enix

sure that you got there so you could get your sleep, and it sometimes
gave you an excuse to come in without having to make an issue of
needing to get in.
What about dating? What was dating like back then compared to now?

Sherman
Enix

Well, I didn’t do too much dating up until my junior year when I started
dating Jim. A big date for us was Wesley Foundation, a walk to Campus
Corner for that endless cup of five-cent coffee, and occasionally a
movie. At Wesley Foundation, we did play a lot of games of ping pong.
Both of us were on very limited budgets, and so we didn’t have a lot of
money to spend on going out to eat or a lot of movies like some of the
youngsters seem to now, and even then some of them had more
discretionary money, but we were both on very tight budgets.
How did you meet Jim?

Sherman
Enix

My roommate and some of my friends went to Wesley Foundation, and I
stayed over between the regular semester and the summer school term to
work in the cafeteria during 4-H Roundup. Jim was a Stillwater boy, and
he had a car. The other girls knew him, and he would take us, and we
ended up over at Wesley Foundation quite a bit. Then, after school
started back the next fall, we started dating.
This would have been your junior year that you started dating?

Sherman
Yes.
Enix
What were summers like here in Stillwater?
Sherman
Enix

Summers in school were much more relaxed than the winter. You had
fewer subjects, but it was a more concentrated time in the class. Seems
like even the classes themselves were a more relaxed atmosphere, and, in
a way, I enjoyed it more than I did the winter term. They were smaller.
There were less students on campus, and so it was a fun time.
Did you ever go out to the lake at all during that time?

Sherman
No.
Enix
So summer sessions started when and ended when?
Sherman
Enix

There was usually, I believe, two weeks between when the regular
session ended and the summer session started, so it would have been
mid-June, and we went for nine weeks. Usually, I would spend one week
here working and then go home for a week before classes started.

17

Did your parents have a problem with you taking summer courses?
Sherman
My parents encouraged me.
Enix
Encouraged you?
Sherman
Enix

Yes. They said if I came back to the farm, there really were no jobs. It
was such a small community, and I lived out in the country with no
transportation to get to a job if there had been any available. I didn’t
have a car. And on campus, you know, we walked every place. Even if I
needed something from downtown, I had to find time to walk downtown
from campus.
Where did you live during the summertime? Did you live in Willard?

Sherman
Enix

I lived in Stout Hall. Willard was not used during the summer because
Stout was a new dormitory and it had air conditioning, so we were all
moved to Stout.
Did each room have a window unit?

Sherman
No.
Enix
It was central?
Sherman
It was kind of central, yes.
Enix
I’m sure that was a blessing. (Laughs)
Sherman
Yes. (Laughs)
Enix
Sherman
Enix

Sherman
Enix

Did you meet many people then in Stout Hall, or was there a different
group of people that you hung out with?
A few of the same ones that I had known from Willard were going to
summer school, so even though you would meet a few new ones, at this
point, I don’t remember any of the ones I met just during the summer.
Because we’re here for Homecoming, what do you remember about
Homecoming?
I remember they had parades. We didn’t have the big house decorations
that we have now. We had some hall decorations, competitions between
the students in the dorm, decorating our doors, maybe decorating
downstairs. There was a big parade downtown, and so usually go to the

18

parades.
Were there any walkout days that you remember?
Sherman
Enix

I can’t recall. It seems there was at least one walkout day when we won
some big sports event, but I don’t remember what it was.

Sherman

What about other traditions like religious emphasis week? Do you
remember that?
I don’t remember that.

Enix
What about Howdy Week?
Sherman
The what?
Enix
Howdy Week, freshman orientation?
Sherman
I never participated in that, so I don’t remember anything about it.
Enix
Did you wear a beanie?
Sherman
No, I don’t recall a beanie. (Laughs)
Enix
Now, were you engaged with your husband here?
Sherman
Yes.
Enix
Did he get tossed into Theta Pond?
Sherman
Enix

I don’t think he did. We were engaged and then married the summer of
’59 because he was going to put in his Army time, and then I graduated
in January of ’60.
So he served in…

Sherman
Enix

Sherman

He was in the Army at Fort Lee, Virginia. He left in October after school
had started. Some of the big events while I was in school was changing
from Oklahoma A&M to Oklahoma State. That happened after my first
year. Then in ’57, you know, we had the Oklahoma Semi-Centennial,
and I can remember there were a lot of things going on for that, a few on
campus. But that was a biggy at that time.
What do you remember about the name change? Did you have an
opinion about it?

19

Enix

At the time, you kind of grew attached to Oklahoma A&M, but as time
went on, it was—well, we were moving from a college to a university.
Yes. So not many people had cars on campus at that time?

Sherman
Enix

Not very many at all. There were some that did. There were two or three
from my hometown that did, so I was able to get rides back and forth
when I needed to go home.
How often would that be?

Sherman
Enix

Of course, you had your Thanksgiving, Christmas, between semesters in
the winter and then maybe two other times during the year.
Would you go home for Easter?

Sherman
Enix

Yes, we usually went home for Easter because that was my high school
alumni get-together, too. (Laughter) So I’d go home for Easter, but we
didn’t have as long out for Easter as we do now.
Was your Spring Break in March or around Easter time?

Sherman
Enix

We didn’t have what was called Spring Break. You had a little time at
Easter and the same thing in fall. We didn’t have fall break; we had time
at Thanksgiving.

Sherman

And you would get, what, the two days prior to Thanksgiving or the
whole week?

Enix

We didn’t get a whole week. As I recall, we might have had, like, that
Thursday and Friday and then the weekend.
I’m just curious. What kind of car did Jim drive?

Sherman
Enix

At the time, he was driving a 1950 Chevrolet and drove it until 1960
when we were able to get a new car.
What are some of your favorite memories about OSU?

Sherman
Enix

Oh boy. (Laughs) I had good experiences in the dormitory with the girls
that were there. We would have get-togethers in our rooms at different
times. We’d say, “Okay, we’re all going to get together in so-and-so’s
room,” and we’d go down and have an evening of just chatting. Maybe
somebody brought some cookies from home. We weren’t allowed to
cook in our rooms at that time. We couldn’t even have popcorn poppers
or electric skillets, but we’d get together in the room and just have a lot

20

of fun, maybe even late at night in our pajamas. Of course, I enjoyed
going to BSU and Wesley Foundation and participating in the events
there. The collegiate 4-H, I enjoyed going to their meetings because a lot
of those youngsters, even though they were from all over the state, I had
met them earlier at 4-H Roundup. Ira Hollar was the state 4-H leader.
The thing I remember about him was if he had met you as a 4-H
youngster, he could call your name anytime he met you on campus.
Wow. Good memory there.
Sherman
Yes, it was.
Enix
Do you still keep in touch with the friends that you made?
Sherman
Enix

I keep in touch with two of the girls that I lived in the home management
house with and also my former roommate and the girl that I did my
student teaching with. We all correspond at Christmastime and maybe in
between.
Could you share some experiences with the home management house?

Sherman
Enix

I was in the new home management house, which was on north Monroe.
Ms. McAllister was the lady that was in charge of the home management
house, and her reputation was that she did not give As. So the six of us
girls got together in advance and said, “Okay, so we’re not going to get
an A. Let’s have fun.” Evidently that worked because she said that we
would get up and find things in the cabinets that had not been used for
semesters and used them with some of our meals. Different ones of us
were assigned a week at a time to plan meals, and we were given a lowcost, a medium-cost or a high-cost budget to work on to plan the meals
for the week. Then we would plan our meals, meet with Ms. McAllister,
and she would make suggestions or tell us things. The thing I remember
is one of the girls said to her one time, “Ms. McAllister, you told me
this, and you told so-and-so something different.” She says, “Aha! You
are communicating.” She said, “I did that on purpose.” (Laughter) That
was one thing I remember, and she said because we did work together as
a good group.
Home management, was that the last…

Sherman
Enix

That was the last semester. In home economics, we called it, you were
“on the block.” You spent about two weeks in the classroom preparing
you for student teaching, then you were out in the field, student teaching.
I was at Glencoe for six weeks, and then you came back and had a
couple more weeks in the classroom reviewing what you learned there
and preparing you to go into the home management house. Then, we

21

moved into the home management house and actually lived there for six
weeks. We also had classes while we were there for that six weeks that
were more career orientated, how you interview, how you dress when
you go out on the job, and this, besides keeping up the house, doing the
meals, the cleaning, everything. And then when we moved out of there,
we had two more weeks in the classroom.
So it was good prep.
Sherman
Yes, it was.

Could you run a snapshot of where your life projected since you left
OSU?
Of course, I was married before I graduated, so as soon as I was out of
class, I went to Virginia and met Jim there. We lived outside of Fort Lee,
Virginia, in Hopewell until he was given a medical discharge because he
did wear a back brace, and he broke the back brace, and they couldn’t
figure out how he got in. We came back, and he started to work as the
assistant manager in Red Rock, Oklahoma. We had our first child,
Kathryn, while we lived there, and then moved from there to Tonkawa,
Oklahoma, and our son Byron was born there. Then, in ’62 we moved to
Wichita, Kansas, and he [Jim] worked with Farm Credit. I was a
homemaker and volunteer, and we lived there for twenty-eight years.
There was a merger, and we were transferred to Denver, Colorado, for
two and a half years, and at that time Jim retired. We bought the home
place and then moved back to Stillwater.
How in that time did Stillwater change?

Sherman
Enix

It grew tremendously. We’re living on forty acres, which was way out in
the country at the time it was bought in the 1940s by his family, and now
it is inside the city limits. Across the road from us are six hundred
apartments, and we back up to the airport. So we’re seeing more small
jets. At that time, it was all just small airplanes, and now there are some
smaller jets that we do see coming into the airport.
How has the university changed since you were here?

Sherman
Oh, has it ever grown. (Laughter)
Enix
Just like the town.
Sherman
Enix

Just like the town. It’s almost like you have to re-orientate yourself to
the campus, where the buildings are, just like starting over.

22

What do you think about all those changes?
Sherman
Enix

If you don’t change, you’re going to go backwards. I think it’s good. If
you don’t keep changing and growing, you’re going to be in trouble
down the line.
How has OSU impacted your life?

Sherman
Enix

Well, I think without OSU as a background, and as a small-town student,
I probably would’ve ended up on the farm and not have seen the world
with as big of eyes as I’ve had, just because of coming up here.
Is there anything that you’re looking forward to about this weekend?

Sherman
Enix

This morning was a big morning for the home economics, or human
environmental science, fifty-year graduates. We had a get-together this
morning, followed by pictures with Pistol Pete, and then lunch at
Taylor’s Dining Room and a program, and then this, and if we’re not too
tired, we will probably do the reception and Walkaround tonight and
then the parade in the morning.
What did you think of Taylor’s?

Sherman
Enix

It is a lovely dining room. They have really added to the HES buildings
and their equipment.

Sherman

Is there anything that you’d like to add before we go here that we
haven’t covered?

Enix

Gosh, we’ve covered a lot of ground. (Laughter) And things have really
changed in the last fifty years because I can remember as a youngster, no
running water and no electricity at home, and here we are with our fast
internet and cell phones and the way the world changes, but I think
college work, as they told us, all college does is teaches you to learn.
You have to keep learning or you’re going to be left behind.
Would you consider yourself a lifelong learner then?

Sherman
Enix

Yes, we are very active with the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute
(OLLI) here in Stillwater.
What do you think about that program?

Sherman
Enix

I think it’s the tops! We know we’re going to send our membership in
every year even before we see what program is being offered, and we try
to take as many as we can. You know, you can only take one on Tuesday

23

morning and one of them on Tuesday afternoon, one on Thursday
morning and one on Thursday afternoon, and then some of the computer
programs. So we’re taking in as many of those as we can and have not
had one yet that we did not think was excellent.
Sherman

That’s great. Well, I thank you for your time today, and I appreciate the
opportunity to interview you. I wish you the best and hope you continue
to have a fun and great weekend here.
Okay, thank you.
