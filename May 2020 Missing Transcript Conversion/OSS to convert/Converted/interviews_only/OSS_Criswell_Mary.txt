Criswell
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Karen Neurohr
March 4, 2012
Stillwater, Oklahoma
Neurohr

Today is March 4, 2012. My name is Karen Neurohr. I’m a librarian at
Oklahoma State University Library, and I’m here in the home of Mrs.
Mary Elizabeth Criswell, whose maiden name was Brown. I’m here
today to interview her about her experience as a student at Oklahoma
State University and then also find out a little bit about her childhood.
Thank you for letting me come interview you today. Mrs. Criswell, I
understand that you grew up in Claremore.

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

And tell me a little bit about your father.

Criswell

Well, my father was county judge of Rogers County, and my mother was
a homemaker. I have one sister, but she has died. Now, what do you
want to know?

Neurohr

Well, you told me at the program the other night that when you were a
little girl you met someone famous, and that was Will Rogers.

Criswell

Yes, yes.

Neurohr

So, tell me about that.

Criswell

I was a little girl and my father asked me one day, he was at the
courthouse, of course, and a buddy came home and said, “Would you
like to meet Will Rogers?” And I said, “Oh, yes! Oh, yes!” So, I did. He
took me there to the courthouse and also, a big bouquet of prize peonies

4

that my father raised. And he was very gracious, accepted the flowers
and thanked me, and I just felt so good. (Laughs)
Neurohr

About how old were you when that happened?

Criswell

I wasn’t school age, yet. So, I must have been about five.

Neurohr

About five years old. Were there a lot of people around?

Criswell

No, no, there weren’t very many people in the courthouse that day. And
they didn’t put me in jail. (Laughs)

Neurohr

Well, that’s good. Well, so, what does Will Rogers mean to you?

Criswell

Well, I have admired him from being a little girl and shaking his hand.
And he has been someone to look up to, and I was glad to meet him, and
I’m glad that I’m still here. (Laughs)

Neurohr

Did you see some of the movies he was in when you were young?

Criswell

Oh, yes! Oh, yes! I did, but I can’t tell you now what they were.

Neurohr

What was it like to go to the movie theater? Did you go to the movies on
Saturdays when you were growing up?

Criswell

Oh, yes, yes. Yes, you could go to the matinee Saturday and it was
cheaper in those days. I went quite often to the movies.

Neurohr

Is there anything else that you would like to tell me about Will Rogers?

Criswell

I’m reading the book and I wasn’t aware of some of the things, of
course, because I was still little. But he grew up in Oologah, of course,
and I was there many times. My father was the county judge, and he had
to be elected every few years. I would go with him when he campaigned,
and he was a very wonderful man. And my mother, sadly, died early, so
he raised my little sister by himself. She’s ten years younger, but she
isn’t alive now.

Neurohr

You said that you went to a lot of the campaigns for your father.

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

So, what was that like? Did you go to schools or churches?

Criswell

Well, we just got in the car, and he would stop at various places in the
country. He knew everybody. I think he knew everybody. And we used

5

to have—a long time ago, he came from Georgia, and they had what
they called the Georgia Picnic every year for the people in Claremore
who had come from Georgia. So, that was fun, and he took me on
several trips that were just wonderful. And my mother was not able to
go, so he took me and we saw a lot of the country. I had a wonderful
childhood.
Neurohr

How did you travel for those trips?

Criswell

In a car.

Neurohr

In a car?

Criswell

Yes, yes.

Neurohr

Does any one particular place stand out to you that you went with your
father?

Criswell

No, it was just everybody in the county. And generally, I’d stay in the
car while he went and talked to people, but sometimes I went along,
listened. I can still remember, in those days, I don’t know if it’s still true,
to get married, the county judge could do that and a number of people
would come to our house to be married. I would sit there enthralled.
(Laughs) And I don’t know, let me see, we went to—Honey, right now I
can’t tell you, but we went to a lot of different places in the United
States, not outside—well, we did go to Mexico. When my husband was
alive, we traveled a lot.

Neurohr

Did your father have an education?

Criswell

He was, a long time ago, and he took—what do you call it when you
don’t go to school but you take…

Neurohr

Some training course?

Criswell

Yes, and he did get his certificate to teach school, which he did for a
little while, while he was a young man and before he moved to
Claremore. So, my parents were very dear, and I had one sister and no
other children. I had kinfolks, though, that lived in Claremore, and so I
had a lot of people to go see.

Neurohr

Well, I guess let’s talk about when you came to Stillwater. What was it
that made you decide to come to Oklahoma A&M College?

Criswell

Well, when I started to college, not very many people had a college
education. So, I think I was the first one or maybe just the second of my

6

family who went to college. And my dearest, dearest friend was going to
go to Oklahoma A&M, and so my dad said, “You’re going to go, too,”
and he made—in fact, he borrowed money to send me. But then I got a
job in not too long, and so I helped with the expenses. I worked for the
dean of—his name was Dr. McIntosh, and he was the Dean of…
Neurohr

Was it education?

Criswell

No, it wasn’t education. It was—Honey, I cannot even… [Dean of the
Graduate College]

Neurohr

That’s okay. Well, when you came to Oklahoma A&M College, did you
ride the train to get here or did your father bring you?

Criswell

Well, yes, but they didn’t come very often. It wasn’t far to Claremore,
but in those days, we didn’t just go all the time. And can you imagine?
(Laughs) All of us girls wore high heels to class and every place we
went. (Laughs) Well, we had a wonderful time. My two best friends
came at the same time I did.

Neurohr

Where did you live when you were in college?

Criswell

In the dormitory.

Neurohr

Do you remember the name of it? Was it Willard?

Criswell

No, no, it was… Oh, I can’t say.

Neurohr

One of the other ones? Thatcher?

Criswell

No, Gardiner Hall.

Neurohr

Gardiner Hall. Was one of your friends your roommate?

Criswell

Oh, yes. In the dormitory, we got kind of a suite so that all three of us
could stay in the same place. We had a good time.

Neurohr

Do you remember Dean Stout, the Dean of Women? Ms. Julia Stout?

Criswell

Laura? No, no, that was the house mother.

Neurohr

Oh, you had a house mother?

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

Oh, tell me about that.

7

Criswell

Well, she was pretty stern, and we had to be in at a certain time. But she
was real sweet to me, so we had a… And while I was still in the
dormitory, I met my husband.

Neurohr

Oh, tell me about that.

Criswell

Well, Louise and Dorothy and I went to church, and we walked
everywhere because we didn’t have cars, then. Not anybody—well,
maybe some of the faculty, but not very many of the students had. And
now, where was I?

Neurohr

When you met your husband.

Criswell

Oh, yes. Well, one day Louise and Dorothy and I were walking to
church because we walked everywhere. We went by a certain place near
the campus, and I looked over and there were some boys playing…

Neurohr

Basketball?

Criswell

Yes. And one of them I knew because he was in a class with me, and so
he said, “Hello,” and I said, “Hello.” And that afternoon, I got a
telephone call, and he told me what his name was, and he said, “What do
you plan to do tonight?” And I said, “Well, my roommates and I are
going to church.” And he said, “Well, would you let me go to church
with you?” And that was the start of our whole life.

Neurohr

What church did you go to?

Criswell

First Christian Church. Still do. (Laughs)

Neurohr

So, what did you major in when you were in school?

Criswell

Education and a minor in English.

Neurohr

Did you always want to be a teacher?

Criswell

Well, I guess I won’t say I really wanted badly to be a teacher, but in
those days when you didn’t have very much money, you could go for a
semester and then you could teach a little while and then go back to
school and then teach a little while. So, that’s what I decided to do.
Being a teacher was one thing that I really thought I would like to do.
But I took a lot of… I took a lot of… I can’t say it, Honey. I’m sorry.

Neurohr

That’s okay. So, did you teach some, then?

8

Criswell

No.

Neurohr

Oh, you never did?

Criswell

No.

Neurohr

So, you met your husband while you were in college.

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

When did you get married?

Criswell

When I graduated. (Laughs)

Neurohr

Was he already out of school?

Criswell

Yes, he was already, and we had a wonderful life, Darling.

Neurohr

Was your wedding in Stillwater?

Criswell

No, he came from Chickasha.

Neurohr

Oh, he was from Chickasha. Did you get married in Stillwater or
Claremore?

Criswell

At Claremore. In fact, we decided that we would just go and took off
work. He worked, too, and I worked in the graduate school. We took off
one afternoon on a Friday and drove to Claremore. And let me see,
September in the Rain was one of the new songs at the time, and that
came on the radio and the rain came down at the same time, and it just
seemed perfect, and that’s what we… When I got there, my dearest
friend’s mother called and she said, “I have everything fixed for you.
Don’t go anywhere else.” She said, “Just come to my house.” She had
everything fixed so beautifully, flowers and everything to eat. She was
like a second mother to me. My mother was ill so much, and so Louise’s
mother was my second mother and she had everything fixed for us. It
was so wonderful. I didn’t expect it. I have been so blessed with friends
and family. I just can’t tell you how wonderful it has been.

Neurohr

When you were working at the college for the dean, what kind of work
were you doing?

Criswell

Secretarial.

Neurohr

Was it a very busy job?

9

Criswell

Well, yes, it was busy because there were two other—besides the dean
of the graduate school who I really worked for, there were two other
men. They were professors, and they also brought me work to do. So, I
did very well, I think.

Neurohr

Did you continue working there after you graduated?

Criswell

No.

Neurohr

Were you involved in some…

Criswell

Well, I did work a little while after I graduated.

Neurohr

I think I saw in the yearbook that your senior year was 1936. Was your
senior year 1936? Was that the year that you got married and you
graduated?

Criswell

Not my senior year, no. I can’t tell you, now.

Neurohr

Were you in Kappa Delta Pi?

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

What was that like?

Criswell

Well, it was a surprise to me, but I was glad. We just had meetings. That
was nothing exciting.

Neurohr

Why was it a surprise to you?

Criswell

Well, because I didn’t expect to get a job that easy.

Neurohr

What other memories do you have of being a student at Oklahoma A&M
College? You went to church a lot. What other things did you do?

Criswell

Well, goodness. (Laughs) Honey, I can’t tell you right now.

Neurohr

Do you remember any of your professors in particular?

Criswell

Dr. McIntosh, Mr. Orr.

Neurohr

What do you remember about Dr. McIntosh?

Criswell

Oh, he was a wonderful man, very kind to me. And if I hesitated when I
took dictation, he would stop and wait for me. He was a wonderful man.
And his wife was… I was scared to death of her. (Laughs)

10

Neurohr

Did she work at the college?

Criswell

No, but she was pretty stern. (Laughs) However, she was nice to me and
had me to come have dinner several times and kind of took me under her
wing.

Neurohr

After you and Mr. Criswell were married and you made your home in
Stillwater then, and…?

Criswell

Yes, and he was in Stillwater National Bank. He was the vice president.

Neurohr

Did your husband go to the war after you were married?

Criswell

He didn’t get in the war itself, but he was called up because he was
ROTC, and he was sent to Bermuda. There was a lot of possibility for
him to have been in danger, but they never did come there. And he felt
that he hadn’t done his part, but he was three years away from me, and I
had a little girl. I got a letter every day, and I wrote a letter every day for
three years.

Neurohr

Do you still have your letters?

Criswell

No. One night, we were sitting by our fireplace. It wasn’t this house. But
we were sitting by the fireplace. I had saved every one, and he had saved
every one, but this was when the war was over and he was home. He
said, “Let’s burn all of these in the fireplace.” I said, “Why?” and he
said, “Because it’s just between you and me.” And we did. I’m sorry that
I haven’t got them now.

Neurohr

I understand that you like poetry a lot.

Criswell

Oh, yes. I’ve written some, too.

Neurohr

You have?

Criswell

Yes. I love poetry.

Neurohr

Tell me about that.

Criswell

Well, there’s nothing to tell except that I just always, always, from the
time I started school, I’ve memorized all the poetry in the books, and I
still love it. I have written some myself.

Neurohr

Did you collect poems that you like?

11

Criswell

Oh, yes, I have a book.

Neurohr

So, what is one of your favorite poems?

Criswell

Well, I’ve got it written down in that book, somewhere.

Neurohr

Do you still write poetry?

Criswell

Not anymore.

Neurohr

I understand that you were a charter member of a book club.

Criswell

Yes. In that time, you had to—it was a whole lot—everybody in all of
the things were together. Well, our group decided that we wanted to be
by ourselves, and we were the Potpourri Book Club. And oh, the friends
I had in that. It was wonderful. I still have a few living. Not many, but
anyway.

Neurohr

Did that book club start right after you were married?

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

So, what, ’36 or ’37? Do you remember what year that was?

Criswell

No, I don’t, but I still belong to a book club.

Neurohr

You do?

Criswell

Yes, Potpourri Book Club.

Neurohr

The Potpourri Book Club. How often did you meet?

Criswell

Once a month.

Neurohr

What were your meetings like? Can you describe them?

Criswell

Well, we just all got together and we visited awhile, and then somebody
did a book review. Then we discussed it, and the next time it was
someone else’s turn, and so it was fun.

Neurohr

Did you meet in each other’s homes?

Criswell

Yes, yes we did.

Neurohr

Did you have dessert or food? Did you have coffee or dessert or food?

12

Criswell

Oh, we had desserts. (Laughs)

Neurohr

You did?

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

And where were your children when you had your book club meetings?

Criswell

They were home.

Neurohr

They were home.

Criswell

Yes. But then, of course, they all graduated and I was still in a book
club. (Laughs) Everybody did a review of a book. And some book clubs
had somebody do it all the time, but we took turns.

Neurohr

Do you think that was better to have people take turns?

Criswell

Oh, yes. Everybody had something different. (Laughs) One, Lou Hillier,
even gave a book review on cooking, on a cookbook! (Laughter) And
everybody had different interests, and so it made it very interesting to
hear everybody. I’m still a member of a book club.

Neurohr

That’s wonderful. Did you go to the public library to get your books?

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

Tell me what you remember about the public library from those days.

Criswell

Well, the library was just second place for me because I loved to go to
the library, and I still do.

Neurohr

When you were going to school at Oklahoma A&M College, do you
remember the library from college?

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

What was it like?

Criswell

Well, I’m trying to think where it was. You know where—well, I can’t,
Honey. I’m sorry.

Neurohr

Did women wear pants when you were in college?

Criswell

No, oh, no! (Laughs) We wore high heels and dressed up. That’s why I
have bunions. (Laughter)

13

Neurohr

You said that your husband called—when you met him, he called you on
the telephone. Where was the telephone?

Criswell

There was one place where not anybody lived. There were rooms
everywhere, but then there was a big room where you could meet and
have company and so on.

Neurohr

Was the telephone in the big room?

Criswell

Oh, yes, the telephone was there. So, somebody would answer it, and
then they’d yell down the halls like, “Mary!” or, “Joan!” (Laughs) And
you’d come to the telephone. There was just one.

Neurohr

Your Potpourri Book Club, who were some of the members of the
Potpourri Book Club?

Criswell

Okay. Mary V. Rippy, you remember Dr. Rippy?

Neurohr

I didn’t live here then.

Criswell

Oh, okay. Well, Mary V. Rippy, Lou Hillier, Ethel Cudd. I should have
written all of this down, but I didn’t know what you were going to ask.

Neurohr

Oh, this is fine. I think you told me Thursday that you have written out
your memoirs.

Criswell

I’m doing it.

Neurohr

You’re doing that now?

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

Are you enjoying that? Do you enjoy writing?

Criswell

At one time, I thought that I would like to be a writer, so I have written a
lot. I’ve written poetry, and then I read everything I can get my hands
on.

Neurohr

When did your husband propose do you?

Criswell

When did he propose?

Neurohr

Yes.

Criswell

Well, it was very soon after I graduated. He was already—he had a car, a

14

real nice car, and we decided to go to see my dad. And on the way in the
car, he asked me. And of course, I said yes.
Neurohr

Did you think he was going to ask you to marry him?

Criswell

Oh, I thought so all the time. (Laughs)

Neurohr

You did? (Laughter)

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

Then when you went to see your father, was that when he talked to your
father about marrying you?

Criswell

Yes. My husband went, like I told you, was in the military, and so he
was gone three years, almost three years from home. That was a lonely
time.

Neurohr

Tell me what it was like when he came back.

Criswell

Oh, it was wonderful, Honey! (Laughs) I can’t explain it. It was so
wonderful because some people didn’t come back. But you can’t
imagine the letters that we both wrote. He was a wonderful. I’ve got
pictures of him.

Neurohr

Well, I think this was a picture that...

Criswell

Yes, yes. (Laughs) That was in college.

Neurohr

That was in college?

Criswell

Yes. We were both dressed up.

Neurohr

You were dressed up! Do you remember what you were dressed up for in
this picture?

Criswell

Why?

Neurohr

Yes, where were you going?

Criswell

Let me see. Oh, it was when I graduated. Yes, yes. Don’t you think he’s
handsome? (Laughs)

Neurohr

Yes, and you’re beautiful. That’s a very pretty dress. Did you sew your
own clothes?

15

Criswell

Oh, I sewed. I didn’t make that one, but I sewed almost all my clothes
and all my children’s clothes. I love to sew.

Neurohr

You do?

Criswell

Yes.

Neurohr

Who taught you to sew? Did you learn how to sew when you were in
school?

Criswell

Oh, no. I learned how when I was a little tiny girl. I can’t remember
when I didn’t sew.

Neurohr

Well, and I understand that you also paint.

Criswell

Yes. That’s one of mine. (Gestures) This is one of mine. (Gestures) All
of those up there are mine. (Gestures) And I’ve got a lot in the rest of the
house. I love to paint. It’s recreation to me. I love it. I haven’t done any
for a long time right now, but I’m going to do some more.

Neurohr

There’s some embroidery pictures on your wall behind the couch.

Criswell

Well, during the war when my husband was gone and I couldn’t sleep at
night, and I’d put my children to bed, I had to have something to do. So,
I did these two, the big ones then. And those down there are the Japanese
—I can’t think of the name now. A fabric company had a contest, and I
just entered the contest. I didn’t get first place, but I got honorable
mention.

Neurohr

Well, that’s wonderful.

Criswell

And I have pictures everywhere. I love to paint. Last few years I just do
watercolors because oils got to where they were too strong, the smell, so
I just did watercolors.

Neurohr

Did you ever meet President Bennett when you were in college?

Criswell

Yes, I met him, yes.

Neurohr

What do you remember about him?

Criswell

Well, he was just the president. I just knew him. That was all.

Neurohr

Did you have any favorite classes when you were in college?

Criswell

Oh, English, always. I took every English class I could.

16

Neurohr

Did you have a favorite professor of English?

Criswell

That’s hard to—I can see him, but I can’t tell you his name. He was a
very gaunt looking man, tall and thin, but I can’t think of his name right
now. But he was a very good teacher.

Neurohr

What did you like about the way that he taught? How was his teaching
style? What was good about his teaching?

Criswell

His teaching?

Neurohr

Yes. How was his teaching good?

Criswell

Well, I guess because I just liked the subject so much. (Laughs)

Neurohr

Did you ever hear about a poet from Oklahoma named Wilma Elizabeth
McDaniel?

Criswell
No, I don’t remember that name. Why?
Neurohr

Well, she left Oklahoma in 1936 and went to California, but she wrote a
lot of poems about Oklahoma. Is there anything else that you would like
to share for the interview today?

Criswell

Honey, I think you’ve asked me just about everything.

Neurohr

All right. Well, I thank you again and appreciate the time.

Criswell

Oh, I appreciate your coming, Honey, and come and just visit, sometime.
Well, thank you. I’ll enjoy doing that.

Neurohr
I know you’re busy.
Criswell
Neurohr

Well, maybe you can come to another one of the Will Rogers programs
that we have coming up.
Yes.

Criswell
Neurohr

Since we talked about the pictures, I think I will get those in the picture.
Now, this is a scrapbook here that Gaye got out. Do you want to tell me
a little bit about that?
These? (Gestures)

Criswell

17

Yes.
Neurohr
Criswell

This was my best friend, Louise. This was a poem I wrote. This was
another one I wrote. This was my husband. This is me, and this is
another friend in college and me. (Laughs) Oh, do you remember
Swim’s?
I’ve heard about it.

Neurohr
Criswell

Okay. This was Mr. Swim. He just took us under his wings, and that was
me and my cousin—my roommate. I can’t tell you who those were, too
little. And some of them have faded. Here I am and a whole lot of my
friends, and this is the same that that bigger picture is.
Would you like to read those poems?

Neurohr
Well, do you want me to?
Criswell
I think that would be wonderful.
Neurohr
This is In Class, On a Summer Afternoon.
Criswell
So dull are books, so flat are maps—
Important in their way, perhaps—
But prisoning to restive souls
On summer days.
When there are undulating hills
And sparkling streams where water spills
Into the cool blue pools
Incessantly.
When there are cotton clouds afloat
And waxen leaves to make a boat
To send upon the truant streams
Adventuring.
So much to see, so much to do—
So many by-paths to pursue
From end of earth to end of earth
Before I die.
That was that one. And this is Silhouettes.
Night slips quickly over the campus
Above Old Central silhouetted against

18

A sky of blue-green
Paling as it nears the horizon
Quivers the first crystalline star.
Ebon silhouette of trees against the silver sky
Lacy willows black against a moon that’s
Riding high
Liquid golden darts within the waters onyx deep
Zig-zagging glints
Shimmering tints
Like needlepoints that dance to meet the moon.
Those are nice.
Neurohr
Well…
Criswell
Did you write those when you were in college?
Neurohr
Yes.
Criswell
You did?
Neurohr
Criswell

Yes. Well, this book is full of lots of different memories. My
grandchildren and everybody. Honey, I don’t think I’ve done a very
good job.
Yes, I think it’s been a nice interview. I do. I appreciate that.

Neurohr
Criswell

But I have had so many interests, painting, and we even did painting
china for a long time. That’s not as much fun as a picture, but I’ve done
all kinds of artwork. I was in the Art Guild for a long time. I haven’t
gone, though, in a long time. It’s too much for me to do that. Anyway, I
have been so blessed, Honey, so blessed. I am so thankful for everything
that has happened to me. Even the bad things aren’t too bad.
What advice would you give to people today?

Neurohr
Criswell

To do what you want to do best and don’t forget the things that you love
and just keep on doing them, like whatever is your interest.
And it sounds like you’ve been able to do that with your life.

Neurohr
Criswell

Yes, I have, Honey. Oh, I’ve been so fortunate. I have a picture of—I
did a quilt one time. I did a lot of quilting several years ago, and I got a
Golden Thimble award from the newspaper in Tulsa—no, Oklahoma
City, and had pictures of part of what I had done. I love to sew and I
didn’t want patterns. I did my daughter’s wedding dress, and I love—I

19

can’t anymore. My hands don’t work that well, but I have had so many
interests and so many wonderful things happen, Honey. I hope that
you’re just as happy as I am.
Well thank you, thank you. Thank you again for the interview.
Neurohr
You’re welcome, Honey.
