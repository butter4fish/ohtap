Paul & Connie Brown
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Latasha Wilson
October 28, 2011
Stillwater, Oklahoma
Wilson

Today is October 28, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I’m with
the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library.
Today, I’m talking with Paul and Connie Brown about their memories of
OSU for the O-State Stories Project. Paul is celebrating his fiftieth
reunion this Homecoming weekend here in Stillwater. Thank you for
being with us today.

P. Brown

Thank you.

Wilson

What are some things you’re most excited about for your reunion this
weekend?

P. Brown

We come back to campus quite often for all the ballgames and other
kind of events. When we lived away in the Rockies, in the southeast, we
enjoyed coming back, kind of Homecoming, but now we come over
quite often. We do meet friends for the games that we also graduated
with. It’s getting together with friends within a few hundred miles and
seeing the campus grow. Then we come over often because both of our
kids, Kevin and Teresa, graduated here: Teresa in ’84 and Kevin in ’88.
Then we’ll also be coming over starting next year because our
granddaughter will also be going here, and hopefully our grandson. It’s
nice coming back. Stillwater was our first home, two blocks south of the
campus, after we got married between my senior year between the first
and second semester, so that’s kind of fun coming back to our first real
home, in an apartment.

Wilson

And you all live in Tulsa now?

C. Brown

Correct.

4

Wilson

So it is not too far away.

C. Brown

No.

P. Brown

No.

C. Brown

No, about an hour and fifteen minutes.

Wilson

So are there any events that are going on for your fiftieth reunion this
year that are extra special?

P. Brown

Yes, the alumni group has put together a golf cart tour of all the
decorations, and there’s also a reception this afternoon. Then tomorrow
(I’m a graduate of the Business School, fifty years) I get my fifty-year
pin, and they’ll also have a reception tomorrow. We’re also meeting
friends that we graduated with tomorrow, so it’s kind of special.

Wilson

Yes.

C. Brown

And we really appreciate the golf cart tour. Our old feet just can’t take it
these days. (Laughter)

Wilson

That sounds nice, and there is a lot to see. Lots of changes have taken
place on campus.

C. Brown

Yes. Hardly recognize the place.

P. Brown

We enjoy talking about, you know, the ’60s generation when we went
here, the different jobs we had on campus, the pay, and seeing friends,
so it’s really fun.

Wilson

Well, I’m excited to hear about that today. (Laughter) First of all, let’s
start out with having you tell me each where you were born and where
you grew up.

P. Brown

Okay.

C. Brown

I was born in Oklahoma City. It was called Wesley Hospital. It’s no
longer there. I was raised in Oklahoma City then my parents—we moved
quite a bit. We moved to small towns around Oklahoma. I never lived
anyplace else but Oklahoma, (Wewoka, Seminole, Oklahoma City) and I
enjoyed the fact of moving. That’s why I didn’t mind moving with our
jobs we had since we were transferred seventeen times. Well, that was
kind of fun. (Laughs)

5

P. Brown

I’m also from Oklahoma City. I was born in Oklahoma City. I lived
there basically until I finished at OSU. We both went to John Marshall
High School. After we graduated from OSU, as Connie said, then we
started moving to a number of locations with Conoco.

Wilson

What year did you graduate high school?

P. Brown

Nineteen fifty-seven. The year that it went from Oklahoma A&M
[College] to Oklahoma State [University], in 1957.

Wilson

Did you hear much about that? Were people still talking about it?

P. Brown

Oh, yes. That was a big subject for a couple of years. We were the first
class in 1957 that graduated as Oklahoma State for the full time.

Wilson

Were most people thinking positively about that change, or were people
still unsure?

P. Brown

No, very much so, very much so because with the classes and the
majors, it just encompassed more than agricultural and engineering. I
didn’t hear any bad comments whatsoever. They were all good. OSU did
a good job when they did convert the name, going back to a lot of the
A&M graduates, working with them, also.

C. Brown

A lot of people called it the cow college for a while, but they soon broke
that tune. (Laughter) My grandfather used to raise cows, and he was
good friends with the dean of agriculture then. That’s all I ever heard
him call it was the cow college. (Laughter)

Wilson

So you two meet in high school?

C. Brown

Yes.

Wilson

Do you remember how you met?

C. Brown

Yes.

P. Brown

We met in class, but we kind of laugh about it. We met near Sadie
Hawkins Day, so I was invited on the first date. I was kind of shy, so I
don’t know if I’d have ever asked her out. Of course, I was watching her
in class [since she was so pretty and fun].

C. Brown

He was very shy. He changed a lot. (Laughter) That’s what I liked about
him, because he was shy. (Laughs)

P. Brown

But we never went to the same school awhile when I was going up here

6

and she was at OU for a couple of years. When we did get married and
lived here, I converted her, pretty much. She’s a “Go Pokes!”-type gal
now. (Laughs)
C. Brown

This is a very friendly campus, very friendly campus.

Wilson

Well, how did you initially decide to come here?

P. Brown

Actually, I started at Phillips [University] at Enid and met a friend that
had gone to OU for one year. We decided to just transfer to Oklahoma
State basically because of my major and his major. We’re glad we did.

Wilson

Where did you live when you got up here?

P. Brown

I lived in an apartment, did not live in the dorm up here. We did have an
apartment. Then at mid-semester my senior year, we did marry, and we
found, actually, a new apartment just south of Theta Pond about two
blocks. We lived there until I graduated, then, in May of 1961.

Wilson

Is that the location you were saying is now Party Pics?

C. Brown

Is it still Party Pics? I thought it was gone now.

Wilson

Oh, I haven’t been there in a while. (Laughs)

C. Brown

I think so.

P. Brown

We’ve not taken the time to drive by, but we are today because it was
pretty new, the upstairs-downstairs duplex-type apartment.

C. Brown

Our daughter thought it was gone, too, but then she had Party Pics—I
mean, we had to let her Party Pics come in the house, took up so much
room. She had a good investment in that company.

Wilson

So did you room with this boy that came?

P. Brown

Yes, we did until we got married. At Phillips my first year, I did live in a
dorm. I just decided to live in an apartment. We were lucky what we
found each time.

Wilson

What did you do about food, living off campus?

P. Brown

We ate at the library an awful lot.

Wilson

Really? (Laughter)

7

P. Brown

Not the library. I’m sorry. The cafeteria. At the time, it was a little
different style. It was the old style cafeteria with two lines. A lot of times
breakfast, lunch, and dinner we ate, actually, in the cafeteria. We would
make The Strip sometimes. Of course, that was before a number of the
other locations here. We also ate at some of the rooming homes.
Rooming houses would have family-type meals. About once a week we
would go for a family-type meal. I think it was like a dollar and a quarter
for a big family-style dinner.

C. Brown

The cafeteria also had ice cream made with the dairy products from the
dairy school here. Oh, man, that was good! You couldn’t buy that ice
cream anywhere else. It was delicious.

Wilson

Wish they hadn’t quit that. (Laughter)

C. Brown

I think it was fifty cents for a great big dish. It was good.

Wilson

You mentioned you would go to The Strip on occasion. Do you
remember any specific places there?

P. Brown

No, it really hasn’t changed that much. Of course, at that time we could
not visit some of the beer locations because we were underage at the
time. It was primarily pizza and the quick-type food-type places. That’s
one reason we ate in the cafeteria in the Union so much.

Wilson

Did you have a job while you were here?

P. Brown

Yes, I had several jobs. One of them we were laughing about was at the
library for two years. It was interesting because at the time, the pay in
1959, ’60, ’61 was fifty cents an hour, and that actually paid rent. A nice
apartment was fifty dollars, so a hundred hours. Then I would go to
Oklahoma City about every other weekend and work a couple of jobs
with a printing company and an advertising company. So I’d run down
there and work one day and come back here and make as much as I
made in two weeks. I learned a lot in the library. Actually, I did enjoy
the work.

Wilson

Were you working with the books?

P. Brown

Working with the books, stacking books and straightening up and
whatever they had that came up that would be kind of heavy work. It
was fun. I enjoyed it.

Wilson

It sounds like you had a car?

P. Brown

Had a car, but on campus I always lived close enough—I did have a

8

bicycle, so I went about everyplace on that bike. Probably like it is now,
I know the parking is fairly limited. After you found the parking close to
your apartment, you’d like to stay right there. I had a bicycle the whole
time I was at Oklahoma State, so whether I was going to work at the
library or studying or whatever at the Union, well, I rode that bike.
C. Brown

What was gas then, twenty-five cents a gallon?

P. Brown

Oh, about thirty cents a gallon.

C. Brown

Thirty cents a gallon. We saved even on that. I bought the bicycle for
him. (Laughter)

Wilson

So you two were dating throughout the time that you were at different
schools?

C. Brown

Yes.

P. Brown

Yes.

Wilson

Would you just meet up in Oklahoma City, or would you go to Norman
much?

P. Brown

I went to Norman a number of times, but we would, on the weekends,
meet in Oklahoma City. Actually, at banquets and that type of thing here
on campus I’d go down at that time to Central State where she was
going. I would pick her up, drive her up here for a banquet, then take her
back to campus that night, late. We burned that highway up quite a bit
between here and Oklahoma City. (Laughter)

C. Brown

I bet if you turn her loose, she can make it by herself. (Laughter)

Wilson

Before coming here to college had you been on the campus before?

P. Brown

One time. One time when I was a senior in high school I did visit the
campus and really liked the campus, but then I got a scholarship to
Phillips the first year, so I tried that. Actually, my best friend at the time
and I both went to Phillips with one other high school friend of ours, so
there was three of us out of John Marshall. Just because of the programs
and degrees they had is when I decided to switch back over to Oklahoma
State, but as far as the basic English, math, and those types of things, I
did that at Phillips University.

Wilson

So you knew early on that you wanted to major in business.

P. Brown

Yes.

9

Wilson

What were some business classes you remember once you got here?

P. Brown

I enjoyed Dean [Edward] Burris that was a professor of business law. I
had Dean Burris for about three different classes over a couple of years,
the statistics and those type classes. At the time, programs at the
business school, there was a lot of case study and team case study in the
various management classes. That provided a chance to work with other
students and come up with a plan on a particular problem and this type
of thing, so I enjoyed the case studies also. I think at the time, the case
studies in the early ’60s and late ’50s, as far as the college, it was kind of
a management-type plan.

Wilson

Were there any other professors that had an influence on you?

P. Brown

Actually, at Phillips I was talking about our math courses. They had a
very difficult math instructor that I respected, quite so. He was a Dr.
Mason. I learned enough math, as far as statistics in those classes, it was
a really good background. Then, like I mentioned, Dean Burris, he was
really a special professor. I enjoyed that very much. There was a number
of professors that we had from the East Coast and then moved back, kind
of transitioned, when I was still in school.

Wilson

What were you majoring in?

C. Brown

Nursing. I really liked it, but the second semester I said, “I’d rather be
married than go straight into nursing on the floor.” I was on the BS-RN.
You had to completely leave school, go on the floor, and work. I
thought, “I’m not going to be able to see Paul any at all.” So, I thought,
“Well, I’ll just change my major.” Mother said, “If you back out, that’s
it. No more help from home.” I said, “Well, I can’t make it by myself
without scholarships,” so we got married.

Wilson

And it worked out. (Laughs)

C. Brown

And it worked out for fifty years. (Laughs)

P. Brown

She would come to the library with me every evening whether I was
working or studying, so we spent a lot of time in this library.

C. Brown

Everybody said it would only last three months. (Laughter)

Wilson

What would you do in the library when he was busy?

C. Brown

I would read. I would read.

10

P. Brown

And then help me.

C. Brown

One time, a friend and I were acting pretty silly. At the staircase before
you go out, we stood there and talked gibberish. It sounded like some
foreign language. People would walk by, “Wonder what in the world
they’re talking.” We had fun that day. We were acting silly. (Laughter)

P. Brown

We had some close friends that were also couples that married about the
time we did that we would visit and study with, also.

Wilson

What has changed about the library?

P. Brown

Well, the computer sources are just remarkable. That’s the main thing
because at that time it was books, the paperbacks. In fact, I did have a
computer class when I was a junior, and it was the old IBM 650 that
would actually fill this room up, and that was their basic starting. But the
computerized everything that’s available anymore is big, and the library,
I know, has stayed close with that.

C. Brown

I did actually get a job on campus, and I was to start on a Monday. It
was in the science lab. It was the highest paying job on campus. I felt
kind of bad, but it was true. They called me and said, “Is your husband
graduating in May?” I said, “Yes.” They said, “Well, we just can’t afford
to train you and lose you and have to train somebody over.” I understood
that, but we managed to make it. No problems. No help. When we would
go to the grocery store—there was a little grocery store on Main Street.
We spent twenty dollars a week on groceries. We didn’t go over a
penny. Sometimes we got by with less. Of course, we didn’t go to the
show but once in a blue moon. We ate well. We had steak once a week.
They even gave S&H Green Stamps, and I got birthday presents for his
mother and my mother saving green stamps wherever we went.

P. Brown

We visited Hideaway about once a month. That was a special dinner.
(Laughs)

C. Brown

That was like going to a steakhouse. (Laughter)

Wilson

What do you remember about Hideaway in the early days?

P. Brown

Well, we didn’t realize it was going to grow. We still go to several
Hideaways in Tulsa, by the way, but it was kind of special at the time.

C. Brown

There was no Joseppi's or any of the other restaurants we have. Just that
one little store, down at the middle of the campus.

Wilson

Was pizza a strange concept at the time, or had you had that in

11

Oklahoma City?
P. Brown

No, when we were dating in high school we went to a couple of
locations. Sussy’s in Oklahoma City, so that was the big date then, there
in high school.

C. Brown

First time I ever ate pizza I didn’t like it because it was so strange.

Wilson

Yes.

C. Brown

We were seniors in high school, I think, but it grows on you pretty
quickly. (Laughter)

P. Brown

It sounds like we didn’t study, but we studied a lot. (Laughter)

C. Brown

He would have study classes over at our little apartment. We had one
little tiny TV set, and on Thursday nights—what’s that program?

P. Brown

Elliot Ness.

C. Brown

Elliott Ness. All the kids would come over and watch that. It was cold in
the apartment, so in the wintertime they’d all be sitting with their coats
on, watching Elliot Ness. (Laughter)

Wilson

Where would you go to the movies if you ever went to the show?

P. Brown

On the corner across the street from the fire station, and then one
downtown, on Main…

C. Brown

That one is a furniture store now, I think.

Wilson

Furniture Showcase.

C. Brown

Yes.

Wilson

Would you ever do anything else around town?

P. Brown

We enjoyed basketball. We enjoyed the wrestling, of course, so we made
most of the wrestling matches.

C. Brown

And the concerts they’d have here. They had good ones.

Wilson

Through Allied Arts?

C. Brown

The Wills Brothers.

12

P. Brown

Through the Allied Arts, yes.

C. Brown

Yes, those where fantastic, and they were free!

P. Brown

We stayed pretty close to campus really, stayed within budget.
(Laughter)

Wilson

You showed me a photo earlier from the prom. Do you want to tell me
about the prom? We don’t have those anymore.

P. Brown

This was kind of a big thing. At the time, we’d just found out that she
was pregnant, just barely, so that prom was kind of special. We found
out later that, I guess, they had stopped the proms. But at the time, the
band was a big band. It was Les Elgart. A lot of people would recognize
the name during that time.

C. Brown

Old people will. (Laughter)

P. Brown

But it was fun. It was time to dress up and go to a dance, which we
enjoyed, so that was quite nice.

C. Brown

They didn’t wear too much formal attire. It was just nice Sunday-type
clothes.

P. Brown

Suits and that type of thing.

C. Brown

It was better on the budget. I’m sure some of the sororities and
fraternities had their big formals. I know when my daughter was here, it
was buy a formal every other week!

Wilson

Yes. (Laughter)

C. Brown

I started having them made.

P. Brown

Of course, we still had high school proms, junior and senior proms, so
that was just kind of an extension. Like I say, it was enjoyable.

Wilson

Did you have to pay anything to attend the dances?

P. Brown

We did, and I kept thinking the prom was like five dollars or something
because they did have a quite nice band. They could play rock-n-roll and
this type of thing.

Wilson

Were you involved in student organizations?

P. Brown

Yes, there was two, actually, through the business school: Alpha Kappa

13

Psi and SAM [Society for Advancement of Management], I was
members of. Then as far as any other organization, it would be kind of a
one-time thing that a class would get together and some program, even
for high schoolers coming through, we would actually meet with at times
about the types of degrees we had, that were looking at the various
campuses at the time.
Wilson

That’s nice.

C. Brown

Both of our kids joined sororities and fraternities. Our son was a Pike [Pi
Kappa Alpha] and our daughter was a Zeta, but they enjoyed it and had
fun. I spent as much time on campus that they were beginning to think I
was one of the students. (Laughs) I loved to stay over at the Zeta house
and do the things they were going and doing and stay in the room with
them. She even kept baby ducks over there for a week, and they didn’t
find them. (Laughter)

P. Brown

I can’t recall exactly the tuition at the time, but sixteen to eighteen hours,
it was running, if I remember it, less than $250. Of course, then the
books. That was probably another $100 or so. At the time, it seemed
about right, but right now as you look back, it was pretty cheap
education.

Wilson

What about buildings on campus?

P. Brown

The new Business Building, (I say “new,” it’s what, twenty years old
now or so) the Morrill building was most of the business. And the
Classroom Building, we had many classes in the Classroom Building.
Really, it’s about the same now except as far as engineering and some of
those courses. The newer Business Building is quite nice, and the trading
floor in the Business Building is quite nice.

Wilson

Have you heard they’re planning to improve the Business Building?

P. Brown

I did. I’ve seen the plans, and that really looks nice. Looking forward to
that.

Wilson

What about Old Central? Did you have any classes there?

P. Brown

I did. I had a couple of lecture classes in kind of the main auditorium of
Old Central. Sure did.

Wilson

Did you spend much time in the Student Union?

P. Brown

Yes. Really, pretty much every evening, Saturday afternoon, Sunday
afternoons. A lot of time in the Union was study, especially in the upper

14

floors. They’d have rooms that we’d go to study in, in addition to the
library. With some of those, you could converse back and forth if you
were on a team-type approach. But yes, we spent a bunch of time in the
library. Even after we got married, we still ate in there a number of
times. I made most breakfasts through the Union.
C. Brown

Paul used to keep a budget, and I still have the sheets. If he bought a
pack of gum he would put it down, five or ten cents. He did that for
years while he was going to school, so he’d know what to budget for and
how to keep track of what was going where. As a result, he saved a lot of
money. He still does it, too. (Laughter)

P. Brown

I guess an average, I had probably about three part-time jobs.

Wilson

Wow.

P. Brown

The most hours was here in the library, those hundred hours a month.
The other jobs were twenty or thirty hours per month.

C. Brown

Today’s kids just will not budget money. They don’t know where it
goes. “Oh, I spent fifty dollars this week.”

P. Brown

That may just be our kids. (Laughter)

C. Brown

Oh, just our kids. (Laughter) They just will not budget their money.
They say, “Mom and Dad will give me more. Why should I bother?”
[Our kids were thrifty like their dad.]

Wilson

Yes. That’s sure smart to start young. I’m impressed. Well, it sounds like
you were super busy.

P. Brown

I stayed pretty busy.

Wilson

You said you attended some sporting events. Do you have any
memories?

P. Brown

Coach [Henry] Iba was still here, and then the wrestling program was—
let’s see. The years I was here I guess they won two nationals. Of
course, in the middle ’40s, of course, they won two NCAA
championships. It was really an experience going to the games and
watching Coach Iba. Very respectable, he was a respected man.

Wilson

What about Homecoming? What are some of your Homecoming
memories?

P. Brown

We missed a lot of Homecoming events. The parade was always

15

especially nice, and in 1960 we had two gold medal wrestlers. Shelby
Wilson and [Doug] Blubaugh, both Ponca City wrestlers, were gold
medal winners from Oklahoma State, so that was big. The parade was
quite large, and then, of course, the ballgames. Had to make the
ballgames, so I managed to work around the hours to at least get to go to
the games. I did make one parade, and I was kind of impressed. It was a
lot larger than I expected.
Wilson

And then with your children both being involved in Greek life…

P. Brown

Oh, yes.

C. Brown

We have brought more food to this campus on football and basketball
game day, and that was before—what do you call it when you eat out of
your trunk?

Wilson

Tailgating.

P. Brown

Tailgating.

C. Brown

…before tailgating was popular. I fried chicken, made baked beans,
deviled eggs. You would think I was having lunch for the poor out there.
(Laughs) It was.

P. Brown

We would park on the south side of the stadium, between the stadium
and, at that time, the armory. We would bring a station wagon full of
food for the guys and the gals. We always had fifteen, twenty, twentyfive other students. (Laughs)

C. Brown

This one poor kid he would eat a drumstick. I mean, he would eat it all
but the middle part of the bone. I said, “You don’t eat that.” He said,
“You do when you’re hungry.” (Laughter)

P. Brown

But yes, we made all the Homecomings. We lived out of state. When
you’re in Spokane, Washington, or the Rockies or Atlanta you just miss
a lot, so when we’re here and we can drive within a few hours, we’re
going to make everything. At that time, it was difficult even to get the
scores in the Rockies, Washington, or Georgia. Now, of course, with
ESPN and the computer generation we can keep up with the scores. So
when we’re living close we make the games. When we did live out of
state, when we were able to make any of the out-of-state games of OSU,
like Lafayette, Louisiana, we’d make that when we lived in Houston. We
made a number of out-of-state games in addition to the bowl games. We
just won’t miss a bowl game as long as we’re well enough to go.
(Laughter)

16

C. Brown

Yes.

Wilson

Have you kept track of how many Homecomings you’ve attended?

P. Brown

We really haven’t, but I could say three, eight, twelve, fifteen, maybe as
many as twenty.

C. Brown

Twenty, yes. We’ve kept the same seats for how many years?

P. Brown

A long time. A lot of the part of the Homecoming we’ve missed, except
for the game, is because our son played football all through grade school
and high school. Those grade school and junior high games always came
on a Saturday morning.

C. Brown

Twelve o’clock.

P. Brown

We’d be driving down from Ponca City, and Kevin would be back there
changing clothes so he could go to the game. We would even bring the
whole team down sometimes if we could find cheap enough tickets.

Wilson

Oh, wow, that’s neat. You mentioned you’ve stayed in touch with friends
that you had here fifty years ago.

C. Brown

Yes.

Wilson

Do you want to talk about that any?

P. Brown

Arthur and Kay, they live in Marietta, Oklahoma. They were married the
same break that we were married in our junior and senior year. Ever
since then, if we’re reasonably close we still meet in Oklahoma City or
some place and kind of celebrate in between. Theirs is one weekend, and
ours is five days later. We still share that, and we are going to tomorrow.

C. Brown

We’re meeting for dinner or lunch before the game, be it basketball or
football.

P. Brown

In the last fifteen years we haven’t missed one. We do drive a number of
miles to do that. Then the college friend that we discussed and came up
here together and graduated, we visited with him in Fort Worth, Texas,
two weekends ago. He’s in city administration, and that’s the reason he
came here in the first place. So we still visit quite a few. Then also a
couple of high school buddies I also went to college with, we still keep
up with each other. One lives near San Diego. We still talk and send
emails weekly and visit fairly often. Then with having our fiftieth
wedding anniversary in January, quite a few of those, and even at our
wedding, three of people in our wedding were our close friends, also,

17

OSU grads.
C. Brown

They went to Hawaii with us.

P. Brown

Yes, they did meet us in Hawaii, so it was kind of fun.

C. Brown

That was special.

Wilson

Yes, it is!

P. Brown

So we stayed very close to a lot of the grads.

Wilson

What are some of the most special memories you recall from your time
here?

P. Brown

Of course, the graduation was quite nice. It was fun, because I never
really had to struggle on grades that much. I studied a lot, and that
helped. Another thing I think everybody would remember, for the 1961
graduates, we had Vietnam, and the draft was still in at the time. Most of
us just took our chances after graduation. Three of the fellows I roomed
with and still visit with, actually, all three of them went to officer school.
I was the only of the four that did not, so that was kind of on
everybody’s mind at the time. If you made your grades it was a big help.
Then it was really fun after we did finally get married. We didn’t have to
drive back and forth to Oklahoma City. That helped on grades and
helped on studying. She’s quite a good cook, so we ate in the apartment
a lot. Then by the time we left Oklahoma State, just before we left
Oklahoma State, then we found out she was expecting, so that was really
kind of special. They all came down here. Teresa came down here, and
so did Kevin, in the ’80s graduates.

C. Brown

They had so much fun, especially Teresa, when they first put the
Astroturf down. She remembers walking on the turf, getting to feel of it
and test it and jump on it. She just couldn’t believe that was fake grass.
(Laughter)

P. Brown

I was proud of it, and I loaded them up in Ponca City and brought all of
them down here so we could look at the new surface at the football
stadium. (Laughs) Of course, it’s a beautiful location right now.

Wilson

Did either of your parents attend college?

P. Brown

Her mother and father, both, OU. Her dad’s a graduate of OU. Well,
let’s see, a graduate of SMU and went to OU law school. My father went
to Central State for one year. Another reason I looked at OSU, I had an

18

uncle that’s a graduate engineer from Oklahoma State, Oklahoma A&M
at that time, so we were kind of leaning that direction.
Wilson

I read that you are interested in genealogy.

P. Brown

Yes.

C. Brown

Yes, that’s his love.

P. Brown

I’ve been doing that. I’ve slowed down a lot, but that’s been kind of a
twenty-five year process. Now it’s an easy process with online
information, and so much information now is available. Those are one of
the late-night or in the middle of the winter when you can’t play golf,
that’s what I do.

C. Brown

He hasn’t found any bad men, cattle rustlers, or horse thieves or
anything like that.

Wilson

I’m surprised. Most people have a little bit somewhere in there.
(Laughter) What about Theta Pond?

C. Brown

Oh! (Laughs) Tell the truth, now. (Laughter)

P. Brown

Well, I did get pitched in Theta Pond. It was easy, though, of all things.
It was frozen, so they made me go out quite a ways and lay down in it,
four of my good friends.

C. Brown

You said they went with you.

P. Brown

Well, that was when I was at Phillips.

C. Brown

Oh, that was at Phillips, okay.

P. Brown

This was a marriage-type thing. Yes, that’s the only thing. Then of
course, Theta Pond, we walked around it many times since we were just
two blocks south after we got married.

C. Brown

I used to love walking around it. I thought it was so pretty just to walk
around it and sit down and enjoy the scene and watch the ducks and all
the pretty flowers they had.

Wilson

Yes, it’s a real special location. What is it about Oklahoma State that
sparks loyalty in its students and alums?

P. Brown

I think that’s just the campus people themselves.

19

C. Brown

The friendliness of the campus.

P. Brown

The friendliness of the campus, all the way from working with the
professors. I guess we’re far enough away from a large city that when
you go to Oklahoma State, you pretty much live here. You live on
campus or around campus, and that helps, versus going to a school
where you can commute and this type of thing. Even being in a
fraternity, I still have a lot of good friends from high school that went
here. As far as meeting people and meeting people in class and the
activities they had, it’s really like—I think with the campus people living
around the campus and very few commuting, you get a lot of interaction
with activities around campus. They do have a lot of activities.

C. Brown

That’s true because when I was going to school in Edmond, we called it
the suitcase college. Everybody left on weekends. If you were left up in
a dorm, you were by yourself, practically. Nobody around, nothing to
do, just study, which might’ve helped. But the friendliness of this
campus, because not that many do go home, it’s just a big happy family
situation.
There are always things going on.

Wilson
Right, there’s always things going on.
C. Brown
P. Brown

And OSU, President Hargis and all of them, they kept track, they kept
current with the classes, and they kept current with facilities, the
educational-type facilities. That was a big part.
You’ve touched on this some, but how has OSU impacted your life?

Wilson
P. Brown

Wilson

Before I was recruited on campus by Conoco, actually Conoco Pipeline,
(there was a number of us that were recruited, actually, for the same
training program that I went on) just with Conoco recruiting on campus,
a larger-type campus, that was a big impact. The people you meet and
some of the instructors that you’re close to, you really want to do good
for them. They really notice if you’re working, if you’re working for a
grade or not, if you’re working to learn. As far as us going to work for
Conoco in 1961, we were still just coming out of a recession. The job
recruiters, there were a number of them, but they were down. We were
quite happy to get a couple of offers, and the Conoco one we accepted.
From there, they had a number of managers and engineers also from
OSU. That was one of the big impacts. We’re just proud of our
Oklahoma State graduation and degree.
Could you tell me a little bit more about the actual graduation ceremony
or the day you graduated?

20

P. Brown

It was interesting. For quite some years, you have a lot of pictures
available, and my graduation, and the robe and this type of thing, there’s
a picture of me in my robe and hat, two blocks south of campus.
By our little apartment.

C. Brown
P. Brown

We did graduate in the stadium at that time. It was Lewis Field. It was
nice weather.
Did you say yellow robe?

Wilson
No, black.
C. Brown
P. Brown

Gray. A dark, dark, dark gray. Of course, everybody had their different
colored tassel, depending on which school they were in, which major
they were in. At the time, it was—I forget the total. I think it was like
five or six thousand that graduated that day or walked across. Now, of
course, I guess they’re breaking it down by Business School,
engineering, this type of thing, which is so many. We had enough we all
graduated in Lewis Field, and we were lucky it was nice weather.
Did your family come?

Wilson
Yes. Yes, they did.
P. Brown
And then how long after graduation did you all move?
Wilson
Two weeks. (Laughter) We packed up and moved to Oklahoma City…
P. Brown
We didn’t have much.
C. Brown
P. Brown

C. Brown

…where both of our families lived. I think we started in Casper,
Wyoming. We made quite a few moves early in the training program
and some construction projects. We went from Casper to Cheyenne to
Spokane and back down to Ponca City and Louisiana, and ended up in
Atlanta, Georgia. We made quite a few moves in the first ten years. Then
after that, they slowed down quite a bit. It was fun. We were looking
forward to graduation, ready to go to work, accomplish something.
With his penny pinching and saving, when he moved he actually had
enough money. The company offered to pay for the move. We had a few
chairs and things like that. He said, “No, I’ll pay for it. I have enough.
You can reimburse me.”
No, they reimbursed me. (Laughter)

21

P. Brown

I just said that. They reimbursed him, but he was so proud that he had
enough to say, “No, I’ll pay for it myself.” (Laughter)

C. Brown
Yes, that’s nice. What area did you work in at Conoco?
Wilson
P. Brown

At the Conoco Pipeline. It was a subsidiary of Conoco, operating a
common carrier pipeline system, also terminal basically from coast to
coast and north to south. When I say operation of pipelines, it’s remote
control. The actual pump stations, the lines themselves, it was the actual
operation of that pipeline system as a common carrier.
No, he didn’t dig pipelines. (Laughter)

C. Brown

We did go on the construction projects, which we enjoyed, at various
locations.

P. Brown
C. Brown

P. Brown

I’d never traveled, and this was so exciting to get to see all these places.
My family never went on vacation, and that was so exciting. My mother
had always been ill, and we had to watch our Ps and Qs so she could
stay close to home. So I got to see the world. Before, I hadn’t seen
anything. I didn’t mind moving.
Another thing, mentioning that and talking about the impact, is this
article that’s in a magazine. I’ve been fighting male breast cancer and
pushing people, men, to check for male breast cancer for ten years.
Connie had it last year, but we still made…
All the sports events and the basketball games.

C. Brown

…all the activities.

P. Brown

There were times when I was hanging on to things and grabbing. Two of
the staff workers saw me, and they thought I was going to pass out. They
emerged on our little stair steps, and I said, “I am going to show them I
can do it.” (Laughter)

C. Brown

But it was kind of a goal to make those OSU visits and visit those OSU
people. That’s a big help.
P. Brown
Talk about loyalty. (Laughter) Do you want to talk about your
experiences with that anymore?
Wilson
P. Brown

Hers was quite serious at one time, and she’s clean now. I’ve still got
some work to do, but what I’ve been trying to push for years is to
educate men. It’s very simple to check for. I don’t know. I had probably

22

nineteen or twenty physicals while I was working and before and after,
and they didn’t catch it until it got in the lymph system. So I’ve been
pushing what I can in Tulsa to get, not the facilities, but the people in
those facilities need to train men to look for male breast cancer. Granted,
there’s not but about three thousand, thirty-five hundred a year. That’s
what’s found, not what’s out there. They lose nearly 20 percent of those
because they are so far advanced. You’ll see me every once in a while
just pushing those guys to check for themselves, have their wives or
girlfriends or whatever. It’s a simple, simple test. You can’t catch all of
them, but at least they recognize it before it gets in the lymph system.

C. Brown

His is still in the lymph system. He had to have a mastectomy, and a
radical one at that, where they go in under the arm and take out all the
lymph nodes. They took seventeen positive ones out…
Wow.

Wilson

…so they have to watch that now. They’ve been watching him with PET
scans and ultrasounds and different sightseeing tests they do.

C. Brown
It was kind of a point we made the OSU events. That was just kind of
one thing we would push for.
P. Brown
C. Brown

P. Brown

C. Brown

A lot of women just don’t want to go to the doctor and face the facts that
they’re not well, but it’s your life and you’re worth it. You need to go
and do a biopsy or a PET scan, whatever they can do. Mammograms
definitely every year after forty-five, some before. The government is
trying to push, “Well, we don’t think but every five years,” but I
disagree. We need it every year.
But anyhow, bottom line, as far as OSU, it did help. Just having the
friends and meeting with the friends and continuing. The travel was
reduced a little bit, but we would still make all the events here. We
missed a bowl game this last year, but we’ll catch up. (Laughter)
I don’t look it now, but I did lose forty-five pounds because I just
wouldn’t eat. The food, I just couldn’t stand it. The thought of food just
turned me upside-down.
But you made the sporting events.

Wilson

But I made the sporting events, yes. (Laughter)

C. Brown

That’s wonderful.

Wilson

And pop, I couldn’t stand the taste of pop, but now I have to watch it.

23

(Laughter)
C. Brown
Well, what advice would you give to OSU students today or to students
thinking about coming to OSU?
Wilson
P. Brown

First, they’re going to get a very recognized degree. I don’t care what
school they’re in, engineering, business, or even education like our
daughter was, they’re going to be leaving with a very recognized school.
That was one reason I transferred up here. So I’d say, “Come up here,
apply for a scholarship, and get ready to start to learn. You’re going to
meet a lot of friends and be able to attend a lot of activities and really see
a lot of people worldwide.” Every state we travel to, there is really a
large alumni association in about every place we’ve been to, plus the
office. Of course, the Conoco offices have had quite a few. I’m really
proud of my degree from OSU and both my, I say “kids,” forty-nine and
forty-six.
They’re still your kids. (Laughter)

Wilson

Always will be.

C. Brown

They’re very proud of theirs also. My daughter has been in education, a
teacher, since ’84, since she graduated here.

P. Brown
C. Brown

P. Brown

Her degree was in FRCD, Family Relations and Childhood
Development. She’s been a kindergarten teacher, and she really loves it.
She’s done that. She just thinks there’s nothing better than kindergarten
kids.
When she graduated, in the teaching profession there was just not a
whole lot of openings. I honestly feel that OSU graduation had a lot to
do with that. I would definitely come back. We didn’t have to push very
hard for both of our kids to come here. The one granddaughter will be
here next year. We didn’t have to push her very much because she
comes over a lot.
She’ll be here tomorrow.

C. Brown

She will be here for the Homecoming.

P. Brown

Or tonight, too.

C. Brown

Does she live in Tulsa?

Wilson

Yes.

24

C. Brown

Yes, yes.

P. Brown

She’s a good student, too. Works full-time.

C. Brown

She’s a good student. She looks forward to coming over here.

P. Brown

Well, we’re excited to have her.

Wilson

We’re all real tall, and we call her a munchkin because she hits us about
right here. (Laughter)

C. Brown
Good kid.
P. Brown

Well, is there anything else that we haven’t covered that you all would
like to talk about?

Wilson
No. You covered the things that we really wanted to say. We really love
OSU.
P. Brown
Is there anything else you want to ask us? (Laughter)
C. Brown

Not that I can think of.

Wilson

You’ve pretty much covered everything. You’ve got the things that’s
really special to us from OSU. Then I did want to get out what campus
salaries were then, which is kind of fun. We enjoyed it.

P. Brown

I don’t think the students could make it on twenty dollars a week
nowadays, though. (Laughter) That’ll last one day, maybe.
C. Brown
Maybe two meals. (Laughter)
Wilson

It’s a different system, but we appreciate all of it.

P. Brown

Well, thank you so much for visiting with me today, and have a
wonderful Homecoming weekend!

Wilson
Well, thank you!
C. Brown

Thank you.
