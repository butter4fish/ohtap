Carolyn Garber
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Latasha Wilson
October 28, 2011
Stillwater, Oklahoma
Wilson

My name is Latasha Wilson, and I’m with the Oklahoma Oral History
Research Program at the OSU Library. Today is October 28, 2011, and
I am talking with Carolyn Garber here at the OSU Library. Thank you
for being with us today.

Garber

Well, thank you. It’s a pleasure, Latasha.

Wilson

Welcome back to OSU for your fifty-year class reunion.

Garber

Yes. (Laughs)

Wilson

Are there any particular reasons why you decided to attend your
reunion?

Garber

It worked out really well because last Saturday night was the one
hundredth birthday for the church that my family actually started. My
grandfather was a charter member of that church, so we decided to
extend our vacation (well, we’re retired now, so no days of vacation
anymore) to this weekend so I could also go to the fiftieth reunion. I
probably would’ve come anyway, but it really worked out well.

Wilson

And that church was in Stillwater?

Garber

Yes, and it was Salem Lutheran Church.

Wilson

Oh, wow!

4

Garber

It started out, actually, about seventeen miles west of here. It was called
the Friedens Church when it began, but in 1911 [the church was built in
Stillwater and named Salem Lutheran Church and was located on Ninth
and Duncan Streets.].

Wilson

Wow, that’s neat.

Garber

Yes, so that was a great celebration, and I’m looking forward to this one.

Wilson

Are there any particular events or things you’re interested in doing
while you’re here, centered around Homecoming?

Garber

I am taking in everything that they have assigned me to or that they have
put on the list. (Laughter) My husband is being very gracious and is
attending most of those things with me. Today we have this wonderful
coffee at ten o’clock at the College of Human Sciences and then a
luncheon, and this afternoon we’re going to do a golf [cart] tour of the
campus. This campus has expanded greatly. This campus is one of the
most beautiful campuses, and I have been to many because my husband
was in college administration. I’ve been to many campuses, but this is
just still one of the top. It is a beautiful campus.

Wilson

Well, let’s back up a little, and tell me about your early life, where you
were born and…

Garber

Okay. I was born on a farm northwest of Stillwater, Oklahoma, in 1940.
That farmhouse still exists. We no longer own that. It was sold, I
believe, in maybe 1996. My parents, of course, are both deceased, but
this was a family farm that was in the family from about 1913 to 1996.

Wilson

Wow.

Garber

So that’s where I lived. I lived in that house and went to school at
Oklahoma State University.

Wilson

And you graduated from Stillwater High School?

Garber

Graduated from—then it was Stillwater High School, yes.

Wilson

What year did you graduate?

Garber

Nineteen fifty-seven.

Wilson

Did you always know that you would attend OSU since you were from
Stillwater?

5

Garber

Yes. At that time, there weren’t too many students from Stillwater High
School that went out to other places. Many of us went to Oklahoma State
University. I think there were a few that went to other schools. Today, I
think kids spread out a little bit more, but in those days we all just
wanted to—it was Oklahoma State.

Wilson

Were you a first-generation college student, or had your parents
attended?

Garber

No, my parents hadn’t, but I have two uncles that have at least
bachelor’s degrees, and one has a master’s degree from OSU. At that
time, it was Oklahoma A&M. But neither parent, no.

Wilson

Do you have siblings?

Garber

I have three siblings, and one graduated, also, from OSU and has a
master’s from OSU. The other two attended but did not graduate from
OSU.

Wilson

So you started in 1957.

Garber

Nineteen fifty-seven, and I graduated in 1961.

Wilson

And did you live at home your first year, or did you move onto campus?

Garber

Most of the time I either lived at home or with a sister in town or my
grandmother. I only lived on campus for about nine weeks, and that was
in the sorority house my senior year.

Wilson

What sorority was that?

Garber

Alpha Chi Omega.

Wilson

Okay. Did you decide your major from the beginning?

Garber

Very early. As a young child, I decided I wanted to teach home
economics. That was because a wonderful home demonstration agent
came out to a one-room country school where I went to school my first
seven years, and I just thought that’d be the neatest job in the world, and
I never left that idea. (Laughs) I have no idea, but I’ve always enjoyed it.
Then I got more interested in the dietetics world, and so I put the
emphasis on dietetics rather than just home economics education.

Wilson

What was the name of the one-room school you attended?

Garber

Fair Plains.

6

Wilson

And where was that located?

Garber

It was, again, northwest of Stillwater. I believe it’s called Lakeview
Road, now.

Wilson

Okay.

Garber

That school is no longer in existence, period. My father was president of
the school board there, and we were active. But then, of course, it got
annexed to Stillwater schools because we only had, I think, thirteen in
the school in my seventh grade. (Laughter)

Wilson

Then did you ride the bus into Stillwater?

Garber

We did. We rode the bus every day. Yes, we did. It was a long ride. Kids
complain about that today, but we had a long ride. I bet you it was at
least forty-five minutes long…

Wilson

Wow.

Garber

…but we just did it. We just did it.

Wilson

Did you live on the farm the whole time you were growing up?

Garber

Yes, I did. I did until I left here in 1961.

Wilson

What were some classes that you particularly remember?

Garber

I really liked my nutrition classes, and I liked my chemistry classes. I
thought the chemistry teachers were just fantastic. I suppose those were
my top classes that I really appreciated so much. Of course, I liked all of
the classes over in the College of Human Sciences. That’s what it’s
called now. I thought the teachers were very caring, and they got you
very involved. We had smaller classes, so I appreciated that. I would say
those were my favorites.

Wilson

Were there any faculty members that were particularly influential in
your development?

Garber

I was trying to think of names because I thought you might ask me that
question. The nutrition instructor, Miss Leidigh, Mary Leidigh, was in
food nutrition for a long time and even sent us wonderful newsletters
after we graduated, which I thought was very nice. Miss [Mary] Currier
—I believe it started with a C. I think it was Currier. She was a
wonderful nutrition teacher. I was trying to think of my chemistry

7

teacher. I knew my high school chemistry teacher, but I could not
remember the name of that chemistry teacher. I can picture her, but I’d
need to look through my yearbook, I guess, to figure that out. By the
way, in those days, we had the Redskin. I have no idea if you still do this
at OSU, but we had these wonderful, huge yearbooks that had
everything in them. Maybe that’s changed, too.
Wilson

It has. They don’t do those anymore, (Laughter) but during
Homecoming, the library sets out a collection of the Redskins down in
the lobby so people that are here for Homecoming can look through.

Garber

Well, I have my Redskins, and I still look back through them. People
will look through that now and say, “Oh, my! Look at that,” because
even looking at the basketball uniforms, you realize how much things
have changed.

Wilson

Yes. Do you remember any buildings that your classes were in?

Garber

Oh, sure. The College of Human [Sciences], that building is still in
existence because that’s the one we’re going to today. The food nutrition
classes were in a small little building on more of the eastern side of the
campus. I don’t know if that building is still there or not. It was old and
kind of a derelict then. I don’t know if it still exists. The Classroom
Building. A lot of our chemistry labs were in Quonset huts just on the
north side of this library. Those are probably all gone.

Wilson

Yes, they are.

Garber

The Classroom Building, is that still in existence? That’s where a lot of
our main classes were in those days.

Wilson

Did you have any classes in Old Central?

Garber

English class. I took summer school, I believe it was either between my
senior in high school and freshman year. I took English. That was in Old
Central. That was the only class I had in Old Central. I’ll be sure and
show my husband that today, Old Central. Really nice that they’ve kept
that as it should be for historic sake. That is a very important building
because I believe it was the first building on this campus.

Wilson

I think so, and now the Honors College is held there.

Garber

Oh, okay. Oh, that’s good.

Wilson

They’ve really done some nice improvements to it recently.

8

Garber

That’s wonderful.

Wilson

Did you study in the library?

Garber

Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Many, many nights were spent in the library.

Wilson

Did you have a favorite spot?

Garber

We called them carrels in those days. “Which carrel were we going to?”
Sometimes on first floor, either end of the first floor, and sometimes up
on second floor, I believe. I don’t remember exactly. Many evenings I
spent here at this library.

Wilson

Do you remember there being a dress code?

Garber

I don’t remember specifically a dress code. In those days, we didn’t wear
blue jeans. That was not a part of our dress. I believe we did start
wearing slacks during that time, but we mostly wore skirts. It was, I
guess, the thing you did. You didn’t think about it.

Wilson

We’ve heard a lot of people talk about the curfews in the dorms.

Garber

Yes.

Wilson

If you were living off campus, did everything close down at a certain
time?

Garber

I just remember my friends, my girlfriends, in dormitories, of course, it
was just strictly all girls dorms or boys dorms. I’m sure those are
intermingled today. I don’t know, but a lot of campuses do that today.
They always had curfews when they had to be in, but most of the time I
was home. I’ve always been a morning person and not a night person. I
still am that to this day. I can get up at five or six o’clock, do my
exercise, all that stuff, and go, go, go, go, and by ten or eleven o’clock, I
want to be in bed. I haven’t changed.
The other thing that was different then is that it was still a dry state until
1959, okay? I don’t know quite how that law became—I know that’s
when Oklahoma no longer became a dry state, in 1959, so in 1957, all
the way through college, you did not see any drinking at all. As a
sorority member, we were told not to imbibe. (Laughter) I’m sure that’s
changed a little bit today. (Laughter) I know people say, “How could
you have handled that, Carolyn? My goodness!” because every college,
they go dah, dah, dah. I said, “Well, I don’t know.” That’s how we grew
up, and there was never any bar. There weren’t any bars, and there
weren’t any places to get alcohol. There weren’t any liquor stores, so

9

that’s what you did.
Wilson

So in 1959 do you recall there being much of a change?

Garber

No, not at that time. I think it took time for that all to—then I came back
to visit because I have family, of course, that lived here. We’d come
back to visit, and my sister said, “Well, we can go out now, Carolyn, and
you can bring in your own bottle.” I think that’s how it was, and you
could buy setups at first. Now I noticed that you can walk in and order a
cocktail if you so desire. I haven’t done that in Stillwater yet, but I did
that in Oklahoma City the other night. (Laughter)

Wilson

Were you involved in campus activities or organizations?

Garber

Oh, I was. I loved campus! I did not go through Rush at the beginning of
my freshman year. I went through Rush after Rush week. I met a nice
girl in my chemistry class, and she happened to be an Alpha Chi Omega.
We got to know each other really well, and that’s probably how I got
invited to become an Alpha Chi Omega. I enjoyed that because it was a
way to have social friends, and on a big campus you need some kind of a
group, I think, to identify with. That was really good for me. They were
a really nice group of girls.
Then I got involved with the Home Economics Club at that time. Also, I
was really active in the Lutheran Student Association. Then that led me
to the University Religious Council (which I don’t even know if that
club exists) and various other organizations I belonged to. Then later, I
was asked to be a part of Mortar Board, and we rode in a parade on
tandem bicycles. I don’t know if they still do that anymore, but that was
lots of fun. We had our little white blazers on, and we had black shorts. I
have a picture of that. That’d probably be an archival picture of riding in
the parade and throwing out candy from the tandem bicycles. Oh, yes.

Wilson

Yes, we would love a copy. (Laughter)

Garber

Yes, I do have a copy of that. Someone took a picture. It’s your senior
year, of course, when we did that. So, yes, activities were very, very
important to be in. I think college has a great purpose. It teaches you a
discipline, but it also teaches you how to analyze, how to do some
critical thinking, how to evaluate, how to put your ideas together. That’s
one reason college has such an important part for me in my life.

Wilson

What were some activities you would do for fun?

Garber

Well, we had, of course, all these crazy things like hayrides.

10

Wilson

Who organized the hayrides?

Garber

A sorority or fraternity would organize, or a dormitory. The farmers
would come in, and my father used to do that sometimes. You bring the
hayrack in, and they put sides on it, and you’d all climb on the hayrack.
You’d drive out to a farm someplace, and they do a big wiener roast.
That was a big deal. Probably would not be a big deal to kids today, but
it was lots of fun. We had dances, and there were a lot of things going
on.

Wilson

Where would you hang out on campus or off campus?

Garber

Student Union a lot.

Wilson

What do you remember about the Student Union?

Garber

Just a nice place to go over and take a break. I never drank coffee in
those days. That was an adult thing I learned later in life, I guess. In
college I didn’t drink coffee. I thought it had such a bitter taste. Isn’t that
crazy? Now I think it’s wonderful. Yes, I would say the Student Union
was kind of my hangout. Walking around Theta Pond. I’m so glad that
that has been kept in its beauty because it’s just a gorgeous spot,
particularly in the spring and the fall. It was a nice place to go sit and
take a break, or sit out in front of the library. We’d go do that and take a
break. Then you’d go back in and study.

Wilson

Was there any other wildlife around Theta Pond at the time?

Garber

Just those ducks. They’re still there.

Wilson

Well, we’ve heard a few stories about an alligator that lived in the pond.
(Laughter)

Garber

Well, now, I never saw the alligator. (Laughter)

Wilson

Did you ever witness anyone being thrown into Theta Pond?

Garber

Yes, my brother-in-law. They used to do that after people were married,
and he had to wheel my sister down in a wheelbarrow, down Main Street
in Stillwater. Then they took him to Theta Pond and threw him in. So I
witnessed that, but I didn’t witness other people being thrown in. Does
that happen on a regular basis now?

Wilson

Well, not now, but back then apparently it happened when people were
engaged or if they got married or…

11

Garber

I don’t remember any of that. Well, in the sorority you had these pinning
things, or when you blow a candle out when you sing the song or
whatever. I remember that, but I don’t remember anyone being thrown
in. Maybe fraternities did that. I don’t know.

Wilson

Did you play Bridge?

Garber

I didn’t then. I learned that in 1961 when I went to Europe. After I
graduated, I went to Europe on a study group for ten weeks, and that’s
when I learned to play Bridge. A lot of my sorority sisters played
Bridge. That was a big thing, and to watch the soap operas. They did that
in the afternoon sometimes. I remember those things.

Wilson

Do you remember any particular soap operas?

Garber

No, because I never watched them. I mean, I just remember them talking
about whatever happened that day, and they had to see what was going
to happen. I don’t particularly remember the names, no.

Wilson

When you did live in the sorority, did you eat in the sorority?

Garber

Yes, I did. I think students did a student teaching for nine weeks or ten
weeks, something like that. That’s when they had vacancies, and so
some of us in the local community could move in for that nine weeks to
fill in the void. That was really a nice experience for me, yes.

Wilson

Did you ever have to do any time in the Home Management House?

Garber

I did not do that because I had a minor in home economics education,
and I would’ve had to fulfill that at a later time. I didn’t do it, also,
because I was working and going to school.

Wilson

Where did you work?

Garber

At R. Jay Cleaners, which is long gone by now. It was on Washington
Street. That’s where I worked. I started there as a junior in high school
and worked through my senior year.

Wilson

Of college?

Garber

College, yes. It helped pay the bills because I had to pay for all my own
college education.

Wilson

How much would you work in a week? Do you remember?

Garber

Oh, probably twenty hours, twenty-five hours, something like that,

12

whatever I could work in, in between classes.
Wilson

Did you ever attend any Allied Arts events?

Garber

Yes, those were very important. We got four or five, at that time, free
tickets. As a student, you got these tickets to go, and you also got your
football tickets. I don’t know how that works today, but if you were a
full-time student, you were able to go to those things, yes. Any concerts
that I could go to when they’d bring in a symphony, or they’d bring in a
group to play. I remember seeing a Kingston Trio. One time they came
in here, and that was a wonderful, wonderful event. That was in the Field
House then, which is now what I believe you call Gallagher-Iba, at that
time.

Wilson

What about sporting events? Did you attend many?

Garber

A few. I attended football games. We had to trade because we had to
work on Saturdays down there at R. Jay Cleaners. I was the cashier and
in charge of the furs my senior year and stuff. So, whenever we could,
we tried to switch off between two or three of us so we could attend
football games and some basketball games, maybe a few wrestling
matches, not too many. Girls’ sports were just kind of non-existent in
those days. You look through the Redskin, and you’ll see that. I’m just
so glad that things have improved for women. They really have. Now
there are sporting teams for you, and we didn’t have that.

Wilson

That’s a big change.

Garber

Sure.

Wilson

You just mentioned that you were in charge of furs?

Garber

Yes, people would bring their furs to the furrier, and we had cold
storage. I had to write up the contract and make sure of everything, and
then check it back out to them when they came and picked it up in the
fall. They’d bring it in the spring. (Laughter)

Wilson

So you would just house them for the summer?

Garber

Yes, in this cold storage unit. Yes, it was a huge cold storage unit they
had at the cleaners. Some people would bring all their winter clothes.
We’d clean them and bag them, and then I was just in charge of making
sure that they were in the right place and everybody could find them.
Hey, it was a job, and it worked.

Wilson

Do you recall how much someone would pay to keep their fur coat over

13

the summer? (Laughs)
Garber

I don’t remember that amount. I just don’t remember. At the time, I
probably thought it was expensive, but I don’t remember.

Wilson

That’s interesting.

Garber

I think people sometimes still do that today, but now, with different
kinds of homes and everything, people probably don’t do that as much.

Wilson

Did you date in college?

Garber

Of course. (Laughter)

Wilson

Where would you go on dates?

Garber

Movies, and then there were always activities. Sororities and fraternities
had so many different dances and groups going, and the Student Union
would have activities going on. If there was a sporting event, you went
to a sporting event. A lot of different organizations had different kinds of
activities, so that’s what you would do.

Wilson

Would you ever go to any restaurants or soda shops off campus?

Garber

Not so much in those days. I don’t remember a gentleman ever—in
those days, you always expected the gentleman to ask you out, just going
out for dinner. I just don’t think you did that.

Wilson

Did you have a car?

Garber

No. My parents had a car, and sometimes I was able to use that, but I did
not have a car. Many students did not have cars in those days. There
were a few, but I would say that was a rarity rather than commonplace.
Some guys had cars. The gentlemen seemed to have cars more than the
ladies.

Wilson

Would you ever go out to Yost Lake?

Garber

Yost Lake, yes. Maybe I went out there one time. There was also
Boomer Lake at that time, Lake Carl Blackwell, but rare visits to those
places.

Wilson

Do you remember emphasis weeks like Religious Emphasis Week or
Howdy Week or…

Garber

Well, Homecoming week, that was always a big thing. As my husband

14

and I parked at the OSU Foundation this morning and were welcomed
there, then we walked to campus. As we walked by the Sigma Chis, I
believe, (I’m not sure whether that’s the right house) they were so busy
working. I can remember working midnights, getting floats ready. We
did huge floats in those days for the parade. I’ll be interested in what
they have tomorrow.
Wilson

Are you going?

Garber

Oh, yes! I’m taking in everything I can this weekend. I’m here, and I
want to see what it was like. Even though fifty years ago, you don’t quite
—Homecoming was a huge weekend. We also had various contests on
campus. I’m not for sure what they were called, but they had these
singing groups that performed, and different groups got together and
rehearsed a lot. I remember we sang “Bali Hai.” (Laughs) I’m not for
sure what that was all about. I believe we had a Religious Week in
University Religious Council that I was president of for either one or
two years. We brought in various speakers on campus. I think Haile
Selassie from Ethiopia came here, and because of my leadership roles I
believe I got to shake his hand. That was kind of an important day.

Wilson

Yes, that’s pretty neat.

Garber

Well, I learned a lot. I think organizations are very important in a
student’s life, and getting involved with something gives you leadership
responsibilities and your ability to communicate and organize. Of
course, I enjoyed that, so it helped me grow and mature as a person.

Wilson

Well, more about Homecoming, was it a whole week of activities besides
the pomping and preparing?

Garber

I just remember the preparing because we’d have to take our time slot to
work on the float. We didn’t have housing decorations so much those
days. They did floats. I just remember everybody had to work on it so
many hours, putting in the crepe paper and cutting it and all that stuff,
and designing it, of course. You were busy.

Wilson

Would you always go to the Homecoming football game?

Garber

Tried to if I didn’t have to work, yes. Homecoming was—the parade, I
thought, was a wonderful thing. It was always a big thing at OSU
campus. It wasn’t considered a minor thing. It was a big thing. I think it
still must be pretty big.

Wilson

Yes, it is. (Laughter) It’s big.

15

Garber

It’s a major event!

Wilson

Yes, for sure. Well, I guess if you started in 1957, the university had just
switched names to Oklahoma State?

Garber

Just a few years before that, I believe.

Wilson

Was there still any discussion about that or opinions? Being from
Stillwater, did you hear people grumbling or in praise of the name
switch?

Garber

I would say that people thought it was a good thing to switch to
Oklahoma State University. I didn’t ever hear any grumbling about it. I
also remember my father bringing us to the Student Union when it was
first dedicated. That was some time before that, but when the Student
Union had a dedication, we went to it.

Wilson

Do you remember some of the events surrounding that? Was there a
ribbon cutting or…

Garber

Yes, yes, the traditional things, but they’re not specific in my mind. It
was the reception, and it was all very nice, the band playing and so forth.
The band has always been an important part. I’ve always liked music, so
that’s been an important part of my life. In my professional life, too,
music has been very important. I played in the high school band, not in
the college band.

Wilson

What did you play?

Garber

French horn.

Wilson

What about the Pistol Pete mascot?

Garber

Oh, yes, he was around then. (Laughs) It’s okay. He was certainly
around. It was nothing major in my life, but it was okay. (Laughs) It’s
good to have those things.

Wilson

Do you remember any big issues that students were talking about on
campus at the time?

Garber

No, I don’t remember anything big that would cause a big controversy at
the time. I think they had a panty raid once in a girls’ dormitory. That
was probably one of the things most talked about. (Laughs) But, no, I
don’t. Elections were talked about. We had mock presidential elections.
There was always some political discussion, but I don’t remember any
controversial issue.

16

Wilson

Well, is there one place on campus that is very special to you?

Garber

Well, I would say the library and the Student Union still hold really
special spots for me. Of course, I spent time at the sorority house. That’s
changed, too. I walked by that house today, and I think it’s now the Phi
Delta Theta house. Those things, but I would say the Union and the
library still hold really special in my heart. Classroom Building, that’s a
classroom, so those don’t hold too many special spots. The food
nutrition building, I spent so much time there my senior year, it was like
I lived there. (Laughter)

Wilson

What are some of your favorite memories from your time at OSU?

Garber

Being accepted for who you were and what you did was so much
different than high school, and I really appreciated that at OSU. In high
school, it’s very cliquish. If you were not from a wealthy family in high
school, you were considered like a nobody. I came to college, and that
was just a totally different picture. You were accepted for what you
could do in the classroom, for who you could be, and for who you were.
It had nothing to do with your income. It had nothing to do with the car
you drove. It was such an accepting environment that that’s what
stimulated me to excel. I’m very thankful for that. I did not feel I was
judged based on those things that I consider to be very small in life, so I
would say that was what I really enjoyed at OSU, and it encouraged me
to go on.
There wasn’t a professor I didn’t have that didn’t encourage you to
achieve your highest potential and who you were. I taught for twentyseven years, worked as a dietician for many years, and one thing I’ve
always tried to emphasize to the young is that thinking and studying, it
makes it worth it. Even at the time that you don’t think it’s so important,
it really is important.

Wilson

OSU obviously had a big impact on your life and opening up your future
and allowing you to grow.

Garber

Oh, absolutely. Oh, yes. I wouldn’t be able to have done the things I’ve
done without having been able to go to school, and I really appreciate
that. I think OSU also makes the community of Stillwater a better place.
Culturally, intellectually, environmentally, there’s just so many things
that OSU adds to this community of Stillwater, Oklahoma. It would be a
lost little community without OSU.

Wilson

What is it about Oklahoma State that sparks loyalty in students and
alumni?

17

Garber

Well, I think when you’ve gone to a school that you really liked, you
always have an attached loyalty to it. It’s hard to take that away. I really
have a difficult time—even though OU is a nice place and if they win in
football, that’s not a big deal to me, but I still am pretty loyal to OSU
just because it was the place that I went to school, and I have a loyalty to
it. They treated me right, I learned a lot, and I think I’m a better person
because I went to Oklahoma State.

Wilson

Well, you said you went to Europe after you graduated.

Garber

I did.

Wilson

Where did you go in Europe?

Garber

Well, in 1961, the Lutheran Church, National Lutheran Council, they
posted this little sign at the Lutheran Student Association over at Salem
Lutheran and said, “Apply to go to study abroad.” I thought, “Oh, that’s
what I want to do. I want to go someplace.” So I applied, and luckily I
was one chosen. They chose fifteen of us from across the United States.
We met in New York. We didn’t know each other at all. We were from
all parts of the United States. We studied in Sweden, Denmark, and
Germany in a ten-week wonderful, wonderful experience. In fact, that
group still gets together. There are thirteen living out of the fifteen, and
we just met together in July, eight of us. And we’re still studying. We
still review books. It was a marvelous experience and such a great group
of inquisitive minds, eight gentlemen and seven ladies. It was wonderful.

Wilson

What were you called?

Garber

It was called the European Study Project.

Wilson

And did they do that in other years?

Garber

No, I don’t think they have. We discussed that at our last group. In fact,
I’m writing up an article now, talking about (that was our fiftieth
reunion) how important that was to us and what it did for us and why
these kind of things still need to be done today, and that it did have a
great purpose, and it was worth the [cost]. We did have to pay a little bit
of money, but a lot of it was mostly scholarships that we got. That was a
big help to most of us in those days, to be able to go.

Wilson

So was just having the international experience part of what was so
important, just experiencing another way of life?

Garber

Yes, I mean, almost all of us had never been to Europe. We had teachers

18

from throughout the world coming and giving these seminars and these
lectures. Then we’d tour these certain areas, and the lecture would
emphasize wherever we were going to tour. Then we’d come back and
discuss it and the relevancy of that. So, yes, it was an enlightening
experience and also opened you up to the fact that people across the
world are just—the diversity of people, learning to accept people at all
levels. Learning to engage in other discussions is just something I
always recommend to students. If you can study abroad for a semester,
do it.
Wilson

I feel like there’s a bigger push now for that, but there are still a lot of
people that wonder why they should take the time to do something like
this. They aren’t sure they understand the implications, so it’s great to
hear you say what an impact that’s had.

Garber

It’s very positive, and I’ve always encouraged people to do that. It’s an
eye-opener. If you just stay in a small area your whole life, you don’t get
exposed to other people and other languages and finding out that there
are many different people that make the world go around. We need more
of that to achieve a peaceful nation.

Wilson

Definitely.

Garber

And accepting of others, so important.

Wilson

So when you returned from that, what did you do?

Garber

I started a dietetic internship at University of Chicago, and there was
another girl from Oklahoma State University at that time. I was hoping
she’d be able to come to this reunion because we’ve kept up with each
other throughout these years. She lives in Tucson, Arizona, now, but she
couldn’t. It was an internship for a year, and then you took an exam, and
then you became a dietician. I worked for a year as a dietician, and then I
went to Michigan State on a fellowship to get my master’s in nutrition.
That’s where I met my husband, so that’s changed my life.

Wilson

And you currently live in…

Garber

In South Bend, Indiana.

Wilson

Have you been there since then?

Garber

Since 1967 in South Bend, yes. We both are now retired, so we travel a
lot and so forth.

Wilson

So have you been back to OSU many times since 1961?

19

Garber

I have been back to Stillwater, and I have walked on the campus several
times, but I haven’t been here during Homecoming since I left. During
the year when you’re a schoolteacher or you’re working, (and my
husband was teaching, also) you can’t always get back here during these
kind of weekends, so this is my first time to be back to Homecoming
since fall of 1960.

Wilson

It’s going to be fun! (Laughter) I’m sure you’ve noticed a few changes
around campus, probably, since the last time you were here.

Garber

Yes, yes, yes, oh, yes. I’m looking forward to the golf cart tour because
that should be good, too.

Wilson

Well, do you have any advice to give to OSU students today or students
thinking about attending OSU?

Garber

Well, follow your passion. We have a wonderful daughter that excelled
in school. When she was ready to choose a college and ready to choose a
major, my advice to her was to follow your passion. Major in what you
like best, and things will work out. So she has two degrees: (I’m
diverting here just to tell you why it’s important to follow your passion)
a degree in English and a degree in cello performance. Now she’s
actually in the IT world, but it’s because of her English skills and all her
music theory that she’s able to do that. She’s a very happy person. She
still does music on the side.
I think if you’re just going for a job because you think it pays well or it’s
popular, you have to really follow what you want to do. If you want to
be an engineer or something like this, OSU has an excellent School of
Engineering. There are, of course, different areas that schools excel in,
but I think a basic bachelor’s degree that allows you to critically analyze,
think, write, learning to write—I know people use computers today, but
you’ve still got to be able to write. I would say that it’s a good place, and
you will get a good education, but you also have to put yourself into it.
People don’t give you something. You have to get yourself totally
involved, and don’t be afraid to raise your hand and say, “I will do that.”

Wilson

That’s great advice.

Garber

So that’s my advice to any student thinking about college. You may not
know what you want to major in your freshman year. Maybe you’ll just
be taking basic courses. I mean, some students do that. I was just one of
those ones that knew. I think I was too straightforward, and I should’ve
diversed a little bit, but that’s what happened.

20

Wilson

And you would encourage students to pursue an international
experience, if possible?

Garber

I would say if you can study a term abroad, don’t be afraid to go. Do it.
Absolutely. I think those programs open up a whole new avenue for
people. If you want to broaden your horizons and make this world a
better place, I think they really are there to help. I know OSU has some
wonderful programs.

Wilson

Well, is there anything that we haven’t covered that you’d like to talk
about?

Garber

No. I appreciate you very much, Latasha. What is your major by the
way?

Wilson

I got my master’s in international studies.

Garber

Okay, good for you! So you have been abroad, I take it?

Wilson

I have.

Garber

And would you agree with me?

Wilson

I would, very much. Yes, I think it does benefit every student that can
have that experience, so hopefully we can get more people doing that.

Garber

Yes. My husband and I were fortunate that in 1985 to ’87, we lived in
Malaysia, and one of the best experiences in our lives. He was associated
with the university there, and I worked as a counselor on the campus.
That was a second thought. I mean, I didn’t go there with a job. When I
got there, then they found this job. Our daughter got to go to an
international school. That was such an eye-opening experience to be
engaged in another country and live there and follow their routine. You
can’t walk in there thinking that you’re in the United States. You have to
learn how, as you know, to respect the country in which you live and to
follow their rules and to adjust accordingly. It was an amazing,
wonderful experience. I would advise anyone that can, do that. If you
can live abroad for a year, do it.

Wilson

Well, thank you very much for visiting with me today.

Garber

Thank you, thank you.
