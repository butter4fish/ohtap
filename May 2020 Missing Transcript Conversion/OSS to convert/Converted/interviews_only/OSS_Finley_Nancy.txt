Nancy Finley
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Jerry Gill
November 22, 2010
Stillwater, Oklahoma
Gill

My name is Jerry Gill. Today is November 22, 2010. I am visiting with
Nancy Finley on the Oklahoma State University Campus in Stillwater,
Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-State Stories project of the
Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Nancy, I appreciate you
taking time to come and visit with us today.

Finley

Well, thank you for asking me.

Gill

I know your husband, Eddy Finley, was instrumental in helping initiate
OSU’s Spirit Rider program…

Finley

Yes.

Gill

…and I want to visit with you a little bit about that later, but first let me
ask you a little bit about your background, where you grew up, and your
early life.

Finley

I was born and raised in Lubbock, Texas. I graduated from Texas Tech
University back in the ’70s. I married Eddy in 1979. He pursued his
doctoral degree at Oklahoma State University, and that’s how we ended
up here.

Gill

When you started, you enrolled at Texas Tech in what year? The fall
of…

Finley

Oh, gosh. Let me think. It was the fall of ’67.

Gill

So you graduated from high school in 1967?

4

Finley

Yes.

Gill

Which school did you graduate from?

Finley

Coronado High School.

Gill

Any activities, things you did in high school? Do you recall?

Finley

Oh, I was a member of the Mustang Tri-Hi-Y, the spirit squad. Let’s see,
various and a sundry different clubs.

Gill

Brothers and sisters in your family?

Finley

I have one sister. She lives in Plano, Texas, and she’s about nine years
older than I am.

Gill

What did your dad do for a living?

Finley

My dad was a mechanical engineer for the government, and my mother
was a homemaker.

Gill

So, again, you met Eddy at Lubbock. Is there a story there about how
you met? There has got to surely be a good story in there somewhere.

Finley

Yes, I was a senior in nursing school when I met Eddy. I had just
finished my surgical rotation in nursing school, and my girlfriend and I
went out to have a beer at a place called Coldwater Cattle Company, and
that’s where I met Eddy. We met in November of 1978, and we were
married in July of 1979.

Gill

Didn’t take long for romance to blossom, then?

Finley

No, not long.

Gill

That’s great. Can you tell me a little bit about Eddy, his early life, where
he grew up, and kind of how he got to Tech?

Finley

Eddy grew up in a little place called Alanreed, Texas. It’s right off of I40, off of Cap Rock of Texas. It’s about sixty-seven miles southeast of
Amarillo, Texas. He went to school at McClain High School and played
basketball and football. He also rodeoed. He was a member of the PRCA
Rodeo, Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. His parents owned
around fifteen sections of land so they had a fairly large ranch there. He
went to Texas Tech at the same time that I went to Texas Tech, but we
kind of went in different circles. I didn’t date cowboys. I was in a
sorority, and I basically dated fraternity guys and football players.

5

(Laughter) We found out later that we knew a lot of the same people.
I’m sure our paths crossed, but we never paid much attention. I probably
never paid much attention. Eddy got his master’s and his bachelor’s
from Texas Tech, and then he got his doctorate in ag ed from Oklahoma
State.
Gill

What was his major there at Tech?

Finley

Agricultural education.

Gill

What about yourself? Were you in nursing school?

Finley

I was in nursing school at Texas Tech through…

Gill

Is that like a two-plus-two program? How does that work?

Finley

Well, we didn’t have a regular baccalaureate program back then so it
was Texas Tech Methodist Hospital School, a nursing four-year
program.

Gill

A BS degree program.

Finley

Yes, it was a combination. The year after I graduated was the year they
got the baccalaureate program at Tech, but we were still considered Tech
graduates.

Gill

You’re a registered nurse?

Finley

Yes, I’m a registered nurse.

Gill

Eddy obviously had a passion for horses and ranching from the get-go. I
mean, wow!

Finley

Yes, he went to Texas Tech on a rodeo scholarship. He was a header, a
roper, and a saddle bronc rider.

Gill

He didn’t bulldog, huh?

Finley

No, no bulldogging. (Laughter)

Gill

That’s good. What about student organizations Eddy was involved in, do
you recall, when he was at Tech?

Finley

He was a member of the Rodeo Association. He was a member of
various and a sundry agricultural associations. Eddy was involved in
about everything. He was just one of those go-getters.

6

Gill

So, now, you were in a sorority. Which sorority were you in?

Finley

I was in Phi Mu. Eddy was not in a fraternity.

Gill

Your activities in college?

Finley

Oh, well, probably the same thing the kids do nowadays. I remember the
Homecoming Committee.

Gill

Did you get to pomp and do all that good stuff?

Finley

No, I didn’t do any of the pom stuff. I wasn’t a member of the pom
squad. (Laughs)

Gill

No, the pomping. Putting it in the…

Finley

Oh, yes. All the little tissue paper?

Gill

Yes.

Finley

Yes, I got to do that. (Laughter) Our homecoming wasn’t quite as
grandiose as Oklahoma State’s, but it was good.

Gill

So, again, what year did Eddy graduate with his bachelor’s degree?

Finley

Let’s see. Eddy graduated with his bachelor’s degree in 1971. He
graduated with his master’s degree in 1973, and then he went to
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, for about four years and was chief consultant to
the crown prince on agricultural affairs. He had just gotten back to the
United States when I met him. He was telling me he was going to go get
his doctorate, and I thought, “Okay.” (Laughs) He kept telling me that. I
finally asked him, I said, “Why are you telling me that? You’ve already
told me about twelve times,” and he said, “Well, I just wanted you to
know that after we’re married, that’s what we’re going to be doing.”
(Laughter) This was about fifteen minutes after I met him, and I thought,
“Okay.” (Laughter)

Gill

Did you check and see how long he’d been there?

Finley

Well, I thought perhaps I might have married Norman Bates, the psycho,
or met him or whatnot. (Laughter)

Gill

Let me back up. This is something I didn’t know about Eddy. After he
finished his master’s degree, which was in agricultural education, as
well, then he went to Bahrain?

7

Finley

Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

Gill

For four years?

Finley

Yes.

Gill

Wow. Some of his activities there, do you recall? Did he tell you about
it?

Finley

Well, mostly he was a consultant for agricultural matters over there,
what they could grow as far as crops, and basically just consulted with
the crown prince. I don’t know. There are several crown princes in the
Saudi Arabian dynasty. Basically just worked with him off and on,
would come back to the States in intervals and whatnot. But, yes, he
worked over there for a while.

Gill

Kind of back to Texas Tech. If you’d grown up at Tech and gone to some
games, you’d have seen the Masked Rider even before you were in
college, right?

Finley

You bet.

Gill

Do you remember what some of your first memories were, or your
thoughts about the Masked Rider?

Finley

Probably when I was a sophomore in high school, some of our good
friends had a son that went to Texas A&M who was in the corps. We
were playing Texas A&M, and so he asked me to go to the game with
him. I think I was maybe fifteen and he was twenty-some-odd. We had
been lifelong friends, our parents had, so I went to the game with him.
The first time I saw the Masked Rider I thought it was really neat. Of
course, we grew up with that tradition, but just basically going to see the
horse. Yes, it was really pretty. The horse at the time was called
Charcoal Cody. There’s a track that goes around the football field of
Texas Tech where the horse runs so the horse never goes out on the
field.

Gill

The Masked Rider, of course, I guess is the official mascot for Texas
Tech. What does he symbolize for Texas Tech people?

Finley

Well, it’s kind of like the Spirit Rider in that part of the country because
Lubbock is really built on land called Llano Estacado, because that part
of Texas was part of Mexico at one time. It’s just kind of a
symbolization between the Spanish heritage and the American heritage.
Texas Tech—I don’t know if you’ve ever been on their campus, but

8

many of their buildings are in the Spanish format, the engineering
buildings, the mathematical buildings, and they have kept that tradition
all these years. So the Masked Rider symbolizes kind of like a Zorrotype. If you looked at the Masked Rider and didn’t really know what the
Masked Rider was, you would think it was Zorro because they do wear
the cape, they do wear the bolero hat, and they have the mask and
whatnot and are on a solid black horse.
Gill

Thank you. We’ll come back to the Masked Rider later, in just a couple
minutes. After Eddy came back, you met him after he’d come back from
Saudi Arabia.

Finley

Yes, he was back about six months when I met him.

Gill

Then you got married a few months after that. Can you kind of trace
your career before you came to Oklahoma State, and after that?

Finley

After we got married?

Gill

Yes. After you got married was there a time in there before you came to
OSU?

Finley

Well, I was still living in Lubbock because I was working at Methodist
Hospital. Eddy had been teaching at Roosevelt High School, about
eleven miles south of Lubbock. After the end of his teaching there, he
moved back to the ranch to help his parents out a little bit before we
came to school. At the time, Eddy really didn’t know where he was
going to go to school. He had applied at nine graduate schools and been
accepted by all nine so we were kind of trying to figure out where we
wanted to go. The first place that we were going to go was Fort Collins,
but unfortunately I couldn’t get a job in Colorado because nobody likes
to leave Colorado. Everybody that graduates likes to stay there so we
ended up coming to Oklahoma State. Eddy moved back to the ranch. We
were married July 14, 1979. He came up from the ranch, and we were
married that weekend. Had about a two-day honeymoon, he went back
to the ranch, and I stayed in Lubbock and worked. Then, on my days off,
I would drive to the ranch. It was about a three-hour drive from Alanreed
to Lubbock. We did that until he was accepted to OSU, and we came
here.

Gill

Was that in 1980?

Finley

No, that was 1979. Yes, September of ’79.

Gill

So you had opportunities to go to several different graduate programs.
Was there a reason that he was influenced to come to Oklahoma State?

9

Finley

Well, actually, when we found out, we were sitting in a Denny’s in Fort
Collins, Colorado. (Laughs) I was telling him that I could work per
diem, or part-time, as a nurse. Of course, with my husband being in
graduate school I needed full-time employment. He said that Oklahoma
State had presented an interest in him to come and work on his doctoral
studies there. So here we are, and he said, “Why don’t we just drive to
Stillwater?” We got in our car, and we drove all day and part of the
evening, and got into Stillwater and met with Dr. Robert Terry later on
that afternoon of the next day when we arrived. He offered Eddy a
graduate assistantship. One of the reasons why Eddy was accepted is
from the time they actually were recording grades, keeping grades, he
only made one B in the whole time.

Gill

Wow.

Finley

Very, very intelligent man, but you wouldn’t know it. Very down to
earth man.

Gill

Was Dr. Terry the chairman of his education committee?

Finley

Yes, Robert Terry was head of the department at the time, of Ag Ed, and
kind of his confidant. Dr. Robert Price was really more of a mentor to
Eddy than anyone.

Gill

How long before he finished his doctoral program?

Finley

He started in September of 1979, and he graduated in May of 1981.

Gill

That’s pretty quick.

Finley

Yes, and then we moved back to Texas. We moved to Vernon, Texas. I
told him one of the stipulations of him coming to Oklahoma is that we
had to go back home to Texas when he finished. (Laughter) I didn’t want
to live in Oklahoma, didn’t like Oklahoma. I mean, I was born and
raised in Texas, as well as he was.

Gill

Specifically, west Texas.

Finley

Yes, we moved to Vernon, Texas, for about fourteen months. He was the
head of the junior college Ag Ed Department and the rodeo advisor.
Then our daughter J. J., or Jessica, was born in Vernon. When she was
about four months old in October of 1982, we moved back to Stillwater.

Gill

He got a position, then, on the faculty?

10

Finley

They offered him an assistant professorship. From there, he just kind of
gradually went up the ladder.

Gill

During these periods, were you working in nursing?

Finley

Kind of off and on. I started, basically, back to work in 1984, about four
months after Justin was born, at the Student Health Center.

Gill

So you moved back, then, to Stillwater. What year would that have been
in? Eighty-two?

Finley

October of ’82 is when we moved back.

Gill

Then you worked at the…

Finley

I didn’t start working. I kind of worked off and on at different per diem
jobs, just fill-ins and things, because we had a new baby and I was
staying home. Then I became pregnant with our son, Justin. Basically
started back to work full-time in April of 1984.

Gill

And you were working here at the university?

Finley

I was working at the university as a staff nurse. Then in 1992 I became
the Assistant Director of Nurses.

Gill

And Donald “Doc” Cooper was the head.

Finley

Yes.

Gill

Have you got some good Doc Cooper stories that you can tell?
(Laughter)

Finley

Oh, yes. (Laughs) I worked for Dr. Cooper for a while.

Gill

Do you remember when Eddy started first thinking about the Spirit
Rider concept?

Finley

It was in—let’s see. It was in May of ’84 because the Spirit Rider, which
many people don’t know, is really the mascot for the band. The band
wanted a mascot, and so William Ballenger, who I think is now the band
director at Texas Tech, was at OSU at the time. He and another
gentleman in the band department called Eddy, knowing that Eddy had
gone to Texas Tech and that we had a rider, a Spirit Rider-type, the
Masked Rider, and asked him if he would consider maybe coming
together and talking about getting a mascot for the band. At that time,
Eddy was doing a lot of traveling because one of his jobs was to certify

11

first-year ag teachers in the state of Oklahoma so he was doing quite a
bit of traveling. He said he would think about it. He came home, and we
talked about it. He said, “This is what I kind of thought we might do. I
want to see what you think.” He talked about the similarities between the
Red Raider and something similar for OSU.
Gill

So he was influenced by the Masked Rider?

Finley

Yes. Mostly what he was influenced by was the horse aspect because of
being raised on a horse and cattle ranch, because he was a member of the
PRCA Rodeo Association, and because he had worked with horses all of
his life. He wanted to kind of bring that influence since Oklahoma A&M
was a state-supported school and there was agricultural influence here.
He thought that we would bring something because you already had
Pistol Pete so he thought he would bring something similar to what
Texas Tech had. He talked about it. We thought about it. We went over a
lot of different scenarios, and finally he asked me what I thought about
maybe having a guy on a horse that just rode out on the field carrying
the OSU flag, dressed like a working cowboy. I told him I thought that
would be really good. I also told him, I said, “If you’re going to have
that happen, then it has to be a real cowboy. It can’t be somebody that
just wears boots and a hat. They have to have a ranching and farming
background.” He agreed with that.
His first person that came to mind to be the first Spirit Rider is John
Beall. John Beall and Eddy were good friends. He was John’s advisor.
Also, John was the president of the Rodeo Association. Eddy had been
asked to take over the club because the kids were really wanting to
resurrect the Rodeo Association. In the first year and second year, (I
think it was the first and second year, it may have been the first and third
year) Eddy brought them from the very bottom of the clubs at Oklahoma
State to the very top. They won top club in the College of Ag. Whatever
Eddy did, he didn’t do on the spur of the moment. Whatever he did, he
put a lot of thought process into it. He thought about it. He planned it
out. He mapped it out. He committed to nothing until he had everything
completely organized. Fortunately, he wasn’t that way at home,
(Laughter) but about his students, his studies, the Spirit Rider, the Rodeo
Association, anything that he was asked to tackle took great thought and
planning. He just never did anything by the spur of the moment.

Gill

To your knowledge, did Eddy or anyone else visit with Texas Tech about
the Spirit Rider program at OSU?

Finley

No.

Gill

Did Texas Tech ever have any issues with OSU creating a similar kind

12

of, but slightly different, mascot?
Finley

No, not really because Wyoming also has a—of course, they have a
Shetland pony, but they are the Wyoming Cowboys. They have their
cowboys run out with the little horse and stuff. When the program first
started, it was Eddy, John Beall, his horse Della, and then Hooker was
John Beall’s little cow dog, little cattle dog. He was a little blue heeler.
He came to all the games and sat on the sideline because when John got
ready to run out onto the field, he would tell Hooker to stay. One time,
he forgot to tell Hooker to stay, and so Hooker ran out on the field with
him, and everybody loved it. For a couple of years after John had
graduated and we had new Spirit Riders, everybody wanted to know
where the little dog was.

Gill

What happened to the dog, huh? (Laughter)

Finley

Yes, Hooker became very, very popular. The boys rode their own horses
up until—the last thing Eddy did before he turned over the reins of the
Spirit Rider to Don Topliff was to find a horse for OSU. What he was
looking for was a very gentle horse that children could come up and pet,
pull the tail, just do whatever, and the horse would not kick, that was not
frightful of the crowds, because they used to have to stuff cotton in the
ears of the horse because it was so loud out on the field. Sometimes it
would spook the horse, especially Penny, who was the Bailey boys’,
who was Brad, Kenny, and Steve Bailey. This was a concept that he took
just a little bit of what Tech had to offer and kind of made it his own. He
was very precise. There was no Spirit Rider corps at that time. There
was no trailer. No pickup was donated. Everybody had their own thing.
What we were basically looking for was just a mascot that the band
would be happy with, that the tradition could carry on.

Gill

Let me come back and ask you a couple of questions about that. If I
understood right, the band, did they come to Eddy?

Finley

No, the director of the band came to Eddy.

Gill

Bill Ballenger.

Finley

He called Eddy, and there was another gentleman, too. I think his last
name started with an S, but I don’t think he was in the picture much, but
basically Bill Ballenger. Then on down the line, Myron Roderick and
Dave Martin worked with Ed, also.

Gill

You alluded to a couple of things. First of all, the horse and the Spirit
Rider: who came up with the term Spirit Rider?

13

Finley

Eddy.

Gill

It was Eddy’s? He came up with the term?

Finley

Yes.

Gill

Of course, the Masked Rider is the rider, but what were his thoughts on
the Spirit part of it?

Finley

Just the spirit of OSU, and you had an experienced rider. He thought
Spirit Rider was kind of a catchy name that people could remember.
(Laughs)

Gill

Do you remember some other names he was thinking about as he came
up with that?

Finley

No, he really wasn’t thinking of any because, again, when Eddy was
asked to do something, or there was a plan or whatnot, he thought about
it for a long period of time. When he came up with Spirit Rider that was
what it was going to be.

Gill

You alluded earlier to the fact, of course, OSU already has a mascot:
Pistol Pete. Why did Eddy and others feel that they needed a Spirit Rider
in addition to Pistol Pete?

Finley

I think that the band just always felt like they needed something to kind
of define who they were. They wanted something to make them stand
out and, probably, to this day because the Spirit Rider started in 1984,
and now we’re in 2010, so we are looking at twenty-six years. I doubt
very seriously if you were not involved at that time with the Spirit Rider
that you would not realize that that Spirit Rider is the band’s mascot.

Gill

Is it still that way today?

Finley

Well, it was, as long as my husband was in charge of it. Whether it is, I
don’t have a lot to do with that anymore.

Gill

Nancy, you were talking a little bit about the riders. First, you had John
Beall.

Finley

There was John Beall, then Raymond Russ, then Brad Bailey, Kenny
Bailey, and Todd Honer.

Gill

These are the ones that worked under Eddy?

Finley

Under Eddy. As time went on, one of the things that he always did that

14

we always thought was nice, these pictures hung in Ag Hall for a long
time. Now they’re at my house packed away, but the boys each got a
picture. Eddy always had a professional picture made of the boys on
their horse, either in front of Ag Hall, the Seretean Center, or the An Sci
[Animal Science] Arena. I’m trying to think where else. I think those
were the only places, maybe in front of the library, carrying the flag and
dressed in their regalia, and had a little nameplate underneath their name
saying their name, what year they were the Spirit Rider, and then my
husband’s name and that he was the advisor. Eddy was the advisor of the
Spirit Rider Association from 1984 to 1989.
Gill

Do you remember some of the ones that followed him? You mentioned
Don Topliff.

Finley

Don Topliff was a good friend of Eddy’s and took over the program
when Eddy decided he had done it long enough and wanted to turn the
reins over. It was pretty fortunate because not long after he turned over
the reins of it, my husband became ill. Don Topliff, David Freeman, and
that’s really all I can remember, at that time. After Eddy became ill, I
didn’t have much to do with the football program or didn’t go to many
football games.

Gill

You were mentioning something about being involved. Do you recall, in
the process, who were some of the decision makers? You mentioned Bill
Ballenger. Was Gerald Frank—was that the other person that you were
thinking about?

Finley

Yes, that name sounds familiar.

Gill

You mentioned Myron Roderick, who was the athletic director.

Finley

Yes.

Gill

Were those the decision makers involved when they actually…

Finley

The decision for what the mascot was going to be was all Eddy’s.

Gill

Okay.

Finley

They asked him to come up with a mascot. He came up with one. He
presented it to them. They all thought it was pretty good. In September
of 1984, myself, Eddy, John, Della, and Hooker were the only ones out
there on the field. When OSU scored their first touchdown, John ran out
full blast on the field with the flag flying. At that time, they could run
from end zone to end zone. People just went crazy. I mean, they just
loved it. A lot of people wrote in saying it was great. As the program

15

built, then Eddy started putting together a Spirit Rider corps. From what
I can see when I go to the games now, not much of that has changed too
much from the way that Eddy did it. There are girl riders now. I think
most of the Spirit Corps right now are girls. I haven’t seen too many
guys. He got Tener’s to donate the outfits that the Spirit Corps and the
rider [wear]. One of his good friends in Tulsa tooled the saddle for
Bullet, and the reins. He had another good friend in Chickasha at
Stidham Trailers that donated the first Spirit Rider trailer.
Gill

Do you know what year that was?

Finley

Let me think. I believe that was 1986. Ron Shirley also donated a pickup
truck because Eddy was using his truck to pull the trailer, so a lot of
things were donated. The program grew and grew, and then the process
of picking a new Spirit Rider every year was pretty tedious. I mean, they
had to have a farm and ranching background. I believe Eddy did an oral
examination of them, watched how they rode, how they handled their
horses, just to make sure that they really could ride.

Gill

Talking about the horse, going back to Bullet, can we talk about Bullet?
First of all, there was no Bullet, by name, for the first three or four
years. When did they first name the horse Bullet, and do you remember
what year that was?

Finley

It was right before Eddy decided not to be the advisor anymore. It was
1989. He and Raymond Russ, Rusty Russ’ father, (Rusty was the second
Spirit Rider) were out looking for a horse. Right outside of Chandler
they found a horse. (Laughter) Eddy said that was the ugliest horse he’d
ever seen, but all dolled up he’d look pretty good. Gentle horse, sweet
horse. Had been, I think, the children’s horse of these people. So for
$500 and season tickets, Bullet was purchased. Only Bullet wasn’t
named Bullet at the time. Bullet was named Possum.

Gill

Possum! (Laughs)

Finley

The horse’s name was Possum. Ed told me, “We can’t have a horse
running out onto the field by the name of Possum,” (Laughter) so he got
together with some gentlemen and decided that they were going to have
a campus-wide naming contest for the new Spirit Rider horse. The
students picked Bullet, and that’s how Bullet got his name.

Gill

Just trivia, but you wouldn’t happen to remember the name of the
student who won the contest, would you?

Finley

No, I wouldn’t. I don’t know who won it. I’m sure it was published, but
I don’t know who won it. Eddy would always say, “There’s a $500 horse

16

with a $10,000 tack,” because the saddle was beautiful. The bits were
beautiful, and all fixed up, Bullet was a gorgeous horse. I always thought
Bullet was pretty, period, but I’m not a very good judge of horses...
Gill

Now, Possum was black. They were looking for a black quarter horse.
Isn’t that right?

Finley

Yes, his name was Possum.

Gill

By my understanding, visiting with the Cunninghams, with Ty, it’s not
that easy to find an all-black quarter horse. They are not bred very
much anymore. It was interesting.

Finley

Bullet was more of a deep, deep brown color than a black color, but all
shined up, prettied up, and dressed up, Bullet looked pretty good. The
original Bullet was an extremely sweet horse, just a very gentle horse.

Gill

Back to your comments about the tack and saddle and how it evolved
because it’s fairly elaborate, can you describe that first year or two
when you had John Beall and Rusty? Those first couple of years, what
was their tack, their saddle, and their apparel like?

Finley

Well, they had their own saddles. They had their own saddles because
they had their own horses.

Gill

Just regular rodeo saddles?

Finley

Yes. They wore jeans, chaps, white shirts, a vest, kind of a light orange
vest with “OSU” on it, and black hats, and carried an OSU flag.

Gill

How has that changed or evolved, the apparel, over the years?

Finley

Well, they’re more into black now.

Gill

The shirts.

Finley

Well, they’ve got white shirts, but everything else is mostly black.

Gill

Black jeans and black chaps, etcetera.

Finley

Yes. When the Spirit Rider first started, Eddy didn’t want to put a lot
into it until he wanted to see how it was going to catch on. I think even
he was kind of surprised how it caught on. One of his very, very good
friends, Jim Hamilton—the statue that sits out in front of Gallagher Iba
—the university wanted a statue made of Bullet, or made of the horse
and the Spirit Rider. We didn’t have Bullet then. The rider that sits on

17

top of that horse out there is actually fashioned after John Beall and
Della, the first Spirit Rider. Eddy and Jim drew the design. Jim molded
it, and then the casting for that statue out there was from a foundry in
Lubbock. It was poured in Lubbock and transported here.
Gill

That first year when you said you weren’t sure how it would catch on,
was it sort of a trial year, or a “let’s see how it works” attitude?

Finley

Yes, it was kind of a trial. Well, you had Pistol Pete, who is really the
iconic figure for OSU, and you had to be careful not to step on anyone’s
toes because, again, you’re coming in with something new. You didn’t
want people to think that you were trying to replace Pistol Pete with the
Spirit Rider so what Eddy did, he was very careful in the way that he
presented the Spirit Rider versus Pistol Pete. He didn’t run out there and
try and overshadow Pete. It was after the touchdowns that the horse
came out.

Gill

From the get-go, from the very first year in ’84, they would actually run
out on the field after the touchdowns and the field goals?

Finley

Not the field goals, just the touchdowns, and they had the full field. They
ran from goal line to goal line.

Gill

Which is what the Masked Rider does at Texas Tech. Isn’t that correct?

Finley

Yes, but around the field at Tech is an oval track, and the horse runs
around that track so it’s never out on the field. The reason the horse only
goes out to about the twenty yard line now is because when Kenny
Bailey, who was the fourth Spirit Rider—we had scored a touchdown,
and OSU used to have this huge drum that they would pull out on the
field. The Bailey boys (again, Brad, Kenney and Steve, now, Steve was
not a Spirit Rider under Eddy, but Brad and Kenny were) rode their
horse. She was a quarter horse. Her name was Penny. She was an allblack horse, very beautiful horse, but very, very highly strung. Anyway,
Kenny is getting ready to ride out onto the field, and they pulled this
drum out, and the ref came around the other side of the drum and ran
into the horse, and it knocked him down.
He got really angry, and he said the horse knocked him down, which, in
fact, it didn’t. He actually ran into the horse. Well, after much
negotiations, Eddy said that he would take the Spirit Rider off of the
field if they didn’t get rid of that drum. He used some adjectives there,
but he hated the drum. He thought it was a very big deterrent. He
thought it was really a hazard out there with the horse because you’re
dealing with over 50,000 people, you’re dealing with people out on the
field, you’re dealing with the drum, you’re dealing with Pistol Pete,

18

you’re dealing with cheerleaders, pom girls, so you have to be careful.
That’s why he was very, very careful about the safety of everybody. He
felt like…
Gill

That’s a very unnatural act for a horse to run out on a field with 50,000
screaming fans, isn’t it?

Finley

Well, that’s why Penny always had cotton in her ears, so she couldn’t
hear. (Laughter)

Gill

So John Beall, the Bailey boys, and Rusty, they all rode their own horses
for those first four or five years, then?

Finley

Yes, Todd Honer didn’t have a horse of his own, so he rode Penny.

Gill

That was the Bailey boys’ horse?

Finley

Yes, the Baileys had Penny. She rode every year that they rode. I don’t
know about Steve. I don’t know if he rode Bullet or not because, again,
when Eddy quit being advisor and really gave up the program, then I
really quit going to the games and really didn’t pay that much attention
to it.

Gill

Nancy, again, pretty high-strung horses we’ve been talking about and
all the distractions, etcetera. Did they do some pre-work with the horses
to prepare them? Did they just bring them in and run them around the
field, or did they practice in advance some? Did they get used to music
or anything?

Finley

No, not really because—they put cotton in their ears. But you have to
understand these were the boys’ horses. These were horses that were
roping horses, that were their rodeo horses, so these boys could handle
their own horses.

Gill

These horses had been in parades and rodeo events…

Finley

Well, they had been in rodeo events. Della was John’s. Rusty had his
horse. Penny was the Bailey boys’ horse. I mean, they could handle their
horse so it wasn’t like you had a rider that could not handle the horse.
That’s why it was very important for them to have a farming and ranch
background, because they had to know how to handle the horse. That’s
why Eddy was very adamant about getting a horse that was going to be
able to be ridden by anyone. If a child should run up behind the horse,
that the horse wouldn’t kick the child in the head. If somebody came up
and wanted to pull the mane of the horse or the tail of the horse, the
horse wasn’t going to be fidgety. The first Bullet was like that, very,

19

very sweet, docile horse, just kind of laid back, loved to run out on the
field, so that’s what he was looking for.
Gill

What can you tell me about, talking about that first one, John? It’s
pronounced Bell, but it’s…

Finley

Beall, B-E-A-L-L.

Gill

Tell me about John, his personality a little bit. Being the first Spirit
Rider, we’ve got to know a little bit more about him, his personality,
where he grew up, what he did, some things you know about him.

Finley

John was cute, cocky, a great guy. We loved him to death, pretty full of
himself. His father was an equine vet in Norman and worked on a lot of
show horses and whatnot. John had been around horses all his life,
excellent horseman, I mean, could really ride. Adored my husband,
thought he was wonderful and worked very closely with Eddy. The years
that the rodeo club got up and going, he became president of the Rodeo
Association, and, really, the transformation of John from a really cocky,
young eighteen-, nineteen-, twenty-year-old guy to a very mature person
by the time he graduated was in large part due to Eddy. Eddy loved his
students. He loved teaching. He loved doing what he was doing, but he
was a disciplinarian. “You do it my way,” or you didn’t do it at all,
because his way was a way that was thought out very carefully.
Most people think that on game day, you get on the horse, you score a
touchdown, out goes the horse, and then out comes the—there’s a lot of
planning that goes into that. I don’t know Ty real well, but from what I
can tell, not too much of it has changed from the time it was first started.
I don’t know how they pick their Spirit Riders now. Tony Payne is a
good friend of mine, and John Martin, they co-wrote the “Cowboys
Forever” song. When they were doing the filming of Bullet riding in the
range and whatnot, I was out there with them when they were doing that
because one of my good friends is Jamie Payne, Tony’s wife. There’s
been some changes, of course, because we’re talking about a program
that’s been going twenty-six years. You would expect some changes, but
there hasn’t been dramatic change to the program. Probably, the most
dramatic change is that most of the Spirit Riders of late have been girls,
and that’s fine.

Gill

How would Eddy have felt about that? (Laughter) Was he more of a
traditional guy?

Finley

My husband was very traditional, very traditional. (Laughter) It’s not
that he was chauvinistic at all. If he ever had a female that could’ve
ridden the way those guys did, which I’m sure there were plenty of them

20

around, but, again, this was at the very beginning of the program. This
was in the ’80s. This was when this program first started. He was not
comfortable with putting a female on the horse. Now, if he were alive
today, if he were choosing today, I would venture to say he would
probably have chosen a female, but back in the day, he wouldn’t have
felt comfortable with it.
Gill

Also, it seems like when you think about John and Rusty and the Bailey
boys, they all knew each other, all on the rodeo team and together, so
the first four or five years it was sort of like one buddy handed it to the
next buddy.

Finley

Yes, kind of, but it was opened up. Applications were taken, and there
was a committee that looked at the applications.

Gill

They still had the pretty strict application process even those first three
or four years?

Finley

Yes, oh, yes. As long as my husband was the advisor, that’s how it went.
Applications were taken. The applications were reviewed, like with any
job. The most qualified candidates were the ones that they reinterviewed. It just so happened the most qualified applicants were all
rodeo boys. These were boys that were out there on saddle broncs or
bareback, or bull riders, or ropers, and that’s what you wanted when you
put somebody out on that field.

Gill

Particularly those first two or three years when you’re trying to be sure
nothing goes wrong and things are right with the program.

Finley

Eddy didn’t want, first of all, anybody to be injured so that was his main
concern, the fans. As the program progressed year to year and as it
became more and more popular, everybody wanted their picture with the
horse. Everybody wanted their picture with the Spirit Rider. They were
really in demand to do this, that, and the other, go to this function and
that function, and Eddy did take the horse to El Paso. It was when Todd
Honer was the Spirit Rider so that had to be in ’88.

Gill

Is that the Sun Bowl Game?

Finley

Yes, that’s when we had that big Ice Bowl. (Laughter) He got stuck
there. He was with another professor, one of his good friends, James
White, who was also in the Ag Ed Department. James went with him. He
called me and said, “Boy, the weather’s gorgeous here.” He said, “Not a
bit of forecast. Looks like they just made a mistake.” The next day they
dubbed it the Ice Bowl. (Laughter) That was the only time he took the
horse.

21

Gill

Picking up on that, today they will make a few other appearances at
different places, but then, those first four or five years, other than home
OSU football games and the one event in El Paso, did they tend to
participate in the ’89er Parade in Guthrie or anywhere else at all?

Finley

No.

Gill

Were there requests, as you indicated formerly, to…

Finley

There were some requests, but Eddy didn’t, he didn’t want to do it. He
just felt like it caused—well, been a lot of trouble. He would take the
horse off the field in the fourth quarter with about three minutes left in
the game, three to four minutes, to take the horse back to the An Sci
Arena to avoid all the traffic and whatnot, people trying to come up and
pet the horse and do all of that.

Gill

One other question that comes to mind is that first group, especially,
and it has kind of continued today, one year per Spirit Rider. For Pistol
Petes they’ll normally do two, maybe one, but normally a couple of
years. Was it decided that one year would be…

Finley

It was usually a senior. I don’t know if it’s still that way, but when Eddy
was the advisor it was a senior.

Gill

Did they talk about, “We really want them for just one year and turn it
over to somebody else”?

Finley

No, I don’t really—when he decided that, John was a senior. Rusty was
a senior. All the boys were a senior under Eddy. Then they graduated. I
don’t know if that tradition is still the same. I think it is because it seems
like there’s a different Spirit Rider every year.

Gill

We talked about pulling Bullet off the field early during games. Where
did they keep Bullet when he wasn’t performing at the ballgames?

Finley

Well, it was kept at the An Sci Arena.

Gill

Animal Science Arena.

Finley

Yes, in the stables over there. That’s where Bullet was.

Gill

Somebody was assigned to take care of Bullet?

Finley

Yes.

22

Gill

Was that usually the Spirit Rider?

Finley

No, the Corps boys would go over and check on Bullet, but it was
usually who was at the stable.

Gill

It was whoever was working?

Finley

Yes, to make sure the horse was fed and taken care of. Bullet was a
highly pampered horse.

Gill

Did Eddy help any with the training of the horses?

Finley

No.

Gill

Just up to their owner?

Finley

Yes. These horses were the boys’ horses. They were used to the boys,
and the boys were used to them. These were their roping rodeo horses,
their horses they rode all the time. There really wasn’t any training per
se. I guess if you don’t have that, that farming ranching background, you
don’t really understand that there really wasn’t any training for Bullet
either. I mean, you were a cowboy, you had grown up on a horse, you
knew how to ride a horse, you knew how to handle a horse. That’s why
it was so imperative that when the new Spirit Rider was chosen that they
had that background.
You couldn’t take somebody that went down to the Territory and bought
a pair of boots and put a hat on and said, “I’m a cowboy,” and put them
on a horse, because if you had never ridden a horse before, you wouldn’t
be able to handle a horse and a flag. That flag is heavy. When you are
guiding your horse, or Bullet, with one rein, and you’re holding a flag up
above with one hand, you’ve got to have the experience that it takes to
ride that horse. To put someone that didn’t have that experience would
not have been a wise choice. To my knowledge (and I talked to Ty
Cunningham about this) that hasn’t changed. It’s still a farming and
ranch background with the people that ride the horses.

Gill

Let me go back and see if I understood right. When we were talking
about the incident with the official, you used to run the length of the
field. What year was that?

Finley

Oh, gosh. Let me think. What year was that? Let’s see, Kenny was the
Spirit Rider. That probably would’ve had to have been ’87-’88 year. It
really shook Kenny up because the official came up screaming and
yelling at him. The head ref actually came up to Eddy and said, “Don’t
worry about it.” They did look at the films and found out that the ref was

23

really at fault, not Kenny and not the horse. They decided right then and
there, Eddy and the head guy decided, that they’d just run out to the
twenty yard line and get the drum off the field.
Gill

They let them fudge a little and get out to the thirty or forty now, I think.

Finley

Yes, they go out just a little bit further.

Gill

How did Eddy feel about the development of the Spirit Rider program
and his role in helping it? Was it a source of pride for him?

Finley

Not really.

Gill

He didn’t feel just a little bit good about it?

Finley

Not really. You would have to know my husband. My husband was, he
was a very intelligent man. He was highly thought of by his peers and
his students. To this day, if you mention my husband’s name on campus
and those people that knew him, you will hear people say what a great
guy he was. He really was. He never looked for any kind of glory for
himself. He never liked to take credit for himself. All the credit he gave
to his students and to the boys that rode the horse, he gave to his Spirit
Rider corps. He wanted them to succeed. He gave them the foundation
for success, and then he gave them the tools to be successful, and he
guided them in that direction, but he never, never said, “Oh, yes, I
started the Spirit Rider program.”
He just was not that kind of man. In fact, the garden at Ag Hall that is
dedicated to him with the plaque, the plaque that’s on the back of the
Spirit Rider statue, Eddy would not have liked that. He was not a glory
hound. He loved what he did. He loved teaching. He loved being a
mentor. He loved being a father, a husband, a friend. He loved being all
those things, but as far as being somebody that took a great deal of pride
in his participation in anything, he was not like that. So if he were here
today and you were to ask him if he was prideful that the Spirit Rider
tradition has survived as long as it has, he would tell you it has only
survived because of the people that are behind it.

Gill

Was he proud of the program itself, though?

Finley

He was proud of the program. He was proud that his students had
recognition because it brought a lot of recognition to the College of Ag.
The boys were coming out of the College of Ag. It brought them
recognition, but as far as Eddy went, as a personal glorification, it just—
no. He didn’t seek that.

24

Gill

Looking back, what are your thoughts on the Spirit Rider program,
Nancy? How do you feel about it?

Finley

I’m very proud of the Spirit Rider program. I am very proud that it has
sustained for as long as it has. I’m very proud that when I watch that
horse run out on the field I still see my husband down there on the field.
It’s kind of a bittersweet episode for me because Eddy and I were very
good friends. We were very best friends. Everything that was decided as
a couple, we decided together. The Spirit Rider program was no
different because when the Spirit Rider program, the Rodeo Association,
and the advisorship, and the working towards being a full professor, and
working towards being a full member of the graduate college, that took
my husband away from home quite a bit. We had two young children at
the time, but it was something that we discussed. It was something that
was important to both of us, to his career, and to our family.
So when I look at the Spirit Rider now and all the accolades that it has
brought, and when Eddy passed away in May of ’96 and I was coming
down Hall of Fame and I looked over at the statue and there was a big
pile of yellow roses lying there, it made me feel pretty good because
their tradition has not changed that much. The faces have changed. The
advisors have changed, but the way the program has been run, and the
way that it is still, “Here comes Bullet!” and people just still get excited,
I take a great deal of pride in that for my husband and for all the boys
that went before, and young women that went before that.

Gill

Can you pick out some special moments, some special memories of your
and Eddy’s participation in the program through the years?

Finley

Oh, let’s see. Probably at our rodeo banquets. The boys always wanted
to do something special for Eddy. One year, they gave him a beautiful,
beautiful statue of a rider and a cowboy with a plaque that really said,
“For everything that you’ve done for us, for all you meant to us, Dr.
Finley, we appreciate you so.” That was very touching for Eddy because
he wanted them to feel like they had accomplished something, and if he
were a small part of their accomplishments, then he was happy with that.
Going out to the barn on Sundays and brushing Bullet, putting the kids
on the horse, and just our family time that we had. Not Bullet—well,
yes, Bullet. Yes, we had Bullet by then. Eddy only ran Bullet for about
one year before he gave up the program, but it was a hard decision for
him. We talked about it.
He had already accomplished—Eddy always set goals. “In this many
years, I’m going to do this. In this many years, I’m going to do that,” His
goals were, “I’m going to get tenure. I’m going to become a full
professor. I’m going to be a member of the graduate college by this time.

25

The Spirit Rider program is off to a good enough start that someone else
can pick it up and go with it. If they want to change it, whatever they
want to do with it, it’s their thing,” because once he was finished with
something, he was done. He didn’t advise anymore. He didn’t give any
kind of pep talk to the new person. He didn’t tell them how they should
run their program, because then it was their program. So the moments
that I think we had with our family.
It was a source of pride to Eddy that the program was doing as well, but
was it a source of personal pride to him? No. It was a source of pride
that the right guys rode the right horses at the right time and that the
public had accepted the Spirit Rider. As far as Texas Tech goes, they’ve
never said a single thing about, “Well, you tried to take the mascot away
from Tech,” because they’re really two different things. They both run
out after the touchdowns. The Masked Rider runs out after the field
goals. The horse doesn’t. They aren’t dressed the same way. The horses
aren’t the same color. The Masked Rider’s horses used to come from a
place called Post, Texas, and they were all quarter horses, black, pure
black horses. The first Bullet wasn’t very pretty to look at. I thought he
was beautiful, but Eddy said he was ugly. (Laughter)
Gill

He would know.

Finley

Yes, he would know. I said, “This is the most gorgeous horse.” He goes,
“This is the ugliest horse I’ve ever seen, Nancy, but he’s sweet,” and he
said, “That’s what I’m looking for.”

Gill

Nancy, I want to kind of back up, had a couple of questions I wanted to
ask about Bullet, wanted to get a confirmation on. When Bullet first
started training, coming out on the field—we talked a bit earlier about
he ran the length of the field. Now Bullet runs out at the beginning with
the band, pre-game. Did Bullet at that time do that as well, run down the
middle of the field with the band, in those first few years?

Finley

Yes, at the very beginning.

Gill

So the routine has pretty much stayed the same with the exception of
running the length of the field.

Finley

Right, and by the time Bullet was Bullet, Bullet wasn’t running the
length of the field. Bullet was only running to the twenty yard line
because after the incident with Kenny Bailey and Penny, then it was
twenty to about the twenty-two yard line is as far as the horse ran.

Gill

You mentioned earlier that the first year or two, you were out there. You
were a part of the crew, the Spirit Rider crew.

26

Finley

Yes, I was the crew. (Laughter)

Gill

You, Eddy, and John Beall, that was about it. (Laughs)

Finley

Yes, that was it.

Gill

When did that change? Now they have a crew of about four or five that
help.

Finley

Oh, yes. It probably changed starting the next year. Eddy decided that
they needed a corps because we had two babies at home, and I told him I
couldn’t be the crew all the time.

Gill

If you got hurt what would you do? (Laughter)

Finley

He started saying we needed a Spirit Rider corps, and then he started
looking at sponsors like for the clothes and for the trailer. When
Stidham’s contacted him and said they wanted to donate a trailer, the
Spirit Rider program was not just a big deal for Oklahoma State. It was a
big deal for, really, the surrounding communities including Tulsa
because that saddle, the original saddle, came from Tulsa. That is a
beautiful saddle.

Gill

Do they still use the same saddle?

Finley

I don’t know if they still use the same saddle or not, but it was a
beautiful saddle. If they don’t, it’s a shame that they didn’t because that
was one gorgeous saddle.

Gill

Could you describe that a little bit for us? It had the neck…

Finley

Oh, yes. It had the halter and all the breast pieces. It was silver-inlaid
and tooled. I think Ed said it was between a ten-to-twelve-thousanddollar tack.

Gill

Wow.

Finley

All that was donated. Then, of course, Tener’s donated the clothes.

Gill

Did the Spirit Riders get to keep the clothes that they had through their
years as Spirit Rider?

Finley

Yes.

Gill

They’d find boots, as well?

27

Finley

No, they wore their own boots and their own hats. If you’re a real
cowboy, you’re particular about those kind of things. (Laughter) I found
out a long time ago.

Gill

One thing about Eddy, we were talking about his connections with the
Spirit Rider and OSU, but can you share a little bit about his career? He
had a life besides the Spirit Rider. After he finished his doctorate, he
came back on as assistant professor, worked his way through the ranks
as a full professor. Do you remember some of his research, some of his
activities, some of the things he did?

Finley

Yes, Eddy taught several courses. He taught an international agricultural
course that he basically put all the material together himself (there
wasn’t a textbook) and wrote the syllabuses for that. A company
contacted him and asked him if he would write a textbook. It’s called
International Agriculture. There is a copy of it in the public library here.
I don’t know if there’s a copy at OSU. I would pretty much think so
because it’s still sold. He wrote that book at home and at work. He also
asked Dr. Price to go in with him on that. Dr. Price really didn’t write
the textbook, but because he thought so highly of Dr. Price. At that time,
Dr. Price was an emeritus professor here. Ed had several publications.
He wrote the textbook. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, that
honorary fraternity. Again, as I said a while ago, highly intelligent, very
successful man. Had a waiting list for his international agriculture [class]
up to two years.

Gill

His courses were International Education and what others?

Finley

In Ag International Education, Agriculture. It was called International
Agriculture. He was an advisor to many undergraduate programs. He
had waiting lists, because people wanted Dr. Finley to be their advisor
because he made sure that they had everything they had to have before
they graduated, which a lot of advisors didn’t take a lot of time. On any
given week, we had three or four students in and out of our house at a
time, because he would bring them home to work with them so he
wouldn’t have to stay at the office so late.
Our house kind of had a revolving door because back in the early years
when the Spirit Rider and the corps and all of that, they would come in
the house, and they would eat, and they would go out, because every
Friday we’d bring the trailer over to our house and wash it and polish it.
The boys would get things ready. He was a member of about everything.
As I said before, he set goals for himself. He gave himself a time limit,
and during that time limit he accomplished those goals. Once he finished
with his goals, then he said, “I’m done. I’m giving up the Rodeo

28

Association. I’m giving up the Spirit Rider. I’m giving up all of that
because you’ve put up with me doing that all these years, and now it’s
going to just be time for us. I’m not staying late anymore, and I’m not
doing this,” and he did. Then he gave that up, and three months later he
got sick.
Gill

Did the Spirit Rider crew—we talked about the second year kind of put a
crew in. Did it consist primarily of students who had applied but
perhaps didn’t get the Spirit Rider?

Finley

Not necessarily, and, again, it was most of the members of the rodeo
club. Most of everything in the early years was taken from the rodeo
club just because of the experience that they had. The fourth year that we
had it, there was one young lady that was a member of the corps. She
really wanted to become Spirit Rider but she couldn’t handle the horse.
She wasn’t very happy when she was not chosen. I think her name was
Amanda something-or-another.

Gill

You mentioned that there is an Eddy Finley memorial garden by the Ag
Hall.

Finley

Right in front of Ag Hall.

Gill

Right in front there on Monroe Street. Can you talk a little bit about how
that came about and what the memorial says?

Finley

Well, Eddy died in May of ’96, and Bob Terry contacted me in January
of 1997 and said that he had met with the Board of Regents and with the
president (I’m trying to think of who the president was at that time)
[James Halligan] and that they wanted to do something in honor of Eddy
because of everything that he had given to the university in the name of
the Spirit Rider (it’s kind of hard to tell you about that because you
didn’t know my husband) and just because of who he was. My husband
was a great prankster. He was just fun. He was just a fun person. He said
that they wanted to take that area right in front of Ag Hall and develop a
garden, and they wanted to dedicate it to Eddy. I said, “Well, okay, that
was fine.” He said, “The only deal is that we want to present you with a
citation from Governor [Frank] Keating, and [Representative] Terry
Ingmire was going to present it to you and the children. Would you be
willing to do that?” I said, “Well, we can do that,” and I talked to the
kids first.
My son wasn’t really up for it, but he said he would do it because he was
only twelve when his dad died, and then our daughter was thirteen. So in
October of 1997, John Beall came for it, and most of the Spirit Riders
came for it. All of the Spirit Riders that had been under Eddy were there.

29

We dedicated this, and it’s a very pretty garden. The Landscaping and
Architecture Program keeps up the garden, and the Physical Plant, and
all that. Eddy had a favorite saying, and it was, “Teaching is art. You,
too, can be an artist. Choose your paintbrushes carefully.” On this
granite plaque is that saying that he said, and then it has his name on
there. That’s right in front of Ag Hall. Then I believe it was in 1999
when they wanted to dedicate the plaque that’s on the Spirit Rider.
Gill

We were talking earlier about the Spirit Rider initially being the mascot
of the band. I sense that there are not very many people that understand
that at Oklahoma State. Do you want to kind of elaborate on that a little
bit?

Finley

Well, Eddy was in his office, and the band director at the time (I believe
it was Bill Ballenger) called and said that the band wanted to have a
mascot. They wanted to have their own mascot, separate from Pistol
Pete, separate from the big OSU drum. They want something that would
distinguish them so he was wondering if Eddy could come up with
something that the band could say was their mascot. That’s kind of how
the concept of the Spirit Rider evolved. Probably, as I just said, the Spirit
Rider has probably now been incorporated into being one of the mascots
of Oklahoma State, but in the early inception of the Spirit Rider
program, probably the band members at that time and maybe a couple
years down the line knew that that was their mascot. Today, I doubt very
seriously if they do because it really wasn’t a widely publicized fact
whenever Eddy started the program.

Gill

What do we need to know about Eddy Finley that we don’t know, that
most people wouldn’t know?

Finley

Eddy was a very fun person. He was a huge prankster. You were lucky if
you could pull a prank on him because he knew every prank there was
and pulled many of them on his colleagues, as well as students, as well
as his family. He had a great passion for what he did. He loved teaching.
He loved his students. They loved him. He was a very humble man, a
very simple man. Meeting him, knowing him, you felt like you knew
him forever. He had no airs about him. Highly intelligent man, very
goal-oriented. Wonderful father, amazing friend, wonderful husband. He
was just the total package. He accomplished a lot in his life. It ended too
quickly.
But his lasting legacy to Oklahoma State University and to Texas Tech
University is the remembering of who he was by the people who knew
him, by the family that loved him, by the Spirit Rider program, by the
things that he accomplished in the short time he was a professor here at
OSU, for twelve years. That would have to, I think, be his legacy, would

30

be what he brought to the university in the short amount of time that he
was alive and able to accomplish what he did in the short amount of time
even after he became sick and continued to teach and to mold, as he
always said, young lives.
He didn’t think that when you got your bachelor’s that that was enough.
You needed to go ahead and get your master’s, and when you got your
master’s, he thought you needed to get your doctorate. He always
wanted to push you just a little step further. “You can do this, you can do
this, you can do this.” A lot of people went on to accomplish those goals.
Again, if you ask anybody that knew him, very few people will ever tell
you that he wasn’t a great guy. In fact, I can’t think of anybody that
would tell you he wasn’t a great guy. He was just the kind of person that
you really like and you liked immediately. He could be tough as nails.
He could dress you down, and while you were walking off, you’d think,
“Did he just get on to me about something?” He was very quiet. He was
very mild-mannered, but I think what people didn’t realize about him
more than anything was he had a great zest for living and people that fell
prey to his pranks. (Laughter) I’ll tell you about that, too. He and James
White were very, very close and very good friends. James was an
exceptional guy, and he’s greatly missed, too.

The Eddy Finley Memorial Garden not bearing, people had more on this
campus for him, (and he was only here twelve years) paying tribute to
the man whose vision and persistence were critical in launching the
OSU tradition of the Spirit Rider. Got to be pretty proud of that.

Finley

I am very proud of it. I’m proud of it for our children. I’m proud of it for
the legacy that he has left for Jessica and Justin and for their children,
my son’s daughter, the granddaughter that Eddy would’ve just been
crazy about. These are things that can’t be taken away. These are things
that are immortalized, that, “This is what your dad did,” or “This is what
your granddad did.” He’s missed every day by his family as if it was just
yesterday. We miss him. We miss his guidance, and we just miss him.
He’s been gone for fourteen years, but he’s still greatly loved and greatly
missed.

Gill

So tell me what’s happening in your life now, Nancy. What are you
doing?

Finley

My life, I raise my children. Our daughter, Jessica, graduated from the
University of Kansas. She graduated with a degree in human biology and
with a minor in toxicology, and she’s now a paramedic for Johnson
County in Kansas and lives in Lawrence. Our son, Justin, is a sergeant in
the United States Army, and he has served two tours of duty in Iraq. He
is an Army Ranger. He is a two-time awardee of the Purple Heart.

Outstanding young man. Engaged to a beautiful young lady who is also
a sergeant in the Army. They have a beautiful little precious baby girl,
seven months old, and her name is Sage Elizabeth Finley. She and
Mama are right now stationed in Belle Chasse, [Louisiana], and so
Daddy and Mama put lots of miles on the airline because one of them’s
going back and forth either every month or every other month. They’ll
be getting married in this next December. I am the health unit manager
at the Mercury [Marine] MerCruiser plant in Stillwater, and that’s about
it.
Gill

I appreciate you taking time. Is there anything we’ve missed, Nancy, we
want to talk about or bring up that we haven’t covered?

Finley

I think we covered the program very well. It was important that this
program succeed for Eddy because it was a program that he felt if it
caught on, the university would really like, so he was very cautious with
how he presented the program. He was very cautious not to go
overboard when it first started. One of the reasons why John was the first
Spirit Rider is because, again, of the relationship he had with John, and
he said the only way that he would become advisor or founder of this
program is if John Beall would become the first Spirit Rider. So John
didn’t have to go through all the rigmarole of everything. They talked
about it. John would come over to the house. They talked about it, kind
of cooked up a plan of what they were going to do, and, again, it was
just a little dog—Eddy called it a dog and pony show when it first
started, because that’s kind of what it was.

Gill

It really was. (Laughs)

Finley

And from there it has grown into this great tradition for the university, so
no matter where I go or no matter where his children go, they can look
back on pride that, “Yes, my dad started that program.” My friends, to
this day, when I’m on campus and they introduce me, they always say,
“Well, her husband, Dr. Finley, started the Spirit Rider program.” “Oh!”
Which is nice, but it’s not necessary, really. Bittersweet. Bittersweet
when you see the horse running out on the field, and I’m seeing my
husband standing down there on the field. But the program, the tradition,
has only gotten better and hasn’t changed too much, and that’s, I think, a
very big pat on the back and respectful of the people that have taken
over the program, that they have stayed within the tradition. That shows
the integrity, I think, of the program because you still have those people
that know how to ride a horse going out on that field, and that’s all Eddy
ever wanted. He wanted people to enjoy what they were doing, to be
safe while they were doing it, and to have a good time. I think that they
do, and I think it’s been a lot of fun. I’m proud in that aspect that it has
sustained as long as it has, and I think it will continue to. I mean, this is

We’re the Cowboys, after all.

That’s right. This is a great figurehead for that. It doesn’t take away
from Pistol Pete at all.
Did you sense that the Spirit Rider, being sort of the western motif, the
rodeo, the cowboy, the western heritage, being Cowboys, is that where
you felt like it fits in with that?
Yes, and Eddy wanted the Spirit Rider to be symbolic of a working
cowboy. That’s what he wanted it to be like. People had ideas of, “Oh,
let’s put him in a white outfit with orange chaps and fringe, and an
orange and white hat,” and Eddy goes, “Absolutely not. These people
that are on this horse are going to know how to ride, and they’re going to
look like a working cowboy. They’re going to look like a cowboy that’s
getting ready to go out and go branding or roping or going on a cattle
drive because that’s what this school is. This is an agriculture school so
we’re not out there to have some kind of silly looking guy sitting on a
horse.”
Some dude.

Gill
Finley

Yes, with a ten gallon hat that’s white, trimmed in orange. Eddy said,
“Absolutely not.” Pretty much, what Eddy asked for, he pretty much got
just because he was always prepared. He was never caught. He never did
anything by the seat of his pants, nothing, including stuff at the house.
When he had a project, it was perfect. When he built the deck at our
house, every slat, every post, everything was completely and specifically
set perfectly because he did not do anything unless he knew that it was
going to be perfect, and that’s just the legacy of the Spirit Rider. It was a
perfect fit for this university at that time, and it has continued to be.
When you see the plane crash that occurred with the basketball team, the
first picture they went to was the Spirit Rider horse. It’s a symbol of
what Oklahoma State has become, and that, I do take a great deal of
pride in. I take a great deal of pride in my husband and what he started.
And well you should. Thank you, Nancy. I appreciate it very much.

Gill
Thank you.
