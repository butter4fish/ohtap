Gary & Marilyn Jones
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Juliana Nykolaiszyn
August 27, 2012
Peabody, Kansas
Nykolaiszyn

My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University
Library. Today is Monday, August 27th, and I am in Peabody, Kansas,
interviewing Gary and Marilyn Jones as part of the O-STATE Stories
Oral History Project. Thank you so much for joining me today.

G. Jones

You’re welcome.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, we’d like to learn a little bit more about you. Gary, if you could
start first, please, and tell us the year you were born and where you
were born.

G. Jones

Well, actually, we were both born the same year in 1933, back in another
eon, you know. We graduated from Dexter, Kansas, which is right down
on the border—it’s in Cowley County on the border of Oklahoma. We
were the only two to go to college out of this class. And then also, at that
time, to be married and go to school, that was a no-no. We got married
on the second and moved to Stillwater on the seventh of September to
start school. I was in agriculture, and she was in home economics.
What did your parents do for a living?

Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones
M. Jones

Well, my dad was a farmer and also ran a locker plant in a grocery store.
Her dad was a full-time farmer, south of Dexter.
At that point, but when I was little, he worked for the Kanotex Refinery
out of Kansas City, which was closed down, and then he went out to
Colorado after they closed that. I had one sister, and we lived with my
grandparents, just around the corner. (Laughs) But we did live there
when I was in first grade, at least, up until—I’m not sure when we
moved out, about the third or fourth grade because I always went to
country school. He always lived in town. But I went to country school
and there were three years when there was just two of us, me and one
4

other one. (Laughs) That’s where, I think, I learned to speed read. I’m
not bragging, but I really read really fast! (Laughter) That’s my library
stack for the week above your head up there. (Gestures)
Wow! (Laughter) For the week!
Nykolaiszyn
Yes.
G. Jones
They’re not very heavy reading, though.
M. Jones
G. Jones

Nykolaiszyn

I guess maybe the reason we went to Oklahoma A&M at that time was
we had a young basketball coach that just graduated from down there.
He got to taking the basketball team down there to Stillwater my junior
and senior year, to the basketball games. So we kind of got acquainted
with the campus, and nobody ever took us to K-State so we went to
Oklahoma State instead. I attribute it to him taking us down there and
getting us acquainted with it. He would take the whole basketball team
down there, to take them to basketball games with Hank Iba and all that.
Was education something that was important in your family, to
encourage you?

M. Jones

It was in mine. My mom graduated in the very first class for Arkansas
City Juco [junior college]. My dad went one year to Phillips University,
which in that era, most people didn’t go to college.

G. Jones

Neither one of my parents, they just graduated from high school and
that’s it. Neither one of our sets of parents thought it would work, but I
guess it did. (Laughs)
Well, how did you two meet?

Nykolaiszyn
In high school.
G. Jones
In high school?
Nykolaiszyn
M. Jones

Well, I knew him before that because his dad used to drive a Standard
Oil truck and deliver oil out in the country.
That’s when I was a little guy.

G. Jones
M. Jones

He was a pest. (Laughs) One time, in high school, I was up changing the
clocks so we would get out of school early. And then he hollered, “She’s
at the clocks!” and got me in all kinds of trouble. (Laughs)
We weren’t perfect students in high school.

5

G. Jones
M. Jones

I went one year to Winfield High School, because my parents thought
that was a better education in Winfield. I hated it but I read every book
in the Winfield library, I think, almost. But then I went to Dexter. It was
a much smaller, to me, friendlier place. But it was just probably because
of the number of people.
There was a whole sum of eighteen in our graduating class.

G. Jones
Not too many more than that in the whole school! (Laughs)
M. Jones
G. Jones

We had chances to go to a private school in Winfield. They offered us a
scholarship. They didn’t have any agriculture, and I thought I wanted to
go into agriculture so we didn’t partake to that one. We went down to
Oklahoma State instead and had to work all the time because our
parents, they wouldn’t help us any.
Well, they couldn’t.

M. Jones
G. Jones

Well, they’d help us a little bit, you know. So, we worked in various jobs
at Oklahoma State. In fact, when we flew into Vet Village on the
seventh, somehow. I can’t remember how we got there, all the details,
but we landed up out there. Of course, at that time, the only thing they
had for married students was out there because married students just
didn’t go to school at that time, in 1951. But I went up to the post office
to get a box, because we all had to have boxes there. The post office was
in the Quonset building, like you showed, there.
I noticed up on the bulletin board that they wanted a butcher at the
commissary. Now, they had a commissary, a pretty good-sized one,
there in Vet Village for the veterans. But anyway, they had a sign up
where they wanted a butcher. Well, my junior and senior year of high
school, I worked as a butcher in my dad’s locker plant. So, I thought,
“Well…” I was looking for a job anyway so I ventured over there. They
jumped on me, and at that time, I got an extra fifteen cents an hour for
being a trained butcher. I got sixty-five cents an hour.
I got fifty cents an hour.

M. Jones
G. Jones

I thought that was big money, though. We worked out a deal where I
would fill the meat case of a morning, and I wouldn’t have any classes
until ten o’clock. So, I would go over there early, fill the meat case, the
meat in the meat case and go to class at ten o’clock. She worked for a
lady in home-ec, doing experimental different things. They worked on
sweet potato stuff and apple stuff, but they would make recipes and
make new recipes.

6

M. Jones

Mostly, I just typed. (Laughs) We did a lot of food stuff, but then type
up the recipes and so forth.
At that time, sixty-five cents an hour was…

G. Jones
That was good money.
Nykolaiszyn
Oh, yes.
G. Jones
M. Jones

If she hadn’t hired me—and she didn’t hire me out of the Oklahoma
State budget. She hired me out of her own…
She only got fifty cents.

G. Jones
M. Jones

She was an old maid lady. She had an investment, and when she died,
she even left me eight thousand dollars. She came here, at the nursing
home, and had planned to work as a dietician at the nursing home. She
never did marry, she never had a family. At the last few years, she didn’t
know up from down or anything. But how she made it, I have never
known because wages at that time for a single [person], even a college
instructor, were not good. They were terrible.
What was her name?

Nykolaiszyn
M. Jones
G. Jones

Eula Morris. If it hadn’t been for her, we probably wouldn’t have got
through.
Junior and senior year they closed the commissary down, because at the
Vet Village the population was dwindling and Safeway, and that was
bigger downtown. They closed it down so I was without a job. I went to
work in the audio-visual department under a guy named Guy Prichard.
Of course, their audio-visual department consisted mostly of sixteenmillimeter movie machines. I would take them around to different
classrooms and show these movies. They’d have different educational
movies. At night, the sororities and fraternities would rent out a
machine, and I would go show a movie there. They found out I was
married and they said, “Well, good. You can show the child birth movie
and some of the ones that…”
X-rated stuff. (Laughs)

M. Jones
G. Jones

X-rated, you know? (Laughter) So, I got this job. I got a little extra
money for hauling all their equipment in my pickup to the sorority and
fraternity houses at night. But then we also, during weekends, I would
work for Ms. Morris, too, because she always had things that needed to

7

be repaired or fixed or whatever around her house.
Or out in the yard…
M. Jones
She helped us quite a bit, then. But that kept us alive, I guess. (Laughs)
G. Jones
Nykolaiszyn

Well, tell me a little bit more about Vet Village and what your living
accommodations were like.
Okay.

G. Jones
M. Jones
G. Jones

I drew a sketch, here. (Gestures) Sixteen by sixteen. It’s just like this
picture.
I don’t know whether this will pick it up or not. But this was the house
and it was sixteen by sixteen. And as you can see, it was very plain.
They moved them in. They weren’t pre-fab, but they were all made out
of plywood. The walls were three-quarter-inch thick.
Well, I’d call them pre-fab. They just slapped them up there. (Laughs)

M. Jones
G. Jones

But it was real compact in there. It worked out pretty good. The
bathroom was so small you walked in and backed out. (Laughter) But it
was completely furnished. It had a stove. I think maybe the stove was in
it. I don’t know.
It was. It was. But we had to buy our refrigerator.

M. Jones
G. Jones

At least it had natural gas so we had a gas cook stove. We had to buy our
own refrigerator, and so we bought a small refrigerator. She had an old
treadle sewing machine. We brought it and one of us would study off—
that was one of the desks that I always studied off the kitchen table,
which was just a small portion of the table.
Actually, we still have that. (Laughs)

M. Jones
In fact, we’ve still got it over in barn. (Laughs)
G. Jones
M. Jones

We never use it in here, but we still have it. And we had a radio, one of
the few.
It was an FM radio.

G. Jones
M. Jones

At that point, they had so many students and the field house was very
small so only half of the students got to go. If you were the half that
didn’t get to go, you could usually swap somebody for a ticket. But a lot

8

of people would come to our house, and we’d all gather around the radio
to listen. Lynn [Gary and Marilyn’s daughter] said to be sure and tell
you this. I was brought up on radio. My dad always listened to the St.
Louis Cardinals and the Brooklyn Dodgers, in that era. She found, when
we were hunting for this stuff, my eighth grade graduation speech,
which I gave and said one of the things I was busy doing was listening to
ballgames. (Laughs) I thought that was funny, because then we listened
to ballgames. Well, on Saturday morning, I would clean the house and
we had Jack Armstrong: the All-American Boy, Sergeant Preston of the
Yukon, The Green Hornet, and the villain was the Praying Mantis. I
remember him. It seemed like there was one other one, but that was our
Saturday—my Saturday morning.
G. Jones

And the nice part about it was everybody out there was in the same boat.
They were poor, I mean. They were in school, yes, but they didn’t have
much money to spend, other than going to school. So, they would come
over for ballgames because we had the only FM. I think we got it for
maybe our wedding gift or something, I don’t know. Then also, we
could only go to half the basketball games. We could go to all the
football—no, it was—yes, it was all the football games. But at that time,
the Oklahoma State football team was so bad, everybody beat them.
(Laughs) But the basketball team was the opposite. Under Hank Iba it
was so good. And then also, somebody got us going to the wrestling
matches. At that time, they had a national winning team. They’d let all
the students that wanted to, to go to the wrestling matches because they
didn’t have that many at the game. So, we got to be quite the wrestling
fans, too, because they had an excellent, good team.
Let’s see, what else? We had a pickup that my dad loaned us to go to
school. We couldn’t go home very often, because we couldn’t afford to
buy the gas to come back up to Dexter. So, we’d come home on
Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter, and that was about it. At that
time, my folks was still in the locker plant. When we’d come home
they’d give us a box of meat to help us along. We got so tired of just
eating beef that we would trade the steaks sometimes for bologna.
(Laughter) Some of the neighbors had bologna. We’d trade them steaks
for that bologna, because we just got tired of beef all the time, and
they’d give you a variety of things.
We had a garden back behind the house.

M. Jones
G. Jones

Yes, we had a garden right behind the house because we had a swamp
cooler in this back window, back here.
What’s a swamp cooler?

Nykolaiszyn

9

An evaporative cooler. You ran water over a [coil].
M. Jones
Run water through it.
G. Jones
M. Jones

…like a—let’s see. What’s comparable? Well, it’s actually like the
filtering present-day air conditioners, but you ran water over it. And we
didn’t have any recycling mechanism, obviously, so all the water just…
We ran the water out on the garden.

G. Jones
Oh, okay.
Nykolaiszyn
M. Jones
G. Jones

M. Jones

We had a lovely mint patch, and my home-ec teachers were always so
impressed that I could bring mint to garnish things with. (Laughter)
I worked there at the commissary for two years under E.M. Osteen, we
called him Emo. That was his initials, you know. He was a nice old guy,
and he was jolly to work with. His wife was a little bit nuts, but that’s all
right. We got along.
We had a clothesline up there by the garden. One year we had such a
good cantaloupe crop that I was taking around and giving them to
neighbors. Some people thought I was selling them. (Laughs) They
didn’t want any, but I was just giving them away. We had so many of
them. (Laughter)
Would other people have gardens around?

Nykolaiszyn
I don’t think so.
M. Jones
Not too many.
G. Jones
M. Jones
G. Jones

M. Jones

I tried to remember if anybody did. I couldn’t think of anybody, but we
always gardened. We always had one.
One year I took Horticulture I under Frank LeCrone, and one of the
requirements there was you had to develop a vegetable garden. So, we
had a vegetable garden there. It was down there right behind—probably
the old infirmary is not there anymore. But anyway, there was some
patches right behind it where we were allowed to develop a garden, and
we got graded on the garden. I didn’t get graded too high because a few
weeds got in it.
That’s a problem today, too. (Laughter) That was, I guess, our only
social life, is we did belong to the Horticulture Club. We learned to
make cider. We blew some up in the closet one time. (Laughter)

10

G. Jones

They probably still make cider for money-making things, don’t they? Or
did they?
I’m not sure.

Nykolaiszyn
M. Jones

But that’s something we do to this day. If we have apples, we still make
apple cider.

G. Jones

Yes, we have our own cider press and things. But the Horticulture Club,
they got the apples from the school farm…
It was a money-making thing for them.

M. Jones
…and made cider. And then they sold it at Homecoming football games.
G. Jones
M. Jones

Nykolaiszyn

One of the things that we did in the foods lab was develop things to do
with apples. One of them was making cider floats, which is nothing but
cider with vanilla ice cream in it and a dash of nutmeg on the top. But
it’s really good, and I don’t know of anybody else that makes them. But
it is good.
You mentioned the commissary in Vet Village. What were some of the
other things that Vet Village had that the rest of the campus did not.
Laundry.

M. Jones
G. Jones

And we had our own post office. All these were in Quonset villages.
And then also, just to the east of our house was the Vet Village
gymnasium. It was just a big old building that had a basketball court in
there, and you could go down and play basketball. I never had time to
play basketball. But anyway, they did. I think that’s about all the…
I don’t think they had any other…

M. Jones
That’s about all they had.
G. Jones
M. Jones

If you wanted to shop, and could shop, you had to go to downtown
Stillwater. One summer, Gary had to go to officer’s training at Fort
Benning, Georgia, and so…
ROTC.

G. Jones
M. Jones

…so he took the vehicle. If I needed something, I walked to town, just
like five miles. So, you didn’t walk very often. (Laughs) But the campus

11

wasn’t that far away, basically.
But you had to get across campus to get clear on downtown in Stillwater.
G. Jones
Were you able to make friends in Vet Village even though you weren’t
veterans?
Nykolaiszyn
Oh, yes. Well, let’s see. There was…
G. Jones

…two couples that we visited a lot with, one right next to us.

M. Jones

And they were non-veterans, too.

G. Jones

Well, both of them were. And then the other one…

M. Jones

…across the street, he was…

G. Jones

He was across the street.

M. Jones

He was a poultry major, which there weren’t that many poultry majors,
then. He was originally from Massachusetts. In fact, both of them were
from Massachusetts. Let’s see. She worked.

G. Jones

She was an artist. She did paintings and stuff.
M. Jones

And he went to school.

G. Jones

She supported them.

M. Jones

Yes. Well, there was a few other people. I remember Pete and Marilee.
They were older. They were from back east, too. They were weekend
friends or something like that.

G. Jones

We really didn’t have time to visit very much.
M. Jones

No, you didn’t have time to do too much visiting.

G. Jones

You had to work to stay alive. (Laughs)

M. Jones

Work and go to school.

G. Jones

Just to the ballgame and that was about it.

M. Jones

We both carried about fifteen to seventeen hours a semester, plus
working full-time. So, it kept you pretty busy, and so you didn’t have a
lot of social time. (Laughs)

G. Jones

12

Did you live in Vet Village your whole time on campus?
Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones

All four years. They would let us keep the place. I don’t remember
whether we had to pay rent or not. The rent was thirty dollars a month. I
was in ROTC all four years—well, the first two years, you were required
to be in ROTC. I don’t think they are now. But then the draft was hot on
my heels because I was in the Air Force the first two years of ROTC.
Well, we got up to go to Advanced ROTC, and you had to have 20/20
vision without glasses. Well, I didn’t. They said you had to have that to
fly. Well, I didn’t want to fly, anyway.
Well, the draft board sent me notice that, “You will be drafted.” So, I
went across the street to the Army ROTC. They were glad to have me so
I got into it, the Advanced ROTC. This helped a great deal because I got
twenty-nine dollars a month, then, from ROTC. Well, that lacked a
dollar paying the rent, and it helped us survive pretty well. Once we
started to get our extra twenty-nine a month, we thought we were in
heaven, you know. (Laughs)
Let’s see. The last year, maybe junior year, I worked in Simex Locker
Plant. It’s not there anymore. In fact, we went by there. They tore the
whole thing down. But Simex had a locker plant and also, they made ice.
I had a job there of an evening. Evening and Saturday, I went in to clean
up the saws and all the equipment. And then Saturday I worked as a
meat cutter then at that…

M. Jones

We were there in the days of segregation. I worked at the hotel and the
Boston Pops orchestra came through, and Paul Robeson sang with them,
and he could stay there on campus, but he couldn’t stay downtown in a
hotel, because he was black. [He] couldn’t use the fountain and all that
sort of thing.
You worked at the Atherton?

Nykolaiszyn

It’s what it is, now, I think.

M. Jones

Okay.

Nykolaiszyn

But it was just, at that point…

M. Jones

The Student Union Hotel?

Nykolaiszyn

…it was with the Student Union Hotel, yes.

M. Jones

And it was relatively new, then.

13

G. Jones

Yes, it was.

M. Jones

In fact, we went back and stayed in it just a year or so ago.

G. Jones

Yes, our grandson graduated from high school. (Laughs)

M. Jones

He graduated from Perkins High School. And it was fifty years ago to
the year that she was a clerk in hotel. It wasn’t called the Atherton, then.

G. Jones
M. Jones

No, it was an Atherton, somebody left money, I think. It was just the
hotel at the Student Union at that point. But I finished at mid-term, and
he still had time to go. And then he had summer school that one year.
On account I took ROTC, that kind of took a lot of my hours.

G. Jones

Took his time out of there.

M. Jones

Well, the Student Union back then was the Waldorf Astoria of student
unions.

Nykolaiszyn
Oh, it was. Right.
M. Jones

Yes.

G. Jones

Tell me about the hotel. What was it like?

Nykolaiszyn

She didn’t get in, hardly. She worked the desk.

G. Jones

As far as I was concerned, it was a really good job. But other than
working there, I don’t…

M. Jones
It was just a job.
G. Jones
M. Jones

I guess the things I think about nowadays, they wouldn’t happen today,
because a lot of it had to do with whether you were black or white.
(Laughs) And you didn’t have black students on campus, either. The
only time I did—in graduate school they could be black. One summer, I
went to summer school and he was gone. I had this wonderful lady who
she said, “Oh, Lord, Honey, you don’t think I let my husband see me, do
ya?!” (Laughs) And she’d get in the closet to get dressed. She was a
home-ec teacher from I don’t remember where, from somewhere. But I
had some really wonderful experiences with people that otherwise you
couldn’t talk to.
At that time, they all went to Langston.

14

G. Jones

Right.

Nykolaiszyn

Now, even the whites go to Langston.

G. Jones

Langston, supposedly, has a really good goat department that I’d like to
go visit.

M. Jones
The best goat program.
G. Jones

Really?

Nykolaiszyn

We’ll have to take you out and show you our goats out here.

M. Jones

That’d be awesome. (Laughter) Did you find it challenging being
married students?

Nykolaiszyn
We didn’t know any different.
G. Jones

We didn’t know any difference. (Laughs)

M. Jones

We were both eighteen.

G. Jones

I think I should say I was out in the country, and we didn’t have
electricity or water or even good roads that you could go on if it rained.
We had a car but you didn’t go on that kind of road. And we didn’t have
a telephone. His folks had the first TV in the country, but I don’t know
whether that was good or bad. It’s so different than anybody today. He
always had conveniences, at least. (Laughs) But I think that sort of
shaped the way we grew up. We weren’t expecting a lot so it wasn’t so
bad not to have it, because you didn’t know any different.

M. Jones

You look back, and we were quite frugal, I guess.
G. Jones
M. Jones

My sister was sick a lot. Before penicillin came along, she had a lot of
earaches. The Missouri Pacific railroad track went really close—about as
far from here out to the road. If they would take her over to the Arkansas
City doctor, Mom would go out and flag the train down and get on the
train. You could go in in the morning at ten o’clock and come back in
the afternoon at two. But the roads were so bad you didn’t drive it if it
turned out that way.
Lots of change since 1951, you know. (Laughs)

G. Jones

Yes.

15

Nykolaiszyn

It doesn’t seem like that long ago, but…

M. Jones

Well, do you have any teachers that really stand out in your mind?

Nykolaiszyn

Yes, I do. The lady I worked for, although she was never my teacher, but
I saw her teaching. And then had another lady—well, Dean O’Toole was
the dean of home economics. Oh, I can’t think of the lady’s name—Ms.
McAlister, she was an old battle axe. We had to live in the home
management house for six weeks. She told me, “You can’t eat cold
wieners, you had to warm them!” (Laughter)

M. Jones

Yes, cooked weenies.
G. Jones
M. Jones

G. Jones

M. Jones

I remember that so plainly. (Laughter) But there was another lady,
whose name I cannot remember, and she was the one that encouraged
me. She kept saying, “You’re hiding your light under a bushel basket.
You could go out and be…” I was so timid I couldn’t talk. Obviously,
now, I won’t shut up. But she said, “You could give speeches and that
sort of thing, if you would just do it.” But I had to take a speech class,
and I remember this was a man. He said, “Are you physically deformed
that you can’t open your mouth?” (Laughter) I was so scared I couldn’t
do it. But the lady really encouraged me a lot. Wright. Her name was
Wright. I can’t think of what her first name was.
I don’t remember. There are some of them I remember, but their names
have slipped me. I do remember J.C. Hilliard. He was the swine
instructor. They always called him Hog Hilliard. Let’s see. Who was the
meats man?
I don’t know, but I remember taking a psychology class in Old Central,
and somebody went to sleep and the professor threw an eraser at him
and hit him right square in the face. (Laughter)
Yes, we can’t get away with that, today. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

They’d throw you in jail!

G. Jones

It was very effective! (Laughter)

M. Jones

They had a shop class. I got into agriculture education about my junior
and senior year, and I had to take a—well, altogether different classes.
One of them was a shop class, and I still remember the instructor, but I
can’t recall his name. He kind of felt sorry for me. He’d give me
Saturday jobs to come in and clean up the shop. At the time, he lived in
Vet Village, too, even though he was an instructor. He’d give me jobs so
I could make a few bucks.

G. Jones

16

Dr. Norton was a dairy professor.
M. Jones

Yes, he was very good.

G. Jones

We just talked about him yesterday, and he went to K-State. Well, at
least after he was there, we knew him at K-State. He was just a really
nice guy that taught a lot about cheese and that sort of thing.

M. Jones

Fred LeCrone was the horticulture instructor, and he moved up to, I
think, the assistant dean or something like that, later on. When I took my
first classes, I got kind of interested in horticulture along with my
agriculture education classes. For some reason I didn’t care too much for
the shop part, but I was interested in horticulture. I remember I took
commercial vegetables and gee, I don’t know what else. But Fred
LeCrone still sticks in my mind.
I liked to take horticulture, because it was an easy way to get an A.
(Laughs) My grandma always gardened, and I guess we always
gardened.
In fact, it even carried over when I went to teach it in Peabody. I started
the first horticulture department in the state—I mean, the first
horticulture classes. Now, they’ve got a full-time teacher up there with a
greenhouse and the whole bit. Just because I was interested in
horticulture and not interested in fixing engines and stuff.
Well, Marilyn, you mentioned the practice house.

Nykolaiszyn

Home management house.

M. Jones

The home management house, can you tell me where it was located on
campus?

Nykolaiszyn
No, I can’t.
M. Jones

Okay.

Nykolaiszyn

It was out at the edge, and it was a regular house. You’re supposed to
learn to dust with two hands, I learned that. (Laughter) I could look at
dust and not even see it today, but…

M. Jones

What were some of the other things you had to do in the house? How did
it work?
Nykolaiszyn
I’ve forgotten. There were like six of us, maybe, that had to live out

17

M. Jones

there. We had to have regular meals and learn to make the bed just so-so
and have the meals and serve in courses. That type of thing, which was
totally different than what I was brought up doing in my relatively poor
environment there. It was all different to me. But I did learn to make the
bed so you turn the tops, you know. We have a bed and breakfast down
there. To this day, I make a bed, turn the top sheet over like that, which
that was one thing you had to do. (Laughs) Dusting with two hands and
be sure to cook the wieners, I remember that. (Laughter) The lady was
an old maid lady, and she was very… (Laughs)
She was strict. We used to laugh about it at home.

G. Jones
M. Jones

G. Jones

…very particular. But the foods lady that I said made such an
impression, there were certain things—well, Ms. McAlister, the home
management lady, she wanted you to—you know, you should be able to
make biscuits and muffins and a simple cake without a recipe. You
ought to be able to…certain things that you just should know. That’s all
there was to it. (Laughs)
I had to go out student teaching, what, senior year? At that time, we only
spent six weeks out student teaching, and they always sent two out. I
mean, you went out in pairs, and there was a reason for that because one
was teaching and one would critique the other one, and [that] worked out
real well. I happened to draw my partner that went with me. He was
from way down in southeast Oklahoma. He was a coon hunter. That was
his pastime. All he could talk about was running coons with his coon
dogs. He was really quite a character. But we kind of thought alike in
student teaching so we worked out very well.
Also, we would try to protect each other when Dr. Orr come out to check
us. We’d get the wind that he was coming out so we’d work together.
We covered each other’s back when he come out. But the practice
teacher that was there, he was kind of a show bum. He was gone all the
time, looking for steers and pigs and everything else. We were expected
to do that, too. Also, he was busy with show animals or just different
shows. It was in the spring when they had spring shows. We were gone
all the time so we didn’t get to teach very much. We found out that, I
think, Dr. White was coming out. He was a great big ole guy, but he was
jolly. We kind of cooked up the lesson that we was going to teach,
because we’d been out scrubbing calves and pigs and everything else
during school time. We weren’t teaching any, but we had to teach when
they come out. They didn’t want to see us scrubbing pigs. So, we
dreamed up some class to satisfy him. He was pretty upset that we
hadn’t been teaching in class all the time. He said, “I’m thinking about
transferring you guys to another location.” “Oh, no. We really like it
here.” (Laughter) And we convinced him to leave us alone.

18

M. Jones

Home economics didn’t work that way. I was able to practice teaching
right there in Stillwater, and we had to teach for a whole semester.
Although, I remember going over to Pawhuska and observing, at one
point. That was Osage Indian country over there, and again, there was
the segregation thing. The Indians, if you were an Osage, you had a lot
of money, probably. But if you were a Ponca, and we went right by
Ponca on our way up when we came back to Kansas, they had absolutely
nothing. The Ponca Indians over there, they were [poor]. It was good to
be an Osage over there.
They had oil money.

G. Jones

They had money, and they were on campus quite a bit, driving big cars
and so forth.

M. Jones
G. Jones

Yes, I remember in agriculture, we had an Indian girl in class. Her
mother would bring her to school every morning in a big, long Buick.
We used to kind of chuckle about it.
Fannie Beartrack, wasn’t it? (Laughs)

M. Jones

Fannie Beartrack.

G. Jones

I hadn’t thought about her for a long time.

M. Jones

She was a good student, but her mom brought her to school every
morning, to class anyway, in a big ole long Buick. (Laughs)

G. Jones
Of course, today, I think your car tag says, “Native American,” or
something on it. [Native America]
M. Jones
Right, yes. Yes.
Nykolaiszyn

At that time, if you were an Indian, you weren’t very high on the social
scale.

G. Jones
M. Jones

No. We had to learn the Five Civilized Tribes, because we had to have
Oklahoma history to get a teaching certificate. I used to know them. I
don’t know that I do anymore.

G. Jones

One of the questions was, “In what county is the highest elevation?”
They had some dumb questions on there, really. (Laughs) It was a
standard test. You had to have it for Oklahoma history.
I had to have an hour of swimming. I made it around the pool without

19

drowning so I passed. (Laughs)
M. Jones
Was it in the old Armory building?
Nykolaiszyn

I can’t remember where it was.

M. Jones

It had kind of a track on the top, maybe?

Nykolaiszyn

Yes, that’s where the swimming pool was. Yes, she had to swim across
the swimming pool.

G. Jones
No, I had to go clear around it.
M. Jones

I didn’t have to take all those classes because I was in ROTC. That took
care of it.

G. Jones
M. Jones

I didn’t have to take math or I probably never would’ve graduated. I had
to take art and that was kind of fun. But those were just requirements
that you had to have for a teaching certificate. I can’t say they
contributed to your education, particularly, but you had to have them.
(Laughs)
So were you thinking that you both wanted to become teachers?

Nykolaiszyn

No, never heard of it.

G. Jones

I just wanted, if I had a family, to be able to support them. I didn’t
particularly want to teach, but I wanted something to fall back on if I had
to.

M. Jones

G. Jones

The first two years I was in general agriculture, just took ag classes. But
then I got to looking around, “Where am I going to go? How am I going
to make a living?” There was no farm to go back to at home. And at that
time, you could get a farmland job, but that was nothing. So, I got to
thinking, “Well, I’ve got to do something.” Somehow, somebody
convinced me to go into ag education. They said, “Go in ag education
and also, you can run the FFA program.” Well, I didn’t know what the
FFA program was. We didn’t have FFA in the little school I came from.
I got kind of interested in it and went into ag education. That’s where I
stayed the rest of my life, I guess.
I remember Dr. Orr was there. We called him Pappy Orr—not to his
face. He was a little short-statured man, gray hair. I still remember him.
You’d go in to see him and he’d kind of look, “What do you want?!”
(Laughs) You felt like he was just going to eat you alive. I remember I
went in and talked to him one time. “What do you want?!” I said, “Have

20

you got time to visit a little bit?” “Sure, I’ve got time!” (Laughs) That’s
just kind of the way he was. But then Dr. White, he was a real big, jolly
man. He was nice to visit with. But Dr. Orr was the head of the
department so he’s the one you had to talk to. At that time, it was
upstairs in Whitehair. Whitehair?
Whitehurst.
Nykolaiszyn

Yes, that’s where it was, the ag-ed department.

G. Jones

Okay.

Nykolaiszyn

I graduated—here again, the ROTC threw me behind. I had to go to
summer school, my last summer school, to get out. So I thought, “Well,
I’ll just go right into the Army once I graduate. No problem.” Well, your
orders come out in the middle of August, which, boom. They didn’t
want me until the first of December. Well, I had to go from August until
the first of December. I had to eat, and so Dr. Orr said, “Oh, go ahead
and get you a job. They’ll defer you. No problem.” Well, where do you
go to find a teaching job on the last of August?

G. Jones

So, he looked at his file and says, “Well, I’ve got three here available,”
which that was a lot of openings. One of them was in Kansas, Leon,
Kansas. I thought, “That’s too close to home. I don’t want to start
teaching very close to home.” He said, “I’ve got two in Illinios.” Well, I
said, “I used to have an uncle that lived in Illinois and always liked the
country. I’d like to go up there and investigate.” So, he stuck my
transcript in an envelope and that was it. (Laughter) And I was on the
road looking for a job in Illinois.
We went to the first one and the old superintendent had been the
wrestling coach in Tech High School in Indianapolis for years, but he
finally got his administrator certificate. He had taken this job as
superintendent in this little town of Allendale, Illinois, with a population
of 300 at the most. But anyway, we cycle in there and lo and behold he
was from Mulvane, Kansas, originally. He found out we was originally
from Kansas, and he took to us like a father. He hired me, too. Started
out at forty-two hundred for eleven months. I stayed there a year because
I knew I had to go take care of my ROTC duty.
Sure enough, it come up the first of December, and I was supposed to
go. I was still in school, see. He said, “What am I going to do for an ag
teacher?” I said, “I don’t know. Well, they kind of promised me they
would defer me going in until the end of school.” He said, “Well, who’s
that guy on there?” It was some captain that wrote out these orders. He
picked up the telephone, called him. He chewed on him unmercifully

21

and when he got done chewing him, this captain said, “Well, when
would he like to go to duty?” (Laughter) So, yes, he got me deferred,
then, until the end of the year. Well, it was in November, and I still had
the same problem. There was a gap in there but I found a job then in detasseling corn.
That’s the only place I was ever homesick for. The people were so
friendly and so nice to us. Actually, Mike was born in Illinois.
M. Jones
We found a little place at the edge of town that you weren’t in town. The
guy that owned the place had a bunch of goats out there.
G. Jones
And we took care of his goats. (Laughs)
M. Jones
G. Jones

M. Jones

He hired me to feed his goats. It was kind of like this place. It was out at
the edge of town. And then I got a job de-tasseling corn. And once we
got done de-tasseling corn, I went into where we took the corn and I was
in charge of the corn drier, then, for the Sea Corn Company. I worked
for them until December when I went to Fort Benning, Georgia.
Illinois was so different than Kansas. I mean, there were trees, it was
green everywhere. Here, it’s not true anymore so much, but if there’s
trees, you think there’s a creek there, there’s some water there. Well, in
Illinois, of course, there was stuff everywhere.
And it rained every week.

G. Jones
M. Jones

We had this wonderful lady that lived next to us. She was a
grandmother-type, and she would say, “Now, don’t worry. When you get
tired of blackberries there’ll be something else coming on.” She taught
us how to find wild mushrooms, and she was just a dear, dear lady.
We were just way out there in Illinois on our own.
But they made us so welcome. It was a wonderful place to live.

G. Jones
M. Jones
G. Jones

We lived on the—they called it “the square.” It was a mile square. There
were people that lived around. They said, “Oh, yes…” They didn’t take
to strangers too well. They said, “Yes, there’s some newcomers right
down the road, there.” “How long they been there?” “Oh, they’ve been
there twenty-five years.” (Laughter) They were still newcomers.
(Laughs)
I thought it was forty years.
But they took care of us just like we had always been there.

22

M. Jones
G. Jones

And until just, say, the past ten years, we kept in touch with quite a few
of them.

M. Jones

Yes, even the old superintendant. I used to call him all the time.
He came by and stayed with us one time.

G. Jones
So, you ended up in Fort Benning…
M. Jones
Yes. They had to go through officer training.
Nykolaiszyn
Briefly.
G. Jones
M. Jones
G. Jones

Had to go through officer’s training at Fort Benning. They used to call it
Fort Benning School for Boys. And then the Korean War was winding
down, but they were still sending a lot of green second lieutenants to
Korea. Well, they come around and said, “Who wants to volunteer for
ranger and also jump school?” Not this guy! But some of the guys said,
“Oh, you sign up for those, you won’t have to go to Korea.” Well, I said,
“I’m not signing up for anything.” There was a bunch of us that didn’t
sign up for anything. Well, once we got done with school, all the ones
that signed up for ranger airborne went straight to Korea.
Wow.

Nykolaiszyn

The rest of us, they sent us to Fort Jackson at South Carolina and also
Fort Bliss in North Carolina, to take recruits through basic training. I
went through basic training eight times. (Laughs)

G. Jones
During all this, what are you doing, Marilyn?
She was tagging along.
Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones
M. Jones

Mike was born the first year we taught school. We have two kids. I was
so far out in the country, I’d never taken care of a baby in my whole life.
Babysitting wasn’t anything I’d ever done and that was a big chore as far
as I was concerned. (Laughs) [phone rings]
But as I said, I had never been around any babies so taking care of Mike
was just a major, major thing. But again, the very same thing that I guess
has always bugged me was the south was really segregated. Gary’s
commanding officer was black. We had really nice neighbors on both
sides. We lived out in the community. They said, “Don’t you ever bring
anybody out here like that.” I mean, we could’ve been real good friends,
but that wasn’t the way the world…

23

We just had to be good friends on post.
The only place I ever saw the Ku Klux Klan march.
G. Jones
M. Jones
G. Jones

Mike, our son, was just a baby down there in South Carolina. Also, we
had an English bulldog. She was a pretty good size, and she just liked
sitting in the front door, I mean behind the screen and just sit there.
That’s where she liked to sit. The neighbors across the street thought we
had a really deformed baby because that bulldog would just sit there in
the sun. (Laughter)
But it was pretty country. Again, it was so different because they had
things that don’t grow here, like flowers that grow there and azaleas and
camellias and that sort of thing.

M. Jones
It rained fourteen days straight one time.
G. Jones
M. Jones

G. Jones

So, we got to see different country, visit some plantations as far as that.
Of course, the money was good from our standpoint. It was the most
we’d ever had in our whole lives. But we hated it, whew! Couldn’t
hardly count the days until we got out of it.
Oh, we hated it every day. Most of the ones that I worked for out on
post, they were real nice. And at this time, Mike could just kind of walk
a little bit. I’d take him out there to get a haircut, because we had a
barber in our company. He’d cut his hair for a quarter so I’d take him out
there all the time. We got pretty close to the cadres there, because the
troops would come and go every eight weeks. That’s how long we’d
have.
But the pay was good, and we shopped at the commissary on base and…

M. Jones

I was paid $222 dollars a month. We thought, “Man, that’s a lot of
money!” (Laughs)

G. Jones

Some hurricane came along. I can’t remember which one it was, but
Gary had a sergeant—where was he from, Puerto Rico?

M. Jones

Yes.

G. Jones

Anyhow, I’d taken Mike out to the base. I don’t remember why I had.
But right in front of me, the pine trees were just snapping along like this.
(Gestures) This man knew what it was, a hurricane. I didn’t know.

M. Jones
Sergeant Martinez…

24

G. Jones

The rest of the world didn’t know, and he was trying to warn them, but
he couldn’t remember any English. So, all he was telling them was in
Spanish. (Laughs)

M. Jones
Yes, he couldn’t talk English too well. When he’d get excited, he
couldn’t talk English at all.
G. Jones

Nothing actually happened.

M. Jones

And he was just running around there just going nuts. All you could get
out of him was “hurricane.”

G. Jones

We were sure not where we were supposed to be.

M. Jones

Those trees were just going right down. Yes, I often wonder what ever
happened to—that ole sergeant was a real good ole boy.

G. Jones

When you’re in the service, are you thinking about what’s going to
happen after you leave?

Nykolaiszyn

Oh, yes.
We couldn’t hardly wait to get out of there.

G. Jones
What were you thinking? What was going to be next?
M. Jones
Finding a teaching job to make a living.
Nykolaiszyn
M. Jones

I was on guard duty one night, and on guard duty you’re required to stay
awake, but you having nothing to do. So, I would read regulations in the
Army.

G. Jones
Just for fun? (Laughs)
Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones

Yes, just to stay awake. (Laughter) And one of them in there, it said
something about you could get early release for teaching or going to
school because you had to get out at a certain time to teach and go to
school. I got to figuring up if when my time was up, my two years was
up, at that time, you had to serve two years as an officer. Today, you
have to serve six years. But anyway, that really struck a—I thought,
“Man, I can get out.” I believe it was thirty days or six weeks early. I
thought, “Anything to get out of here.”
I start making contacts back here about teaching jobs, and teaching jobs
weren’t too plentiful. I threw out hooks in Missouri, Kansas, and

25

Oklahoma to try to land a job. Well, we found a couple here in Kansas.
Well, we found one in Missouri, but as soon as they found out that I
didn’t graduate from University of Missouri they weren’t interested in
me. They said, “Oh, we don’t have much.” So, I come on back,
interviewed at one or two here, and then we still had some time so I was
down in Oklahoma. So, I went into the vocational office to see about a
teaching job in Oklahoma. Well, they found out we were just recently
from Kansas, but went to school at Oklahoma so they weren’t interested
either.
So, we come back to Kansas, and we spent a whole day messing around
in Fort Scott. Fort Scott was open, which is over in eastern Kansas.
Liked the looks of it, liked the looks of the town and everything. But
there was a guy that they was waiting on him to make up his mind. He
had some experience, plus he had his master’s degree, and I was second
in line. Well, this guy finally made up his mind, and so, “So long.” But
there was a job in western Kansas open, out by Dodge City, little town
of Ford.
Before that, we went out to Johnson and interviewed.
M. Jones
G. Jones

Well, we was at Ford and I interviewed, and they offered me a contract.
Here I was in August, and school was going to start in September. So,
they were hungry for anybody. They offered me the job, but then also,
Johnson was opened up. That is in the far west, right next to Colorado so
we went out there. We had the contract in my pocket, and we was
hoping somebody would offer me a little more money, but they didn’t.
First question they asked was if you were Catholic. If you were, that was
the end of the interview.

M. Jones

Yes.
But we weren’t, so… (Laughs)

G. Jones
They wouldn’t hire a Catholic.
M. Jones
Wow.
G. Jones
That was just the difference of time.
Nykolaiszyn
M. Jones
G. Jones

They didn’t have an agriculture department at Johnson, but they wanted
to start one. They said, “We’ll just give you a check that you can buy
anything you want to start out.” Then also, they said, “You’ll be
assistant football coach.” I said, “Wait a minute. The first football game
I ever went to in my life I was a freshman in college. I don’t know

26

anything about football.” “Oh, that’s all right. You’ll make it okay.”
Well, in the meantime, the home ec teacher found out we were in the
building, and she happened to be a classmate of Marilyn’s in home ec at
Oklahoma A&M. So, she come back and caught me, said, “Is Marilyn
here?” “Yes, she’s out there in the car.” So, she shot out to the car,
visited with her, and she said, “Are you applying for a job here?” “Yes.”
There I was, she says, “You tell him to get in the car and get out of town
as quick as he can!” (Laughs)
I don’t remember that.
M. Jones
G. Jones

Well, yes, she said that. The superintendant was—he was almost nuts.
(Laughter) They didn’t offer me a job. Well, I wanted to have something
written, and so I went back and took the job at Ford. Then we went on
back to South Carolina to finish getting out. We went up to the door, our
door of our house, the phone was ringing. I got to the phone and it was
Johnson to offer me a contract. No one knew that we took the job at Ford
but that was fine, because it only lasted three or four years, and then it
died out there.
But we liked Ford. It turned out to be…

M. Jones

We were at Ford for three years, but it was small and declining. They
was consolidating and we thought we better look for something, of
course, that’s nicer.

G. Jones

M. Jones

People in western Kansas, at least at that point, were more progressive
probably, than like in this part of the world. But you thought nothing of
hopping in the car and going into Dodge City to get a loaf of bread.
Distance didn’t really mean anything in that era.
Well, how did you get to Peabody, Kansas? (Laughter)
Well, that’s…

Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones
M. Jones

Actually, the place out at Ford that we were, they were going to close
just any day.
We ended up looking for a job out there. We were out there three years,
and you could see consolidation coming. So, I looked for a job every
year for three years.

G. Jones
But it didn’t come, actually, for another ten. (Laughs)
M. Jones

Yes, but I was at an ag teachers conference in Manhattan in the
summertime. They have it in Oklahoma, too. All the ag teachers were in

27

G. Jones

Manhattan for their summer conference. I was eating supper at this little
ole restaurant down there close to the hotel, and here come all the
supervisors, including the director, over to me. I was sitting there having
supper. I thought, “What is going on?” They knew that I was looking for
a job. They said, “Would you be interested in going to Peabody?” I said,
“Peabody? Where in the world is that?” I had to come home and look it
up on the map to find out where it was at. They said they have an
opening. See, this was in June, and about all the teaching contracts are
over by June.
But anyway, this instructor had gotten a state job at Lee, and said, “It’s
opening up. They’ve got a relatively new building,” and said, “If you
want the job, we’ll kind of hold out the ones that we send down there
and see if you like it.” So, the Ford music teacher had driven up there.
He had his car there. I didn’t have a car, because I had ridden with the
Dodge City ag teacher. So, I went over and talked to this music teacher.
I said, “Could I borrow your car to go down to Peabody?” “Sure.”
So, I flew down here, and they had set up an interview. I interviewed
and they were ready to grab me, because there wasn’t anybody else out
there. They said, “You’ve got to be here on the first of July when your
contract starts.” Well, I called Marilyn to see if she was interested. We
hadn’t disposed of what we’d had out there. I’d had a tractor and some
stuff that I’d accumulated and stuff that we couldn’t move. I had to come
early, had to leave her and come here early to be here by the first of July,
because I had to be on the job. So, I brought an Army cot and I slept in
the office in the ag building up there for a week, waiting to get things
lined up.
And this was the only house available, the only one. There was one
north of town, but it had no water. And here we had a new baby by that
time.

M. Jones

G. Jones

This place had just come on the market and the guy’s dad had this farm
right over here. (Gestures) Had he known it’d been on the market, he’d
of grabbed it in a minute because he wanted to get out there closer to—
because he went by every day, going to work at his dad’s. We ended up
buying this place.
It had nine acres with it. It cost nine thousand dollars. We wondered how
we’d ever get it paid off. (Laughs)

M. Jones

Yes, that was like Fort Knox, nine thousand dollars.
Oh, yes.

G. Jones

28

Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones

We sold everything. I sold my tractor and everything out there, because I
had to come up with two thousand dollars for the down payment. We
finally got the two thousand dollars put together and bought this place.
The rest is history, I guess. (Laughs)
So, you spent thirty-three years working for the school, here?

Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones

Yes, yes. That’s almost unheard of anymore, because teachers come and
go. Two or three years and they’re gone down the road. In fact, I retired
in 1993, and they’ve had two, three, four—they’re on the fifth ag teacher
since ’93.
Wow.

Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones

They go through them. Well, last year, we got an Okie in here, and he
was real good. I thought, “Well…” Well, I retired in ’93 and some of my
teachers got me by the ear and said, “Why don’t you run for the school
board now that you’re not teaching and see what it’s like?” because there
was an opening. I stalled them off for a year or two. Come up for
election, I run for election on the school board and got on it. I found out
you have to die, then, to get off it. (Laughter) So I was on the school
board. But we’ve gone through like five ag teachers since I’ve retired.
We’ve got a new one this year. (Laughs) But it seems like teachers don’t
stay like they used to, regardless of who they are.
At least in agriculture. Grade school teachers tend to stay a long time.
Well, they stay forever. But high school teachers, they’re more volatile.

M. Jones
G. Jones

Well, with your finger on the pulse of agriculture, are you doing
anything interesting here? Are you raising anything interesting?

Nykolaiszyn

Well, we’ve raised sheep almost all the time we’ve been here.

G. Jones
M. Jones

We used to have as many as 250 until he retired and found out how
much work it was, because I have always farmed. And then we cut them
down, the flock, a lot. This year, we cut it due to the weather and old
age, I guess. But cut it way back. We don’t have any feed. We don’t
have any pasture. Gary was sick last winter, all winter, and so we just
cut down our share in numbers. Then we added goats over the years,
actually to start in to provide milk for the orphan lambs. And then we
kind of like goats really well. That works out pretty well for us. And
we’ve always gardened, and we had a greenhouse out in western Kansas.
It was just a small…

29

G. Jones

We moved the greenhouse back here, and so I’ve always had a
greenhouse business.

M. Jones

That was her occupation, because she never did teach. Well, we had a
daughter born when we was at Ford. So, then we had two youngsters.

G. Jones

I’ve always liked that if I had to go back, but I’d frankly rather mow
yards than be shut in a house and have to teach. (Laughs)

M. Jones

She would raise bedding plants and this kind of stuff. Peabody had no
greenhouse.

G. Jones

Made corsages for the high school things.

M. Jones

The business picked up pretty well, I mean, kept growing every year. In
fact, there for a while, she done floral corsage work, too, making
corsages for prom and that kind of stuff.

G. Jones

M. Jones

And somewhere along the line I learned to spin because we had a lady
here—not here, but in Hillsborough. Hillsborough had a lot of German
people that came and settled in this area because of the railroad and that
was something they did at home. We had all this wool and she showed
me how to spin. So, then for like twenty-five years, I taught spinning and
dying at the farm. That was a lot of fun. People would come and stay
here for a week. Then we developed a bed and breakfast across the field
over there. (Gestures) That was about the time…
And that’s not a lot of work.

Nykolaiszyn

It keeps you off the streets. (Laughter) We needed water down there for
the sheep, and so it paid for the water bill to have that old house down
there. So, that worked out pretty well.

M. Jones

G. Jones

Way back when, when she was teaching spinning she would like the
different fibers. So, we started collecting breeds of sheep as a hobby.
One time, we had twenty, thirty different breeds of sheep here just
because she liked this breed and this… And then we started developing
black sheep because black sheep is recessive to white sheep and it’s a
challenge to get them to turn black, to get them to turn coal black. You
can get some black ones and they have white spots on them. Well, that
didn’t count.
So, we got them where we could get them coal black, and we ran an ad
or two in National Magazine, “Long wool, black sheep.” Well, see,
nobody was pushing black sheep. That was a no-no. But we went ahead
and done that and got them where we could—we produced them about

30

95 percent of the time. The other 5 percent, they’d come up with a white
spot on top of their head and the tip of their tail would be white. Well,
the tail would be no problem because you could cut their tails off, but
they still had the white spot on top of their head.
Anyway, we would take a pickup load of two ewe lambs and one ram
lamb, that was the package, we’d load up—well, we’d have, during the
winter, we’d correspond and sell them to people back east. We would
deliver these black sheep back east. We done that for five or six years,
until I got tired of going down I-70. We’d deliver them as far as Bangor,
Maine. We sent some to Aruba one year. We’ll never do that again.
Also, we’ve had buyers here from Bakersfield, California that bought
black sheep. But we sold black sheep, then, for all the time that the
spinning craze was going on. But then it sort of took its course.

M. Jones

In the Main Street program, I don’t know if you’re familiar with that, but
to revitalize little towns in America, and it came to town in ’87, and so
we got busy helping with that, and that was the last year we taught
spinning.
We got very involved in that.

G. Jones

But we met a lot of wonderful people that were interested. They would
come and sometimes they would camp, pitch a tent around here. But
usually, they stayed someplace else.

M. Jones
We’ve had people from all over the world take spinning, including one
doctor from Dodge City that came here every year for twentysomething…
G. Jones
Twenty-five years.
M. Jones
G. Jones

He’d come every year. Wouldn’t learn anything, he’d just come to get
away from his practice.
Then about—how long have we been traveling, fifteen years, twenty
years? I watched my folks, they were always going to go take a trip and
they never did and they died.

M. Jones
My folks are about the same way.
G. Jones
M. Jones

So, we said, “That’s not going to happen.” So, and we started going on a
trip. And because we have livestock, you can’t go off and just leave
them. We had different people early on. And then for the past ten or
twelve years, we’ve had a good friend that worked for Gary when we
had a store downtown, and she just moves out here and takes care of

31

things. But we try and get it down to where it’s the least amount of work
possible, which is September and October for us.
You go everywhere? Do you go out of the country?
Oh, yes.
Nykolaiszyn
Out of the country we’ve traveled quite a bit.
G. Jones
I’ve been in all fifty states.
M. Jones
G. Jones

And some people think we’re absolutely crazy, but that’s the way we
spend…

M. Jones

That’s our hobby.

G. Jones

Last year we went to Ireland, but we’ve gone to Switzerland and Italy
and Iceland.

M. Jones

Guernsey Island, you ever been to Guernsey Island?
I have not.

G. Jones
Quite a few places.
Nykolaiszyn
M. Jones

Well, I always wanted to go to Guernsey Island because that’s the home
of the Guernsey cattle, and also, next to Guernsey Island is Jersey Island
where the Jerseys come from.

G. Jones

M. Jones

Then it just happened that these people came to town from Wichita and
he was from the Guernsey Island. They turned out to be good friends
now, and they helped us go and visit his folks and change currency. Oh,
they’re wonderful. But it was just a happen-so.
Well, about the time I’m getting ready to retire from here, I bought this
old derelict building downtown. There’s a lot of them down there. But I
bought it for what, fifteen thousand dollars?

G. Jones
Not very much.
M. Jones

And we rebuilt it and started an antique store. So, had an antique store in
there for twenty years just because I like old stuff.

G. Jones

But we knew nothing about running a business.
No. But anyway, this is where this couple come in and I thought he had

32

M. Jones

an English accent. I said, “You must be from English.” “No, I’m from
Guernsey.” I said, “Oh, we’re getting ready to go to Guernsey!”

G. Jones
Not at that point we hadn’t. We wanted to go there, but we didn’t know
anything about it.
M. Jones
G. Jones

So, they said, “We’re going”—this particular year that I talked about. I
said, “We’re going to go at such and such time.” He said, “We’re going
to be there at that time vacationing, too.” And they met us at the airport,
showed us around Guernsey. Now, Guernsey Island, you think you can’t
get lost on an island, but I got news for you. When the Germans—the
Germans occupied that during World War II, and the native people
didn’t like them. They took down all the street signs, and they never
have got around to put them back up. Well, you can get lost. One time,
we spent four hours trying to find a place and come to find out, we was
just three blocks from where we stood. You just kind of go round and
round. The streets, there’s no rhyme or reason. The streets were real
narrow, too. We got out there one time to show people, going to take a
picture of how narrow the streets were. We held our hands out, like this.
(Gestures) She was over there and I was over here, and we touched both
sides of the road. And on the sides of the road was rock wall. With a
rental car, you’ll be real careful. (Laughs)
Oh, yes.
You hit that rock wall and you pay dearly.

Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones

Then about, I don’t know, twelve years ago, maybe—let’s see. Okay,
about that time—Gary has a cousin who’s never married. She’s a lab
technician…

M. Jones
I call her my “ole maid.”
G. Jones
M. Jones

…at a VA hospital in Muskogee, Oklahoma, but she spent a lot of years
back in New York. Anyhow, we got the idea—she was actually born the
same year we were married, so she’s sixty-one. But asked her if she’d
like to travel with us, that’s when we were going to Switzerland.
She didn’t have any…

G. Jones
M. Jones

She has a sister, but as far as I know, she had never traveled much
before. She wasn’t really close to somebody else, you know. So,
anyhow, now she’s kind of like our daughter. She takes care—she drives
anymore, that sort of thing. But anyhow, we went to Switzerland. Well,
that time she showed up with five suitcases. (Laughter) To her credit,
she’s never done it again, but it was pretty dreadful.

33

Because she had to handle them all. I didn’t handle them.
But she still takes more than I think she needs.
G. Jones
She’s down to one suitcase now.
M. Jones
G. Jones
M. Jones

But anyhow, and then about the time—when she turned fifty, I guess,
you can go to elder hostile stuff, so we found some things that sounded
interesting and the elder hostile classes—I don’t know if you know
anything about them, but it’s a national organization. You can go and
they have everything arranged. It’s usually through some local college.
We’re going to go to one, actually, next week. The end of Wisconsin,
the Apostle Isles…
Clear up there on Lake Superior, as far up as you can get.
Somehow, Alda likes lighthouses so there’s some lighthouses.

G. Jones
I wanted to see a cranberry bog because I’ve never seen one before.
M. Jones
What else?
G. Jones
Plus, take in the cheese factories, too. (Laughs)
M. Jones
Right, exactly.
G. Jones
Nykolaiszyn

So, that’s our biggy for this year. That’s not overseas, but we went to
Ireland last year and actually, we got so tired of sitting for so long. It
was miserable.

M. Jones
On the airplane.
It was like seven hours of…
G. Jones
They shove you in there like a bunch of hogs.
M. Jones
G. Jones
M. Jones

If you could ever afford to go first class, that might be better. I don’t
know. (Laughs) We’ve traveled quite a lot in the recent years and met
the nicest people. The people always say, “Aren’t you scared or
worried?” But dogs, I really love animals, dogs, and I’ve met the nicest
dogs all around the world. That’s always a conversational piece no
matter where you are. (Laughs)
Some people spend all their time and money bowling or golf…

34

Right.
G. Jones
Nykolaiszyn

Ours is traveling. Generally, we go in September or the first of October
for several reasons. One of them is…

G. Jones

We told her about that.

M. Jones

Oh, the little kids are in school and it’s cooler. So, we always go about
then, and it’s worked out pretty well for us. We’ve gone all over.

G. Jones

We don’t ever go any place that’s hot. (Laughs)
That’s a smart thing to do.

M. Jones
Oh, these past two years have been horrible! (Laughs)
Nykolaiszyn
We did take off and go to Chile once.
M. Jones
But that was in the winter. That was early.
G. Jones
That was in the first of December.
M. Jones
G. Jones
M. Jones

That was a mistake on our part, which we never thought of because the
same gal came out and took care of things. But we didn’t think about
things freezing here, like the hoses freezing up. We never thought to tell
her to drain the hoses. Of course, then she had to do a lot more work
outside because things froze. We’ll never do that again, but that was our
own stupidity. But it was nice for us to travel before the changes
reversed and everything.
And Chile, we’re going to see a lot more of Chile producing our fruits
and vegetables for us, because Californians are big into condos and fruit
farms. (Laughs)

G. Jones

Nykolaiszyn

Well, you mentioned you bought an old building downtown. I noticed
that your daughter put on the directions that y’all were pretty active in
getting some of the buildings downtown on the register, national
register.
Yes, she done that.

G. Jones
M. Jones

Yes, the historical society—actually, I don’t know how I got particularly
started in it, except they asked me to plant the planters uptown in front
of the museum. When the kids were little, I really didn’t do that much in
it in the first few years. But since then, I’ve done a lot with it and put up
stuff for people, that sort of thing.

35

G. Jones

Some of these old buildings had gotten in pretty bad shape, and I was
teaching at the time. The band teacher had become the real estate person
in town as his part-time job. He got a hold of this old building, one of
many old building down there. He said, “How about selling you this old
building, Jones? It’s a bargain.” I thought, “Uh, not for me.” So, they’d
bought it to keep—there was a junk dealer wanting to buy it to just put
junk in. Anyway, in one of my weaker moments, I went down with him
to look at it, and I visualized what you could do with it. We had no idea
what we was going to do with it at the time. But for fifteen hundred
dollars, that’s what I gave to buy the business. The stone building, nice
building, two-story building, so I bought the thing.
I went down to survey what I’d bought, went in there right after a rain
storm and there was fifty-two five-gallon buckets under drips. The
ceiling just leaked like a sieve. There was this much water on the floor.
(Gestures) I thought, “Oh, boy.” So, the first thing we done was hire a
roofer for six thousand dollars to put a roof on the thing. (Laughs) He
told us to clean it clear off, but I knew we had to get it stabilized before
we could do anything. And we did. Then we started painting. It hadn’t
been painted for years. It was an old grocery store, and they used to
slaughter in the back room for this meat market.
It was a beer joint, too.
Oh.

M. Jones
Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones

So, anyway, we started donning it out, painting it, got to where I was
painting the walls one time and putting it on just pretty heavy. I’d work
down there of an evening after—I was still teaching school at that time.
I’d come home and it wasn’t how much you got painted, it was how
much paint did you use up. If you didn’t use up a gallon of paint, you
just didn’t do much. (Laughs) But anyway, we got that done and we
decided to go into an antique business, because I always liked to go to
farm auctions and this kind of stuff. I sort of specialized in old
agriculture stuff and furniture went with it. We run that antique store
down there for twenty years.
But in ’87, that was when the Main Street program came, and we did do
a lot and Main Street looked really good then for a while.

M. Jones

Every building was full.

G. Jones

Now, it’s going back down here. But we had Baker Furniture here in
town, and they had like eleven buildings downtown. Well, about three
years ago now, they decided—the big problem was Highway 51 decided

36

M. Jones

to go around—the State Department of Highway Transportation sent
Highway 50 around instead of going through the north side of town. It’s
much more convenient for traffic, but it was a killer as far as the town
was concerned. So, there went all the traffic we had worked hard to get
downtown. It literally, killed the town. Well, then Baker decided to
move out and move to Newton. Now, we’ve got empty buildings again
and lots of them, and he didn’t take very good care of the buildings. So,
now, we still have the Main Street program or we wouldn’t be here at
all. They have purchased buildings, and they’re trying to get roofs back
on and attract some businesses to come in. But who really wants to come
in?
The economy is not great.
Right.

G. Jones
Nykolaiszyn

What are you going to bring in that can survive here? It’s easy to run to
Newton. My pet peeve is people run to Dillons or wherever it takes to
get their groceries and don’t support their local businesses. (Laughs)

M. Jones

G. Jones

I need to back up. I was teaching. They always encourage you to get
your master’s. Also, you looked to salary schedule and that’s the only
way you could get a decent raise was to get your master’s. So, I started
going to K-State in the summertime to get my master’s, and I spent six
summers taking classes up there. Of course, they used to rag me all the
time, being an Oklahoma graduate. They kept saying, “Why don’t you
wear a K-State hat?” I said, “I don’t wear those things,” because a lot of
the teachers were K-State graduates. I said, “Well, yes, I graduated from
K-State and Oklahoma State, too, so I got dual allegiance.”
One year, he went to Illinois to work on his master’s one summer, and
the music teacher and I built that barn out there that summer. We’ll take
you out there pretty soon.

M. Jones

Nykolaiszyn

We notice graduates from Oklahoma State, Oklahoma A&M, have this
intense loyalty to their school. It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen.
(Laughter) Why do you think that Oklahoma State graduates have this
loyalty towards the school?
I don’t know.

G. Jones
M. Jones

I don’t know, but I’ve noticed the same thing. It’s much more intense
than most places I’ve been.
Well, now, in Kansas, the same thing is with K-State. They’re really
loyal. I know we’ve got a principal up here, I always used to goose him

37

having purple shorts because he was so loyal to K-State.
G. Jones
I think K-State and KU are, but you don’t hear it about the other,
Wichita State or…
M. Jones

Emporia, yes.

M. Jones

Well, I suppose they’re smaller, too, so that probably makes a
difference. The kids all have degrees from K-State. Our daughter-in-law
and our son-in-law graduated from there, too. In fact, Lynn has her
master’s from K-State.

G. Jones

Our son, he graduated from vet school, which took him nine years to get
through that. But he’s practicing veterinary medicine in northern Kansas.
And then Lynn, her husband, both work now for Oklahoma State.
They’re not teachers…

Nykolaiszyn

Have you met Lynn, actually?
I have not.
M. Jones
Oh, okay. Well, I thought she said she really didn’t know you.
Nykolaiszyn
She works over in the…
M. Jones
Fire protection.
G. Jones
Yes.
Nykolaiszyn
M. Jones

Yes. And then our son-in-law does nothing but lay carpet all over the
campus. He’s a carpet layer.

G. Jones

But he actually has a degree in hotel and restaurant administration.
(Laughs)

M. Jones

Yes, from Kansas State. He’s an avid K-State fan.

G. Jones

I don’t know if this is of any interest to you in the slightest, but I did dig
out…

M. Jones

Oh, your old Redskin.
Under the bed, yes. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn
It’s been there forever.
M. Jones

38

G. Jones

It was bad, it probably still is, but anyhow I dug that out and Lynn found
our picture. I think she said they don’t even put these out anymore.

M. Jones

They do not.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay. Well, when we were there, if you didn’t pay to get in it, you
didn’t get in it. So, the lady I worked for paid…

M. Jones

If you didn’t buy a book...
…paid to get us in there so that’s the only reason we’re in there.

G. Jones
M. Jones

Do you have any, as we wind down, any memories about your time in
college that are just real special to you?

Nykolaiszyn

Not particularly.
We got through it.

G. Jones
Got through it. It’s a good thing.
M. Jones
Nykolaiszyn

At that point, I don’t know that anybody from Dexter High School ever
went to college. They did afterward, but…

M. Jones

Yes, there was a few of them after, later, but nobody green out of high
school went.

G. Jones

Everybody tells me we were absolutely crazy.

M. Jones

Of course, I look back at Dexter, it’s kind of an economically deprived
area.

G. Jones

It probably was at the time, but we didn’t know it.
We didn’t know it.

M. Jones
It’s typical of the time. “We were all poor, we didn’t know it.”
G. Jones
That’s right. (Laughs)
Nykolaiszyn
Everybody was the same way.
G. Jones
Yes.
M. Jones
Nykolaiszyn

And as far as the Vet Village part, I think now, if it’d been bigger, more
to take care of, you wouldn’t have managed it. We couldn’t have

39

afforded it.
M. Jones
Now, our son got married when he went into vet school, and they lived
in the married apartments up there. They are plush.
G. Jones

Yes, times have changed.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, they’re plush now, but they were much better than the house we
were in. (Laughs)

M. Jones

Much better than this. (Gestures) But this is all they had.

G. Jones

For a long time there was one of these left over at Newton. It’s not there
anymore, but…

M. Jones

I tried to buy one, one time, just for keepsake. But they wanted a fortune
for the thing.

G. Jones

Lynn and I were just talking, particularly me, the older you get, the
smaller I like the house to be. (Laughs) I can’t remember the man’s
name, but he does a series on tiny houses. They’re really tiny, too, and
we don’t really need all this stuff around here. That’s for sure. And we
certainly didn’t have here, but…

M. Jones

I don’t know whether you can see the—that’s the layout of the house.
(Gestures)
G. Jones

Well, it’s simply one door at the front, which you can see on here.
(Gestures) It had these windows, and they cranked out from the bottom
and cranked out sideways.

M. Jones
Today, you’d have to have two doors on account of fire.
I wonder how they named the streets.
G. Jones
Nykolaiszyn

Le De Sud was French, but don’t ask—what does that mean, if you
speak French?

M. Jones

No idea, but it’s something to look into.

Nykolaiszyn

I think maybe, see, being in Vet’s Village—and I suspect at one time the
vets had a hand in naming the streets.

G. Jones

Excuse me a second. I’ll call our local veterinarian who has a degree in
French. (Laughs)

40

M. Jones

I got a feeling maybe they had a hand in naming the streets because they
were in from all over. We got in on the tail end of the veterans coming in
there, and they were taking any married students that would come in.

G. Jones
Were they starting to dismantle the housing units while you were still
there?
Nykolaiszyn
G. Jones

Yes, there were some areas that were just vacant. There were some there,
all that was there was the foundations. Well, these houses didn’t have a
foundation. They had four poles set in the ground. That was the
foundation. Then they had the concrete floor in the house, and later on,
they black-topped the streets. The streets were black-topped when we
went there. But in reading history, they were mud streets for years, but
they black-topped and then they made a concrete walk up there with a
stick. Now, we had a small picket fence, about this tall, around here,
especially when we had our bulldog because you can let them out.
Bulldogs couldn’t jump over that little fence. So, in fact, somebody stole
one of our bulldog pups one time.
Really?

Nykolaiszyn

Yes. That’s when I was in ROTC camp in Benning in the summertime.
Our ole bulldog had two pups. One of them was a nice pup, the other
one, he wasn’t much good. But they stole the good one.

G. Jones
She didn’t know. She said it means, “The street of…” whatever S-UD… (Laughter) I don’t know the answer to that.
M. Jones

I’ll just have to ask our campus historian…
It’s D-U S-U-D.

Nykolaiszyn
It’s two separate words.
G. Jones
M. Jones

Well, is there anything else you’d like to add before we close her on out,
today? Anything else you’d like to share?

Nykolaiszyn

I think we’ve about run through the gamut. (Laughter)
I think I’ve covered it from A to Z. (Laughter) Well, thank you so much.

G. Jones
