About Gay Lynn Bullock…
Gay Lynn Bullock is part of a rare Oklahoma State University occurrence: She comes from
a family with five generations of OSU scholars. Her great-grandparents instilled in their
family the importance of education, and as a result, her grandmother started the OSU
tradition, majoring in education and teaching school for several years of her life. Growing
up, Gay Lynn enjoyed spending time on her grandparents’ farm and going to OSU sporting
events with her father. After she graduated from Stillwater High School in 1959, she
enrolled at OSU majoring in business, at her father’s advising. Not quite ready to fully
commit to college just yet, she took some time off to start a family and moved to Texas,
occasionally taking classes when time allowed.
Ultimately coming back to Oklahoma with her growing family, Gay Lynn eventually
completed a marketing degree at the University of Central Oklahoma, but her heart
remained with OSU. Even with a non-OSU degree, the educational and social foundation
obtained here still plays a big part in her life. She and her husband make sure to get season
tickets for OSU events, and she keeps in touch with friends she made when she was a
student here. The family tradition continues, and Gay Lynn still cherishes the aesthetic
beauty, the academic excellence, and the warmth of the people of OSU. She and her
husband are retired and live in Stillwater.

Gay Lynn Bullock
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Jerry Gill
August 25, 2010
Stillwater, Oklahoma
Gill

My name is Jerry Gill. Today is August 25, 2010. I’m visiting with Gay
Lynn Bullock in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the OSTATE Stories project in the Oklahoma Oral History Research
Program. I appreciate you taking time this afternoon to visit with us.

Bullock

You’re welcome.

Gill

Gay Lynn, your family has a proud history of Oklahoma A&M and
Oklahoma State University beginning with your grandmother, Gay Ione
Albright Clark, continuing through your mother, and five generations of
your family have attended Oklahoma State University. I understand your
grandson Matthew is currently a student at Oklahoma State.

Bullock

Yes. He’s a junior this year in architectural engineering.

Gill

You’ve got to be proud of that young man.

Bullock

Yes!

Gill

That’s great.

Bullock

He’s doing well.

Gill

Was your grandmother still living while you were a little girl?

Bullock

Oh, yes. She lived to be ninety-four.

Gill

When you think back, what do you remember about your grandmother?

4

Bullock

Oh, gosh! We would go to their farm, and I would climb in the orchard
and eat cherries right out of the tree. We would spend the night. They
had an outhouse. Of course, I wouldn’t go out there. But anyway, she
was full of stories and very dramatic. Grandpa was very quiet, and she
went on and on. She was a lot of fun. We’d go down to the pond, go get
in the watermelon patch, and it was great. There was just fruit,
cantaloupe, strawberries, and everything out there. We went out there
quite a bit. I thoroughly enjoyed the farm because we lived in town all
that time.

Gill

What do you remember about her personality? Was she pretty perky?

Bullock

Oh, she was so outgoing. She was a ham. She was a frustrated actress.
She would love to get up in front of people and give speeches. She
taught Sunday school. Any time she had a chance to get up in front of
people—and this has kind of filtered down to all of us, clear down to my
son, Michael, who is a big time comedian. (Laughs) Grandma was very
outgoing, very helpful. She was an Eastern Star. She was a Worthy
Matron. She went really far in that organization. She just liked to get up
and be in front of people and talk, and really loved people. Everybody
liked her. She was very prominent there in Perkins.

Gill

Did she ever talk to you about any of her OSU experiences?

Bullock

The only thing I remember, there weren’t hardly any buildings there, but
she enjoyed the classes, and she made a lot of friends when she was
there. I’m not sure where she stayed. I can’t remember that. She really
didn’t talk a lot about that, but she did enjoy it. She would talk about
what a great school that was and how she thought all of her children
should go, and everybody else in the family should go to that particular
school. She was real proud of the fact that she had been there.

Gill

It was pretty special. We’re talking back in the nineteen-teens. For a
woman to go to college at that time was pretty special, wasn’t it?

Bullock

It was a little bitty place. I’m sure it was Old Central and…

Gill

Morrill Hall, maybe?

Bullock

I don’t know how many would be that old there. She loved her classes.
Everywhere she went she made a lot of friends. Of course, they called on
her all the time because she liked to talk. (Laughs)

Gill

She graduated in Education?

Bullock

Education.

5

Gill

And then taught most of her life?

Bullock

Taught in Perkins and a couple other places they lived while he was
working for the railroad. Then she came back to Perkins. They had a
piece of land and they started farming, and then she raised her kids. She
didn’t teach anymore. So, I’ve often wondered why she just didn’t keep
on teaching, but apparently living out like that, that would’ve been [a
challenge].

Gill

She has a couple other sisters that attended OSU.

Bullock

Yes. They had two families. They had this one—the three or four older
kids, and then when Mom was born, they had two more. So, her aunts
were her same age. She ran around with her aunts, and it was Geneva
and Iris. There was another son that was maybe five or ten years older.
Over a span of twenty-one years, they had kids. They stopped for a
while and then had some more. (Laughter) Then when they grew up,
Mom, there she was. She had built-in friends to run around with.

Gill

How many of the kids in her family went to college?

Bullock

Geneva and Iris, Arnold, Massey did not go, Mark, Edwin was a farmer.
He took over the farm. He was a very big farmer so, I don’t think Edwin
went. But Mark, I think, he was in sales. So, he may or may not have. I
never heard. Arnold went, but I’m not sure where he went. He went into
the army. He was a colonel, and retired army.

Gill

But it was pretty unusual at that time, for two or three members of the
same family to go to college.

Bullock

Yes. They were very big on education. That was talked about a lot. They
read a lot. Great-Grandpa Albright really stressed education. He was a
hearty German guy. “You’ve got to learn!” He had a very successful
farm, but he did stress that education was always a choice, just like that
filtered down to everybody.

Gill

So, it continued then with your mother?

Bullock

Yes.

Gill

She attended Oklahoma A&M.

Bullock

And Grandma and Mom. Now, Harry, her brother, didn’t go. He stayed
and worked in Perkins. She was disappointed, but he made his choice.

6

Gill

Did your mother ever take you to any OSU activities, sporting events, or
reunions, Homecoming, or anything?

Bullock

I think Dad may have taken us. Mom, she was off with her book clubs,
her literary [group], her music club, and much more cultural, but Dad
was sporty. He took us to some basketball. I think he probably took us to
wrestling. I was very athletic. My older brother was not, even though he
played football because his dad thought that was cool. But I was more
athletic. I was the most athletic in the family, the girl.

Gill

Did you play basketball?

Bullock

I played softball. I always wanted to play sports, and there wasn’t
anything for girls at that particular time. So, I asked the guys if I could
play baseball, or softball and they said, “Go away! Go away, Gay Lynn!
Go away.” I tried to play a little basketball, but I was so short. I played
tennis. I started taking up tennis. I really love athletics. My younger
brother plays a mean game of golf, but I probably was the most all
around.

Gill

So, how many brothers and sisters do you have?

Bullock

I have two brothers, one older and one younger.

Gill

Now, where did you live growing up? Some different communities?

Bullock

We lived on 301 South Duncan. I remember that house. I went to
Norwood, if you remember that little school that’s now the DeMolay and
Masonic [Lodge]. It was a little school.

Gill

What was the name of the school then?

Bullock

It was Norwood, on Miller and Duck. There were a bunch of us in this
neighborhood that went to this little school. That was just the first grade.
Then I went to Jefferson. When we lived on Duncan, I went to Jefferson.
Then we moved out to Admiral Road. Dad said we needed to move out
to a better neighborhood.

Gill

Where was that?

Bullock

Western, out west, Admiral, Sherwood, University, all those. So, we
moved out to Admiral Road, and then I started going to Eugene Field,
which is where IGA Consumers [grocery store] is now, [on Sixth and
Washington]. There was a school there. So, I went there. Eugene Field
was there for several years.

7

There are several Stillwater High people that stay around. There are
several in my class, the class before, they just stay here. I’m not sure
what they all do, but they stay here. (Laughs) Let’s see, where’d we go?
That’s when we went to Texas. Dad was transferred. Then we came back
and lived on Sherwood.
Gill

And then you…

Bullock

Went to high school and finished up high school.

Gill

So, you went to Stillwater High School?

Bullock

Yes.

Gill

What activities were you involved in?

Bullock

Probably Junior Dramatics, like everybody else in this family. I sang in
the choir. I don’t think there were any sports that I did. Basketball was
the main thing, and I was just not a basketball player, even though I love
it here. We’ve got season tickets to everything.

Gill

That’s great.

Bullock

I don’t remember. I think I was in some social clubs, but I can’t
remember all those.

Gill

So, what year did you graduate from Stillwater High School?

Bullock

Fifty-nine.

Gill

Fifty-nine? So, then you enrolled in Oklahoma State that fall?

Bullock

Right.

Gill

What was your major?

Bullock

Business. Now, this story is, I wanted to be in theater and dramatics and
Dad says, “That’s not practical. You need to be in business.”

Gill

Your dad said you need to be in business?

Bullock

Yes, I needed to be in business, accounting or something like that.
(Laughter) I said, “I don’t like that, Dad.” He said, “Well, I think that’s a
good idea.” (Laughter)

Gill

Since he was paying the tuition.

8

Bullock

“Well, what are you going to do?” I really wanted to live on the campus.
I wanted to get in everything and run around on the campus. He said,
“You have a perfectly nice home to stay in.” I’m going, “Oh, gosh!” So,
I went and I was in business. I didn’t particularly like it, so I went to all
the parties, all the fraternity parties. I danced at the Student Union like
Mom, and at the end of the year my grade point was about 1.9, I think.
He says, “I don’t believe you’re grown up enough to keep going to
college. You’re going to have to work, Gay Lynn.” (Laughs) I said,
“Well, I didn’t like business, Dad.” So, I went to work for a while, and
then I got back in college. Then I met my first husband. He was from
Sapulpa. He was a Beta up here. We got married, had four kids.

Gill

What did you finally major in, get your degree in?

Bullock

Well, I didn’t finish then. I got married and had kids.

Gill

Oh, then you came back.

Bullock

Then I started going back to school. Then I was in marketing. I said, “Do
I want to be in marketing? What do I want to do? What will get me a
job?” I thought at that point, theater and all that stuff was not going to
get me a job. (Laughs) I was past the starlet era. I went off and we lived
in Texas a lot. He was with oil companies. So, I would pick up an hour
here, pick up an hour here, pick up an hour here, you know, and go. I
even went to Kilgore College and lived in Longview, Texas, and went to
Kilgore College. I thought just one moment about being a Rangerette,
but I was too old. (Laughter)

Gill

So, you talked about the good time you had your freshman year.
(Laughter) Were you in some organizations, some activities?

Bullock

I was not. I was sort of a rebel without a cause, at that point. I did not
join a sorority, even though several called me and asked me and
everything. I said, “No.” That might’ve been good for me if I’d have
done that, but I don’t know. I was in the Speech Club. I managed to get
into some of the dramatic clubs even though I was a business major
(Laughs) because I enjoyed that kind of people, those kinds of kids.

Gill

Who was your president at that time at Oklahoma State? Was it Oliver
S. Willham, Dr. Willham?

Bullock

I bet that was.

Gill

You were there in the late…

9

Bullock

Do you remember Dean Swearingen?

Gill

Yes.

Bullock

He was the dean so, I don’t know. That might give you an idea of who
might be the president. It wasn’t Kamm. That was later.

Gill

You were talking about your dean. Are there other professors that you
remember at OSU at that time?

Bullock

Dr. Shauer. He taught me accounting. He was so good. He’s a good
accountant. He’s a good teacher, and that’s how I met my first husband.
He was taking it. Alphabetically, his name was Donovan. Dunn,
Donovan so, we sat by each other. He was really tough. Of course, he
played golf with my dad. He said, “Is your dad Warren?” He asked me
that, and I said, “Will that get me a good grade or…?” (Laughter) I don’t
know, but I remember Shauer. Of course, Dean Swearingen, I really
liked him. I had [Dr. Tewell] for speech I really liked. His son is a pro
golfer.

Gill

Do you remember who the Dean of Women was at that time? Was Zelma
Patchin the Dean of Women?

Bullock

Yes, yes. I remember that. Oh, what was her name? You know who that
is. Oh, gosh! I can’t remember, but I can see her. That’s too bad. I can’t
remember.

Gill

In the late fifties, early sixties when you were going to school, what were
some of the favorite student hangouts at that time?

Bullock

I don’t think Eskimo Joe’s had started.

Gill

They opened in ’57, I think.

Bullock

Maybe that was it. Well, the Student Union. I was at the Student Union a
lot. There were a lot of bars around. I’m trying to remember the places. I
danced at the Student Union.

Gill

They had a lot of dances there in the ballroom [on the fourth floor]?

Bullock

I went to the fraternity dances, liked a lot of those.

Gill

Oh, you went to the fraternity house parties. (Laughter)

Bullock

My dad said, “I’m taking the phone off that hook! I’m taking that phone
out of here. It’s always ringing!” (Laughter) “Is anyone going to a

10

dance?” I’m trying to think of some really good memories. I thoroughly
enjoyed myself.
Gill

Did you ever find the library while you were here?

Bullock

Yes, I used the library as a way to get out of the house sometimes. “I
have to go study at the library,” and then I’d go do something else.

Gill

Did they have some rules about what you could wear in the library at
that time?

Bullock

Yes. You had to wear long pants.

Gill

You had to wear dresses, didn’t you?

Bullock

I don’t think I had to wear dresses. We wore jeans and pants.

Gill

But you couldn’t wear shorts?

Bullock

We wore skirts and sweaters, but I’m trying to remember what—and my
dad let me drive. Oh, that’s another funny thing. He got this old Buick
Roadster. It was black and orange, and he always knew where I was.
Dad’s very sneaky. I’d drive around, and people would say, “Have you
seen Gay Lynn?” “Oh, yes. Her car is over there. Her car’s over there.
Her car’s over there.” (Laughter) I couldn’t hide from anything!

Gill

Describe the car to me.

Bullock

Orange and black. (Laughter)

Gill

Orange and black? Was it primarily black with a little orange, or vice
versa?

Bullock

Can you remember that car, Mom? The bottom was orange and the top
was black. It was that old Roadster. I could get twelve kids in there.
(Laughter) I mean, it was this far, the back seat in there. That was one of
those, “How many kids can you get in this car?” I had a very good time,
but I had to grow up a little.

Gill

You talked about the parties but maybe in addition to that, what were
some of your favorite memories of your times at OSU?

Bullock

I met a lot of girls that did not go to Stillwater High, and made a lot of
friends that were different because I was up at the dorm all the time,
because that’s where I wanted to live. (Laughs) So, that was fun, to meet
people from different cities. Of course, some of the classes, I really,

11

really liked. I had sociology, psychology. I had sociology with Moe Iba.
Gill

Moe Iba?

Bullock

Well, of course, I knew him when I went to Stillwater High, and he says,
“Gay Lynn, do you want to pass this test?” I said, “Do you have to have
all the tests?” I didn’t say that! (Laughter) But anyway, he was so much
fun. I enjoyed that class. Of course, I always enjoyed all the dances and
the parties. Those were fun.

Gill

Your older brother went to Oklahoma State?

Bullock

He finished at Oklahoma State, got a master’s, did some TA [teaching
assistant] work here, taught. Then, he finished his master’s and went
over at Tulsa and worked for DX Sunray, putting out their magazine or
something. He’s done quite well. He was just back here recently. He’s
lived away, Virginia, D.C. He was in D.C. a long time, worked in D.C. I
told him he was just corrupt, but yes, he’s done well. (Laughter)

Gill

Gay Lynn, you talked a little bit about how you didn’t finish your degree
before you got married and left. Can you talk a little bit about your life
from there to when you came back to Stillwater?

Bullock

All that life before I came back and tried to finish? (Laughs)

Gill

Just sort of fill in a little bit, like after you left OSU.

Bullock

We lived in Odessa, Texas. He worked for Sinclair Oil. My first child
was born in Sapulpa, Oklahoma, when we were there. Then the other
two girls were born in Odessa. I did a lot of volunteer work, charity
work, church work. I was very busy, very busy. I was not a stay-at-home
mom. I was, but I wasn’t. Then we moved to Longview, continued with
the East Texas Oil Field. I was president of several clubs, worthwhile
projects, played tennis, would come back for Homecoming. I came back
quite a few times. Of course, he was a big-time Beta. He would come
back to the Beta House and we’d see everybody. We’d come back to
Stillwater quite a bit. Of course, my parents were living here. Anyway, I
did a lot of fundraising for different organizations, for different kinds of
projects. Then he got a different job and we were supposed to move to
Tulsa, but we ended up moving to Sapulpa. Then in ’83, we were
divorced, and I came back to Stillwater to finish school.

Gill

So, you came back to Stillwater after that, then?

Bullock

I was going to school at the time my second was going to OSU. My first
one was out in ’85. Three of them were chemical engineers, and one of

12

them was a computer science major. Jamie and James Horning were out.
Then, I went and was still going when the third one entered. The two
younger ones graduated from Texas A&M.
Gill

Two of them went to Texas A&M? Your two oldest? Your daughter went
to Oklahoma State in the two years…

Bullock

That’s because we were there, but then he, the ex, was transferred to
Houston, and he wanted his kids somewhere down there by him. “If you
want me to pay for it, then come down and go to school.” That’s fine.
Texas A&M is a great school. But anyway, two of them did.

Gill

Looking back and reflecting on it, how did your time at Oklahoma State
University influence you and your life?

Bullock

Well, I met a lot of people I kept in touch with that are lifetime friends.
Some of the classes I thoroughly enjoyed. I was a late bloomer, and it
was a growing process. I went and was out for a while, and worked.
Then I went back, and then got married. I grew up during that time.

Gill

Did you ever finish your college degree?

Bullock

What happened is I came back here, I was about finished, and I married
my second husband, and he got a job at Tinker. He was teaching school.
He went to work for Tinker, and he was commuting. It was wearing him
out. So, I had to end up going to Edmond and graduating from the
University of Central Oklahoma, two semesters.

Gill

You got your degree, that’s important.

Bullock

I went, “Oh! I want to graduate from Oklahoma State!” But, I felt so bad
about him commuting every day, I just had to do that.

Gill

Sure.

Bullock

I still feel kind of like I did graduate from here. I got it anyway.

Gill

Your first two kids, particularly your daughter, did you have some
influence on their coming to Oklahoma State?

Bullock

Yes. I used to rock them, and tell them, “You’re going to school! You’re
going to go to school. You’re going to make your own way. You don’t
have to [depend] on a man.” This is a baby we’re talking to, you know.
“You must go to Oklahoma State and have a good degree.” Of course,
their dad said, “If it’s not science or math, I’m not paying for it.” I
thought, “That’s not quite right,” but actually it worked out because they

13

all have great jobs, and they’ve never been laid off, and they still have
them. (Laughs)
Gill

That’s true.

Bullock

So, that worked out.

Gill

Wow, five generations in one family. As I recall, there is a handful of
other five generation families, but nobody more than that at Oklahoma
State. Is that special to you? Is that a source of pride for you?

Bullock

Oh, yes! We talk about that all the time. In fact, when Matthew got here
his first week, we took a picture of me, Mom, Jamie, my daughter, and
him, when they brought him back and put him in Bennett Hall. I looked
and looked for that picture, but we had that picture. That was so great!
Jamie, my daughter, said, “Now, you must call the Stillwater NewsPress
and tell them about this.” Of course, she’s very good at telling me what
to do, and I said, “Well, I think I will,” and I never got around to it. How
did you find out about us, by the way?

Gill

Your daughter sent an email to me. We send out a newsletter. The
Alumni Association electronic newsletter went out asking about…

Bullock

Jamie Horning sent you.

Gill

Yes, she said, “You should talk to my mom in Stillwater.” (Laughs) So,
you can blame her, huh?

Bullock

She did it! That’s all right. I don’t care. I think that’s great. Now we’re
retired back here. Of course, Marty, my husband, finished here at OSU
and he loves it. Now that we’re back, we’ve tried to get involved in a lot
of things, OLLI [Osher Lifelong Learning Institute] and [Emeriti]. Of
course, we have season tickets to everything.

Gill

How long have you been back in Stillwater now?

Bullock

April 2008. It hasn’t been very long.

Gill

Well, getting back, that’s good.

Bullock

He retired in the fall of 2007 from Tinker, and we were in Oklahoma
City for just a short time for him to do that. We sold that place and
moved. In the first week I got back classmates said, “Gay Lynn, you
need to help us with our high school reunion, fiftieth.”

Gill

Fiftieth reunion, oh, no!

14

Bullock

I said, “I’ve just been here a week. I haven’t unpacked all my boxes.”
They said, “That’s okay, you can do it.” So, I worked on that all year,
and we had it, and it was great.

Gill

That’s good. You were talking earlier about how your family gets
together occasionally, informally.

Bullock

Yes.

Gill

Do you talk about some of your OSU experiences?

Bullock

Jamie had a lot of fun experiences here. She would be a great one to talk
to.

Gill

Named after her grandmother?

Bullock

Yes.

Gill

Let me ask you a couple of questions about that. Are there some
common experiences that you talk about? You know, do you say, “Oh,
yes, we did that,” or, “We did that.” Are there some common
experiences you shared that were similar in each generation?

Bullock

Well, we were talking about Eskimo Joe’s. They did a lot more of that.
There was a bar, George’s—some kind of bar that they may have gone
in that my husband went in.

Gill

George’s Stable?

Bullock

George’s Stable, yes.

Gill

Don’t ask me how I know that name. (Laughter)

Bullock

Of course, they liked the basketball when they were here, and we talk
about that a lot because James played basketball in high school. He’s a
very tall fellow. They are all very athletic, and I’m trying to get my
granddaughter up here, Matthew’s sister. She’s seventeen. She came up
to the OSU soccer camp this summer.

Gill

Where does she go to school?

Bullock

She goes to Beaumont, Texas. That’s where Matthew is from and Jamie.
That’s where they live. I was trying to talk her into that. “I don’t know.
My friends are going here.” You know how girls are. They kind of go
where their friends go. I hope she thinks about it this time.

15

Gill

We talked about the common experiences that you’ve shared, the
athletics, and different things. What do you recall that’s distinctively
different about each generation when you’re talking? Are there some
differences you notice in the stories that you tell and Matt tells and your
daughter tells?

Bullock

Well, yes. Of course, there’s a difference in the parties. The parties are
different, especially with Matthew—the hazing. Of course, when we
went to school, hazing—they did anything they wanted to in those
fraternities and everything. They were always pulling stuff. He can’t do
anything. That’s one thing. He was telling me what all they cannot do
anymore. I said, “Well, I guess so. Can you make a pledge shine your
shoes?” “No, we can’t do that.” I thought, “Well, that’s kind of
harmless.” (Laughter)

Gill

It is different, isn’t it?

Bullock

I noticed that, and there are more rules. Of course, there is a lot of
difference with their cell phones and their X-Boxes. All that technical
stuff is a lot different. They have a lot more help in studying with their
PCs, where we all trekked off to the library. When I finally decided it
was time for me to study, I went to the library and just sat there and
looked up stuff. Now, they’re just computers. Everything is just right
now! (Laughs)

Gill

Back to Matthew, let me ask you. Matthew is the fifth generation. Does
he already know the pressure is on him for the sixth generation?
(Laughs)

Bullock

He knows, he knows. He’s a good guy.

Gill

Is he having a good experience at Oklahoma State, as far as you know?

Bullock

Oh, yes he loves it. He joined Sigma Chi. He’s real active. He’s been an
officer, he’s been in the Varsity Review, and he’s been in all this stuff,
and he studies all the time. He recently got another scholarship. There
was a guy, a Sigma Chi, that was in a bad accident ten or twelve years
ago, so his brothers get up this scholarship, several of them, and they
award it during Parents’ Day. I think April, Mother’s/ Parents’ Day, I
went up to the Sigma Chi house and they had all these functions. They
said, “We are going to present this scholarship.” I said, “Okay.” So, they
come out and talk. “And this year’s recipient is Matthew Horning.” I
went, (claps) “Yay!” (Laughter) It was about six or seven hundred
bucks. So, he’s doing really well there.

16

Gill

Speaking of Jamie, I’m going to skip a generation here. Was she ready
to come to OSU when it was time to come? Had you rocked her enough
and whispered in her ear enough?

Bullock

Yes, she was ready to go. She was going to be a doctor for a while. After
one year she decided, just maybe, she would be an engineer instead.
(Laughs) I guess it was going to take too long. She’s a chemical
engineer. Jim Horning is a chemical engineer.

Gill

They met at OSU?

Bullock

Yes, they met in class.

Gill

A lot of good things happen at OSU, don’t they?

Bullock

Yes, she just loved it. She was a Kappa Kappa Gamma, and she loved
that. She had a great time. She would come over to Mom’s house and
wash all her clothes, and sit there with Mom and Dad. They’d talk to
her. She’d come over and see them a lot. Also, my second child,
Melissa, both her and her husband went to Oklahoma State, too.

Gill

Let me ask you, has it changed a lot since you were on campus? A lot of
new buildings?

Bullock

Oh, yes!

Gill

Are you proud of how the university has developed?

Bullock

Oh, just huge! Of course, the T. Boone Pickens Stadium, oh boy! I have
even gone through a tour of that stadium. That’s impressive. Of course,
the Architecture Building is beautiful. I toured that with Matthew.

Gill

The only problem is that everything is tore up all the time, isn’t it?
(Laughs)

Bullock

I know, it’s already torn up. I went to that Classroom Building. That
Business Building wasn’t Spears, was it?

Gill

The Business Building wasn’t there until the sixties, I think.

Bullock

Well, when I went, there was a business…

Gill

Morrill Hall?

Bullock

I guess, because Jamie…

Gill

Most of the business classes used to be over in Morrill Hall, I think.

Bullock

It was right where it was when I went, still there.

Gill

Yes, still there.

Bullock

Of course, I’ve been in the Seretean Center. We went to some plays that
the kids put on. We belong to Emeriti, and we go to those things on
Monday night. They’d have a nice dinner, listen to a lot of nice speakers.
I met several people there. They asked us to take over bridge. We play a
lot of bridge. We’re big time bridge players. We might do that. So, we’re
just enjoying Oklahoma State. Of course, in the summer it gets a little
dull because no one is here. (Laughs)

Gill

They’re back.

Bullock

They’re back.

Gill

Anything that we haven’t covered that you think about over your
generation, the five generations? Any comments you want to make, or
something you want to bring up?

Bullock

I’m sure I will think of something once I leave. (Laughter) You always
think, “Oh, I should’ve said that.” With the kids, the kids had such a
[great experience]. Interviewing those kids will be such a delight.

Gill

My final question is this. OSU has changed a lot physically.

Bullock

Oh, yes.

Gill

What has stayed the same? What are the principles and values about
Oklahoma State University that you’ve always appreciated that you
think have continued through these five generations?

Bullock

I’ve gotten to know [former OSU President James] Halligan. Of course,
we’re big conservatives. So, we see Halligans everywhere. I like them,
and they kept the values. They’ve done real well. I really like them.
They are very active in everything. I like [President] Burns Hargis. I
think he is trying to keep the same values and standards. Of course, I
was very good friends with John Bryant. He was in the architecture
department. He retired and has passed away, but he had a lot of integrity.
He was a dean for a while in architecture. The kids change, the
technology changes, but there are certain standards for every year and
every generation. I think that integrity [has remained].

Gill

When you talk to other people about OSU, certain things come up, like

18

that people cared about you, the friendliness, the environment, the
beauty of the campus, and some of these things sort of continue. The
land-grant tradition about teaching, research, and extension. So, I just
wonder if any of those things sort of resonated with you?
Bullock

Yes, I think I get that feeling when I’m up around, like in the Alumni
Building. I even met Travis Ford once.

Gill

Travis Ford?

Bullock

Travis Ford, the basketball coach. I met him. When he talks to you and
he shakes your hand, you feel like this guy really cared. Of course, he
cared about the basketball team, but I really liked him. Now I see Mike
Gundy in church all the time with his little three kids. (Laughs) But I
don’t know. I just think there are some really good folks there, and
they’re still there. I meet them, and I’ve met a lot that have retired
because that’s how I am now, and you meet them in various places.
They have the same philosophy that the people when I went to school
had, the professors, when they were professors, but they’ve retired. I
knew then the physical, and there is certainly a lot of that, and the way
you study, and all this extra stuff you’ve got to do things, to teach, that
caring and that integrity that’s still there. I see it all the time.

Gill

I appreciate it. Thank you.

Bullock

You’re welcome.
