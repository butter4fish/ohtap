About Priscilla Decker…
Priscilla Decker grew up in southern Oklahoma with parents who both worked in education.
She attended Ardmore High School where she took a journalism class with a teacher who
suggested she try Oklahoma State University for her college career. She enrolled at OSU,
majoring in journalism and working on the Daily O’Collegian where she eventually became
editor. At OSU, she lived in Willard Hall and had the same roommate for all four years.
Decker enjoyed activities on or close to campus such as dances, movies, and football games,
and she tried pizza for the first time when Hideaway opened.
She began dating her husband-to-be (who she had met several years earlier), and since he
was already in graduate school when they began dating, he was on his way to Purdue for his
PhD. After she finished her undergraduate degree, the two married, and she joined him in
Indiana where she worked as writer and editor for several of the school’s publications. In
1965 the couple moved to Weatherford, and Southwestern Oklahoma State University
invited her to teach journalism and to be the yearbook and newspaper sponsor. She did that
for a year, and then decided to focus on building her family and earning a master’s degree in
English education. After earning the degree and her teaching certificate, she taught English
at Clinton Public Schools for six years, and then became the public information officer in
the superintendent’s office. Over time, she took on more and more responsibilities within
that office, and stayed there for fifteen years until she retired.
In 2011, Decker came back to OSU to celebrate her fiftieth class reunion.

Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Juliana Nykolaiszyn

Stillwater, Oklahoma
Nykolaiszyn

My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University
Library. Today is Friday, October 28, 2011, and I’m at the Edmon Low
Library here in Stillwater, Oklahoma, interviewing Priscilla Decker.
Priscilla is back on campus today for her fiftieth class reunion. Thank
you for joining us.

Decker

You’re welcome.

Nykolaiszyn

Let’s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Could you tell us
where you grew up and give us a little background into your early life?

Decker

I grew up all over southern Oklahoma. My parents were teachers, and
they went from small community to small community in southern
Oklahoma teaching, and my father was often superintendent of the
school. I ended up, all told, attending like a dozen different schools as I
was growing up, so I never had a hometown as most people do. When I
was a junior, my parents were teaching at a small school near Ardmore.
They were always conscious that we should be in a school where we had
opportunities that many of the small schools didn’t have, so they made
arrangements for me to have a room in a woman’s house that they knew
in Ardmore near the school. I went my junior and senior year to
Ardmore High School and graduated from Ardmore, so that was my
graduation school. Actually, about the middle of that year, they bought a
house in Ardmore, so we did actually have a house there for the rest of
the time I was in school.
At Ardmore High School my senior year I took a journalism class, and I
really enjoyed it. When I came to OSU—and I probably would have
gone to Southeastern State College which was at Durant, which is where
my mother and father had gone to school. My two older sisters had gone

4

to East Central in Ada. This journalism teacher had been here at OSU,
and she was always urging that I should consider OSU. That was, I
think, why I decided to come here, really. I had enjoyed that journalism
class.
I started out as an elementary education major since I was from a family
of teachers, that’s what everybody did, but I enrolled in a journalism
class first semester. The class had a lab. There was a lecture in one of the
old Quonset huts, which are long gone, but there was a lab to this
journalism class. That was that you spent some time one day a week at
The O’Collegian. It may have only been an hour that we were required
to do. I don’t remember now, but I got very enamored with The O’Colly
atmosphere and the people there. I continued with my elementary
education major but taking journalism classes until the middle of my
sophomore year and I changed to journalism major with an English
minor. That was how I got into the experience at OSU that probably had
the most influence on my life and on my enjoyment of being here was
working at The O’Colly.
Nykolaiszyn

What was it about The O’Colly?

Decker

Well, I took up the invitation that was on the flyer that I got about the
reunion of the ’61 class this year to send in something about how my
story started or something like that. I don’t remember the title, now. I
just wrote two paragraphs. I mentioned that as a lab in this journalism
class, I had to be at The O’Colly for a certain amount of time once a
week, I think it was. It was the sound of the linotype operator or the
linotype machine over in the corner. It was the smell of the ink down in
the print shop. I was fascinated to watch the linotype machine work, the
linotype operators, the people that were on the staff, but I suppose the
main thing was I liked knowing everything that was going on on
campus, sometimes before anybody else. (Laughs) I think it was
something about being in on what was happening that I enjoyed. I liked
that.

Nykolaiszyn

Do you remember your first story?

Decker

Oh, it’s on one of the sheets here. I kept a scrapbook, so it has clippings.
I was just thumbing through. The cover of this scrapbook has
disintegrated, but the pages are here. On one of them, I have noted that it
was the first story and my first byline. At some point, probably the
beginning of my sophomore year, I think, at that time The O’Collegian
was, and it said so on the mast, the official publication of Oklahoma
State University. We were considered a real official arm of the college.
There was a Board of Education that oversaw us, and we had an advisor.
He was an advisor for both the Redskin and The O’Colly. They were

5

both put out in an old two-story building. (Laughs) It probably was
condemned. It had been built in 1904. It was very creaky and had
wooden stairs. The O’Colly was upstairs, and the Redskin was done
downstairs. The print shop was in the back for The O’Colly. I think it
was just being a part of that. There was sometimes an excitement about
it, to be in on what was going on.
Back to my first story, the note I had on that clipping was that it was the
first story and the first byline and on the front page. We were set up like
a regular newspaper was run at that time, which is what would be
assignments for staff members. We covered those. We were required to
either go to the meeting we were covering or go do an interview if we
were covering a department. We had different assignments.
The first one I was given when I was on the staff—and this is before I
was paid. These were paid positions if you got to a certain point, but if
you were just a reporter, you weren’t paid. Mine was to cover the
International Relations Council. There may not be such a thing now.
That was my assignment, and they met once a week on Wednesday
evening. This was a story covering whoever the speaker was. They had
really kind of important people talking about international problems.
There are several clippings where once a week I covered the
International Relations Council, and I usually got a byline. So that was
my first byline and first story, was covering the International Relations
Council. Then I became the first paid position I had, which I think paid
twenty dollars a month. I was glad to have it.
Nykolaiszyn

That’s a lot of money back then. (Laughter)

Decker

It was very helpful at that time. I was the society editor. We had a
society section. It wasn’t a whole page because we would get a makeup
of each page and, of course, the ad counselors got it first. Their job, first,
was to sell the ads, and they would fill in all the ads. Then the pages
would come upstairs to the newsroom, and we would then have
whatever space to fill up that was left. It was always all of the front page
and parts of the other pages. There was usually one page that was for the
society news.

Nykolaiszyn

Like dances or…

Decker

Oh, yes, there was particularly a column about who was going steady
and who was dropped…

Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Decker

…and who was engaged. You identified them by their sorority or

6

fraternity affiliation or if they were independent by usually their
residence hall. That was called the Social Whirl. People would have to
come up, and there was a basket, and you would drop in this little bit of
information, (Laughs) and also about various meetings or, yes, dances or
things like that that were going on. Usually wasn’t too much room, but
the Social Whirl was in every time. You know, of course, what it was to
be dropped?
Nykolaiszyn

I’m taking it that you were no longer together.

Decker

No, no, no.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay. (Laughter) I was thinking, like, “Dropped? Man!”

Decker

This was on the other side. This would be where you were wearing the
drop of whoever. This was kind of a precursor to being engaged.

Nykolaiszyn

Oh, okay. Like getting pinned.

Decker

Yes.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay. I was thinking something totally worse!

Decker

(Laughs) In the jewelry store in the Student Union you could get little
drops that would be your sorority or fraternity affiliation. Again, those of
us who didn’t belong to a sorority or fraternity, there was one that said
GDI, and that was for the independents.

Nykolaiszyn

What did that stand for?

Decker

God Damn Independent. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

Oh!

Decker

Sorry, but that’s what it stood for!

Nykolaiszyn

That’s great! That’s wonderful. (Laughter)

Decker

I never wore one of those, you understand, but there were people who
did. You could get around specifying that in the Social Whirl, which you
wouldn’t want to do by just giving their residence hall. If it was a
sorority or fraternity, you mentioned those. Some of them did wear that
kind of drop…

Nykolaiszyn

Interesting.

7

Decker

…and were proud of it! (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

I can tell from that time that there was definite lines in the sand drawn.

Decker

Right. Yes. You know, I think a lot of that probably is passé anymore,
which is probably a good thing.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, did you yearn for another assignment, or were you fine with…

Decker

No, because I knew that it was a matter of working your way up. I was
still sent out on other things, but that was my regular job. These were
treated like jobs on a newspaper. The advisor, who was Elmer Woodson,
would be like the publisher of the paper if you were working for a real
newspaper. He served that purpose. We didn’t come to work until early
afternoon. Everybody who was actually on staff, at least the paid staff,
had to take one night a week when we were night editor to get it ready to
be printed, which was late at night. The next morning, Mr. Woodson
would tack The O’Colly up on the bulletin board in the newsroom, and it
would be marked with red for any mistakes we had of all kinds, any
grammar, punctuation, spelling, even comments about how the writing
was done. He didn’t give compliments much. He was kind of a droll
man, but he took his job very seriously, and we learned from him.
I remember the first time I got a red “Good” written across something, a
feature story I’d done. He wrote “Good” across it, and that was probably
the only time I got that kind of compliment on something I had done
from him. I thought he was a tough taskmaster, but my advisor told me
one time when I was kind of complaining how hard it was to work for
him—it was like working for a boss, and that was his job. He said,
“When you graduate from here, you will have all kinds of different jobs,
but no matter what you’re doing, you will have a boss. You will have
someone in that position.” And he said, “What you need to learn now is
how to deal with that and how to make the adjustment of how to work
with somebody who is over you in authority and over what you’re doing
and trying to give you advice.” That was a good piece of advice. I
thanked him many times. I went back and sucked it up.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you advance up the ladder?

Decker

Yes. I was eventually the editor my last semester, so I did move up.

Nykolaiszyn

Take me through a typical day as an editor.

Decker

Well, none of them were typical. (Laughs) That’s why it was fun. If
there was not a whole lot going on, all I had to make sure was that
people were doing their assignments and were on the job. There was a

8

sports editor who was covering the sports, and then as I said, at the time,
there was a society editor. I think there was someone who even did the
religious news that was in the Saturday paper. I don’t know how The
O’Colly is done now, but we put out an O’Colly, it came out every
morning, Tuesday through Saturday except in the summer. The summer
term, it was twice a week. I did work on it two summers, I guess. The
main thing that the editor had to do was write a column, not every day,
but you were supposed to be knowledgeable enough to make some
interesting comments about what was going on at some point or another,
particularly if there was a controversy, and to cover the student senate.
That was the editor’s assignment.
Other than that, the nitty-gritty of the daily work was done by, there was
an associate editor and an assistant editor. There were two desks right
inside the front door. They were the ones who really got the paper put
together because the reporters would go out and turn in whatever they
had. The sports editor would make up their own page, but the two
editors (sometimes there might only be one there) they would make up
the front page, dummy it in, and assign the stories.
We had an AP wire, so we often had national news. That was another
thing. You could stay on top of what was happening nationally because
that teletype was going all the time. I think I may have called it a
linotype a while ago. I meant teletype. The teletype was always going. If
there was some big news the bell would ring, and we’d all go over and
see what it was because often it was something that affected Oklahoma
State in one way or the other. Sometimes it was just some big national
happening. We would tear off the wire, the editors would, the associate
or assistant editor, whoever is on the desk, and decide what to do with
the wire stories. Often one of them was on the front page but not always.
They would mark up the page where these stories were going. Then they
would put on what size headline needed to go on it, depending on where
they put it on the page. That would go over to the other person, and they
would write the headlines.
Once it was ready, that’d be trotted down the stairs and back to the
pressroom. The linotype operators came on about, seems like maybe
three o’clock. I don’t know. There was an older fellow who was the
main linotype operator, and I loved to watch him do that. It was hot type,
and you would see these little letters that would come down the chute
and make a line, and then they’d make another line. I don’t know. It was
just fascinating to watch. He was very good, and he was a lovely man.
Sometimes if it was late and you wanted to get something in that night, I
would watch him do it. I’d take it down there, and I’d just stand there
and watch him type it all in.

9

Well, back to what the editor did. They did cover the student senate
meetings. They wrote columns. They handled letters to the editor that
came in. They did not accept a letter unless it was signed and the person
identified, but you could have the name withheld on request. Sometimes
there were crisis situations. I remember, I was not the editor at the time
when there was kind of a problem with the choral festival that was held
here. I don’t know whether that was like in February or some time. High
school choirs would come, and there would be a massed choir with a
director who was a guest director that would come and take them
through their paces and so on.
Anyway, one time for the choral festival, it seems like it was right before
Thanksgiving. It was that time of year. I can’t remember for sure.
Anyway, a bunch of these high school students just started fainting, and
there was this mass confusion of students keeling over. They took some
of them to the armory, and I don’t know where else, but I remember that
Mr. Woodson and I went to the armory to try to get the news. Other
members of the staff were sent out to other places, maybe some to
Gallagher Arena. It was held in Gallagher Arena. We were very late
because all of us then had to come back and put our stories together and
make some sense out of all of this. It was very late getting done, but Mr.
Woodson did not think we did a good job of combining all our different
—I remember the next day, he had some advice about how we could
have coordinated all of these stories together a little better.
They thought (at the time, it was cold weather) that the buses the
students had come in, the drivers had gone out and turned them on to
heat up, and that the air intake had pulled in the exhaust. They thought
that’s what the problem was. There weren’t any serious illnesses. I don’t
think anybody was hospitalized. It was probably partly a mass response.
When some of them started fainting, others went down. That was a big
deal. That was something we went out and tried to have pretty thorough
coverage. I think that was the one that the papers like the Tulsa World
and the Oklahoman picked up our story on it.
Nykolaiszyn

What were some of the other big issues of the day going on when you
were in school?

Decker

Well, just looking back over the clippings, I saw two or three things.
One was I found a clipping that I had kind of forgotten about. There was
a controversy about a young man who was African American. I don’t
remember the organization now. It was maybe a business kind of club or
something. Anyway, they were having a convention, state convention, in
Tulsa. The headquarters for the convention was some hotel in Tulsa,
some big hotel. He had been given a room at the YMCA. He was
running for an office in the state organization, and it was someone who

10

was well-known on campus. The name was well-known, familiar to me
anyway. He left the convention and had lodged a protest because they
had set up his campaign booth in the lobby of the hotel. He said the
other people who were running for office had suites in the hotel because
they were staying there. Since he wasn’t staying there, they had set his
campaign headquarters up in the lobby. He felt that that was unfair, and
so he had resigned and come back, and he was protesting that. That was
on the front page of The O’Colly. That story was on the front page. I
think students today would be surprised to know that that was an issue.
Whoever was president of the group said they felt like they had treated
him equally to other people, and he felt like he wasn’t. I think that would
be something that students today wouldn’t understand.
Nykolaiszyn

Sure.

Decker

That’s why that was a controversy at the time. I noticed as I walked in
and saw the Edmon Low name—I actually interviewed him. I came here
to the library and interviewed him in his office about students putting
soap in the fountain. That may not sound like a big problem, but it was
because he said it clogged up the filter. They would just pour, like, a
whole box of some kind of detergent in it, (Laughs) and it clogged up
the filter. Actually, it would flood the basement, and they would have to
go in and completely take all the mechanism apart and clean it and put it
back together. It cost money, and the fountain would be down for two or
three days while they were working on it. I guess he had called and
wanted to talk to somebody about it. I was sent over here, and I
interviewed him and wrote the story about that. I noticed in the clippings
it wasn’t but a few days later that it happened again, so I had written
another one about it. He said, “We don’t know that it’s the students that
are doing this, but whoever is doing it, they don’t understand what a
problem it is and how expensive it is.” He said, “If it doesn’t stop, we’ll
just have to shut the fountain down.”

Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Decker

So that was a big deal... (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

Sure.

Decker

…at the time. Apparently it’s not a problem now.

Nykolaiszyn

Apparently not because it still happens occasionally.

Decker

Does it?

Nykolaiszyn

Oh, yes.

11

Decker

Really? So that didn’t have much effect.

Nykolaiszyn

No, we still get suds in the fountain, but not so much of the…

Decker

Does it shut it down?

Nykolaiszyn

No.

Decker

They’ve probably upgraded the equipment. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

Oh, yes, I think so.

Decker

By now, it’s computerized or something.

Nykolaiszyn

Students will be students.

Decker

Of course, even then, the engineers put green in it, dyed it green during
engineering week. It was green. I noticed today it’s orange.

Nykolaiszyn

Every Homecoming.

Decker

I don’t think at Homecoming, then, it was orange, but it was green for
engineering week.

Nykolaiszyn

That’s interesting.

Decker

I was visiting with someone about the class fifty years ago being here,
graduated fifty years ago. I think things that I found in my box of
memorabilia, students don’t know anything about now. We had, for
instance, the Mortar Board calendars. I’m sure you paid something for
them, but it wasn’t much. That’s how Mortar Board, I think, made
money. I don’t know. Is there still a Mortar Board organization?

Nykolaiszyn

I think there still is.

Decker

Okay. That was outstanding women on campus. I couldn’t have lived
without my Mortar Board calendar. I don’t know what we paid for it. I
guess it wasn’t very much or I couldn’t have afforded it. I found the ones
from ’59 and ’60. It’s like having a diary because I noted things in there
like when I had dates, what we did and where we went. I’m glad I have
those. I don’t know where the other two are, but I did find those two.
Also in those days when I started here, we enrolled by hand with an
envelope. Actually, that was about, I don’t know, four-by-five. Maybe it
was bigger than that. It might have been like five-by-six. We had

12

columns where we put the room number and the—what am I trying to
say? I can’t remember now. (Laughs) I’m sure you don’t even use that.
Sections. There were sections. You put the room number, the section
number, the name, the instructor, and what room it met in. I have those
for all the semesters I was here. I’m glad, because then I would know
who the instructor was. I have noted even who my instructors were.
Nykolaiszyn

Would you have to turn that in or stand in a line, or…

Decker

Yes, you did. You filled that out and usually with your academic advisor
because there was a place for them to sign down here. Yes, you would
stand in line and get cards for each one of those, which we’d put in the
envelope. I think when you went to the class, you gave the instructor the
card. That’s kind of my remembrance of that. I know there were
envelopes, and I have the envelopes. I think that you had to stand in line
for each one of those and get a card. If you got up to the head of the line
and there were no more cards, you had to redo the enrollment packet.
You’d have to change. I didn’t enroll early. I just enrolled when I got
here that freshman year. My freshman English class was a five-hour
class. Since I was among the last to enroll, it was at four o’clock in the
afternoon (Laughs) because nobody wanted an English class five days a
week at four o’clock in the afternoon.

Nykolaiszyn

Tell me where you lived on campus.

Decker

Willard Hall.

Nykolaiszyn

The whole time?

Decker

Yes.

Nykolaiszyn

What was it like living in Willard?

Decker

Room 207 on the second floor. I had the same roommate for three and a
half years. I graduated in January and got married and went with my
husband where he was in graduate school at Purdue. She and I also lived
together in the summer before our senior year over at (where were we?)
North Murray, I think, which was just across the street. We were in
room 207 of Willard. I liked living in the dorm. I was fine. It was great
having the same roommate the whole time. That was good. In fact, she’s
here today. She and her husband are here. We’ve maintained contact all
these years. It’s been a long-term friendship. We happened to be next
door to the floor monitor. You’ve heard about those?

Nykolaiszyn

Sure, yes. That couldn’t have been good.

13

Decker

(Laughs) It didn’t bother us. We were on our best behavior, and we were
okay. We weren’t wild and crazy. Your freshman year, you had to check
out to go to the library. She had kind of a stenographer’s notebook hung
on her door, and you just had to put your name in and when you checked
out. She did do a hall check at ten o’clock to make sure everybody was
in.

Nykolaiszyn

So what happens when you’re late?

Decker

Well, you were seen by the housemother, I think. I don’t know that that
ever happened to me. I wrote in my little thing about my story (“where
my story began,” I think that was it) that another advantage to working
at The O’Colly was that, as I said before, I had to be night editor, once I
was really on the staff, one night a week. Sometimes I would fill in for
somebody who was ill, or I would trade off with somebody, so
sometimes it was twice a week.
By then, my fiancé and I probably took advantage of that. I had
established a reputation in Willard that I went by the rules and I hadn’t
caused any problems. They locked the back door at ten o’clock. When I
was working late and if I was putting the paper to bed, it would often be
eleven, maybe midnight if there was some big story coming in late or if I
had covered the senate and had to write the story and do all that, so my
fiancé at the time would come often and walk me back to Willard.
Sometimes we would take advantage of the fact that all I had to do was
buzz the doorbell and the gal from the desk would come and let me in,
and never any questions asked because they knew I was working at The
O’Colly.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, there you go. Benefits of the job.

Decker

Yes. We didn’t do that all the time, but that was one of the perks for
working at The O’Colly.

Nykolaiszyn

Did Willard have any traditions that you can recall?

Decker

Oh, I’m trying to think if we even did a house decoration for
Homecoming, and I guess we did, but since I was working at The
O’Colly and was often working late, I didn’t get in on that sort of thing. I
don’t know about that. Our cafeteria was a public cafeteria, which was
different from Murray and Stout, the other women’s dorms. I liked that
because we had people, particularly from Whitehurst, that would come
over and eat there. That was just across the parking lot.
At the time, I guess, I don’t know whether that was the case all the time
I was in Willard or not, but I know about the first two years, North

14

Murray was for graduate men. Most of them were foreign students. They
came and ate in Willard. My roommate and I made some good
friendships just visiting with them and doing things with them.
When we passed the sign for Lake Carl Blackwell, I mentioned to Joy, I
said, “It says, ‘Fee required.’” We didn’t have to pay a fee when we
went to Lake Carl Blackwell.” She said, “No, we didn’t.” She said, “I
have a picture that somebody took of me out there.” I said, “I don’t have
that picture. I have a picture of when some of us went out there for a
picnic all day with these guys from North Murray, and we had a good
day at Lake Carl Blackwell, just hanging out.”
Nykolaiszyn

What countries were they from?

Decker

One of them was from Iran. This was the time of the Shah over there.
One of them was Czechoslovakian, but he had lived in Portugal. He
spoke whatever they speak in Portugal. (Laughs) He spoke Por—

Nykolaiszyn

Portuguese?

Decker

Portuguese. He spoke Portuguese because his family had fled
Czechoslovakia at the time of the takeover there, the Soviet takeover. He
had lived in Portugal, so he spoke that language. Then they had
immigrated to, seems like maybe, Brazil or one of the South American
countries, I think. He was actually here having come through that route.
These were graduate students, mostly in engineering. Through them, we
met probably—those were the two I remember most. There were others,
but they ate in Willard regularly, and we’d visit with them.
There was a professor here who was Dr. Petrzelka who was
Czechoslovakian, and if we went to some event, he would be there.
Sometimes we’d just meet in the Union or something. He was such a
sweet man, learned and very friendly and kind. I noticed in the pictures,
there’s one of them with him, and I just remembered. Somebody had
written an article in The O’Colly about him with a picture. I look at those
now, and I wonder what happened to those people and where they ended
up. I don’t know. I liked that about the Willard cafeteria because there
were other people there and we did meet people that we probably
wouldn’t have otherwise that we were friends with, so that was good.

Nykolaiszyn

How was the food?

Decker

You know, I didn’t complain about dorm food. I know that’s heretical,
but I thought the food was good. (Laughs) I did. I thought Willard had
good food. That was probably partly because it was a public cafeteria
and they fed people from all over the campus, especially from

15

Whitehurst, who came over there for lunch. That probably had
something to do with it.
Nykolaiszyn

You mentioned Lake Carl Blackwell. Did you go any other places for
fun?

Decker

I didn’t have a car, and most of the people I knew didn’t have a car.
Nobody had a car in those days on campus, so you’re pretty much stuck
on campus to do what was going on here. We went to dances. I have
pictures. There was a Howdy Dance. There was a Sadie Hawkins Dance.
There was a Junior-Senior Prom Dance. I do have pictures of dances,
one or two. The Howdy Dance was held on what was then kind of a
patio on the east side of the Student Union, long gone with the addition,
I’m sure. That was right at the beginning of school. We went to football
games. My roommate played in the band, and I enjoyed watching the
band.
Actually, my husband played in the band, but I wasn’t dating him until
he was a graduate student. He wasn’t in the band, I think, after he was a
graduate student. One of our sons came here to OSU and graduated in
December of ’89. He played in the band, so we would come up and
watch football games. That was when Barry Sanders was playing, and I
was telling my roommate coming in that our youngest son would come
with us, then. He was younger than Joel by about seven years. He has
been a dedicated fan of Barry Sanders ever since.
Anyway, back to activities we did when I was here. I don’t know. I just
remember the dances. There was a movie house on the corner. Hideaway
has now taken over that corner, Campus Corner. It showed sort of older
movies, and you could go real cheap. I think it was like a dollar or
something. (Laughs) We went to movies there quite a bit. Although, I
did have dates at the movie downtown. I can’t remember the name of it
now, but there was a movie downtown.

Nykolaiszyn

The Leachman?

Decker

Yes. Yes, that’s it. One of the interesting things for my husband and me
was that we had—I don’t know if it was our first date or not. I wouldn’t
say that for sure. I had never had pizza before, and the Hideaway opened
in 1957, which was the year I came. I think I had probably gone there
with other friends, but I remember that’s where he and I would go for
dates.

Nykolaiszyn

What did you think about pizza?

Decker

Oh, I thought it was good. To this day, my husband and I thought the

16

Hideaway pizza was the best and there was nothing better than
Hideaway pizza. If it’s your first, you always think that’s the pinnacle.
When we came back for his class’ fiftieth reunion in 2008, we had lunch
at the Hideaway. We always thought it was the best. You know, there
are Hideaways now in Oklahoma City, and it’s good. We would analyze
why it was better than anybody else. Well, we thought the crust, and
then the sauce. (Laughs) In fact, Richard Dermer [Hideaway owner] was
in my freshman English class.
Nykolaiszyn

He was an English major.

Decker

Yes. At the time, I recall, he sat on the back row and some days, he was
very drowsy. I read later or looked at his interview on the site (I think
that’s where I saw where he was telling about, or I’ve read it
somewhere) that he was working some other job, and then he and a
partner started the Hideaway. He was working all the time. No wonder
he was kind of barely there in that freshman English class.

Nykolaiszyn

Falling asleep.

Decker

But you can understand.

Nykolaiszyn

You mentioned your husband. Where did you meet your husband?

Decker

I had known of him when I was in the eighth grade. Actually, my two
sisters knew him before I did. He grew up in Ada, Oklahoma, because
his dad was head of the Chemistry Department at East Central at Ada.
Rolan attended Horace Mann School, which was the teacher training
school. At that time, there was six sister state colleges. They had their
own teacher training schools, at least East Central did, and I think
several of the others did, too, on the campus. That was where the
education majors would do their practice teaching. That’s what Horace
Mann was, so he went to school and graduated from Horace Mann.
When I was in the eighth grade, I lived most of that year with my oldest
sister who was a senior that year at East Central. She was a double music
major. She was in the orchestra, and my future husband, who was still in
high school at the time, played cello in that orchestra, so she knew him
then.
I can remember hearing her and her friends who were other orchestra
members talk about this upstart kid who was still in high school playing
in the orchestra. It was because the orchestra director needed a cello, and
he knew Rolan had musical ability, so he asked him. He’d give him
lessons if he’d play the cello in the orchestra, so that’s how he got
started. She knew him, and then Rolan also played clarinet in the band.
My middle sister, who went to East Central for two years, was a twirler

17

in the East Central band, so she knew him in the band. Again, he was in
high school at the time. Horace Mann wasn’t big enough to have its
own. That was an advantage he thought he had going to Horace Mann is
that he’d had college instructors for some of his classes and he could
play in the band and orchestra even though he was still in high school.
So they knew him, and I went to Horace Mann during my eighth grade
year because I lived with my oldest sister that year. He was three years
older, so I just knew who he was by name. I didn’t really know him.
Then we reconnected here, actually, through the student religious
organizations which are probably not on campus anymore, either. At the
time, each religious denomination had a student organization that was
functioning in it. I was Presbyterian, and he was Disciples.
During the time that we were in college, those two student organizations
merged, and we came together through that. As I said, by the time we
were actually dating, he was doing graduate work here. Then he got
accepted to Purdue to go straight to the PhD in chemistry there. He was
up there one semester, and then I finished in January. Got married and
went to Purdue. I was editor of The O’Colly that fall semester. That was
during the time when the semester ended in January. You had, oh,
probably two weeks after you came back to school and then take finals.
We were married right after I finished the semester in January of 1961.
Nykolaiszyn

As you’re going through school, do you have any ideas of what you
want to be when you get older?

Decker

Well, I think some people know exactly. I told my kids, and I used to tell
students when I was teaching, college is when you can figure that out.
Don’t think that you have to go to college knowing exactly where that’s
going to lead because college is a good time to try different avenues if
you’re not sure. I think that’s what I did. I started out in elementary
education and veered off into journalism and English.
Our son who came here knew when he was in the eighth grade he
wanted to do something with computers. That’s when computers were
new, really. He knew from the time he was in the eighth grade that he
wanted to do something with computers, so he came to OSU, but it took
him three majors to get the right track for what he really wanted to do
with computers. He started out in computer engineering and saw that
wasn’t quite right, and I think he was a semester in computer
engineering technology, but that wasn’t it either. He didn’t want to build
them. Then I think he made maybe one other shift, but he ended up
finally in the School of Arts and Sciences with a computer major and a
business minor, and then he was right on track for what he wanted to do.
I think college is the time to figure that out. I think a lot of students

18

come thinking they’re aiming for something and then find other avenues.
Then there was my husband who came and knew he was going to major
in chemistry. He ended up teaching, which is what he thought he wasn’t
going to do. He was pretty clear he wasn’t going to teach, and while he
was in graduate school, he discovered that that’s what he really liked to
do. He spent his career teaching chemistry at Southwestern [Oklahoma
State University], and he loved it. It was his calling. I think you have to
be open to what’s—he often said that he could have majored in music or
chemistry. He decided that music could be an avocation better than
chemistry could. That’s really what he did, then. His music was his
avocation. He retired sooner than a lot of people do, even though he had
thirty-one years. He said, “I don’t want to get to the point that I can’t do
anything else because there are other things I want to do.” So he did. He
retired, and he did music and drama and things he enjoyed.
I think college is when you can try different avenues and see where
you’re really happy. I didn’t end up doing journalism, per se, but I’ve
often said that I really learned in the practice of working for The
O’Colly. In that work, I really learned what stood me in good stead in all
of my English because I later did some graduate work in English and got
a master’s in English education. I had to write a paper, you know, in
every class. I think that I learned a lot from working at The O’Colly that
helped me in my English classes.
I’ve also often said that my freshman English teacher taught me the most
of what was useful when I was writing for The O’Colly. She was a real
stickler about misspelled words, about not being redundant, about using
different words so you didn’t repeat a word more than once, choosing
words, having a good vocabulary, being concise, being organized. I
learned from her the things that really helped me probably the most in
the writing, the journalism writing, more than journalism classes, really.
I used that, too, all the way through when I had to do papers in English.
While I didn’t really end up as a journalist, per se, I did for a while work
at a radio station which was a new experience. I used my journalism for
that. I covered city council meetings and school board meetings and
reported on elections. I hadn’t ever worked at a radio station, so that was
kind of interesting. I considered myself a journalist, part-time. (Laughs)
Nykolaiszyn

It goes hand in hand. It transfers. Those skills transfer.

Decker

Yes. Yes. I got them here, so I was satisfied with my classes and the
work that I did here.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you ever end up in the classroom teaching, yourself?

19

Decker

I did, finally, at the age of forty. I said, “At the age of forty, I had a
midlife crisis and started teaching school.” (Laughs) When my husband
began teaching at Southwestern in Weatherford—while he was in
graduate school at Purdue, I had worked at the university editor’s office,
which was the office for Purdue that published all their publications,
catalogs. They had a little in-house magazine. I wrote for that and so on
and did a lot of editing of materials and bulletins and publications that
were put out through that office.
When he got the job at Southwestern in 1965, I realized that there wasn’t
going to be much opportunity in western Oklahoma for me. The only
journalism jobs were working for small-town newspapers. The local
newspaper wasn’t interested in hiring me, and frankly I wasn’t too
interested in working for them, anyway, so that’s all right. The college
[hired me] that one year, the first year—they did know I had a
journalism degree. The man they had hired to teach journalism left right
about the time that school was starting. That was during the boom of
Southwestern. They were growing by leaps and bounds. They asked me
to come in on a temporary part-time basis and teach the journalism
classes and sponsor the yearbook and newspaper, so I did that at
Southwestern that one year. In the middle of that year, we adopted our
first child, so we kind of started on our family.
I saw that probably there wasn’t going to be much opportunity for
journalism work out there, so I started taking classes to get a master’s in
English ed, which I did. During that time, I worked. I edited a weekly
advertiser paper for a few months, and then I worked at the radio station
for a time. In getting the master’s, I worked on my teaching certificate. I
didn’t really actually apply until my youngest child started kindergarten.
When he was five, I sent out applications, and I started teaching at
Clinton Public Schools. I only taught freshman English there for six
years, and they opened up the position in the superintendent’s office for
someone to do public information for the schools.

Nykolaiszyn

Right up your alley.

Decker

Yes, that was my perfect job. I did really like that. I did that for fourteen
or fifteen years until I retired. When it started out, that was really what I
was doing. I was doing publicity for them, and I was taking lots of
pictures. They bought a camera. I took pictures, and I wrote stories, and
they were all in the local paper. I already knew the school system, and I
knew the teachers. I would be in all the classrooms, and I knew
programs. It was great fun. I did brochures and everything.
Somewhere along the line, the assistant superintendent needed my help
to do things like grant proposals and so on. He wanted me to help write

20

some of his stuff. I began to help him, and I took on more and more,
assisting him. When he became superintendent, he kind of divided his
job between me and the high school principal. I really became more of
an administrator then, and I took on more administrative work. I did
enjoy doing that.
Nykolaiszyn

Are there any places on campus that are just really special to you when
you think about them?

Decker

Oh, the Student Union. We used to go over to the Student Union for
coffee from The O’Colly. We’d take a break and go over there,
particularly at night if we were working at night. The dance floor up on
the fourth floor, there was a jukebox. It was nearly always going because
somebody was nearly always up there. I’d go up there with somebody,
and we’d dance. Willard, our room at Willard Hall, that was home for
the time I was here. Theta Pond, I always thought that was pretty. It was
a peaceful place to go. Of course, it was near Willard. The Hideaway for
pizza, it was in a little storefront place, very different from where it is
now, very small, really.
And, of course, The O’Colly offices. I saw in that book about the growth
of the campus, something entitled OAMC about the growth of the
facilities or something over the years from the beginning, that that
building was actually torn down just probably a couple years after I
graduated, not long after I graduated. It had been the creamery for the
dairy herd. That’s what it was built for in 1904. (Laughs) It suited The
O’Colly well because there is a picture in this book that I have that
shows the equipment from when it was the creamery, and on the
concrete floor there were these huge various kinds of containers and
machines and whatever. They needed that heavy concrete floor to put
the press on. The press was on the concrete floor at the back of it. It was
an old building. I enjoyed the time I was there.
I was gone one time overnight for something. I think they had a shower
for us after I was engaged, in Ada, and I was gone overnight. When I
came back, there was some kind of a big to-do because there had been
some kind of a panel again, I think, in Tulsa. One of the foreign students
from OSU had said something that somebody inferred, from what he
said, that OSU was not friendly to foreign students. I came back late and
went to work, and I was tired, and here was this parade of people
bringing letters [and complaints] to the editor. Of course, that was the
semester I was editor. That was the most stressful time I can recall. It
was the only time that I went into the bathroom, which was at the back
of that top floor, and cried because I was so frustrated that all this had
broken loose and I wasn’t here. I didn’t really know what was going on,
and all these people were in an uproar over whether OSU was friendly to

21

their foreign students or not. Of course, I had friends who were foreign
students. That was the only time I remember not handling it well.
As I said, I, particularly, didn’t have a car, so I would have to bum rides
home with people. Nobody wanted to stay until I got out of English class
at five o’clock. That was always a problem, (Laughter) so I would either
have to cut class or they’d wait on me.
Nykolaiszyn

What was Homecoming like when you were a student?

Decker

Oh, actually pretty much, I think, like it is here. I do guess that Willard
had some kind of decoration because it was always on that west side of
the building and our room was on the west side on the second floor. I
can kind of recall that our window would be covered up, I think. As I
said, I never got in on that, particularly, because I was working at the
paper. That would be a busy time for us, really. I think the house
decorations were not as over the top, elaborate as they are now. For one
thing, they didn’t have all the mechanical stuff that they do now, all the
extra power and so on, but there were some pretty elaborate things done.
I always went to the parade. Well, I started to say that but, yes, I
probably did go to the parade because I knew people in the band.

Nykolaiszyn

You started in ’57?

Decker

Yes.

Nykolaiszyn

So you were around when Pistol Pete became the official mascot?

Decker

Yes.

Nykolaiszyn

Was that a big deal?

Decker

I don’t recall that, particularly, although I remember we had articles
about the original man that it was based on. I kind of remember. In fact,
now that I kind of think back on it, I think he was the marshal at one of
the parades, probably, while I was here. The carillon was a favorite thing
when I was here. I just now was hearing it. I loved to hear that, and I still
do when I’m here. I love that.

Nykolaiszyn

Would it play anything different?

Decker

Yes, on Sunday afternoons it would play things, I guess hymns. I don’t
remember for sure. It seems like it would play a little while on Sunday
afternoon. I don’t remember other times, although there might have
been, when it played songs. I can’t remember that for sure, but I know
on Sunday afternoons sometimes it would play things. I like the carillon.

22

Nykolaiszyn

I like it during the holidays. It’ll play Christmas music.

Decker

Yes, right. I was trying to think. It seems like maybe special times
sometimes it would play things.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you spend much time in the library studying?

Decker

Yes. Yes, I was in the library. As I said, when we were freshmen, we
could check out to the library, but you had to say that’s where you were
going, and you weren’t supposed to go anywhere else. (Laughs) We
were trustworthy, weren’t we? I do think maybe sometimes we went
over to the Union for coffee.

Nykolaiszyn

Did the library look much different?

Decker

Well, yes. I was telling my roommate after they got here, I said, “You
might want to come over and look at the library.” I said, “For one thing,
there are computers all over the place.” There were stacks. I had a
humanities class, and a lot of the things we had to read were on reserve.
You’d have to go in the reserve stack and find what you wanted. Do they
still have monitors that wander through periodically to see if…

Nykolaiszyn

Not really, not that I know of.

Decker

…you’re doing what you’re supposed to be doing and not bothering
anything?

Nykolaiszyn

No. We have security, but I mean…

Decker

All right, but do they still check your books as you go out?

Nykolaiszyn

We check books at Circulation, and they only check you if you go out
and you make the doors ring.

Decker

Really?

Nykolaiszyn

Yes.

Decker

There was usually a man who was at the desk between the front doors.
Or are there two desks between the front doors?

Nykolaiszyn

There are.

Decker

Seems like maybe there was one at each. They wore suits, and they
must’ve been graduate students, I’m guessing. You had to put all your

23

material up there, and they would thumb through it, books. If you had
things in a bag, you had to empty it. If it was just a book and a notebook,
they would thumb through them.
Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Decker

Then they or someone in their group would periodically kind of wander
through the floors. [My roommate and I] knew these graduate students,
and up on the fifth floor, there were study carrels for graduate students. I
think they were assigned certain ones. We’d go up there with them, and
it was quiet, and there wasn’t much activity. We would use one of the
unused study carrels. One time, one of the monitors said we shouldn’t be
up there, that we weren’t graduate students and we didn’t belong up
there. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

Do you remember if you could wear pants in the library? Women?

Decker

I guess so because I don’t remember that being—I’m sure I must’ve
worn pants some. I don’t remember that being anything. Was that at
some time?

Nykolaiszyn

At some point. At some point you couldn’t wear pants.

Decker

Boy, I don’t remember that being a thing to bother about. I really don’t,
but we did wear skirts a lot more then than they do now. Isn’t that
interesting? I can’t remember that.

Nykolaiszyn

You probably would’ve remembered.

Decker

I think so, but I came from a high school where you couldn’t wear pants
to school. On Fridays at Ardmore High School when I was a senior, you
could wear slacks but not jeans. Couldn’t wear jeans, but you could wear
slacks. I think that was only on Fridays. I think I’m right about that. So
that wouldn’t have been a big deal, I guess, if that was the case.

Nykolaiszyn

Looking back, how did attending Oklahoma State really impact your
life?

Decker

Oh, well, I think my life would have been very, very different if I hadn’t
attended Oklahoma State. You know, we were the first class that
graduated when it was OSU for all four years. My husband had been in
the first class that graduated as OSU. It had been OAMC when he
started. Our class was the one that was OSU for the whole four years.
We all had to adjust at the football games because OAMC doesn’t fit the
wave. I mean OSU. I’m sorry. OSU does not fit this as well as OAMC,
so that was kind of an adjustment for him. I wouldn’t have had the

24

experience of working at The O’Colly, which is my most significant, I
suppose, memory of being here. Really, probably impacted what I did
later a great deal, whatever it was. I did date my husband here. I didn’t
actually meet him here, but we started knowing each other here. That
would probably not have happened if I’d gone somewhere else. So it
was a major impact on my life. I’ve always been proud of it.
Nykolaiszyn

I think Oklahoma State is pretty unique in that students and alumni have
this great loyalty towards campus. What do you think is it about OSU
that sparks this loyalty?

Decker

That’s interesting. I tell you what. I think part of it is, at least at the time
I was here, I don’t know whether most of the students, but my sense in it
is that maybe I could say most of the students came from small towns.
This is my husband’s OSU ring. I don’t recall that he ever wore it very
much, but I found it in some things. I don’t remember. He may have
worn it his last year here or something. Anyway, when I found this, I
recalled—and, of course, about the time I graduated from high school,
that was the thing to do. You wore your boyfriend’s ring around your
neck on a chain. I remember when I came, they had this orientation
session. One of the things they told us was, “Take off your high school
graduation ring and leave it at home because you’re now a part of OSU.
You’re not identified by that anymore.” I thought of that when I saw this
ring.
I think the fact that so many of the students (and I would think maybe
most, at the time I was here) came from small towns. Most of them
didn’t have cars, so you had to become a part of the campus. That meant
that you made friends and you joined organizations and you did things
together. You went to football games and dances, so I think you felt like
you were a part of a certain group that was connected by being at OSU
and from OSU. That would be all I’d guess that it was. I don’t know.
I noticed, for instance, when my husband taught at Southwestern, by the
time all students had cars, a lot of them commuted. If they had cars, they
went home every weekend, and that, I think, makes a difference. When I
was a student here, you were here, and so whoever you came in contact
with was part of whatever you were doing. I don’t know. Maybe that
was it. If that’s still happening and students have cars now, maybe that
doesn’t follow. I don’t know.

Nykolaiszyn

Maybe it’s just something about Oklahoma State.

Decker

I don’t know the answer to that. (Laughter) Maybe it’s because
Stillwater is isolated from a large metropolitan area. I think maybe that’s
part of it.

25

Nykolaiszyn

Could be.

Decker

I don’t know. That’s an interesting question.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, as we wind down today, is there anything you’d like to mention
that I have failed to ask you? Anything you’d like to say?

Decker

I think I’ve covered everything and taken enough of your time.
(Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

Well, welcome back.

Decker

I’m sure when I leave here, I’ll think, “Oh, I wish I had told her…” See,
I was often doing three or four things.

Nykolaiszyn

You were juggling a lot.

Decker

I was, and class work suffered often as a result.

Nykolaiszyn

(Laughter) But that’s okay. It’s college.

Decker

But that’s okay.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, we’re back with Priscilla Decker, and you’re going to tell me a
little bit about Varsity Revue. You were involved with that?

Decker

I remembered, yes, that Varsity Revue took up a lot of my time.

Nykolaiszyn

What was Varsity Revue?

Decker

Varsity Revue was a variety show that had group acts and individual
acts. You had to audition. It was sponsored at the time I was here by the
two journalism groups, honorary journalism. Theta Sigma Phi was the
girls, and I believe I’m right that the men’s was Sigma—I don’t want to
say the fraternity, but it was Sigma something. I’m kind of foggy on
that. They sponsored Varsity Revue. It was in the spring, and there was a
committee, a Varsity Revue committee, that was made up of members of
these two journalism groups. The committee would, I think, choose a
director for the Varsity Revue, and then there were committee members
that were in charge of different things. The committee would audition
groups and individuals.
Also, there were girls who would audition to be the Varsity Revue girls.
They were like the Rockettes, Radio City Music Hall. They would wear
lovely short costumes, and they would introduce the Varsity Revue, and

26

then I think they would maybe introduce the second act. It was a real big
undertaking. They sold tickets, and it was a moneymaker. It was very
popular, and it was very well attended. Many of the sororities and
fraternities would try out for their group act. Sometimes the residence
halls would. The year, I think, that I was assistant director, Thatcher
Hall, I believe, had an act. Actually, my future husband was in it, but I
don’t think we were going together at the time. I don’t remember. I
couldn’t tell you exactly. The Varsity Revue would have a theme of
some kind. This committee would decide on a theme, and so the acts
would fit the theme some way. It might be kind of off the wall, but it
would be some relation to the theme. The individual acts would perform
in front of the curtain while you were changing for the next group act.
I think it was Thatcher. It was one of those smaller men’s dorms. All I
remember is that they wore togas made out of bed sheets. It was like the
lost, not country, but under the sea, anyway. (Laughs) It was strange. I
don’t know. They wore togas made out of bed sheets with ropes around
their waist. Some of the acts were pretty elaborate, and usually they
involved music. They would usually write an original song. Somebody
in their organization would be a music major. It was a lot of work for
those of us who did it. I was the assistant director one year, and then I
was the director the next year.
Nykolaiszyn

Where did it take place?

Decker

In the auditorium.

Nykolaiszyn

In Williams Hall? No, couldn’t have been.

Decker

No, what was that? Actually the Seretean Center incorporates what was
the old auditorium.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay.

Decker

I think. I think I read that. I believe I’m right about that.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay.

Decker

It was kind of built around. I think the auditorium was completely
renovated or restructured, rebuilt. That’s where it was held. Alums
would come back, and parents of kids who were in it. It was a big
production. You know, you’d have to have lighting. (Laughs) I
remember one year, and that might have been the year I was the director.
You’d have rehearsals every night for, I don’t know, two weeks
beforehand or something. Somebody designed as the opening, when the
curtain first opened, the opening scene, a fountain in the middle of the

27

stage. Some engineering student helped, I’m sure, with this. It was
hooked up some way so that when the curtain opened, the water would
flow out of the lovely fountain. It was hooked up in some way to the
water supply, I don’t know, so that to make it work you had to flush the
stool in the bathroom in the wings. (Laughs) Somebody had to time it
just right that whoever was working the curtain would say, “We’re
ready,” or whatever. There was somebody down the hall that would
holler at whoever was in the bathroom, “Flush the stool!” (Laughter)
Then the fountain would—it was lovely. You had to have someone back
there telling them when to flush the stool for the water to come up.
Nykolaiszyn

You stayed quite busy.

Decker

Yes, it was fun. I don’t know what I learned from that except how to
work with a lot of people and get something on the stage. I don’t know
now. Sometimes there were fusses going on between groups, like where
they were placed or somebody else was getting better timing. It was
nerve-wracking. It was another learning experience, how to get along
with a lot of people and keep them from fighting each other. (Laughs)
But Varsity Revue, I don’t know how long it went on.

Nykolaiszyn

I don’t know. I’ll have to look that up.

Decker

It hasn’t been going for quite a while, I think, but that was one of the
things we did. It was one of the reasons I didn’t have as good a grade
point average as I could have, but I had a 3.3, so I was all right.

Nykolaiszyn

Good enough to graduate.

Decker

Good enough to graduate. That’s right. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

And where was graduation held?

Decker

Well, I think it was at, what was called then, Lewis Field. I didn’t come
back for graduation, so I wasn’t here for graduation. I finished in
January and got married right after I finished in January and went right
away back up to Indiana with my husband. I didn’t come back for
graduation. I think it was on Lewis Field at that time, what we called
Lewis Field. That’s not that anymore, but that’s where I think it was.

Nykolaiszyn

Would you do anything differently from your college days if you could
go back?

Decker

That’s a good question. Well, that’s a good thought. What would I do
differently? Probably I would, but I don’t know right now, looking back,
what I would do differently, except maybe work harder at my classes.

(Laughs) I went to class, and I had good teachers, and I took good notes.
I kept the notebook from my intermediate algebra class because I
enjoyed that class a lot. A graduate student taught it, and I thought he
was a great teacher. I enjoyed the class so much, and I still have that
notebook just because I enjoyed it. I don’t know. If I had spent more
time doing studies, I couldn’t have done all the extra stuff I did. That
was a big part of my college experience. I came out with a good
education. I remember some really good classes and some really good
teachers.
Nykolaiszyn

Any in particular you’d like to share?

Decker

Well, sure, I could name a few. I mentioned Dr. [Daniel] Kroll who I
had a couple English classes with. I thought he was very good. My
freshman English teacher was really just an adjunct teacher. I think she
later taught at Langston University. Her name was Mrs. Flasch. I
remember her name, and she might’ve been a graduate student or
something. I don’t know, but she was very good and gave me good help
with writing that I used in journalism and my English classes and
everything.
Mr. [James] Stratton was a journalism teacher that I had for several
journalism classes, and he was an interesting person. We used to quote
him up at The O’Colly all the time about how a group of orangutans
could put out the kind of paper we put out that day or something.
(Laughs) He was pretty hard on us sometimes. He did a jazz after hours,
or something like that, program on the radio station that was popular. He
knew a lot about jazz, and my husband used to listen to it because he
liked jazz. He was an interesting person. Who else comes to mind? I
can’t think right quick.
I had a Dr. May for a cultural anthropology class that was very
interesting. Some of these, I didn’t make As in them, but I used to tell
students, “Don’t try so hard to get straight As that you miss out on
classes that might give you more in the long run, that will have more
impact on what you do later or on what you want to learn.” Because
some of the ones that I had that I think I still remember, I didn’t do as
well in as I did in some others. I used to give that advice to students.
Don’t pass up what you think is a hard class that you probably can’t
make an A in just because you want to get straight As because you’ll
miss out on some good preparation for college.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, it’s pretty good advice. (Laughter) It’s a good way to end.
Welcome back to your fiftieth reunion, and we hope you enjoy your time
back on campus. Thank you for interviewing with us today.
