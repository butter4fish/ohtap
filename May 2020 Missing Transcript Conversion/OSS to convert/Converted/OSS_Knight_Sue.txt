About Sue Knight…
Sue Knight was born in Holdenville, Oklahoma in 1933, one of five daughters. She
graduated from Altus High School and attended Hill’s Business University in Oklahoma
City, where she met her husband, Earl. The couple married in 1956. In 1965, while raising
three children, Sue decided to return to college. She enrolled in home economics classes at
Oklahoma State University, and really enjoyed it. She obtained her bachelor’s degree in
home economics and education and also got a teaching certificate in 1969. She substitute
taught for a year and then continued on for a master’s degree in food science. She began
working in food product development during her master’s and then went on for a PhD in
food science, which she completed in 1977. She taught at the Christian Academy of Greater
St. Louis for a while, then returned to Stillwater where she continued her research and taught
Food Science courses. She was a member of Institute of Food Technologists and also
became a registered dietician.
In this interview Sue talks about growing up in Oklahoma, starting college later in life, and
the impact her Oklahoma State University education had on her as well as the impact she
was able to have on others throughout her career here. She also discusses some of the
research projects she was involved with that contributed to increased nutritional content and
preservation.
Sue and Earl have four children, Benita, Amy, John and David. They have six
grandchildren, all of whom are OSU alum or currently enrolled, and three greatgrandchildren, who they enjoy spending time with. They reside in Stillwater but love their
cabin in Creede, Colorado.

Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Latasha Wilson

Stillwater, Oklahoma
Wilson

Today is August 2, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I am with the
Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State
University Library. I am in the home of Sue Knight today visiting with
her about her time growing up and some of her stories for O-STATE
Stories, a project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program.
[Her husband Earl Knight is also sitting in.] Thank you for talking with
me today. Let’s start out by having you tell me when and where you
were born.

S. Knight

All right. I was born in Holdenville, Oklahoma, October 12, 1933. My
official name is Norma Sue Burris. That is what is on my birth
certificate. I never have gone by Norma because that is my mother’s
name. My mother’s name was Norma Burks and my father’s name was
Andrew Burris.

Wilson

Where were you born?

S. Knight

In Holdenville.

Wilson

In a home or in a hospital?

S. Knight

At home. My mother had five daughters and I think all the first three, I
think we were all born at home. I know I was. Then the other two were
later on and they were at the hospital.

Wilson

So where did you fall in the line of children? Were you the third?

S. Knight

I was the middle daughter of five. For many years, I guess five years or
so, I was the baby. A couple of interlopers came in and I wasn’t the baby
anymore. (Laughter)

4

Wilson

How did your parents get to Holdenville?

S. Knight

They came in to Oklahoma. I am not sure what date it was. I know my
father was born, I think, in a wagon after they had come to Oklahoma
and were waiting to get their farm. They came in from Missouri with his
family. Lena Burris and James Burris were his parents. They were all
kind of camped out while they were waiting and would hang their
clothing and such and what they washed, and the ladies would drape
them around places. That came to be called Ragtown. There is still
Ragtown there—what highway is that off of Earl?

E. Knight

75.

S. Knight

Off 75 a few miles out east of Wetumka.

E. Knight

No, I am sorry it is south.

S. Knight

South of Wetumka. Anyway, nobody knows now why it is called
Ragtown.

Wilson

Do you know how long that lasted?

S. Knight

Well, probably not that long because they were getting into homes and
buying farms and such. I think probably a number of his family may
have come too at the same time, or there were certainly a group there.
He was born in 1901. I suspect by 1904 or ’05, all of those people were
probably in houses, but that was when they came in. The closest town to
them was Wetumka. Then my mother’s group, my grandmother and her
family. She was a young bride at the time. Anyway, again it was two or
three families came together. One of the families that came was a widow
named Burks and she had four boys, and my grandmother had married
one of those boys. Then my grandmother’s maiden name was McCray
and she married one of the Burks boys, Andrew Burks. Later on after
they came in, there was some marrying again because she was a widow
when she married, so we wound up with a bunch of double cousins and
things before it all settled out. They were also in Wetumka. As far as I
know they were in one part of the county and my father’s family were in
another part of the county, but my parents met at high school in
Wetumka.

Wilson

Do you know when they got married?

S. Knight

1927. My oldest sister was the same age as my husband.

E. Knight

I was born in ’28.

5

S. Knight

’28. So they must have…

E. Knight

’26 or ’27.

S. Knight

So I think they married in 1927. Anyway, when the parents first came in,
when this group came in their covered wagons actually, coming up from
Texas (this was my mother’s family) they first came into Broken Arrow.
That is where my mother was born, so she was born actually in, and I
think it was already statehood. No it wasn’t statehood yet because she
was born in 1905, so it was still Indian Territory then. Two years before
it was Oklahoma. She was one of six girls and one boy. They only had
one boy to carry on the maiden name. Well, now my grandmother had
been one of nine McCray girls, and so the McCray girls and some of the
Burks boys married, but in both cases as far as we are concerned the
McCray name was lost. Got daughtered out, as they say. My
grandmother had six girls and one boy, and my Uncle Clyde had three
girls. That name, when you are doing genealogy searches suddenly you
kind of come to a block at times like that.
My father, I don’t remember much about the Depression because I was
born in ’33, and I can remember things looking back. I can see that
people were pretty poor, some of aunts or uncles or cousins and moving
in with the ones on the farm and that sort of thing, but I really didn’t
think about it. My dad got a job. He had come up to Oklahoma A&M
and I don’t know whether he had taken some, whether there was kind of
an academy there at this time and if he was there for a while or if he had
to come back when times got hard. But anyway, he was an engineer. So
he got a job at the WPA, and such, helping with the road construction
and different things. I can remember his saying if they were clearing out
to build roads then people would be paid what little amount it was they
would be paid, but he would always have them cut up any lumber or
anything if they had to clear out and people could take it home for
firewood. I don’t remember very much at all about the Depression.

E. Knight

He may have come up here—kind of a high school cadet?

S. Knight

I am not sure.

Wilson

The CCC?

E. Knight

No.

S. Knight

Well he was actually, see there was already the college here and it was
somehow associated with the college, but I don’t know whether it was
something for high school boys or whether he actually had a year or two.

6

Anyway, I know he finished high school, graduated from high school the
same year, and yet he is two and half years older than my mother, so
somewhere in there. I just never did think to try to figure out how to
straighten that all out.
E. Knight

He came up here as an engineer and paved Main Street of Stillwater.

S. Knight

Yes. I was in junior high, I think, then. He was a contractor and built
roads.

Wilson

He paved Main Street in Stillwater?

S. Knight

In Stillwater, yes. I got a picture of that if you want to see it.

Wilson

Yes.

S. Knight

He paved an awful lot of the roads, and then when I am remembering
him, I always remembered him as working for the Highway Department.
He drove a little orange pickup and built a lot of bridges and roads. As I
got older he left the Highway Department and was a contractor and still
built a lot of the bridges and things on our interstates when he first went
in. Some of our best memories I can remember was when Ada, and I was
four or five is when we moved to Ada, and that is where I moved to
grade school. When I was in about the second grade, second or third—I
can’t remember now exactly which it was. I remember Pearl Harbor day.
The Ada Evening News actually came out with an extra. We heard them
going up and down the street.

E. Knight

She worked during the war. You know she was one of those volunteer
workers. (Laughter)

S. Knight

Yes. (Laughter) During third and fourth grade I went around with a
friend. Did I tell you this earlier? We were gathering bacon grease
because you would see all of these posters. You would see a poster of a
lady pouring grease and it wound up pouring down and coming out of a
cannon. Apparently fat like that is an ingredient in manufacturing what
would have been…

E. Knight

Gun powder.

S. Knight

Gun powder. It was a hot day and I had my little wagon and a friend, and
we went around gathering up bacon grease, which splashed all over
everything because it got all melted. Then we were supposed to be able
to turn it in at grocery stores. None of the grocery stores wanted my
grease because none had set up for them to collect it for someone. I
finally got somebody out of pity, I think, took the bacon grease. Anyway

7

that was the war effort that didn’t quite turn out like I thought it would.
But in school, one day a week we would sell the stamps like I showed
you. When you got the little book full that was $17.75.
E. Knight

$17.50 I think.

S. Knight

$17.50 to feel up one of those…

E. Knight

$25.00 book

S. Knight

…and then it would mature as a $25.00 bond.

E. Knight

I still have some.

S. Knight

Anyway, that was an interesting thing to do, because everybody was
involved.

E. Knight

Too bad you can’t get this. (Laughs)

Wilson

Do you remember your parents doing anything?

S. Knight

Well my dad, having five daughters and was probably in his forties by
then, so there was never a problem with him being drafted. But he was
involved in a lot of road building and things like what needed to be done
to keep—we still have, but we definitely then had quite a few—well I
know Altus and Norman and Enid and McAlester, and how many places
did we have military bases or plants or factories or something? In
Oklahoma City there was Douglas Manufacturing…

E. Knight

I worked out at Tinker Field.

S. Knight

And Tinker Field. There was just a lot that had to be done in Oklahoma
at that time. I remember we had moved to Ardmore. I went to junior
high at Ardmore. Finished elementary school in Ada and junior high in
Ardmore, and I remember sitting out on the swing in the front yard and
hearing a lot of honking one afternoon. It was V-E Day, Europe.

E. Knight

Was it V-E Day…

S. Knight

No, I think it was…

E. Knight

…or Normandy?

S. Knight

No. It was…

E. Knight

V-E Day? They were celebrated.

8

S. Knight

Both of them were celebrated, but it was the day that was victory in
Europe. I am not sure. It was some months after that before Japan
surrendered.

E. Knight

Quite a bit. At least three months.

S. Knight

I don’t remember where I was then, but I just remember we were out
several blocks from downtown and I heard this honking, then realized
what it was. That was before television or everything.

Wilson

So it sounds like were you kind of a city girl growing up? Lived in town?

S. Knight

Well sort of. I lived in town the whole time. I never lived in a big city
though because by the time I got to high school we had moved again. I
went to high school in Altus but the war was over then. The house we
had in Altus was one that was built. There was an air force base that had
been there. They’d go in and build a bunch of nice houses, small houses.
Just two bedroom and such but they were…

E. Knight

Wartime housing.

S. Knight

Wartime house is what it had been built for, but the war was over, and I
graduated from high school. I was salutatorian of my class.

Wilson

How many were in your class? Do you remember?

S. Knight

We had a very small class. We were kind of known for that. For some
reason or other there was just sixty-seven or sixty-nine in our graduating
class. There were three hundred in the high school, which was three
grades, so our class was kind of small. Then my parents moved to
Oklahoma City. Some time went by, and I didn’t want to take practical
things when I was in high school like how to type. (Laughs) Things like
that. Things that I knew I wouldn’t be good at. So I am in Oklahoma
City and in order to get a job I was going to Hill’s Business University.
This fellow had come back from the marines and I think the typing
teacher was trying to do a little matchmaking, but anyway she had me go
up and show that fellow how to set the tab on his typewriter.

E. Knight

That’s right, but that is your excuse [not] for the first date but for the
second date. (Laughter)

S. Knight

Well, I just sat down behind him in case he had any more trouble setting
the tab.

Wilson

What was that fellow’s name?

9

S. Knight

That fellow’s name was Earl. (Laughs) But we dated for some time.

E. Knight

For almost three years.

S. Knight

He had to finish his and I finished and got to where I was working as a
stenographer.

E. Knight

Making more money than me.

S. Knight

Yeah, I went to work for the company that wound up after several name
changes to be Amoco, which is now taken over by British Petroleum.
Anyway, I guess I worked for about three years. But we got around to
being married.

E. Knight

We went to work first. The old Standard Oil Company.

S. Knight

Yes. Standard Oil was what it was then.

E. Knight

Then it became part of Amoco.

S. Knight

There are kind of a couple of interesting stories about this. I had a job
while I was going to business school. I worked for a real estate
company. I had a job delivering various papers, contracts, deeds, that
sort of thing to different places there in downtown Oklahoma City. My
office was in the First National building. I was a file clerk and would
have to run around all over the downtown delivering these things. Just
worked afternoons, but it was kind of important for me to tell time to get
back from some of these. I had never had a wrist watch of any kind so I
went into to B.C. Clark and they were having their anniversary sale. I
bought a watch. I think the watch cost nineteen dollars. It was a beautiful
little Bulova.

E. Knight

Gold case.

S. Knight

Yeah. It was a nice little thing. They let me pay it out at five dollars a
month. I think I got it paid off early, I believe. So then some time went
past and Earl and I decided to get married. We were going to buy a
house so we went in to buy a house. We were going to get it on the G.I.
Bill. We had trouble getting the mortgage because neither one of us had
credit.

E. Knight

No credit.

S. Knight

Neither one of us had ever borrowed any money. Everything was just
cash. Then I remembered my wrist watch. (Laughter) So that is the way

10

we qualified for a loan. (Laughter) One of us had a credit rating. I
thought that was funny. You can see he and I feel the same way about
being in debt. (Laughter)
E. Knight

It was a real nice house.

S. Knight

It is still, if you drive through that part of Warr Acres, it was called, in
Oklahoma City. It is still a nice house.

Wilson

How long did you live there?

S. Knight

We moved from there in…

E. Knight

Four years.

S. Knight

Yeah, probably about four or five years.

E. Knight

Benita started school.

S. Knight

Benita started school. We had Amy and we had John, then Earl got a job
with the Department of Agriculture being an auditor and we moved to
Woodward.

E. Knight

We were there four years.

S. Knight

We were there four years but he had to…

E. Knight

Travel.

S. Knight

So this was the first time that I had ever had to spend nights without him.
That was something. We moved into this house and this was just a few
years after that Woodward tornado.

Wilson

’47?

S. Knight

Well, it had been more than a few years, but anyway the town…

E. Knight

The tornado was in ’48.

Wilson

I think ’47.

E. Knight

’47 or ’48. I don’t remember, but it was right in there somewhere, the
worst tornado Oklahoma ever had, casualty[-wise].

S. Knight

The house we had, had been destroyed in the tornado and it was rebuilt.
Except that when they rebuilt the house, now the family that was there,

11

they had run down in the basement and so they all survived. But they
rebuilt the house and they decided they wanted it a little bigger. On one
side of the house where the bedrooms were, they just went out and
poured another foundation and built the house out there. Somehow or
another that part tended to settle, so here I am and down that hallway
from the bedrooms you could just hear somebody walking as the house
would settle.
E. Knight

She thought it was a ghost. (Laughter)

S. Knight

I mean, I was terrified. I slept with a .22 beside me. I know it was just
the sound of this house. Then we got a cow dog. Her name was Gina and
she was a really, really nice dog but she would prowl up and down that
hall, and I knew all I was hearing was Gina’s toenails. That was the main
thing I remember about that whole thing. I could sleep and I could sleep
in peace and I knew that dog was going to protect me. Then we moved
to Stillwater in ’64?

E. Knight

’64.

S. Knight

We put one daughter in junior high.

E. Knight

She moved to Stillwater. I had arrived here and then moved back over to
Arkansas. Do you remember Billie Sol Estes? I got in on all of those
investigations that they were having. It was a big thing that happened
back then in agriculture, so I had just left home.

S. Knight

But we did very well and we lived on North Husband. He was traveling
so much that our summers we just walked out and traveled with him.
The kids learned to swim in the motel pools.

E. Knight

One of us worked and the others loafed.

S. Knight

Sometimes I would take my sewing machine with me, but we had really,
really nice summers and really enjoyed the kids. We were all together as
a family for the whole summer. So the traveling, and every time Earl
could get home on weekends, of course he did. It was pretty nice the fact
he had to travel so much but we were together so much during the
summers that we enjoyed.

E. Knight

I would get through to the kids.

Wilson

Would you drive from place to place?

S. Knight

Yes, strictly because for being the Department of Agriculture you were
almost always going to rural areas, and so it was driving. He drove so

12

many [miles] that usually every year he had to buy a car. We had a car
for me and bought it while we were in Woodward. It was a Plymouth.
What was the age of it?
E. Knight

Ooh.

S. Knight

It was fairly old then.

E. Knight

Fairly old. ’50s. You bought a Chrysler, didn’t you?

S. Knight

It was a Plymouth, but it was the Chrysler- Plymouth dealer is where we
bought it.

E. Knight

Yeah, but it was a Chrysler wasn’t it? That was a Chrysler.

S. Knight

No, the grey one was a Plymouth. The white and red one was the
Chrysler that Benita liked to drive, but that was later. Anyway, this was
an old car and our son John at this time was about five or six, he was
ashamed of that car. As we would be driving down Duck Street he
would like to roll down the window and yell, “My dad drives a Ford,”
whatever it was, Ford 500, but this is up-to-date car and it really
bothered John that he had to ride in the bad one.

E. Knight

She never got of town with it.

S. Knight

I got tired of being the only adult alone for most of the time. So I
decided to go to college.

E. Knight

With three kids.

S. Knight

And I enrolled in home economics and wasn’t really sure I could, real
trepidation about coming back to school because I was an older woman
by that time and all those young kids. I thought, ‘How can I hold my
own with all these kids?’ So I only enrolled in ten hours my first
semester. I made two A’s and a B. I thought, ‘Man, that is good.’

E. Knight

What was the B from?

S. Knight

What was the B from?

E. Knight

I think it was the only B you ever made.

S. Knight

Only B I have ever made. (Laughter) Oh, there was a humanities teacher
that I didn’t get along with once.

E. Knight

Is that when you took bow and arrow, something?

13

S. Knight

That is right, archery. I didn’t do well.

Wilson

Before this did you get an associate’s degree from the business college
or did you just take classes?

S. Knight

No, what I did was I just took classes until I got a job. Just went in and
tested for the job and was able to do it, but I knew business was not the
field for me to go in.

E. Knight

(Laughter) I could out-type her, but she had a good business sense.

S. Knight

Yes I did, but I knew I wasn’t good at things like typing, and I could
learn the shorthand fine, but building up speed. I guess I did alright.

E. Knight

Yes you did.

S. Knight

I am not sure where I was going with that. Oh yeah. That was my first
[semester], and I kept going until I got three degrees.

E. Knight

She had no credit hours toward college. She had three kids. One was in
high school.

S. Knight

When I started I think she was still in junior high.

Wilson

So what year did you enroll at OSU?

S. Knight

1965, I think. I figured it would take me a long time to graduate and I
graduated in ’69.

Wilson

With a degree in…?

S. Knight

Home economics, education and did get the teacher’s certificate along
with it. Then I decided…

E. Knight

You did teach, didn’t you, for a while.

S. Knight

No, I did a lot of substitute teaching for a year after that. Then I decided
to go on and get my master’s, and did that, did research.

E. Knight

Dairy science.

S. Knight

Dairy science. My master’s degree. Got a food science degree in the
Diary Science Department. Dr. Jim Mickle was my advisor in that.

E. Knight

Real nice fellow.

14

Wilson

What year did you start your master’s? How soon after your
bachelor’s?

E. Knight
’70 I guess, wasn’t it, Sue?
S. Knight
It wasn’t long.
E. Knight
She just turned right around. She decided she could do it.
S. Knight
Then I went on into and got involved in food product development
during my master’s. Then went on to get my PhD and was working
with… I did interesting things with yeast in my master’s degree and we
were trying to grow yeast on cheese whey.
Wilson
On cheese whey?
S. Knight
Yeah. Because it was a real waste product then and we met a fellow at
one of the dairy meetings and he was then owner of the Watonga cheese
plant. He was having a terrible time getting rid of his whey when he
would make cheese, because only mammals can eat milk sugar and so
you couldn’t feed the whey to chickens. It would kill them. Dogs, pigs
could handle whey but even cows you couldn’t feed them very much of
the sugar. I am not sure why cows couldn’t, but nonetheless there was a
real problem with how to get rid of that cheese whey. He had been
spraying it on fields as fertilizer. One day one of the people who were
supposed to carry the cheese whey off decided to quit early and went
and dumped it in the North Canadian River and killed fish all the way to
Oklahoma City. He was afraid he would be subject to a real lawsuit
except I don’t think they ever figured out who dumped it. It was a
problem so we were trying to figure out a use for it.
So this is what Dr. Mickel was doing but we did find out most yeasts
don’t like milk lactose either, so I wrote to the American Type Culture
Collection. Which all of that is organisms, you know, if you are wanting
to do some research or something with an organism they have these so
you can get them. There was only one kind of yeast that they had there
that was both recognized as a human food source because that was going
to be pretty important to us and could ferment lactose, so we had that.
Now this is some years go by, but that is a little interesting thing about
that. I started back and got my degree and for some years we went to St.
Louis. Came back and I got a job at Oklahoma State University teaching
my favorite classes. I was just thrilled and was involved in research.
E. Knight
In the interim you did get your PhD, and while we were in St. Louis they
did hire you to teach.

15

S. Knight
Oh yeah, I taught at Christian Academy of Greater St. Louis. Taught
high school.
Wilson
After you had your PhD?
S. Knight
Yeah.
Wilson
What was your PhD in?
S. Knight
It was also in food science.
E. Knight
What did you teach?
S. Knight
But I got it in the School of Home Economics. I taught everything. They
decided at the Christian Academy of Greater St. Louis—it was a private
religious school and kids got bused in from all over. They thought
nobody associated with the school had a PhD and I had finished and
gotten mine and so they assumed I could teach anything so I did. I did
teach a home economics class, I taught math to seventh and eighth
graders, and I taught science to seventh and eighth graders and biology
to juniors and something else to seniors.
Wilson
Was that all at the same time?
S. Knight
All at the same time. (Laughter)
Wilson
Oh, my goodness.
S. Knight
That was kind of funny. Well, if you got that you can teach anything.
(Laughs) I didn’t teach religion but…
Wilson
Had you gone on straight from your master’s to start your PhD?
S. Knight
Yes. I did.
Wilson
Do you remember what year you finished your PhD?
S. Knight
’77.
E. Knight
’73, I believe, is when you got your diplomas.
Wilson
For her master’s?
E. Knight
Because we moved to St. Louis.
S. Knight

16

That was something I was going to check for you before you came back.
I forgot to get those actual dates.
E. Knight
I believe we moved to St. Louis in ’70. I moved before you did because I
had to get up there and get a house. I believe you came up right after
school was out.
S. Knight
But I had to finish writing my thesis dissertation and then go back for
my orals.
E. Knight
Something like that.
S. Knight
But anyway.
Wilson
What was your dissertation on?
S. Knight
Dr. Winterfeldt had gotten a large grant from the Department of
Agriculture to try to establish a relationship with dietary chromium and
diabetes. That was what I worked on and put in a lot of time. We just
never really could document a strong relationship there.
E. Knight
When you got your dietetics… Let’s see, what do you call it when you
become a registered dietician?
S. Knight
Yeah. I became a registered dietician, too. We really got a better
relationship. What we were doing, we were analyzing hair. Some
researcher had determined that dietary chromium could wind up in hair,
so then we tried to establish there was a relationship between the amount
of hair and what was in the hair and the others. But the chromium was so
hard to analyze in such small amounts. About a year or two after I was
through, they came out with equipment that could really measure in parts
per billion, and that is really what your needed for the chromium. So we
just looked at several other minerals too, and I got a pretty good
relationship between zinc and the hair and the diet. We were collecting
food and everything, had the students keep track of what they were
eating. Which is pretty easy when we had all these kids that were eating
in the dorms, but what we started out to do we weren’t able to do. I was
doing this work for her as part of that.
I got to do some teaching, and so I had experience in teaching. Anyway,
I was going to go back now. I am back now and I am going to work for
the university. I got my lab over in the old building and we are doing
things. I was a member of the food technologist, IFT [Institute of Food
Technologists]. We were touring different food things here in the state
and Phillips Petroleum was trying to get into some food manufacturing.
They had set off another spin-off company called Provesta, which was

17

doing their food, and so those Provesta people had become members of
the IFT. I was president that year of the IFT section and we set up a tour
of the Bartlesville plant where they had worked out a way to actually
grow yeast starting with petroleum. It was an interesting thing to do, but
it is all hydro carbons no matter which way you are going. So they had
ripped that away to develop this yeast that they were growing. Anyway,
we did a tour of their lab and I went in to where they were drawing and
experimenting with different kinds of yeast and I said, “You’re growing
kluyveromyces in cheese whey.” You could tell by the smell, and also I
had seen a box over here that had dry yeast and dry whey. They had dry
whey they were using and they were doing this. The fellow looked kind
of funny and he said, “You’re not a…” What did he call it, kind of a
spy? That was supposed to be a real secret what they were doing.
(Laughter) So anyway, I mean, I worked with that in my master’s and so
of course I knew that was the only yeast they could be using because that
was the only one that was rated for human consumption. I would see
them in these big things full of dried whey. Anyway, I kind of impressed
them. I got a grant from them to develop food uses for this yeast they
were doing. At that time, it seems like my first grant I got was almost for
I think $100,000, and the dean and the department head were just
(gasps). That was, at that time, the biggest grant they’d ever received.
Wilson
Who was the dean and the department head at that time?
S. Knight
The dean was, oh the name is not coming to me. The department head
was Esther Winterfeldt.
E. Knight
Was the other gal’s name Barbara? Who was that?
S. Knight
No. I’ll look it up. I know her very well. There has just been one other
dean after her. Since I have retired there is another dean over there now.
That was kind of a funny thing, because that really set me up. They
wound up at the dean. I was over in the old Home Economics Building,
and it just really was not a very good, well it was kind of falling down.
So anyway, developed one of the basement labs, really large lab, that I
could teach both of my experimental foods class in and continue
whatever research I was doing.
E. Knight
Tell her about the yeast they come up with.
S. Knight
Well, we put it in a ‘meal on the go’ bar, took it to different things. We
had another thing that worked in, really was something we called potato
puffs. We would take instant potato. There is very little protein in
potatoes. But kids love potatoes, particularly fried. Some of my graduate
students we would work together and they made something that was
called potato puffs. We put the yeast in it. This was a nice, mild flavored

18

yeast, so it wasn’t real strong. Started with instant potatoes and had that
in there, and so it really improved the food value of what would be like a
french fry. What you would do was use the inside of a doughnut cutter.
We took the little center thing that cut that out. We would make those
and fry them, and that’s one thing that the Phillips Provesta people liked
real well and they wanted to take it to one of their food shows.
Carla, she was making these and she would take one and she would slap
her hand and knock it out of the little thing. There is no way. They
wanted thousands of those things to take to a food show. The Phillips
people bought us a cookie cutter. You could fill this vat with the stuff
and it extruded it through and it worked with Bama to make it
something, Bama pies, so that they could be extruded and put out there.
So we were making some of these. We got the cookie cutter and filled
the vat. They had to mix up a big batch of it. They put it in there and it
mixed it up and it extruded it.
One very, very hot day we decided we better fry them. You see, we had
gone from little batches of 100 grams of potato up to these huge
amounts. So we took it in the lab and there was a salesman or something
coming in and wanted to talk to me. One of these students come out and
her eyes are just like this and she says, “Dr. Knight! They are
exploding!” So I went in and they were exploding. They were flying all
over that old building. (Laughter) Apparently, I didn’t know there was
any gluten in potatoes and it was developing something in that extra
mixing that was developing toughness.
E. Knight
They added quite a bit of protein.
S. Knight
Well yeah, but there is no gluten in protein. Whatever it was, each one of
them was flying into three pieces. The top and a bottom and still a soggy
middle. They were just going all over the lab. I looked and all we could
really do was just let them all pop. There wasn’t any lid or anything. I
crawled under a table and reached up and got some aluminum foil and
myself made a shield to put over the top. (Laughter) The students were
really impressed. All we could do was just let them all pop, but at least
they were contained. I bet when we moved out of that lab if you looked
close enough you could still find pieces of potato puff. (Laughter) We
got them.
E. Knight
They were delicious.
S. Knight
But all we had to do was we had to measure up 100 gram batches, give
them just the right amount of mixing, put that one little thing in there
and extrude it. So we had to have an assembly line. Start off with these
small amounts and put them in there and the mixing and then go

19

through. That was the only way we figured how to do it on such short
notice.
E. Knight
Tell her what you were going to do with them.
S. Knight
For this meeting what they were wanting to do was they wanted to set up
in a fancy hotel suite and invite all the people that were coming to this
IFT convention that was starting and invite people. They wanted to serve
these potato puffs as something they were doing. Of course, we couldn’t
have them flying all over. They did tell us later that apparently one batch
that we had already mixed up had gotten in accidently and it did. I had
warned them, you know.
E. Knight
She took them to Atlanta and it was very well received. The idea was to
sell them to old folks’ homes because they would up the protein content.
S. Knight
As well as to school children.
Wilson
How would you package them?
E. Knight
Like popcorn.
S. Knight
They would just be packaged, and my thought was fried on sight. Like
your frozen french fries and things. But anyway, Provesta sold off a part
of that and then I had also done a ‘meal on the go’ bar, which was going
very well. The company that bought that off called me and they wanted
me to make all kinds of nutritional claims. I guess because of these
health food stores or something. Well no, I approved the protein content
and I made it a better food, but it wasn’t anything magic. I don’t know
where it went from there.
E. Knight
When we went to Creede, There was a guy selling them up there at a
store there. He said it was the only kind of breakfast bars he liked. It
kind of flattered me there. He didn’t even know you developed them.
Tell them about the other products you made so well, biscuits. We would
go to Ole Rabbit Ears down there and eat biscuits. Those were your
biscuits.
S. Knight
Oh. (Laughs) You see, I had worked with Bama Pies and the lady there
at Bama Pies that did their new product development—this is our Tulsa
Bama Pies. Anyway I got a telephone call one day and they came in and
said, “She has told us we want to start making biscuits.” They were
doing a lot of work with McDonald’s and they wanted to start making
biscuits for McDonald’s. I said, “Well, I can give you my biscuit recipe
but I see two things wrong with it. I am used to making it in small
batches and to make it in a big batch you will have to do a lot of

20

experimenting with it. I will give you my recipe and I’ll tell you what it
is. It’s just a standard recipe for biscuits, but first off, let me tell you if I
don’t have buttermilk, I don’t make biscuits.” Then I just gave the
standard thing, but my recipe is two teaspoons of baking powder, quarter
teaspoon of soda, cup of buttermilk, two cups of flour and some
shortening to cut in. That is it, but that is a pretty standard recipe. I told
them I know you can buy dry buttermilk, but I have not had much luck
with it. I just didn’t see having gone through an operation how they
could adapt my recipe to what they wanted to do. About six months later
again the IFT was taking a tour and we were going through Bama Pies. I
walked in there and there was a silo, it looked like, that was two or three
stories high of buttermilk. Cold, chilled buttermilk. So they did it. I
haven’t heard any more whether they’re still making those but my
grandson says he loves their biscuits.
Wilson
At McDonald’s?
S. Knight
Yeah, at McDonald’s. He was real smug about it and then I told him I
gave them the recipe. I have no idea what changes they had to make but
they did taste like mine. All the other places I go that have biscuits now,
I can taste the baking powder in it. They use too much. They want to try
to make them lighter. Maybe it’s I’m tasting soda. I don’t know,
whatever it is, there’s something in there to me that interferes with the
flavor. According to my grandson, and I have never gone in and gotten
McDonald’s breakfast biscuits. I guess I need to, but he keeps saying.
E. Knight
They are still your recipe. You like to downplay what you did. These
days you sell things like that, but in those days you gave it away.
S. Knight
Well it was just a standard recipe. There wasn’t anything precious about
it. It was just that they took my word for it that it wouldn’t be the same if
you didn’t have the real buttermilk. (Laughter)
Wilson
So over time, doing all this work, have you really developed your taste
buds?
S. Knight
I guess. That was another thing we would always do. Anytime you have
foods classes, or particularity experimental or anything, you do try to do
some sensory evaluation and develop the techniques for sensory
evaluation.
E. Knight
You had classes on it.
S. Knight
We didn’t have classes on it. I never did feel like I was….
E. Knight
Mom, quit being so dang modest. I have gone to those classes.

21

(Laughter) I was recruited, and you’d have big classes on it.
S. Knight
Well, yeah.
E. Knight
The people enjoyed it. And also you didn’t mention the fact that it was
you and your students that really helped that guy with Head Country. He
came over here, too. I wish you would claim some credit for that and
after all, I helped taste test it. (Laughter)
Wilson
What is your Head Country story?
S. Knight
Well, see this again, I am not sure, because this is actually for a
company that could name. Danny Head, the owner of Head Country, has
this barbeque sauce and it is good barbeque sauce. There was a certain
brand of ketchup he used and they were going to double almost the price
of the ketchup, and that is the basic ingredient. Anyway, he had to
develop a substitute for the ketchup, because he just didn’t want to have
to pay that much. He had tried all the other ketchup brands. His
customers could tell a difference and would pick up phones and say,
“What have you done to your ketchup?” All we were wanting was the
flavor, not the texture. He just wanted the flavor. One of my graduate
students at that time lived at Ponca City. She sat up this, trained her
panelists, and they tried to get all the ingredients. Then what’s on the
label will tell you what’s in there but not the amount and all of that. She
had to work with the ingredients that were there and come up with a
substitute for that ketchup.
E. Knight
This is a young lady, inexperienced, being tutored by…
S. Knight
This is beside the point. That is your job as a director of a graduate
student. Anyway she put them together. I don’t think I would have been
sensitive enough to pick up this, but sure enough, she got a ketchup that
the taste was there. So then he came up with his other secret ingredients
and put it together with the brand name product and with theirs, and they
couldn’t tell the difference. So he went back to them and said, “Sorry, I
don’t need your ketchup anymore.” Suddenly they decided they could
sell their ketchup to him at the price they had been, which was probably
better than what it cost him to try and put it together himself. So
somewhere he has got that recipe down. (Laughter) If the ketchup people
give him any more problems… But he did, when this girl graduated, he
hired her to help develop some of his others, like the smoke. Anyway, he
has got two or three different flavors now that they have.
Wilson

So for something like that, is that just part of the land grant mission, to
help other people?

22

S. Knight

That is kind of the way I viewed it. A lot of people charged a lot. He
would have paid me something, but as an individual I thought no, that is
part of the four things of…

E. Knight

Some lady out west you did that for.

S. Knight

Yeah, I have done an awful lot of things like that…

E. Knight

Okie Girls, or the Okie Ladies, trying to get into their own business.

S. Knight

We work with them, because if you go from a small amount to a large
amount it is… One lady was trying to start, and did start, selling her
cookies. I don’t know how well it did, but her grandmother made the
very, very best cookies. She came up and we presented her problem to
my Experimental Foods class. She said, “I have seen my grandmother
make her cookies. I copy them exactly. She will write out a recipe for
me. I try to copy it and I simply never can.” So we had some students
take on this as a challenge to try to just start with the basic recipe as
Grandma gave it. She said, “But let me tell you the problem that I have.
One day I said, ‘Mom, I am going to follow everything you say and each
thing as you measure it out, I am going to carefully weigh and try to get
exactly how much it was.’” Like she would use a teacup instead of a
regular cup so she would be trying then to put that in a regular cup so
she would have something, other than stealing her grandmother’s teacup.
She is doing it all and she is trying to get it together. So she said add the
salt. So she put the salt in there. She tried to figure out exactly how
much salt was in there, so Mom helped her figure out how much salt was
there. Then, Mom went over here took a pinch of salt and dumped the
rest in the sink. (Laughter) She said, “We realized, Yes! Any of her
recipes are going to be hard to follow.” But they did work with them and
she tried to describe what it was in the recipe as best she could and use
all the techniques they had learned in this class. There wasn’t anything
magic about it but still they put that together.
Other people had their pickles. They were all spoiling because they
would get yeast in them. I found out, I said, “Well you are not heating it
enough.” They said, “We don’t heat them at all. We don’t even have a
stove.” I said, “Well, you are just going to be out of business, because
you do have to. You obviously have yeast contamination.” They thought
they had so much vinegar in the pickles, but yeast can tolerate an awful
lot, and so they had to kind of pasteurize it. In other words they didn’t –
it was just things like that. Then one of my graduate students worked
with it to try to determine exactly how much heat they would have to
have, take it and culture it to see if they caught them all. We did things
like that, but I really enjoyed doing that. People got to where they would

23

call from all over. I think then they put in the….
E. Knight

Yeah, your students enjoyed working on actual projects.

S. Knight

(Laughs) We kind of got in trouble once, or close. Caffeine is extremely
bitter, so when we are doing sensory evaluation there is sour, bitter,
sweet, salty, so you have a control for each of those, which was going to
be your sour, bitter, sweet, salty. Well, we would usually use sucrose for
our sweet because that is the most common sugar that we use. We had
these different things that we used for each of these. What we use, and
this is standard throughout the industry, for bitter is caffeine. We just use
tiny amounts of it to make your standards. Do you remember where I am
going with this now? Oh yes. Okay. So anyway the kids got to thinking
they knew that a lot of their friends all they did was have a cup of coffee
before they came to class. They thought they would do better if they at
least had something with some food value in it besides just the coffee.
They said, “Could we put caffeine in a muffin?” I thought that was
innovative. “Yeah. Try it. Go for it. You can’t put in very much or it is
going to start tasting bitter.” They set it up and they did their experiment.
They got a muffin recipe they tried and everybody liked it. Then they
started trying to see how much caffeine they could get in with it. What
they were aiming would be the equivalent of caffeine that you could get
in a cup of coffee. Sure enough, they can make it and get it sweet, and it
worked. Well then somebody picked up on what we were doing, came in
and interviewed us. I think Tulsa picked it up. So in the newspaper and
on the radio, and oh, did we start getting complaints. Well, it was better
for them than the cup of coffee. Oh, you are trying to put caffeine in all
of this. Well anyway, some things do not rebound to your glory.
(Laughter) But I thought the kids did a good job and it was a good idea.

Wilson

What are some classes that you taught?

S. Knight

I taught just what we call Science of Food Prep. That was a class where
—I loved that class as an undergraduate. I loved that class because it
tells you what happens, like why does broccoli turn a strange color when
you cook it. Any of the green vegetables, what you can do to keep that
from happening. The affect of different flours, like bread flour and cake
flour and all purpose flour, and what happens if you bake like a biscuit
out of all those three, or what if you tried to make a cake out of all of
those three. In class you could have enough people there that you would
assign different ones and then you evaluate them and you see it. Just
learn what happens in food and why some starches don’t freeze.
If you make a pudding out of certain starches and you take it out and if
you have frozen it like for dessert or something that you want, some of

24

them are awful. All they do is run water. If you put regular cornstarch or
flour to thicken a pie, or if you have made an apple pie and you decided
to freeze it, save it for Thanksgiving and it is all soggy when you get it
out, it’s because you have starch that separates when you freeze it and
the water comes out. Not all starches do that. Tapioca doesn’t. Waxy
potato starch. Anyway, those are the kinds of things that if you are going
into a restaurant or something where you might be wanting to freeze
something, that is something you need to know. There, too, we would
have people like from Bama, I really had a good relationship with them,
come over and talk to us and tell us how their suppliers for certain kinds
of starches for whatever it was they were wanting to do. I just loved that
class, and I loved to teach it because it was so practical in what you
could do.
Wilson

Sounds fun.

S. Knight

Yeah.

E. Knight

She would have like the Cain’s coffee people come in as part of the class
and give lectures about coffee.

S. Knight

They loved to do it, because they knew some of these people were going
into restaurants. It was just practical knowledge and things that you
knew but didn’t know. One of my best, greatest things I think, impact I
had, see about the time I got through all of this and started teaching, I
was already at about the age of when I started wanting to do something.
I would see these women coming in who would be in their mid-forties
maybe, divorced and suddenly they were out and their self-esteem
wasn’t very high and they really didn’t think they could hack it. Well I
knew they could, because you got so many life situations and things that
when you come into school you are way ahead of those freshmen as far
as what decisions to make and things like that. Anyway, they would
come in and sometimes they would really be low and they would love
that kind of class. Knowing there is some of this and then too I would
love to talk with them and let them know I came in as a later student and
did fine.

Wilson

Can we talk about that a little more? When you started school your first
semester went well…

S. Knight

Yeah.

Wilson

But what about your first day on campus? What were you feeling?

S. Knight

Strange, out of place, excited.

25

Wilson

How old were you? In your early thirties?

S. Knight

No, late thirties.

Wilson

Late thirties.

E. Knight

I would say so.

S. Knight

I think I started ’65. Then it wasn’t a matter of going on and getting an
advanced degree so I could do something. I was just starting from
scratch.

E. Knight

She was about thirty-three years old, I think.

S. Knight

But I still had time for that, and I could have. I retired at sixty-five just
because I wanted to, and you could retire at sixty-five. Earl had already
started having some health problems and I just wanted to so we could
travel and do things. I really probably should have taught two more
years. You don’t think you can do that anymore but when your age and
your years taught come out to eighty, or something like that, you can get
full retirement, and I lacked two years.

Wilson

How was it being a young mother with your husband gone some
traveling and going to school? How do you balance all of those?

S. Knight

Well, probably too, if anything it hurt the children, because I know there
would be times that I was in the house. I tried to schedule my classes so
that I would be home particularly when they were little, but I was home
in body. I would be writing a paper or I would be studying for
something. I was there in the house. I wasn’t in class but I was there and
Earl was gone. I am afraid that the fact that I was just there in body but
maybe not getting enough involvement. None of them ever acted like
they didn’t get enough of my attention.

E. Knight

Fortunately we had an older daughter and then we had a middle daughter
which is five years younger and then we had the little boy, so they would
supervise.

Wilson

The older girls helped out?

S. Knight

Yes. We still shared the work. At home, we always shared the work. We
didn’t expect Mom to do it all, but a lot of times I would do a lot of work
after they were asleep. Looking back that is one thing that bothers me.
Particularly, they say often times the middle child is the one that gets left
out, and I kind of think my middle child could have used a little bit more
of my attention. (Laughs) She doesn’t complain about it now. Things

26

like that.
E. Knight

Benita matured.

S. Knight

Well the older child, she just took over and did things.

Wilson

So you were in college at the same time as some of your children when
you were working on your advanced degrees?

S. Knight

Yes. As a matter of fact, David, our fall crop, our late child, the one that
I was getting pretty close to forty when he was born, he was much
younger than the others when I was working on my PhD. That was
interesting too.

E. Knight

But Benita was…

S. Knight

Well Amy was the one that raised David pretty much. Because Benita
had gotten married.

E. Knight

What I remember was she would tell us she was in competition with her
mother because she was in college and making not as good of grades as
her mother. (Laughter) We had to have a lecture about that.

S. Knight

But that was a good thing that the kids didn’t need to feel like I was in
competition with them.

Wilson

What is some advice you would give to older students who are just
starting out? You mentioned women that have come back when they are
ready to start again.

S. Knight

Several would come back later and tell me that it had been a real... Most
of these women were women who had been in a divorce. Maybe the
husband had gone on and gotten a degree and probably they had put him
through for a degree. They were intelligent women. I knew they were,
they just thought, “Oh, I am so far behind.” And usually I just tell about
me, that I started back and look. They all thought of me as being one of
their best teachers anyway. That was just great encouragement to them.

E. Knight

What about Marilyn? Everything you’re talking about, look where she’s
at.

S. Knight

Oh yeah, I think she may be department chair down at Edmond now. But
that was really all they needed. They are better off than the kids are.
They may know a thing about computers, they may have had higher
math than you have had but you have so much more maturity, and you
are not worried a whole lot about if the fellow sitting behind you is real

27

cute and things like that. You can really devote yourself to learning and
get in an area you like. I don’t know of a single returning student that
didn’t do well.
Wilson

How many students do you think you have taught?

S. Knight

I don’t know.

Wilson

Do you know how many you have advised in graduate degrees?

S. Knight

Oh, probably twenty, twenty-five. Some of them were international
students, some not. I was blessed with having really good students, so
they did well and they could do these things on their own. Like the girls
that develop the procedure for really trying to help people with the
testing. I didn’t have time to do all that, but they were good and if you
are really working toward a degree they need to have the responsibility
and do it. You are there if they are completely doing it wrong or getting
off or whatever, but I always had such good graduate students.
You can get a research assistantship or a teaching assistantship. When
you are applying for jobs, sometimes the teaching assistantship is
viewed better for a lot of jobs you are applying for. I am not sure why. I
would see to it whether they were on—like your teaching assistantships
were usually through the department and paid through the college. My
research assistantships I usually had enough research money coming in
that I paid for them a lot myself, which was one reason why a lot of
these researchers if they are struggling along with just one assistant that
is paid for, he can’t get as much done. But if you got good ones, but you
are spending an awful lot of time guiding these people. Because then
that is your chore to guide them, and they are supposed to be learning
how to do all of this, and they need to be accepting their responsibility
too, but I have had really good ones.

E. Knight

Little miss what’s her name? Is she a dean there?

S. Knight

She is something. She is a dean or vice president or something of a
school in Indiana now.

E. Knight

Marylyn is what? She has these people strategically placed all over. In
really fine positions.

Wilson

And you still hear from former students?

S. Knight

Yes. I want to show you something from a former student. I had totally
forgotten about this girl. Not completely, because she would every once
in a while call me and say something. She had come up last year and she

28

was representing, I guess, her twenty-fifth year or something, I don’t
know what. She called and they called me and said this girl said she
wouldn’t come if I wasn’t going to be there for their fall [event]. Having
Homecoming you try to bring back the students and such. There she is.
Wilson

She said she wouldn’t come if you…

S. Knight

If I weren’t there. (Laughs)

Wilson

Oh, if you weren’t there. Oh wow.

E. Knight

Was it the one you wanted to introduce?

S. Knight

Well, she wanted me to meet her whole family, but she has done great
things. I just couldn’t even realize at all that she had her own company
doing something. She was chief dietitian for the Oklahoma City schools
for a while. She has just done great things. She gave me a ride home in
her… I think there was another one too, but she was the first black
student I think we had in our college. I’m for sure in our major, anyway.

Wilson

There just weren’t very many?

S. Knight

No, this was kind of early on, and she just thought I was the greatest, and
I didn’t realize I had done anything extra special for that child.

E. Knight

Where is she in relation to the girl in Memphis? In what position is she
in relation to who you trained? You said she was the first. I thought this
other girl might have been.

S. Knight

No, Tara came after this girl. Tara came in to me as a graduate student.
Anyway, her husband is from Nigeria. That was interesting having two
as my graduate assistants.

E. Knight

Tara was a pretty girl. Her mother was a teacher. They are doing very
well, both of them. I just think that is great. (Laughs)

Wilson

What year did you retire?

E. Knight

’98 or ’99, I cannot remember.

S. Knight

I retired in December at the end of the semester. It was either ’98 and
very close to ’99 or ‘99 and very close to 2000.

E. Knight

I cannot remember either, and you went on to become a judge. She was
traffic judge.

29

S. Knight

Oh, yeah. I was traffic judge for a while.

Wilson

Really?

S. Knight

Yes.

Wilson

In Stillwater?

S. Knight

Yes. At the University. I don’t think they particularly liked me as traffic
judge.

E. Knight

The students liked you.

S. Knight

Well, we would go out. I would have Earl drive me around and we
would look at the different places and if they said—one person said, “I
got this ticket for not being in the right parking place.” He said, “You
couldn’t see the markings because they were covered in mud.” It had
rained. So I went out and looked, and it had covered all the markings. It
would really get them because I forgave a lot of them, but I hung in
really tight, too, with a bunch that didn’t. We would just go out and look.

E. Knight

It was too late, because you were being fair. Otherwise, if a student got a
ticket, he was guilty. I mean, that was just the way it was.
And then try to appeal it, but very few of mine were appealed because I
had the goods on them whatever it was they were wanting to appeal. I
would tell them sure, appeal it. You can do it. There is a board of people
you can take your appeal to, but you were on the line. I went out and I
saw what the situation was. It wasn’t exactly as you described it. Very
few of them. I don’t think I ever had an appeal that was turned over.
Finally they just disbanded the appeals court.
Yeah, because for once the kids were getting a fair shake, guilty or
innocent. That was something that needed to be done. I hadn’t thought
much about it. I got a ticket or two over there. If you got a ticket you
were guilty. I just paid. That’s easiest if you were guilty or not. Then
they went out and found this ole judge, she would go out and look.
(Laughs)
He was retired you see. He is driving and I’m looking.

S. Knight
E. Knight

She’d write it down. When you got the answer from her you admitted in
front of the court. Look, I went out and saw you are guilty as sin or you
are not guilty.
What was your position when you retired? What was your title?

S. Knight

Associate professor. I needed to write more articles. That’s one thing.
You sit down and you write the stuff up, that is what gets you known in
the school. People, if your researcher is publishing the good articles it
really makes your university have a real good reputation, too. It is
important, and that is part of the extension, is getting your results
published. I guess you could say I thought of my extensions as what you
say and I didn’t get enough things published. They were publishable but
I was busy doing other things.
Well, what are some things that have kept you busy in retirement?

Wilson
S. Knight

Oh, cross word puzzles, walking the dog, the grandchildren. We now
have two great-grandchildren. Three! Three! (Laughter) So far all girls.

E. Knight

Normally we were raising grandchildren. We had somebody in the
house.

S. Knight

Yeah, Michaela when she was three years old, [her dad’s] wife just
asked him to leave. She just wasn’t ready to settle down yet. Michaela
moved in with us, she and David, when she was about three. I remember
reading in the divorce decree that he had a place to go to take her, so that
he wasn’t like these single parents that don’t have enough time with the
child, too. So anyway, so she was with us. Spent some time with her
mother but mostly…
We raised her.

E. Knight
She is how old now?
Wilson
S. Knight

E. Knight
S. Knight

Sixteen now. Now she is spending most of her time with her mother.
That was her decision. She still—like she drifted in here yesterday for
some reason or another.
I actually have power of attorney for her, but before that Amy was here
for a while, we had Mary Joe.
Yeah. (Laughs) It is my theory, empty nests is a rumor. (Laughs) Now
the kids are mostly gone but we have got their animals they left. Two
cats and two dogs.
What in your life has given you the greatest satisfaction?

Wilson
First, my marriage.
S. Knight
Hey, that’s okay. (Laughs)

E. Knight
S. Knight

All the other things pass away. (Laughs) I think through it all I really
thought I couldn’t stand to be away from school, because I really did
think that I taught my classes better than anybody else could, and I
haven’t had any urge to go back. I think it is because of the family. We
have had family around. It is here and there are things that sometimes I
couldn’t be a part of because I was teaching. I love my professional life
but I didn’t have any trouble at all giving it up, and it kind of surprised
me.
We are very lucky only one of our children, David, is in Afghanistan
now but that doesn’t count, John is up in Indianapolis and that is a long
way off and we don’t get to see as much of John, but our other children
are close. Amy is in Tulsa. She is the one that is the farthest away right
now. Up until recently Wyatt and Katie were here so now they have
scattered. As I talked to other people when they grow up the kids usually
go off. Like in your family, your mother and her sister, you are still close
enough you are all here and can be a family, and you get together pretty
often. Many other times the kids move to Alaska, they do something. So
it has been real nice having family. I haven’t ever felt bored. I kind of
feel bad that we don’t do more things but we have just been content.
We got old real quick.

E. Knight
Well, how important has OSU been to you?
Wilson
S. Knight

E. Knight

S. Knight

Very important. In the first place, it is sometimes kind of hard to get a
job where you went to school. They think of it as inbreeding but on the
other hand they were impressed with me as a student. I have really
appreciated this college and the university.
I think what impressed me as an outsider is they were, at least in her
college in her degree, they were loyal to their good students. Two of
them worked there for a while and were well received. I think that is
kind of rare.
Yeah, and I liked the philosophy about the university and about the
college and about the department. They put up with a lot from me, too.
(Laughs) Like I wasn’t publishing as much as I should, but I was doing
the things that I wanted to do and so much of the outreach with people in
the state. I think my dean appreciated that. She would go out and be
talking to somebody and I would be telling her about, “Oh, yes, we’ve
been working with Dr. this, that and the other,” and she would say,
“Could you kind of keep me posted about what it is you are doing? It’s
kind of embarrassing sometimes.” (Laughs) I didn’t do a very good job
of keeping her posted sometimes, but I like to work with the little

32

people, I guess. In extension, if your job is pure extension you are doing
a lot of that but I just love teaching, too. This way I could do it both.
Teaching, as I said, the classes that I loved. The ones I liked best as an
undergraduate were the ones I got to teach.
Have you had some family members graduate from OSU?
Wilson
S. Knight

E. Knight

Let’s see. (Laughs) John, Benita finished with that two year degree,
Amy has her degree in wildlife management. None of them chose my
field. David went to school for a while but not long. John got three
degrees from OSU.
Jeremy finished over there. Jesse finished over there, or I think he is
going to. He is just a casual student but I think he is going to make it.
Mike, of course, finished and worked for them for years. Mary Jo
finished over there.
Yes, and has been teaching. Mary has been teaching in art. Katie.

S. Knight
Now Wyatt and Dustin.
E. Knight
Claim another one.
S. Knight
We’re pretty much an OSU bunch. (Laughter)
E. Knight
Wilson

Sounds like you have some great-grandkids that are going to be ready in
the next fifteen years.
And Steven has swore that is where he is going

E. Knight
S. Knight

And Amy’s son is a senior at Broken Arrow. I think he is going to Tulsa
for his first two years because it is free. He is already working with
advisors so that whatever he does over there at Tulsa will be transferred.
Awesome.

Wilson
E. Knight

He gets good grades, so he will. We have tried to set up an account to
help him, too. We hope to get all our grandchildren to OSU.
Or the great-grandchildren. (Laughs)

S. Knight
That will be up for the next generation.
E. Knight
Wilson

Well when history is written about you, what would you like for it to
say?

33

S. Knight

I guess, well, I think that all of my students really felt that I was fair and
did a good job, and if they needed something extra special, they got it.
Now about the rest of my life, I don’t know. (Laughs) I would like to not
do as much as we did. I liked my involvement with church work and
particularly with international students with the university that we would
teach English to. I like serving on the University Center Foundation at
church because I think of my experiences of being a teacher at the
University. It helps me have a feeling for what the university students at
church do need, but I have been very unremarkable about most things. I
didn’t win any peace prizes but I think what I did, in my mind I did well.
Wonderful. Well, thank you very much for visiting with me today.
