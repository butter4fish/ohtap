Marcia Greenlee:
This is part one of an interview with Reverend Charleszetta Waddles. The date is the twenty-eighth of March, 1980. The interview is taking place at the Saint Regis Hotel in Detroit, Michigan. The interviewer is Marcia M. Greenlee.
Reverend Waddles, you are an ordained minister in the nondenominational church. You were reordained in the International Association of Universal Truth, and you are the founder and director of the Perpetual Mission for Saving Souls of All Nations, Incorporated. How did your interest in a religious ministry come about?
Well, I think that possibly I was born with a certain something that makes for a religious activity. I always gave when I was young; I always had a kind heart. And my mother used to say to me when I was very small, "I wish I had a heart like you." I had compassion, I was forgiving, but at the time I didn't call it by that name. I said, "Well, I just can't help it, I'm free-hearted," you know. And, so my mother, she would always look at me as if, well, you know, she's a strange girl. But I found out that there is no such thing as a free-hearted person. My belief is that God is spirit, no matter what we call Him; I prefer to say the power of God that works in and through people. Some people do great things and never go to church, never... They call themselves Christians. But I believe that that's that spirit of good, working through them, whether they recognize it or not. And I think this is what happened to me. I think that this spirit of good could always get through me-, I didn't have the mind to recognize it as such. Today I know that it's not me, but the good or God in me that does the work now.
Are there other aspects of your religious philosophy that you would like to explain, describe?﻿2
CW: Yes, I always explain to young people especially when they ask me how I got started, and then interviewers sometimes ask me where did I get the idea. I always tell them the Bible. But I'm an advocate that you read the "red letters"* because to be a Christian is to follow the teachings of Christ. The teachings of Christ offer a challenge. He said that, "I'm the light of the world, but after I'm gone you're the lights of the world. These things I do, ye should do and even greater things." He tells you to forgive seventy times seventy, He tells you to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, take poor people[from] outdoors, and inasmuch as you do for the least of people, you've done unto Him. To me that offers a real challenge, that if Christianity is to be a viable, active, demonstrative thing, then we must do these things. That's what I believe. Everybody has their own belief, but I just don't think that sermons are enough. I think that we should be doers of the Word as well as hearers.
MG: So you're not so much concerned with theoretical aspects of Christian
theology as you are with practical applications of Christian principles. Would that be a true...
CW: That would be true. I believe that today offers a challenge for
Christians to create as well as motivate people today. I don't believe it's enough for us to abide by the rituals that someone set; God didn't set them, it was man that did that. Someone put a ritual for us to go by a certain hour, we were all the certain color that we were. I believe that in this day, that God still is giving man— and when I say man, I'm speaking of woman here too—the freedom of creativity to create what is needed for solutions to problems in this world today. I don't think that we can solve them by reading about Paul and being emotional over it and not doing anything about it. I believe that we are to seek and find, we're to knock at the consciousness of our minds and the door will be opened, and we might be able to do the things that we... Because we live in a different age, and it takes a different creative imagination to cope with what's happening today.
MG: So yours is a social gospel?
CW: I think you'd say our... It's funny you said that. I always say this is a church with a social conscience. And I believe that especially if you're in the inner city, you know, I think that you render unto Caesar that which belongs to Caesar, unto God that which belongs to God. And I believe if you are establishing a religious outlet, a direction for people in the urban areas, then you should mold your activities that they might encompass not only the spiritual but the physical needs of people.
MG: When were you ordained in the Pentecostal church?
CW: Back in 1956, early 1956.
* "Red letters" refers to the practice of printing Bibles with the words of Jesus in red ink.﻿3
MG: And is the International Association of Universal Truth Pentecostal?
CW: No. The leader is, well, I would say interdenominational leader. He has churches all over the United States. He is the pastor also of New Galilee Spiritual Church here in Detroit.
MS: What is his name?
CW: His name is Bishop M.J. Moore.
MG: And when were you reordained in that organization?
CW: Back in, I believe it was in 1961.
MS: Now, could you tell me something about the origins of the Perpetual Mission for Saving Souls of All Nations. When was it established?
CW: It was established, well, we started having meetings back in 1956.
I started having little prayer meetings at different people's homes, and in 1958 we had our first real organizational meeting. It was September 28, 1957. And that's when we established the fact that we were going to go into an organized group.
MG: Now, this was '57 or '58?
CW: '57...
MG: '57.
CW: September 28, 1957.
MS: Go ahead, I'm sorry.
CW: We also, from that day on, we began to create ways to help people. I told them then that my desire was to see a group of people, no matter if they were poor—we were all poor women with a house full of children, most of us—and I felt that you are never too poor to help someone. I suggested that we each contribute so much out of our pantries that we might have a storehouse of food; that if we couldn't give any clothes, that each one would ask their friends to ask their friends that we might establish a clothes closet, as well as any other things that we can help someone with.
MG: You were all women?
CW: At that time we were all women.
MS: And then as a group, you determined how to distribute whatever you were able to collect?
CW: Yeah, you know, a funny thing about it, one of our women members of that group was the first person to come to us for help. She was a woman with thirteen children and her husband was ill at the time,﻿4
CW: (cont.) and she was behind in her house payments. I think she owed around four hundred and some dollars then, and she came to us with her problem. I, after praying, asked God to show me a way how we could help her. We didn't have any money, so I suggested that we all solicit for food, and that she'd be able to use her money she'd ordinarily buy food with to pay on her house. So I told her to save her food money and we would buy food for her, and we managed to do it.
MS: How did the group evolve, and the mission come about, from this stage?
CW: Well, from that stage, we kept having these prayer meetings. One
afternoon, I was sitting at home and I had the inclination to look in the For Rent signs in the daily newspaper and I looked in there and there was an ad in the paper that said, "Store for Rent. Two month's rent free." I said, "Oh gosh, this is it." And I went down to talk to this man about it, and he said to me that they surely were going to give two month's rent, but you had to pay two months to get two months, and that way, you would be four months. But I told him that I had read and misunderstood it, that I had an idea that I wanted a prayer mission, that we had this prayer band. And well, it ended up that he let me have the two month's rent free first [laughter], and that's how I started.
MG: How did it come to be that out of this group of women you began to really take the lead and the major part of the initiative and the growth of the group?
CW: Well, I was the one that thought up the idea of having a prayer band anyway, and I had a vision to take Matthew 25: 31-46 [which] I quoted a few minutes ago, "When I was hungry, you fed me; when I was naked, you clothed me," et cetera, and used that as our, should I say, goal, to do some of the things that we felt was needed in our community. And I guess there never was any question as to who was going to lead it, you know. I've still got some of the folks with me that were there then.
MG: I was going to ask you that. How did you determine who would be the recipients among the people who needed your services? How did you identify them, and then how did you determine to help them?
CW: Well, you know, I always take the Bible as my guideline, and the
red letters specifically, because those are the words of Jesus. So I made a policy that we didn't try to determine who was worthy to receive what we had or whether they really qualified to get it, because the Scripture says you let the wheat and the chaff go together, and let God separate it. And I felt that if a person should come who really didn't need it, evidently there was something else that they needed. Maybe it's a person who has no confidence in charity per se, or they don't believe anybody's right, or don't believe anybody cares, and they come to prove that they are right. Maybe they will be touched by the fact that somebody treated them right when they needed it. Or maybe if they came for food, they might be an alcoholic and in giving them food, I might be able to﻿5
CW: (cont.) get to them at the real problem. So we made it a sort of, not a written law, but a unwritten law, that we would let our heart work with us and that we would find a way. And sometimes when people came in, and they didn't appear to really need it, but they were just playing, or maybe they said, "Well, we don't have our credentials." We would say, "Well, let me tell you. You know, there is a law that we must follow, we must keep records because I don't want to go to jail. But I'm going to give you something for one day until you come back. I don't want you to say you'll be hungry tonight. So I'll give you enough to last you today, and then tomorrow, you can come back and do it for the records."
MG: So, the law now that you are talking about was to maintain a nonprofit status?
CW: Yes, maintain a nonprofit status, and then maintain records so that if... Of course, I knew I had to ask people to help me, and having left school at twelve years old, I didn't even know all the things that I know today about records. But I knew that if I recorded all that came in and all that went out...
MG: You were on safe ground.
CW: ...I was on safe ground. [laughter]
MG: Can you tell me the names of some of those women from that original prayer group that are still with you?
CW: Yes, one of them worked very closely with me, and her name was Alma
Ruff. Another one is Ollice Collins, who doesn't...she's kind of lost her eyesight now, so she doesn't, you know, be there too very much. One of the others who was there passed last month, it was. Leola Smith is another one. Leola doesn't come to the church now because she is, well, she is older than I am. So she visits the church that's quite close to her. And she always says that she believes that her work for—'course she was with me twenty years, she's just been gone about a year—and she says that she believes that she was sent there to try to teach them folks how to be missionaries, [laughter]
MG: How and why was the particular name selected for the mission chosen?
CW: It was suggested by someone. I wanted it to be known that we were
concerned religiously about the soul. And also that it was for anybody, you know, regardless of race, creed, or color, or national origin, because when people are in trouble, they are just in trouble. And I couldn't dare sit there... And I knew that most of my help was going to come outside of my people...
MG: This is material...﻿6
CW: The material things. And so consequently, I had to let them know that I was there to help them too if they were in trouble.
MG: In terms of the total numbers of people that you assist, are they
predominantly black, or are they fairly balanced between other racial groups, or what?
CW: No, I would say, I would say seventy-five, twenty-five. Seventy-five percent black.
MG: Your mission has offered a variety of public services including a
restaurant that offered food either at very low cost or at no charge, a clinic, tutoring, legal services, job training in quite a variety of areas, as well as job placement, and on occasion, emergency shelter. Do you offer all these services still?
CW: I have everything but the clinic. We do not have a clinic, but we
are in the process of reactivating our building operation, and hopefully, when we do, we will have a clinic, not the same kind that I had. I want to go into a well-baby clinic, and I'd like to have free medical services a couple of days a week. You see, the needs change from time to time... Since we are an emergency services program, I like to keep abreast of what the needs are. The need for a thirty-five-cent kitchen is not as needed as it was when I opened it back in 1959. If I had one in the Cass Corridor area, then that would be fine, but it is hard to find a place in that area that's large enough to accommodate the need. A thirty-five-cent restaurant has to be large enough to accommodate a lot of people, and it also has to be in a special kind of area because people just absolutely can't walk too far, especially seniors. And today you take into consideration a lot of things; people are getting food from social services or they get food stamps, you know, so their need is not great. And I don't feel that I should, just to keep the name, keep a service going that is not needed as much. Now about our clinic, now you find that there is many, many clinics that are open, but there's not many well-baby clinics. And there's not hardly any free medical services at all. So we hope to go into free medical services for people who don't have a Medicaid or Medicare card, people who... And you can get some doctors who will give their time to see that this is done. And then you get pharmaceutical companies to supply some free medicines, you know. Or the doctors who are in the offices when the salesman comes by and leaves them their samples, and they can see that we have the medication there for these doctors to use. So this is in the planning stages now, because it would do much more than staying into that same thing.
MG: Are there other services that you offer that I didn't mention?
CW: Well, we do have housing, you know. We have the nonprofit housing division. The office is at Sixth and Howard in the state office building, and our attorney is the director of it. It's called Mother Waddles Nonprofit Housing.
MG: Is it a placement service?﻿7
CW: No, this has to do with low-cost housing, HUD houses, the redone
HUD houses, etcetera. Now in our services at the mission, we have a home placement, like people register with us their home that we might find people looking for houses. People register jobs with us that we might be able to find persons seeking work. Some of them leave their applications there, then when people come in looking for jobs, we can have them fill out a page and send them directly onto the job. What we do is just about anything a person needs. Two weeks ago I had a woman call me who had some money, but she was in a wheelchair, and nobody had visited her for two or three days and she was hungry. But she just needed somebody to come and go to the store for her. So I sent one of the people there, who went to the store for her to purchase what she wanted. So what we find ourselves doing is whatever needs to be done for a person with an emergency.
MG: Do you have your radio program on WCHD-FM still?
CW: I have one on WCHB-AM, and that's done twice a month.
MG: What is the format of that program?
CW: It's still called"Radio Help" I bring to the people news and views
of what's happening, especially in community services. Sunday before last, no, this past Sunday, I had a group from a school who work with children who are slow or children who are behind, and they were getting ready to have a pageant to raise funds to send these kids on some kind of trip, so I brought them on. The week before I had one of our missionaries on who was telling about how she had been on drugs before she got cleaned up, and how we found her in prison, and brought her in and helped her. We do that, too—we've also had a prison and jail ministry. I don't know whether you mentioned that.
MG: No, I didn't.
CW: We do have a prison and jail ministry.
MG: That involves various of your members going to the locations and offering services?
CW: And I usually take our choir and our soloist and I'll conduct the services. We also send clothing out to senior citizen homes where people are in these homes and they don't have anybody visit them, they don't have clothes. I have a lady missionary who doesn't do anything but that, and I supply her with clothes to take there. One of our missionaries at the mission, Joy Scott, is in charge of our senior citizens division, and so we are getting together a clothing wagon to take to each one of these places so people will be able to pick and choose some of the things that they need.
MG: Now, how are the various mission services provided? Who provides them?
CW: People, people. You know, after twenty-three years, people know
you're there so they'll call and say, "Do you still take clothes?"﻿8
CW: (cont.) "Do you still take furniture?" And that's how I get it.
MG: So they volunteer.
CW: It's all volunteer.
MG: And it's funded the same way, is that right?
CW: We're funded, we're not funded by any city, county, state, you know.
We don't have any dues or any taxation. We take a free will offering on Sunday and some of our members, the younger ones, believe in tithing, so they tithe. And then occasionally I write a book, a cookbook or something, to raise funds, or someone gives us an idea and we have a fund raising. That's the way we've been able to do it all these years.
MG: Over the years, you've received private funds from Ford, Parke-Davis, and materials from persons like Governor Milliken who sent you a side of beef one time. And apart from these recognizable prestigious names, you've received individual contributions of almost anything.
CW: Even a casket.
MG: Is that right?
CW: Yes, I got seven caskets one time. And you know the funny thing about it, there was a young couple who had a funeral business across the street from 2903 East Grand Boulevard, and her husband passed, and I gave them the caskets that they might be redone for her showroom. I've had caskets, I've had graves, I had a limb, you know, a leg. And there's always a need, believe me.
MG: What is the mission's relationship with Detroit's other social welfare agencies, and how is it different from the others?
CW: Well, the thing that makes it different is that it's flexible enough to help anyone. You know, most of the agencies are proportioned off. You have an old age group, you have a youth group, and you have a senior group, so you can't walk into the senior building if you are a young person, or you cannot talk to anyone in the blind group if you are...
MG: ...sighted. [laughter]
CW: So, our purpose is to have the kind of place that you can come to
under any conditions. We are more like the liaison, the mouthpiece for people who don't know. People who come in and maybe they can't talk to the worker, we talk to them for them. Maybe they don't even know how to explain to the utility company how they can afford to make a payment. So we make arrangements for them. Maybe they don't have but two days in between their check, or somebody stole their check and they got to wait five days before they can get a replacement, so we're there and give them food for the five days.﻿9
MG: These are welfare checks, or social security checks?
CW: Checks. And many times they have all kind of problems with them, people steal them in the mailbox, or they get lost in the mail, or they are behind two or three days. And people who are on limited income or fixed income, they just can't hardly go too long past their check due date.
MG: Can't afford that.
CW: They can't afford to go those days. So there must be someone there. And many times there are women who come in and just need one pair of shoes for one little girl. The other day, there was one there who just needed some shoes for her little girl so she could go to school. Or a kid will come to me and say, "Mother Waddles, I'm going to the Job Corps. I need some clothes." So we outfit him and let him go to the Job Corps. You know, all kinds of things. We bury people. I had a bridal salon here who gave me some gowns. There was a woman who lived right across the street from where I live, where you picked me up this morning, and she was an alcoholic. She was the alcoholic of the block. But she had a fine young son who... seventeen years old, ready to go in college, and she died. And there was no insurance. And he just couldn't think of her being in a "pauper's funeral," so he called it. He had a stepfather who was also an alcoholic. So we placed him in a family care situation. Well, he's still there doing fantastic. I had had a group that gave me $4,000 as a present at a funeral home, and I spent $1,700 dollars on her, and I used one of the bridal gowns to dress her up and she had a marvelous funeral. And her son now is at college doing fantastic. So we do all kinds, all kinds of. ..
MG: A tremendous range of things you...
CW: Yes, I had one woman, there was a fire, and two of her children got burned up, and she was in the hospital. So the other portion of that money went to bury those other children that got burned up, you know. So it's problems. You can just take it everywhere, and we're there. One woman came in and she had been to one of the government classes to prepare... You know, thev take the agency women recipients and prepare them to go in better jobs. And she had gotten hired at Ford, but she wore size 22%; she didn't have no bra, she didn't have no girdle, and she didn't want to go to work because, you know, she just didn't look right. So we gave her the monev to buv a airdle and a bra. It's better to eive her the money to buy a girdle and bra, and have her go on with a clear frame of mind and go to work.
MG: Now many of these people whose cases you are describing that you've
helped and the rest would presumably be eligible for city-funded programs. What happens?
CW: Many are eligible for city-funded programs, but they don't buy a bra﻿10
CW: (cont.) and girdle. And I don't know whether they're doing it now, but I've had to buy support hose for people because they have no money in there for those support hose—five, six, seven, eight, nine dollars for a pair of stockings, it's not there. Or your daughter who wants to play tennis, or your child who wants to roller-skate. Many a time a mother has come to me and asked me for some skates that have come from the suburban house, for her daughter. Or a young woman who came to me last year, her daughter had tried to go to nursing school. So we furnished all her nursing uniforms. She couldn't afford them. Nursing uniforms are high. And if you're finding your way into a situation, and you're on welfare, boy, somebody best help them. So we gave her all her uniforms she could wear to school.
MG: So would you say that city- or government-funded programs are too
limited, perhaps, in their focus as well as in their funding to really meet the total range of human needs?
CW: Oh, yes. Especially if you want people to progress. If you just want to keep them alive, so to speak, well, this is fine. But if you want people to come up out of the ghetto, if you want people to reach out and be somebody, then there is more that has to be done, you know. The little girl who's going to school who can't get her hair done, you know. The prom dress, the girl whose mother's on welfare and the prom is at hand. There's no money there for pictures. We bought pictures. There's no money there for the prom dress. We furnish the prom dress. You understand what I'm saying? Arid don't you know that it makes all the difference in what happens to that girl at the prom dance? Really.
MG: Completely different self-image, yes.
CW: Completely different.
MG: Now, I've understood from reading some of the material that has been
published about you and your work, that you receive frequent referrals from the city's hotline, and when the U.S. Senate Committee on Hunger had an inquiry regarding emergency services in Detroit, they found that the most dire cases were sent to Reverend Waddles. So you fulfill an unquestioned and prominent place in the city's social welfare scheme of things, and yet there's no contribution from these agencies towards furthering your work. Does that seem equitable to you somehow? Do you think there should be some other arrangement?
CW: Well, I think there should be, but when you're talking about Caesar and you're talking about God, I equate them with Caesar. [laughs] I equate them with not-spiritual things. And my Bible tells me that the letter killeth what the spirit will keep alive. I find that they do have the letter, but the spirit isn't there. And so if I continue to want to hold onto the spirit, then they say, "What it is, you're paying the cost that we have lost," you know.
MG: Reverend Waddles, about how many people would you estimate receive the mission's services per year?﻿11
CW: Well, you know, I would have to go back, and we have a file for
each year. The line got to ninety thousand, and I quit counting. I felt like that possibly I might get to ego tripping. You know, numbers can... [laughs] It shocked me, really. Ninety thousand people. When I got to ninety thousand people, I just quit counting.
MG: You've told us already several of the types of services that you've offered, and the tremendous range that they cover, but I'd like to ask you again here to relate what you consider, in looking back over these many years of service, to have been some of your most interesting cases.
CW: Well, I've got one case that I think was interesting. I had a young man who died last week. But he came to me, he didn't have any place to stay. But he came to me as a woman, he came dressed in women's clothes and looking exactly like a woman, and he had to sit and tell me that he really was a man. And he called and there was no place for him to stay, and somebody asked him to call me, and I sent one of my workers out to pick him up because he didn't have carfare. After I got him there, I found out then that he wasn't a woman. But after... I got him involved in mission work as a woman, after having found a place for him to stay. He had this beautiful voice, very talented person, and I began to talk to him about changing. And he was going to Harper Hospital for sex change—the records are on file at Harper Hospital—he was going there preparatory to getting the hormone shots to really do the final work to become a woman. And I found out he had a wife and four children. I began to talk to him and work with him, until I finally got him to one day say to me that, "I believe I'll go away and I'll come back, because I believe I will go back with my family." And I said, "You don't have to go away. Everybody here knows what you are. Only thing I say is, just go home and change clothes and come back." And I put him back in the choir the next day. I said, "Now, there's no more Ann now, and this is Jerry. And I want you to respect him, and be grateful that he has the courage and challenge." I brought his family here, his wife and four children. They lived with me until they could find a house. They found beautiful happiness in the last four years. But he passed. They had his funeral last week. But I think that was one of the greatest things God has blessed me to do, was to get him. And I have a white one—he was a black one—I have a white man that came to me as a woman, that I got back into men's clothes.
MG: Do you have any understanding of what brought about this change initially from...
CW: I really think it's a wanting to be loved in a special way. I think
they had a feeling that being a woman would bring them more happiness, less responsibilities. And this young man, he was brought up in a home where the mother just smothered him as a baby. When the father died, she relied solely on him. He was the cook, he cleaned up the house, he did the housekeeping. He was like a girl in the house. And he married this little girl; they were little boy-girl sweethearts. But there was this leaning toward being something else that always﻿12
CW: (cont.) stayed in him. I don't understand it totally myself, but I
have a way of telling them that they are made in the image and likeness of God, and however God put them, that's how they should stay. And if they tried to go beyond what God had made them, then they were only asking for problems themselves, and I equate all their problems, you know. He had a boyfriend who would whip him, and I said to him, "But you asked to be a lady, and ladies get whipped." And somehow I was able to mold him. He went into the ministry. He, oh, I just wish... I hope he has written a story. He was writing on it. I hope he finished it. I don't know. I'm gonna ask his wife because she accepted him back. She knew what he'd been. His children knew. I think that's one of the greatest things that God had blessed me to do, because I feel that many of us make a mistake when we say, "Okay, let's accept homosexuality, and let's put up with it, and let's forget it." Well I say, let's accept it to a point. But if there's any way that we can get them to go back to their consciousness and become what God would have them to be, let's do it, you know. And I've been blessed. I've turned ladies around, stopped them from being men, and I think that's some of the work that I do that I am totally, totally happy about.
MG: Have there been other cases that, you know, in your memory, really stand out as special ones?
CW: Oh, yes. I have another case that, there was a white girl who came
to me one Monday morning. I remember coming into the restaurant, and I'd seen her sitting over at a table, but I just assumed that she was one of the customers. When she kept sitting, I asked one of the workers why was she waiting so long. And he said, "She wanted to see you." So when she came in, I found out that she was carrying a baby that was dead, that her and her husband were separated, and she was living in at the emergency shelter, Detroit Emergency Shelter. And the lady down there, Mrs. Latouth, had brought her to the hospital and dropped her off. But preceding that, the day before, she went to several churches for prayer. She didn't want to go and get this baby taken without prayer. She had found an excuse at each one of these churches to see the pastor—tomorrow, they're busy, see the priest tomorrow, but you know, he can't get to you today. And she just wanted to tell them she wanted prayer. So she came to me to pray with her before she went back. So I talked to her, and then I kept telling her that she had to go back. I went down to the hospital with her, registered in as her next of kin and, you know, that was a sight. She was blonde, and here I was looking like this. I sent my son out to get her a housecoat and some slippers, and what-have-you, and got her all settled in. And then after she, they had taken this baby, and she got herself all together, and she went back to Tennessee. That one always... That always stands out for me.
I don't know whether I've sent you a copy of a letter I've got from a little girl. She was another Caucasian girl who was walking with a plastic bag, and it was breaking and full of clothes. Sixteen years old, hitchhiking and nowhere to go. And everywhere she'd stop, they'd say, "Go to Mother Waddles." And she finally got to me, and when she got there, we fed her and got her all straightened out. I found out that her people were in Ann Arbor, and we got in contact with them. And got travel passes at Traveler's Aid, and finally through﻿13
CW: (cont.) working with her and keeping her until I could get her down
to Traveler's Aid—and we'd taken her ourselves so she wouldn't get in any more trouble. And I have a letter where she's back in school, you know. All kinds of things.
One lady I've taken all the way to California because she was ill. She was here in the city, she was all swelled up, she didn't have nobody to attend to her, and she... When I walked in, I could smell the fluid. I asked my doctor if he would give her some water pills to help get some of the fluid down. He came to visit her and gave her some water pills, said, "I can get the fluid down," and one of our missionaries who'd never been to California paid our fare so she could go, and I'd take her back to California for treatment.
MG: Now you see poverty every day. What would you say are the causes of poverty?
CW: Lack of understanding in most cases.
MG: On the individual's part? Or on society's?
CW: I think on the individual's and on society's as well, because you know, I don't know whether I am an authority, but especially among poor people, I'm so very sure that they're not aware that, as a person's thinking in his heart, so is he. And when people who are poverty stricken, they don't allow themselves to even think of anything beyond that. They won't even go window shopping, because they don't have any money. And I believe that you cannot go any further than you can think. I certainly believe if you don't desire a thing, you'll never get it. And so they have no goals, they set no kind of criteria for reaching out. And I blame the church for that. The church, the inner-city church. I think the inner-city church should be the motivator. They have control of more people than any other person, people who listen to them. And I think that somehow they need to understand that history is not enough to motivate a people to reach out. I think they should take that Scripture and teach it as I've learned it. That as a man is thinking means as a person's thinking. Thou shalt decree a thing and it shall be established, it means iust that. Not lust words ever written, but words that can empower. This was said in the Old Testament, as well as the New. Thou shalt decree a thing, it shall be established. So if you decree it in the morning, people start looking for a Christmas basket in September, October, you gonna have Christmas baskets, they've already decided they are not gonna have anything for Christmas. So it's nothing for than. And there's no reason why they should do that. But somebody has to go in there with a psychological approach, either through the church, through the schools, to teach people to think.
MG: Are you saying then that if people who are poor had a change in their thinking, in their individual motivation, that that would eliminate poverty?
CW: Sure.﻿14
MG: That the source of correction is within each individual?
CW: Right.
MG: So then, by that token, we can say that people are poor because of something within themselves?
CW: Something within themselves. And they've accepted what they see outside of themselves as being true to them. I was teaching for people three years ago, four years ago, to create something for yourself. Many of you who, working for Ford's, you don't know, it might be Ford's time out. Who knows? I was saying this before they even had trouble. I don't believe that we should tie our minds up into anything to the point that we depend on it totally, other than the fact that you turn to God who is Spirit, who can give you ideas and thoughts that will transcend anything that you've ever accomplished. I believe that.
MG: You don't see any larger social issues that are causes of poverty?
CW: No. There are some, but they would mean nothing if you could fend for yourself.
MG: What are your current projects now at the mission?
CW: Well, I'm just finishing a book called Self-Awareness According to the Scriptures. But I'm not telling you anything that I believe in and not talking about, and thinking about trying to get it out of myself, you know, because I feel that if I've got the thought there, then that's my job, you know. And I'm not totally thinking about it in terms of money, okay. In terms of material possessions, thinking. But I'm thinking in terms of [what is] internal for you. Loving especially. Loving people is the greatest thing that you can do on this earth. Because after praying, nobody can be prayerfully successful without loving people. Because all that you pray for is tied into someone. We say, "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof" and it is. But it's entrusted in the care of someone. Your job, your clothes, your presence, your good deeds are entrusted in the care of someone. So when we allow ourselves not to be universal minded enough to love folks just as they are, just as they come, you know...
I had an interview yesterday about the mental health program that I am setting up. And the interviewer said to me, "We want to ask you one little thing." And I said, "What is that?" "How do you and the Reverend Staples get along?" And I said, "Oh, fantastic." Reverend Staples happens to be on their board, their treasurer, and he happened to be my ex-son-in-law. And he's Caucasian. So they wanted to know what was the relationship. But had I not had a philosophy of loving people and getting along with people, "in spite of," and "but because of," possibly I couldn't have said, "Fantastic." You understand what I'm saying? And no matter what you do, what level of work you're on, you're tied there with people. You know, "She tried to be nice to me﻿15
CW: (cont.) but I don't like her." Well, you're just hurting yourself. We thank God, we do, forever. But we forget to thank the channels that He used, you know, the channels that He used to do this you thanking Him for. They're important too. And to me, it might be simple psychology, but I think it's very important.
MG: Now, you mentioned your mental health project that you're planning.
Are there some others that you have in mind that you'd like to — and the well-baby clinic. Are there some other things in mind that you have for the future?
CW: Oh, yes. Well, I'm hoping that, especially very soon, I'm hoping
that we can get into manufacturing, to get into the creativity of...no more than creating your own, you know, your own doll.
MG: Is that one of the things you'd like to see manufactured?
CW: Oh, yeah. And I've got a barbecue sauce I'd like to go on the market for creation. I believe also that we have to, somebody has to show that it can be done. That you don't have to be a millionaire to become a millionaire. And then when they said, "The poor you'll have them with you always," doesn't mean the same person has to stay poor.
MG: Spread it around... [laughter] Reverend Waddles, have you tried
to measure your career against some standard of achievement and, if so, what standard, and why?
CW: I haven't tried, I haven't tried. I think I'm one of those kind of folk who, I'm always surprised that folks think that I've really accomplished, because I'm always reaching out to do more, and it seems to me that I'll always be reaching to accomplish. And so I just haven't even... I just do what I can.
MG: What would you say is the purpose of work—not your work specifically, but work in general?
CW: I'm not understanding you.
MG: Why should people work, and what should they get from it?
CW: Well, a servant according to the Scriptures, is one that is hired, and that was a portion of our Scripture. You work, and you get paid for it. And no matter what work it happens to be. I think that that's a part of giving and receiving. You give a good day's work, you're supposed to get good pay for it. I think that's the purpose. No other way.
MG: What would you estimate the overall impact of your mission has been?
CW: Well, when I go look at social services, and I see the drastic change that it has made, I like to believe that I have a little bit of influence. I remember one time—and I won't tell what mayor it was, but it wasn't this present mayor—I wrote out a proposal what I'd like﻿16
CW: (cont.) to see done for poor people and I gave it to this mayor's assistant. They rejected it, but that same work appeared in the program. But I look at it as this, I couldn't ever have done with it or reached near as many people. So if the idea was taken and maybe it was accomplished, you know, fine. I remember when I started out giving train fare, bus fare to people on welfare, to go bury their parents if their parents died. Before I initiated that program, well, it was just too bad if they couldn't borrow the money. They just had to stay here if they was on welfare. And finally I looked up one day, and there was some officials who came to see me, said they would like to get involved in that program. And I know I initiated that one, and they gave me credit for it. But there were many that I came up with. So I feel good inside about it.
MG: Reverend Waddles, I'd like to move now to some discussion of your
family background. You were born in Saint Louis, Missouri, in 1912. What was the month and the day, I should say?
CW: October 7.
MG: October 7. And you were the eldest of seven children born to Henry
Campbell and Ella Brown Campbell. What did you know of your father's background? Where was he born and when?
CW: My father was born in Birmingham, Alabama, but that's just about as
much... I don't really know about him other than the fact that he came to Saint Louis and married my mother. My mother did have some very short communications with his people, but not enough. There wasn't any of them even there when we had...at his funeral.
MG: How old was your father when he died?
CW: I believe he was forty-nine. He was nineteen years older than my mother.
MG: And your father was a barber. What can you tell me that you recall regarding his business?
CW: Well, when I was a little girl, real little girl, he had a barber shop, and it was all white trade. The first little girl that I can remember ever playing with was one of the little white girls who, one of his customer's children. She used to come—I can remember her calling me, "Little girl," and calling, "do you want to come out and play?" while her dad was getting a haircut. But he had a very lucrative business when we were small. I remember when I was eight years old, he brought me a diamond lavaliere with eight pearls on it for my birthday. And we lived real good up until he had a catastrophe, I'd call it, because you see barbers in that time, they just had talent, I guess, to do it. They didn't go to school to learn about impetigo, and bone structure, and all that kind of thing. And there was an itch that somebody brought in, and it just ruined his trade. And I guess it just went, you know. I don't know the total details, but I do know that because of this itch, he lost his trade.﻿17
MG: Some kind of skin infection that was passed from customer to customer?
CW: Customer to customer, yeah. And then he moved up on Market Street. That's another portion of the city. But it was all-black trade up there, and he moved there, and worked there in someone else's barber shop. But our living changed completely.
MG: I want to touch on that a little bit later. It was	not unusual for
black barbers to have all white trade, but it might	seem strange to
some of the people who are studying this material.	Could you explain something about why that was?
CW: I don't really know.
MG: Well, my understanding is that many times black barbers had a choice.
They could have either white trade or they could have black trade, but they couldn't have it mixed because white patrons would usually refuse to patronize a barber where there was a mixed gathering in his shop. And so it was simply a matter of deciding which you could do, and since white trade more often than not was a sounder economic proposition...
CW: I'm sure that's a good reason, [laughter]
MG: ...a lot of black barbers who went that route, sometimes they had two
shops, in fact, and split their time. Could you describe your father's personality, what you remember of him, and what was your relationship with him like?
CW: Well, I was the oldest child, and I was a daughter. I was the apple of his eye. I got older, I sort of didn't like it too well, the differences that he made, you know. But he was, I would say, about five-foot-eleven, about two hundred fifty pounds, thereabouts. You know, he was stout. He was a good-looking, dark brown-skinned man, heavy moustache. And of course, he dressed every day with a tie, aid was very proud. He had small hands, and I understand from my mother that he compared all the children's hands... [laughter]
MG: Wanted to make sure...
CW: To make sure...
MG: ...they weren't too big. [laughter] Now, your mother was born in Saint Louis, and her parents were Simon and Lina Brown, is that how you pronouce it?
CW: Lina Brown.
MG: What year was your mother born?
CW: I don't know. Let me see, she was nineteen when I was born.
MG: Okay, we'll figure it out from that. [1893] What are your memories of your maternal grandparents? Did you know them?﻿18
CW: Yeah, I remember living, going on weekends to their house and my mother said I was around three or four years old. My grandparents, my grandfather was a Blackfoot Indian, and my grandmother was part French. My great-grandmother even lived until I was thirteen years old.
MG: Did you know her, too, then?
CW: Yeah.
MG: What was her name?
CW: Her name was Melinda De Clue.
MG: How do you spell that last name?
CW: Capital D-e, capital C-l-u-e.
MG: This was your...
CW: ...great-grandmother, maternal great-grandmother. Yeah, she came to
Saint Louis, and during slavery, she was sold. They had a slave block down on Sixth Street. They showed me where it used to be, and that's where they sold her family. She and one of her sisters were with some people there in Saint Louis you know, so they've been there since slave time. My grandmother was born in Saint Louis, my mother was born in Saint Louis, I was born in Saint Louis. It all dated back to slavery But my grandmother that I was talking about, she was a very good-looking woman. My granddad owned a saloon.
MG: This was Mr. Brown?
CW: Mr. Brown, Simon Brown. He owned a saloon down on South Broadway,
Chrondolet Park. And of course, she pampered me too. I remember going there, and I liked fried ribs, you know, and she just fried me up [laughter] something to eat, you know. I remember one Sunday my dad coming to get me, and I was just holding on to this post that was in the middle of this floor. I didn't want to leave 'cause she was still frying ribs. [laughter] Funny how things will stick in your mind.
MG: Did your mother ever have any income-producing employment outside the home?
CW: No.
MS: Could you describe your mother's personality, and what was your relation ship with her like?
CW: Well, after a while, I got to be the mama, you know. My mother had had heart trouble. And in fact, she had had it even when my dad married her. She was going to a school they called normal to be a teacher, in Saint Louis. And she married my dad. He swept her off her feet, you know. I guess he was an older man, and anyway she married him. My mother was a soft, sweet, little, pretty lady. She weighed at her﻿19
CW: (cont.) heaviest a hundred and ten pounds. Usually she was ninety-four. I can remember at eleven years old putting her on my lap, rocking her. When I was eight years old, I used to... I remember, the first thing I ever cooked was spaghetti, and I carried it to the bed and let her look at it, and tell me the next step, and I'd go back and fix it and carry it back to her bed, and let her look at it. We had a great relationship. I used to do the shopping and, well, I was just her leaning post. At nine years old, I was out washing windows for Jewish people to make money to help her.
MG: Who were your brothers and sisters? You had six of them. Could you give me their names, in order of their birth if you can, and indicate which of them survived to adulthood?
CW: Well, I've got one...after me there was a brother. His name was John Henry, and I don't really know his birthdate. I only know that he lived about two or three weeks. And then the third child was my sister who lives in California, and her name is Regina Scruggs. She is three years my junior. And the rest of the children, the only one that I can remember who was born was Thelma, and she was born on Armistice Day, 1918—whatever that day was. I forgot that.
MG: November sometime.
CW: Yes, eleventh I think...
MG: 1918.
CW: The rest of them I don't remember, but none of them lived over two years old. My youngest sister lived, and she lives here. Her name is Oneida Jase. She was born in 1925, September tenth.
MG: So, Regina and Oneida and yourself were the only ones that survived.
CW: Survived, right.
MG: Were the others ill, or they just...
CW: Well, one of them had spinal meningitis. She was about two years old. The rest of them, I don't know. But they were so small and I was so young.
MG: What was your relationship like with your sisters?
CW: Well, I was the mama, even to the ones just three years under me. See, I was at work at twelve years old and, of course, she was just nine. So she was a little girl. And Oneida was born four months after my father died. So she was my baby, you know. And so we have a good relationship.
Oneida is a___both of them are members of my church, but the older one
lives in California. This one that's here, well, she respects me as her minister and her sister, which is an honor.﻿20
MG: Did you ever resent the pressures of being the responsible one, the one in charge?
CW: No, no.
MG: Did you ever feel it was a burden?
CW:
MG:
CW:
MG:
CW:
No, I guess I was just... Maybe I was born for burdens or whatever. But I never did resent it. One thing, I always worked, and after I got older, I always worked and found a way to make some money. I picked up numbers, all that kind of black thing. And God always saved me. He never let me go to jail for picking numbers. He never let me go to jail when I was trying to sell whiskey, and He never let me drink it. I guess He said, "Well, I'm gonna, in spite of yourself, I'm not gonna let you go too far." [laughs]
Now we're circling around this, and I want to discuss it in some detail, and that is the great change that took place when you were twelve years old and your father died. So what I'm really focused on now is the period up till that time. What was the atmosphere in the home in which you grew up? What do you remember most?
I remember, well, most of the time when I went to church, my father would take us. My mother not being well, she didn't go as much as my dad did. And in the later years, after he lost his money, I remember that he was a little moody. I remember one time he got a job doing construction. He'd never done any hard work in his life, and he would come home from work and he would just rub his hands, and it just almost tore him to pieces that he had to go do this construction work. And then he went back into this barber shop. Then there were those periods of arguments with he and my mother. And I always think that possibly if he had never got that poor, they may not have ever had these problems. But they did begin to have problems, and I was always heavy in my heart. I was growing up thinking that I'll never take this off of nobody. I always say that people should be very careful, in raising their children, what they present, because I know in my earlier years, I was very demanding with my first husband, and very hard to be with, because of what I'd seen happen with my mother.
Do you think that economic pressures had a lot to do with the deterioration of their relationship?
Oh I'm sure. They continued to live together, but it wasn't a pleasant thing. I remember one time my mother taking us, and we all went out to live somewhere with some friends of hers, and finally, one day, she had to send me down to my dad, my Papa we called him, to talk to him about some things, and then we went home. But I'm just sure that had there not been this lack of money that things would have been different. He would just go out on the corner and just stand out and look. And then he was a very proud man. We moved to my great-grandmother's, and I can remember my mother saying that he would walk in and out of the house and wouldn't even speak to my great-grandmother, because he resented the fact that he had to be involved with getting help.﻿21
MG: What was the daily routine in the household? Do you remember the same patterns of doing things from day to day?
CW: Just about. Same thing. I'd do the cleaning. I didn't get a chance to read or be a little girl too much. I did the washing and ironing whatever, until my father got sick. Then I had to really go to work.
MG: Did your parents convey certain expectations for you and for your sisters, and if so, what were they?
CW: Well, my mother always was the one who did the talking to us about being good children. She was always preparing us for her death. I remember at nine years old, she prepared me and told me how to take care of myself and the children. And of course, I was thirty, I think, when she finally died. But being sick, she was always concerned about leaving us.
MG: Worried about that?
CW: Yes, worrying about leaving us.
MG: With whom did your family associate with in your community? Who were your friends?
CW: Well, my dad didn't do any associating with anybody. And I don't think my mother did too much, other than with the folks who were the immediate neighbors. And then the few relatives that we had, you know, a little bit.
MG: Now your father died when you were twelve, so that was 1924. And your mother was pregnant and of course, had this heart condition. You had to leave school and had to work full time then. You worked as a maid. How do you...think back, and how do you now interpret the impact of your father's death on your life materially, spiritually, in every aspect?
CW: Well, I'm sure that had he lived, my life possibly would have been different because I was an A student. I was interested in school, I had no real need to think about quitting. I wasn't in the category of being grown, so it just changed because when he passed, and at twelve years old, I was a maid, it was fine, and I'd leave and come home. But the minute I got out of being a maid and went to a factory at thirteen, that changed the whole scene.
MG: Where was the factory? What kind of work was it?
CW: It was a rag factory, you know, rags. But I was with older people. And my little girlfriend that I had then came to ask my mother if I could go with her to her auntie's house, and when I left to go with her, she went to her boyfriend's house. And she didn't tell me she was'going to her boyfriend's house, she just told me she was going to her auntie's, and asked my mother if I could go. So I went to her boyfriend's house, and his boyfriend was there, and that was the beginning of what happened,because I was thirteen, he was twenty-three.﻿22
MG: What kind of work did you do in this factory?
CW: Sorting.
MS: And do you remember the name of it?
CW: If I could think of the name of that...only thing I know is that it was a rag factory.
MG: And where was it located? You started to say.
CW: On Twenty-second Street.
MG: In Saint Louis?
CW: Uh huh.
MG: So in a way then, all of these things in a progression came about because of, at least to some extent, the disruption of your life following your father's death. Would you say that?
CW: Yeah, I'd say that. When I went back, and this man, well, he was
really a man, but to me he looked like heaven. I had started my period when I was eleven, so I knew, you know, and I was a big girl for my age. Nobody would have thought I was thirteen, they would have thought I was eighteen. And so I'd go home and, maybe in a week or so, I told my mother that I wanted to have company. And my mother said... What could she say? That I shouldn't have? I was the breadwinner, exposed to being out there... She thought possibly, if she would let me have company, if she was doing the right thing... So I had company. And what do you have company with a twenty-three-year-old man? Okay. And then finally, he says, "We're getting married," because he was going to ask my mother if he could marry me. His people did give us money for our furniture. He was a good-working man. He just died, a few years back, and he was still on the same job he was on when I met him.
MG: This was your first husband, then. What was his name?
CW: I didn't marry him.
M3: Oh, you didn't marry him?
CW: No.
MG: Oh, I see.
CW: No, I'm just talking about my first friend.
MG: First boyfriend.
CW
I didn't marry him. I got pregnant by him. He said, "Well, we are getting married, we might as well go all the way. We are all set up.﻿23
CW: (cont.) And so, it looked logical to me. And then after a while one of my girlfriends come to me and told me he'd got married that Sunday before. And I'm left... [laughs] Yup. You know, but I look back at it now as my preparation for the work I do today. I can certainly understand the pregnant girl. I can understand the widowed woman. I can understand the separated woman. I can understand the common law woman. I can understand the happily married woman. I can understand them all, and I've been that, I've been every oneof those groups. Sometimes I go to speak to groups, Parents Without Partners, and I say, "Oh, I can well talk to you because I've been a parent without a partner." And so, I look at each one of those experiences as a blessing because I finally found a way to make it a blessing. And I think that one of the things we have to do with our life is know that each thing is a learning experience and, whether it's bad or good, always reach for something better, then you can achieve. And of course, I've taken my experiences and tried to relate to people. Even when I was on the "Phil Donahue Show," I was telling him about how I used to pick up numbers and what-havc-you, and folks said, "Weren't you ashamed?" And I said, "Oh God, no," because there are many people who are caught up in that as a way of life and feel that that's all that life has to offer. And I got mail for two years from that show from people who said, "Oh gosh, you helped me."
MS:	When were you on the show? Do you remember?
CW:	"Phil Donahue?" In '75, I believe. I believe it was '75.
MG:	So you don't speak from theory. You know what you're talking about.
CW:	Oh, yeah.
MG:	What happened to your mother after your father's death?
CW: Well, my mother, she got somewhat better, physically. Along came AD(f and she was able to get some assistance. I got married, and that allowed me to not be a worry to the extent that "she's grown now." She had a boyfriend that was not very good for her. And that was her life. She never did anything but pray.
Did she leave Saint Louis? Did she... No, not ever.
And she died when you were about thirty, you said. Yes.
Were there other relatives who were important in your life?
We didn't have too many relatives. There was my great-grandmother who was very important, but she passed by the time I was thirteen. My grandmother, I guess I was around nine when she passed. And the rest of 'em, we just didn't have any.
Aid to Families with Dependent Children﻿24
MG: How about nonrelatives? Was there anyone not related to you who was important to your life in those early times?
CW: Not say, really important. They were people that I knew. And I think
that I've got some distant cousins who we always felt we were very close to. In fact, they were here this summer. And they were just a part of the joy of my life, nothing to inspire or encourage. Because once I began to really know that I was grown, and after I was married and separated, I was in the business of living.
MG: Did you have any role models that you think back on for those early years?
CW: No, but I had some experiences that started directing me. Like when I was going to church, I was a little girl, and I've always been a ham. I was in the pageants and the plays,et cetera, as long as my dad could buy all the uniforms and all the costumes and put the big money on the table. And when he lost his money and our clothing wasn't as beautiful, we were not able to do the things, the same as folks who were. "Come here, darling." "Come here, sweetheart." And I guess I was very impressionable, and I think that motivated me more than anything I could ever have, you know. I can hear the tone of their voice, and see the looks on their face. I think that's one of the things that made me study the Bible to see how could you be a Christian and come out that way.
MG: So there was really a radical kind of change, not only in the things that you had to do as a result of your father's death, but with the loss of his business even before he died, your day-to-day reception in the community changed.
CW: Oh, it was changed, completely changed. And I guess it must have left its impression. I was speaking at a college here about a month ago in Livonia, and the person who shared the program that evening was Roy Wilkins of the NAACP. And so they were asking questions. Roy was sitting on the sideline, waiting to ask, for him to come up, and they said to me, "Mother Waddles, if you were not a missionary minister, what do you think you'd be?" And I said, "A revolutionary." [laughter] So Roy said, "Mother Waddles, you're already that." [laughs]
But that had one of the greatest impressions on me. Because I'm a firm believer in that today. I believe that if you advocate Christianity, you should play the role, you should be the part. I believe that it's much better to be a sinner, and say, "I'm a gambler, and I'm a this and I'm a that," and tell the truth about it. I believe that truth is much more than that little hidden thing that people do behind the cloak of Christianity. Because we have peers and we have people that we look up to, and I think that when people cannot be sure what you are, or if they have a feeling that you're one thing and then you let them down, I think you're really guilty of destroying minds. But I believe that, and I tell folk they can follow me day and night, it doesn't matter, because I live what I talk about. You know, I don't have to look over my shoulder and wonder what group is going to see me tomorrow, or﻿25

(cont.) what happened last year because I've told that already. You know, and because I think more people are destroyed not only by the minister or the preacher or the teacher, but even by their family who live double lives, who say one thing and do another. I think it's so important.
What was the extent of your formal education?
When I got to be eleven years old, I was in the 8B. You know, they had 8A. Anyway, I don't know what that would be equivalent to today because I've helped people in the tenth grade, kids, you know, but they're school learned, you know. And when I left school, I studied the dictionary. I read an awful lot, and that's the extent of it. I haven't ever been back to school.
Have you ever wanted to resume formal study or not?
No, I haven't. I believe that I'm more useful as I am. Everybody can't be the same thing. Possibly if I had got a little bit more, I might have been into the Letter. I have to depend on the Spirit. The Spirit will teach you all things.
So, so far as formal education, it stopped at grade 8A but you continued self-education...
Oh, yes.
...and carry it through to today.
You know, ary, and I get a word relates to don't see you may no a blessing tion. But sense.
I've got a psychology dictionary, I've got a Biblical diction-do a lot of research, and study, and defining words. If I out of the Bible, then I use the dictionary to see how it the everyday world. And sometime it has worked for me. I that I would say to anybody, "Stop where I stopped," because t do anything with it. But I say, for me, I've turned it into But I say for anyone, that they should get a formal educa-I also say, don't forget your basics, and that is common
MS:	What was the church that you belonged to as a child?
CW:	A big prestigious church.
MG:	What denomination?
CW:	Afro-American.
MG:	Methodist Episcopal. Got you. A.M.E.
CW:	A.M.E. Zion.﻿26
MG: A.M.E. Zion. And to what extent did you feel then that religion was important in your life?
CW: Well, I didn't feel it too much. I knew that you should go to church.
I took it for granted my daddy wanted me to go. And like most children, I got dissatisfied with the church. I wanted to go to the Baptist church near me. So when they got to sending me a little bit by myself, I would slip in to the other church. [laughs] Well, I...but that was to the extent of it. I didn't think that it was doing anything for me or taking anything away from me.
MG: It was just a part of your life.
CW: It was just a part of my life.
MG: To what extent were you aware of local, national, international political events as a young woman? Do you remember any occurrence that had a special impact on you that was outside the experience of your community and your family?
CW: I really didn't pay too much attention even to when the 1929... thirties, when people were in soup lines, because I was blessed at the time to not be a part of that. But I began to watch the presidential elections and controversies along about that time, even when I was young. But I never became too invloved. And in fact, today, I don't, I like to know, you know. We've got people trained for census worker commission. Up until recently I had a voters' registration, I had some of my people certified to sign people up to register to vote. I believe that you have to be involved and that I should stay abreast. But I don't like to be totally involved because, when you get too involved, they want commitments from people like me, which I refuse to give.
MG: So you are able to maintain more independence by not aligning yourself.
CW: Yes.
MG: But have there been any occurrences of political nature that have shaped your thinking in some way, that have had an impact on the kinds of programs or activities that you want to be involved in?
CW: Well, yes. And there have been some...there have also been a kind of activity that I don't want to be involved in. I remember back in—I don't remember what year it was—when I was invited to the presidential inauguration...
MG: Nixon's?
CW: Yeah, but it was due to the governor, Governor Romney. I didn't know anything about Nixon, but along during that time when Governor Romney was the governor here, one of his aides came to the mission... I don't know whether his aide came on his own, or they told an aide to come see about what kind of program I was running. When the aide went back to﻿27
CW: (cont.) tell them about the program, then they sent him down there to talk to me about it and that's when the Action Program started because I began to help with some of the folks, and I gave them some of the ideas that have gone to reach delegations. If they would do the same things that I'm doing, they could reach so many people.
And I've come to realize that there must be somebody outside that political arena that's doing something. Because within that political structure, there may be human programs, but because they magnify one party or whatever, or to boost the particular political group, whatever, but the spirit of what it's all about, it's not really there. You know, and people are just numbers, and dollars, and cents. And I found out enough about it to know that I'd better stay out here, and hopefully I can encourage somebody else to be out here, outside of that particular thing. I wrote a manual, a training manual, and I've tried a couple of times—I haven't tried too hard—to get ministers to send a couple of ladies out of their church and let me have training seminars to train home missionaries. There are people who are sitting in every church who should know what's happening in the street, who could be trained to tell a woman what to do if she suspects that her child is taking pills, a woman who knows what or where to send her daughter if she's with an early pregnancy, a person who knows what to do if they are not satisfied with the verdict that the courts have given their son or daughter, if they fear that they are innocent. Many, many things that people should know.
MG: Just practical...
CW: Practical...
MG: ... advice.
CW: Advice. When people who don't know what to do...
MG: And knowledge of community services that are available.
CW: Available, yes. It would save so much, you know. And I would like to see that done. I would like to see... I don't like the thought of me being there doing it without teaching it. I'd like to be the catalyst where this could be done not only here, but anywhere in the country where people could have that feeling of wanting to do this. Some churches have got five hundred members, a thousand members, some of them are poor people. And they should be able right where they are to go into their human service office within their structure and find some answers, to fill out the census; because there are going to be many folks who aren't going to fill that census out right. They're going to write in not knowing they got to fill in dark, and then they're going to fill in, and fill in with a pen not knowing they got to use a pencil. And somebody... You know, I went to learn so that I could encourage my folk to learn, so that we can help whomever we can. But I believe that somehow if we can just only get it across to people, not to overthrow anybody, but to be an asset, to anybody.﻿28
MG: This is part two of an interview with Reverend Charleszetta
Waddles. The interview is continuing in the Saint Regis Hotel, Detroit, Michigan. The date is March 29, 1980. Interviewer is Marcia Greenlee.
Reverend Waddles, you were thirteen when you were married for the first time. What was your husband's name and could you tell me something about him?
CW: His name was Clifford Walker. He was a twin, just about identical twin. He was a young man, very charming and, you know, back then this is what young ladies looked at, charming young men. Good-looking young men. And this young man knew that I was pregnant, and he was nineteen. What I didn't know, that this young man was a man that was kept by women. He led me to believe that he was working every day, and of course to him, I was like a little toy, or a little something to sort of cherish and keep aside from reality. I was thirteen years old, very naive, very unaware of what the world was like. And he would call me every day and...from work, supposedly. And when payday come, he would bring me money home, or he'd come and stick it in my stocking. And he would take me to the movies...he would pick me up, carry me across puddles of water when it would rain, and all that kind of thing. So finally, he would bring so many beautiful clothes and he'd have so many pretty clothes that I, I was inquisitive, and I wanted to know where he'd get all his money, and he told me his auntie bought them. So one day, I asked him where his auntie lived, he gave me the address. So I decided to go surprise my husband's auntie and let her meet his wife. And when I got there, I found out there was no auntie. That he was being kept by women. And of course, they all knew that he had married a little innocent young girl and they weren't to ever say anything to me. [laughter]
And one day, I was going down Franklin Avenue. He used to stand in a poolroom, but he always told me, "Don't walk on that side of the street 'cause too many fellows out there." And so I went homeland I waved at him, you know. And I went on home, and pretty soon his twin brother came and told me that the police were looking for him. He had broke another man's jawbone who made a derogatory remark about the lady who he waved at across the street. And then he had to admit to me what kind of man he was, and how he really wanted to keep me as a wife, and he pointed out to me that he had never approached me wrong, you know. But I was indignant, and I was very upset. I thought that was the worst thing that could have ever happened to a person. So I packed my things and went home. I left him. And shortly after that, he went to the penitentiary. And while he was in the penitentiary, he got ill. He came back, it wasn't too long, and he died. By the time I was nineteen years old, he was dead.
MG: But you i)ever divorced. You were just separated?
CW: We just separated, and then he died.
MG: Did you work outside the home for any of that time?﻿29
CW: Oh, yes. I worked, I worked as a sorter in a rag factory. And then I went to a restaurant as a dishwasher, and from there I applied for a job as third cook at the YMCA, in Saint Louis. And it happened there was a woman chef there. I never can forget when I walked in that day, I was eighteen years old, and she asked me, had I ever worked in a restaurant before. I'm applying for cook now. And I said yes, but I didn't tell her I was a dishwasher not a cook, [laughter] And so, she hired me. And she told me she wanted eighteen chickens for lunch, brought me a bushel of cabbage, brought me a bushel of sweet potatoes. And you know, God has always been with me or, or some purpose. I said to her, "Well, you know, everyone doesn't do the same. Would you be kind enough to show me how you cut yours?" So she showed me how to take a knife and go down the back and down through that bone and split it in half. I didn't even know, [daughter] And how to get this bushel of potatoes together. And believe it or not, I stayed with her. One day she left and told that if the biscuits run out, to fix some. Oh, my God.' She said, "We usually use twenty-five pounds of flour." And I got palpitation of the heart as I washed those plates after I had to make those biscuits, [laughter]
MG: So you did have to make them, then?
CW: I did have to make them. I think she knew that they might run out. That's where I learned commercial cooking. Two hundred eggs at one time. We'd have basketball teams, you know. That's just like pulling concrete. You put two hundred eggs in one container, it's like pulling concrete. It was unbelievable.
MG: But that stood you in good stead then, later on with your life's work.
CW: Well, all I've ever done, even today—now that I have clothing, and I always sort the clothing before I offer them to anyone. Throw away all that's no good, and anything that's outdated, and then separate, you know. And I learned that way back then.
M3:	Did you and Mr. Walker have any children?
CW:	No.
MG:	What was your son's name that was born during that time?
CW:	Her name was Beatrice Walker.
MG:	Oh, it was a daughter.
CW:	It was a daughter. She's still alive. That's my oldest child.
MG: Would you describe your life after the time that your husband died, Mr. Walker, until you made the move to Detroit?
CW: Well, you know, I made the move to Detroit when I became twenty-four years old. But I married at twenty-one again. Between that time, I was just the normal woman who...trying to have...1 learned to do﻿30
CW: (cont.) day work. I was doing some day work that was paying good
pay. I was doing nurses' uniforms. My mother had taught me how to do white uniforms, you know, for nurses, and it paid good money at that time. And finally, I met Le Roy Wash who was sixteen years my senior. And I just had one child, and he had none. He was working as a truck driver for a coal company, and that was one of the better jobs for labor, you know, at that time. And he again, he was a six-foot-two, handsome man, older man who was intrigued with getting a young wife. And I didn't realize that he was going to get into the position of not really wanting to go to work, but rather be home with me... We didn't get any more children right away. I did some working then in fast foods—it was just beginning to come out. I started working, and I walked into this place, and I never shall forget it. Right after I married. This man said to me, "Well, don't need to tell me your past experience," he says, "because we have our own system." And I learned real fast. I ended up being the percentage person for that chain of fast food restaurants, sandwich shop. It was a spinoff from the White Castle shop, you know, that was one of the first ones.
MG: What was its name, do you remember?
CW: Liberty Sandwich. And he had three of them there in Saint Louis. So when the percentage would go down at one place, well, he'd always send me to bring the percentage up on whatever shift there would be.
MG: What was that? Just because of your sales...
CW: My sales...
MG: ... capacity?
CW: My way of getting along with people, you know. I don't know what he attributed it to, but I know it was because I could get along with folks, you know. I was pleasant, I didn't ever get into any confrontations with people. But then my husband started having trouble on his job. One day, he said to me that they were having a dispute on his job about wages, and they were going to ask for a raise. So he was elected for spokesman. And when he did go to approach the head, all the other men backed out and left him there, and he got fired.
MG: This was your boss, or your husband?
CW: No, no, my husband. He got fired. And by that time, I was twenty-four years old. So he decided, well, we would come to Detroit and look for a better job, because everybody was saying, "Go to Detroit," and this was the automobile capital, and there was always good jobs. And the lady who lived next to us had a sister who lived here and said, "Well, I'll send my sister word that you're coming, and I'm sure that she'll help you." So my husband came here. And I soon followed him. And I was out here two years before I had the second child. We'd been married five years before we had our first child, and...﻿31
MG: Excuse me, I just want to check a couple of things now. You married in 1936, was that right?
CW: No, that's '33, wasn't it?
MS: '33. Okay.
CW: Must have been '33.
MG: And so then you were there, you were married three years before you came to Detroit?
CW: Uh huh. Three years, and then it was two years before I had a second child. Because I know we were married five years before I had one.
MG: So you were twenty-one when you got married?
CW: Yes.
MG: All right, I'm sorry, go ahead.
CW: Yeah, I was twenty-one.
MG: And your husband's last name again was Walsh?
CW: Wash, W-A-S-H.
MG: So then both you and he worked for a while at Liberty Sandwich?
CW: No.
MG: Just you?
CW: He was working at the—I don't know what the name of the coal company was—but he was a truck driver for a coal company. And in the meantime, I was helping my mother because she had my younger sister, and so I would always contribute whatever I could to her. 'Cause my mother was still living. So when we came here, my husband came with the intention of getting a good job. And he got a job down on Saint Antoine and Beacon, eleven dollars a week.
MG: Was that a good salary?
CW: No, it was a horrible salary. But I tell you what it did, it gave^ me the opportunity to become an economist. [laughter] If you can't become an economist off eleven dollars a week [laughter], you can't become one.
MG: So tell me what some of your experiences were like then. You lived
in Detroit near the area they called the Black Bottom, is that right?
CW: Yeah, I lived on Hastings and Wilkins, and I lived upstairs. And
let me tell you, Hastings Street was supposed to be the bad street,﻿32
CW: (cont.) and you could leave your door open. You could go to the
store and come back, and say, well, if you stopped for a conversation, say, "I left my door open, I've got to go home." And they had all-night movies up on Hastings. You could take your child at nine o'clock at night when it was too hot and just go to the movies. I did that many a time. You pass down the street, you might find somebody playing three-card molly, but you just walk around them. Or a prostitute was in the door and, you know, you just kept walking. But you didn't have this violence, and you didn't have the apprehension about even being on the streets. It wasn't that kind of feeling.
MG: Well, tell me what life was like for you during this period, learning to be an economist?
CW: Well, you know, I'm the kind of person, I suppose, who is—is ingenious, the word I use—enough to make the most out of any kind of situation. I had a friend who was the same age as my mother. A very dignified lady, a very fashionable lady, who sort of was a second mother away from home, who said, "Now look, you don't ever, ever, ever allow yourself to worry about circumstances." I remember one day my husband had to apply for welfare, and I went to her and I had on my welfare dress. And everybody was wearing this kind of dress. Everybody had one of these dresses on that looked like chicken sacks, you know...
MG: Feed sacks.
CW: Feed sacks. And I walked in. Well, it didn't bother me. I had
nice hips and nice figure, and I was considered a fair-looking woman. So I felt I made the dress, the dress didn't make me, you know. But she in turn said to me, "Don't you ever, ever, ever walk into my home again with one of those things on. Don't ever do that. You don't have to wear anything like that. You go to the Goodwill, and you find what you need, and you stay fashionable if you are poor." From that date since, I've never had another one on. And I raised my children by going to Goodwills. And I did it so well, until the teachers would ask me where they got their clothes. But I think back at the things that she would say to me that really, really helped me. And I today say to people, "You don't have to look poor, you know, you don't have to look down. For money is a medium of exchange, and that's all; but it's not a mind regulator unless you allow it to be." And this woman, I roomed with her, my husband and I. And because of her philosophy, I was able to pick that one little tidbit up that really has kept me all the time. Because possibly being away from home with nobody to say one word, I may have got depressed in trying to raise children, because I began to have babies, and I began to have to go to the welfare. I began to not have the money. And I may have not learned that that was just an experience I was going through, but I was the controller of it, not it of me. And so my experiences were real good.
Plus, I learned to pick up numbers as a side thing, you know. I'd walk from house to house and pick up numbers. And when my children would be getting older, I learned to have that little extra quarters and dollars, and things I made for the pedal pushers and the sticks﻿33
CW: (cont.) and the things that they ask for... children usually ask for
them, to go to Jefferson Beach, and not to deprive them of the things that you can't get on welfare. And then I would go and I would do the register work at bowling alleys, I'd cook, you know, cook jobs. I remember, one time someone sent a letter to my worker; they told my worker I had an extra job. And the system does make you tell falsehoods, you know; the system causes you to be devious and conniving, to find not luxuries but necessities. It's a necessity to have school books for your children. It's a necessity that your children go to a camp. You know, that they are able to buy their school books, and there's no allotment for that. So I learned how to do that. I learned to be devious. And I remember one day someone had taken it upon themselves to call my worker to tell her that I had this job. But I had a good worker, God again looked out for me. And she called me and told me, "I'm supposed to come and visit you because I understand you got a job. So I'll be out." God has been very good to me. So I just, I learned to not only be an economist but a psychologist.
MG: How did your beginning, your first experience with welfare assistance come about?
CW: Well, the first was with my husband when we were having, I think I must have been around my fourth, fifth child. And he was being, he got laid off, and we had to apply for welfare. That was my first experience with it. And of course, it was just the bread and meat, you know. And of course, I learned. And then finally, he and I separated, and I became an ADC woman, and that's when I really learned.
MS: When did you separate?
CW: Oh, must have been forty...
MG: Before or after the war?
CW: During the war.
MG: During the war.
CW: During the war. My mother had taken ill. And they knew that this
time that she really wasn't going to do so well. And my husband had got to the place then where he really was, I should say, enjoying welfare. I mean, he wasn't looking for anything else. He was just a welfare husband. He got to the place where he'd play sick. And the reason I call it playing sick, because he'd lay around all day and then in the evening he'd say, "I believe I'll get up and go to the movies, and see if I can get my strength back." He'd go to the movies, and stay the whole show, and come back and say, "I know I shouldn't have gone." He'd feel badly. This kind of thing, and it kept on and kept on. So when my mother got so very ill, I said to the lady, I said, "I'm going to let you have this house, and the only thing I ask is that you allow my husband to stay here, that he can have one of the rooms when I'm going.﻿34
CW: (cont.) And I'm taking my children to Saint Louis to see about my
mother." I went and I got me a job. I put my children on my sister's floor on a pallet, and I got me a job. Because whenever I went back to Saint Louis on a visit, the place that I worked before I left, they'd always ask me to work. Then somebody would offer to do something, so it was no problem to go back and get a job any time I was in town.
MG: Was that at the sandwich shop?
CW: Yes. And I got my mother some furniture, and I got her an invalid
chair. As the Lord would have it, I got a boyfriend who was very much my senior, who was a mortician. He offered to marry me and put my children in a boarding home, which I wouldn't accept. I felt that I didn't want the luxury without my children. [laughter]
MS: How many children did you have at that time?
CW: I had all of them except the last two...
MG: So was that...
CW: ...the last three.
MG: ...seven, seven children?
CW: Seven children. And I stayed there. And when my mother passed, then I came back here. I came back, my husband was in the house, and he had another lady by that time. So I just wrote and told him that me and the children were coming back, and I wanted him to be out by the time I got back. And he was.
MG: So then you divorced after that time?
CW: Not exactly right away. But soon after, we divorced. And then I had one common-law husband.
MG: Husband?
CW: I had one common-law husband, and we had three children, the last
three children that I had. I was on welfare, and I had seven children. And so I just didn't really want to take the chance with him with... just a job, to take all of my children. So I just wouldn't even try to get married.
MG: Is that, would you say, a fairly common pattern where women are concerned about the loss of financial support for their children?
CW: Yes, yes, I think it is. What I did do, though, I had these children, and I didn't report them to welfare. I let him support them. And then when it came time for them to go to school, why, then he and I had just about broken up, so I was able to just put them in school without having any problems. Because he and I had broken up, and I﻿35
CW: (cont.) had married my present husband. And so I never had to put
these last ones on welfare. Each time that I made a transition, I'd always go to the welfare and tell them if I had a job, sometimes they'd give me a portion of the money, or I'd tell them that I'm working, and they could cut some of it off. And they always did, so I always had a good relationship. And I said, I guess God always made me do that, because whenever I came up with this work, and I had to do it right, that would have fazed me, you know. They knew my case history. They knew that... Well, Sturkey was my last children's name, they knew all about it, so I didn't have any problems, you know. So finally, I met my present husband, and I had nine children at home. And he married me, and that was over twenty-some years ago. And I haven't been back on welfare, I haven't had no needs to look out for myself at all since. A lot of people think that, when they read stories, and I talk about welfare, that I'm still on welfare. I haven't been on welfare for twenty-five years. And I haven't had to take a salary because I had a husband with a good job. My husband worked at Ford's and he had a good job. And today, his retirement income is around $800 a month. So that's enough for he and I. 'Course, I get $164, you know. So I can still work without salary. But a lot of people don't know that. You know, they think, well, she's out there trying to get away from it. And I haven't.
MG: What was your husband's name after Mr. Wash?
CW: Roosevelt Sturkey.
MG: Roosevelt Sturkey. Now what did that all involve... Before the time
that you married Mr. Waddles, in trying to keep your children supported, and satisfying the requirements of the federal agencies in relief, trying to keep your family together and to care for their needs, what really was life like?
CW: Well, it was a continuous doing something. I would sew at night, do my mending. I always felt like I wasn't going to have a dirty house. And I was then, I was very fastidious. I washed windows every week and curtains every weekend, and painted my house. People used to knock on my door and say, "Can I have a look into your house?" Because it was amazing to them that I could do it. I would sew at night, I would mend at night, and there was one time I had three jobs. One included picking up the numbers, and then I worked at a restaurant a friend of mine had, over the weekend, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. And then I worked at a confectionery during the day. Then I went to work in 1942, I went to work in a factory. I worked there as a punchpress operator. I was constantly trying to make it. Because I wasn't the drinking kind, I wasn't the prostitute kind of person. And so it was better always for me to have one man who I could just rely on, and we'd share whatever means were available, [than] to be out there just trying to go from one to the other, trying this one, trying that one. And it was finding ways to keep your children as one. I've never had the word half-sister5 never has half-brother, never entered into my family. They know whose father is whose father. But there's never been a half-sister or a﻿36
CW: (cont.) half-brother,never in my family. Trying to teach them to understand, to keep their dignity.
I remember one time they laugh at me bringing them some shoes with heels on and my daughter told me, "Mama, that's the one time you goofed." [laughter] But I learned how to go to the pawnshop, and when my boys began to be teenagers, especially my oldest boy, he wanted shoes. I'd say, "Get 'em at that pawnshop of mine." Want a doll's hat, I go to the hat store where somebody brought a doll's hat in and you know, left it. I learned just so many, many things. I learned to, when I cook my chicken, I smother it, I put golden egg color in my chicken, and it looks pretty. I found out you eat with your eyes first, and if food is appetizing... I would take my beans, put a little gold coloring in them, and then I'd make some gingerbread. And if I didn't make it with a little bit of lard, sometime no butter, but the smell of it and the looks of it. And when the children come in and "Oh," and I said, "But you got to eat your beans first," you know. I learned,rather than say, "Well, I don't want any damn beans, I'm sick of this old house." I didn't do that. Today, I teach not to do it. Because I learned not to do it. I didn't learn it from a spiritual standpoint, but I learned from something within me that if you paint up your bed and if you paint up your walls, and if you put a decal on something, that made all the difference in the world.
I used to put a thin line across my kitchen out of wire, and my little girls' dresses would be suspended on that line, and I'd iron them, you know, and the pleats were so pretty. And today, every one of my girls, just like the one you seen this morning, that's the way they look. They've always done that. Nobody that was mine goes out looking any kind of way. It's just that you... And I've had to take colored paper, and wet it to put color on my cheeks, crepe paper. I've had to take lard and use it on my hair, you know. And before I got to Chanel and then on to some other kind, I used Blue Waltz. I used baking soda before I could buy deodorant. But I learned that there is a way, and that if you use that way, that you can feel as good as the person who has access to more. It's all how you feel about yourself. I've taken a pencil and wet it between my teeth and shadowed my eyes, you know. Got the same look that I do today and I've got some—what is that funny stuff they got now?
MG: You mean eyeshadow?
CW: Yeah, and all this stuff, I got some fancy names. And that's what I like to convey to poor people especially...
MG: That kind of resourcefulness.
CW: Yes, that kind. And the kind that takes your old chair and covers it, that you don't just let it fall apart, just because, you know, there's something you can do with it. Learn how to sew up what you have, press it up and... I think that we've lost that somewhere along the line. We don't want to eat because we can't eat the best. Well, what is the best?﻿37
CW: (cont.) Whatever you eat, no matter who you are, what nationality, what group you are, you're going to the bathroom, you're going to eliminate, that's what it's all about, you know. If you've got satin sheets, you get flower sheets, you get cotton sheets, foam rubber, down pillows, you can't do anything but sleep. And sleep is sleep, laying on the pillow in your bed. Oh, I grant you it's nice to be in there, but it's still sleep. And if you graduate to twenty dresses, or if you're down to two, you'd better not wear but one or you gonna look silly. Twenty hats, you can't wear but one hat, you know. And when we make our priorities these things that pass away...and I know that spirit. I worked real hard for linoleum; I covered my whole house with linoleum. I bought glass tables because I prided myself that I could work and get these things in spite of... And the minute I finished laying the carpet, the house caught on fire. I didn't have any insurance. You understand what I'm saying? So you have to put your priorities straight that you might live long upon the earth with the Lord. And if you laugh, laughter is only laughter, no matter where it comes from. And when we find that out, the little boy who takes the broomstick and rides horses gets the same sensation as the. one who has the real hobby. When we learn that, then we can grow.
MG: It's a liberating sort of knowledge.
CW: Yes, and it's fantastic for me, and for some people that I've been able to inspire.
MG: Let's talk briefly about your children and then I want to ask you a
little bit about Mr. Waddles. Could you give me your children's names? We started with Beatrice, your eldest, and tell me a little about each one of them.
CW: Yeah, Beatrice is my oldest child. She was twelve years old before—
well, thirteen—before I had any more children. And again I said God did that because he gave me a baby-sitter.
MG: In Beatrice?
CW: In Beatrice. He gave me a little homemaker. Beatrice was a child that did not go beyond the third grade, and they didn't have the program that they have today. They didn't have those kind of programs for children who were slow. So I, with the love in my heart, told her she was special, and that just really didn't matter. The doctors told me I might as well take her out of school—she wasn't going to get it—by the time she was fifteen. But she worked with the children. She loved them, just loved them. So when she was fifteen, I called the electric company, and I told them that my daughter was coming out of school because of the situation at home, and I would like for them to hire her if they would. She could read and write her name, you know, do some reading but not... no extensive reading. Fair, and soft, real soft. She's always been real soft. They gave her a job running the elevator in their office building, and her whole life has been spent running elevators. One job she worked on seven years. She was only off two weeks out of seven years. Always working, always. And in our home, she was the one who﻿38
CW: (cont.) put the first television in there, when nobody else had a
television, because she could use her money for the little luxuries we wanted. We have a recording machine because she was working at Wurlitzer's, and it was just easy to get 'em and pay on 'em. We had a television in 1947 when folks wasn't having television. She always bought nice clothes, because I kept her... And she can sing. She's never been able to experience what people experience.
Her first husband was a college man who is a great golf professional. Somehow they managed not to stay together after two children, because she didn't have the wisdom to learn to play golf, and he didn't have the wisdom to not get big at it. But they're still friends today. Then the next husband she married was a musician. He knew that she liked to drink. So he almost ruined her by keeping a bar up here and keeping her at home, not wanting her to work, just stay home and fix you a cocktail and fix you this, fix you that. So that today she is single and that husband has got a woman. Well, he lives with a white woman who's had some babies for him. But Beatrice works for the mission. She operates our store.
MG: What's her married name?
CW: Beatrice Green.
MG: And she's living here in Detroit?
CW: Yes. She has two children, and two grandchildren.
MG: And who was born after Beatrice?
CW: Le Roy, Le Roy Wash, Jr. Le Roy is my resident agent. Well, he went to the Marines when he was very young, and he's married. He has a wife and two children. Along the way there are some more children. But he came from the Marines here to help me, oh, I guess about eight years ago. I was ill at the time. But he's just now settling down into really what the mission is all about. He had all the brawn, all the knowhow... talented, so many talent's. He's an artist, and he's a photographer. For the Marines, he did photography work. He can build furniture. He's taking a course in electronics. He can fix televisions, and is taking a home counseling course. All the things that enhance life, and I need done for the mission, he does that. But his spiritual self, he's just now beginning to work on it real hard, and decided that that is the soldifier in our life. I have great hopes for him. He was born 1938, forty-one years old.
The next one is Latheda Wash. Latheda, talented, all my children are pretty much talented. Latheda is right now in between jobs. She was an executive secretary. She got married at seventeen, and she and her husband had three children, and they divorced, I guess maybe seven or eight years ago. Since then she hasn't remarried. Her children have married since then, and so she just sold her home about three weeks ago, got an apartment, and she is forty. She was born in 1940. She went back to school after she and her husband separated, and taking clerical﻿39
CW: (cont.) work. She's had no problems about getting good jobs. She's a little fighter. She's taken a couple of them through the Civil Rights Commission and got them straightened out.
MG: These are her employers?
CW: Yes. [laughs] And her problem was at the mission—she was at the
mission every day for years—she had a yen for wanting to protect me from people, people who she felt were using me. She's just now beginning to become spiritually aware,and realize that people don't use you when you set yourself up to help them. She is just now realizing that the things that I offer are the only way that you can draw a certain kind of people,to get to them to offer them something else. And she's really not feeling good; she's the one in the hospital.
MG: What is her married name?
CW: Her name...Little. And the next was Annette Wash. Annette just graduated from the Detroit Institute of Business in accounting. She came out on the dean's list. She's thirty-eight, I guess—thirty-nine, 'cause she's born in 1940, too, the same year that the other one was born.
MG: 1940?
CW: 1940. She was also born in 1940. And she married young and followed her husband around. He was a Marine and for a while, she followed him from one place to another, and I don't know what happened, being left alone, 'cause she drove all the way from California with her two kids by herself.
MG: To come back here?
CW: To come back here. And she come back here with a drinking problem.
Not the kind that don't let you function, but the kind that always... But she's done away with that. It's kind of hard for children of so-called celebrities to make it, especially when it is a poor family. And other poor people resent you. They think that, most of us feel that when people get a lot of publicity, they're going to ego-trip. And most of us do. Most of us are not as free as I am. Anybody can walk in and talk to me. You know, most of them, they've got to...
MG: To go through the secretaries?
CW: Go through the secretaries. And the ministers have got nurses fanning them, and they got... [laughter] So they think, you know, this is... you know, and the children get to be, they think the children are going to be this, that, and the other. And she was another one that could not cope with all the things that happened in the mission. If you help somebody, and then tomorrow they steal something from you. Or you help somebody, get them all straightened out, and then the next week you don't see them any more. And she, they feel that...﻿40
MG: Took it personally.
CW: Yeah, yeah. That's been their biggest problem. Personally taking
it, because that's Mama, you know. But she married twice, and today she's single. And she encouraged her daughter, she's in business school taking accounting. And her son is going into, I think it's the air force. He works at the hospital. He's a very good student. Then she's got one younger boy, twelve. But so far, so good. You know, they're finding their niche.
MG: What's her name?
CW: Annette Lewis. The next one from Annette was Lorraine, the one who called me from California this morning. Lorraine was one that did not get, I think, beyond the seventh grade. And she got married; she married in a family of a group of people where the family controlled everybody's marriage, every...
MG: I know. Sure.
CW: Well, she was in that kind of a family. And then she had four children, and she was on welfare, back and forth. So finally she went to California. And she got a job there as a bus driver. She makes seven dollars an hour. So she's living good. She got her children in school. They're doing fairly nice. She lives in a suburban part of Inglewood. She's got a nice place, own car. And she's doing all right, you know. I think it's taken a while, you know, for some of them to go through these marriages, [laughter]
MG: Get settled down.
CW: To get settled down. And she's going to school, too. She has one boy who learns very slow. He learned reading slow. But everything else he could get, his math and all this... Why, she was just telling me on the phone this morning that he's going to school, and now he's really getting it together. I mean, she spent a lot of money. By her being out there working, she's paid all kinds of money getting him into private schools, even after he was seventeen years old, trying to get that reading going for him. She said, but he's finally getting it, you know.
MG: What's her name?
CW: Her name is Lorraine Brown. She was Wash.
MG: When was she born?
CW: June 14, 1942. And then the next one by her was Andrea. Andrea's the one...
MG: ...I met yesterday. Andrea Wash. What's her married name?
CW: Well, she's been married twice. Her name...we don't call her that name. You ever have anything slip out of your...﻿41
MG: Yeah, I know what you mean.
CW: 'Cause she refuses to call herself that. And I'm... MG: She uses her maiden name?
CW: Yeah. Leave a little space, and I'll get it to you in a minute. [Andrea's name is Nickolson.]
MG: Okay.
CW:
MG:
But anyway she, Andrea...I hope that she settles down...for the need—I mean for the talent she has. She can write. She can write. I just hope she does it. Right now her daughter has leukemia, and she's in Virginia. And that's a traumatic thing. They told her she didn't have but two years to live, but she has lived beyond that. She looks a picture of health. And so she's just really stubborn. They're paying seventy-five dollars a week for a tutor 'cause she can't go... And she's a great
child.
MG: Does she live at home with you? CW:
Yeah. Andrea's always been home, and always did the work at the house and fixing it, except for the time she went to the army with her husband. Then they came back, and then they separated. He is a man that, I think he's in public relations. So that's how her daughter is able to get this seventy-five dollars a week for this tutor. Her father's given that to her. But she's going through this very traumatic experience. You know, when the doctor says, "Well, your daughter's already dead." She was talking to me about it last night. So she feels that she should sue^this doctor. They were so cold and so casual about it. She said, We ve gone through three years of hell, and the child has been robbed of her life." And the psychiatrist suggested that she bring a suit against him. He said he would appear on the stand. So she's really going through something.
They said that in front of the child as well?
CW: Yeah. You know, so she's really going through something, and naturally it spills out on me. The next one...
MG: When was Andrea born?
CW: Andrea was born June 20, 1946. And the next one is Roosevelt Sturkey. Roosevelt is one of mine who has a good heart, a gay, laughing kind of young man. He was born June 30, 19—must have been '47. But he wasn't too long going to school. He went in the service. He's always been military minded. He went in the service at seventeen, and something happened to him there. And I haven't been able to this day, to be able to get them to give him anything. The veterans, you have to be almost dead for them to give you anything,and he hasn't ever been able to hold a job since he come back. And sometimes he'll just stand up and freeze, and I think he's back in Vietnam. Right now he's been, in the last four﻿42
CW: (cont.) or five years, he's been married. The first girl he married, he used to come at midnight with the baby on his arm in dirty diapers and things. The girl didn't take care of the baby. So he left her, and now he's married to a Caucasian girl, and for the last three years, he's been the only black one in the house with four or five white. And he's one, I just don't know which way he's going, really, you know. Good, good manners. He's back in the National Guard. Hopefully, he'll get involved in the military things and sort of find himself, because I think really, I think his wife uses him as a good somebody who will do what she says to. So, I do a lot of praying about him, because a man who cannot control his self to guide himself, he's in trouble.
The next one is Charles Sturkey, and that was the one you seen this morning. Charles, born April 3—must have been 1949. And Charles was six years old when he started preaching. He used to preach to kids. When he was nine years old and you couldn't find him, you'd know he was in somebody's church. Twelve years old, he was ordained as a minister. From twelve years old to seventeen years old, that's all he did was preach, go to school. Lot of talent there, good minister. And he went into the Marines, and he was in the Marines, and he came back a junkie. He got shot over there. And he got shot, and after he come out of the hospital in Vietnam... Just recently, about a year ago, he got off. But he hasn't really found himself yet; he hasn't really got back into his calling. So his calling is really the church. He's kind of lost outside the church. So I'm just watching the results to see if he makes it. And each one of them, I guess if they hadn't have had the kind of parent they had, might have not got as far as they have gotten.
MG: Does he stay with you?
CW: Yes, for the last two months. He and his wife, she's pregnant. So not too much to tell about him.
MG: Where was he ordained—was that in the Pentecostal church, too?
CW: Yeah, the same minister who ordained me, ordained him. Bishop Moore
ordained him, and he really just really reaches for him today. Everybody who knows him, they respect him as minister's material. And they refuse to turn him loose. You know, even when he was at his worst, at his lowest ebb, you know. He was in the intelligence in the service. Never been... Well, they've never been in any trouble, none of them. I never had problems with stealing, violence, doing none of that, even at their worst, never had that. When he was really in drugs, he would still come to church and just cry, you know. So there was something down inside of him that kept him from going too far. But hopefully he's... Well, he'll be thirty, so hopefully he's got a good sense. I was forty-some years old before I was involved. So if I can do this much from forty to sixty, they've got a chance, you know. And Theresa— no, Dennis is my next one. Dennis was born July 7, 19—must have been '51.
MG: This is Sturkey?﻿43
CW: Sturkey. Dennis, he went to the Marines. No, he went to the army. He did his time in the service. I guess he had served about two years. When he came back he, oh, he didn't do too much. But he's working now. He and his wife are talking about leasing an ice-cream business. Kind of steady young man, quiet, you know. His wife works at the gas company. He works at the hospital. So they're just a run-of-the-mill couple, you know. And Theresa, she lives in Azusa, California.
MG: And she's Sturkey as well?
CW: Yes. And she had an interesting life. She was the only one of mine
that I finally was able to send to college. And my husband wanted her to be a doctor. So she went up to Ferris State to nursing college, and it was so radically pressured, she left. The funny thing about it though , she left, and she came back in. She was always a quiet, good girl. Ended up marrying a white boy. She went out with two or three young black boys and she had some terrible hassles, I think, with them, because she had her mind on what she was and was not going to do as a young woman. So along came Jeff, and he came from college, came to the mission. They got married. His father's a banker in New York. Of course, he just absolutely almost died that he married a black girl, especially his wife. And so they made it up about three or four years, and they finally divorced. Jeffrey was a little selfish. They didn't understand how to communicate with one another. He would blame her for not being pregnant. And then finally the doctors told her that she couldn't have any children. She really believed it, you know. And finally they got a divorce. But before they got a divorce, they separated. And there was a boy come in, a black boy came in, looking for his father. He heard that his father was living in a building we had at the time, and he started doing volunteer work around there. Tall black boy, who was not good looking at all. Next thing I knew, he and Theresa was sitting in corners talking to one another. I said, "My God, you know what you're doing?" She said, "I feel like I know what I'm doing." The next thing I know, they were courting, and here was a young man who was just a straggler in, no job, no nothing. And finally, he said, well, he couldn't get a job, he was going to California to get a job. Because my daughter out there in California told him if he came out there, she would help him get a job on the bus, as a bus driver. So he went out there, and Theresa followed him. They got a divorce and married. After about a year and a half, they bought a piece of property that had three houses on it. They lived in one, rented out two. And he went to school, he's going to school for accounting, and drives the bus at the same time. And the next thing I knew, they sold that property and bought a four-family. And the house that they're in out there...has its own swimming pool, has every convenience that you can think of. The straggler who we thought might not be the one for her—I never really tried to say anything there, but I sure didn't think that one was going to be doing nothing. They're doing fantastic. And she's got two children. She's got a girl four years old who, she says, swims like a fish, and they got a little boy who's not quite a year old, who weighs nine pounds, three﻿44
CW: (cont.) ounces. This is the one who the doctors had said she couldn't have children.
MG:	What's her name, her married name?
CW:	Brewer.
MG:	When was she born?
CW:	Wait a minute...May 16, 1953.
MG:	Oh good, okay. So, ten children, how many grandchildren?
CW:	Thirty-three.
MG:	And how many great-grandchildren?
CW:	Right now, there's about twelve. They're still coming.
MG: Can you remember all those names? I'm not going to ask you, but can you remember all those names?
CW: No. You know, I said the other day that I was going to have my daughter draw me out a list. I'm going to have her do me a list so I can remember them all. Hopefully if I'd get some money, I would just rent a hall and pile them all in, and have one big... Wouldn't that be somethingl
MG: That1s fifty-five ipeople—your children, your grandchildren, and your great-grandchildren! Now I want to ask you a little bit about Mr. Waddles. When did you and he marry, and how did you meet?
CW: Well, I was a member of a church, and you know how churches have programs, and as I said, I've always been a ham. Anything I'm in, I work. So we were raising money for the church, and I was living still on Hastings. No, I wasn't living on Hastings. My friend was living on Hastings, and I'd asked her if we could sell barbecue out there for the church, since I was a captain of a group, and each captain was trying to raise the most money. So this particular Saturday, we had the tub out there on the corner, Wilkins and Hastings. And I always say, the smoke was going up, saying, "Whosoever will, let him come." And along come Payton Waddles. And he said to me, he said, "Are you all selling this for the church?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Well, I sure want to buy some. I'd like to help the church." He said, "But I'm going to leave it here and I'll come back, because I'll tell you the truth, I'm going to gamble," he say, "and I'll be back." So he said to the other lady, "Who's that little old lady there?" So she told him who I was, you know. And he repeated what he had to say, and he was telling us that he was going to gamble. And so he was...as he began to pay for the barbecue, it began to rain. These big drops of water began to fall. And I always say God did that. That rain just poured down. And he said, "You know, I got to help you ladies get this in before I go." We had to take the tub to the house, and up on the back porch, you﻿45
CW: (cont.) know. So we got the ribs together, and he helped us take the tub and ribs in.
And when we got up to the top of the stairs, the telephone was ringing. And it was my teenage daughters wanting to go the movies. So I went to the phone and I was telling them, "How much is the movies? I don't have no money for you to be going to no movies!1' He said, "Who is that?" I said, "Well, I've got some teenagers over there. They want to go to the movies." He said, "How many teenagers you got?" I told him that I had four daughters trying to go to the movies. He says, "Anybody over there to give them the money?" I said, "I don't know," I said, "the lady I live with is there." I had moved into this lady's house who was a friend of mine, to help her save her home. I...I was living in a house, and she was about to lose her home. And she was a kind woman who was not as blessed as I to get a lot of things, you know. So I said, "Well, I'll move in your basement and give you my rent. And you save this house." And that's where I was living. So he said, "Well, ask her to give it to them, and I'll give it to you." Now, this is the man who was on his way to gamble. And so we got to talking, and so he decided that he would get a cab and take me home. And I guess we haven't been away from each other since, other than in the hospital or the times he went back and forth during those first two or three weeks. It was about two or three...maybe a week or so...it was the thirtieth of May coming up, and he bought a case of ribs, so that I could have the kids barbecue. He was working at Ford Motor Company. He'd been in the service. He drank on weekends, but never has he ever come home and said, "I lost the money." He's the kind of person that believes that a man is supposed to do for his wife regardless of what happens. And through the years, as we raised the children, I've never had to wonder about the lights, or the gas, or the food or what-have-you.
MG:	What year was this that you married?
CW:	We married December 27, 1957.
MG:	Was Mr. Waddles from Detroit?
CW:	No, he's from Texas. But he lived here since 1928.
MG: Other members of his family, too? Did they all migrate, or did he just come...
CW: No, he came and several other members of his family are in California and Texas.
MG: How did your children feel about your career—that is, I'm thinking of your religious career?
CW: Well, they did not really begin to understand... They've always been
members of the church, they've always liked to be in the choir, they've always participated. But they had mixed emotions, especially about people; they were jealous a lot of the times that people were taking my time away. They felt that I take up too much time, or do too much﻿46
CW: (cont.) for this one, or that kind of thing, you know. A little jealousy—well, not a little jealousy, a lot of jealousy on their parts. But other than that, they've always been very proud, you know, of the fact that I was doing it. But on the other hand, they wish I weren't. [laughs] "Mama," they ask, "how come you couldn't have been a cabdriver or something?" [laughter] And that's why I call my husband Daddy, because the baby was three, I think, something like that, and the rest of them around teenagers, you know. So I called him Daddy, that they might call him Daddy. So everybody calls him Daddy, and he's never had any children, so that's really his family.
MG: How did Mr. Waddles feel about your career?
CW: Well, you know, I would say that he had a vast conviction that if a
person says God wants them to do it, he is not going to fool with that. And he's just been behind me on it ever since. If I need some money to pay the lights at the mission, he goes to the credit union. What more can you do? And still does that, even when our income, you know, is limited to a degree from what it was, he still does that since his retirement.
MG: Well, now apart from any attitudes that your family may have had, your
children, your husband, did you personally ever feel any conflict between the demands of a public and a private life, and how did you resolve these conflicts or prevent them from arising?
CW: Well, you can't hardly prevent them, and you can't hardly resolve them, really I had to let loose the idea of being able to take your loved ones with you, so to speak; have them feel the same things that you feel, the same compassions. I found out that this is something that they have to choose for themselves. That you can not find a place for them and say, "This is a nice comfortable place, a niche. You'd better fit in here." You can't do that. And coming to that decision has been about the hardest thing that I've had to do. Because there's been a tendency always, I guess with any mother or any friend, to want the best for their loved one, you know. And you think the best for other folks is what's best for you, which isn't always so. So I finally reached the conclusion that not to stop hoping, but to stop pulling.
MG: And have you felt pulled two ways, pulled by your work and the things that you want to do in the community, and things that you think you want to do at home?
CW: No. Well, I just gave up what I had to do, for God. I gave up to that, because I don't think you can half-step with God. And to me, serving God takes on a different... I just don't think you serve God by going to church. I think you worship God when you go to church. But I think service comes later. And I think some people are born to do one thing, and some born to do the other. I think I was born with a goodly share of endurance, and I don't think it was just for me. I feel, if I were to let that loose, what else would I do? And I surely am not the one to set out and loll in the sun. And I'm not the one to say, "Well, God, you have to forgive me, but I'm going to do this﻿47
CW: (cont.) instead." [laughs]
MG: How did you run the house? How did you keep it clean, and fix the dinner, and get the kids dressed and off to school, and all those things?
CW: Well, remember when I started, I had teenagers.
MG: So, big children.
CW: Yeah, I had big children. So that made a difference. And I say that was, for whatever reason, that was a blessing, you know. I had children who I could give this chore, that chore, the other chore. Even to my first painting—my children are the ones that did the painting. My first counselors, kitchen help ers, all that kind of thing, were my childr en. The Lord's pushing at them. So that made a big difference.
MG: Who were some of your closest friends, and how important has friendship been in your life?
CW: Oh, friendship has been fantastic in my life. And I think that if everyone would look back in their life, and where they haven't tied it in with a spiritual source or not, we'll find that all the good that ever happened transpired through, with, or by someone. Sometime it's our parent who God always used. I say God always used my husband as the glue that held me together, as the one who kept the need for giving up at a low ebb, because, you know, I come to the conclusion that if I'm going to run it, then I must do it this way, like I would my family. I have to do it in a way that I'm comfortable with. So I don't get up in the morning and say, "I've got to feed so many people." I've got to do whatever I can. If I have enough only for clothes, well, I know that's something I can do today is clothe somebody. And tomorrow, possibly the Lord will bless me to feed them. Whatever my hands find to do, that's what I do that day. I don't push myself to ego-tripping, to feel that because I'm Mother Waddles, I've got to have it all, you know. Because there might be the time that I don't have it all, but whatever I have, then this I can do. And many times, people have come to me and said they got a job. They show me the job referral and all that kind of thing. We check and find out they're supposed to go to work. And they need carfare to get to payday. Well, when I look over my finances and I'm not able to do it, I say, "Well, I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to give you enough for today and tomorrow, and you stop by when you get off from work tomorrow evening, and then I'll take you further. And if I have to give it to you two days at a time, you'll make that payday." Which is the difference. This is what you do for your children. "Tomorrow you come over here, I'll give you some more." This is how I operate the mission. "Well, Miss Jones, I really don't have that chair that you're looking for, but I do have the food. So you come on get the food, and then I'll put you on our waiting list for the chair." Or "Miss Jones, you say you want clothes and food? Well, I don't have anything here but maybe some chicken and some rice. I don't have enough for as many days as you need, but you get the clothes, and you take the chicken and rice and get your dinner going for tonight. You can't eat but only tonight.﻿48
CW: (cont.) And tomorrow you come..." That's how I do it.
MG: Are there any particular friends that you would like to name?
CW: Oh yeah, yeah. I've got one who's... Two, three, four hundred friends off the top of my head. I laughter] Alma Ruff.
MG: What's her last name?
CW: R-U-F-F. She, I met before I was a minister. We became friends when I first started my first program. She's a lady who always had...when she was a nurse, and she had had good jobs, she had nice cars. She had a lot of things going for her. But she came from Mississippi, and she had a lot of hate inside of her. That was the main thing that I was able to pull out of her, tell her that, "You cannot carry..." And I was able to—she told me that she would like to go into the family care business. And I said, "Well, why didn't you tell me?" So I had some friends at Northfield State, and I got her an application. And today, she has three houses, and she's opening up a building that was a convent with twenty-three bedrooms. And of course, for the last three years, she's been just about my banker. She makes a lot of money. And so I know if I get up in the morning and there's nothing there, I can say, "Hey, girl, the cupboard is bare," so she is going to bring me a hundred dollars, or two hundred dollars, or whatever I need. And I, in turn, when her people need some clothing and their allowances are so small, she knows all she has got to do is go to the mission and go through the racks, and dress up her people. And we just got a vice versa thing that's been fantastic. She's been my friend during the lean days... There's never been a change.
Same way with Henrietta Smith. Henrietta, when she came here, she came from a church that she had been a member of for twenty-five years. And in this church, they did a lot of...their missionary work consisted of sending flowers to the hospital, and an occasional visit. And raised the money and the other things. She always had a desire to do some of the things that we do. An extended missionary outreach, you know, that includes people. Ss> she is the kind of person that I can rely on to know that the mission is going to be run, and she's going to supervise, and she's going to chastise and she's going to get it done. Just like I would do. I've gone away and left her. In fact, she went to Africa with me when I went. Alma Ruff had planned to go, but instead, when Reverend Smith was about $400 short, she gave her $400 and let her go. That's the kind of relationship that we all have, you know. In fact, that's what I try to teach the whole group, that you be helpers of one another. Because if we could get a community of people doing that—and this is what has happened with Caucasians. Do you know, Caucasians live in the neighborhood, and if they hear that one of their neighbors is having problems with their business, you know, they call a meeting and see what the neighborhood can do to help him? See, we don't do that. We haven't learned to share enough with each other. We haven't learned that we're interrelated, you know, as people. And that whatever we get is for the releasing anyway, whether it be knowledge... And when we read, "It is more blessed to give than to receive,"﻿49
CW: (cont.) we think in terms of money. But I think in terms of anything that you have, whether it's knowledge, education, whether it's compassion, whether it's understanding—whatever it is that you have, if you share it and you put it out, then you're going to enrich the world in a sense, you know. And she did that, she didn't go, but she is planning if we go again, that she's going next time. I've got so many, many, many folk that I consider friends. But those are the two close ones.
MG: Reverend Waddles, do you have any preference among the terms colored, Negro, or black?
CW: No, really... I really don't. I lived through them all [laughs] and I truly don't.
MG: When you were growing up, did your parents discuss anything with you regarding race?
CW: Not too much. One thing about it, as I say, you know my dad died when
I was very young. And my mother being ill and me out working, we really didn't get into that.
MG: Did you hear other discussions?
CW: I heard my great-grandparents, as a little girl. She used to tell us about slavery, and how they used to use our men to...for stud. And she used to tell us how some of the people were so mean, that they wanted the black people to stay ignorant, and how her master's daughter would slip and teach them. When I happened to see "Roots," I thought about her, you know. So evidently, there were quite a few, as there always is. There are some good ones everywhere you go.
MG: So you had some notions of race, then, early on?
CW: Oh, yes.
MG: To what extent were you in close contact with whites while you were growing up?
CW: Well, all my life I was in contact with them by my dad having this white barber shop, and we lived in an area that was sort of mixed, to a degree. Say, two blocks from where we were, started the white group, you know, and they'd find a way to play. We didn't go to the same school together, but we'd play together.
MG: How did you regard them? How did you think of them?
CW: I don't think I have any real answer. You know, there's a vibration
that you get, I guess, when you're with folks that's different. And I don't even know what you'd call it. You find that wherever you go. I found that I had the same vibration in Italy, I had it in France, I had it in Africa. There's a different vibration you get. But you find what that vibration is. With me I really don't know, other than the fact﻿50
CW: (cont.) that you know that you're dealing with something that's not like yourself.
MG: Were you aware of how white people regarded you?
CW: Yup. I found that out. But not too much. You see, I got enough of the opposite. Say for instance, when I worked for this woman, Jewish woman, and I was brought up that everything...to regard color according to the skin rather than to the ethnic group. I think that makes a difference too. But I also remember walking down the street from this nice lady's place, and passing a place where kids were standing in the door saying, "There goes a nigger."
MG: Now when you worked for the Jewish woman, this was your first job.
CW: Yes.
MG: And how, what was your relationship like with her?
CW: Well, we were fantastic, you know. As I say, she had so much compassion. And then the next woman I worked for, she would even let me wear her clothes. "Are you going out? You better take this dress."
MG: So were you conscious at that time of perceiving something about differing racial attitudes as they applied to ethnic groups within the same race?
CW: Yes.
MG: Did the viewpoints of whites that you came in contact with regarding you, or regarding black people as a whole, in any way affect your own racial attitudes?
CW: No.
MG: Now you've mentioned that the community that you grew up in was rather
mixed. Did other black people apart from your grandparents, your great-grandmother, have any impact on your racial thinking?
CW: Well, see, I didn't have any other relatives, you know, so to speak.
By being young and working, whenever I'd come home from work, I... And then I started, remember, courting at thirteen. So when I'd come from work, it was all about courting, it was all about what I had to do for Mama. We didn't have time for a lot of things that possibly could have come, had I had the usual lifestyle. But mine was so different.
MG: When was the first time in your life that you recall your racial consciousness being significantly heightened?
CW: Well, when I worked for the sandwich shop, I got a better feeling of differences. Many times it was from the attitudes of customers. And you know, customers have a way of projecting how they feel without really even saying anything. I have to think about a job that I had﻿51
CW: (cont.) in a grocery store. And at this grocery store, I guess I must have been possibly in my fourteenth or fifteenth year. And I remember how these people... I didn't have too much contact with what we call Caucasians, but mostly with some other ethnic group. This was a Jewish group also. And I remember how businesslike they could get if there were people around; and then if there weren't people around, how they become chummy, how the young one would always be making overtures. The older one would tell me about jokes he'd played on other Jewish people. He had me to cook a porkchop one time in egg batter, and he gave it to a rabbi and told him it was a lamb, [laughter] And I found out that... [laughs] And he was saying, "Lamb, lamb, lamb," and this poor rabbi just ate that pork, you know.
Then I began to realize that, hey, these people are just fronts, you know. I formed a thought that most of our segregated ideas, most of our hate, are not original. They're passed on. If you live in a family who is full of hate, you may get one out of there who doesn't pick that up. Or two. But most commonly the whole group that follows will be the same way. Maybe eventually one will break loose, but usually people aren't born with that hate, they just pick it up as they go along. Different incidents cause... Prejudice is not always color. I found out in the black race, we are just as bad. We've got light people who don't like black folks , we've got educated people who don't like uneducated people. We've got professionals who don't like nonprofessionals, you know. And I don't know which is the worst.
MG: So what did you find with Jews—that they were one thing with you when
it was just the two of you together, so to speak, and another thing when there were customers?
CW: Oh, yes. Or when they'd get with customers, you know. And then, in working with them, I did a lot of working with them. I found out one thing about them, that they may not want to marry or associate, but they will do you a favor when you can't get anybody else to do it. I've seen many poor persons come to a Jewish person in need, and they help them. You know, by working in different places—I've worked in their bakeries, and I've worked in their dairies and I've worked in their houses and I've worked in their grocery stores. And the people who live in their neighborhood, well, they may charge extra, but there too, you could go back and get some help.
MG: Now you've found that that was a distinctive pattern of behavior that tended to set them apart from other ethnic groups, white ethnics?
CW: Yeah, I think so. I really do, I think they have that kind of feeling, they have a little heart there. We too, I think, have not delved enough into our shortcomings. Because where there is a unnecessary animosity.,.. I don't agree that we should be hating because of what happened in slavery time. I agree that we should be aware, cognizant of the fact that it did happen. But I don't think we should judge people on what happened four hundred years ago. Because when the first slaves were freed, many of us took their freedom selfishly and we didn't help anyone. But I say—and we do that same thing today—those of us who make it, we don't﻿52
CW: (cont.) reach back. And I think that retards our progress. When a person helps you, so to speak, they expect to see you help someone else. And when you don't do it, they in turn think, well, see... And I'm not saying that we're altogether wrong and the other people are altogether right. But I do think there should be some sort of balance.
MG: Do you feel, then that there's no continuing impact upon the lives and the general social position of black people in this country as a result of slavery?
CW: I don't say it's not a continuing thing, but I say that if we as a people would do what we could do generally, we could have done more about it by now.
MG: So you don't see then that racism is a barrier to black achievement in this country.
CW: Oh, no.
MG: You think then if black people, say, put their minds to it, worked cooperatively and these other things that you suggested...
CW: When I say work cooperatively, I'm speaking in terms of what Martin
Luther King did. I don't think that we should take that light and say, "Martin Luther King closed down the buses and the folks had to let us ride." I believe that that was an example that we ought to follow today. We should close down anything that we feel needs closing down, and make people know that we are not so set on having luxuries. But if we went to all those luxurious stores that don't treat us right, and we decided to boycott them, we could do the same thing. I'm still saying that we are lauding him about how he did it, but it hasn't really helped us, because we still not doing it. We're still allowing that to go on and being too passive about it. He tried to tell us what our power was and that you have power. "Okay, ride," you know. "Fine. But walk if necessary." And I say, if the store will not hire your people, go to whatever store that will,and let those that won't alone. And you will prove it.
MG: So would you say then, basically, that black people are today, and have been in the past, in the lowest social economic element of society because of their own fault?
CW: Not really their own fault, but I think that we do not take our lessons
well enough to continue. I'm going back again to Dr. Martin Luther King. I think Dr. Martin Luther King set a precedent that we could follow. And I think that today they should be boycotting anything that won't do right. If they've taken surveys, if—and I'm trying to think of his name, this one man who is so vocal in anything that he feels is wrong...
MG: Jesse Jackson?
CW: No, I'm talking about the white one. Oh, I'm sorry.
MG: That's all right.﻿53
CW: I'll come back to him in a minute. His name will come back. But I believe that if we today followed Martin Luther King's principles, not just remember him and continue to have a memorial service, but keep his dream alive, actually keep it alive by those who walk with him doing what he did, and we could do it anywhere. Just the principle, in neighborhoods. It doesn't have to be a national thing. If anybody moves in your neighborhood and they do not give you the proper prices, they do not give you the proper representation behind their counters, boycott them.
MG:
CW:
You mentioned earlier a couple of times that you didn't feel that black people worked well together cooperatively. What are the kinds of things that you think are absent in the black communities' cooperative efforts? What do you see missing?
Communication. I think that we somehow have too many separate: entities, that each going his own way, and nobody really getting to the core, because basically the people who keep the economy afloat are the poor people, you know, the people who spend their dollar every minute, who run to the store every hour, you know. And these are the folk who got children coming by the large numbers. I think that we can set policies for them, but we don't listen to them. And I think that if we would listen, we would find that they have a lot to say. They have a lot to offer. There are a lot of people who do not have an opportunity to speak, that could... If we didn't have nothing but "It's your turn. What do you think?" And ask people to write in what they thinking. Or have, I don't think we should wait until the big television says it's all right to have a townhouse meeting. We can have townhouse meetings among ourselves in our different churches, our communities, and our folk come together and talk to the people. But we only see them at election time and...
MG: These are black political leaders, now?
CW: Yeah, I'm talking about black folk in general. People who have charge of our lives, people who we have to represent us, people who are out front. We only see them at the time they want to get the position of representing, and then when it's over, we have no input.
MG:
Is it your impression that those people really have any significant power within the overall power structure within the country?
CW: Naturally not. Not too much, because they're in sections rather than an all-over inclusive group. We're talking about the National Black Caucus—what is the National Black Caucus? Who does it...
MG: What's its constituency?
CW: Yeah. And I know for myself, ninety percent of the things that are happening in the city, I don't get invited to. I'm a life member of the NAACP, I get no literature.
MG: Do you feel that's a class bias?﻿54
CW: Sure, I think it is. I know it is. And I've felt the brunt of it
many, many times. You'd be surprised at some of the things that I've experienced, not by white people but by black. I go to a white school, I remember going to a white school in Livonia, and I was scheduled to speak there. And as life would have it, I got there a day ahead of time. So they said, "Well, come on inrMother Waddles, we were just having class about you. We're on your third husband." Okay? And they know everything about me from the bottom to the top. I go to a black school, they don't know who I am. But I imagine almost out of every classroom, some of their parents have been there to get a basket, their rent paid, you know. So we've got a long ways to go.
MG: Well now, why do you think that is?
CW: False pride has a lot to do with it. Forgetting. I know people in
this city well able to help the mission stay on its feet. Right now, my phones are off because of lack of money, okay? And I know people who, through the mission, they were instrumental in being in a twenty-five- or thirty-thousand-dollar bracket today. That shouldn't happen. Okay. Black people. I meet people constantly who say, "Mother Waddles, I'm still on that job you got me, going on my eight years," making maybe ten dollars an hour.
MG: But do you think that those people really have anything? Don't you suspect that the income that at one level looks impressive, has gone into all the sort of symbols of middle-class status—that is, a house, a car, and a college education, and certain kinds of wardrobes? So in fact, there probably really isn't any money there?
CW: Yeah, I know. But you have to make it anyway. Whenever there is a place that will save you if you don't have nothing, you should never let it be in trouble. You don't have to take no money there, but you ought to take some food there. You ought to take your clothes there, you know.
MG: So you're not talking about philanthropy necessarily, you're talking about...
CW: No, no, just little ordinary things that would make it better. Because I know that if we don't do these things for ourselves to a degree... You know, first thing I get asked many times when I go to the Caucasians, "What does your people do for you? Your people ever help you?" What do you say? Well, sure, you know. You can't start saying, "Blah, blah, blah," because "blah, blah, blah" is not there.
MG: But you don't feel, in fact, that you're supported as you should be?
CW: I know, I know so. I know for a fact. And it's, I think, a lack of
understanding. I think it's a lack of people being aware that there's nothing constant but change; that you never know today where you're going to be tomorrow; that I prepare for war in time of peace, prepare for peace in time of war; that things don't happen unless we put them in place. I heated nine rooms for three years with my cookstove to﻿55
CW: (cont.) keep the gas on at the mission.
MG: This was in your home you did this?
CW: In my home. I cooked three years, and called it—the stove—the
iron horse, made it do all the heating so my husband and I could pay the gas bill at the mission. So we've got to learn that we have something we have to do in spite of and because of, we have to do something... You go to any white church, you go into an affluent neighborhood, you go to Birmingham, you go to Grosse Pointe, they've got a clothes closet, and they've got a food pantry.
MG: You don't find that black churches have those same things?
CW: No. No, they don't have them, no.
MG: So in terms of material support for your mission, for this kind of grassroots social welfare effort, you feel that black people simply are not involved to the extent that they ought to be?
CW: No, no. My son, he'd taken a volunteer worker of ours home, an old man who was cripple. He'd taken him home yesterday, and he called me last night and said, "Mama, I'll have you to know he's sleeping on the floor." I said, "What? I knew he'd had a fire recently, and he said he'd got straightened out." Right away, I know of a man who had told me to come pick up a bed. So I told my son to go get it and take the bed to him. But there should be, with all of the things that we have stored away in our closets, in our attics, you know, they should be put somewhere. And they say, "Well, I don't want that. It's old-time." Well, there's nothing old-time. Whatever it is now, has been before, and will be again.
MG: That was the next question I was going to ask you, was whether you thought that what you see as a lack of cohesiveness has been an enduring historical quality or it's something that has a lot of modern-day connotations?
CW: No, it's something that's going...it has not ever been changed. And it's going to be that way until we do change it. And somehow we do have to change it. I look at...in the school system, and they're beginning now to have one-on-one help for children, and we started that back in 1960, 1961, where the people helped slow learners, you know. When I look and I see that just like the bank is set up with a system of interrelationships with money, life is that same thing. And if you use that system in life, then you can make life so much easier for people. It just shouldn't be, what we think in terms of sending it overseas, sending it to Africa, sending it to India. We got a home base, too, that really needs to be taken care of. And when you see our children going to school and they're not learning, much of it stems from what's happening at home, the broken homes. And the method that's come from what happens in the services, and our boys come back from war in pretty sad conditions, and our women are not geared to understand the changes. So their mother, who's a Christian mother, she won't tolerate the change in her child,﻿56
CW: (cont.) not knowing that that child has been given all kind of drugs and all kind of mind-changing drugs, to get them ready to be obedient in the war. And when they come back they're still not themselves.
I was talking to a young man the other day and he's in so much pain. He got shot all up in the service, and he wants to do some cooking for the mission to keep him busy, because he's a retired cook. And he was telling me about the medicine they give him and what effect it had on him other than the pain. And I said to him, "Well, you know, now, you've got to not take that. You're aware that you're going to have to ask your doctor to keep changing that till you yourself feel comfortable with your medicine." We've had a lot of young people today are in such gross disarray of their whole bodies, who came from service. And we're not getting anything, any help on it. And when you go to the Veterans Administration, it's just like beating your head against the wall. These young men are walking the streets in so much trouble. And our young women are not getting the proper kind of husbands, because a lot of it's an overflow from the war. We've got people that the mental health people are putting on the streets that really have no business on the streets. We've got a system that's putting criminals on the streets that really should be inside. Under psychiatric help, they just put them in and take them out, with no help at all. So I believe that the people themselves, the church themselves, will have to initiate and understand and learn these things if we are conscious of our race, our people as a whole, or what will our world be next? And we don't just live and just die, we live to live, and to make changes, and create awareness for people.
I don't know if I'm making myself clear as to what I feel, but I feel that there is a level. And the people who cannot do it, basic things, then they should have some kind of cohesive help, encouragement, from the ones that can, and know that this is just as much a part of them. Because if you take off the bottom rungs of the ladder, you got a problem. It weakens the ladder, and you can't come down like before, you got to fall over the thing. And hopefully...because, you see, I don't get a chance. I've spoken for two thousand Lutheran women at one time. I spoke with white...Catholic sisters of the Teachers Institute. And I found out then that what I thought was happening in the Catholicism, I was a little farfetched. Because I've had those folks, nuns and sisters , cry and kiss my hand, telling me they wish they could have faith like me. I thought they were. This is true. So that I began to look around and take stock of what, what am I doing. And then I began to see. Because there is a difference. There is a total difference. There needs to be many homes by the side of the road, many basic things that need to be taken care of.
I know that, I had a man who came to me, a very educated man, he had a big job. He came to me for moral support because he was getting some feedback on his job that really was upsetting him. Of course, I couldn't do anything but just converse with him. But I was telling him that if he got his job back straight, to take some of his time and spread it out among folk who could really help him, because there's nothing like getting help from little folk when the time come. We have children—I had a little boy who was a volunteer at the mission. The police picked him up, and he came from a good family. Had he not volunteered at the mission,﻿57
CW: (cont.) he would have got railroaded. But I was there to... I have
judges—do you know that judges in suburban areas parole their white kids to the mission in lieu of sending them to jail, hoping that they will find some answers and see some things that will make them turn around? So it's got to have some value. And I don't really know the in-depth that it has, but there's got to be something to this philosophy of having basics somewhere. Everybody can't do it. But everybody can be conscious of the fact that there is a need, and be conscious of the fact that there is something they can do, if it's no more than pray for us, say a good word for us.
MG: Let me ask you a couple of things about integration. First of all, I'd like to find out how you perceive it, how you define it. Is integration full and open access to public facilities, or does it also and necessarily involve social contact between the races in such places as churches, neighborhoods, and homes?
CW: Integration, I think, should really be a manifest thing in a civilized country, and a matter of design. It's a matter, for me, of "I don't want to go to your church, your school, your anything if I am not welcome." I'm very comfortable in an all-black church. And I'm at ease in a white church. But to go out of my way to get there to be a part of it, that's just not me. I think that should be a matter of choice. Like, the same way with abortion. Abortion should be a matter of choice. I don't think nobody should mandate who and who shouldn't, because whatever you do with your life is your special thing, and you have to answer God for that yourself. So I don't think the legislators have a right to call the shots. And I don't think the legislation has a right to say whether a Jew can talk to an Arab. Especially in a democratic society. If we was living in a Jewish country, and nothing but Jews there, well, then that's all right. But this country was built on democracy, and it was the melting pot for all kinds of people, and it was set up "one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." So if they're going to go by that, something tells me they've gone way off.
MG: Do you see any value in the preservation of all-black institutions such as churches, neighborhoods, schools, families, social organizations?
CW: I sure do. I see the value of them, because when I look around at all the other ethnic groups and see what has happened by them preserving their cultures, and how much strength they derive from the preservation of their culture, I'm sure that it would do the same thing for us.
MG: Do you think that black people have lost anything as a result of, well, let's say, the latest push for integration, the fifties and sixties movement?
CW: Yeah, I think they lost sight of a lot of things. Because when I look
back at some of the folks who pushed for it, and found that they married white people, and they went through the... I see that possibly this was the only way that they could get hurt, through the weaknesses of their people. I'm not going to tell you any white folk who are going to marry... and I'm not going to tell you don't work on certain jobs, and not help you prepare for a job. I've seen people﻿58
CW: (cont.) tell folk that service jobs was beneath the black man. Okay,
so now we've got black people walking the streets, and the service jobs are being done by all the other ethnic groups. We've been told that you don't go to the white woman's kitchen. But now, if you're uneducated and you didn't get any schooling, and you cannot be a dean of a college, you cannot be an architect, so you have to work in a capacity that you are able to handle, okay? And that's why my highest capacity is in the serving of people through basics. That's the only thing that I could do and be outstanding in. I'm capable of loving, I'm capable of taking what I can get and giving it to someone else. I'm not capable of being dean of a college, I'm not capable of being a historian, a researcher. But I'm capable of being a missionary. If you are not capable of being anything but a good baby-sitter, they're paying $25 a day for baby-sitters. And for you to listen to somebody tell you about, "Don't scrub nobody's floors," well, they're paying $150 a week for you to push the button. You push a button, you clean the oven; you push a button to light the stove; you push a button to move the vacuum cleaner; and the boss will let you drive her car. today. So we've stood up and listened to a lot of rhetoric, and we've been brainwashed with a lot of black junk by some black folk, and it's got us in a bind.
I went to Mackinaw Island to speak for the social workers' convention, and when I got there, they had about seventy-five waiters who marched that dining room. You ever been to Mackinaw Island? The dining room is as long as this hotel. And on this island they have no cars. No cars. When they marched down there, they had nothing but people from Haiti, people they'd thrown out of the country. Do you know, they're getting them by the thousands and bringing them in here to work on service jobs, because we have been told—and we've been told this by our people—that service jobs are beneath our dignity. Don't be a janitor no more. But in a janitorial job, if the place is big enough, you ride around the floor. You take the...
MG: ... cart.
CW: So to me, I think that—and a lot of people are afraid to even say this— but I know that they have ripped us off with black rhetoric that wasn't worth a dime. And I know women that are sitting and talking about, "Don't scrub nobody's floor."
I have classes—I don't know whether I told you—I had some sales classes last year, and some managerial classes. And a young woman came to me, and I asked her which one she wanted to take, and she said she wanted a managers' class. I asked her whether she wanted food service or did she want it in merchandising. She said, "Either one." I said, "Which one have you worked in?" She said, "Neither one." I said, "But you can't. You've got to choose which one, and then you've got to start at the bottom. A manager has to be capable of doing every job that he manages. You can't go in there talking about a manger's job." And this is where we're at today. People who've dropped out of school, left school, they want to be the airline hostess. You can't be that.
MG: Like you pick them out of the hat.﻿59
CW: Yes, you just can't be that. And somebody's got to tell them. You can be the well-dressed janitor, but if you don't want to wear your work clothes to work, you can take your pretty clothes, put them in your locker, and put on your uniform and go to work, and then go home and wear your gloves so you don't hurt your fingernails.
MG: Reverend Waddles, do you perceive any generational differences in the racial attitudes of young blacks and those of older blacks?
CW:	Yes.
MG:	What would you say they generally were?
CW:	Do you mean in the past, or do I foresee any...
MG:	Well, in the past, and maybe even today, do you see differences?
CW: Well, I see lots of differences because I find that the younger people are... There are a few who have this racist attitude, but as a whole in the... colleges, and I think the large percentage of them are sort of doing away with that. I think that has come along with the movements, the spiritual movements that are going on among the young people today. I find, I spoke to a group week before last. It was called Christian Singles Group. It was out in a suburban area. They'd take all kinds of people as long as you were Christian and single. And you find that there's a great amount of spiritually aware and spiritual outreach among young people. And they're doing away, they're doing away with this racism. And I think we'll, in the next decade, we'll be able to see a great change.
MG: To what extent has race been a factor in shaping your life?
CW: Well, I guess it has. You know, I've heard... We speak so much of the negative, and so I've taken the Bible to see whether there was any such thing in the teaching of Jesus that should make me feel inferior, and there wasn't. So I say, "Well, let me see if I can't do this as a black woman who has a desire to see a religious charitable organization, one that can feed the hungry, clothe them, and take folks indoors, irregard-less." See if we can't help the poor whites who need something. And I use a little psychological thing I do. When I have a white person comes in and needs help, I usually let a black person help them. When a black person comes in, if I've got any of my white volunteers, then I let them help him. Same way when I was sending somebody out. The other week when this woman called, needed somebody to go shopping, I sent a black young man out there to go buy her groceries. Because there's a difference, you see? You may not say, "Here I am, so I'm black." But inside of you, you're going to say, "Who's that who's come to help me?" If you don't say it to nobody else. And I did this, did a lot of little switching and turning to create an awareness that, "Hey, look at me. I'm black, but I'm your friend." "I'm white, here I am." And it's done a lot. It had a lot to do with it. Because underlying all these things that I've done, uppermost in my mind has been to show that we as black people can have charitable organizations, and they're not confined to who has a degree to operate it, and who has the money to make it go, but who has﻿60
CW: (cont.) the desire to do it—and that there is a way to do it, you know.
MG: So you don't feel that race has been a limiting factor in any way?
CW: Oh, sure it's been limiting. Yeah, it's been a limiting factor because, were I a white person, I would have had more funds for this project, you know. But it's been a challenging factor that I've enjoyed every minute of it.
MG: What's your evaluation of the racial situation in the United States today?
CW: Oh, I think it's distressing. For some reason, there is an undercurrent. What meets the eye is bad enough; but under the cover, there is a general movement of "Let's stop blackies now." One thing we are achieving, those of us that have it, and I think the few that have gotten, have done so many outstanding things, until there is a fear. And remember now, I told you they told me that tbs white man locked us up with the Bible. So the white man knows the Bible. And he might have heard that Ethiopia is going to rise because he knows the Bible. And believe it or not, biblical history has a great impact on the white consciousness. And they know without a doubt, black people are on their way. And it's inevitable. They're going to get it. Nov it may not be a black American Negro per se, but black races as a whole cohesively are going to rule again. Why, the white man has already done this to himself. He became too greedy, and he became too hard, cold. Fte's used people like people use chests. He's played with lives like they were nothing. And what you send out, you've got coming back. And he's in a position now, he don't really know what to do himself.
MG: So you see some major changes...
CW: Yes.
MG: ...coming?
CW: There will be some major changes.
MG: Well, let me move now and ask you some questions about being a woman and the women's movement, and that whole area. What would you say is women's work?
CW: I don't think there's no such thing as women's work. I think there's women's duty. I beliave she was made to replenish the earth according to the Bible. And I believe as years have gone by, that God has given her the wisdom to know that she's made in the original likeness of God just like man. And that there is no male or female in learning and in spirit. But I think her job is, if she's not qualified, if she has children and if she is not qualified to do both jobs well, her first duty is to her home and her children.
MG: You mean an outside and a...﻿61
CW: Yes. You know, some women are capable of maintaining a home and a job.
I feel that she should try all that she can to get the proper baby-sitters, the proper...and learn how to maintain a home, learn how to cook up her food and freeze it, and know, learn about freezing your foods, and freeze whole dinners and put them in the box. Her own cooking, her own tastes, and put them in the freezer, and then put them in the oven. When they come out, they're like her own home-cooked meal. There are many things that you can do to adapt to what you've chosen. But I don't think you should choose it and say, "To hell with you, husband." I think your job will still be that of a wife, because, see, you chose to be the other thing. You're a wife first, a mother, and then after that you become a career person. And if that career person should be a versatile enough person to know that she has to take care of her wifely duties, that if she can't be charming because she's got a job, don't expect a man to love her who found her, because [laughs] he's not going to do it.
MG: Do you think that women have a duty to have children?
CW: I sure do. How are they going to come?
MG: But you don't see that there's a basic choice as to whether or not to be a mother, housewife, or career person?
CW: I don't think a woman really has that choice. She might take it, you
know. Because I had ten and I really didn't want ten, but I always say that God give 'em, so I would take 'em. So I had ten, and I raised them with a breeze, because He gave me the wisdom to do it. And I really look back today and wonder how did I raise ten, without the fuss I see people going through with today. But I think that, well, this is for people who believe the Scriptures, you know, and I do believe them. It makes it maybe more comfortable, I guess, to believe them. I believe that the woman just doesn't have the right to say, "I won't have no children." I just don't believe that. And I've seen, I've had friends who died because they've decided that.
MG: To not have children?
CW: Mm hmm. I know one woman who decided not to have no more, and she had
had five. But she stopped herself, and she died. And I've know several to die from abortions. I've had ten, all ten of mine are living. They range from twenty-seven to fifty-two. And I'm sixty-seven. I don't have no wrinkles.
MG: So you really do though see, then, women as having a primary duty and role to be wives and mothers?
CW: Oh, yes. I think the family life is the basis of our race of people.
What happens if you don't have no family? I'm not the authority. But for me and my...I did what I felt that I had to do. I had the one chore I enjoyed.
MS: So do you have some feeling in what you're expressing here against the use of, say, birth control?﻿62
CW: No, not really. I prefer seeing you use birth control rather than abort them. If you really don't want them, I think that you should take every precaution not to get them, rather then to get them and then do away with them. I really think it's a life if it's one day. I don't believe in no such thing as waiting until the heart beats, waiting until...you know. It's a life. If you let it stay there, that's a life. So I really don't think you should have abortions. But then I believe that there's a time even for that, if the people are ill, if they're mentally retarded and they cannot take care of their children. I had a cousin who was mentally retarded, a distant cousin all the way back when I was young. She would just have children and she wouldn't know what to do with them, and this family had to take them, you know, accept them. So I really think that they should be stopped. But an ordinary well woman who just decides that this isn't for her, well, I think she should just use precautions. I really don't think she should abort.
MG: What are your feelings regarding the equality or inequality of men and
women?
CW: Well, I don't understand that.
MG: Do you think they are equal, do you think there are inequalities between them?
CW: Well, I think men and women have different emotions. But when it comes
to mind, I just remember the Bible says there is neither male nor female, you know, in spiritual things, so I think women have as much chance to be a genius as a man. I believe she has as much chance to be an engineer, or what-have-you, as a man. I also, as I said before, think that she has a double duty in being a wife, that she be a mother.
MG: You think that she can express her genius as a mother and housewife as well as she might in a public sort of work situation?
CW: All according to what she's a genius in, you know. Because you can be a genius in many directions.
MG: Well, let's just say, generally exceptional intelligence.
CW: Well, yes, because she can have exceptional intelligence and then still not have the stamina for business. Because it takes a special kind of stamina for business. You can have all the intelligence in the world and don't have enough stamina. I've seen some very bright, bright women who do not have the stamina for husbands.
MG: Can't put up with them? [laughter]
CW: Maybe I'm out to lunch. But I don't really think God made women inferior. I just think that He gave her a body that she bring forth children. And He gave man brawn that he be able to do some heavy things, if necessary.
MG: Do you think that men have a duty to be fathers?
CW: I think man, if he puts himself in the position to be a father, he has﻿63
CW: (cont.) a duty. And I think that a man, also, if he doesn't want the care and responsibility, he should protect the woman.
MG: Do you think it's his primary function to reproduce?
CW: Well, the Bible said to replenish the earth, and I think that if they're... I think the marriage bed is undefiled, I really don't think he should do as they're doing now, reproducing in every corner. Some men got babies everywhere. I really don't think he should do that. I think that he... it's an injustice to the children. Because I think children, if at all possible, should have whatever goes with a good home life. A good home life doesn't necessarily mean luxuries, but it does mean love of two parents, concern. I think that has a lot to do with it.
MG: What I was getting at was, earlier you had said that you felt that women had a God-given body facilitating reproduction. Men have the same. And I just wonder if you felt that their primary roles should be to become
fathers, as women to become mothers?
CW: Well, I don't think it's the primary role for either of them. I think that either one of them could deny sex. I think that sex is a part of, after you become educated, is a part of your thinking. I don't think sex is actually totally necessary. I think it's totally enjoyable but not totally necessary, if you have a preference for something else. Paul said he wished you could be like him—you know, he gave it up. And everybody... But if you can't, you ought to marry. [laughter]
MG: What is your opinion of the term Ms?
CW: That confuses me. I guess I don't have the intellect to cope with that.
M3: You don't like it?
CW: Well, I just don't see why, you know, what part it's playing. I guess I just don't have the intellect to understand.
MS: Well, I think there's a general argument given in favor of its use is
when meeting people, or learning of people for the first time, if they're male, their marital status doesn't enter into their identity. They simply have a courtesy title and then their name. If you wish to know their marital status, if that's important for some reason, you ask the question. Whereas with women, their courtesy title immediately announces their marital status along with their name as though whether or not they are married or not married is more important to their identity and understanding who they are than with men.
CW: Well, as you explain it, that's for whoever wants to use it to be comfortable. I don't think that it's mandatory. They just say it's permissable and let it go at that. Whoever wants to use it, let them be free. [laughs]
MS: What do you say the women's movement is? How do you understand it?﻿64
CW: Well, let me tell you, this women's movement, as well as the men's
movement, has taken on so many different connotations and has brought out so many different things until, again, I'm confused. Because I really don't know the basics of... I see one group over here, the women's movement is one thing. I see another group over here, the women's movement is another thing. Do you read me?
MG: Yes. You're not sure exactly what the women's movement is.
CW: ...women's movement is.
MG: In the general sorts of objectives that you hear expressed about freedom and equality, and rights to equal pay for equal work and those kinds of things, freedom of choice in terms of abortions or not, are you in sympathy with those kinds of goals?
CW: Well, when it comes to abortion, I feel that they could have kept that out of the issue. Because I think that should have been... That's something that happened in your life and I really don't, you know... Same way with homosexuality. I don't think that that should have been an issue. I think that that's something that happens to people. But now, when you're talking about equal rights to equal pay, if a woman's capable of doing a job, I think she should get the same thing as a man. That's ridiculous if, because she's a woman doing it and a man doing it, that she should get any less pay.
MG: You feel she should also have access to the same kinds of jobs men have?
CW: Sure, if she's capable of doing it.
MG: Do you think that the women's movement is in any way relevant or irrelevant to black people and to black women in particular?
CW: No.
MG: To what extent has being a woman affected your career?
CW: Well, I really don't know.
MS: Do you think you might have done different things, more things, had you been a man instead of a woman?
CW: I don't think so. For my kind of thing, I think it's a woman's thing, you know. I think you have to have a mother image, a mother feeling, a mother concern to do what I do.
MG: Rather than a father...
CW: Yeah. A woman's feeling is a little different, a mother feeling is a little bit different. I go into, I've had young men come to me with needles in their neck. I've paid, bought back young men's lives who were in debt to the Mafia. I've sent priests to Canada to bring back people who they were holding on the border. That's a woman's thing.﻿65
CW: (cont.) It's a kind of a child who's in that condition.
MG: Do you see women more in the parenting role than you see men?
CW: Oh, yeah. And I guess because that's...she bears that pain, and I think there's something in bearing that pain, [laughs] I really do.
MG: So you don't see men bonded to children and to family life at all in the same way that you perceive women to be?
CW: No, no. Because you take a man—and this is not all men—but a large percentage of men, the minute they can't really get along with the women, or the mother, they forget the children. Women are not that way.
MG: Do you think that's something, though, that has been culturally sort of induced by the society we live in, and that men could learn to be more involved in parenting?
CW: Well, I believe they're learning. Today I see more men involved. You know, I was at the hospital yesterday, I seen a young man visiting his wife with his little young baby, and she was sitting in a wheelchair. They were visiting in the lobby. And I was admiring him how he was, you know... He said, "I'll take her with me." And he took her on to his back, and he brought her back in. He was a young man. It was a young couple. And I think much more of that is going on today.
MG: Do you think that's a good trend?
CW: Oh, I'm sure it is.
MG: How do you feel about the institution of marriage?
CW: Well, I think the vows could be changed a little bit. In fact, I use a different vow than the regular one that's been handed down for so many years.
MG: How is yours different?
CW: Well, it's...the wording is a little different. I can't quote it too
much. But it's getting people to accept you as you are, to show people— Will you show your partner your whole self as you are? Will you accept me as I am? And we might try to work it out together and do the best that we can rather than, you know... 'Cause that's what it is. [laughs]
MG: Do you think that being married is a preferable living, working arrangement between men and women, as opposed to not being married? Or, say, some other less formal arrangement? Do you prefer marriage?
CW: Now are we talking about folks that are in love, or folks that are not in love?
MG: No, we're talking about foiks... that's what was in my mind, folks that are in love.﻿66
CW: Well, that has to do with the situation and all the underlying causes.
Because I'm not an advocate of marriage by the justice of the peace, or Mother Waddles, being holy. My Bible tells me whom God has joined together, let no man put asunder. So if I join somebody, that doesn't mean that God put them together. And by them living together without the formal paper, does not mean that God didn't put them together. So I think that should again be... Of course, you have to render unto Caesar that which belongs to Caesar, and unto God... It is a protection for the woman and her children, as far as documents and legal procedures go.
MG: But you don't see any moral...
CW: No.
MG: ...preference?
CW: No, I don't.
MG: Now, I wantted to ask you just something briefly about your memberships and the various organizations to which you belong, and your awards and your honors. You have more than eighty awards and honors. The interested researcher will find in Mother Waddles's file accompanying this interview a listing of some of her awards and honors and memberships as of the date of this interview. Why have you found time to join organizations, with all that you do?
CW: Well, I really haven't found time to join them. I've been approached by many and, I guess, conceded to some. Like the Women's Conference of Concern, which is a fantastic organization of women here in Detroit. And I am very proud to be one of their honorary chairpersons. Our council president is Erma Henderson. And I think there's about thirty-five hundred women belonging to the Women's Conference. And then all avenues of causes... land use... In fact, they're having their annual breakfast. I'm going to be in international affairs this year, trying to find out why they're...since I seem to be getting involved in so much international. This year, we're taking back all that we learn, hopefully, in to all the churches. I'm the chairperson also of the ministers' committee within the conference, because I've always advocated that the church should have information there for their people other than just the sermon on Sunday. You'd have five hundred members, and somebody there is going to get in trouble. You ought to be able to go to somebody designated to do that. That's my reason for being a member of the Conference of Concern. I was approached and made honorary chairperson. Of course I was just nominated to be chairperson for the ministers' conference.
What else is there? The NAACP. Dr. Bill, who is the owner of WCHD and WCHB, and he was the first black radio owner, I think, here in Detroit. He's passed now. But for three years I did a show called "Radio Help" on WCHB one hour a day, and he bought me my membership. The last time I got involved in NAACP...
MG: The other one, here, is the International Platform Association.﻿67
CW: Yeah. Now that's always... Lowell Thomas—you know him? Lowell
Thomas, way back in 1973, called me about coming to Salt Lake City, Utah. They were going to pay my fare, and my secretary's, to come out to get the Golden Plate Award, out in Salt Lake City. And I met him there, when I went out there to get that award. He was involved in the Religious Heritage of America. And then here last year, why, they sent me a membership request, and I debated about that, and I even went in conference about that, because there aren't no poor people in there. You know anything about any of that?
MG: Just briefly.
CW: All of the biggies belong to it. And it tickles me whenever I...you
know, one of my members paid for my membership fee. He's paying for it again this year, fifty-five dollars a year. But it puts you in a position—like when this book comes out, I'll send it to them. It's a good vehicle to be involved in and...Abigail Van Buren, all of those people are there. And through that Platform Association is where most of the speakers' juries are set up. So how I got asked, I'll never know. But it was purely—not spiritual, it was realistic—that made me say yes [laughs], hoping that one day, it would serve its purpose.
MG: Now, with these eighty-plus awards and honors, it would take us the rest of the afternoon to go through and talk about them. But what I want to ask you is what they have meant to you?
CW: Oh, nothing too much other than, oh well, you say, the work has... It's good to see young kids when they come on tour. Many times the community services, or some church, or the United Community Service has their daily tours, and they bring them through. Or young groups come by and we give something to them to work forward to. They say, "Oh, you've got all of those?" I say, "Yes, and you know, I was forty years old, and that shows you that it's not impossible." And so, that's all.
MS: What are your hobbies? What do you like to do apart from your work?
CW: More work. I really haven't been able to afford a hobby. I would really like to travel. I would really like to travel, and especially among junior colleges, and psychology classes across the country. Somehow imploring people that, "Don't forget the basics." Because the Letter can kill, and the Spirit can keep alive. If you put them together, they can balance out. But sometimes we get all caught up in the rhetoric and we lose all sense of responsibility to human beings. We become a robot. I'd like to do that. That would be my hobby if I could afford it.
MG: That's what I was going to ask you next. Where you have traveled, where have you been?
CW: Well, I've been to Florida, I've been to Washington, I've been to
Chicago, I've been to Indiana. I've been to Paris, I've been to Italy, been to Switzerland, been to Africa.﻿68
MG: And what was the purpose of your travel? Did you go for business or for pleasure?
CW: Well, I was asked, or people...on speaking engagements, more or less, you know. If you get some publicity, somebody calls and asks you to be their Women's Day speaker. Somebody sends me a ticket, and you go there and you speak. I haven't done as much of it as I would like to. I do feel—and that may be egotistical—I do feel that I have some basics that could help people, that they really forget in their reaching out. Hopefully when this book is done, this Self-Awareness According to the Scriptures is out, hopefully it will take me around to do some of the things I hope to do.
MG: Let's focus a little bit on your travel in Africa. How did that come about, and what was the result: of it?
CW: Well, in 1974, May, Ebony did a story—must have been '73—in '73.
Ebony did a story on the mission. And a young man in Africa got a hold of that Ebony and wrote me and said that he was interested in the kind of approach that I used to Christianity, the kind of missionary work that I was outlining, and he wished that I would send him some literature and some tapes on what I was doing, and some clippings, and et cetera. So then he wrote me back and he said that he would like to organize a group under the Perpetual Mission, and he would like to employ that kind of outreach in Africa, and sort of tell them about loving one another and doing good things, rather than just always reaching out for the higher things, you know. So he did that, and finally he said to me that they were going to have a celebration, and they wanted me there. So I went. In the meantime, when I was getting ready to go, my musician at the time said to me, "Oh, I would like to go. I always wanted to go with somebody who was going to be going somewhere rather than just, you know, going on a tour. Because a tour, they just take you, let you see something," he said, "I'm sure you're going to get to see a lot." So he decided to go with me, and Reverend Smith decided to go with me. And we left.
When I got there, I had several services, and ordained one hundred and ten missionaries while I was over there, and about twenty-eight ministers. We established a school, and I came back. That young man today... And while I was there, he operated just like he had sat beside me every day. It was just funny. So I nicknamed him Reverend Papa. He was a journalist. And today, whenever he writes, he always says Reverend Papa. He operates that mission the same way that I do here. And today it has grown to ten countries in Africa. I've sent you, shown you the letter yesterday, some of the countries that are in it. And we do have a church there in Ghana, and a technical school, and the whole thing.
MG: Now, when was it first established, the African...
CW: 1974.
MG: Branches are in Ghana, as you mentioned, Nigeria, the Ivory Coast, Togoland, Cameroon, Zambia, Benin, Liberia, and Kenya. What effect﻿69
MG: (cont.) has your travel had on your thinking? Has it altered your perceptions of things?
CW: Oh, no. Only thing, it made me know to tell folk in America when I came back, I told the people on welfare how blessed they were. Now we complain about the little that we get on welfare and the little things that we have, but you never knew poverty until you go traveling. You see the mud houses, and no windows anywhere. You see when they say, "Come into the kitchen," you just go in some, another little room with a fire in the floor—no cabinets, no dishes, no...none of that. I realize how blessed are the Americans. I can understand why people who come here don't want to go back. It's unbelievable, it is unbelievable, the poverty. I met an Indian in Switzerland who wanted me to come to India with the program, because they tell me it's worse than in Ghana. But they want me back. In fact, they said I should spend more time there than I do here.
MG: This is in Africa?
CW: Yes. But you know, I can't do that. But that's how it all got started, with one little story in Ebony.
MG: Would you say that people grow wiser as they grow older?
CW: Well, that's up to the person.
MG: What would you say has been your experience?
CW: Oh, I have, but it's up to the person. You take what you see, and
you assimilate it, and then you use it. And then there are some people who just never learn. They grow old, and they still haven't learned. But I think you've got to want to learn, you've got to have a desire to move from onedegree to the other. And you've got to have a desire to do some good with your life. And then I think the way will come, the opportunity will come for you to do it. But you've got to want to do something.
MG: Has growing older for you resulted in a reordering of your priorities?
CW: No, it intensifies, it intensifies. It only made me reach out. I'm about the business now of trying to...along with the other things, is to try to demonstrate to young people not to be fearful of age. You find so many young folk, they don't want to even admit that they're twenty-five years old. You're going to grow old. But you can grow old gracefully. Life can be just as pleasant at sixty-seven as it was when you were young. And I think that's a detriment, when you're afraid of age. And we got so many people who for so long couldn't get any assistance when they got sixty-five, because they had told tales about age so long. So life is made up of numbers as well, so it's better to tell the truth. [laughs]
MG: What would you say have been the most significant achievements of your life?﻿70
CW: Well, to get to the place to even do it—all the challenges, you've got many challenges. And I think my greatest achievement has been my stick-to-itiveness, my ability to see nothing but the good coming my way in spite of whatever happens. I remember walking into the mission, and we had thirty thousand gallons of water in a tower on the roof; and it had flushed it, and water was just pouring all... And I had to take an umbrella to go in the door. And I looked, and, oh, there was this blinking, maddening water pouring all over, and some of your papers getting wet that were on your desk, and you've got to be moving, and you can't see. And I looked at that and I said, "Well, God's just putting up a smokescreen. He's got something good for us." And it worked out, because we were financially having problems, and by the time the press came and taking pictures of all of us, hasn't God sent the money. So God's got all kind of ways.
My ability to stick to it and not get ulcers [laughs], you know, not get bitter, or sacrilegious, but to just move from one day to the other, and still be what I started out to be. You can go away twenty years and come back, and if I'm living, you know you're going to find me, whether it's in a mansion or a shed, be doing the same thing. I've been reduced to go back to my home. I had the mission two years ago in the house. And the big eighteen-foot trucks sitting all outside the gangway. But I'll still do it. Because I didn't promise that I would do it contingent upon what kind of building, what kind of clothes I could wear, what kind of money I had; just as long as I can find something I can do, I'll do it. So no matter where I'm going, people can at least know to pinpoint me in what category I'm in. Without even asking anybody, "I know wherever she is, if she's alive and well, she's a missionary." So I think that's my greatest achievement—to find yourself, and know who you are, and get joy out of being you. Because that's what life's all about, and it's not dependent on your ethnic group, it's not dependent on your monetary value, your education. But it is dependent on how you feel about you, and your stability, and the peace of mind that you have. I'm not afraid of my age, and I'm not afraid of having to die. I'm not afraid of anything. I just live from day to day, and do the best I can each day, and enjoy.
MG: What's most important to you right now?
CW: What's most important to me right now is to get enough money to stabilize the mission, stabilize it so that at my expiration, it will be still there, and servicing and helping, putting in some programs that will have some monetary rewards that can be channeled into the general mission fund.
MG: Well, that brings us to the conclusion of the formal questions that I have prepared for you. Is there anything you can think of that we've not discussed, that should be added to the record?
CW: I don't...you've been very thorough. I really don't know anything.
MG: Well, maybe if you think of something in the interim, you'll add it﻿71
MG: (cont.) to the transcription of the interview. CW: Okay, I'd be delighted.
MG: Well, I want to thank you, Reverend Waddles, very much for a very interesting and very important interview.
CW: Thank you.﻿CHARLESZETTA WADDLES
