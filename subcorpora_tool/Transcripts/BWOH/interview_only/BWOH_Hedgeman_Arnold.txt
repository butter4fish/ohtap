Ellen Craft Dammond: We're going to interview Anna Arnold Hedgeman today,
December sixth, 1978, which interestingly enough is also her husband's--the well-known Merritt Hedgeman, concert singer, now retired--it's his birthday. So it's a particularly significant day for both him and Anna Arnold Hedgeman. And this interview is for the Black Women Oral History Project, under the auspices of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library at Cambridge at Radcliffe. Dr. Hedgeman is being interviewed by Ellen Craft Dammond.
Ann, you and I talked many times before, and of course we did a tape once. But today we're going to start from the beginning and do a tape with you in order to get the broad aspect of your life and your thoughts, and try to get them all down in this really brief period that 'we have, to have you share your thinking with the women who will use the library for research in years to come. And for that reason we're very anxious to have your thoughts. Let's start with kind of how you began to be. You come out of the Midwest, did you not?
Anna Arnold Hedgeman: Yes. I was born in Iowa, Marshalltown, Iowa, which
I intend to visit someday. I've been over a good bit of Iowa, but never visited Marshalltown.
My parents lived there until I was about two years old, and we then moved to Dover, Minnesota, where my father bought a harness shop. This makes it necessary for me to say that he was born in Greenville, South Carolina, but at an early age attended Clark University at Atlanta. There he spent his grade school, high school and college years. He was very fortunate, because as the son of slaves he had more than the casual interest in education. Education was almost a passion with people who had not had the opportunity. And so for him this was a very exciting experience. He also had another advantage there.
Ellen Craft Dammond: May I ask you one question? You said grade school,
elementary school; could you explain that for those of us who only think of Clark University on the university level?
Anna Arnold Hedgeman: Most of the African American colleges across the
South made provision for elementary, high school and college education, because the local school systems did not include them. And if separate ones had been﻿Page 2
set up, there was not the money available among the African Americans to make that possible.
And so the colleges had this extra responsibility. This is one of the reasons that some of us are so very eager to see the African American colleges in existence now remain in existence. For they have a quality of experience that few other colleges have in this country, and at this time of transition the college world needs to know more about these colleges and the kinds of things they did to improve education in the general society.
This, also--the second factor that was useful was that it was realized that these young people had no advantages, and therefore they must be prepared two ways: academically and from the standpoint of a trade. Academic openings were rare, but trade opportunities could come, and as slaves they'd done most of the kinds of occupations which were then important. And here1s the second advantage--this faculty was an integrated one. It was integrated in two ways: you had your Northern, Massachusetts schoolmarms, they called them then, men and women coming South in a kind of zealous, almost Puritan missionary spirit, to help these former slaves-children of former slaves--find their way educationally. And for those New Englanders, a classical education was necessary.
The same thing was true of the African American teachers who were there. (We said Negro then, or black now, but I use only the term African American.) Those teachers were there too. For there's a whole--again using the word they used--a whole, free Negro group which also was available to teach. And those two kinds of people joined each other. The brethren white, missionary-spirited, from the North, and the Southern African American who was recently out of slavery. Or, in some instances, had bought their freedom as indentured servants and were never really slaves. It was that combination of things, plus the children of the slave era...
ED: A rich mixture...
AH: Oh, a rich mixture. So rich that my father lived most of his adult life on his relationship to that kind of heritage. Now the trade he learned was harness-making. He was a Latin and Greek scholar, and I use the word scholar advisedly, because he had the quality of instruction from (maybe you even know the name) W. [William H.] Crogman...
ED: No I don' t. . .
AH: Oh, you must see his picture, African American. There's where he picked up the classical, merging it with the total history of the country. And with that combination of a classical education and a trade, the teachers of that period felt that these young people would be more secure, since they knew that they would have little opportunity in the general academic, or broad business world for that matter.
ED: Now your father got to Atlanta at a very young age?
AH: Yes.﻿Page 3
ED: Did he go with his parents?
AH: No, they lived--they remained...
ED: They remained in Greenville.
AH: ...for a long period...
ED: ...and he was sent...
AH: ...yes...
ED: ...in the care of someone? In elementary school?
AH: No, the schools accepted responsibility in those days.
ED: I see. Boarding school and elementary.
AH: Boarding schools accepted responsibility. The young people stayed pretty much in the general buildings or with the other students. They were, incidentally, older than the elementary child that would go today. In fact, the first elementary young student I knew on the campus where I finally taught was from the countryside. And when I met her, at fifteen, she'd only had two days in school at all. So there were all these kinds of combinations of experience in that s choo1-age group.
ED: Did your father ever share with you why his parents chose that particular school?
AH: No, no. I would assume, knowing Greenville now, that it was closer than some of the other colleges. Greenville is almost the last stop before you reach Atlanta, and I used to get off the plane in order to just put my feet on the ground since he had come from there. However, the harness-shop business gradually deteriorated because we had the beginning of cars, just the tiny beginning but enough to make the harness trade less viable than it had been.
ED: The one he established in Minnesota.
AH: Yes. And so he left then for St. Paul, Minnesota.
ED: What was the town he was in?
AH: Dover, Minnesota.
ED: Dover, I see. And he left for St. Paul.
AH: For St. Paul. I suspect I was around four or five at the time and we stayed in St. Paul a couple of years, and I remember that so vividly because my father was in the earthquake of nineteen hundred and six. And I...
ED: The earthquake in...?
AH: San Francisco.﻿Page 4
ED: Oh, he was visiting out there?
AH: No, he was working there. He traveled a great deal nationally and he was out there at the time. And I remember it so vividly because for six days we didn't know whether he was living or dead. And I shall never forget it. His mother and father were with us at the time, and my grandmother looked out the window and saw a telegraph boy coming and was so excited about it. She said "Oh, he's all right, here comes a telegram." And my mother said, "Listen, you don't know what it says yet!" (laughter)
ED: But she had a positive outlook. Instead of saying, "Oh, I know it's bad news," she said, "I know he's all right."
AH: And no uncertainty at all. And sure enough, the telegram said, "I'm well and on my way home." (laughter)
ED: Perhaps someone that can remember the San Francisco earthquake really, you know, relates this to history, doesn't he?
AH: Yes. And there's been much di.scussion of earthquakes on the West Coast recently. Well anyway, in St. Paul we stayed only a relatively short time. I recall my father saying that he did not want us to grow up on city streets. And I don't know of the intimate detail involved. My mother was always ready to do what was best for her children. She loved children. She used to say, "I wish I could have many many more just to see what they'd be like."
ED: How many did she have?
AH: Six. Really seven. The first--her first child died, but six who lived all the way through.
ED: And where were you in the group?
AH: I was the oldest.
ED: You were number two, but number one.
AH: Number two, but number one in actual living. Anyway, father finally selected--and I don't know the details of that, I wish I did--Anoka, Minnesota.
ED: A-n-o-k-a.
AH: It's an Indian name, and one of the oldest towns in the state. And a town then of about 5000 people.
ED: And now?
AH: Farmers, and people related to the development of the town. The
grocery store, the general stores, merchandising and all that sort of thing, department stores, churches--and saloons! (laughter) I remember that so vividly because there were twelve in that small town. And my father was one of the founders of the whole Prohibition movement across the country. And he was out on the West﻿Page 5
Coast on some of that business at the time. In fact the amendment, the Prohibition amendment, was drawn up by a group of men with whom he was associated (and he was really quite the leader), and lobbied in Washington and all of that for the passage of the bill because he said, "Alcohol would be a number one problem in this county if we weren't more thoughtful about it." And that's way back in nineteen what-was-it. . . ?
ED: So many young, black women that you talk to, Afro-American--African American that you talk to...
AH: Yes, no Afro. We're not hyphened. We're total, (laughter)
ED: African American women that you talk to of your age and younger tell of growing up in homes that were very--if not -active in the Prohibition movement—but very strong on the non-alcohol.
AH: Yes. They realized, you see, what it would do to the boys who had such handicaps already, and they didn't need another one. And my father would have called it an escape from reality.
ED: Tell me about your mother. You mentioned briefly that your mother would have done anything that would have made your father happy.
AH: She was one of the most talented women I have ever known. She was a beautiful woman. I always regretted that I didn't get some of her beauty...
ED: Well, I was just about to make the remark I could believe she was a beautiful woman.
AH: Well, it wouldn't be from looking at me, that's another story. She was a very beautiful woman, but most of all extraordinarily talented.
ED: Along what lines?
AH: She'd been interested in theater by the way, and studied in Chicago with Richard B. Harrison, do you know that name?
ED: Yes, I do.
AH: Richard B. Harrison who was prepared to play Shakespeare, knew his Shakespeare. He was a tall, gorgeous, sort-of, built person, and a very interesting human being. And really wanted to do Shakespeare in theater. They wouldn't let him do it. And guess what they let him do? Remember?
ED:	Yes.
AH:	They let him be God on Broadway. Well he had taught...
ED:	God in ...?
AH:	Green Pastures.
ED:	Green Pastures, right.﻿Page 6
AH: Green Pastures, a travesty on our religion, but many people didn't know it, because of Richard B. Harrison and the music...
ED: ...the opportunity of...
AH: No, no. The fact of him, what he did, and the music, which was Hall Johnson's music, and great music.
ED: Hall Johnson, I'm sure is a man you knew, didn't you, right here in Harlem?
AH: Yes. Everybody had to come to Harlem because this was Mecca. In
fact I'm in the midst of doing a book, calling it Mecca. For it was just that: all the "greats" came here, and you met them and talked with them. If you were as brash as I was, you went up right away to ask them a question, because I wanted to know so desperately. My mother...
ED: Later on in the interview we want you to share your days in Harlem, when it was the Mecca.
AH: And, it still is. It still is, but people don't know it now, which is another kind of story.
ED: But your mother, now where did she come from?
AH: St. Paul, Minnesota.
ED: So she was in St. Paul then.
AH: She was, she lived in St. Paul most of her life.
ED: But your father had met her where?
AH: In Chicago. She was living in Chicago; he was going through. He
had organized a group, a group which covered a lot of music. He had a beautiful tenor voice. I always say that in later years--I laughed at myself--I really fell for my husband when I first heard him sing, and I'm sure that there was a little bit of a playback because my father had a beautiful voice. He had this group and they moved across the North and the Midwest doing what they called "Songs and Stories of the Southland." I'd give anything if I had some of that material.
ED: And of course at that time nothing was recorded, was it?
AH: Nothing recorded. It should have been.
ED: Do you know the name of the group?
AH: No, I don't even know that. I just remember seeing the throwaway which said on it "Songs and Stories of the Southland." And I wondered what the Southland was, really, because this didn't say anything to me in terms of what might have been the program they developed. When he reached--my mother...﻿Page 7
ED: He came to Chicago.
AH: Yes, and they met there. Chicago was a very exciting place then
because it was perhaps next to New York, in terms of the varieties of people who came in, and also it was kind of the big city of the Midwest. Most people planned to get to Chicago somehow because there was the beginning of a great many things.
ED: This would be toward the end of the nineteenth century, wouldn't it?
AH: Yes, last century. Because I was born in 1899, and I was the second child, so that gives you some relevance of date. I remember one of the exciting things was the Chicago Fair, the World Fair [Chicago World's Fair], which took place in the last century too. And mother talked of it. She was also interested in everything. She read a great deal...
ED: Her talent was in music or in theatre?
AH: In everything. She taught all of us piano in the beginning. And I don't know now just the detail of her having learned it to do it, but she taught us all piano up to a certain point, and then we went to a teacher for advanced work.
ED: Did she talk much about her parents, were they...
AH: Oh, we knew them.
ED: They were from St. Paul?
AH: Her father worked with James J. Hill. He was born, I believe (and I have to check this out) in New Orleans. But he lived in Minnesota for a very long stretch, that's how mother happened to go to elementary school and all that, there. He was with James J. Hill, the great railroad builder. He had charge of Mr. Hill's private car. And you have never met anyone who had such an aristocratic air about him.
ED: The elegant manner.
AH: He was absolutely elegant. In fact for me annoyingly so because you lived in pretty much an atmosphere where you saw farmers and more people who were not as pronouncedly determined that every day the tie was on the proper shirt, and all the rest of it. He was a fabulous cook. He had to have a dozen eggs for a cake. He was out of a French combination...
ED: Out of New Orleans, right?
AH: Out of New Orleans.
ED: And his wife, your grandmother?
AH: We didn't know her, she died when my mother was three. We have a painting of her and it's very lovely, and we know that one of my sisters was very like her. So we were glad to have that painting. My grandfather, by the way, carried his free papers.﻿Page 8
ED: Papers that he gained his freedom or that he was born free? AH: No, papers that he was born free.
ED: What was his name? What was the last name, does it come to you?
AH: William H. Parker.
ED: Parker. New Orleans.
AH: He explained to me that originally it was Parquet, P-a-r-g-u-e-t, but they had changed it.
ED: French.
AH: Yes. And my mother's aunts spoke French better than she did
English. So there was that kind of combination out of New Orleans.
ED: So your mother was born in St. Paul.
AH: No. She grew up in St. Paul. I am not sure that she was born there. I am in the process of checking that out.
ED: She may have been born in New Orleans.
AH: No, I don't think so, because as I remember the time sequence, they were out of New Orleans. But anyway she died--the grandmother died--and so I didn't ever talk to her.
ED: We're up to your father meeting your mother in Chicago.
AH: Yes, and they... ED: Married there...?
AH: Oh, and I was finishing with her various talents. I said she taught us piano. She also taught us how to read poetry, effectively. And every Sunday night at home we had an evening. I was usually the MC because I had no great talent. My second sister could sing beautifully and played the piano a bit. The third one played the piano very well. They were always on the program, you see, and I MC'd it to keep it all moving.
ED: Well your MCing is sort of a foreboding or antecedent of your days of becoming an active political woman.
AH: Yes. My father and mother both believed that the family needed to
express their talents with each other so you had a very busy kind of life preparing for your Sunday on the show. I used to do some of the recitations, that is, some of the poems that I thought particularly interesting, so that I could put myself on every once in awhile. But we did this, Mother and Dad were the audience, you see. And when Dad was away--he was away a great deal--and when he was away, Mother was the audience. And we were subjected to criticism over what we had done, or what we had not done, (laughter)﻿Page 9
ED: Wonderful!
AH: It was very exciting.
ED: It's a wonderful kind of experience to share with us, and so lacking today in many situations, don't you know that?
AH: Well, the time element has so changed, too. She taught us piano, taught us to read. I learned to read through my mother. When I went to school I was very proud of the fact that I could read before the teacher started off attempting to teach me, you know, (laughter)
ED: When you entered elementary school you were the usual age, five or six...
AH: No, I was seven. My father insisted that he did not want me to
enter until I was really old enough to accept the responsibility of it. But I have a notion that he just hated to see me leave home, I really think that.
ED: But I think also his view was a very interesting one.
AH: So I was seven when I started school.
ED: And now this in St. Paul?
AH: No, this was in Anoka. We moved from St. Paul to Anoka, and we
started school there at the Lincoln School, which was the elementary school. My first teacher, very interesting to me because she coiled her hair around her head, just as my mother did, and she didn't know it, but she became a sort of second mother in my mind.
ED: Was schooling through elementary and high school in Anoka?
AH: Yes.
ED: What was the name of your high school?
AH: Lincoln High School.
ED: Oh, I thought that was the elementary.
AH: That was the elementary.
ED: But high school?
AH: Anoka.
ED: Anoka High School. And you graduated?
AH: From Anoka High School. Nineteen hundred and eighteen. A very,
very important year, because we had wanted to meet some of the young sons and daughters of my mother's friends in St. Paul. And an aunt (who was really not a blood relative but a schoolmate of my mother in elementary school in St. Paul), who still lived in St. Paul, she was nice enough to invite us down for Easter Sunday, nineteen hundred and eighteen. In fact it was Mafch thirty-first, and this﻿Page 10
was the first time we had met a group of young people, sons and daughters of friends of mother's, but African American, you see.
ED:	Because in Anoka...
AH:	We were the only family there any length of time...
ED:	The only African American family.
AH:	That's right. Occasionally, a family would move in and move out.
ED: So your early years were really spent mostly with little white children.
AH: From the time--this is ridiculous I think now, but it's symptomatic of the conditions in our country--from the time I was in first grade school through college I was never in the classroom with another African American student.
ED: So you were the only, all the way through.
AH: All the way through. So this meeting, you see, of these young
people, was terribly important. Because my father had brought me up on the background of his Clark University classmates, and I expected whenever I met an African American they would be somebody better than anybody I had known.
ED: Wonderful. Interesting point of view.
AH: Two things happened that were terribly important. Because I grew up within a white community, ranging from an ordinary human brute, to your almost peasant-type, to your businessmen, bankers, and so-on, all the way through. And then college professors who were mostly Ph.D.'s etc. I came to know and evaluate white people just as I would anybody else. There was no sense of their having any superiority that I later was supposed to believe they had. I always had the corrective.
ED: That's an interesting experience for an African American person, isn't it, to start you off on a different level.
AH: Yes. It's not unusual. It was not unusual, and I've met many people since who've had the same experience. But it was not commonplace, let's put it that way. And I've been very grateful for it. No point over-evaluated then...
ED: ... out of?
AH: ...good, solid experience; and varied experience. From the farmer to all the other types I've described.
ED: So you went to St. Paul then?
AH: Yes.
ED: ...to meet these African American friends.﻿Page 11
AH: Oh, I didn't say I went that way; I went to spend Easter with my
aunt. Now the reason I'm making that distinction is my father was a little concerned that we might be moving into a "society" kind of situation, and he wanted no part of it until we were through college. This was his general concern.
ED: Man of strong ideas.
AH: You keep your relationship to your school and church, those were the two important factors in your life. So he wasn't very happy. I hoped he wouldn't get home before we left because I was sure he'd find some reason for us not to go. And sure enough, on the Saturday night before that Easter, he was home. And he said to us, "Now, of course, if it's raining tomorrow you won't go I'm sure." Well we didn't--no three children ever prayed for sun as we did that day! 'Cause it was cloudy out, you know, and we each had our new outfits, always Easter-time was the time we changed into spring clothing. And I had my first high heels, that was always a sign of your having grown up, unfortunately, as high heels aren't good for anyone. But, we didn't know that. I had my first high heels. They were grey, kid boots which laced way up, halfway, midway of the leg. And a grey dress to go with it, trimmed with lovely rose colors and a big, black hat (I'd wanted a big one! Mother wore them so well), this big, black hat. And it had around it a touch of the rose and grey. And my coat was a soft spring green. I was prepared to be very elegant. And here it might rain! We were fortunate--the streetcar ran into Minneapolis, and then you picked up another streetcar from Minneapolis to St. Paul, the twin cities. So we were on our way to St. Paul.
ED: Was this your first visit to St. Paul?
AH: Yes.
ED: Despite its being so close...
AH: Yes. We went to Minneapolis first because that was the shopping center, we went for shopping. Not for visiting. I didn't know anyone in Minneapolis, and Mother had gone to St. Paul so she knew everyone there. And this aunt of mine who was a classmate of hers in grade school had invited us, so we were going there for dinner, and for church in the morning--we didn't mention that in the afternoon she might have some friends in! Which she did. And so we met half a dozen young people. One of them was Roy Wilkins and his sister Armeda (she's long since dead, so you wouldn't know her name). His sister was as cute as she could be, and of course Roy was the most outgoing person you ever met. And all the young people liked him. And then there was the daughter of the editor of the St. Paul Appeal he was African American. John Quincy Adams, incidentally, showing how we're all related, did you know that?
ED: That was his name?
AH: That was his name, John Quincy Adams. And his daughter was there, Edith Ella: Edith for one relative of his, and Ella for her mother. Edith Ella Adams. She was the most sophisticated young woman I had ever seen. She didn't bother to communicate too much. She was very﻿Page 12
beautifully groomed. And looked like one of my Irish neighbors. She was very fair; John Q. Adams was too. Well anyway, that afternoon was very special. We also met Muriel and Carlos Alexander, two young people who were well known, and sons and daughters, as I said, of my mother's friends. So it was a very wonderful day. Of course when we got home we began talking about all the church. Oh, I went to church in the morning!
ED: In St. Paul?
AH: St. Paul. St. James A.M.E. Church, African Methodist Episcopal.
You see those early people always used Africa. They knew where their roots were, and how important they were. African Methodist Episcopal Church. I grew up Methodist because my father was Methodist. My mother was Catholic (New Orleans again) and was confirmed in the Catholic church.
ED: Your mother was.
AH: Yes. But she felt that mother and father...
ED: But she didn't insist that the children become Catholic...
AH: No, no. Mother and father ought to have the same church
relationship, and so she joined my father's. There was no way in the world that he would have become Catholic. And so she made that choice for him..
ED: Now you said your church was the Methodist Episcopal, but not the A.M.E.
AH: Not the A.M.E. Because there was none...
ED: Because it was a white church...
AH: It was--as far as I was concerned it was my church and it had nothing to do with their being white within it. But, it was actually as I learned later, a white church. Well, Sunday ended, and we came home all thrilled to talk with my mother about it. I didn't intend that Dad overhear me.
ED: I was going to say, "What did he say?"
AH: I think he was busy at the moment, but somehow he did hear me. He was very upset that my aunt should have had us for dinner merely to introduce us to some kind of social life which he didn't know anything about. But we survived that because Mother said, "Oh it was natural for her to have some people in, and they were sons and daughters of friends of mine." And most of them were. Roy wasn't, Roy wasn't born there in Minnesota. You had to be born in Minnesota to really count, you see.
ED: Where was Roy born?
AH: Pioneer...
ED: Kansas?﻿Page 13
AH: Kansas City, in Missouri at least, I'm not q\^ite sure of the spot.
But, those people who really made it were pioneers. That meant that they'd established the country. Since everybody but me had been born in Minnesota, they were all eligible, you see. All this silly business. Everywhere in the world though, there are certain kinds of distinctions that make the difference, and the pioneer in Minnesota was very important because they made the country.
ED: They made the land...
AH: They developed the land, they suffered all the privations. And they were filled with immigrants: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, occasionally a Lithuanian, occasionally a Hungarian, occasionally a Finnish.
ED: So you were surrounded by this, and I think your father probably considered himself a pioneer too, didn't he?
AH: I would not say that. I think he had very great love of the South and thought of it as more cultured than the Midwest. So he never quite accepted the Midwest in his own personal terms although he loved it, understood its resources, was pioneering for the interplay of the region, for a development of the region. He had a newspaper which he called The South Dakota--surrounding the South Dakota development idea. North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, he saw as a regional area with enough resources among them to really establish a viable economy.
ED: This is very interesting...
AH: Way back then.
ED: Did he edit this paper?
AH: Yes. And I'm going to try to get my hands on some copies of it.
Senator McGovern's father [Joseph C. McGovern] was a great friend of his.
ED: Was your father political?
AH: He was, even as I am. Neither of us was ever political in the real sense. But, he understood that people had to influence the political scene, and he did it, whether it was the Prohibition amendment, the battle for more development within a region, his concern with alcoholism, his concern with pollution, way back then.
ED: And in an area that we think of as pollution-free even today.
AH: And the water, the importance of water. He helped set up at one time a plant for distilled water because the water was not--of course the purest spring water was something else, but by this time everyone didn't have it. And then he had studied Montana very carefully where the resources were wasted beyond belief. The story of our waste of resources in this country began, in my thinking, with his talk of it.﻿Page 14
ED: Your father was an amazing man for his times, wasn't he? This
combination of the man out of the South, going North, establishing a harness shop, bringing his family up with such a strong sense of what he wanted them to become. It's a wonderful heritage.
AH: And moving into the world. I think now that one of the advantages he had was he was rather fair. And often he had established his concern for good government, for prohibition, for preservation of the resources of an area, for good water, for all of the positive crusades--I think got established in his mind to the extent that he was prepared to fight for them, but also he had the opportunity to sound his idea before, somebody said, "You're Black," or "You're Negro and you don't rate." So that he used Presidents of colleges, chambers of commerce, railroads, sold stock on Wall Street for the state of South Dakota when nobody else could sell it. In all of these instances, in the beginning, he had a chance to present his talent before they figured out who he was. But he never failed any time anybody ever asked him. In fact, a white man in Dakota approached him once and said, "I've just heard an awful story about you." And he looked astonished, and he said, "What kind of story?" "That you have a Negro family hidden away in Anoka, Minnesota!"
ED: Didn't you say at the beginning that he was the child of slaves?
AH: Yes.
ED: Well, oh, one of them was fair, one of them.
AH: My grandfather, on his side, was as blonde as any white man you ever saw, with big blue eyes. I remembered his eyes specifically because he was blind. And I couldn't figure out why, with that beautiful eye there, he couldn't see me, as a little bitty child.
ED: He was like many of us, a product of the---
AH: Of the slave system. Now my father never talked about that, I think it hurt terribly.
ED: Once I asked my father about that, and he said "When you're that
close, you don't talk about it." And now we almost romanticize, you know, background, in terms of slave forbears. But my father said, "When you're one generation away," 'cause I asked him why Grandmother had never let Grandfather talk about being the child of runaway slaves. You know he was a wise man. And he said, "When you're one generation away you don't want to talk about it; it's too painful."
AH: I suspect that was it. And also his most important memories were of Clark University. And I think that, combined*with the fact that his mother and father were always interested in him and backed him. And the fact that one of his sisters, his oldest sister, was a real supporter of anything he wanted to do as a youngster. I'm named for her: her name was Anna. And I had problems because the name was Ann. I was expected to be as excellent as he thought she-was, which was kind of an interesting twist on heritage.
ED: Did he begin to talk about college while you were in high school?﻿Page 15
AH: Oh, no, I'd always known I was going to college. I couldn't tell you when...
ED: It was understood.
AH: Completely.
ED: For all the children?
AH: Yes.
ED: Didn't you tell me something once about he wanted his boys and girls raised quite similarly?
AH: It wasn't that he wanted it, he just did it. Now that didn't mean, though, that he wasn't as masculine as that time. In other words he was head of his household.
ED: A household run by the father.
AH: Yes. He thought. Women always have their ways of seeing to it that there is a shift when there needs to be. And when children need more outlet than the father sometimes wantd to give them, she was there and, at the same time, she never at any time negated him. I remember when I was about sixteen I was furious at something he'd done, or an attitude he'd had, I don't remember the details of that, but I remember telling my mother I hated him. She sat me down, she said, "Listen. There will be things that he says to you that you do not believe or do not like or rebel against. And I don't always agree with your father. However, I have learned to listen and evaluate. And I want to add something else. When you leave home, you will be on your own. And you will make your own decisions. You will not be bound by him always. But while you are bound by them, learn from them." And I never forgot it. And it helped greatly, because you see, his standard was excellence. And the thing that hurt me most was I never could seem to meet it--ever.
Periodically, we had a big dining room table. We lived in a big old country house, twelve or thirteen rooms.
ED: I'll bet the dining room table was round.
AH: A round table, and a good big one. For it had to seat seven, eight people. He had a habit--you did your homework in those days, and in his household believe me, so that we knew after dinner, seven-thirty, was homework time. And that meant seven-thirty to nine o'clock. Every once in awhile he'd decide to listen to our lessons, as they called them then, listen to our lessons. And "one night, just something about the way he glanced at me made me decide he was going to call on me, and I decided that for once in my life I would beat him. So I learned the ten pages that was my assignment by heart (I had a good memory) and proudly prepared to put him in his place at last. He said, "Anna, how about your work tonight. What is it?" And I said, "Ten pages of history." "Interesting. Hand me the text." So I handed it to him very proudly, he looked at,opened it up, looked at the cover: "Who is the author of this text, Anna?"﻿Page 16
Well I was so flabbergasted I said, "Well this is the school text, the superintendent picks these books." He said, "I didn't ask you who picks these books. I asked you who the author was." Well, by this time my ten pages, you see, I could see going out the window. So I said, "Well I've learned the ten pages that we were assigned." He said, "Do you mean to tell me that you'ye learned ten pages from a book whose author you don't know? An author whom you know nothing about? I can't believe it," and handed me back the book.
ED: Your opportunity to be excellent was...
AH: Not opportunity, demand.
ED: No, but I mean that chance that you thought you were going to have.
AH: Yes, oh yes.
ED: But you learned a greater lesson.
AH: That's what my mother kept saying to me, you see. "He insists on something that will bother you, but they will help you. And when they don't, you will discover it as you live your life, and you will make the necessary changes," which was just fantastically helpful.
My grandfather, you asked about his color, my grandfather was "Exhibit A" on our back porch. When I was born, Mother had at that time a German girl working for her. We didn't talk about maids out there, you got someone to come in to help as you needed it. And this German girl had been working for her for some time, Anna Criseelis, and I still don't know how to spell Criseelis, but there's something about the word that attracted me. She had a baby at the same time Mother had me, and the two women were sitting in our parlor with their babies in their laps when this friend came in. And looking at the two babies, and both of them, said, "Oh, you two have exchanged babies." Her baby was quite brown, and I, at that early stage, was fair with blue eyes. [laughter] They both had to laugh, and then they explained, "No, these are our babies." So Mother said--he said, "Well how do you," looking at my mother with her lovely brown eyes, "well, how did you get a blue-eyed baby?" She said, "Come, meet the child's grandfather." She'd take him out to the porch to meet my grandfather with his big, blue eyes. [laughter]
Of course this was a part of the whole thing that the South is. I said to a group in Florida, during the sixties, it was an integrated audience; it was maybe twenty-five of us and the rest white, several hundred. "You people have to learn to appreciate each other and work together, because you are all related, whether you know it or not. And you see for a long time we were ashamed to admit that, because of the slavery. And they were ashamed because of all that they had done to us. And nobody wanted to face the fantastic mixtures which came out of that slave situation.
ED: But you gave it the positive approach.
AH: Yes, right, and that's something we must do always I think.﻿Page 17
ED: Ann, would you tell us how you happened to choose the college that you chose, and which it was.
AH: Oh, that's a good question. You know, in these days young people shop around for the colleges they want to attend. Well, we had no such choice. My father planned our college experience, and he chose for me Hamline University at St. Paul, Minnesota. A good, Methodist college, a college with an excellent academic rating and a place where he had a friend on the board of trustees, and of course he knew many people around the state who'd been connected with the college. So Hamline University was selected for me.
He said that the University of Minnesota, which was right in Minneapolis and nearer home, was really too big for me at that time. I didn't know quite what that meant because I was interested in all the bigness I could find. But later I realized how wise. You see, I would have been lost on a college campus with twenty-five or thirty-thousand students.
ED: What size was Hamline? H-A-M-L-I-N-E?
AH: H-A-M-L-I-N-E, named for a bishop of the Methodist church.
ED: And how large a school was it?
AH: Oh, we were what, at that time... I suppose maybe 500. It's about 2000 now, it's grown tremendously, but it was about 500. And the oldest school of higher education.
ED: The oldest school in the state?
AH: It began first in Red Wing, and then moved into St. Paul.
ED: Did you meet African American students there?
AH: None.
ED: Again you were not near any of them..
AH: I told you, from the first grade in school through college... The only other student was my sister who came, for a short period, but she transferred to the University of Minnesota. She came for a short period, and she was too blonde to be useful, if you know what I mean.
ED: Did this do anything to your thinking, Ann, that you're aware of in terms of the lack of knowledge or acquaintance at that time with African American young people?
AH: No, I had met the young people in St. Paul. And when social events came I was invited to everything, and I went where I could. I had some real problems, however, because we had never been allowed to dance. It was simply not... I was trying to think of a word that really would describe it... It was sinful. We were not permitted to dance, and I had my first shock at Hamline when we had a party in the evening in the dormitory: the girls, as we arrived, and they were dancing. So I decided that that must be because white people﻿Page 18
just don't have the same high standards, except that I met another girl who was as upset as I was, Mary Poston, from Thief River Falls, Minnesota, who became my buddy. And we went upstairs and cried our hearts out. We had met when she registered, I registered ahead of her by chance in line, and I helped her register. And from then on, for the four years, we were the closest of friends. And here we were, attending this first party on a Christian college campus, and they were dancing.
ED: Boys and girls dancing.
AH: No, this was girls.
ED: All girls dancing.
AH: All girls, because it was in the dormitory.
ED: Did your father--I think you told me once before when we talked--did your father in his talking with you--around the family circle, did he tell you about African American history? Did you know, what did you know about black people?
AH: I'm glad you asked that because he taught me that Africa was the
oldest continent. They had rich civilization there before the rest of the world really got started. And that was for me enough. The Norwegians talk about Norway in pretty much the same kinds of terms, they were very important people, and all the rest of the people did.
ED: So you felt secure in your origins in that respect.
AH: In my origins from Africa. Now here he did indicate color
prejudice, and he suffered a little bit of it here and there. I found out an interesting thing. My sisters and brothers met some of it in different ways from the way I met it, and I'm not sure that I just wasn't perceptive enough to see some of it.
ED: But the family as a whole was not a brown family, was it?
AH: We ran from brown to fair, from black eyes to blue eyes. One brother has very dark eyes.
ED: Was there any period in which any of >you were not aware that you were the only African American family in the town?
AH: Oh no, we all knew it.
ED: Did you feel good about it, or just, or it didn't come up?
AH: Well, we thought we were very special people. We were Arnolds, and being Arnold meant something. And we were expected to set standards and not to be influenced by anything that went on around us. So it gave you a sense of your own superiority, and my father helped run anything he met. He was on the board of trustees for the church...
ED: He didn't run into any discrimination when he started, did he?
AH: Oh sure, you always do. But...﻿Page 19
ED: He overcame it, or what was it, it was just his force...?
AH: He moved on with his ideas, and...
ED: Was he ever put out of anything because of his race?
AH: He must have been, but I don't know it. I remember once that he had a tremendous idea which involved chambers of commerce--which he'd worked with before—chambers of commerce, college presidents, leading representatives of the legislature in the state and all that. A special project, which I know now from a conversation I overheard that he had been robbed of it.
ED: That position.
AH: That was the only time--not position, of his idea. And it was used differently. I don't know beyond that. I've often thought that as he met a situation and handled it that was it. I never heard him complain about anything at all.
ED: So the experience of being the only African American family in that town never became a situation where you were in any way discriminated against, or not included.
AH: You can't say that, because life is so subtle, anywhere, that you cannot be sure that all kinds of things didn't happen that you didn't even know about.
ED: But at least you weren't aware of it, as a child.
AH: I have a very interesting quote from a friend of ours the
granddaughter of people I knew well in Anoka. She happened to be a reporter for a Minneapolis paper, and in writing about my first book, The Trumpet Sounds, she commented on the discriminatory things that I mentioned. And then said...
ED: That occurred later in life.
AH: Yeah. And then mentioned—and then said that all she remembered was the talent, that she thought of us as the most talented young people in the town. That sort of comment.
Now, there were little episodes, but you see, my father taught me that anyone who discriminated against me because of color was not intelligent. And you can play that game all the way through schooling. For instance I had one, my first incident, lives with me to this day. There was a little girl, perhaps five years old, who every afternoon would run to me even as I came to school. And I would pick her up in my arms and hug her. One day, she looked at me and kind of pulled back, as I took her up in my arms, and she said, "Are you really a Nigger?" and I knew instantly that somebody had said it, so I said, "Did your mother tell you that?" She said, "Yes." I said, "Where's your mother?" I went with her to her mother, and I asked her whether or not she had said this to Isabel. And she looked me dead in the eye and said "No," and turned to the﻿Page 20
child and said, "Where did you get that!" and spanked her in my presence.
ED: So. You found out it didn't come from home.
AH: It did come. I'm so sure it came from home. I didn't know what to do, 'cause I got...
ED:	Would she run and jump into your arms after that?
AH:	But you see she... No, not again.
ED:	That was the point.
AH:	Yes. Not again.
ED:	And that was really your first experience, wasn't it?
AH: My very first experience. And that hurt so badly. I talked to my father about "Nigger", and he explained to me that people called each other all kinds of names. In our town, for instance, Swedes and Germans and Irish and all of them had particular nicknames. And Italians. One Jewish family. All of them had little nicknames, and he said, "People do this to each other."
ED: So he didn't allow you to have feelings about it, he put it...
AH: No, he couldn't prevent that, but he did say that this is not an unusual experience. You are more likely to have it directly than the other children because there are people... He used to say that we had special responsibilities because we had greater experience.
ED: Wonderful way of saying it, wasn't it. Was your mother's influence as strong on you as your father's?
AH: Stronger.
ED: In what ways?
AH: She was so aware of what he was doing, and thinking, and becoming,
and also aware of our needs, and handled it all with such skill that I've always thought that, perhaps of the two, she was the more intelligent. It's a very difficult thing for me to say, for I really have, to this day, the greatest admiration for my father, for his intellect, for his willingness to give everything he had for the broad things in which he believed, for his deep concern in his family. But I think there was a broader sensitivity in her. I don't think many women could have understood him as well as she did.
ED: So that she understood him so well that it wasn't necessary for her to even think about being dominated, she knew in her own mind her own strength.
AH: Oh, but she knew, as all women did at that time, that man was the head of the household. It was a very simple kind of expectancy of the men. In fact women nurtured it. It was fascinating that when my father was away, he always called by telephone to see how﻿Page 21
everything was. And she would tell him what she thought was urgent to tell him, and the rest she would keep until he came home. And I knew that, from the little things that she said to me. But women generally thought of men as the expected major strength. And when Father was away we all missed him for that, although she had her own strength. But when he crossed the threshold we knew everything was all right. That in the final analysis, if it was urgent, she would certainly go to him. And he'd solve it.
ED: But if he wasn't there, she could solve it herself.
AH: When he was there she participated in the solution. When he wasn't there, and it was necessary to make a decision, she did it.
ED: Do you think it was a good partnership then?
AH: As good as partnerships in that time could be.
ED: Where would your mother be now today with the new ideas of, with the ideas of liberated women?
AH: You see, I don't think there's much being done about liberated women. I think we've set out what we've accepted, and this she never would have done. We have accepted that pattern which men have developed, and tried to get into it, and concentrated in trying to get into it. Rather than taking the time to analyze it and see what part of it was good for our men, and what part of it was not; what part of it was good for life, and what was not. And building a liberation program which should be thought of in terms of both men and women.
ED: Not into compartments.
AH: Not, yes. We've set up a whole new competition. And that's been difficult. I was one of the original--I don't like to say organizers because it wasn't, it's never been that organized--one of the original members of NOW, the National Organization for Women, and participated in a founding convention. But immediately knew that they were going down that same old path. And that this could free neither men nor women. And this was not the time when persons were listening to it. And I knew this, you see, because of what I call my black experience.
ED: You came to that through your black experience, we're still now having you in college, aren't we?
AH: Oh yes, I have to finish college.
ED: When you finished college you then...
AH: Well, first, before that, let me say quickly that the college campus was an invigorating continuation of my home. Not that they knew it. It was a college where education was built on North Europe, just as all education practically in this country has been built. So I came .out of that, very thrilled with a variety of professors. I had good teachers in high school; I can still remember their names; I can see them walking across a room. I remember the principal of the high﻿Page 22
school and the professors in college who were particularly effective. One of them I could never write anything about myself without mentioning, was Thomas Percival Beyer.
ED: Teacher of?
AH: Professor of English. And the kind of perceptive person who looked at the social scene in England. I'm as at home in London as I am in New York, because I lived with London, lived with England out of that kind of experience. But more than that he had the inquiring mind and the concern about all kinds of things that...
ED: So college was a very creative, exciting experience.
AH: Creative, exciting, frightening because they did dance, and they did socialize more than I... My father used to say "If a man can't entertain a woman properly he ought to take to his heels."
ED: Well you went on through college keeping these ideas that came from home?
AH: Yes, because there were enough other people who moved along the same vein so that it was not too difficult, really...
ED: So college was not a very social experience for you.
AH: Oh yes, I went to all the affairs and participated, I simply didn't dance.
ED: I see. And this was the...
AH: I even went to the dances the young people in St. Paul had.
ED: But didn't dance.
AH: Didn't dance. And the boys would come, we used to have little
cards, you know, where you sign up for dances, that was an awfully nice idea. And the boys would sign-up for what they called a "sit-out" with me. And for the duration of the particular dance we'd talk. So I had a very exciting time; there were several of the fellows who were interesting to know and who appreciated my concerns, which really were around ideas and books and all the rest. And there were several fellows who were especially thoughtful about it, and would occasionally send me poems and all that business, or would come prepared to talk to me at the dance, bringing something they wanted me to see.
ED: The intellectual friends.
AH: No, it was much simpler than that.
ED: Basically though you had an intellectual pursuit.
AH: I suppose. I had a great time.
ED: Then you graduated, still being the only African American at Hamline College.﻿Page 23
AH: Hamline University.
ED: Hamline, pardon me, Hamline University. And did they have any speakers that came on campus, did you meet any African American persons as speakers?
AH: Not one the whole time I was there. I had a Spanish professor,
however, who was--she was a German woman, German background--no it wasn't German either. But my Spanish professor, and I can't recall her name this minute, I'm sorry, announced that an outstanding (using their terms again) Negro leader was coming to St. Paul, Minnesota, to speak, and she advised that we all hear him. Well, first of all I couldn't figure out what a Negro leader was, and why, but I decided I'd better go because if white students went I wanted to be prepared to comment, where it was necessary. And so I went to the big church where he spoke, and guess who it was?
ED: I am very anxious to know.
AH: William E. Burghardt DuBois.
ED: Did this do anything to you?
AH: He had just come from the Pan-African Conference in Paris. You know how elegant he was. Not so tall, so that he probably had to act more commanding than he really was, but he did have a kind of carriage which I believe one could call honestly, arrogance. He walked on that stage in dress clothes. Now, we didn't use dress clothes so much out there, oh, for formal affairs once in awhile, but in general, a business suit was it. Here he was in full dress, looking as though he'd been born in tails.
And his speech was beautiful. Of course his use of language... I love English and learned it carefully, and my father was a great speaker, and I've still never heard anyone who could beat him. And so this was fascinating. And he talked about the great leaders of Africa. Now this tied right in with my father's suggestion that leadership, and diamonds and gold and products and all the rest had come out of Africa; the world had built itself on Africa.
So here was DuBois, practically saying the same thing in his eloquent fashion. I came away deeply stirred, couldn't wait to get to class the next morning where his presentation was discussed. But it wasn't discussed in depth. And when I looked, went to the library, I found nothing of his. And then in the whole process of my educational experience I forgot--I forgot in the sense of not following through. I never forgot him and his presentation.
ED: It was a very singular moment;
AH: It was a very singular moment, and one that years later stood out even more in my memory. There were, in my thought, also other people who are great people.
ED: But that was the only African American.﻿Page 24
AH: Speaker that we ever had.
ED: Now when you graduated, what happened? I know this story, you've told me, so I want you to share it.
AH: I decided I wanted to teach. I didn't know that I couldn't get a teaching opportunity in Minnesota. I didn't understand...
ED: Because you were African...
AH: Because of color! I didn't know that my having been chosen to teach English to freshmen college students at Hamline was because the local high schools wouldn't let me do practice teaching in them. I didn't know any of them.
ED: Was it covert or open?
AH: No, they didn't discuss it.
ED: But, I mean, they knew it. They made this opportunity available for you at the college, so in a sense that was keeping you from finding out, wasn't that?
AH: That was keeping me from suffering, they would have said. Yes, which is again--
ED:	Kindly, they thought.
AH:	Yes. They had no way of meeting the reality either. So there you were.
ED:■ Yes. So you taught the college students.
AH:	I wish then that they had said to me what had happened.
ED:	When did you find out?
AH:	When I came back from Mississippi.
ED:	I see, well, we haven't gotten to Mississippi.
AH:	We haven't gotten to Mississippi yet.
ED:	So you wanted to teach.
AH:	Yes.
ED:	And this was when you found out.
AH:	I knew I could teach.
ED:	And you found out that you couldn't teach in the Minnesota schools.
AH: No, I didn't find out then. I said to Dr. Frank Doran, Dr. Doran was my father's friend, a member of the board of trustees at Hamline, and I lived in their home. I don't know now whether I could have stayed in the dormitory at that time. But I lived in﻿Page 25
their home, in their daughter's room, she had married and moved out. And this was perfectly comfortable. My father simply said that he thought I would be happy in their home, and I never thought about it beyond that.
ED: You said to him, Mr. Doran...
AH: I said to Dr. Doran, "I want to teach." He asked me, "What do you want to do when you finish in June?" I said, "I want to teach." And he said, "Where?" I said, "The South." Now I wanted to go South because of my father's stories of the culture of the South, because his classmates had been outstanding people. Three of them had become college presidents, another had been an outstanding scientist and historian, another a mathematician, etcetera. And I wanted to see what special quality there was there that he didn't find in my beloved West, and I still love the West. He didn't find it there, and I wanted to know why. And he didn't find it in spite of the fact that he had taken for himself every major opportunity that he wanted. So this is what was puzzling me. And I decided, and also I wanted to see why he was as strict as he was. You didn't read the funny papers on Sunday, you didn't dance.
ED: You didn't sew in our home.
AH: Well, no, or do anything that was work on Sunday, that was the Lord's Day.
ED: We couldn't even sew.
AH: No, nothing. That was the Lord's Day. You even planned your meals so that you had a minimum of work to do, of any kind, on Sunday. You went to church... When my father got a car he took us for a ride occasionally on Sunday. And he would drive very slowly and show us the beauties of the countryside to sort of forgive himself for riding on Sunday. And we used to make him so angry because we'd say, "Wish we could get out and push the car." And it was really fun.
ED: So Anna, you wanted to teach in the South.
AH: I wanted to teach in the South.
ED: So you did not have to confront the problem of not being able to teach in the North.
AH: I didn't know I couldn't yet. I didn't dream it. In fact, I thought the world was expecting me because now I was educated.
ED: So how did you get to the South?
AH: Through this Dr. Doran. I told him. And he was very high in
Methodist circles, so he got in touch with the education department. And the director then was I. Garland Penn, do you know that name?
ED: Certainly...﻿Page 26
AH: One of the earliest African American educators. And I. Garland Penn had several invitations sent me for teaching posts. I thought it was because I was good and the University had sent word that I was good. Instead of that it was influence. It was my first contact with influence, and I didn't even know that until years later. I just accepted these offers and studied them, and picked the one furthest South, Mississippi. And remember, this is sixty years ago.
ED: This is 1920 . . .
AH: It was 1920...
ED: Nineteen twenty-two, when they were lynching black people in Mississippi.
AH: Yes, and had been for centuries and have in a very real sense continued. But I didn't know all this.
ED: You wanted to go South.
AH: I wanted to go South. Then I arranged to leave, and the school was opening on Monday, the'fifteenth of September. I never will forget it. So I persuaded my mother that I had to go a couple of days early because I wanted to see a bit of Chicago. This was not in my father's plans, but I worked out my transportation before he got home, and with my mother's help got all packed. He bought me my first trunk, with my initials on it, and I had a pretty little blue dress with a white collar that was my travelling costume. It fitted perfectly my Puritan background, if you know what I mean. And arranged for my cousins in Chicago to meet me--my mother's cousins lived there. And he had formerly lived in St. Paul so that, and was the first of us to graduate from the University of Minnesota, so that it was a whole family connection there, which was good. They were to meet me. I was to leave Minnesota on Wednesday, leave Chicago on Thursday night in order to be in--no, Friday night, I had one day in Chicago, Friday night in order to be in Mississippi on Saturday. So that I wouldn't arrive at a Christian college having travelled on Sunday, do you hear me?
ED: Yes, yes.
AH: I got it all set up and agreed to do it that way. And then when I got to Chicago, my cousins said to me--from their experience on an African American college campus of the South--said, "You don't need to get there before the fifteenth because there'll be nobody there. Students are in the cotton fields. They're part of the share-cropping situation, and they will not get in on time. In fact, you will be receiving students all the way up to December. You'll be down there long enough." See, they knew what it was all about, "you'll be down there long enough; dort't go before Sunday night." So I made my first big independent decision. I made the mistake of calling home Sunday night, this is before I left. And of course my father was there.
ED: And wanted to know why you weren't in Mississippi, right?﻿Page 27
AH: That's right. And I explained that my cousins suggested that I go Sunday, that Monday would be plenty of time to arrive. He didn't say anything then. When I came back in June, he proceeded to inform me that he'd had some questions about trusting me, for we had made a plan which I had violated, okay? Well, of course, by this time I was ready and understood a good deal of what he had done and why, and didn't in any way express my annoyance. I had a wonderful time in Chicago. The Loop, Tivoli Theatre was new...
ED: First time in Chicago?
AH: Oh yes, you didn't travel. We didn't have money for travel.
Furthermore, you didn't need vacations. That wasn't what life was about. You could get rest when you needed it. But work was what life was about. So, the trips...
ED: So, you had a good time in Chicago.
AH: A lot of my friends made trips, and some of them couldn't pass,
wouldn't let 'em go. They'd give the porter on the train money to mail cards from them from Chicago so that they got a reputation of having been in the big city. So arriving in Chicago was a very big moment for me. And I went to the Tivoli.
ED: And you were staying with your relatives?
AH: I stayed with my cousins. Bernice and Frederick Parker.
ED: And did you do things?
AH: They took me to the Tivoli, which was a theater near--and brand new at the time and very beautiful, and the largest theatre I had seen of that kind--and they took me downtown, and we went to Field's...
ED: Marshall Field's.
AH: Marshall Field's department store and shopped for china. We weren't able to buy any, we just wanted to look at it. And Spode was her real love, and so we looked at all of the Spode we could find. And lately there's been an ad on for Spode, now you kept thinking of her...
ED: Coming from my store.
AH: That's right. And I kept the Christmas tree bit. And I kept
thinking of that little trip. And then on Sunday night I discovered that I had two choices. I could either go South by way of the straight Jim Crow train out of Chicago, or change in Cairo, Illinois. And I decided to change. I was so glad I did because I was in a very comfortable coach, and the change made me know that difference right away. That what they called the "colored coach" was dirty; it was just up behind the engine. People were piling on with baskets of food and crying babies. And the food annoyed me very much. You just didn't eat on the train, in public, you know, and you...﻿Page 28
ED: This was a very full, dramatic experience for a woman raised with the sheltering that you had.
AH: I was annoyed with these colored people carrying food on the train
and eating half the night, and babies sleeping on the side... And I thought that they were just poor and unable to take a bed, and that worried me. But I decided that I had to have a good breakfast. I'd had breakfast on the train from St. Paul to Chicago, you see. So the conductor looked at me, I asked him where was the diner. And he said, looking me up and down, "Niggers don't use the diner." Then I knew why the baskets. And at that moment, a whole new vista of things appeared. And then up and down the countryside, little toilets, colored/white, colored/white. And I didn't know that this was the pattern of the United States, then. I only thought it was this horrible South into which I was going. I got off the train in Holly Springs, Mississippi.
ED:	Was it straight through from Cairo to Holly Springs?
AH:	Well, straight through, yes.
ED:	You didn't have to get off before.
AH:	I didn't get off. I was too scared by this time.
ED:	It stopped but you stayed on.
AH:	It stopped at stations along, but I was too frightened.
ED: Of course you were. What did you do? Were you actually put in a seat by yourself?
AH: We actually went into Jackson, Mississippi, and then came from
Jackson to Holly Springs. So that Jackson was the non-stop part of it.
ED: Now sitting in this car was this absolutely different experience that you were having for the first time. We've heard your background on this tape and realized how you grew up, the only African American person in your elementary/high school, we've heard all this. On this car, can you draw a picture for us? Where did you sit?
AH: First...
ED: Did you sit in a corner? AH: No, I sat in a regular seat. ED: Was anybody beside you?
AH: Not at first. I don't know why that was now, I couldn't tell you because I don't remember that much about that. But what disturbed me was the food, eating food that way in public.
ED:
Which we can understand because of the way you were brought up.﻿Page 29
AH: And we were taught not to.
ED: Of course. Did you talk to anybody, did you relate to any of these people?
AH: I looked them over. No, I was used to being introduced to people, you see. I had not had the experience.
ED: Yes, sure, this was the lady.
AH: Yes, right. So a man came...
ED: So you rode down in silence?
AH: I rode part of the way in silence. A man spoke to me at one point, and I wondered where I'd met him, and I couldn't think that I had. And then, women with children, I love children, my mother taught me to love children, really, she used to let me make little baggage for them with her. And let me take care of them. I just adored kids. And therefore I did sort of play with children as it was practical, but, I couldn't understand the mothers and fathers and all of them on, they were so friendly with each other I thought they must come from the same town. They didn't. I wasn't used to the Southern hospitality bit which you finally come to. One man, I think disgusted because I hadn't spoken, said, "Lady, I think you ought to get off at this stop. There's an insane asylum down the road and I think you b'long there." And I suppose it was just because I didn't talk and fraternize as I later learned to do.
ED: Were you scared?
AH: Awfully scared.
ED: You must have been.
AH: Awfully scared, because these were strangers, I knew nothing about them.
ED: Probably a different way of life. So you arrived in Jackson, you still didn't get off.
AH:	Got changed in Jackson.
ED:	Oh, you changed.
AH:	Changed trains in Jackson.
ED:	And went to Holly.
AH:	Got on the train to Holly Springs.
ED:	And what time of day did you arrive in Holly Springs?
AH:	Arrived in the morning.
ED:	Oh, good.﻿Page 30
AH: Well, luckily. Two taxi cabs in the colored/white space. And I didn't think about the "colored/white" at that moment, I only saw the most attractive cab, and went over to it. And it was said, "Niggers can't ride in this cab," and pointed me to the other one. Then I rode to the school, up the corduroy roads, roads with the deep ruts, into the college campus. And the campus is a large one. The administration building is standing at the top of a hill, a big, red building. But it was fall, September, and the grass had been burned up by the heat, so you came up to this building with a sense of barrenness that parched grass can give you sometimes. The matron met me at the door, and she was not my idea of the person who should be greeting college teachers. She was huge and very crisp about her sense of direction. "Have you had food?" "No, I haven't." By that time I was starved.
ED: Because you didn't eat all the way, did you?
AH: No.
ED: People offered you food.
AH: Oh, I did'eat. A butcher boy came through, you know, they used to have the boys who'd come through with food. So I got sandwiches, and they were dry as dust.
ED: Well, I'm sure some of the passengers on the train offered you food but you said, "No, thank you."
AH: No, you see I was much too isolated in my whole attitude. And I
presume now that they saw me complete with hat and gloves and all of the trappings and assumed that I was one of those "North'n gals," 'cause they don't like Northerners nohow. And certainly not Northern African Americans. They think of you as perhaps putting on airs, you know, that is, the ordinary run of the mill, I don't mean the leadership.
ED: Right, yes, we get the whole picture. So you were hungry.
AH: And I was hungry.
ED: What was the name of the college? We haven't identified it.
AH: Rust College, a Methodist college,	Holly Springs, Mississippi, a
town of about five thousand or so,	I guess, with a great rural
population and the main street...	Courthouse on the main street and the stores all around it.
ED: And this was 1922, and you were twenty-three years old.
AH: That's right.
ED: First visit South.
AH: They gave me my breakfast. I'd never seen fatback before. And I'd never seen biscuits that weren't beautifully brown and done. So I had this fatback and these ugly biscuits for my approval, given me by the woman who had charge of the dining room. And she was a tough﻿Page 31
cookie. It's the only way to describe her. Sharp, abrupt, no foolishness, sure that you were going to understand her authority. And I really took a little time to get acquainted with her. That worked out pretty well, she brought me my breakfast, and I had sense enough not to complain about it. The coffee was undrinkable. I had sense enough not to complain, but to swallow what I could of it, 'cause I really was hungry. And then the matron came and took me to my room, which was a small room, typical of many schools, but nothing attractive about it at all. And there I was.
Faculty meeting was due that night. And I went to the faculty meeting and was fascinated with the people and with the dean. The dean was--James Farmer of CORE, and he was in the whole freedom movement--it was his father, Dr. Leonard Farmer. His father was the dean, graduate of either Harvard or Yale, I always have to check that out, but an eastern college. A brilliant man. And very thoughtful about all of us. I was introduced as having all these contacts. That's the last thing you do to a Northerner in the South. But he was attempting to give me status. And this had to be done somehow, and all he had to offer was what I'd done, and the connections I had. It took me about three months to live that down. But the teachers were fantastic.
ED: This was an interracial faculty, wasn't it?
AH: The only interracial people left--as you remember there came the
surge, and the demand that our teachers and principals be employed.
ED: In 1922, this demand was made?
AH: Oh yes, yes.
ED: This was after World War I?
AH: Yeah, and some of it had happened even before that. Because as we graduated people, the only place they could work was across the South.
ED: The colleges therefore were having faculties larger, proportionately...
AH: Not necessarily.
ED: Was this one equal, you know, half-and-half, or more black?
AH: Oh no, they didn't have any whites in teaching.
ED: Oh, so it was primarily...
AH: So they moved, most of them were moved during this transition
period, when we had prepared people and the North wasn't about to accept them. And the Southern Negro colleges was the only place open, with a few exceptions.
ED: So your faculty was primarily African American?﻿Page 32
AH: Really totally. They had kept two white women who had charge of one of the residences. It's interesting too, I don't remember their names but we called them "Beck" and "Barb." They were very good, solid women. And then they had a sewing teacher whom we called "Miss Cottontail," the students called "Miss Cottontail" because she was such an ordinary white woman. And the two, Beck and Barb they respected because they were gentlewomen, and the South of course was very conservative and the so-called Negro South was more conservative than the white community. And that's something people have never understood. We've always been more conservative because we had to struggle so to have some little something to conserve; people don't understand that. And those were the three whites. And they were not really in the faculty, you see.
ED: Right. You were plunged into a black world, from a white world into...
AH: Right, except that, yes, in a very real sense because I'd had the church contact in St. Paul.
ED: In St. Paul?
AH: Yes.
ED: Which you didn't go to very often.
AH: It was St. James A.M.E. Church. I went whenever I could manage it because all the students were there, the young people that I wanted to see and know. And there was another church there, Pilgrim Baptist Church, so I went to both the Baptist and the Methodist churches.
ED: This was while you were in college.
AH: Yes.
ED: So that gave you some knowledge of the African American world.
AH: That gave me very real knowledge. In fact, when I went to St. James A.M.E Church on that famous Sunday morning, Easter Sunday morning, the choir was beautiful. Roy was in the choir, for instance.
ED: Roy Wilkins.
AH: And so were two or three other people. I use Roy's name because
everybody knows him; anyway, he was in the choir. And, the service was often interrupted with "Amen." And I'd never heard of making noise in church, I was very upset. And finally, in the back of the church, a voice said "Preach it, master." Oh, I almost died. My aunt grabbed me by the arm and said, "Don't look around, don't say anything. I'll tell you about this later."
ED: This is interesting.
AH: So I had seen the numbers... Later I came to know him, he was the most delightful old man you'd ever want to know, a man by the name of Livingston, I never forgot him.﻿Page 33
ED: So when you're plunged into the South now... We'd had a little
introduction before, which we hadn't identified in this tape. So this is very important because we're thinking of you going from a very white world into a black without anything in between.
AH: But the thing in between, remember...
ED: Was this church experience.
AH: These two church experiences, but these were the old friends of my mother's, and the sons and daughters of them. And one of my problems with it, I couldn't see why there was so much difference made, because they were all behaving the same way. They were having their debut parties, they were having their dances, and they were having their general graduations from this school or that school. So that I couldn't figure out what the difference really was. And in color they varied, some of the most remarkable combinations of color you ever saw.
ED: So in that sense, this arrival at Rust College in Holly Springs, Mississippi, was a totally new experience.
AH: It was a totally new experience because here you were dealing with the rural South, actually, with the sons and daughters of the rural South. Now there were some from larger cities. No campus is all one thing or the other, but the primary numbers came out of the rural South.
ED: So what we're anxious to ask you is how did you make out with the young people. What were the first three or four months like?
AH: They were months of discovering the meaning of the countryside, of where these students came from and what they were expecting, I soon discovered that they expected more than I had. This was a real challenge. They wanted to know everything that they could know. And they besieged me for information. My schedule ran from--the breakfast was usually about seven in the morning, then we had study hall at night. There was no business of sending students to their rooms to study, they studied in study hall for a given period, usually seven to nine, right after supper. And you worked with them as they needed work. A solid disciplinary experience. And the teachers had their regular meetings and reviewed problems and worked at them. The dean--I had some difficulties of adjustment because it was an isolated and lonely situation, and I had always dreamed of an enlarged one right after college, you know. One day I said to the young man who was most gracious to me, who was from Montana, and was very kind to me, and really liked me very much, he was a chemistry teacher, and I heard of the first vitamins through him: he was a chemistry teacher who had wanted very much to be a physician and had gone to Chicago Medical School, which was called Rust, I think at that time too. And hadn't been able to do it because of the finances. Well anyway, he knew what I was going through because of my background. So one day he said, "Why don't you go down to the station with me and watch the trains go North. You'll see so many people, it'll be interesting." So I did, and it was interesting and it relieved a little bit of the sense of isolation from the world.﻿Page 34
And we talked about their dreams as they went North. And I was so pleased because they would find it freer in the North; that's how ignorant I was.
Well then, another time, we had to chaperone the young people, and I couldn't understand this. It was a small town. Why did students have to be chaperoned if they were going shopping? I just thought it was ridiculous. But they required it. You also, as a teacher, were expected to wear formal clothes. I don't mean evening sense formal but formal schoolteacher dress. And I had a group of middy blouses that I had brought from home and that I liked very much. I wore one of them one day. And then...
ED: This is for a modern-day audience, particularly young people who won't even know what you mean. Tell them what a middy blouse is.
AH: Middy blouse is, the Navy middy blouse.
ED: Right. White, with the big collar.
AH: With the big collar. Blue, with a couple of stars in the back.
ED: Right. And a blue tie, and it came right straight down over the hips.
AH: Straight down over the hips, or at the waist if you wore a pleated skirt. You might want it to end at the waist and wear it inside, but either inside or out., usually out to the waist. I had a half a dozen of them, beautifully laundered, so why shouldn't I use them? The president's wife, on this one, took me aside and said, "Really, you ought to wear a shirt waist. Teachers don't wear blouses like this." Well, I was annoyed. Who was going to tell me how to dress? Then, another time, taking the students in town to be chaperoned for shopping trips, I didn't wear a hat. Because in the West we didn't wear hats as much. I had a dean of women who was from the South and who taught us to wear hat and gloves whenever we went into town. And we thought she was elegant enough so we did it, but we still thought it was a little silly because it was not a great big city. So I went into town without my hat, and I noticed that the students looked at me kind of strangely but I didn't realize what it was about. Got back to the campus; it was all over campus that I'd been into town without a hat. Well, by this time I'm completely fed up because they knew my father had supervised us, you see. So I was very upset, so I went to the president. Matthew S. Davage, very, very gracious man and a very frank man, and very sensible, really.
ED: He was the what?
AH: The president. Matthew S. Davage.
ED: Who was Mr. James Farmer?
AH: James Farmer was the dean. So I went to the president. I said, "Mr President? I am being criticized for a whole lot of things I don't understand, and I resent it very much." So I told him these things that I've just related to you. He threw back his head and laughed. He said, "You haven't done anything wrong. It's a matter of﻿Page 35
expediency in a peculiar situation." And then he described the fact that, for instance, they taught their students to wear hats to keep them from being approached by white men. They were identified then as college students with some power behind them. So that's why they insisted on their being groomed, so they could be identified as college young people.
And I later knew this was true, because there was a lawyer who would stand near his office, and literally, if you happened to catch his eye, wink at you just going down the street. Also, women often had problems of getting them to show them clothing. And certainly they could not try clothing on except in one store in the town. So that if you had any arguments, you needed a teacher properly groomed as they were, which was a whole new thing. And then he said on the subject of going to the railroad station, "I now understand why you went, but they would think of you as hanging around the railroad station." I said, "Well, that's exactly what they said, and I've never been to one before in my life for any purposes of seeing the station."
ED: All in the way it's viewed, isn't it?
AH: All of these little, tiny things that can make the difference.
ED: I can't resist this moment to say to those who are not looking at
you now, only hearing you, that to hear that you once didn't have a hat on is the opposite of the present day, because Anna Arnold Hedgeman of Harlem, U.S.A., is known as the lady who always has that little hat which you have on now, usually cocked on the side of your head.
AH: Always, that expresses my rebellion. Always I've kept it on the
side of my head. I don't care who produced it and how, it goes on the side, just the same.
ED: It's part of your rebellion.
AH: But it wasn't really, you know. It wasn't really a part of learning that in the South.
ED: No.
AH: That came as a result of talking to school kids in Harlem, and I
learned that they noticed what you wore. And the hat attracted. So I used to buy my hats literally from school children in New York City.
ED: And now it's just become a real mark of Anna Arnold Hedgeman, hasn't it?
AH: Then when the hatless fad came, I decided to keep it for two reasons. Your hair gets thinner. And you can't make it as attractive as you once did, on the one hand. And on the other, I was sure that they would have to come back, and I decided to help lead them back. And the third thing was that it gives you your" individuality, which is so hard to capture in this culture.﻿Page 36
ED: Right. Well, it certainly does, because we know when you walk in the back of a room, "There's Anna! There's Dr. Hedgeman with her hat on." We're going to pause a moment.
Could you share with us at this point a little bit more about the experience in Mississippi. How long did you stay at the school?
AH: I stayed two years, primarily because I wanted to be sure that I
could stand it. And some of the teachers thought maybe I couldn't take a second year, but I decided I wanted to see as much as I could of that part of the South while I was there. I had a chance to go into Memphis, for instance, which was the largest Southern city near, and get a glimpse of that kind of community, and meet some of the leaders there and discover that the businessmen and some of the doctors and lawyers kept their wives off streetcars because of segregation. There was a big sign in the middle of the streetcar: "White people move forward. Safety first." And they didn't want their wives to face this sort of thing, so they had lovely cars, and they teamed up and kept their wives off the streetcars.
I discovered the sharecropper and the world of the sharecropper, the way in which they really raised the crops but were expected to receive only their share of the crops, according to the contract. Usually it was a third of them. The store where they bought their supplies, and they were allowed credit, and they had no way of being sure about the amount of credit they had received. And helped in the cotton fields; in fact they were late coming to school because they had to harvest the crop. And early leaving, just when I thought maybe I was teaching something important, they had to leave to plant and so they were a continuous part of the agricultural situation in the South. And the teachers had to plan accordingly to try to give them as much as they could in the term, in the time they were on campus.
ED: A teacher in those days was a completely dedicated person, was he or she not?
AH: That, and they had almost no choice. In that little town there was not a library that African Americans could use. In that little town there were very few places where you could be sure to get the magazines you wanted. In fact teachers brought their own magazines from home and books from home. There was no library. The library was, so-called, was filled with Methodist disciplines, which are the orders of the church.
ED: The school library.
AH: The school library. In fact it took forty years; I helped break
ground for the library. It was a few years ago with Leontyne Price, whose mother was a graduate of Rust. It's just that horrible to think of, that all that time teachers had to supply everything.
ED: Teachers had to be everything to their students, didn't they?
AH: Absolutely.﻿Page 37
ED: And you worked from seven o'clock to nine o'clock. Your whole life was these young people that were entrusted to you.
AH: And there was very little in the community for you for refreshment
of any kind. You didn't have theatre, no library, not many friends; and teachers were expected to be on campus and available to students, and women particularly. Men could go and come as they pleased, but women were expected to be in at night.
ED: Did you have any social life as a teacher?
AH: No, we didn't. Occasionally we'd have a little party among
ourselves but you'd worked together all day long and you really...
ED: So the faculty was your only...
AH: Only recourse. And of course they had to have, you had to plan for maybe a dinner occasionally, or an evening occasionally. And about once a year the president and his wife would have you for a formal reception in their home.
ED: Did you think of it as a dreary life?
AH: No, it wasn't dreary for the simple reason that I was so completely involved in studying the students, in developing my own teaching skills, of figuring out what more I needed to know in order to be really effective with them.
ED: So you were really racked-up, as the expression goes, in your job. In other words, it was your whole life, wasn't it?
AH: It was my, practically my whole life. Now when I did want the
change, I told you about going to the station one night just to see some people who were not involved in my life.
ED: I understand what you mean when you didn't lament this too much because you were consumed.
AH: Now there was some leading citizens in town who would invite us out to dinner, occasionally. There was a very outstanding family, the McKissicks. Dr. McKissick was a very comfortably fixed, they said he was wealthy, I don't know what wealth meant really. But he had this beautiful Southern home, and their table would simply groan with food, and they tried to bring everything to that table that they thought, they knew you were missing on the campus. So we all delighted in having visits with people like that who were the prominent citizens. But that could come only so often, and most of the time...
ED: And you didn't pine for it, I guess, did you, because you were so...
AH: I was so involved.
ED: Involved with your students. Did you enjoy the teaching?
AH: Oh, I love to teach. I loved it.﻿Page 38
ED: Did you enjoy the students?
AH: Yes, very much. They were very responsive.
ED: They were eager, weren1t they?
AH: You talk about formality--they, even for the younger students they used Mr. and Mrs. And I didn't understand at the time. It was because in the South nobody let you be Mr. or Mrs. That's why I laugh at my women's lib crowd, they use Ms. Not for me. Because that was the only thing they'd call you and it meant simply that you were a non-person really. If you were real old they might call you Miz if they couldn't get away with Auntie, you see?
ED: Most Southerners, you find, have this reaction.
AH: My first paycheck, the bank clerk called me by my first name. And.I learned the old trick of using only initials in the South. Because they used your...
ED: To keep from being called by...
AH: To keep from being called by your first name.
ED: What did this whole two years in Mississippi mean to you?
AH: Well, I suppose it would--I loved the students. I found them eager and enthusiastic, and most of them hardworking. Of course you had always a few who didn't measure up, but most of them were extraordinary. I had never thought of education as a desperate need before, and they expressed that always. So that first summer I went back to summer school at the University of Minnesota.
ED: Oh, I see, I was going to ask you if you...
AH: And my father, I knew, had the other two, three others in school in college at the time, so I didn't want to be an expense to him. So I went downtown in Anoka to my hometown banker, Robert Aiken, and I'll never forget him. I told him that I needed a hundred dollars for tuition, and I wondered if he would loan it to me on my signature, and explained that I was working and would return it in the fall. And he did it. I asked him please not to tell my father because I didn't want him to be even burdened with that knowledge. If it was 'a little more than that, I knew he wouldn't have approved at all, but that's how I went back to Minnesota that summer. I took history because I had come to sense the importance of history, and realized that we who had built this country were out of it. And so I was beginning that study, trying to know what I should be saying to these young people which would steady them in their years to come. I also learned a good deal about the whole pattern of Southern living. The courtesies of it, the really good manners of it. I was reminded of it years later when Mrs. Roosevelt was asked about protocol and whether all this was necessary, and she said, "You know, that kind of thing is really set up to save us all from having each time to figure out what could be done under these circumstances, as a way of helping humanity find itself, and find﻿Page 39
each other." And I thought those Southern Negroes held that in their bones, there was a kind of...
Coming down a country road, my first part of, the end of my first year, and I ran into a woman who was carrying a basket of clothes on her head. I'd never seen anything like that, of course. So I was watching her and trying to be polite about it, and as she reached me, she said, "Good evenin1." So I looked around to see to whom she might be speaking. It didn't occur to me that she was speaking to me, because I knew I didn't know her. She said, "Hmm. You must be from that old stuck-up school up there." So I said, "What do you mean?" She said, "Well, you could at least speak." I said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know I had met you." And she said, "You don't have to meet me to be polite." And I stood in that road crying tears because she was an older woman, and I wouldn't have done anything to hurt her. So when I started crying she said, "Don't cry child, you'll learn better." So then, later we became friends. And she was a delightful person. But here was her custom being betrayed, you see.
At the end of the year, as I told you, 1 went back to summer school, and I returned to Rust because a lot of the teachers had thought I couldn't take it. I was determined that I would stay a second year. And that year I tried all sorts of experiments with students. They had no gymnasium, and no outlet, and many times they were piled up in their rooms when they should have been outside. So I'd take them on hikes. And I'd arrange with the matron to fix them sandwiches that we could take along, and that sort of thing. It was on one of those trips that suddenly there was a sound of a gun in the air. And one of the girls with me screamed just unbelievably. And it turned out that she had seen a white man dynamite her father to death, and whenever she heard that kind of sound she went to pieces emotionally.
And then I ran into this fifteen-year-old who'd never been anywhere or seen anything, and she used to blow her nose as a man would working on the rails. And I stopped her, shocked, the first time I saw it. She changed later. And she looked up at me with tears in her eyes and said, "What did I do wrong?" This was only my second day on the campus.
And then I met the letters of parents who said, "Please keep Jenny in school. I will send you some money next week." And maybe you got another letter with a dollar in it which said, "I want to pay this on Ann's account. I'll send more." And you knew that each instance they didn't have more to send. And then you saw commencements coming with the parents coming in, and some of them couldn't come. Others coming at great personal sacrifice. All this sort of thing you lived with not once in awhile--everyday. And great teachers who cared and who worked and who did the best they could for them. And perhaps a little too much discipline, I knew where my father had gotten it.
ED: You saw a whole lot of students...
AH: And, on Sunday, at about three in the afternoon, a quiet hour, at the quietest part of the Sunday afternoon when you were dying for﻿Page 40
some expression, some noise, some sound: silence at that hour. Your meditation was important. So you were really disciplined, teachers and students, and particularly women, because men were head, and there was no question.
The second year came, and I knew that I had to do something and decided that I should come North, and organize the North to free the Negroes of the South, who were the bravest people I'd ever seen. And to free some white people, too, because I had discovered a whole wagonload, I can see it now, of people coming down from the hillside, Southern white, speaking with great lack of any kind of refinement or sense, and they too were part of that rural working South. So I wanted to free all of them.
ED: What did you think you could do when you came North?
AH: Oh, organize the North. I was sure that it was different, you see.
ED: What...
AH: I knew it had its prejudices.
ED: But how do you mean organize?
AH: I knew that even though those white people from the hills had
difficulties and had suffered, that at least they .were white. And whenever they could say they were white, with blue eyes, they were home free. So while I was concerned about them, because I always had been taught to be concerned for all people, I knew that the major leadership had to come from people who were concerned with the failure of this country to recognize 3 00 years, nearly 400 years worth of free labor, nearly that much of talent of all kinds, and had robbed those people. Not only had they taken the products out of Africa, but they had taken the human being against his will. And I knew they were not immigrants, you see, they were the people of this soil, who had given so much and weren't having reasonable opportunity. So, I decided that I would approach churches and universities and business people in the North, and really somehow get a movement going.
The last day of school really strengthened that res'olve. It was commencement day, and the boys were wearing the traditional dark suits and ties, and the girls had made, many of them had made their own dresses and were wearing the traditional white. And it was a wonderful commencement because I knew most of them so well. I had worked with them, and thought with them, prayed over them (and they didn't even know it), prayed for wisdom to give them as much as I could that I knew they had to have to face a cruel world. And, in my excitement about going, I was also grateful for those parents and realized what they were putting into those young people, and hoped that they really understood it. A voice said to me, "Miss, I wants to see the President." Well, I looked at her, she was wearing one of those big ol' Southern skirts, I don't know whether you've ever seen one or not...
Yes. And, a blouse, and she looked soiled. I thought of her in India when one of the white persons travelling with me there said,﻿Page 41
"Aren't these people dirty?". And I said, "No, they probably wash oftener than you do, they just don't have New Tide with Extra Cleaning Power." I might've said that they don't have the water that they oughta have, too, but I didn't say that much. And I could say that because of my little old lady. She had looked soiled on that day, and I thought when she wants to see the President that she's not really presidential material. So in my best Christian manner I told her that I was sorry but the President was very busy, and could I be of help? She said, "Honey, is you a teacher?" And very proudly I said "Yes". "Well, if you is a teacher, I is gonna trust you." When anybody offers to trust me, you see, I have a special reaction. And so for the first time I really saw her as a human being, or, as an individual human being. And I said, "Yes, I'm a teacher," again. She reached down in the pocket of that big ol' skirt and pulled out her handkerchief, a big handkerchief really, a man's handkerchief, tied in knots, and with her little, gnarled, brown hands, work-worn, she began untying those knots and counted out money into my hand. In those days Mississippians didn't use paper money much, because there had been a panic and they had learned that paper money could be valueless. She counted out money in my hand, it wasn't much, two dollars, two dollars, and forty-five cents maybe, something like that. But she said words which helped me that day and kept me going through the years when somehow I had reached the stage where I couldn't stand this cursed culture any longer. She said, "Now listen, honey. I want you to give this money to the President. And I want you to take good care of it. I washed, and ironed, and scrubbed for it. I want some kid to have the chance I ain't never had." And that was kind of the final, the down-with-the-curtain, as I moved forward to organize everybody I could reach who had any sense of decency and honor, to free the African American, primarily, because he was the one denied every opportunity, no matter what his training was. And so I returned North.
ED: Where did you return, to your home town?
AH: Home, always I went home_. I had to have a job, of course, so the
question was what would I do. When I was in St. Paul, meeting some of mother's friends, I met a woman by the name of Mary Felts Dixon, she was the first African American executive I'd ever known. And she was elegance itself, she was from south Jersey, from Bridgeton, New Jersey, and I don't know whether you know that area or not, or know that King Charles sent a son over here, who was partially responsible f or the mixtures in that place. And she was a very attractive woman, on the brownish side, but completely aware of young people in a way that I hadn't expected, very thoughtful of us. She herself was an excellent executive, so we liked her, admired her.
ED: Where was she an executive?
AH: She had charge of a branch of the YWCA in St. Paul. And the branch was located in the place which had formerly been owned by an old friend of my mother's. And she had made it over into a spot where young people could come.
ED: This would be a black branch, right?﻿Page 42
AH: African American, yes.
ED: African American branch...
AH: I didn't know anything about the rest of the YWCA.
ED: Just knew her...
AH: I just knew her.
ED: And this Y...
AH: And what she thought of in the YWCA there. I can't recall ever having been in the central branch, or hearing anything about it. But I went to her and told her I wanted to be an executive in the YWCA, was it possible? And she referred me to two women: Eva D. Bowles, B-o-w-l-e-s, and Cordelia Wynn, W-y-n-n [Winn].
ED: I knew Eva Bowles in St. Louis.
AH: Did you!?
ED: Yes.
AH: In Columbus, Ohio.
ED: Columbus, yes.
AH: And the two of them were the national executives at the YWCA at 600 [i.e. 610] Lexington Avenue. So I went to them, first to Miss Bowles, later I knew Mrs. Wynn. And Miss Bowles said that she was looking for executives, and she had several places in mind.
ED: Was she located in New York at that time?
AH: Yes, 600 Lexington Avenue.
ED: Working at 600.
AH: They always worked there.
ED: So you came to New York, in other words?
AH: Yes. Yes, and talked with--no, I did not. I talked with Mrs.
Dixon, and she put me in touch with them, and I wrote them, giving my qualifications. And they wrote back, offering me several places. I selected, because it was North, and nearer Midwest, a town, Springfield, Ohio. It's near Columbus, forty-five miles from Columbus, about thirty miles, I guess, from Dayton. And I decided on that place because it was North. In the meantime I enquired about teaching positions in St. Paul, and discovered I couldn't teach in St. Paul, couldn't "expect" to get a job, let's put it that way. I think there were one or two teachers in, but it was a very closed situation.
ED: So this was the surprise for you.﻿Page 43
AH: This was a shock!
ED: A shock.
AH: It was then that I discovered that my professor had let me teach
Hamline freshmen because the high schools there would not take me as an apprentice teacher.
ED: You would have discovered this earlier had you not had this desire immediately upon graduation to go South.
AH: Yes, yes. If it hadn't been for that I would have known, but I didn't know. So that's how I happened to move into the YWCA, because I knew I must not return South until I could do something that was meaningful. I chose Springfield, Ohio, and went from St. Paul to Springfield, riding the train... Oh, I should have told you, when I went, all those trains have brought me interesting experiences. On the first one, I rode with Mollie Moon, going to Rust, (laughter)
ED: You mean the train we were talking about, that Jim Crow train out of Cairo, Illinois?
AH: That Jim Crow train, yes. And on this train I...
ED: Well, how did you know? I mean, did you know her?
AH: Oh, no, we got acquainted; by this time, I'm getting acquainted with anybody, you know.
ED: No, but remember we talked about you didn't know anybody on that first train ride South?
AH: Oh, that--not... On the train from Jackson to Holly Springs she was there.
ED: This first time in the South.
AH: Well anyway, on this one there was a girl by the name' of Katharine Jones. And she was, oh, so very sophisticated. Beautifully dressed, I mean expensively, so expensive that it sort of rang out. Turned out she was the only child of an architect who lived in Springfield.
When I got there, the executive was waiting to interview me, the white executive of the central branch. And I found on the interview that I would be--if I accepted it, and they accepted me--I would be in charge of the Clark Street, West Clark Street branch, which was the Negro branch, but they didn't say it, you see. They simply named it by the street it was on. And that there was a very good clientele there for me to work with, and all that sort of thing. This executive, the white executive of the central branch, had me for lunch that day. And I assumed that it was a courtesy--we had lunch in her office. I thought oh, it was awfully nice. I found out later that I couldn't eat in the cafeteria of the YWCA in that town.﻿Page 44
She also asked, she said the girls at the branch wanted lots of things, they wanted tap dancing. Well, I wasn't about to teach dancing, much less tap dancing, so I told her I didn't know what that was. And she got up and tried to demonstrate, looked as awkward as she possibly could. And I was really annoyed. I said I just wasn't, I had nothing, no information that would help me teach dancing. Well I think that because I was so green--I had learned the purpose of the YWCA on the way down. I've forgotten all of the words of it, but the idea was to promote fellowship among Christian women and girls, you know. So I told her I couldn't understand why they thought of such subjects as dancing for young people who were in grade school and high school, and some in college who needed all kinds of information and help. Well, she said I would discover that there were many needs that I probably hadn't thought about. Well that was all right.
Then I asked about the facilities. And she said, "Well, I'll take you over there. There is a large living room in the front, it;s a house, and behind it a still larger room which we use for exercises and banquets and things of that sort. There's an office and we have about a dozen bedrooms; we rent rooms to young people who are away from home. And I said, "Well what about the gymnasium facilities?" She said, "Well, um, you don't have any." I said, "Do you mean the whole YWCA doesn't have a gymnasium!?" Oh, she got red as a beet, she said, "Oh yes, we, we have them in the branch, in the, uh, central branch, uh, but they're not open to the other branches." So I was shocked again. This was Christian women in the North, supposed to have a purpose of fellowship.
Well, to make a long story short, I finally accepted the job, and decided to see what I could do with it. My first responsibility was fund-raising, because it was Fall and they had to have a budget. So I thought, well, white people are always impressed by my money; I'll just get busy and see that the community raises a large amount of money, then maybe they'll let us use the rest of the facilities. See, I still hadn't caught up with the whole history of the United States in terms of race and color.
So, I went to work. I organized like nobody has ever worked before. We had block--talk about block associations--we had block meetings. We had all sorts of meetings. Well, the women were not too excited, because they had tried so hard to make things happen and nothing had happened. Furthermore they'd been trying to get into the public school, and only two or three had had opportunity there. So they were not enthusiastic about my youthful exuberance. But, I worked there so hard at them I think they felt they had to help. The board was good, the board of directors was excellent, but you know, it wasn't in the mind of the people that I needed to raise this money.
I never will forget, I set up one block's meeting in a section of the city which was particularly deprived. And sent cards, 'cause by this time I discovered you can't call next door and get people to give, that you have to send mail! I'd sent these cards, and the women came. They were uninteresting, and only three or four. So finally one wonderful, older woman came to me, and she said, "Let me tell you what to do. You call me, and you make officers out of﻿Page 45
everybody who comes. And then announce it in the paper, and your next meeting you'll have a crowd." And it worked, it was my first (laughter), first lesson in community organization. It worked. We raised more money--we had a new cop, first time they'd ever had a Negro cop in that town, and we put a painting of him on a big piece of canvas on the outside of the door, with his hands saying, "Stop!" and the message was: "Come in and take out your membership."
Doctor Tobias came visiting the YMCA in that town—you remember Doctor Tobias who was the senior YMCA man, Channing H. Tobias. With all of his dignity, he came to that town t,o influence the YMCA where he had an unaggressive acceptor of almost anything. He came around to the YW to see me. He took one look at my cop, and he said, "I hope it works, it's a little bit..."--and he didn't use the word "bizarre" but that was the idea--"but it may work, you can't ever tell." I think he enjoyed it, even though he wasn't quite approving. It didn't go along with his dignity nor the dignity of the Young Women's Christian Association; but I had other ideas.
Well, we raised more money than they'd ever raised before. And there was a big Community Chest meeting planned, and we were supposed to report. And we got the women ready to report, and we had this money all listed, we were so thrilled we didn't know what to do. Two o'clock in the afternoon on the day of the community fund dinner, a telephone call, and it's my executive. "Um," that stutter that comes with white folks' tongue when they know they have to say something, and it's very unpleasant, and shouldn't be true. "I have to tell you that your women can't come tonight to the community fund meeting." I said,"Can't come! I thought we were all supposed to report, and we have the biggest report the branch has ever had!" "Yes, but the board of trustees has ruled that you cannot come to that dinner." So I said, "Well, I'm going to stand on the street corner and give all these people back their money." And I really meant to do it. And she said, "Wait a minute, I'll be right over." So she came over and sat at my desk, and I'll never forget it. I pulled out the membership card, and I said, "I thought I was coming to work for a Christian organization concerning the development of relationships. And you tell me that this part of the fellowship cannot report tonight!? And I tell you very honestly I'm returning the money. I wouldn't dare turn their money in in this situation." So she went back, I don't know what she did, but she called later and said that she'd gotten the agreement that two of us could come. And that was the first time I had ever realized the asset that color can be sometime.
So, we had a meeting. I called the women, and they came, a board meeting. And I told them the situation, I said, "I don't want to go, frankly." So they said, "Yes you're going, you're our executive. But we're going to send Bertha Cooley with you." Bertha Cooley was the treasurer, and she was good and brown, they couldn't miss her. She said, "The reason we're doing that is if we just let you go, they may put you in the corner someplace, and nobody will quite realize fully that you're there." So Miss Cooley was to meet me. She was a former teacher, as elegant as she could be, and as sensible as any person I ever knew. And she knew funds, and if there was any question she would be prepared to answer, so I was thrilled.﻿Page 46
There was a big clock in the municipal auditorium, and we were to meet there. I stood there and waited, and waited. We were due in at six o'clock, and at six o'clock Bertha Cooley had not come. I called her home to learn that she had dropped dead on her way to the dinner. At that time, as far as I was concerned, they had killed her. Now it wasn't that simple, she had a heart condition, and the stress was very great, so it was an additional stress she didn't need. But as far as I was concerned they had killed her, and I said so.
They sent me to Chicago for two weeks vacation to get myself together. And I went because I was so desperate, and I came back and decided to go to summer school in New York that year. Meantime the women did report--Bertha Cooley reported, they all knew she was there and they had to accept.it, so that much was accomplished.
ED: Wait a minute. Bertha Cooley dropped dead.
AH: Yeah, on the way to the dinner.
ED: Yeah, but as far as they were concerned, what...?
AH: They were concerned that... We had nobody to make the meeting. And I saw to it that the announcement that Bertha Cooley was dead was made in the meeting; they wanted to suppress that. It wasn't a part of the whole thing. Announced that she was dead, and of course they were all embarrassed and I was so glad of it I didn't know what to do.
ED: You didn't go.
AH: I went.
ED: You went, and saw to it...
AH: I was there! You see, when I called and found she was dead! So there was nothing to do but go in and everybody knew I was there. But I saw to it that they made the announcement of her death, and described the kind of work she had done for the association. So, she accomplished more in death than she would have accomplished in life. But that didn't mean anything to me...
ED: Yes, and they certainly knew you were there...
AH: Yeah, and they knew I was there, they had to face that. I went to Chicago, stayed the two weeks, came back, and I began to press for the opportunity for our girls to use the gymnasium and for them to have other opportunities. One of them had come by my office one day--my room--and had seen a picture on my desk, and she said, "Is that a white girl or a colored girl?" and I said, "She happens to be white. Why?" "All I want white people to do for me is to pass me, and if they owe me anything, pay." She had been the honor student at the end of her high school career, and been refused the award that was normally given. So, these are the kinds of things, you see, I had to deal with, and I knew something had to be done.﻿Page 47
So Eva Bowles mentioned the National Training School, and said that I'd probably need some training. I think she was a little disturbed by my militant attitude too, because, remember, she was brand new and they were giving her a hard time. I didn't know all that then. But she suggested that I come to the training school at 610 Lexington Avenue, and that was my first New York address. I arrived on the Fourth of July, thrilled because there was an atmosphere that hit me, a kind of universal atmosphere that I liked. This was going to be it. It was a Saturday, and I had come on that the train with Frances Waugh, W-a-u-g-h, an executive at Columbus. And she taught me to play cards on the train; by the way, you didn't play cards in my home either. And she taught me to, she said, "You'll never brag again that you don't play cards." She pulled out her deck and made me learn. Something called "Hearts"; I've never forgotten that, and I've never played it since! Well, the first thing we did was to find out how to get to Harlem.
ED: Was she black, was she African American?
AH: Yes, yes. From Columbus. And she was in the Y in Columbus, Ohio.
ED: Similar position to yours in Springfield.
AH: That's right, and we cleared with each other and came through
together. The first thing we did was to come to Harlem. The old Lexington-Lenox streetcar came right from that door right straight up to the corner of 13 8th Street, I think it was.
ED: ... and Lenox...
AH: And Lenox.
ED: Right where we practically are sitting now.
AH: That1s right.
ED: Because this interview, we haven't said, is taking place in the Schomburg Library.
AH: That's right, in Harlem. We stood on the corner of 13 8th Street, and just a-watch the Negroes, as we said then, pass. And we were thrilled! We went from there, from that particular corner, to the YWCA up here. And of course you know that the YWCA in Harlem, the West 137th Street YWCA--still named for the street, to keep from saying it's the segregated branch--was really a mecca. Everybody who was anybody who came to town stopped by there, signed the guestbook and made friends with whomever they knew, or had their friends meet them there. It was the only place where women could stay. No hotels would receive us. You know, people talk up New York as though it was always a very democratic city. Nothing is further from the truth!
ED: Do you remember when we couldn't stay at the Theresa Hotel, located right in the heart of Harlem?
AH: And do you remember when we couldn't eat at Frank's, located right in the heart of Harlem? And weren't expected to buy in﻿Page 48
Bloomstein's, the department store, in the heart of Harlem? In fact, at the corner of 137th Street and Seventh Avenue, was a cigar store. Mrs. Saunders, Mrs. Cecelia Cabaniss Saunders, executive of the West 137th Street YWCA, when she was building the Emma Ransom House, which is the residence, couldn't rent space in that store, for a man who needed some headquarters there who was supervising our main operation, they wouldn't rent her space. That's how bad it was.
So that summer, Mrs. Saunders showed us the Y; we were invited to the summer dance on the roofs, they used to have...
ED: That's right. Everybody came...
AH: Everybody came, all the young people from all over the country...
ED: And all the students studying in New York.
AH: Students studying in New York...
ED: Those were great days...
AH: Oh, they were fantastic days! You met all of them. In fact, the first social affair I attended with my husband was the rooftop. I wasn't with him...
ED: Did you meet--where did you meet?
AH: I wasn't with him that night, but he was there. And we danced
twice, and everybody talked about us: "Who was that cheat who was dancing with him, two times in succession?" But that was the center of everything, all the great figures came. Carter Woodson arrived one day and I was working on the desk that particular day...
ED: Well let's see, now let's get you to that YWCA, 'cause I know you worked there...
AH: That's right... No, we went in, and then this was during the summer I visited, and I went back to Ohio for another year.
ED: Oh you went back to the Y in Ohio with the summer training?
AH: Yes! But I went knowing I was coming back. The training was excellent, actually, and I've always been sorry that they discontinued it. They need it. They needed it then and they need it now.
ED: They are doing it now.
AH: Not really. We had a basic...
ED: We have a new volunteer administrative training--I'11 tell you about that, some other time, it's really great what's going on now.
AH: ED:
Well, this was not volunteers, this was staff.
Staff. They are doing staff training... Really good training﻿Page 49
AH: I'm glad to hear it because they really need it.
ED: They skipped for awhile but they're back into it now.
AH: I'm glad to hear it, because we had an intensive experience, and it was there that I ran into the first Southern white girl who was in trouble, because she said to me, "How can I go home and be as reasonable and honorable and decent as I am in New York? - My father is a Kleagle in the Ku Klux Klan." And it was the first time I realized that their leadership had problems too, and that was important.
ED: You know over and over again we find that in the YWCA, Black and white women, especially in those days, it was their first opportunity to encounter each other.
AH: At all. But you see, just as the sixties emerged out of the
students, the YWCA among African Americans emerged from the student movement. And the students were willing to come together.
ED: Right. And they're the ones that pressed the Y to move forward.
AH: And they're responsible, really, for bringing the executives in.
ED: Right, right. It's always from the students that this comes. So you went...
AH: So I went back...
ED: What was your year like?
AH: Oh, I was just there for the summer.
ED: No, what was the year in Ohio like?
AH: Oh, I reported everything that I had discovered. By this time I had a wonderful board of women who really believed in me and would do almost anything that I needed done. It was just a remarkable situation. But I couldn't get anywhere. So I talked with 'em about it. They suggested that since I had enjoyed the New York experience, maybe I should consider coming East. It was fair to me to have an extension of the ability they said I had. And I've always been grateful for that. And they sent me off, they had a party for me, and I had gifts such as you get at a shower, you know. I came to New York and worked in Jersey City as executive of the branch there. Again, Ege Avenue branch, they always had to be named for streets.
ED: Or Phillis Wheatley.
AH: Right. Phillis Wheatley was not YWCA, you see.
ED: Whenever you heard a Phillis Wheatley branch, though, you knew it was the black branch.﻿Page 50
AH: That's right. But that was much later, you see. We weren't allowed to use our great heroines at first, because they just didn't even think about it, because they didn't know about it. And we didn't know clearly enough to figure out how to make that idea function.
Jersey City was then called New York's bedroom, 'cause most of the people had jobs in New York and came back. But it was here that I discovered the power of the corporations, the power of their control through their firms. And it came in a very fascinating way.
I was working with the domestic workers and organized them into a YWCA club. They would plan through their little executive council the programs they wanted. And then, to my horror, they wouldn't follow through. And I really was cross about it, and I sent for the president, May Ryan. I sent for the president and I said, "May, you have a good group of girls. You have developed interesting programs all the time, but you never follow through." So she looked at me and said, "Have you ever worked in a laundry?" And I said, "No". And she said, "Don't you have vacation next week?" And I said, "Yes". She said, "Why don't you come and spend a week of your vacation working in the laundry." I said, "How do I get a job there?" She said, "Well, wear a housedress." In those days executives were supposed to dress a little bit like executives, and very often little silk dresses. "Wear an ordinary housedress, and come to the door of the laundry. A woman will approach you, and say, 'Whattya want?' And you say you want to work. She'll ask you what you can do, and tell her you can shake. She'll put you to work and I'll follow through with you inside."
So with those meager instructions I went to the laundry. And a little short, Italian woman--never will forget her--I can see her now, said to me, "What do you want?" I'd never been spoken to rudely before. So I said, "A job," very meekly. And she said, "What do you do?" I said, "Shake." So she said, "Get busy!" and pointed me to a vat in this great big room. And I went to the vat to discover that I was supposed to shake out things that had just come from the tubs. But in my ignorance I grabbed two sheets. She yells over, "Hey there! I can see you're green. Take the small things first." So I started with the towels. You shake 'em out, put the selvage edge up, and put 'em across the tub. I did that all... day... long. The floor was a stone floor, and my feet aching.
The next day I was promoted--that was through my friend inside, she worked this out--and I had to feed the big, steaming mangles. And I fed them all day long and fingers were blistered, and my feet were just aching like a toothache.
I got promoted for the next day to catch. You see, she was determined that I have the full experience, and wanted me to catch the things as they came through. All of this was done in an atmosphere where there was not a decent toilet nor even a lunchroom: nothing. Mothers nursing children went home for the lunchtime because their homes were fairly near in many cases.
At the end of the week I think I had earned (and I had gotten to be pretty swift by this time) something like seven dollars. And you﻿Page 51
talk about worn to the bone. I knew why my industrial club girls didn't follow through. And the domestics--it was the same way. Most of their jobs were sleep-in jobs. We had to change our meeting date because they could only come on Thursdays. And those who didn't have sleep-in jobs were working overtime and travelling to them. So what I inherited from the society on a Thursday night was about fifty young people so robbed that really they only needed a bed and came to me primarily because it was a friendly, warm situation.
I reported all these problems, including the low wages, and no union would take them for other kinds of work. I didn't dream that a union composed mostly of immigrants would think of discriminating against people on account of color, I just couldn't believe it. So I went to the board of directors, I went to the executive, and said I'd like to talk to the board of directors about our girls' program. By this time I was smart enough to not discuss the details I wanted to present.
ED: Now you'd gone to the board of directors of the central branch.
AH: There was only one board of directors. You had in the branch a
committee of management, which is the way of giving them a little power and keeping them out of the board. And at first they didn't even have them on the board as representing the branch. So she said she'd be glad to have me do that, and she thought I was going to talk about these poor, deprived children, you see. I don't use the word "deprived," by the way, I use "robbed." These poor, robbed young people. But I wasn't talking about that, I was talking about a society which let this happen. And so I made my little spiel. It turns out that one of the owners of the laundry was a big contributor to the YWCA, and he must not be offended. And this was campaign time. So that was the first time I realized the impact of financial corporate power in the lives of the little person way down in the heap.
During that whole time I kept coming to the Harlem YWCA, which we then called the West 137th Street YWCA, to talk to Mrs. Saunders. And I knew most of her staff by this time, and if I had this kind of problem I talked to that person, and another--she had about a hundred people, experts in anything you needed. And so I would get all sorts of information.
One Friday night she asked me if I worked in the YWCA, West 137st Street, what would I like to do? Well, I was a little startled. I said, "I'd like to do membership." 'Cause I had the realization that if I ever was going to get any organization going, it had to be of lots of people from all sorts of areas of life. She said, "You want it?" I said, "Yes". And she didn't talk about it anymore.
When I went home, back to Jersey City--I'm now in Jersey City--my girls' worker, Maude Green Johnson, who was getting married and leaving me by the way, and that was another reason I was ready to move, said to me, "Well, did you tell her you'd like to have the job this fall?" I said, "She didn't offer me a job, she just asked what I might like to do." She said, "Fool! She was offering you a job, I'll bet you money." Back to New York I came. "Mrs. Saunders, were﻿Page 52
you offering me the possibility of membership executive here?" I don't now whether you know her or not, she had the most infectious laugh, and she threw back her head and laughed and she said, "Well, I had thought about it." And in that fall I came to Harlem as membership executive of the West 137th Street YWCA, and the first time in my work experience had a swimming pool, a gymnasium, classrooms, a beauty salon, a training school for business and professional people, a domestic training school, all of the things...
ED: And a residence...
AH: And the residence in addition. And a lobby of service to people. And a cafeteria. All of it.
ED: Here. The most wonderful place in the world.
AH: You will never know how excited I was. That year, everybody came.
I had worked on the desk a little while, I had started to tell you this a moment ago, when a gentleman came to the desk and asked for Mrs. Saunders. And I said, "She's busy at the moment but I will reach her for you. May I tell her who's calling?" And he said, "You don't know me?" And I'm just 'barrassed as I can be. I said, "I'm sorry but I don't." "Um, Carter G. Woodson." I said, "Carter G. Woodson?" He said, "Yes. You don't even know that name, do you?" I said, "No sir, I'm very sorry but I don't." I saw the smile twinkle in his eye, so I knew he was ribbing me, but I still don't know who he was.
So I couldn't wait till he left talking with Mrs. Saunders, saying "Mrs. Saunders, who was that? And why am I supposed to know him?" So then she told me what a great historian he was, and that in 1920, he had begun this whole effort to develop the Association of Negro Life and History, and what a charming person he was, and he'd been a teacher, and he'd spent most of his own money to develop this program. And I hadn't known any of that. Well, I was embarrassed. He'd been a teacher, and I was embarrassed as I could be to think that I didn't know him, and should have.
At this time Dark Tower was in Harlem, right around the corner. And we used to go there on Sunday nights to listen to the greats. And there were all kinds of greats rushing through the community--I say rushing, because they were on travel assignments many of them. And they came to report to us, because they couldn't get a press you know. It's as bad--it was as bad then as it is now. You don't get a press with a positive, ever. And you didn't get a press for our truth. So that in Harlem here, Dr. DuBois came, William Pickens--William Pickens, the field secretary of the NAACP. I never will forget he spoke before a group of us one day. I had brought in a number of white students from colleges around the city, around the country, the Eastern seaboard, and he was talking about Germany. It was during the time when Germany was at war with us, you see. And he said--someone in the group said, "I cannot stand Germans any longer!" And he said, "Well, I know how you feel, but let me tell you, it's been awfully hard for me to be anti-German." And their mouths dropped open and said, "Why!?" He said, "Well, I'll tell you why. I studied in Germany. And I could get a haircut and not have﻿Page 53
anybody worry because it was kinky. And I could eat when I was hungry without any problem. And the people were friendly and warm and accepted me wherever I went. And were interested in anything I had to say. So, you know, I sort of love Germany. I'm sorry they went wrong in a couple of spots, but my country has been so wrong that I have to forgive her."
Oh, those kids didn't know what to do, but they were really thrilled.
ED: Tell us a little bit more about Dark Tower because some people who are listening to this may not know.
AH: Dark Tower was a center on... Was it 139th...
ED: A hundred and thirty-sixth, I thought.
AH: Maybe sixth. I'm not sure. It was around the corner, I can see the house.
ED: Yes, I think it was right in this block that we are in now.
AH: No, this is thirty-five...
ED: We're at thirty-six though, because we're on the other side of the Schomburg Library.
AH: It was near Seventh Avenue... I know that.
ED: And it was a private house.
AH: It was a private house...
ED: Belonging to...
AH: Madame C.J. Walker. And she was the beautician. She was our Helena Rubinstein.
ED: She was a millionaire, wasn't she?
AH: Yes, right. She had this lovely home up on the Hudson, and she supported this Dark Tower.
ED: But what was it, I mean, Dark Tower was a gathering place?
AH: It was a gathering place for speakers and celebrities. DuBois came there, Pickens came there, the ministers--outstanding ministers in this community occasionally, William Lloyd Imes...
ED: Kind of like soirees on Sunday evenings.
AH: Not really--lectures. It was much more, it was really a formal kind of. . .
ED: And what happened during the week there?﻿Page 54
AH: I don't know. I went to the lectures, and I presume that during the week they also might have had them, because there was always something going there.
ED: The great gathering place...
AH: Great place...
ED: To hear and see everybody.
AH: And people reported on what they'd discovered around the country,
you know, and on improvements that were being made. Langston Hughes used to do his poetry...
ED: Countee Cullen.
AH: Countee Cullen, who read his poetry beautifully, by the way, and Richard B. Harrison. Everybody who was making headway in any field...
ED: This was during the Harlem Renaissance, wasn't it?
AH: Yes, yes, it was really, because it was from about--my experience
with it was from about '26 through, so that it was about that time. Only the Renaissance has been so badly reported. It has been reported as though it was a time of entertainment essentially...
ED: Instead of cultural contribution.
AH: Yes. And, the entertainers were known, and everybody was proud of their having arrived, but places like Small's and Cotton Club and all those places were...
[Tape off/Tape on]
AH: Two major spots were part of the entertainment world for young
people, that was for their dances and social functions, and they had beautiful ones held both at Savoy and the Renaissance. Both of those places were outstanding social spots for all of us.
ED: Where black--where African American young people could go.
AH: Yes.
ED: Not denied to us like Small's Paradise.
AH: No, not--they were for and with us. Now, one has to be careful because you don't want in any sense to denigrate the artists who performed in these places, because they were quite ready to perform for us, and they were a part of our social institutions. But there hasn't been, in the discussion of the Renaissance, enough of the kind of reporting of what I call "social engineers" who functioned in this town. For instance, Cecelia Cabaniss Saunders, St. Martin,...
ED:
Johnny Johnson.﻿Page 55
AH: John H. Johnson of St. Martin's Church. Shelton Hale Bishop, the father, the senior Shelton Hale Bishop of...
ED: St. Philip's...
AH: St. Philip's Episcopal Church. William Lloyd Imes, of the
Presbyterian Church, St. James. St. James Presbyterian Church--they just had their eighty-third anniversary, by the way, and I was the guest speaker. At St. Mark's, Reverend Robinson, John W. Robinson, the first chairman of the Better Schools Committee. Our St. Martin's director was really responsible for opening up the stores on 125th Street, and he doesn't often get the recognition. John Johnson led that fight.
ED: John Johnson of the church, Reverend Johnson...
AH: Reverend John Johnson of the St. Martin's Episcopal Church led the fight to open up 125th Street. Adam Powell, Sr., was here, and he was a fantastic person. And then Adam Powell, Jr., led the fight for the buses, opening up the buses in the city.
ED: As drivers...
AH: Yes, as drivers of the buses. In all of these many areas you had extraordinary people at work with them, and you also had the YMCA. I was trying to think of the executive then, before Mr. Craft...
ED: Taylor.
AH: Taylor.
ED: Mr. Arthur Taylor.
AH: Arthur Taylor was active. Not as effective, because the YMCA never was as effective as the YW, but they were still there, and they had a residence, which was very good, and a cafeteria--allf of these services important to the community. They also had swimming pool and gymnasium activities...
ED: At the YMCA...
AH: ...at the YMCA, but they weren't as active. They weren't as
aggressive on the social scene as these others that I've mentioned, and of course there are many others that... The employment program got started through Adam Powell; when the bus program developed, we began working more in that area. Arnold Johnson was one of his major assistants. You know it's always dangerous to mention names because there are a dozen others that you should mention. But it was an extraordinary, vital time...
ED:	And this was the late twenties and the thirties, wasn't it?
AH:	The early thirties, yes.
ED:	Through the depression period.
AH:	Yes, yes, quite beyond the depression. In fact to about '35.
﻿Page 56
ED: Yes, about '35 '36.
AH: From '29 to'35 was that intensive period when everything was moving. Jack Nail was running the housing program.
ED: Right. Parker and Nail, was it? Or Nail and another name.
AH: Nail and Parker.
ED: Nail and Parker, right.
AH: Terry. I always remembered Rock Terry, he was in real estate and had made a good deal of money. At one of our campaigns he gave us our first big check: $750.
ED: Revenue, YWCA campaign.
AH: Oh, we were so thrilled with the YWCA campaign! His wife was on the board, and we had a very distinguished board. Mrs. Emma Ransom, the widow of Bishop Ransom (not then), the wife of Bishop Ransom, was the person for whom the Emma Ransom House was named, and she was a very dynamic part of the board.
And there was a Mrs. Michaels, just the most gracious woman who ever lived, who was on the board. And Mrs. William Pickens. Mrs. Pickens was probably the most most cultured woman I every met anywhere: white, green, black, brown, Indian, anything you'd want to name. She used to organize trips to Europe when most Americans only knew the section of Europe they came from, you know?
ED: And Black Americans weren't going to.
AH: Not to any extent.
ED: African Americans weren't going to Europe.
AH: Thank you. Weren't going to any extent. It was a tremendous
period. Mabel Staupers, Mabel Keaton Staupers, was working in the whole health field and stressing the importance of the nurse, because our nurses weren't getting any kind of opportunity. She organized the National Association of Colored Nurses.
ED: And Mrs. Peyton Anderson, wasn't she serving on your board?
AH: She was serving, yes. She was a good person too... Ruth Morgan Roberts...
ED: Was serving on your board or working for the Y?
AH: Yes, she was... No, no, none of these were working. They were volunteers...
ED: Who was your staff? Let's see: there was Cecelia Cabaniss Saunders, was Mildred Fisher on your...﻿Page 57
AH: Oh heavens! Mildred Brown Fisher, Emma Shields Penn-- Mildred came later. Emma Shields Penn, Gladys Burton Parker--her father and mother, by the way, work in Springfield, Ohio. She's been here before I came, and her mother and father were pillars of the community there. Leolia Nelson, who was the physical ed. person, and she really could teach swimming.
ED: Who was in charge of the trade school?
AH: Emma Shields Penn. And Louise Parrott Cochran was the girls' worker. And she was fabulous.
ED: And also didn't we have...
AH: Nora Jiles Hill was in the residence.
ED:	Followed by Mrs. Pope.
AH:	Oh, yes, but she was later, she came in later.
ED:	You were there at the height of a wonderful staff, weren't you?
AH:	Oh, and learned so much from all of it.
ED:	How long did you stay?
AH:	Five years.
ED:	As membership secretary. Did you move to other positions?
AH: Oh, I did all sorts of things, but my--I kept the title Membership Secretary because that's where the people were. I organized domestic workers; I did the study which made them put the model apartment in the building. The thing I loved about Mrs. Saunders is that you'd offer some idea, and if she didn't see it she'd say so. But if you did it and it worked, it was the bear we had killed! And it was really fun. We had all kinds of distinguished guests for our forum hours, and I helped run them. We studied the political picture, and John Johnson was the first one up here to run for City Council. And we supported him, and the central YWCA got in touch, "You're not supposed to be partisan in your politics." And Mrs. Saunders says, "Well this has to be partisan because he's the only African American running. And all of my staff is asked to do door-to-door." And we did.
ED: She was an unafraid woman.
AH: Completely free, and independent. And didn't care a hoot about publicity.
ED: Now we're going to take you from the YWCA to your next...
AH: You're going to take me from Harlem. When Mrs. Saunders went on
vacation one year I decided--oh, MaBelle White Williams was on that staff too, and I...
ED: What did she do, what did MaBelle...﻿Page 58
AH: MaBelle-~a little bit of everything. I laughed because we always
accused Mrs. Saunders of liking her better than any of us. She was very, very good looking, and had a great deal of charm. And Mrs. Saunders had no personal concern about those things for herself, but she liked to have it around. Oh, and Winona Bond Logan was our girls' worker. And Winona was another one we accused her of having favorites with, because she was young--quite young--and very attractive. And we said she liked MaBelle for her charm, and Winona for her youth. But all of the staff people were respected by her, and they respected her.
ED: She was a great executive.
AH: And she had a man who did supervising, a Mr. Elmendorf, who was really an engineer. And he handled that maintenance staff--you could keep time by where the maintenance men were working.
ED: These are wonderful things to know about.
AH: Oh, I learned so much.
ED: Wonderful, wonderful period in our life in New York. We want to... When you were travelling for the YWCA, was this activist period or before?
AH: I didn't ever travel for the YWCA.
ED: Oh. I'm thinking of when I first met you in St. Louis, when I was a little girl.
AH: Oh, I was there with my sister and her new husband. It was strictly a vacation trip. I wasn't functioning for the Y at all. No, I went to Philadelphia next. They needed an executive, and I decided that I had stayed, that this was a cocoon, and that I needed to get out and try my own wings apart from an organization which was really built and ready to move. And so I went to Philadelphia as executive of the Catherine Street branch this time starting in a situation where color was a problem because they were accustomed to employing only fair people. And I employed a full brown staff, got a write-up in the Philadelphia Tribune, by Joseph Baker, I don't know whether you ever knew him or not.
ED: Oh, I remember Joe Baker, yes.
AH: But Joe Baker wrote me up for having the gall to bring to
Philadelphia all these brown people, and he did it, of course, tongue-in-cheek.
ED: Tongue-in-cheek, because I'm sure he approved highly.
AH: But there, you'll be interested, Crystal Bird Fauset was the
chairman of our Committee of Management. And you know how bright she was, she came out of the National Girls' Program in the YWCA to that chairmanship. And at the time gave really good, solid leadership when we had all of the distinguished women in Philadelphia on that board. And once the National--when the﻿Page 59
National had a convention there, we invited the whole National to come to the Catherine Street branch, and that was the first time that had been done. But there were people in Philadelphia who would hot have anything to do with the branch because they said it was segregation, and it surely was. And the facilities, however, were a little more open there than they had been.
I stayed there a couple of years, and probably would have stayed longer because it was moving very well, but my husband wrote me a letter and said...
ED: We haven't, we haven't met your husband yet.
AH: Oh that's right, you didn't, did you.
ED: I remember a story you told me once of hearing his voice, you were at the 137th Street Y, and you overheard him in another room. He was in the auditorium, was he singing?
AH: Yes. I had met him, though, before that, it was a strange sort of situation. His mother, Mrs. John Hedgeman, was a member of my volunteer group which met on Thursday nights. Now these were housewives and women who were in domestic service who only had Thursday off. And his mother helped me with all of this. She was a little bitty woman--my husband's six feet, as you know, I never could figure out how such a tiny woman could have such big sons-well anyway, she came by the desk, and I was writing invitations for one of the summer dances on the roof of the YW, we had them every summer. And she said to me, "What are you doing?" And I said, "I'm sending out invitations for our dance." "Well, why don't you ever invite my sons?" "Oh," I said, "this is for grown people." I thought her sons had to be little because she was so little. And she looked young too. "Well," she said, "I have a six-foot son." A few days later she came by with him and introduced us. I thought gee, she really did well this time! And I started—Mildred Fisher was on the desk, Mildred Brown Fisher--so I started calling him my. Secret Passion, because I was going around with somebody else, and everybody knew it, so I called him my Secret Passion. And Mildred had instructions that whenever he came into the lobby for any reason to let me know. And she'd call--you know how demure she can be--"Your S.P. is out here." So I'd grab a pad and pencil and out front--I had business. By this time I had a very interesting setup. He would take me to the musical things, I had another boyfriend who was interested in special kinds of restaurants and so I--and also in the, oh, what was the theater?
ED: The Renaissance?
AH: No.
ED: Downtown?
AH: Vaudeville... The Palace! He'd take me to the Palace, and then some elegant place to eat afterwards, and this was very nice. And another one who didn't make much money, so we went walking. And Merritt came along and it got to be music, so I really had a well rounded, a well rounded kind of experience.﻿Page 60
ED: Now Merritt is your husband, and we haven't identified him, he's Merritt Hedgeman.
AH: We haven't gotten married yet. My membership office at the Y had a trap door in the side wall, and one day I heard a tenor voice, and remember my father was a tenor and tenors always attracted me. And I opened the door and peeked in, and realized that it was Merritt Hedgeman. And that's how I got acquainted with his voice.
ED: In other words you had known him and liked him...
AH: I had met him and liked him, but I didn't know him well.
ED: But you didn't realize that he was such a great singer.
AH: Oh, and that, that voice was just really something. I was never as moved by a voice. Now he taught me the meaning of the spirituals. And that was a great help because I had...
ED: You hadn't had experience with them before you went South, had you?
AH: Yes.
ED: Had you?
AH: I had heard a group which came to the Chautauqua in Anoka,
Minnesota. They sang on the Chautauqua Program, and it was a group my father had trained once, in Chicago.
ED: Did your Father's group sing spirituals too?
AH: I don't know. I would assume so, but I don't honestly know.
ED: I would assume so, "Songs of the South."
AH: "Songs and Stories of the South." I think it was almost inevitable. Although he had--the things that he would sing would have been of that calibre. He hated what was called "ragtime"; he would have a fit if he could hear the quality of voice and program of what is called music today. It wasn't just the opera idea but it was the total business of the meaning of the voice, the fullness of it, the importance of using it correctly, the nuance. And his objection, I think, to jazz--not jazz, that wasn't the word used then, ragtime-was essentially out of the way in which the South had used it to exploit. I've decided that I can't prove that.
ED: But it seems consistent with the way he looked at things.
AH: That's right.
ED: So, you couldn't stay in Philadelphia because—were you by now married?
AH: By now we were. No, by now, when I went to Philadelphia. He and
his mother took me to Philadelphia. They had a beautiful car at the time, and they took me over. And Lucille Burleigh, who had the﻿Page 61
flower shop on Seventh Avenue for so many years sent me my first orchid.
So I left for Philadelphia in the Cadillac Merritt's mother had, and with Merritt driving, and went to the Philadelphia job. Well, by November we were both missing each other on the trains, you know. I would decide to come in to surprise him or he'd come to surprise me, and we'd miss each other. So finally he wrote me this very sharp note the last of October, and announced that either I was going to marry him or quit him. So, I came in that Wednesday, November the first, and I had a business meeting at the YW, which was my excuse for coming, and I was glad to have it, and we got married that afternoon.
Where?
Just like that. City Hall?
No, Long Island. We decided that we were going to keep it secret for awhile, and so we used my sister's address on Long Island, and got married at — actually we got married, I was thinking about the license, we got married in Harlem. I told you Harlem is my Mecca. We got married in Harlem by Reverend Seymour Hill. Do you know him, did you know him even?
No, I didn't know him.
Fantastic man, who developed a program for ministers who had not had a chance to finish theology. He was a Yale graduate, in theology and he planned this whole program—it still goes on by the way—and his wife Nora Jiles Hill was the executive of the Emma Ransom House at the time...
After Mrs. Saunders.
No, Mrs. Saunders was the whole: Emma Ransom House had its own executive.
Oh, yes, right, right, the residence.
And so, we were married in their home at their fireplace. And Merritt's mother was real cute. She had heard that we were going together...
Where did the Long Island mixup come in? We got our license in Long Island.
License in Long Island, using that address, and the marriage here in Harlem.
And Mrs.--Reverend Hill, no—Merritt's mother came to see me one night at the Y, and she said she had heard that Merritt and I were getting married, this was before we were, and she hoped that if we did—oh, she asked me, "Are you getting married?" And I said, "Why﻿Page 62
don't you ask Merritt?" She said, "If I asked him, you would wonder what I had said to him that he didn't tell you. So I decided to come to you." Well, that wasn't the total reason. After I got to know him, I knew that it wouldn't have done her any good to have asked him, but I didn't know that, then, and I admired her for doing it that way. So she said, "I just want one promise out of you: if you do get married, will you let me be present." And we did. So his mother was there, and Reverend and Mrs. Hill, and we were married at their fireplace.
ED: Now, you were working in Philadelphia.
AH: Yes.
ED: So you went back to your j ob and...
AH: Went back to the job.
ED: Stayed how long?
AH: And stayed then until spring. Came back that spring, because it was just no sense for us to be passing each other on the road, and being worried and all of that.
ED: Was Merritt singing in various places at that time? Was he travelling?
AH: Yeah. Travelling some, doing all sorts of things, and also working in a bank. I mean, just endless things that you do when you're trying to take expensive singing lessons. He studied in Boston awhile too, and in--and at Peabody. He had Roland Hayes's teacher, in Boston.
ED: I see. What was his name, or do you remember?
AH: [Arthur J.] Hubbard, Hubbard.
ED: Oh, no wonder his voice is so good.
AH: And he raved about his voice.
ED: I can remember hearing Merritt sing in the days when I lived in Harlem, beautiful voice.
AH: And of course, in those days, getting on radio and television, if we told you the stories of the way in which people got rejected you wouldn't believe 'em.
ED: People today wouldn't believe it.
AH: They wouldn't believe it. He was in a contest once, they were
offering an amateur kind of contest, and he trained a young Italian to sing "Pagliacci" and then he himself was on. The young Italian won the award, and he didn't. But the thing that really hurt was the secretary of the producer got him aside and said, "You have a voice which comes over so beautifully, and we so desperately need a tenor, that I wish you would talk to the producer about it. But﻿Page 63
please don't tell him that I said this to you." He asked the producer for--and the engineers would come out and tell him "Your voice records better than most that we record." He went to the producer and talked about it. The producer said, "Well, you have a beautiful voice but we don't have a vacancy." Just like that. You know, it was even difficult to have any man sing in the same studio with whites, man or woman. All of this is unbelievable, but this was it. Of course, it's just as bad now, it's just more subtle.
ED: Yes, it's more subtle, and also a lot of young people don't understand that this is what happened at that time.
AH: And then another time a big producer wanted to use an interracial group, and he thought he could get funding for it. And that time, really--I was in Brooklyn then--that time really got to us because the group itself had melded beautifully and they had everything in it: Indian, Chinese, African American...
ED: What was the name of the group?
AH: I don't know. It didn't get started then, so it didn't get a name. But the producer was interested, and they went to rehearsals, and they even had contracts. Then one of the contributors backed out, and that ruined it.
ED:	Again.
AH:	I don't get it.
ED:	Again this corporate power.
AH:	Yeah.
ED:	You went to Brooklyn, you said. Now was that from Philadelphia?
AH: No, I went first, no, from the YWCA I went to Philadelphia YW. When I came back I had no work, and it turned out that the State Employment Service needed interviewers, and I went to work with the State Employment Service with Corrita Roen, who was really a fabulous executive, right here on 135th Street. It was a wonderful experience. And during that time I discovered other kinds of discrimination. The New York telephone company had a code: LHP. I went to Mrs. Roen and said, "What does this mean?" She said, "Longhaired Protestant." They weren't even taking short hair at that time. The senior executive got fired for cutting her hair.
ED: Oh. And what did they do to designate African Americans?
AH: You didn't have any; who'd ever heard of it? They weren't expected in hotel lobbies, weren't expected to apply for jobs--we had no civil servants! A few who passed for white, and who were white in appearance and were able to get by.
ED: We're in the thirties now, aren't we? The end of the thirties, before the war?﻿Page 64
AH: Yes, '34 just before '35. And the whole situation was intense.
Well anyway, the relief program was developing, emergency relief, not the Department of Welfare yet, Emergency Relief Bureau. And they needed African American supervisors. And I went in as one of the first of those.
ED: Where was the office situated then?
AH: Brownsville.
ED: Which is Brooklyn, isn't it?
AH: It's like saying Mississippi. It was a slum, the big slum area.
ED: Of Brooklyn.
AH: Of Brooklyn. By that time we were living in the Bronx, so I
travelled from the Bronx to Brownsville, and back everyday. And they could have transferred me, but they wouldn't because they said they needed me there. And it was a community of Jews, Italians, and African Americans, and I had the marvelous experience of getting acquainted with Jews whom I had not known. I've always been so glad that I knew the ordinary Jew before I met the Park Avenue crowd. They had--the Italians and the Jews and Negroes, as we said then, were all living in that area. And it was there that I learned, as I said, about Jewish backgrounds. Our supervisor was Merriam Frankelis.
ED: And that's a Jewish name--or Italian?
AH: No, it was Viennese, she was a Viennese. A social worker with
psychiatric training, and she was a whiz. And she taught us about the holidays, and the foods they had on those holidays, and why they had them, and the difference between the conservatives and less conservative Jew. And the meaning of food, and the meaning of the utensils that you worked with. Because we resented it that these Jewish people were coming in and demanding special food, and we were hardly able to get enough of what we called American food, for the rest of the people, you see.
ED: But she explained it to you, the meaning...
AH: She explained it had meaning and it wasn't a whim. And it was during that period...
ED: This was a good grounding for much of the experience that you had later in life in having to work with Jewish people, wasn't it?
AH: Oh yes, yes. And there, of course, we had other people who were
Jewish on the staff. And a good mixture of people, so that it was a very revealing and helpful experience. Also it was the first time I'd ever known people directly who didn't have food and shelter and light and gas and clothing for school kids.
ED: What was your job?
AH: I was a supervisor, and that meant...﻿Page 65
ED: For the people who were giving relief.
AH: 'In the Emergency Relief Bureau; that meant I had supervision over a number of aides, three aides, each of whom had twelve investigators.
ED: Now did they have you supervise only African Americans?
AH: Oh no. They couldn't have. They didn't, and there was no way at that time because there weren't enough of us congregated at a welfare level in the process to make that even feasible. Now of course there was a Harlem District, which was--Vivian Carter Mason was the executive, and that was because it was located here, not because somebody decided, you see. I worked out there for a couple of years, and then learned through the Advisory Committee that we had at that time in Harlem--Advisory Committee on Negro Problems it was called--through that committee that Charlotte E. Carr, who was the commissioner of the Emergency Relief Bureau, was looking for qualified African Americans. This committee recommended three of us: two men and me. I went down for the interview, and Charlotte Carr, I never will forget her, there has to be a talk about all of this. I suppose I should describe her a bit. Do you remember John Lewis, the mine worker?
ED: Yes.
AH: Well, she had that kind of lion head, a lovely head of hair and a
big head. And was a very gracious person. I talked to her, and she said that I was her last interview. She looked at me and she said, "You'd better leave now, I'm likely to hire you on the spot. It's bad enough to be a woman in this world, but to be a Negro woman (she used the term we used then), to be a Negro woman must be pure hell." And the following week I became her assistant. The office was then located on Broadway.
ED: Two-seventy-eight.
AH: No. Nine.
ED: Nine-o-two.
AH: No. Nine-four--I think it was nine. You're right, Merritt, nine-o-two Broadway. Right. And had responsibility for what she called "Consultant on Racial Problems" which meant all racial problems--and the first one ever employed in this town. That was an exciting period because I learned to understand the whole case-work approach, on the one hand, and city-community, on the other hand. And we helped at the time when the hearings machinery was being developed. And unions, hearings machinery for grievances, and learned how you presented them, and what you had to know in order to present a grievance, and what a client, what a staff member had to know. We worked with people like Ellis Ranen, R-A-N-E-N, who was tremendous in that field. And Osmond K. Frankel, the famous lawyer in this town, still, was really the director of the hearings machinery developmental program, and he was tremendous. So I learned about that sort of thing. And also had a lot of experience with trade unions and their efforts to organize in the welfare field.﻿Page 66
ED: Really, only in a city like New York could you have had this kind of broad experience that you have got.
AH: This kind of city.
ED: Because this was where all of this was beginning to happen.
AH: Larger cities do.
ED: Yes. But I mean New York was sort of the pioneer in developing this whole field. Chicago perhaps too.
AH: Chicago definitely.
ED: And it was an exciting time to be involved in the framework of New York City.
AH: For me, it always had been New York because there is such variety. There's "likely to be, as you've just said, more experimentation going on; you don't always know about it, but there's likely to be more. We got the first 150 civil servants appointed provisionally in this town. But resigned from the spot with Charlotte Carr when she left to go to Hull House, to Jane Addams's Hull House, in Chicago, and Hodson, William Hodson, came in as the commissioner, and that was at the time when it was to become the Department Of Welfare. I knew enough from inside to know that there were going to be many provisional appointments, because there were very few people trained to do a welfare job. I knew also that nobody could know it but somebody inside. So I had to come out. I resigned and went to Brooklyn YWCA, this time Ashland Place YWCA, a dump, but a gorgeous building over on Third Avenue which was new then, 30 Third Avenue. From there...
ED: So you became the executive at the Ashland branch.
AH: Yes. And from there, organized the group, which went after the appointments. And we set up machinery...
ED: This is a great story, you've told it to me. Tell it...
AH: We used to meet and plan our strategy. And at one point I figured out that there would be 300 appointments.
ED: How long did you stay as executive of the Ashland branch in Brooklyn?
AH: That's a very fascinating story, and I wish we really had time to explore it, but we don't. What I did there was to use the famous YWCA National Standards Study, with my Committee of Management and the membership to see what kind of setup we ought to have, how we ought to be functioning. And this was so definitive...
ED: How you should be functioning at the Ashland branch?
AH: How all of us should, there. Or in the city for that matter, but we had this sample, so we decided to use this sample. We developed﻿Page 67
that with staff and volunteers, so everyone was conscious of the stakes in an election in the YWCA. I had people coming to the election in the YWCA as you would go to election in a popular period for a popular person. Because they knew what they were trying to do. It had been important to change the branch, to make it really representative, rather than an ownership bit, you see. In Brooklyn, the central Y was inherited, and so was the branch. And the ladies felt they owned it. Now they gave enough volunteer time, the Lord knows, and they sacrificed, but they were too inured in their ways, and they were absolutely unaware of the thing the Eighth Avenue subway had done in New York of bringing all this flood of people in. The best story I know is one of the women said to me one day that she was going to a bridge party. I said, "I hear about this bridge club all the time. Where--who's in it?" She said, "Well, my dear, there's really no need in your asking me who's in it, because you are born into this club." I said, "Well you weren't born in New York." She was from Maine, "Down East," she always said. I said, "Well, you weren't born here." "No, but we've been here such a long time that they've sort of forgotten. But you couldn't possibly get into it." She didn't know that I wanted a bridge club like I wanted a hole in my head. But this was the kind of traditional situation: the chairman had been chairman of the committee of management for years, and she was absolutely determined to rule the roost, and the members had no real say. It was all that sort of thing.
So as I say, once when we had decided we had to have a new chairman, and we had the names on the ballot, and the whole group was prepared, I was sent for by the president of the board, by the executive secretary, who said to me, "The President..." And I answered at once, "That matter is out of my hands. The members and staff have studied the standard study and they know that we need change, and they are prepared to secure change." And I knew that at that moment I had resigned. On the following Tuesday she even sent a representative to our board to say that she did not want change.
E.D: What did they want to change?
A.H: Ways of proceeding, selecting new staff, board members, the president, etc. And we were changing the executive--the chairmanship.
ED: You mean in the. . .
AH: In the branch.
ED: We are continuing the taping of Dr. Anna Arnold Hedgeman, and our
date now, is 1-31-79. And Ann, when we finished the last tape back in December we were talking about your period at the Brooklyn Y, and just heard the wonderful story that you related to us. Could you tell us the dates that you served at the Brooklyn Y as the executive there, the Ashland Street Y?
AH: Yes. From 1939 to 1943, a whole period. It was during that period, as I have recorded, that I used the welfare experience to help secure the appointments of Negroes, as we used the word then, in the whole department.﻿Page 68
ED: You mean the department stores.
AH: The whole Department of Welfare.
ED: Oh, the Department of Welfare.
AH: Still Brooklyn.
ED: Still in Brooklyn.
AH: And I would come to New York and work with the group; we organized men and women to cover the town because we knew that we wanted people from every part of the city to have an opportunity at these employments. These, by the way, were provisional appointments. You see, it had been the habit of the city to make these appointments, and then when later the Civil Service Examination came, you were prepared. Now Negroes who had had any opportunity had had to sort of learn on their own, and hadn't had a chance to go in prepared. And they could be easily eliminated. So we wanted very much to salvage all the previous experience, and at the same time give them that little break in between which would help them know what civil service would be like. See, the Emergency Relief Bureau was not civil service, it was just what it was called, an emergency relief bureau. And, so this was really a training opportunity for many young people.
This dramatized too the way in which Negro women have always had to work. We have carried whatever professional assignment we had, and then done volunteer work. So this was a volunteer job, and in the meantime I was organizing the Brooklyn YWCA which, as the stepchild of the whole association, had many problems. We did not have adequate space for residents. We did not have a clean building yet. We did not have the progressive, younger women active. The older women were marvelous; they were women with great culture, with a good deal of experience, but with traditional attitudes about everything. Therefore they had turned off the younger crowd to a very large extent. So it meant that I had to move out into Brooklyn, into the churches, into the fraternal organizations, into the whole community to begin to be acquainted with the problems.
And discovered almost immediately that Brooklyn had been the bedroom for a great many people who moved into it as newcomers, and the residences, if you please, of many of the very comfortable and wealthy people. And so it meant that the Bedford Stuyvesant area had been a restricted elegant area, one that we would call middle class in these days. Negroes" who were coming in, and they, by the way, increased as the subway went through, the Eighth Avenue subway, took them into Brooklyn. You had all of a sudden an influx of people whose requirements were different, whose hospital needs, for instance, whose general health needs, whose occupational needs were different, that is, the masses of them. And then you had the older Negro who had been there for a long time, some of them were from what they called "Down-East," with all of the provincial attitudes, and all of the snobbery about intelligence that that kind of Negro, or white by the way, brought to the scene.
ED: And you were serving both groups in the Y, or attempting to?﻿Page 69
AH: I was attempting to serve the community; that was supposed to be our charge. We were to serve the community. And since this was a segregated branch, my primary responsibility was to serve the Negro community. Now in addition to that kind of problem, one also had to work on, as we called it, the "white folks" who were running the show. They were on the board of directors, they came to...
ED: Of the Third Street...
AH: Of the central branch.
ED: In Brooklyn.
AH: Our central branch too, only they didn't really know it yet. We were sort of a little missionary project. Now these proud Negro women hated that, but they had much the same kinds of backgrounds that the white board members had. So they made good friends here and there, and very often individual women were pleased with their friendships, and they didn't always struggle as much for the total community as they should have done. So I had to try to...
ED: An oft told story.
AH: Yes.
ED: In Y's across the United States.
AH: Across the whole United States this was the story, North, South,
East and West. And so your executive carried endless responsibility which she might have carried with white people in small towns, but she would not have been expected to carry in a city the size of Brooklyn.
ED: Tell me one thing. The Ashland Street...
AH: Ashland Place.
ED: Was that a former house? You spoke of it being not a clean place and so forth. Was it somebody's home that was turned into the branch?
AH: Yes, yes, it had been a residence. And by the way, the thing that
really added insult to injury was that it was only about five or six blocks, maybe less than five blocks from this Ashland Place branch. So you see how...
ED: What was five blocks from there?
AH: Ashland Place branch was five blocks from Third Avenue! Which was a gorgeous building, described, ironically enough, as a program building. And it was heartbreaking to see that they had all of the services, and all of the relationships that we needed.
Also any mention of change bothered the traditional women, for the simple reason that they had adored their former executive because she had played the social game with the whites, and upper class, so-﻿Page 70
called, Negroes, and they were quite contented. And here comes the suggestion that they ought to reach out to the community. This was not easy for them, and it certainly was difficult for me, because I had begun to know the intimate problems of people who didn't have opportunity of any kind. We didn't have any civil service employees you know, in the city, except a few people who were passing for white. They were white, but I mean in this culture they had to announce themselves as white in order to get their jobs really. So we had some of those, but by and large there was no opportunity, not even for a stenographer in the city of New York.
ED: Hard for people to believe nowadays.
AH: People just don't want to believe that, it doesn't seem possible.
This is what our young people need to know, not because we've come so far--we haven't--but because they need to know what they ought to face now if they are going to achieve for all of us.
ED: We're talking about the year 19--, you said it before.
AH: '39 to'43, that period. Now in the--the National YWCA had what they called a standards study of the whole country, of the administrative practices, and the board of directors' responsibilities and all that. It was a beautiful document. In fact I'm doing some history for the YWCA--by the way, I'm going to say the words out loud. There's another thing I've learned how to research is, that initials are used, and people don't know what they mean. This was the Young Women's Christian Association, and their national scholars had studied the period of the years that they had come. And of course this was a young organization, and they wanted to look at their general administrative practices. And you'll be fascinated--through the student movement, they had really begun to look at the relationship of the Negro. Many of these young people who helped set the pattern were also from the South, white and black.
ED: Out of the student movement.
AH: Out of the student movement.
ED: They've always been the cutting edge.
AH: They were the beginning in the YWCA of the relationship of the Negro to the whole thing. Well, I took the standards study, and tried to figure out where to begin. I had already discovered that we were suffering from the age of some of the women; I laugh now as I think about it. Also from their traditionalism. Negroes have always been more traditional than most people in this country, and that hasn't been understood either. But here where the traditional Negro was very anxious not to rock the boat because their work had been comfortable. They'd learned a great deal, they'd studied together, they liked each other, they had their bridge clubs; life was very comfortable for them, and they lived in comfortable homes. Therefore, how do you bridge the gap and help people discover each other?
The standards study, which had been done by the YWCA itself, helped. I took it for the study document, and then began the development of﻿Page 71
a membership which could respond to it. The membership job took me into the churches, into community centers, into the general community. And of course we were fortunate because Christian is a good word, or it was a good word in our communities generally, and that helped. Also my obvious enthusiasm was something to which people did respond. And so before long I had a good solid membership coming to work on--with the material in the standards study, facing the fact that we were not up-to-date yet. And this challenged some of them, and the newer ones coming in were very excited about the idea of helping run the YWCA. I said it was their job. The Y had always said, you know, that it's the organization of the community.
ED: Right. And that it's a membership-run operation.
AH: And it's a membership thing, a membership right. So we worked on membership like mad. In the meantime, some of our organized separate groups of young people won the business and professional--now we didn't have many strictly business people, or very many professional, at that time, so we also included students, and they were at the same age-level, pretty well. We had a marvelous group of young people. I put them to work too, so that when election time came they would all be knowing why we were voting as we were, what changes we needed, and what needed to be done in the whole community. So we were studying together.
ED: And when you speak of election time you mean city-wide elections.
AH: No, I'm talking about the YWCA's own election for its Committee of Management. And you see from the Committee of Management stemmed all the other committees: the membership committee, the education committee, the girls' work committee, the industrial committee, all the way through. I also set up the industrial committee because there were a good many domestic young people who were not being included properly, and they needed to know more about the factory system and the trade union movement.
ED: Let me ask you, do you have papers on this? Is this covered in some of your writings? Part of it you refer to in one of your books. I don't know whether it's...
AH: I have some materials, but they're in storage. And I don't know when I'll be able to get them out, because I have a five-room apartment filled with other materials, and somehow or another I've got to find a way to get some of those materials.
ED: The reason I ask is, one of the young women of my acquaintance in this area has recently become--a young black woman--the assistant* director of the Brooklyn YWCA, Third Street. And she is very ambitious and very alert and excited. And I know, I'm going to play this part of the tape for her, because I know that she would like to even pull out that standards study and some of the more recent material, and do this kind of organization in the community in Brooklyn even now, and would be thrilled to know that this was what you were doing at the Ashland.
AH: In the meantime we had moved to Brooklyn--﻿Page 72
ED: You and Merritt?
AH: Me, yes, and my husband. By the way I haven't got a husband yet, have I?
ED: Oh yes !
AH: Have I?
ED: Well yes, oh yes, in the tape before this we had the whole meeting of Merritt at the Y, and his mother...
MH: This is strictly YWCA now.
ED: We're on the Y now, right.
AH: My husband always protests, but one of the things that we discovered early in our marriage was that you, if you didn't keep each other informed, then you had all sorts of areas for conflict that you didn't need. And so I always reported it to him at the end of the day and...
ED: So he knows as much about the YW as you.
AH: Right. And almost anything else I've lived with.
ED: And you know about the music.
AH: Oh, he taught me real comprehension of the most significant music
America has, and that's the spiritual. That which we have let them discard for so-called soul-junk. And I'm not talking about real soul music either, by the way,, there is such a thing, but this crowd has been commercialized you see, and they don't have a chance to know it.
ED: Let's get back to Brooklyn.
MH: I'll give you a little history of the Brooklyn Y, from The Trumpet. I think it sets the stage...
ED: Yes, it's from The Trumpet.
AH: The Trumpet Sounds has the best story on the whole Brooklyn YW. I do have what I must find, and that's my position paper as I left there. If I can find that I will...
ED: That's a document maybe we could attach to these tapes.
AH: We might. There're a number of documents I would like you to attach at the end.
ED: Fine, fine. Alright, now let's see, we're at the point now where
we're going to... Let's get up to the leaving of the Y, because we have so much to cover in your life, you know, moving on to FEPC and so forth.﻿Page 73
AH: Well, you see that one of the things that I'm anxious about is to be a bit descriptive--not to be wordy--but because these are significant steps in the way we have come. And I know this from working with Melissa Russell this week on the national YWCA history. They are just beginning to look at themselves broadside. And do you know they have almost nothing on us?
ED: On the Harlem Y?
AH: On the Negro women. Almost nothing.
ED: And there are a few people around still that they could interview, like they did you.
AH: There're a few people to interview. And they should be done
quickly, because they're all older people, they're older than I am. And I know I'm old! So that this is something we have to watch for. For example, they have no material on the very first woman who was in the national YWCA.
ED: And that is?
AH: Eva D. Bowles. They have just nothing about her. And I could give you a list of others that they have not had.
ED: Well, you told this to Mrs. Russell, I'm sure.
AH: Oh yes, yes, and she told me she was really quite shocked, because I made a list of people that I wanted them to fill me in on from their records. Because one has to be very careful not to use material and dates which you cannot confirm, if there is confirmed material available. So that this is actually true, they have no idea of the process through which we had to come. They have—imagine living five blocks, four blocks probably, but five at the most, from the central association. And you remember the same thing was true in Springfield, Ohio, which I talked about. It's the same pattern: the YWCA segregated branch named for the street; they really weren't even wise enough to have named it for some prominent woman which might have given it a little stature at the time. But they didn't know any prominent women really, so there you were. Those people they knew were just very good friends, old acquaintances, pleasant people, and that's about where it was.
Well, on Friday nights my business girls would often meet at our house for coffee. My husband at the time was working in a bank in New York City, one of the first Negroes to ever work in a bank downtown. , And he would share his experiences because they were interested in knowing more about the work world.
ED:	What bank, just for recording purposes.
MH:	Marine Midland.
AH:	Marine Midland Trust Company.
MH:	I don't think that's necessary.﻿Page 74
ED: Well, it's meant for historical purposes.
AH: This is mine, I'll tell you why I'm using it a little bit later.
Business girls would meet us on Friday night, and we'd have coffee and talk. Christmas time came that first year, and they arrived with a little notice that had been placed on the Brooklyn College bulletin board, a notice which said: "Students being accepted for part-time work during the Christmas season." They brought it to me and said, "You see the opportunities vthey' have!?" And of course with us "they" usually has to mean white. "You see the opportunities Nthey' have!?" Well, I don't know what made me say it, but just as quick as a flash I said, "Well, have you applied?" Oh, I'll never forget it! "Oh, Mrs. Hedgeman, be your age. You know they wouldn't take us." I said, "No I don't. You haven't applied." So they decided to apply. And we planned our strategy. We looked the girls over themselves, and suggested that four or five of them go together. We picked types. One of the young women was quite an athletic type, so we said, "We want you to look at sports clothes in the store, and come back and describe what we might wear to attract a sports department's attention." And someone else was to look at the business clothes, and they went right down the line to find four or five things which we could sort of feature. And then we picked different types too. We had a young, blonde girl who could have gone in there and gotten a job any day without any trouble, because she just didn't look, as they think, a Negro should look. So we had this little delegation ready. And the others, of course, were so anxious. Then we said, "Let's discuss the interview."
ED: These were jobs applying for Christmas work in department stores.
AH: For this Christmas work, in the department stores, as a result of
the notice that appeared for all students on the bulletin board, but of course they never thought of it meaning Negro students. This is again part of that whole thing--the assumptions.
So we planned then what we would say when the delegation went. And I tried to think of all the things that might be said to them. "Now the first question they're going to tell you, is that they only have..." Oh, what do you call the domestic jobs in the department...
ED: Housekeeping.
AH: They only have housekeeping kinds of jobs. There's another word they use that's better than housekeeping. Come on, Ellen!
ED: Maintenance.
AH: You're in the field; no, not maintenance.
ED: You mean some more dignified sounding term?
AH: No, they took care of the restrooms, they served, occasionally they were permitted as waitresses, but not often, in the department store restaurant.﻿Page 75
ED: Non-selling, operating jobs.
AH: They serviced...
ED: Non-selling.
AH: Yes, operating kinds of jobs. They served as sometimes an aide in putting clothes in the stockroom, in arranging them on the shelves, this sort of almost...
ED: Stock.
AH: Stock girls but more general than that. But anyway they were part of this kind of staff. Maids was the common word. And I said, "Suppose they tell you, 'We don't have any vacancies for maids.'"
ED: Matrons. Maids and matrons.
AH: No, maids, just maids. "Suppose they tell you, they don't have any opening for maids at this time." One little girl bristles up to it, "I'll tell them I don't need a maid's job and don't want one!" I said, "No you won't. Those maids jobs are the only ones open now, and we need them as Negroes in this town. What you will say is you understand they have some excellent maids, but you're interested in sales, and the sales opportunity. Then show them the Brooklyn College statement about the openings which were there."
Well, the personnel man of course was flabbergasted. They actually went and carried it all out, and it went almost as though I had described what had happened. And I haven't given you all the details because we'd take too much time. But, they went for the interview, and Cary'd answered--he asked the questions that they had expected, and they were prepared. One of them said, "Well, I'll tell you, I'd like to work in your sports department, I like sports clothes." And she looked like a sports model when she described what she liked--how she'd like to change their department. Each one of them had their little story ready. Well, the poor personnel man didn't know what to do, he just had to tell them frankly that they didn't take Negroes for those jobs.
So they came back. "We told you that they wouldn't hire us." All the rest who hadn't gone were there, you see--I had about thirty-five girls involved. I said, "But how many times have you been there to apply?" "Oh, just once." "I don't know anybody who ever got anything with one try. We want you to go back, again and again. Sometimes individually, sometimes collectively, but always prepared with enough knowledge of the store, enough knowledge of its needs, to apply specifically if you can. And by the way, some of those maids working in there will be able to give you a lot of tips. They've been around the place a long time, and they know more than you realize, and more than the store knows. So maybe you take one of them out to lunch."
ED: Oh, I've talked to some in Altman's who're now in their thirtieth year.
AH: And you know what I'm saying?﻿Page 76
ED: Yes, and came in 1943.
AH: They hadn't been used to using them, you see, so they didn't think of this. And by the way, this always intrigues me, because one of the things we have not done sufficiently, even yet, is to use accumulated experience adequately. But in the meantime I got a big break; I was working for the Church Women of the City of New York and Mrs. Allan Knight Chalmers was the chairman at that time, a very imaginative and thoughtful white woman. And the council itself was beginning to be integrated. More and more of our church women would join. They hated to join it mostly because in their experience they'd had to spend all their time struggling instead of creating, you know? But, so we had to urge them to go.
Those women were talking about race, and one of my good friends, Nora Jiles Hill, out of Harlem, was on the board along with Mrs. Chalmers, and they were great friends. So they asked me to come and talk about the problems of young women in the city of New York--young, Negro women concerned with employment. I prepared my speech, and then all of a sudden I said to them myself, "Why don't I take the girls and let them tell their own story?" So I took four of them: the fair one I mentioned; the dark brown one who was just as sharp as she could be and as quiet as she could be; and in between a couple of sparkly people. That sort of thing, all colors. I took them to the meeting, and explained that I had prepared a speech, but it had occurred to me they'd like to hear directly from the young people involved, since the Young Women's Christian Association has a special interest in young people. Hear directly what they had lived through.
ED: Was this your Brooklyn board, Mrs. Chalmers, or National?
AH: No, she was the city-wide chairman, yes, and this was back in that same era.
ED: City-wide. It comes out of New York City then.
AH: This was a city-wide group. And therefore these girls were their legitimate responsibility. And that's why they'd wanted me to do it. So the girls went, and they were just superb. They had those very comfortable, many wealthy, white women in tears, because they could see young people who were the ages of their young people having this problem in terms of everything else. And they began the campaign in the department stores. They had a-meeting, and they agreed that most of them had expense accounts of varying sizes...
ED: Charge accounts.
AH: Charge accounts in all these stores, and spent, some of them several thousand dollars a month on different kinds of items. And they organized a group of women to go to the personnel directors of the department stores in New York City. And they did it.
The first question they asked me was, "Should we take a Negro with us?" I said, "By all means! Because Negro women have charge accounts too; and they need to know that. They need to know the﻿Page 77
normalcy of them in relationship to United States living." And that was the first big move. Now it does not mean that Urban League and NAACP and other organizations were not working on this too. They probably were, I didn't always know that. But this was the real beginning of using financial pressure to open up job opportunities. They would go in and say, "We want to see an integrated group of salespeople here in your store." And then say, "And if we don't find one soon, we're really going to have to withdraw our accounts." Straight economic pressure.
ED: I'm sure Altman's was one of the stores affected because I think the first black saleswoman hired in Altman's was in 1943, so this would be just in this period. It was prior to the passage of FEPC, I remember that.
AH: Oh, this was prior to that! There was no FEPC, no way you could bring any national pressure except through your own national organizations. But this was the first time I knew of an integrated group of us going after a central community.
ED: That's a wonderful strategy. Wonderful.
AH: I know Altman's would have been one of the stores--by the way, I
think it's important to say at this point that you've been at--how long have you been at Altman's?
ED: Twenty-seven years.
AH: Twenty-seven years. This is one of the products only--I don't mean you personally--but that era made possible many of the kinds of jobs that are open. The other day I ran into a young woman who looked interesting, and I wondered what she did. She said, "I'm a buyer," and mentioned the department store. I thought to myself if she just knew the whole story it would even give her a different approach to the job she's on. This is one of the things we must begin to do.
ED: One of the implications, the factors in my hiring was that FEPC had been passed, and a woman had brought suit against Altman's for not being hired. And my father, who had then left the YMCA and was working with the State Commission Against Discrimination--SCAD--he was assigned to handle her case. And in talking with the personnel director, she not only proved that this woman had not been hired because of race, she was not hired because of size, which now would be discriminatory. But she had applied as a waitress in the Charleston Garden, and the aisles were very narrow.
The story I was telling was of the hiring of the woman who was not hired as a waitress. And my father, with the State Commission Against Discrimination--SCAD, was assigned to the case. He went down and talked with the personnel director, Grace Bamonte, who said to him, "We are looking for Negro women and men." Naturally she put in the term "qualified" and all the other things that one had to say. He came home and said, "Why don't you go down and try to get a job at Altman's?"
AH: That's how you had to go?﻿Page 78
ED: Yes! And I went down and I never mentioned his name, which she
later told me that she resented very much. I just went down on my own.
AH: She resented it?
ED: She said that I should have told her, and I said you might have
hired me because I was my father's daughter; I didn't want that. So I went down and applied, and she had an opening in the training department, which is part of personnel. And her idea was that by placing a black person in that job, the newly hired people would have their first contact, and that would set the ground for understanding that Altman's was attempting to comply with the law. You see, this was after the passage of the...
AH: After the passage of the bill.
ED: Yes, and we must again define FEPC: Federal Employment Practices Act, right?
AH: Yes. Federal Employment Practices Act.
ED: What's the "C" in FEPC?
AH: Commission.
ED: Commission, right. And what was the act called? Well, we'll get to it when we get to your part. Okay, but that's just that part of the story.
AH: One of the interesting studies that ought to come, even now, is a whole history of the Negro relationship to civil service. Many times people were employed whom nobody knew about, bringing up a point just made by your friend here.
ED: Yes, Sinah Kelley is sitting in on this interview with us.
AH: Many times there were spots where people worked. Very often they were not civil service, but spots they had gained through friends who had helped them get in. They were not expected to tell anybody very much about it, because there might be other applications, which they didn't want to encourage. So there is the possibility of some of that, that ought to be explored. Young people are looking for studies these days, that might well be one.
ED: Yes, you're right, that would be an excellent study to make. Sinah Kelley, come over a minute. Let's raise the question that you were raising, just very quickly. Sinah Kelley is a 1938 graduate. S-I-N-A-H. Estelle, named for her grandmother, who was Estelle Caution. And what did Grandma Caution do?
SK: Head of the...
ED: Katy Ferguson.
SK: Katy Ferguson Home for Unmarried Mothers, on 130th Street, between 7th--oh, east of 7th Avenue.﻿Page 79
AH: And one of our pioneer institutions in Harlem, a real pioneer group.
ED: Right. So Sinah's middle name is Estelle, last name Kelley, K-E-L-L-E-Y.
AH: And here, again, is important history: I knew her father.
ED: William Kelley.
AH: William Kelley. He was editor--and really publisher—practically he was the Amsterdam News.
ED: Right. What years was that, Sinah, do you recall?
AH: She's having trouble.
SK: Up to--I can't remember the starting date. I would say the early twenties, or mid-twenties.
ED: That he started.
SK: Yes.
ED: And was editor until...
SK: Up to 193-.. . about 1933, approximately.
AH: It would have had to have been before that because I knew him during that period. I would suggest to you before you say one word that you begin writing some of the history that's in you.
ED: I have asked her this many times. And I think we ought to mention here for historical purposes, and the story of Harlem, Sinah, your mother, Gladys Caution Kelley, whose work was...
SK: During the intermission I was mentioning that my mother had worked--I thought, in civil service. What Mrs. Hedgeman has said might be true, because I know the job was partly political, but she worked as a playground leader in the Brooklyn playgrounds. She worked first as a teacher. I don't want to give all her history, but she was a teacher in New York at a school back of John Wanamaker, which was predominantly Italian at that time.
ED: Down on 8th St. She was a civil service teacher?
SK: Well, I would have to check the records.
ED: Right. So first a teacher, and then when...
SK: She was not in that very long, and then she went as a playground leader in the parks in Brooklyn. And then became a probation officer in the Children's Court, which is now the infamous Family Court.
ED: Right. So that would be about what year that your mother became a probation offficer? Probably in the thirties, wouldn't it?﻿Page 80
SK: I don't have the date. In the thirties. And maybe late twenties, but I really can't... Well, I can figure: 1922, we moved back into New York, because I went to school in New York. We were living in Brooklyn before that. She was a playground leader, I believe, and I'm talking about...
ED: So a probation officer in the late twenties, early thirties.
SK: In the mid to late twenties.
ED: Okay, I think this is important.
AH: It's very important, but it's important for her to dig out this history and to put it in black and white.
ED: I have been asking her this for many years.
AH: Now I say that because remember, I am reporting on what I lived through. It is still not easy to do two things: to produce selectively significant material on the one hand, and to be very sure of your dates on the other. That's the reason I've written down all these dates here. I am sure that I may have missed a year here and there. I don't think so, because I worked them out very carefully. But it takes time.
ED: And if one is reluctant to write this then one can sit down with a tape recorder and talk what you remember.
SK: I probably have, for instance, her appointment. And if she was not civil service, it became civil service. I probably have that.
AH: Now there were some people who had pull, as we say in the political world, who got appointments through that relationship, and didn't want anybody to know just how they got them because there might be competition which they could not afford to allow.
ED: Right, understandable.
AH: Yes. And then the other problem was serious too. They were never sure of their status unless they were absolutely civil service, and even then they had to fight for it. Because some of the development — that was the problem, you see, getting from the Emergency Relief Bureau to the Department of Welfare, that these provisional appointments would make us qualified. I would be grateful if you checked out--because I'm doing some writing about women--if you would check out any dates that you find, and set up your own family story. How dare you have all this information, and not try to share it, because White America has had no chance to know it all. Neither has Negro America because we've all gone to the same schools. And none of them are informed on anything much but North Europe.
ED: That's right, so it's really an obligation.﻿Page 81
AH: Even the South European was handicapped by the same thing. So I hold you responsible for any mistakes that come in this period, [all laugh]
ED: Okay. Now, Ann.
SK: Excuse my interruption.
ED: No, it is not an interruption, it's something we wanted.
AH: If it gets you busy,- it was worth it.
ED: Right. Ann, I have so many notes here that I want to make sure of, so we get into the story. So we aren't--have we left the Brooklyn Y?
AH: No, we haven11.
ED: I want that story, the leaving of the Brooklyn Y.
AH: All right. You understand that we were training our community and our board and committee for women in terms of the standards study, because it opened up all the kinds of questions that needed to be reviewed: how you employ, what your personnel is like, what their abilities are, what committee responsibilities are for every committee we set up.
ED: I've often heard that study referred to in later years as a great study.
AH: Yes, it was really a great and fundamental one. So that, about that time, we were due to have elections in the YWCA. They had never had a democratic ballot. And yet the standards study talked about the democratic ballot. I'm trying to get a copy of the standards study, incidentally, but haven't got my hands on it yet. The election, then, we were to have a democratic ticket. Well, the chairman of the branch had been chairman for something like twenty years, and she didn't understand why she needed a second person running, and we said, "But you see we have to have a ballot which gives people a choice." Well, she wasn't used to being a choice. She had inherited the branch just as the white women had inherited the central association. And there were women on that central board you couldn't displace. You might shift their responsibilities occasionally, but you didn't displace them. They had inherited the YWCA, and their children did. And so our branch was the same thing. They inherited this. So we had quite a struggle. We did develop a democratic ballot: two people for every office.
ED: Instead of the single slate.
AH: Instead of just the single slate, which was approved by the
nominating committee and presented, and you voted for it but it was no vote at all. So we presented a democratic slate, and the war was on. Everybody was upset. Those we had trained were ready, and on election day, those women came in as though they were going to the city polls to vote for governor. And they knew who they wanted to﻿Page 82
vote for, they had discussed them. Just before the election, my executive sent for me and said...
ED: Pardon me, tell me, if this ballot was for city or for...
AH: No, for the branch! For our own committee of management and our own leadership in that branch. There wasn't even the suggestion then of a representative on the central board. I have, I think if I checked carefully, the chairman of our branch may have been asked in occasionally, or may even have served. But if she did--and I don't believe it--but if she did, you had no real carry-through, you see, to the branch. So this was our own election. The executive director sent for me and said, "Ann, I want you to know that the president does not think there ought to be a change in leadership in the branch at this time." And I said, "I'm sorry but I have no control of that. The members are at work, and they will make the determinati on." And at that moment I knew that X had written my resignation. That was on a Tuesday, and the following Monday was the election. And they even sent a member of the board who sort of intimidated those who were used to listening to them, and that member of the board made a little statement about the importance of continuity in leadership. But the vote came and the change came. And there was tremendous trauma. Understandable, but the change had to come if the association was to grow. I went home that night, and I don't know whether my husband will remember this or not, but I told him I'd just written my resignation from the Ashland Place branch of the YWCA. He said, "You mean you wrote it?" I said, "Yes, it's written. I haven't put it in black and white yet. But I wrote it when I indicated that there could not be a decision on change made by the central board of director's president."
I think, the day of the election, the change was clear. And I went home to write out the resignation, and my husband, at the time, was employed, as I said to you, in the bank. The president of the bank had relationships with my president of the YWCA of Brooklyn. So both of our jobs were in jeopardy, and his was a purchasing agent responsibility, which was really responsible, and paid money which we needed. Both of us found that living as we lived meant two salaries, and my salary was not very big, and I didn't get promotions at the branch because I was only representing a section of the association, although I had to do everything that was done in the central branch, and some more. We had a big caucus to decide what to do. It might have meant that he was out of a job, and that was serious. And it meant definitely that I was, and I had nothing else in mind.
So we sent for an application for the Department of Welfare, looked at it, and decided that we could live, even though it would be difficult, on the welfare budget. And we hung that budget on our curtain and called it our declaration of independence. And on that Friday I met with the YWCA group and explained that I represented change, and I represented radical change, and though it was within the standards study of the Young Women's Christian Association itself, that change was so painful that it meant there'd be a cleavage in the YWCA if I stayed, so I resigned.﻿Page 83
I found later that they had planned to dismiss me. I didn't think of that, that they had planned to dismiss me. And a friend of mine in the national YWCA knew about us: Isabel Lawson, she was a national worker.
ED: Now Isabel Lawson Sealey.
AH: And she tipped me off, which really saved me, in my mind. Saved me because I knew that I had done the right thing, and that I was very happy that they had not had the privilege of releasing me.
In the meantime I had held a civilian defense meeting for the women, as part of the educational program, because the war was on, and we knew that they might be having to help in community life in connection with the war. Crystal Bird Fauset had just been appointed to the national civilian defense program; in other words, she was federal, and responsible for recruiting people. She came to the meeting I had as the speaker. This was before I resigned, the week before I resigned from Ashland Place YWCA. The response of the women was so exciting to her that we talked afterwards, and she asked me if I would be willing to work with civilian defense. So my resignation from Brooklyn met her request. And by January of 19--, what was it, '44, January first, I was employed by the civilian defense program.
ED: The Office of Civilian Defense.
AH: Yes.
ED: OCD. What was the title?
AH: I was a regional representative, which meant New York, New Jersey, and Delaware.
ED:	Was this a federal appointment?
AH:	Federal, with headquarters here in New York.
ED:	And did Merritt's job remain?
AH:	No, he remained until he went to the service.
ED:	No, I mean it wasn't affected by this.
AH:	Well, no. He went into the service almost immediately.
ED:	What branch of the service?
AH:	When did you go into the service?
MH:	Forty-three.
AH:	He went into the service, you see, in '43, and I went to the
Civilian Defense January '44. So we both made changes at that period.
ED:	What branch of the service?﻿Page 84
MH: I was in the Air Force, Special Services.
ED: Special Services, oh yes, with his talent, I remember the artists that entered that area.
AH: And that, too, was a very difficult period, you see, because our forces were segregated. And in addition to the segregation they were sent South, for the most part, for training.
ED: This is another area for research and study by some of our young people.
AH: Oh, yes, and there are great--and they ought to know that right now, because we are in such threat of military action again, you see, all over the world.
At that time the civilian defense program was fairly new. In fact, I believe that Crystal Fauset, Crystal Bird Fauset, whom I had known as a national Girl Reserve secretary during my YWCA days, who had come to visit me at Springfield, Ohio, and helped me develop a program there. And whom I admired tremendously. She was a Boston girl, and a very attractive personality.
ED: She was my mother's best friend.
AH: Oh really? Well, she was as beautiful as your mother was. I
remember your mother, in a very different way. Your mother was much more really physically beautiful, but Crystal had a kind of ethereal quality. She was not as ethereal as she could look, but she did have that quality.
ED: That inner beauty.
AH: And she'd stand and talk with people, and she always had a way of casting her eyes heavenward, you know. And I'd practice in my mirror to see if I couldn't make myself look as ethereal as she did, at those moments. [laughter]
ED: She was angelic.
AH: Yes, and dressed very simply and I kind of admired that. So, I had known her previously, and to have her ask me whether I'd be interested in working in the region, from her, really as her representative also, was a very exciting moment.
ED: Was her assignment to cover the country, was it a national assignment?
AH: Hers was a national assignment.
ED: What was her title, do you happen to remember?
AH: I haven't clearly, I think she was an assistant, but I'm not sure enough of her title to want to quote it. Mary McLeod Bethune was the top Negro in the set-up in Washington. And Mrs. Bethune, as you remember, was very close to Mrs. Roosevelt, and had political﻿Page 85
entrees that were important. And of course she'd also had a long history of organization of women and communities. So she became the top person there but...
ED: She wasn't director, was she, of civilian defense?
AH: No, no. A top Negro. See, we never get the top spot. And that's
one of the reasons I've always intended to run for the presidency of the United States, just to sort of indicate clearly that I felt ready for a top spot in the country. And that's almost the only way you'd ever get to be the top person in most organizations. At that time, people just didn't even think of it, so that was that.
In the region, Mary Pillsbury Lord was the top, the assistant executive. They'd sort of set it up "man/woman" as usual. And the man was the president of New York Life Insurance Company, and Mary Pillsbury Lord was his assistant. They didn't say it that way.
ED: It was sexism. We were talking about racism first, now sexism, where the man gets to be the leader.
AH: Not now,- sexism is always with us.
ED: Yes. No, but I mean formerly we were saying you couldn't do it because you were black, but as far as women are concerned you couldn't be the head.
AH: That's right.
ED: You had to be the assistant.
AH: You had to be the assistant, and you were lucky to be the assistant. You might be third or fourth down. Even in the YWCA the boards of directors usually carried out their major financial obligations through the. husbands of the board women.
ED: And the board of trustees.
AH: And the board of trustees was almost always predominantly the most prominent male financial people they could find in a given community. So that whole thing was the same.
Well, I was given an appointment with Mary Pillsbury Lord. I went to talk with her and found that she was a very pleasant, thoughtful woman. I was intrigued because she was a Pillsbury from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
ED: Is that the flour people?
AH: That's the flour people. And since I came from Anoka, Minnesota, eighteen miles away from where Mary lived, we really rather hit it off at once. We had so much in common out of our own common experience. Of course she had varied financial relationships, as you well know. But anyway, there was an immediate bond and we got along very well. However, they were not very much upset about having a Negro on staff in the region. And I think Mary was not, as﻿Page 86
I knew her later) but certainly the men were. And this man in particular who had more power than anybody else. And they kept me waiting, I think, three or four days before they finally confirmed the appointment.
ED: Well, you were not only a Negro, you were a woman. So you had two strikes...
AH: No, the woman part of it was not, at that point. It was the
business of Negro. And they had conferred with Washington, and of course Crystal was perfect for handling such a matter. She had all of the--both charm and the toughness needed. And really, you see, it was her recommended appointment, and she wasn't about to take any question on it. So in the three-day period I was finally admitted to my office. I had a nice office. And it was a good staff on the whole, and I found it very pleasant. Except, of course, again immediately the problems which centered around race came to me in spite of my regional title. So that again I was working two ways: helping in every way, communities as a whole, whites and all the rest, but also with this special responsibility.
Well, one short sample of that came when a young man, who was a chemist--I'm trying desperately to think of his name. His father was a dentist in Brooklyn, and had sent him to tell me his story. He was a chemist with excellent credentials, and he wanted very much to get into the chemical end of the whole defense program, because, you see, they were training people to take care of themselves, and part of it was the necessity to know a good deal about the whole chemical warfare bit. He had applied, and they had told him there were no vacancies; and his father knew better. The morning he came to me, I had just listened to a radio broadcast calling for chemists to make application. So I took advantage of my position, and called the headquarters of this situation in Jersey, and said, "I hear you're wanting chemists at this time for the Civilian Defense Program for the development of care of ourselves in war and all that sort of thing. Are you still open for such employees?" "Oh yes!" And he went on to delineate his many needs. Then I took out a piece of stationery with the Civilian Defense title of course and with my title, and wrote a letter saying, "I am sending you," and gave the man's name and his credentials, "in light of your conversation with me this morning. I do hope you will have the privilege of his services. He is a very distinguished citizen of Brooklyn, New York. He has the following credentials," put all in black-and-white. And he got the job. And the same man who had rejected him had to take him. Of course there'd been new openings, he said. Because I had coached him not to say anything, to just present the letter. And he did that, and came back grinning to say that he had been employed, and was pleased that it was by the same man who had previously rejected him. That made me know I had to watch everything as usual.
In the meantime the regional directors had real responsibility across the board. There are many incidents one could tell but I use a couple to dramatize the kinds of situations. I went into Wilmington, Delaware, 'cause Delaware, New York, and New Jersey were part of my whole territory. I went into Delaware to help in the development of the program and Negroes came to me privately. We﻿Page 87
always had caucuses. The young people think this Black Caucus idea is new with them, but we always had to have caucuses.
ED: The "network" we used to call it.
AH: The network, exactly. And the women in Wilmington, Delaware, took me aside and said, "The Red Cross is taking our blood but throwing it away." And I said, "Do you know that?" They said, "Yes, we've just finished a protest, and they promised not to do it again." Well, I couldn't believe that, I'd heard most of the horrible things about this country, but I couldn't believe that with the need of blood in the field that they would have thrown it away. So I went to the meeting prepared and, I'll never forget it, there must have been two or three Negroes there, the rest white. And we talked about the whole blood program and its importance to the field. And then I said, "I have been informed, and I'd really like to have it cleared up, that Negro blood has been thrown away in this town. Could that possibly be true?" And this nice sort of white woman looked at me and said, "Oh, but we've changed, we don't do that anymore."
ED: As of that moment.
AH: And she didn't realize that she had verified the fact that they did it.
In the meantime, also, I was working a bit in South Jersey, and one of the leaders of the South Jersey community said, "I don't know why we should be involved in this white man's war. I have just had the experience of having a" cross burned on my lawn, because I bought a house in a neighborhood which had decided that they would have no Negroes. This in the United States, and this is a war for democracy." So I had that kind of feeling to meet in the field.
And then up in New York state a group of people had this big mass meeting. I had worked hard to get a number of Negroes out so that it would be a city mass meeting, and not just one more meeting. Everything was going very well, and the leading physician got up to make an announcement. And he said, "We have some very interesting health programs going, and I'm very proud of them. Our little pickaninnies are being taken care of in a way that is very helpful." I had to follow this, and I said--among other things-- that we didn't call our children pickaninnies. They were babies.
To repeat, we don't call our children pickaninnies, they're babies--little American babies. After the meeting, some of the white citizens and even one or two Negro citizens commented that I was a bit cruel to him. He was an old citizen in the community, and the Negroes said, "...and he's always been so gracious to Negroes." I could understand that, because I knew by this time that in most communities there were only a few people who even heard Negroes, and so I understood it. But I said to them we had to make it clear that our babies are babies too. And so the discussion was really very interesting because the white people were just plain indignant. This worried the Negroes too, because they would later have to deal with those same white people, and since those white people were the most liberal ones around town, they had their worries. And I was so﻿Page 88
glad that I had lived in this horrible race situation in this country long enough to understand that, so that I was neither hurt nor embarrassed, nor angry because of the reactions.
ED: So those were the kinds of experiences...
AH: So these were the kinds of experiences, getting local communities to open up the facilities which should be available to everybody. And they were talking at that time about the underground shelters, and no plans were being made to include the Negro community. We had to clear all of that, had to talk with the	about the fact
that a soldier needed blood, and that there was no difference in blood, it was a matter of type. And that the races share the types of blood. I mean you went around talking about that kind of thing all the time. Both across this New York State--and I was a little surprised, I thought maybe New York State would be different--but it was the same all the way up the state, even on university campuses.
ED: How long did you remain with the Office of Civilian Defense?
AH: Not too long. What happened was, the climax of it--my real concern came when I had to face the horrible segregation of the Negro soldier, what it had meant. Had to visit my husband in the Armed Services in North Carolina, in Greensboro yet, a good-sized town, where he couldn't even take me to dinner. And friends--and oh, someday somebody must write the story of the Negroes and the way we protected each other when we were travelling. One man and wife there turned over their home to us so that we could spend the weekend together. This kind of thing happened all the time. You never knew what was going to happen. And the fact that a soldier in the United States Army, supposedly being trained for us to fight for democracy, couldn't eat in a restaurant was just horrible to bear. The final straw came, though, when our staff was expected to do some training. And the training was going to be at Amherst College, and I was very excited about it, because Amherst was in the area where I assumed always that people were both intellectual and gracious. I'd been taught a lot about the culture of the East, you know. And of course, too. . .
ED: Amherst is located?
AH: What's our lawyer?
ED: Dingle?
AH: Charles Houston, the famous NAACP lawyer who helped set up Howard University Law School, had been a student there, so I was doubly excited about the idea since I admired Charles Houston so much.
ED:	Now Amherst is located...?
AH:	Now where is Amherst?
ED:	In Massachusetts.
AH:	Yes, I know, but I ought to say it.﻿Page 89
ED: Is it Amherst, Massachusetts? Springfield? No... Well, we have located the fact that it's in Massachusetts.
AH: Amherst is one of the Big Ten, one of the more exciting colleges. I registered first before other members on our staff. East Hadley is at... I'm not sure. I always get confused between Holyoke--I guess it's East Hadley, Amherst is something else. Anyway. The college is located and is so famous that you can find that easily for me. The staff...
ED: You registered first.
AH: Our staff was to go, and I was the first one to register. When the announcement of our leaving date came, I was called into the office to say that the inn at Amherst which was to service everybody--the Lord Jeffery--would not take Negroes. Well, I really was flabbergasted, and I complained bitterly of course, and Mary Pillsbury Lord was disgusted and angry about it. She said, "I tell you, I want you to talk with the chairman"--who was the New York Life Insurance Company president--"in his office." So I went to his office. And I told him that as a member of the staff, I expected exactly the same treatment that anyone else would have, that I was a federal employee, and discussed again the war and its relationship to all of this, that I needed and wanted the training, and that it was ridiculous to think that I could not stay in the same place that anybody else stayed who was a member of staff. He looked me dead in the eye and said, "Do you know I can't understand why Negroes and Jews always want to be where they aren't wanted." Just like that. Pleasantly, but just as cold as that. So I said that Negroes and Jews, I presumed too, were tired of being robbed of that which was due them; that we asked the federal government to give us the same attention and service that anyone else received. So he said, "Well, I don't know., I'll have to see what I can do about it." I said, "Well I'm not going unless the service is open to me as it is to every other staff member." I went back to my desk, hot, sick, and angry. What did you do about a thing like this? So I wrote it all down, as it had happened, and waited.
The day before we were to go I was informed that everything had been cleared up, and they hoped I would go. So I decided to go up there and see what "cleared up" meant, because I had found that the English language had totally different meanings for white folks. Especially in a crucial situation like that. When I arrived at the campus, we were directed to an official of the Army for registration, just off the campus. I went in, had a very cordial interview, and was handed my registration form. I went into the Lord Jeffery Inn and up to the desk which was just to the left of the lobby. When I reached the desk, the register was in front of the clerk. He turned it toward me, then pulled it back, and I looked at him and said, "Well, make up your mind." I thought it was some more difficulty, and it was. He then turned it and permitted me to register. Tapped his bell, call the bellhop, and the bellhop took me across the street to a private residence. And I sat in that room trying to figure out what to do, and I called the Jewish member of our staff, and asked her to come over to the residence, and told her what had happened. And in the coolest manner possible, she﻿Page 90
said, "Do you know, this is too bad, but maybe this is your contribution to the war effort."
ED: Had they registered her in the hotel?
AH: Oh yes, she was registered in the hotel.
ED: It was not anti-Semitism.
AH: Well there was, but she didn't know it at that time. And they
probably had changed somewhat because... Now I had two problems. I was not staying, I knew that, unless they put me in the Lord Jeffery, that was number one. But the second thing was that I did not want to embarrass this white woman who had taken me in, and was my hostess. It happened that I'd been asked whether I knew any Negroes near the college, and I had said I knew no one there and I would not be interested in finding anyone there, because I knew what they were up to. Now this white woman had opened her doors, and they would think of her as very liberal and wonderful. I didn't want her hurt, but I could not stay.
So I went downstairs, my bedroom was upstairs, went downstairs to see my hostess. And she said, "Oh, I'm so glad you're the kind of person you are. I've been worried about this thing all day. I didn't want you not to have a place to stay, but I was angry at what happened. Did you know I used to work on the switchboard at the Lord Jeffery, and I was instructed as a switchboard operator not to register Jews, and that I would know them by the fact that they seldom had middle initials."
ED: Oh, dear.
AH: So then I knew I was right to go back.
ED: Wasn't it wonderful she was that person.
AH: ... that real. She took me for dinner and put me on a train back to New York. When I showed up in my office in New York City everybody was flabbergasted, they walked around me like a red-hot potato. I made a formal report, and never had an answer. And I "stayed through. In the meantime, we were then in the Empire State...
ED: What do you mean you stayed through?
AH: Stayed on staff. In the meantime...
ED: No one said anything to you about why you weren't there?
AH: They knew. I sent my report through. There was no question. When I came back they knew, too.
ED: But no comment when those who went up there to the training returned.
AH: Those who went up, no, they never discussed it. I sent through my written report. I did talk with Mary Pillsbury Lord about it. She understood perfectly and agreed with me that under those﻿Page 91
circumstances, I couldn't stay. And was particularly annoyed by the fact that the Jewish person could, because she had worked very hard to get more Jews involved in the program. So it had a double edge for her.
We had moved from the Chrysler building to the Empire State, and one morning I had a phone call from A. Philip Randolph asking whether I could see him. It was a snowy cold day, I'll never forget it. He came down to my office and asked me if I would be willing to be executive director of the National Council for a Permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission. He said that men were in the Army; they were being segregated; they were being mistreated in every possible way. Refugees coming in from Army camps, who were really prisoners, were given opportunities to eat in restaurants and to move about freely, and our soldiers were not. He went into the whole thing in great detail and he said, "We've decided that the Fair Employment Practices Commission established as a temporary commission in Washington ought to be continued, and therefore it would be important to have legislation continuing it." Well, here I was, I was concerned about both ideas because we had the same problems that every other Negro had in the country, and I had experienced the whole thing. So I told him that I was interested, but I had to see about it because this Civilian Defense program was a war program. I didn't know whether they were releasing me or not. I did have a series of meetings. They did not want to release me because I knew the whole area by this time, but did agree. And I made a final report telling the whole story, all of the complications, and indicating some of the areas which needed to be further developed and designed. About the same time a group of citizens in New York wanted me to take on the Human Rights Commission for the city.
ED: But didn't they call that--oh yes, they called it Human Rights.
AH: It was Human Rights. I didn't want to do that, because that's what I had been involved in across the town and across the three states, and I knew that something had to happen federally. And so I accepted the job in Washington.
ED: I didn't know that. Much as I know about you.
AH: No. We had a board, and Mr. Randolph, and Allan Knight Chalmers— the husband of the woman we talked about with the church women in New York--the two of them were the co-chairmen. And we had a very distinguished board which was responsible for general development of policy. I did not know much about legislative process except what one learns in school, in political science. But I had not worked with it in great detail. I had done bits and pieces of support of legislation, so that I knew that there was the Democratic and Republican party consideration and all of that.
ED: Hold it just one moment.
AH: I was green enough to assume that we could accomplish fair
employment practice legislation in a minimum time, maybe a year. With the country winding up the war, with the coming home of the soldiers, everyone, it seemed to me, would be at least interested in﻿Page 92
fair employment practices. It seemed to me that was the least common denominator which one could use in appealing to the American people. And surely it wouldn't take longer than a year. Actually I didn't want to be away from New York City, which I loved. I think if my husband had not been coming out of the army very shortly, I probably would not have accepted it. But anyway, here I was in Washington with a minimum budget, but a good one, with the responsibility for locating an office. Again I was shocked--the capital of my nation, I had incredible difficulty in trying to find office space reasonably near the national Capitol and in the central part of the city. Finally, through a friend of ours--and this is an interesting story, Benjamin Marsh and Morris Milgram. I think I'd better mention Morris Milgram first, because I had been on the board of the Workers Defense League here in New York City, one of my activities. And Morris Milgram was the executive director. A very alert, dedicated human being who really cared about people, and about ideas, and about making them function. And as you know, in later years, he's made a tremendous contribution to the housing discrimination field.
ED: That's what I think of his name as, yes.
AH: That's right, that's what he has been for a number of years.
ED: He's still living, isn't he?
AH: Oh yes. He's done a superb job. But he, for his organization, had an office in a building on 14th Street in Washington. And when he heard about our difficulties in finding an office--and of course I had reported it to our board--he called and offered us the subletting of his office, the Workers' Defense League Office, in that building. And that was very helpful. It was not a huge space, but it was there. And we were known, we were free to use it.
ED: Under what branch of the government did you...?
AH: No, this was not government.
ED: This was federal!
AH: This was not federal, this was private. A. Philip Randolph was the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, I should have said that, and Allan Knight Chalmers was then, the Minister of the--they called it then--Broadway Tabernacle, later it was the Broadway Congregational Church.
ED: Right, I see. So this was a group of...
AH: Private organizations with labor represented because of Mr. Randolph.
ED: But you were salaried.
AH: I was the salaried executive director.
ED: Who was paying you?﻿Page 93
AH: The commission itself, the committee, board group, assumed responsibility for...
ED: From private funds.
AH: From private funds. They got funds from the trade union movement because of Mr. Randolph's connection with it. They got funds from other groups. But the trade movement essentially, with its history of segregation and discrimination, had a kind of special sense of needing to help with fair employment practice.
ED: I see. So this was the begin--
AH: That was the beginning.
ED: This was the seed really, the seed group.
AH: That's right, yes. And furthermore, at that time the consciousness of the segregation and discrimination in the Armed Forces, and what was also significant, the president had established a commission, a wartime commission.
ED: Temporary.
AH: Temporary wartime commission on fair employment. And that had
bee ome as a result of Mr. Randolph's pressure. He had announced that we were marching on Washington. He was the first to use that in that dramatic fashion. And had called a tremendous mass meeting at Madison Square Garden to implement our interests, because Franklin Delano Roosevelt had not been very much interested. He's done the wartime commission and he almost figured that was enough, you see.
ED: Establishment of the temporary commission was what...
AH: He had not established it. But we had been demanding it. And
because he had not established it, Mr. Randolph began this talk of a march on Washington.
ED: Right. Well, I was going to say establishment of it was the way that the march was called off. Was that not true?
AH: That was what called it off. And this TYIadison Square Garden meeting was to let Mr. Roosevelt know that we had some support. Madison Square was jammed that night as.. .
ED: And in reaction to that, Roosevelt made this temporary commission:
AH: Well, in reaction to that, and in reaction, and Eleanor Roosevelt and Fiorello LaGuardia got together on this.
ED: Were they at Madison Square too?
AH: Mrs. Roosevelt was not, I think. And I'm not sure that LaGuardia
was. You see, this was a question mark. The same old business that it may be violent, and what is this all about, and why are these people behaving this way, the same old questions they asked in the﻿Page 94
sixties were being asked then. And when Mr. Randolph had told--and Walter White was in the picture at the time--and the President had asked Walter White what he thought about the involvement of so many-people, "Did he believe that they could bring a hundred thousand people down there?" And Randolph said, "Oh, yes." And Walter White said yes. And so then came the mass meeting to give the demonstration to the fact that he could. And that's how the temporary commission was born. Now Mr. Randolph's next effort is to make the temporary commission permanent. And I was the executive of the effort to do that, with the financial support of private services and all of that. And then...
ED: So you were a paid staff of one, were you not?
AH: I was at that time paid staff of one; I found out immediately that I would need an assistant executive and a legislative representative, somebody who could really pound the halls of Congress on both sides of the aisles and talk about the bill, which had just been written and presented. I got an assistant, a young white woman, Sidney Wilkinson Bercovici. She later married Bercovici. She was Sidney Wilkinson then--an active young businesswoman, referred to me by Allan Knight Chalmers. And she came and was so outgoing and thoughtful and sensitive, it was just a pleasure to deal with her, and I selected her as my assistant at once. And also it was good to have Chalmer's backing, because he was helping to raise funds for the whole thing too. And then Morris sent Ida Fox to serve as a possible legislative representative. She didn't know much about it but she was ready to work hard at it. And I think she's one of the people--she was Jewish--she was one person who' really spent every minute of time she could find on the legislative process, and on understanding what was going on on both sides of the aisles. And she helped train our staff too. Later we had another young Jewish woman, Beatrice Schalet, recommended by Ida, who came on. And one did the House and the other the Senate. So that we could keep up with the day-by-day actions of both floors.
ED: The unsung heroes and heroines that people need to know about.
AH: That's right. And then later the large part of the fundraising responsibility was on my shoulders, in terms of local community. And later we developed regional representatives of our office, built on the federal government's idea of regions. So that you had someone responsible for a group of states, and could call series of conferences on various problems which we faced in fair employment practices legislation and in money. Also the local groups could approach their local electorate, their congressmen, their senators. One time we had a senator in Indiana whom we were "working," as we said, and we had his wife, his minister, and his cook--his cook happened to be Negro--and we had all of them at work in their individual ways. We built varieties of networks in this fashion. So our staff became--before our terms, before we ended our work--something like nine people working all over the country. In the meantime, whenever there was a regional or a major meeting of any kind, I was the speaker. So I was being executive secretary at one moment and presenting the program around the country at the next. That gave me my first national experience, and I was honestly grateful that I knew from Brooklyn, Harlem, the city of New York,﻿Page 95
into the region New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and then into the nation. Because the kinds of information and experience you get feeds into everything, and so that was a great help.
ED: Did you really cover the country, were you all the way to the West?
AH: Oh yes !
ED: Did you have regional work there too?
AH: We went to try to see many of the journalists whom we could not reach easily, in sections of the United Nations in '45.
ED: In San Francisco.
AH: In San Francisco. But we did the whole coast that trip. In fact one of the women I met out there on that trip--what's my Oregon woman's name, Ruth Haefner, H-A-E-F-N-E-R, a Norwegian woman, graduate of the University of Iowa, a real dedicated--so dedicated that when her church didn't do right she resigned. That kind of person. She supported fair employment practices, and got together people for me on that same trip. And then we went from there to--from Oregon, Washington, and Los Angeles--later, after San Francisco. But in San Francisco we had the fortune of meeting so many of the topflight columnists, and to begin to talk with them about fair employment. In the meantime I got a touch of the whole world out of the conference itself, because it was the beginning conference.
ED: Had Merritt come out of the service by now?
AH: Merritt came out of the service in what, darling, '45? In '45.
ED: So that this was just about that time.
AH: That was the point, you see. That's why I was so eager to do it. In fact I know he came out in '45 because I spent his last bonus check on the fair employment practice system...[laughter]
ED: In Washington--he was with the Recorder of Deeds in Washington, you said, for two years. So he was in Washington and you were in Washington.
AH: Yes, yes. I was in Washington first, and I'd visit him in camp; and he'd come to Washington to visit me, the weekends. That was another reason I was glad to go. I figured that since I had to be in Washington it was closer to Greensboro, North Carolina, than this.
ED: So when he came out, he could live in Washington and be working.
AH: So when he came out he was fortunate in securing... Marshall Shepard, of Philadelphia, that very outstanding minister and political leader, also was the recorder of deeds. He asked Merritt to come and work with him. So that both of us were there. And this was fortunate because we lost the battle for fair employment practices at that time. We lost it for a variety of reasons. There were men across this country, and they weren't all Negroes, who were﻿Page 96
very upset by the amount of power we were building. And we didn't realize that fully. And so we did not receive as much financial support as the war broke out. Therefore we really had to close our portion of the struggle. But we had made it a national issue. I never shall forget the difficulty we had cracking the New York Times. None of the big papers were reporting us, and we were doing spectacular things.
ED: And they were upset about your increasing power.
AH: That's right. Not the Times, but...
ED: No, I mean the people who were upset.
AH: Some of the men. I didn't know it then at all because I had not
really faced the straight-out woman problem, as clearly, then. But it was clear later. We were not getting the amount of money we needed, there was this conflict and concern. In fact it was during that time, just toward the end of that, that Walter White offered me the Washington legislative position.
ED: With the NAACP.
AH: With NAACP, the one that Clarence Mitchell had. And I turned it
■down because I considered it an anti-Randolph competition problem, because some of the agencies were jealous of Randolph's ability to sense where things were, and to always move in on the economic end of things. So I just simply turned that down. So that year I took off, Merritt insisted that I was so tired, that I rest. We were very legislatively wise because we couldn't get the bill out of committee. They assign 'em to committees, and they're supposed to bring 'em to the Congress for vote.
ED: And it didn't get to the floor.
AH: No. And Mrs. Roosevelt held a meeting for us at the White House,
and I think she hoped she could get him to step in and say hello and maybe make a commitment, but she didn't get him. " We had a very important and distinguished group there. But he didn't even come out to say hello. Meantime he died...
ED: That's right, April, '45.
AH: That's right, he died in April, and Harry S. Truman became
president. Harry Truman I had known in the Senate when he was fighting the war program, the defense spending and all of the meaning of it. Not well, but enough to know what he stood for. And the first thing he did was to indicate his effort to carry out the program which he presumed Roosevelt had started. And we were the beneficiaries. He sent for me, sent me to talk with his Secretary of Labor, [Lewis B.] Schwellenbach, and made him our official liaison for the White House.
ED: AH:
Another positive on Harry Truman.
Oh, he was tremendous. So that was a great help. He asked the Rules Committee to release the bill for passage in the American way.﻿Page 97
Well, they didn't do it. And we did get to the floor once, mostly because a senator had to go to the bathroom, a senator who was in the opposition. We did get that one time. But we didn't have real debate and consideration. William L. Dawson...
ED: Of Chicago.
AH: ... was a tremendous support.
ED: Black congressman from Chicago.
AH: African American congressman now.
ED: All right, my dear.
AH: But anyway, William L. Dawson, probably the greatest political
leader of this century, he went about naming mayors and doing all sorts of things. He was very much in our corner. And Charles LaFollette, Republican from Indiana; see Dawson was Democratic; Charles LaFollette, a Republican from Indiana. Once we had a date in the South, and because of a tie-up it was hard to get there. We had to hire a plane, and LaFollette paid for the plane. I never forgot it. And there were others. Wayne Morse was a very staunch supporter, conservative in the beginning, Republican in the beginning, but a lawyer, tremendous mind, and a great concern—He was out of the United Church too, by the way, and you see the United Church had more real background among Negroes than any other church, from the very beginning--except of course the Negro churches per se--but this is a white denomination, the Congregationalists led. They're the ones that set up the elementary and high school systems in the South, and many of the colleges.
ED: Was it? I thought it was Methodist.
AH: Congregational. Methodists had some schools too, and so did other denominations. But it was the Congregationalists who took on the fight for equality, not just a bit of opportunity here and there, but for equality of opportunity. Wayne Morse was part of that tradition, and he himself was broadly concerned with the total of life, and happened to be a constitutional lawyer, so he was very good at advising us. Someday I want to write that story and include all of the senators and congressmen who were so helpful.
ED: Yes. Well, where are we now in time, we're in the year '45, aren't we?
AH: The year '45.
ED: And Truman has become president, he's thrown his weight behind you.
AH: And by the way, he threw his weight behind us and, at the time he ran for his own presidency, I.was asked by Dawson to head that campaign.
ED: In?﻿Page 98
AH: In the country. You see I had just been all over the country; he
knew this. I'd been working with the Congress, he knew that. I had known New York City where many of the things were held, so that I was a natural. And the men were in the Army and were still not out of the Army, so I think that gave me the extra break too. But anyway, I was...
ED: Was this to head the campaign in the country generally or among Afro-Americans?
AH: Any place. Both. Any place. To be first, first, of course, for the Negro, as a part of the Democratic National Committee. But because it was part of the Democratic National Committee, you also met the local Democrats and you needed to do that.
ED: Did you take it?
AH: I'll tell you a little later. This is still '45. We'd done the
West Coast, we were finished, and even in spite of Truman's help, we were not able to pass the bill. And our funds were running out, and so we retired from the field. But the old committee on leadership in Washington was the result of our organization.
ED: Yes, what was the name of that...
AH: Leadership Conference. The Leadership Conference was a direct
result of our activity because we had set up in Washington, a local group composed of the representatives of national organizations: white, black, green, and brown, Mexican, Indian and the whole thing.
ED: And that became the Leadership Conference.
AH: Well, not precisely, they were too smart for that. But again they were afraid of the polar idea, and a group of them took over the Leadership Conference. The NAACP was very active, and a good many of the Jewish agencies and the other religious agencies, all developed the Leadership Council. It was actually out of our brainchild that it happened. We closed out our immediate task in a very spectacular fashion. We ran a dinner at the Mayflower Hotel, "than which there was no whicher," as the kids say, with representatives of all the national organizations there.
ED:	Now, was the Mayflower Hotel having dinners in which...
AH:	We were the first to run a big dinner there.
ED:	An interracial dinner.
AH:	Completely interracial, we had everybody out.
ED:	But this was the first time that they had served Afro-Americans.
AH: Yes, in that fashion. Now individuals again, you know, you never know, may have been in and out, but the hotel was not generally open.
ED: Why'd you choose the Mayflower?﻿Page 99
AH: Mayflower. Because it was Mayflower. Because of the word itself. We thought we'd make it as hard as we could for anybody to turn down. Everybody came. Life magazine sent a photographer, and I hope someday to have enough money to go to Life and see if I can get a copy of that picture because it was remarkable. And that night, the next night, the filibuster began in the United States Senate, and we did lose. And then later we were liquidated, more or less, because we had run out of funds. At that point, Merritt decided--that's my husband--that I was going to rest a year.
ED: Probably a wise decision.
AH: Well, I had to. I was just tired to the bone. In fact there's some pictures taken in that period I'd love to get my hands on to destroy them. So I, in that same year, however--Susie Elliott, who was dean of women at Howard University, asked me to work as an assistant dean on the campus at Howard while she was on sabbatical.
ED: You couldn't take it.
AH: I did.
ED: This was to be your year of rest.
AH: I did take it, and I had the most thrilling time, because the young people were not being given as much of the whole political scene as they wanted, and of course they were excited about my work on the Hill, so with all of it I had...
ED: Did you have any period of rest between the two?
AH: Yes, I did. Not enough, but some. I worked with the students,
organizing them to think about significant issues. And we planned a big women's day. And when I talked with the students, they said, "Oh, it's not our day, it belongs to the dean." So I knew what that meant. Same old thing again, you know, so I got them together. And I named a representative for each floor. They had freshmen on one floor, sophomores, and juniors and seniors, each floor in the dormitories. A freshman from each, I mean a student from each of the classes made a little council out of it to advise me on what they wanted on the program. They didn't really know clearly what they wanted, but they were glad to talk about it. So when I got some ideas together, I checked with them, and they were very excited about it. There were two people I decided I wanted on; one was Judge then, Justine Wise Polier, from New York, to give it a larger flavor than it had.
ED:	Children's Court, right.
AH:	Well, I'm not sure which court—family, I think,
ED:	Children's Court, with Hubert T. Delany...Justine Wise.
AH:	Yes, Justine Wise.
ED:	Yes, they were the Children's Court judges.﻿Page 100
AH: It was one of the courts in New York, and I wanted that kind of broad exposure. And the other one was a name you may not know, Ellen, Venice Spraggs, S-P-R-A-G-G-S. She was the Chicago Defender's top reporter in Washington, and a very dynamic and live gal. So I put the two of them together and talked to the group about it, told them who they were and all. When I found they didn't have any suggestion—and on the Thursday night before the final meeting we were to have, I got a hurry crisis call from Birmingham, Alabama, to speak for the meeting there that they were having--I've forgotten what the subject was, but it was something vital enough to make me—no, that's not what happened. I had accepted that engagement before I went to Howard, and felt I had to meet it. I called the students together and explained to them what had happened and said, "Will you be sure that the hall is packed while I'm gone, I won't be here to talk with the different groups. And since you are the leaders of your floors, would you do what you can?" And I got back into Washington from Birmingham, Alabama, on Saturday morning, and the meeting was due at eleven. And I went over there with my heart in my mouth. They poured in.
ED: The students had done their job.
AH: The first time in years that they had had a jammed auditorium, it was chapel, for Women's Day. They had it for other things. President Mordecai Wyatt Johnson was there, and when he was going to appear, that chapel was jammed all the way across the mall. But this was Women's Day, and they had not had many people. And the reason I'd been able to challenge them was, I had spoken for them when I was with FEPC, and they didn't have many people out. So I told them how embarrassed I had been; they really jammed that hall. One young woman came in and walked up to me, and she was dressed very carelessly, I think she. had on dungarees in a day when we just didn't wear them, she didn't look like chapel. So she said to me, "Do I look alright to come in?" I said, "It has to be your decision. You represent Howard University this morning, and you represent women this morning. And if you believe that you're doing it effectively, come right on in." She glared at me, turned around and went home and came back dressed to the teeth!
ED: What a wonderful way to put it. Put the decision right where it belongs.
AH: Right where it belonged; it was hers, not mine. Well, we had a glorious meeting. Justine was tremendous, and so was Venice Spraggs. They saw two people of accomplishment, white and Negro, in the same setting, both of them giving their special talents to their day.
ED: Do you have a copy of the program from that meeting among your...
AH: If I have, it's in storage.
ED: It's a memorable occasion.
AH: And on top of that, they had developed their own music for it, you see. Not only their music, but they had developed a service of﻿Page 101
worship themselves so that they were in that program, you see, the old participation thing, which the dear old YWCA had taught me. They did so many bad things to me I always have to stop and remember all the excellent things. They knew program, they knew how to develop program...
ED: And they knew training.
AH: And they knew how to get you to participate within it. All of it
came back, and they had a glorious time. And the same thing applied all the way through. They were sure, the dean was sure--the acting dean was sure I couldn't do it again. So she put me in charge of what she called "promotion" for the next one. So I said, "Well, if I have the privilege of calling the girls together, I'd be glad, and may I do that?" Oh, you had to watch protocol very carefully. I called and met with each floor, and got each building to plan their song for the next meeting, the next big assembly they were to have, plan their song for it. So each of the classes had a song to present, and a little speech presentation to make. I didn't worry about program. I didn't even go get a speaker. There they were, it was really enough to carry...
ED: It was enough to carry itself.
AH: Enough to carry it beautifully.
ED: Now I have here in my notes that we want to deal with S.S.A?
AH: No, you don't yet. Oh wait a minute. Right after the Howard thing came the Truman campaign. And that was just a tremendous experience. Congressman Dawson was then on the Democratic National Committee, a good many people didn't realize that. He was the vice-chairman. And a very effective one because he knew his politics.
ED: Is Mr. Dawson still living?
AH: No. He died several years ago. Congressman Dawson was one of the few people in official Washington who believed that Truman could win--remember he was now running on his own--and decided to really organize a campaign among Negroes because he was the first president of the United States to ask a committee to release a fair employment practices bill, a bill primarily concerning Negroes, for discussion and vote.
ED: And hadn't he desegregated the army by this time? Or was that in his. . .
AH: No. It was in the works and he was working on it and very much interested in it. But this was his direct act in terms of us.
ED: A Southern president, at that.
AH: Born out of the Confederacy backround. His mother was a member of the DAR. But, in the, well, I'll do that later... Congressman Dawson knew that people across the country had been living with FEPC and the meaning of fair employment practices, and were being confronted in th.6i.ir communities by soldiers ^returning- home who﻿Page 102
needed jobs, and members of the other Armed Forces and therefore, would be receptive of Truman as one of the staunch supporters. Sidney Wilkinson, whom I mentioned as an assistant to me, during the whole FEPC battle, suggested that we call the campaign "Truman Fights for Human Rights," and that's what we called it. We had— Congressman Dawson established our headquarters, his and mine, and of course the rest of the representatives from the Democratic National Committee were there as — established the Biltmore Hotel, here in New York, as headquarters.
When I got to New York my friends were very, very sad for me. They asked me why I didn't for once get on a winning team, that always I had been for principles, which meant that I lost. With that challenge ringing in my ears... And they said almost the same thing of Congressman Dawson, why would he stake his political reputation on this struggle. But of course I was of lesser importance nationally, as far as they were concerned, but more important locally, so it was a real nice bit of conflict at the time.
With that challenge I went to work, and we worked this country. Your father would have been interested in the time I spent in St. Louis, for instance, where the political leaders — one of them was a man by the name of Jordan, whom I've never forgotten. The political leaders in St. Louis were very helpful; we held meetings there. Some of them were—most of them were integrated in the political scene, you see, around the country, because they were in the habit of working with each other to get out the vote. And when men are concerned with getting out the vote they can even forget about color for a few minutes. So many of them had worked together, and I made speeches and raised money. This happened in town after town across the country.
ED: This must have been a fantastic experience.
AH: One night we were in, oh, what's the other big city in Missouri?
Kansas City! And the Truman train came in and we went aboard the train. Truman was on and Charlie Ross—who was his public relations advisor right out of the White House, and I had known his sister-Charles Ross was on, and the local politicians of Kansas City, Negro and white. And we had a great time with Truman. He was glad to see us, and we were glad to see him. But the thing that impressed me most was that everyone said that Truman, as a judge in Jackson County of Kansas City, had always been a just and thoughtful judge. And this applied to race as well as to everything else. So that he had his own heritage which he brought.
ED: Which area was the hardest to convince? I imagine the Northeast. Wouldn't, wasn't that?...
AH: No.
ED: Where did you have your most trouble?
AH: In a political campaign you don't even worry about that. You tell
your story as dramatically as you can to whomever you reach and hope that it carries through. And you watch again, just as I had done in the fair employment practices scrap. You look for people who have﻿Page 103
relationships to many other people. So that if individuals accept your report, they then are in a position to carry it on. And then they have all their local reasons for being involved. Time went on and I...
ED: Must have been exciting.
AH: I knew whether if the polls were voting in one section, what one could expect. If the Jews were active in another what could be expected. If Negroes were anyplace, we could figure out from which ones were active, whether we were getting to the larger vote, all these kinds of things. I'll never forget that the night before election I sat up counting all night.
ED: Pardon me, who was his opponent? This wasn't Dewey.
AH: Yes it was.
ED: Was this the night that Dewey went to bed thinking he'd been elected?
AH: Yes, yes.
ED: So he was running against Thomas E. Dewey.
AH: And everybody said that Dewey was going to win. He had a good
reputation generally, and he'd been pretty decent about race too; he'd had his own little committee working on racial matters. Everyone said that Dewey was going to win. We sat up that night and counted. At that time I was staying with Mrs. Helen Curtis. Did you ever know Mrs. Curtis?
ED: In a.;.
AH: Mrs. James Curtis.
ED: In...
AH: Brooklyn.
ED: No. I don't think so.
AH: I was staying with her periodically, living sometimes at the
Biltmore, you know, living around but really pretty much staying with Mrs. Curtis. Mrs. Curtis, incidentally, ought to have her story done. She was the widow of James L. Curtis, who was one of the first ministers to Liberia. And she, in her own right, had been what they called in those days a "modiste" and had had much of her training in Paris.
ED: Is she living now?
AH: No. She was a very beautiful woman. Very aggressive and during the war had run a hostess house in Brooklyn. And was the first Negro woman overseas in World War I. Just a tremendous person.
ED: Somebody should get that down, yes.﻿Page 104
AH: Well the two of us sat up all night counting the votes. You see, we didn't have the kind of recording with electronic machines and all of that. We'd count: "Add this many to that number."
ED: This was at the Biltmore.
AH: Yes--no, this was in Mrs. Curtis's home. All of a sudden it dawned on us that the move was in, that the sweep was in, that Truman was really winning. We got our clothes on and rushed madly to the Biltmore. Reached there at precisely 11:14 when Truman's win was announced.
And that place went up in smoke. Delegates, people there who had not supported him really, you know, and had behaved tongue-in-cheek and had given a little money to Dewey, because even if you're a Democrat you help a Republican if you think he's going to win, you may need him later, all of that. These people were coming in like mad, and cheering, and so thrilled because, after all, they could still offer a little money and kind of be in, if you know what I mean.
ED: And all of this was being reported to us over radio, wasn't it?
AH: Oh, yes. And so this was just one of those thrilling political moments, and Truman was in. Then, following that, Congressman Dawson asked me if I was interested in federal employment. And of course I said yes.
ED: Where were you living now?
AH: We were actually living in Washington.
ED: Still living in Washington.
AH: Yes, but I had the room here when I wanted to use it. And had lived with Mrs. Curtis during the time when Merritt first went to the Army. So we were old friends. In fact she had been largely responsible for my going to Brooklyn. She said, "Those old ladies," she was old herself, you know, it was the cutest thing, "those old ladies over there need help, and I want you to come." And she went back and maneuvered their invitation to me. She didn't put that in, and should have.
Well, anyway. I was very much interested and said so. And I was called for interview at HEW. Oscar R. Ewing was the administrator of what they called then the Federal Security Agency.
ED: FSA.
AH: Which is now, the FSA, which is now HEW: Health, Education, and
Welfare. The same agency, only the Republicans wouldn't vote to let us call it that. They waited till they were in power. But Mr. Ewing would correspond now to what--to [Joseph A.] Califano, in that responsibility. And I was named one of his assistants. Not on race, but a general administrative assistant, a member of what would﻿Page 105
have been his cabinet. The first Negro woman at that top administrative level in the history of the country.
ED: I would imagine that's true.
AH: And of course...
ED: And what was your specific assignment? Your area.
AH: My specific assignment was HEW: know all I could know about health, education, and welfare.
ED: Health, education and welfare.
AH: Now fortunately I had always had to work in education. I had worked with it in grade schools and high schools and colleges in this town, and across the country as I talked about fair employment practices, and had real acquaintance with the academic world.
ED: Yes. And certainly with the welfare world, with your position.
AH: And then I had the welfare.
ED: So health was thrown in.
AH: Health was—no, health was the one that I had to do some work on.
The Hill-Burton Act was then very prominent and I studied the Hill-Burton Act.
ED: Which was specifically to...?
AH: It had to do with hospitals, primarily, contributions to hospitals, a picture of the general health field as well. It was very important legislation. And Dr. Leonard Scheele, who was the surgeon general, was a very charming and thoughtful man, and I asked him to see that I had all the literature that I ought to have under my belt if I was going to adequately represent the agency. And he gave it to me. And then I would go to sessions that they had.
We traveled all over the country, all of the different districts, talking with the local people and learning about things that are going on. In fact it was such an exciting job in terms of learning about things, that I always regretted hearing anybody call federal government just a bureaucracy. These were exciting, committed people.
The racial situation was very complicated. In fact, I've always been hurt by the elevator operators in the administration building at Fourth--what is it, Fourth Street, Fourth and Independence (thanks, Merritt!)-- Fourth and Independence, Southwest, which was where the building was located, a big building.
When I came on that day, the elevator operators were so thrilled that somebody was on the fifth floor; that was the top administrative floor. And about the third day one of them said to me, "Mrs. Hedgeman, you don't have to ride up on this car with these﻿Page 106
white folks if you don't want to. We can take you up there express if you just say it."
ED: And you had said you always felt...
AH: I felt heartbroken by their necessity to think that way. And I
said, "No, I won't let you do that because an elevator must always be open to all people."
ED: Yes. The negative negativeness.
AH: "And they must be equally welcome. And our job's to see to it that some more of us"--and they knew exactly, when I said vof us'--"that more of us get on this floor. And I'm going to work on that, with your help."
ED: And it was of course the right answer. Did you have an opportunity to hire any additional staff?
AH: That brings me to my favorite story. I was given the privilege of choosing a secretary. Now here I am at the administrative level, being used for the first time at that level as a woman, and as a Negro. Now, there were other women, but as a Negro woman, I should say. And, aware of the fact that I was the only one of us on that floor. There were no secretaries on the floor. There were secretaries in other parts of the building. But I knew instantly that we didn't have our full opportunity. Now, when the personnel director called me, she said, "Um, do you want, um, a Negro secretary?" And there it was. What should I answer? So I thought fast, and 1 said to her, "No, I want one of the best secretaries you have in this building. I'll need it, because the load here is going to be extraordinarily heavy. I want her to be qualified in every way, because the task is difficult." "Well you don't care then." I said, "No. I've been working with Fair Employment Practices. And our creed there was that opportunity ought to be available to everyone without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin. An opportunity is here, so send me your best."
Well I know she was puzzled, and I was worried because I really didn't know quite how it was going to work out. So I asked... Oh, they sent me five folders, personnel folders, for five people, and I went through them with a fine-toothed comb. And discovered that the two best in the five were Negroes. And I knew why. They had not had their adequate opportunity. So I selected two for a choice, and both were Negroes. And looking her dead in the eye, the personnel director when she came to pick them up, I said just that. "The two best in these files happen to be Negroes." And I went over them with her, showing her their variety of experience. And I said, "I realized two things: that these girls had not had their adequate opportunity, for they should not be at the level they are now. But I also know that you haven't sent me your best whites. So, these are the kinds of things that you as personnel person must work for."
Now, I'm out of that, but the one I chose first was brown, a lovely looking girl--I've never--I can see her sitting at my desk now. And so I decided that because she was brown and the two girls--the other girl was light, but their abilities were comparable, I'd take the﻿Page 107
brown one. When the brown one went down to her office and reported that I was ask...--considering her, and I told her, they promoted her. So I'm left with my fair one.
ED: Isn't that the way they do things.
AH: It just shows you how you cannot win. Now you had the problem of
the other girls in the building who would say that I had selected a light person because I am not good brown. What do you do?
Well we always have allies if we but know it, and there was a man on the floor who was a kind of general factotum, he had a desk in the end of the front of the lobby of that floor, and was a sort of person who did errands, almost anything. And he was dressed in good looking street clothes, but he was really a kind of porter for the floor, and particularly for the administrator. He drove a car sometimes. So I called him now, said, "Mr. Fletcher, I've got a problem." He was Negro. I told him the whole story. And I said, "You know what these people are going to say." He said, "I certainly do. But I'm glad you told me because I'll take care of it."
ED: The network was working again, wasn't it.
AH: I don't know what his network--I don't know what he, his particular network was, but I never heard a complaint. Now it happened that the girl herself, too, was well liked, and had never in any way been anything but a real person, unconcerned with race, creed, color, national origin or anything else.
ED: Just a good secretary.
AH: Just a good, solid secretary. There were other problems of course because they had not had anyone at the administrative level in the whole agency. In the Office of Education we had had outstanding Negroes, one or two. Their functioning had not always been easy because of color, again. And one of the very prominent members of the Office of Education, believe it or not, could hardly speak to me, because I, by being with the Administrator, was a cut above his stature as a member of the staff of the Office of Education. We had other problems, of course, the White House Conference on Children and Youth, I was liaison for that, and a great many organizations were not accustomed to this, because many of them didn't yet have Negro staff members, you know, people forget that. And if they did, they would not have their staff member necessarily at the national level at that moment, even for conferences. The executive would come, and she would be white.
ED:	There was no other Negro at this federal level, was there?
AH:	At this federal level, right.
ED:	In any of the other divisions of the government.
AH:	No place else that I know about.
ED:	That's very significant.﻿Page 108
AH: Now again, it's often possible that there was someone, somewhere,
that you never hear of, as we were talking earlier. But I am fairly sure that you would find that accurate.
ED: 'Cause we certainly now see...
AH: But we had people in departments.
ED: And Roosevelt had Mrs. Bethune as a member, not of his cabinet, as an advisor.
AH:	She was called advisor.
ED:	He did not have a Negro cabinet member, did he?
AH:	Let's see, when did...
ED:	And Truman did not either.
AH:	When did, when did Weaver come in?
ED:	Bob Weaver was the first. He was with President Johnson, was he not? Wasn't he with Johnson, or Kennedy? Kennedy!
AH: Oh, not Kennedy, no, that was too late for that. I'm not sure of
where he came in. I believe it was Roosevelt, because that was the era of the Black Cabinet, you see. He may not have gotten promotion then, but he was an active part of the housing program at first and then later of other programs. He probably has the most distinguished record in government.
ED: Yes, O.K. Another point--
AH: I can't give you exact precise years on it.
ED: Right. We can, of course, hope that those who are using this tape for study purposes, the students, will at this point go and look that up.
AH: Well somebody needs to do the story of what was called eventually the Black Cabinet.
ED: Right. Absolutely.
AH: Because that's where Mrs. Bethune had a great deal of power.
ED: Under Roosevelt.
AH: You see, actually Mrs. Roosevelt was the political leader of that era, and nobody has yet written that up properly. And I suspect that she knew more individual Negroes than almost anybody in the country, as a white woman.
ED:
I'm sure it's true, yes.﻿Page 109
AH: And she had to have--she wanted to help her husband. And she used two people in that vote period: Helen Gahagan Douglas, the West Coast; and Mary Bethune, the Negro vote. And this was very excellent politics, because Mary was moving around the country talking with everyone, and people had big excitement about her because she was dramatic, and no idea was too big for her, and they enjoyed that. She never knew herself what was coming next. We'd
pay her way ■_ to the YWCA there when young people were
very confused about color, and Philadelphia had had this long white complex because more light people got jobs in those days. So we got Mrs. Bethune to talk with them, and she had a way of sort of rearing back on her heels--you know, she was heavy-set, and what people in this country, white or black, are likely to describe as ugly; she had a strong, rugged kind of face--and she'd rear back and say, "The ground on which I stand is holy ground. With God's help I make it so." And young people would just be so excited and thrilled, you know. Well she had all of this, and this is great political capital, in fact she should have been in theatre. She and Adam Powell. Both had that flair for an audience and knew what to do with it. And Mary Bethune--and Helen Gahagan Douglas had drawn the same kind of power on the West coast. Not in the same way, but she was positive about.issues, and attractive, and she'd been in the theatre and music. And she had that extra thing that Roosevelt needed, and Mary Bethune got it for her, and in turn Mary Bethune was able to reach the White House when people needed her. All this made a good story. Much to the disappointment of the old dying Washingtonians who were so accustomed to being thought of as very special and unusual, and here was Mary Bethune.
ED: Could we at this point also ask you to share with us the fact that, in contrast to what you were describing earlier as the lack of civil service jobs in New York City, that as far as the federal government was concerned the number of federal jobs, for instance this pool of secretaries they were able to pull to... In other words, Black, Negroes in Washing--
AH: In that period it was Negroes, right.
ED: I was saying it too--in Washington were beginning to swell the ranks of employment.
AH: Beginning. You see we had the op--
ED: Yes. I mean the picture was so different from New York, I was going to ask you--
AH: No, it wasn't all that different.
ED: Well...
AH: The concentration, see, what had happened initially was that the Recorder of Deeds Office belonged to Negroes...
ED: Right. Did I tell you that my grandfather Trotter, my mother's father, was appointed to the Recorder of Deeds?
AH: No. That's interesting. Then you know what I'm talking- about.﻿Page 110
ED: Was recorder in 1800.
AH: The Recorder of Deeds Office was supposed to belong to Negroes. And that followed continually. They had let a good many into the print, what was it, the printing...
ED: The--what did they call--the Mint--no, the Printing Office!
AH: The Government Printing Office had employed a good many. The Post Office had traditionally employed a good many.
ED: Railway.
AH: The railway clerk thing was always terrible, it was something that we had to fight all the time. They had--but, well take the Federal Security Agency when I went there. In the Children's Bureau we had a couple of Negroes. The Children's Bureau, now dealing with the children of the nation.
ED: Right, but remember back in the time of Wilson, when there was so much upset...
AH: That had to do with these printing people and...
ED: Yes, and, they had been eating together, and he came along and made the separation.
AH: Well, there was objection to their eating together. His wife, people think, and I cannot verify this, was a Southerner.
ED: The second wife, Edith Gait.
AH: Edith Gait. And it seems that Edith Gait had seen some people
eating in the same cafeteria, and had resented it, and started a program against it. Now that's part of the story. For it was always incompatible with Wilson's international stand, except that one has to remember that he too came out of the South. Davidson was his college. And I had the experience of being on the Davidson campus to talk to students and having them point out to me where he had lived and all of that, and have to say to them, "I'm glad to have you tell me that he did have some very outstanding relationships here," and give them a little bit of history of our experience with him.
But again, that was not at the level we're now talking about.
ED: No, I'm not speaking on the levels, I'm speaking of the fact that...
AH: There's another department there...
ED: ...Negroes had jobs. Treasury.
AH: Treasury had a few.﻿Page 111
ED: But I mean not many, and not significant, but the fact that Negroes in Washington had federal jobs, unlike what was happening in many of the cities. Is that not true? In contrast...
AH: I think a few more, because you see this was the first freedmen area, freed of slaves as far back as Lincoln. So that there had always been some civil service employees. Furthermore, Washington is a government town so that they almost had to take in numbers of Negroes, but they were in minor roles...
ED: Minor roles and minor numbers.
AH: ...And not tied to, with the exception of Howard University, which was a freedmen's spot--if you remember your university history--and the Recorder of Deeds. But--and then we had a senator or two, and a representative or two in that early, beginning Reconstruction era. So that there has been some tradition there, which again ought to be reviewed. There are probably people who know it, but I don't know it intimately..
ED: One time, someone who was describing for me the history of Negroes in Washington said, "You know, you must remember that there's this small cadre of people who were early affiliated with the federal government, and it is out of that group that there grew that belief that they were special, and that they were above other people in the country." You know, they were talking at that time about the snobbishness of the Washington persons, and that it grew out of the fact that, well, around the country these kinds of jobs weren't held. They were beginning to be held in Washington even though in small numbers.
AH: » Well, it was in the post-Reconstruction era. Somebody ought to do the real story of the Negroes who came into that, District of Columbia, where freedom was declared, you see, before the Emancipation time. So I don't know that whole period.
ED: But it would be interesting to have it researched, wouldn't it?
AH: Yes. Now as you go back now, I mean as you go back to the time I was there, each department you'd find one or two people. For instance we had a Minorities Division in the Department of Welfare. Thomasina Johnson Norford was an executive in that division. We had a woman in education who did international education as well, and some of the early work of developing language translations. Wilkinson, a Miss Wilkinson.
ED: From South Carolina?
AH: I think not, I think she was New England, as I remember. But
anyway, she was especially interested in language, and then we had another assistant in there and the educator.
ED: Man or woman?
AH: Man.
MH: He died.﻿Page 112
AH: He died, yes.
ED: Mont? No?
AH: No. He was in the Office of Education for years, but the one person until he was able to get a couple of other people in. It was this sort of thing. It was not...
ED: Singular in many instances.
AH: In many instances singular, or, at most, two in many instances. And in many, none.
ED: Were there many secretaries scattered throughout the federal government?
AH: Scattered through, there were a good many, in our terms again, in
New York terms, but not as many as you would think. And there again it tended to rest on some connection you had with a senator or a representative somewhere. You see, Washington had no vote, and therefore had no political clout, but it did have the clout of the old-time resident in spots. And they had a judge, Judge [Robert] Terrell, Mary Church Terrell's husband, was a judge. And he was--from what I knew of her, and what she had said of him--he was the kind of person who would push for Negroes wherever it was possible. Just as she opened up the university field when the Association of University Women wouldn't take Negro women; she was battling for it. So there were people like that. And the men who used to be at Tuskegee years ago were there. There's a fascinating story of where people were in Washington, under what circumstances; that somebody ought to do, and may have done. Because one of the things you discover is that there's endless literature on the Negro that's never been synthesized and so we don't have it at our fingertips. And now what I'm giving you is from memory.
ED: Yes, yes. O.K. Do you think at this point you want to tell us how long you stayed with FSA and when you left?
AH: I was there four years.
ED: Oh! Well then there're probably more stories in terms of...
AH: Oh, there're endless ones. What I was trying to do was to pick the personnel thing that I dealt with directly. I ought to do a bit on the White House Conference on Children and Youth, because I was Mr. Ewing's liaison officer for that, and it was an international conference in terms of attendance and program development.
ED: Right. What year was that?
AH: 1950. That was the first one. I was in two. And as liaison person to that, I dealt with--from my relationship to the cabinet level, which is what Mr. Ewing should have been--I was his liaison with Katharine Lenroot, who was the director of the Children's Bureau, and who was a very thoughtful, hardworking woman of great concern﻿Page 113
for children. Problems there were piled up. Do you know Dr. Mays, Benjamin Mays of Atlanta University?
ED: Yes.
AH: Well, Dr. Mays--we had tried to set up committees across the country from the various states to pull together state plans, state ideas on the problems of children for this international meeting. We had the problem of [Herman E.] Talmadge in Georgia. They didn't put a Negro on the first committee. And so we had to decide: do you set up a special committee? And how do you integrate it? We had all those problems. And this we had all across the South. And Katharine Lenroot would stand right with you in battling for it. But with a little nervousness, because the natipnal thing must go, and someday somebody must write about the suffering that whites go through as they have to meet change, and change from that which they have been told is the way to go. And they...
ED: And when they take their stand, and when it's better, right...
AH: And how difficult it is for them to take it. And when they don't
take it, and what the pressures are that make them not, because I...
ED: How they judge the issue.
AH: Yes, and that'll help us more in knowing how to, how to get at them! Some learned the hard way and discovered that a woman senator could do more with her than we could. All of this is in the picture as we face the complications. The other thing that I found very exciting was serving on the Civil Service, as a Civil Service Commission representative for Mr. Ewing. And I also worked with, I mentioned the Children's Bureau, Office of Education. Dr. Buell Gallagher came while I was there.
ED: From Talladega?
AH: Talladega. Came to Washington to work on the staff of Earl McGrath, who was then Commissioner of Education, and he was a great help. One of the women there called him a breath of fresh air.
ED: I can imagine so, knowing him.
AH: He arrived in my office door one morning, opened it up and said,
standing right in the door, didn't even wait to come in, "I'm Buell Gallagher." And I laughed and I said, "I've heard that name before." And he was always an ally. We could talk about anything. And his wife was equally interesting.
ED: His papers...
AH: June. [his wife]
ED: June, right, you're right. His papers, you know, his recent death,, they're wondering where his...
AH: Yes I went to the memorial service.﻿Page 114
ED: Where his papers should go. Someone was saying that some of his papers they wanted to get to the Schomburg--want to--you know, at least the discussion was going on.
AH: And I'd like to see some of them go to Talladega.
ED: I'm sure some of them should, yes.
AH: Yes, because he was President there. In fact, much of his administrative experience...
ED: Came from Talladega.
AH: He got right at Talladega.- And that to me is exciting, because I have a theory, you know, that a good many white people never would have been able to get as far as they did if they hadn't had this contact with people who were living minute by minute with education, as they had to do in the South. And with a zest for it that came out of the post Civil War period. Everybody wanted an education.
ED: And to learn in that...
AH: In that setting.
ED: ...kind of a setting was the best kind...
AH: And all of the complications of being in exile in the South, because you were working with a Negro group.
ED: Right. In exile from your own group.
AH: All this, exile in every way. Exile from your own, and have to be tested like mad before you're really accepted in the Negro group. So that they ran that gamut which later they had to meet in federal government. In many ways, as we are a replica of what goes on in the world, in a very fascinating way.
ED: So many themes we could go off on, couldn't we?
AH: On and on... And if we could get some of these--well one of the
reasons I like to drop little bits and pieces is that students, if they read, may pick up an interest which will add, and particularly Negro students. So that if...
ED: That is what the purpose of this taping is, to place these tapes in the libraries for research for students in studying the lives of you women who are notable American women, and in this particular project, American Black Women. As students study these tapes, listen, and read the transcripts they will, as you say, have topics for further research.
AH: I'm hoping too that somehow they'll find a way to pick out academic institutions across the country. See, white people have to have their ignorance corrected. And I say ignorance because it's lack, total lack, and it isn't their fault, I'm not blaming them. They've been indoctrinated with North Europe.﻿Page 115
ED: I like that, the way you're putting it, I noticed that. North Europe, because you're saying that southern Europe has suffered also.
AH: They suffered many problems. Not as many. We have suffered nothing that some group hasn't suffered. The problem is that we had the brunt of one special kind of suffering that none of them had to work with. None of them. The immigrant who came in had problems. I worked with Immigration and International Service in the YW. I met with women from other countries who were struggling with language, who were struggling with jobs, who were struggling with all the problems I was. But they were not rejected on the basis of the color of their eyes, or whether they had straight hair or wavy hair or kinky hair: none of those things mattered. But they did have many of the same struggles, and one of these days I want you to read the thing I'm doing on slave women. You talk about...
ED: Oh, you've started that, you've started it, one of your four books.
And as you've been talking today I've been thinking of a fifth book.
AH: What is that?
ED: Ann Hedgeman, the rebel. Because in each job...
AH: I was not the rebel, you see.
ED: Well, let me put it the way I hear it. In each job you stood for principle and upset the apple cart.
MH: That's right.
ED: You had to, you wrote your ticket of resignation, your letter of resignation because you knew that the members had to have a democratic vote. I mean, you could have put that under the carpet and gone on being the executive there. So I'm calling that rebel, now maybe there's another word for it. But in the jobs that you've had you stood for principle and this caused, in many cases, the necessity for you to have to go elsewhere.
AH: The only thing I want to say at that point is that the word "rebel" has come to mean rejection of whatever. The content is never reviewed, so that rebel, and violence, and vigilante, and terrorists...
ED: You put those together.
AH: I put 'em all together.
ED: Somehow I don't put rebel with those, but maybe that's just my way of looking--rebel I think of as bucking the system when the system was against your principles.
AH: That's what the terrorist is doing, that's what crime in the streets is doing, that's what happened in the White House... You see what I'm getting at...﻿Page 116
ED: What would be the word you would use to describe yourself then, when you had to move on because of principle? Ann, the...
AH: That's a rough one, let me tell you why.
ED: Ann, the questioner, Ann, the issue-raiser...
AH: Well this is the point, you see, the raised issues are not raised by me; that's why the word rebel bothers me. The issues were not raised by me: I met 'em in my search for truth.
ED: Well maybe that should be the title of your book.
AH: But I didn't raise them. You know, I think I'm going to use another one if I ever do mine, and I doubt I will because it'll be all--in all the others.
ED: The search for truth.
AH: Yeah.
ED: That would be a great title.
AH: I think my title would be, if I wrote one, the one I've been using, remember... I doubt I'll get to it because the other four have to be done. New world citizen.
MH:	It isn't rational?
ED:	That's not what?
MH:	It's not rational.
AH:	It is, it isn't known as that, it's in that whole vein.
ED:	Yes, but I think he means that doesn't grab quite in the same way.
AH: I know, I know. Which is part of the problem. One of the--Newman did the book on English, you know, and pointed out how terrible our English is. And one of these days I'm going to send him a note, I know him quite well.
ED: Edwin Newman.
AH: And tell him that now it's time for him to put some content into words. For instance, the word "conservative" is being batted around. It's a perfectly good word. But we've made it stand for nothing. Of course one conserves. It is what one conserves.
ED: Content, I see what you mean. Of course one conserves.
AH: That's right.
ED: It's a good thing to do.
AH: It's terribly .important. But what are you conserving is the question. Now with rebellion, in our society rebellion means﻿Page 117
abrasiveness, difficult. I got to talk with Melissa Russell the other day and she said, "I knew you when you were abrasive," which was exactly what it would have been described as at that time. And I wasn't. I was reacting to the imposition of society on me, and on mine. And even on other people as I gradually grew up. So I don't know whether--and you take terrorists. Terrorists are patriots if they're fighting for us. If they're opposed to us they're terrorists. Even the Jews got the nerve to talk about terrorists when they would not have had Israel if it hadn't been for some of those people who are really patriots. And more patriots than many I've seen in this generation. So that's--I don't know.
ED: Well, that's an interesting thought, isn't it?
AH: I'd love to find a way of saying it. What, I think I'm going to get into that though with my fourth book.
ED: Fourth? Oh yes, your fourth.
AH: Harlem.
ED: Harlem Mecca?
AH: My Mecca.
ED: My Mecca, yes.
AH: I have to make it "my", I'm having another one...
ED: Continuing the taping of Dr. Anna Arnold Hedgeman, and the date is
now April 23rd, 1979, and Ann and her husband Merritt Hedgeman and I are once again in the Schomburg Library. They were gracious enough to give us this space to continue our taping.
Ann, when we last talked, you were describing to us your experiences with the Federal Social Security System, and we had gotten off the track a little in terms of talking about various very important thoughts that you have. Would you take us now to your relationship, I think you wanted to start off talking about a relationship with a Mary Switzer.
AH: Oh yes. Mary Switzer occupied the same area where I was located, she was the next office to mine, and she at that time was also an assistant to Oscar Ewing. So we had a great deal in common, she was a very thoughtful and experienced woman who had come up through the ranks in an interesting fashion. I think I ought to also say that it was not the federal social security but the Federal Security Agency in which social security was a part of the agency.
Mary Switzer welcomed me warmly, she had been in government a long time. She was a Republican and knew the political scene from the Republican side of the aisle. And having worked on fair employment practices I knew just how important that could be for my general information. As a Democrat I was able to keep up for that side of it, and so I had this combination of experience which was very useful. Both of us worked on general programs across the country.﻿Page 118
We traveled a good bit, visited agencies, parts of the agencies in communities, worked with general community people, and all of my community organization and program development experience really came in handy. We also participated in many conferences around the country, talking with regional representatives and keeping ourselves informed in terms of the general public. The education, I've mentioned before, indicating that Dr. McGrath was the commissioner, that Buell Gallagher was a very able assistant--and we had a large staff--of his faith in conferences on educations of all kinds. For there was a general belief, especially on the part of Buell Gallagher, that if we could educate people to see education in a different sort of relationship that we might have school people ready for the Supreme Court decision which was anticipated to come in '54. A good many people hoped it wouldn't come, of course, and there was considerable turmoil.
ED: Is this the days that Thurgood and group were working on the preparation, or is this too soon.
AH: No, no.
ED: We're in the early fifties now, aren't we?
AH: We were all working with lawyers. We someday must write a real book on the African American lawyer and what he has contributed to the American justice system--in which of course is, by necessity, the whole civil rights movement. And so you had Charles'Houston, George Johnson, George Johnson—Charles Houston, who had established the Howard Law School, and I think I've mentioned him before. He was very active and very effective. Thurgood Marshall was really a sort of disciple of Charles Johnson. And said so when he was being honored on one occasion, and I was very pleased with that,for he was...
MH: A disciple of Charles Houston, not Charles Johnson.
ED: Oh, a disciple of Charles, disciple of, correction by Merritt.
AH: Did I say Johnson? I'm sorry. Thank you, Merritt. By the way,
this is one of the things he does for me continually because so many names can come to him. Charles H. Houston--rather the idol of the lawyers of his time, he died some years back—and very active at that time in Washington. I shall never forget bringing him to the Federal Security Agency to meet with Len Scheele—Dr. Leonard Scheele of the Public Health Service—and members of his staff, to discuss the problems of health among African Americans. And he was simply superb. Thurgood Marshall, as I've said, and George Johnson, and a good many of the other lawyers who were--worked on the Supreme Court decision—had been inspired initially by Charles Houston. Charles had Amherst and Harvard background, and always the deepest of concern about what the law ought to mean to all people, without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin. He was a great gentleman as well, a fantastic student.
ED: And you were saying that Buell Gallagher had this concept of education to enable.﻿Page 119
AH: Buell Gallagher was concerned--you see this was health. In
education, Buell Gallagher was a major factor in trying to bring the superintendents of schools from around the country into some comprehension of the meaning of the struggle for what became the Supreme Court decision of '54. All this was going on and we kept up with it. I mentioned the child situation before, and now that the International Year of the Child is coming, all of that background was very helpful to me as I plan to testify for it shortly. Then, in addition, we had a variety of concerns with social security. Arthur Altmeyer was on that staff, and a very great thinker, and the man who helped develop the social security system. And he would be so upset if he could see the way it threatens to be mangled these days. But we worked with these people on a day by day basis and they used us as they needed us. The international program was particularly important because at that time we were bringing in people from Europe for a special international training.
ED: Was it part of your job, the international affairs?
AH: Everything was, you see. I was over all administrative, so people used me across the board. And I was eager to be used across the board, because I wanted to know as much as I could about the whole picture. In terms of international affairs and foreign students, I was often a guest lecturer for them. And on one occasion we had a group of former Nazis--young, attractive Germans--and they listened to us talk about American democracy and its meaning, and historically the way in which we had attempted to develop a democratic system and democratic education. And when we had finished bringing them up to date, one of them said, "But you in this audience don't know what it is to live under a system where you have to be afraid everyday that justice* may not come to you."
ED: Said by a Nazi student.
AH: Yes. And I stood up and said, "I know. For even in this democracy I've had to live that way. For the African American," (I used the word Negro at that time), "has not ever been without fear, in this, his very beloved country." Well they were so thrilled, and wanted that--some of them wanted to use me continually; others were very disturbed because I had indicated our limitations in this democracy. But as a result of those discussions, we finally set up an international center where we helped train people who were going to be working with foreign guests, and helped also to speak for them and with them. So you see it was a tremendous across-the-board situation. Theresa...
ED: Good experience for your future assignment, the assignment that we want to get to next. What did you start to say about Theresa?
AH: Theresa Wilkins was, for instance, one of the members of the staff of the Office of Education who was attempting to use language as a tool, and working out ways to describe educational scenes in language which would be comprehended abroad.
ED: Was she successful?
AH:
Yes.﻿Page 120
ED: And what is she doing now?
AH: She has retired. She was in Egypt for awhile, and she was in India for awhile, and talked about her international experiences with people. Meantime, Mary Taylor, who was in the Children's Bureau, and a very effective public relations person for Children's programs, was married to Donald Montgomery, who was the Washington representative of Walter Reuther of the United Automobile Workers.
ED: So these are white people you're speaking of.
AH: These are white people, and were great friends. When the
difficulties came as a result of the McCarthy era—we all lived through that when we had to be investigated. We were handed interrogatories and asked "Did you ever distribute a leaflet in such-and-such a time."
ED: Your Washington experience was during the period that McCarthyism was rampant.
AH: Was very rampant.
ED: It's being celebrated today, you know, April 23, because I believe that his investigations began twenty--shouldn't say celebrated, being acknowledged--that this is the twenty-fifth year since the opening of the McCarthy hearings. April 25th, I believe it was.
AH: That's right, it's one of the reasons I mentioned them today, I knew that this was coming. It was a horrible period.
ED: You were in Washington during this period.
AH: A young, white woman from our staff came to me one day to know what to do. She had received an interrogatory and an interview, and she was asked did she receive African American guests in her home. And she said she didn't know quite how to answer it, she didn't want to get anybody in trouble, but she had had friends in college who now worked in Washington as she did, and of course they'd been to her home. And what should she say? So I said, "You tell them the exact truth, exactly why, and explain that you have enjoyed knowing them. And then be sure to tell those Negroes who are being interviewed al so that you've done it so that they can explain in the same way." And did all that sort of thing, helping people work out these interrogatories. And then my own came and that was really fascinating.
I was asked whether or not I had contributed to a Southern school. They knew the name, the man's name was Claude Williams, I'll never forget it that I had known him. Well I couldn't think of anybody with a name of Claude Williams at the moment, or of the sharecropping school they mentioned. However, later I found, through talking with another member of the staff, that this Claude Williams had headed this sharecroppers' school in the South, and had been a guest of the Young Women's Christian Association in Washington--not in Washington, I'm sorry, in New York--in New York City.﻿Page 121
ED: Probably National Board.
AH: Yes. And, since it was about sharecropping, and I had suffered with sharecroppers in Mississippi, I know I must have made a contribution. But at the time they asked me, I didn't know it. I was also asked if I was a Communist, of course, and I explained that I'd had so much difficulty trying to secure my part of American democracy that I had no time to study Communism. And I didn't know whether that was too brash an answer, but it was the actual truth. So that period was a horrible one.
ED: About two years, a year and a half?
AH: Oh, it was more than that.
ED: Intense, the intense part of it.
AH: It was very intense most of the time because he just built and
built, and he had an outgoing kind of personality, and people were playing what they call conservative games, as we are now. And it was really a difficult time.
Well in the meantime I wanted very much to--as I talked with Mary Taylor and Don Montgomery, her husband, in their lovely little home in Washington, I became interested in Chester Bowles as ambassador in India. I had known Chester Bowles in New York City, he was quite--we called him Chet Bowles here--he was quite a personable and intelligent person with great sense of people. And Mary said, "I think, with all the things you've been doing, you ought to go to India." Well I said, "I'd love it." And so they contacted Chet Bowles, who was a great friend of theirs, and the ambassador made a formal request—because he also remembered me--to Washington that I come to India. Well, that was a very exciting...
ED: So we embark on India now.
AH: Yes. The difficulty of getting a passport was tied both to the
emphasis that McCarthy had placed on many kinds of people--Jews and some Catholics, and always, always Negroes--as probably Communist leaning.
ED: Pinkos, isn't that his favorite word?
AH: Yes, well that was one of--yes, that was one of his favorite words. So that Mary and Don believed that it was important that some of us have an opportunity to go into India, and other parts of the world for that matter. The difficulty of getting a passport was tremendous. Lester Granger was going, and they wouldn't give him one. It was just that tough and restrictive a period. Mine didn't come and it didn't come. The woman in charge of the International Office, whose name does not come to me at this moment [Ellen Woodward], was originally from Mississippi. And she worked for me to go too, which was kind of interesting. So that forces that you would not have expected were interested. The Service let me take all my tests, and I had my application for the visa in, and everybody was working on it. Finally, a couple days before﻿Page 122
Thanksgiving of .1952, that passport came. And on Thanksgiving day I took off for India.
ED: How did you travel, Ann? Air or...
AH: I traveled by air, at that time we went to Newfoundland first, and
then to England, France, Rome, and then on the long trek into India. First time I had been out of this continent, and the first time I'd had that sense of being isolated from everything I had previously known, or seen or done.
ED: Did you travel to these different cities stopping, or were those only stops for the plane?
AH: These were stops for the plane at that time.
ED: So you didn't go into these cities.
AH: No.
ED: India was where you first got off the ship.
AH: Well you did go in in a fashion because you were in airports, and you saw so many people, and you kind of had a feel of the country even without going out into the town. Later, of course, I did the other in visitations.
ED: So India was your first place outside the continental United States.
AH: That's right.
ED: To actually visit.
AH: To actually spend time. I was on three-months assignment. And with my previous experience that you have on tapes, I was able to really know that I would understand more than many people would.
ED: And as you said to us in that earlier tape, you understood
retrospectively much that had happened in Mississippi, anew, after the India experience.
AH: Yes. It reemphasized and re-related to the world, actually. I'll never forget arriving... Oh, we had stopped also in--after Rome--Istanbul, then Beirut, which I loved, and then into India.
ED: Landing in New Delhi?
AH: Landing in New Delhi with friends meeting us. One of them, Evelyn Hershey, who was the social worker--the only federal social worker we had around the world--in India--and I had worked with her in Philadelphia in the International Institute, so that we had an immediate bond, and she was there to meet me.
ED: Now did you say this is the only social worker the United States had in the world? Interesting.﻿Page 123
AH: Yes. She was what was called a Social Worker Attache, in Ambassador Bowles's setup.
ED: How long was he there, I'm just digressing for a minute to say something.
AH: I'm not sure.
ED: Because I had--again our paths join a little bit. For the YWCA in 1967 I was one of twenty-six women: I was their volunteer leader of a group that traveled around the world, studying problems in YWCAs and comparing and sharing and learning from each other. And when we arrived in New Delhi, which was our sixth or seventh city, I believe Chester Bowles was still the ambassador, because it was in July.
AH: Might well have been.
ED: ...and he had us to his July Fourth party there, at the ambassador's house.
AH: What year?
ED: 1967.
AH: He may have been. He was the--a person who would have done that. When we were in India we were a large group, and he had us to the embassy, living in his home for the whole Christmas season, he and Mrs. Bowles. She, of course...
ED: Generous people, weren't they, lovely people.
AH: Mrs. Bowles was just as perfect as she could be. The two of them
are what I wish every American ambassador and wife could be like, it was just that real. And they had set up--along'with Evelyn Hershey--a tremendous program for us. We visited ten principal cities and we went...
ED: Did you go into Calcutta?
AH: No. We had an appointment in Calcutta, and I was dying to go because I had known Tagore.
ED: Oh! Had known him in the United States.
AH: In the United States. And I was so anxious to go.
ED: Now identify for our audience because...
AH: Tagore, a great Indian philosopher...
ED: Right.
AH: ...who had come--a Brahmin, an aristocrat in other words--who had
come to New York City, and a couple of us spent our last two dollars and a half to hear him at Carnegie Hall.
ED: He would talk, and also wouldn't he recite poetry?﻿Page 124
AH: He may have, I only remember that he was fantastic, and he made this speech which kind of pulled everybody together instantly...
ED: I remember those days.
AH: ...and then went on to say, "I have enjoyed visiting your city. You have taken me to see the largest buildings, and to the streetcorner where the most people pass. And you have shown me your museums. And you've talked with me about your democracy. But nobody has said to me, "There're some great personalities I'd like to have you know,' and I don't quite understand that." So I wanted to go to Calcutta, and see if I could have an opportunity to talk with him again. But, they had a riot there the day we were to leave for Calcutta, and we did not get there. But I did most of the other principal cities.
ED: Did you get to Bangalore?
AH: Yes.
ED: Do you remember? And the Theological Seminary there?
AH: Yes. Although I did not do much with the theological and Christian people there. I had the opposite experience from you. Because I had not before understood that Christianity was such a minor factor. I just had never known it, and so I was anxious to find out more about the Indian religions and religious expressions. And Christians seemed so, how do I say it?. . .
ED: North European?
AH: They were North European, and very consciously North European. And they hadn't really emerged, although there were always individuals who had moved beyond that. But on the whole, the YWCA Christians had a little tea for us, and I could have cried because...
ED: I went to so many of those teas around the world.
AH: They just didn't fit, you know?
ED: No. But one of the things that was interesting, I thought, about the YWCA in India, was the way that it really brought together the Moslems, the Hindus, and so we had a totally different situation than you have in YWCA in the United States. I mean, the president might be a woman who was a Moslem.
AH: But you see they did this there because they had to. They had no
clientele. And this--they therefore--they didn't quite meet. They were there. But each was there, rather than the beginnings of real discussion of what these religions were about, why they were this way or that way.
ED: I think they'd made some advances by '67 because there was a great openness, and not the usual Christian stance of knowing all the answers.﻿Page 125
AH: Well they had to, you see, because they...
ED: I guess they had learned.
AH: That's why I began looking at the others; I knew they had to, and I wanted to know what they'd found that I hadn't found. The--what was it? The village workers were of especial interest to me, because one knew that the crowds of people in cities were not easily within your reach, and so the opportunity to sit with actual village workers and with villagers themselves gave new insight to the meaning of "village" in India as compared to "village" in the United States. You see, I began to realize the missionaries' problem, and the Anglo problem, as these people attempted to understand a whole different picture. You compare an English village or a United States village with the thatched roofs, with the dung floors, with babies on those dung floors, and flies practically eating them up.
ED: And cows right outside the door.
AH: Oh, cows everywhere. Cows in Bombay in the center of the city, with automobiles going around them.
ED: Right. The sacred cow.
AH: Yes. And in addition, the village itself with so little of any
human comfort. No beds, no furniture, an old mat thrown up in the corner for...
ED: Eight and nine people to one little hut.
AH: Eight and nine and in even the apartments, the "chawls" as they call them in Bombay, one saw as many as fifteen people sleeping almost on top of each other in these little compartments with the stench almost unbearable. And I also...
ED: What part of your work took you into the village, I mean, what aspect?
AH: I went to see India, and to know India as much as I could in a three months period.
ED: Yes, O.K. I still am going to push you a little. How? Did you
walk to the villages, did you take a bus out and walk through? In the instance that I--we had--the YWCA had a feeding program and a sewing program, and this sort of thing. And so we had a kind of natural introduction to the villages. How did a government representative, how did you effect this?
AH: Wait. Evelyn Hershey was the planner..
ED: As the social worker. *
AH: Yes, had planned so that at each community there was someone of the community to receive us.
ED: You and Evelyn, or more?﻿Page 126
AH: Oh, the whole group. There were about twenty of us I guess.
ED: Oh, tell me more about this. I didn't quite get this. I thought you were the only one that went over.
AH: No, there were twenty or more people going for different reasons. I mentioned, for instance, that Whitney Young was in the delegation. Many of them came from communities in the United States, and we were ■ all together.
ED: This was a project, in other words, for three months.
AH: It was a visit for three months; it was not a project.
ED: A visit for three months of several people.
AH: Of many people.
ED: I see. From different walks.
AH: And who--people who were interested in, for one reason or another. One or two were from foundations, for example. One or two were university people. Whitney Young was the National Urban League. It was that quality of group. However, we had our own individual schedules, dependent upon our backgrounds and what we wanted to do, and different people wanted different kinds of experiences. I wanted everything, and so I asked Evelyn to set up a very inclusive schedule for me, and having known me she understood that, and did. So that I had re-manned homes, old folks' setups, and I say it that way because one of them I saw was a great room and older people just piled up in the back almost like old rags. And I, for the first time, resented deeply the CARE packages, and the feeding bits that we did, for I knew that they needed over there seeds.
ED: Which they later realized, didn't they?
AH: Some, not...
ED: Yes, because some of the CARE packages now say seeds and plows and...
AH: Yes, but you see this is...
ED: They didn't then.
AH: Not an adequate program. And I saw it, I'm glad it's there,
somebody lived by it. But it was awfully difficult to accept the fact that the United States was sending CARE packages and not recognizing that the needs had to do with agricultural tools. I worked with some of the agricultural workers also, in going back into the villages, and one of them said, as a trainer of young men going into the villages, "You have your new seeds, and you know from experience here that they will produce. You have new methods. You're learning to put a strip of metal on your little plow, on the little wooden plows, so you can make it more effective. You know the importance of this kind of food. Now, as you go into the villages, teach people the value of these things, and remember﻿Page 127
you've just learned it, so don't be too hard on them if they have not quite caught on." One of the very effective workers, by the way, was out of Tuskegee Institute, where he had learned to make a , certain kind of brick, and had learned also the importance of the soil to people anywhere in the Asiatic, African kind of world background.
ED: This was a precursor of, you know the program, you know the program I'm speaking of...
AH: AID?
ED: No. Oh, Peace Corps. The concept here is the concept of the Peace Corps, is it not? Going into a village and becoming a member,of the community...
AH: Yes, yes, and working with them. But you see they didn't have the
proper backup, because we—our international world—should have been saying that Europe, West Indies, United States, South America, Canada have all built on products out of that part of the world. And have not worked out adequate trade agreements which make it possible for people to do for themselves, and yet we talk goodly that they must do for themselves. And we're still at that spot, of course. So all of this hunger program, which we embrace so hungrily because we wanted to do something, is also a part of that failure to insist the government do the kind of trade development, product exchange development, decent economic, money—decent money—for the products we purchased. All of this need, needed to be done, and still needs to be done. I never shall forget during the civil rights struggle of the sixties when the National Council of Negro Women was taking groups to develop food for these Southern Negroes,
[Tape off/Tape on]
AH: When the need was for basic economic planning at an international level, and in our case at the national level. Unfortunately, the World Development Bank even has not thought in that fashion. And so we've had CARE programs, and hungry--programs for the hungry in the South--and we've had all sorts of pleas that people learn to take care of themselves without recognizing that we have taken their products, produced from them—no question about that—but failed to adequately compensate them. And this was the same problem there, and of course it's the problem that's now rocking Africa and parts of Asia, wherever people have not had adequate respect for themselves and for their products.
ED: We make this mistake over and over again.
AH: Over and over again, because it does mean that we have to plan to have less...
ED: For ourselves.
AH: Yes. And to stop doing what I sometimes call—in order to really shake people up—stealing everything that isn't tacked down and failing to adequately compensate for it. And this goes on over and over and over again. And this was for me the great lesson of India,﻿Page 128
along with the variety of their culture, fantastic variety. And the bravery of the people who live in those villages. And the courage of men digging a well with shovels. I saw men deep in a well passing up buckets of sand when they ought to have had the machinery to do it with. And I saw the beginning of the automobile industry, with the countries sending in the already made materials expecting these people to put them together. And even this was a beginning, a little bit of a beginning of industry. And I saw beginnings of the trade union movement. And the struggles of some of the women who were concerned with the young widows in India, parked aside from society and needing support of many kinds. And the problems of children were almost unbelievable.
ED: Some advance in terms of having the children in nurseries beside the working mother, did you notice that?
AH: Yes--oh no. That had not begun. There was much discussion of that. There was a beginning of a social work program. And the first graduates, I met with the first graduates on their way to participate in industry, because industry agreed to take them on. There was no one else who could afford them. And in the process, we were asked whether the industry--the industry people--should evaluate their work. We didn't have sense enough to know that this was the first group, that the people receiving them wouldn't know how to evaluate them, and what had to be done was to inspire these young people who were going in with some preparation to give their best toward the health of India. And I had the unique experience of meeting with the great conference held there on violence/nonviolence in the kind of world we live in, with the great philosophers. Ralph Bunche represented the United States, Radhakrishnan the great Indian philosopher was there, and Lord Boyd [Orr], from England, and the wife of the educational minister, Mrs. Hamayun Kabir made it possible for me to sit in. It was not open to all the delegates, and I didn't tell them that I was going because I didn't want to upset her, but she did get me into that conference. And there was...
ED: What a wonderful time to be there.
AH: There was one of Nehru's family there who looked exactly like my
mother, and we sat and held hands during the conference after I told her that. We also, of course, met Indira Gandhi. A tremendous woman, who--with whom I suffered as she was being exiled, and because after all she had understood...
ED: Her recent exile.
AH: She understood the West too well, and I knew it. This bothered me.
ED: What a good way to put it. We had audience with her, but she was worried. Maybe the day we were there or the period we were there, because she didn't give very much to us.
AH: She really never did.
ED: No, as a victim of...﻿Page 129
AH: She was very much inside herself. Very arrogant. I loved her arrogance.
ED: [laughs] I didn't. But that's interesting.
AH: I just loved her arrogance. You see, we created...
ED: We helped make her that way.
AH: People from the West created... There is also a touch of that in many, many Indians. Plus...
ED: Yes, that's true.
AH: Yes, just a touch of it. And part of it, you see, is their long history of having to battle the arrogant, the really arrogant.
ED: So they took, they took on the dressings of the oppressor you're saying, right?
AH: No, no.
ED: No? In having to battle...
AH: They reacted to the oppressor, and having been that way myself I
know exactly what happens. You know in yourself that they are not the superior beings they pretend or they present, because they don't really pretend as much. They think they are. They're not that, and we know it intimately, and yet they presume.to treat you as though you were inferior and they were superior.
ED: Right. Now tell me about the reaction to this.
AH: So, the reaction to this is to know that you have a superiority they don't comprehend, and a humanity they have not been willing to recognize. And so you let them have it.
ED: By giving it right back to them.
AH: No. By being yourself. So completely.
ED: Oh, and this is what you think we interpret as arrogance on the part of the Indian, but...
AH: Yes, yes.
ED: Their being themselves, the recognition of who they really are.
AH: They know who they are, and they know who we are not.
ED: Americans.
AH: Yes. And not only American, the European ones too. Oh the British were a little smarter.
I never shall forget talking with the woman who was the prime radio producer for all of India, for Air India. She had made a little﻿Page 130
speech that irritated me because she had practically said, "I have just come because protocol requires it." And I knew there was a story there so I went to her office and asked for an appointment and got it, and I said to her, "Would you tell me why you dislike us so?" And I put it as boldly as that on purpose. And she looked at me, she said, "I don't dislike you. I don't dislike Americans in general. Many of them bore me. And I don't know why I have to go to a cocktail party in order to chat with them a bit. Their opposite numbers really pay little attention to our work and our thinking and our doing and our being." She was a beautiful woman too, and here she was from a very distinguished family of attorneys in India.
ED: So you just understood completely why she...
AH: I understood from having been Negro, as they say, in America. And the way in which I had often looked at them and said, "Poor people. They, they are so stupid." And yet how do you tell them in a way in which will be helpful? And then suddenly one day you get tired and you just let them have your total arrogance. And I always think of Indira Gandhi in those terms. Mrs. Kabir was quite different.
ED: Very interesting.
AH: She knew that we were all upset and unaware, and so she tried to feed in what you needed, and that's why she let me come into the conference. Where the Indian philosophers really stood out even...
ED: This was a world conference.
AH: Yes.
ED: On non-violence.
AH: Yes. What they called "Non-violence in a World of Conflict."
ED: What year would this be: '51, '52...
AH: Fifty-three. Fifty-three, because I stayed in India until March of ' 53 .
ED: I was going to ask you, you went for three months assignment, was it three months or did you get it extended?
AH: No, I did not ask for an extension because I wanted to come home actually.
ED: Merritt was at home.
AH: Merritt was at home, and this...
ED: You couldn't wangle a trip for him at the same time?
AH: It was the longest we had been separated. No, I had a hard time getting there myself. He put me on the plane to go, and I was grateful for that.﻿Page 131
ED: These days he was heavy into concerts, is that right? That was taking up a lot of his time?
AH: Yes. Taking up a great deal of time.
ED: You were living in Washington both of you?
AH: At this time, yes, we were living in Washington. He was with the Recorder of Deeds, Marshall Shepard, I think I put that in the record the other day.
ED: I don't--I think you did Marshall Shepard, but I don't believe you mentioned that Merritt was with him.
AH:	And also doing--studying at Peabody, and...
ED:	Peabody Institute...
AH:	Yes.
ED:	In Washington.
AH:	In Baltimore.
ED:	In Baltimore, right.
AH:	And, in addition, doing concerts here and there, that sort of thing.
ED:	Where did you live?
AH:	And a radio program.
ED:	In Washington.
AH:	Yes.
ED:	He was on a radio program or conducting one?
AH:	On a radio program.
ED:	On a radio program, yes. And where did you live? People sometimes doing research like to know where great people lived in a particular city. Do you remember where you lived in Washington?
AH: When I went to the Federal Security Agency, I asked at Howard
University for places where people might find housing. And I was sent to a man and wife, husband and wife: the wife a teacher, the husband a psychiatrist. They had a big house and said they might take in a stranger. And so I went to see them and it was very funny. She is definitely an Italian looking woman, and I didn't know whether I was visiting--and he's fair--and I didn't know whether I was visiting an Italian family or a French family because the name was Prudhomme.
ED: Pardon me?
AH: Prudhomme: P-R-U-D-H-O-M-M-E.﻿Page 132
ED: Wow, Prudhomme. Prude man.
AH: My husband, at that point, was in North Carolina in the Air Force. ED: Oh, I see.
AH: And one of the reasons I was going to go to Washington was I figured it was nearer and we could visit.
ED: I think you told us that on one of the tapes.
AH: Yes, I did, I think so, yes. So I lived there while he was in the Service. Then he came home...
ED: Was this a white or a black family?
AH: Oh, it was African American.
ED: Pardon me.
AH: Very much so.
ED: Right.
AH: And Mrs. Prudhomme had been, at one time, the wife of the first one of us to have a penthouse in New York. So I knew her background although I had not met her. She'd taught English in the whole time and hadn't ever moved anywhere.
ED:	What was her married name at that time, do you recall?
AH:	Prudhomme. Oh, when she was here?
ED:	I'm trying to get historically one of the first penthouses.
AH:	Yeah, at 409 Edgecombe.
ED:	Oh, at 409.
AH:	At 409.
ED:	And you don't remember her name. We lived at 409 in the forties.
AH:	Yes. What was Redra's child's name?
MH:	Jeanne.
AH:	What?
MH:	Clifford.
AH:	Clifford.
ED:	Oh, Jay Clifford. Right, right.﻿Page 133
AH:	And Jay Clifford had gone to Paris, remember, and we were there at the end, and he and Redra were divorced. But...
ED:	And this was now Redra Prudhomme.
AH:	They had this daughter.
ED:	Oh, this was their daughter.
AH:,	This was, no. This was his first wife.
ED:	Mrs. Clifford, now Mrs. Prudhonime.
AH:	That's right. And they had a daughter Jeanne, but she was in school. So I lived there until Merritt came out of the Army.
ED:	And where was that, Ann?
AH:	1752 Seventeenth Street Northwest..
ED:	O.K. 1752 Seventeenth Street Northwest.
AH:	And we moved from there to...
ED:	You and Merritt?
AH:	Um-hum. When he came out of the Army...
ED:	When he came out of the service.
AH:	... we really, really wanted an apartment.
ED:	The Army?
MH:	We took an apartment out at a new building project.
AH:	There was a new development, a private development, a beautiful place.
ED:	Outside of Washington?
AH:	Northeast Washington.
ED:	Northeast. Did you say...
MH:	Mayfair.
ED:	Mayfair! Oh yes, I've heard of that.
AH:	Mayfair apartments, they had just opened and...
ED:	Right. Was he, you said "came out of the Army." Was he in the Army?
AH:	Out of the Air Force.
ED:	Air Force. I thought you had said Air Force before.﻿Page 134
AH: All of it's Army as far as I'm concerned. I always mix 'em up because...
ED: Purposely.
AH: ...I'm non-defense.
ED: Right. And now to think that Clifford Alexander, whom we all knew as a baby, is in charge of the Army. Well, where are we now, Ann? We are back from India, we're about to come back from India?
AH:	We were, I guess we'd better come back from India because...
ED:	I think we'd better come back from India, right.
AH:	Because I could talk about India all day,.
ED:	I see, yes, your, your depth of understanding on...
AH: I even went to a union meeting and I went to factories where they were assembling cars and talked with union leaders, and one night had an experience which really excited me because we...
ED: We're in India.
AH: In India, in New Delhi. We met under the roof of the sheds of the railroad station. And they took us around the corner for our refreshments, and guess what they had? Coca-Cola! Do you see what I'm talking about?
ED:	Oh yes.
AH:	And who brought Coca-Cola around the world?
ED:	Yes.
AH:	Who did, do you remember?
ED:	I was going to say Americans.
AH:	Farley, Farley, the great political leader in the United States.
MH:	James Farley.
AH:	James H. Farley.
ED:	You mean in a business fashion?
AH:	Yes!
ED:	After he left government.
MH:	Yeah.
ED:
He had a job with Pepsi-Cola?﻿Page 135
MH: Coca-Cola.
ED: Coca-Cola.
MH: It all had to do with foreign...
AH: Public relations for them, Coca-Cola.
ED: That was his title.
AH: This shows you that we could have the power of our multi-national
corporations, we could have been related to the total picture. The same thing of course was true in other parts of the world.
ED: Ann, weren't you impressed in India with the activity politically of the women as compared to the women in our country? I know I remember they remonstrated once with us about having one woman, Margaret Chase Smith, at that time in the Senate, as compared to their Senate where the Vice-President was a woman and where many of the senators were women. And they said, you know, "You American women should be ashamed of yourselves."
AH: Well, the Minister of Health for all India was a woman.
ED: Weren't you impressed with... Of course, you know, it's a new
country in the sense of the new government, and someone pointed out to me that because the Indian women had fought for the liberation of their country beside their men, naturally when the government itself was formed, it meant that positions naturally went to them.
AH: Yes, but always countries around the world have had some women they let through which does not mean liberation for women in India. Or those widows wouldn't be stuck.
ED: Yes. But women in India are in decision-making positions.
AH: But, some women always have been abroad. We have been less aware of that and have pushed our women at top levels less than most of the countries of the world. But they still are an elite group, is what I want to point out.
ED: Yes, you're still pointing out that they're the women that they let get through.
AH: To further emphasize the importance of top-level women in India one ought to mention that a Miss [Mehra] Masani of the famous psychologist family of India was head of radio for all India. And I've mentioned already that there was a woman who was responsible for the health of all India. And Mme. Pandit, you know, was a representative here. And Mrs. Kabir was working with all the educational forces in India. All of these people in areas where, at the time, we had less representation.
Before we leave India I think I'd like to sort of summarize it by saying three major events which will remain with me. The very first one I've mentioned is the conference on "Non-violence in a World of Conflict," and that has stayed with me through the years and been﻿Page 136
very helpful as I reviewed the things that had to be said. And as I recall, Radhakrishnan's hope, expressed by Gandhi incidentally, that the United States and the world would not be taken over by machines, and that the humanity of all of us would be increasingly valuable in the development of the world.
And a session of Nehru in his lovely room there, with roses in the background, and Nehru in a white costume saying to us emphatically, "We are going to try to have you see as much of India as possible in your three months stay with us, but, we hope you will not go home experts on India. I have been studying her intimately for forty years, and each day turns up some new facet." And I thought that was valuable for all of us who move around our own country and discover new sights within it, and as we move around the world.
I taught school at the Madras School of Social Work for a short period, and there met two important facets of India. One of them--both of them in my classroom, incidentally. We were talking about community organization and its importance, and one of the young women said, "Will you tell us about the Community Fund in America?" And having been part of the Community Fund system I explained in detail what it was about. And when I was through they all looked disappointed. And I asked why. I did sense it and I'm so glad I did, for the answer was, "We thought that the community fund was a fund of money given to the community by the city to do with as they pleased." It shows you how things can be distorted. As I talked with them about our young people, about education for everyone as a kind of presumption in this country, even when we didn't really achieve it fully, and as I talked about the history of the democratic society, there were many questions. But also much interest. When I explained that young people did much hard work to raise money to go to school, that they didn't always lean on their parents--and this was a class, by the way, of, well I suppose one says upper class Indians.
There seemed to be response by only one student. And he kept offering comments at very interesting moments, and sensing that I was trying to say that all of us have responsibilities for helping ourselves as much as we can. Well those young people sitting in front of me, in many instances, had never ironed a sari, had never polished a shoe, had never done anything for themselves personally because there were other Indians available to do it for very little money. And this was a new experience to hear me talk of... Americans are supposed to be wealthy. All of us, by the way, as you know, are supposed to be wealthy over there; that they would be doing work, physical work. There was one person who listened and kept commenting that "all of us here don't have those opportunities," he kept saying. After the session I talked with him, and he was the leader of the untouchables of India. And he took me to their operation where I had a chance to see young people learning to do many kinds of things that they would need in their older life. And that was an unforgettable experience. And I also went to one of the untouchable villages. And over--they were over in the corner of another village, you see, not supposed to be related to the total village. And I went to a meeting of the chiefs as they talked about the untouchables. And the untouchables were﻿Page 137
there, but not with or a part of the whole situation. I think those are the major things'that impressed me.
ED: Three outstanding events, experiences.
AH: And of course the attendance at the union meetings, I mentioned before, was also an extraordinary experience.
ED:- And getting to know the villages.
AH: And getting to know the villages, and to see that they were learning to use the greenery around, which was helpful, but also the desperate need for new seeds, and the desperate need for water. And for health facilities of all kinds. And I went to an inoculation ceremony, really, in the streets of India, where they were trying to immunize young people. And of course always the chawls with their stench and bodies piled high and no furniture. Women making bread for children with soiled hands. And you know just so many of the massively...
ED: You used the word, pardon me; and massively what?
AH: Massively important problems.
ED: ' Yes. You speak of the Charles...?
AH: Chawls. I believe you spell it C-H-A-W-L-S. They're the apartment houses, and I went to the apartment houses.
ED: Yes. Well Ann, you came back to America at the end of your three months and back to the federal government?
AH: Back to the Federal Security Agency where...
ED: Was your job waiting for you?
AH: Yes, I was expected back, of course. However, in the interim, the election had brought us Dwight Eisenhower as President, and that meant a Republican administration, and since I was a political appointee I could well be expected to resign. I did not immediately, because I was asked to train the new person, to orient the new person is a better word, to give her an idea of the scope of the job and the tremendous responsibilities involved. She however--oh, in the meantime I was asked to make a report on my trip to India, and the, most of the Federal Security Agency staff turned out for that report.
ED: Oh, you gave it orally.
AH: I gave it orally. And I also wrote it.
ED: And is there a copy of it?
AH: I have a copy of it, and I tried to warn "social work" of some of the problems that they may not have quite comprehended. And that had come out of a session at the University of Baroda where I was part of a panel which included a Greek, and one other member from﻿Page 138
the United States, who considered herself really a top-flight social worker.
ED: This was in India? A conference?
AH: In India, yes.
ED: Baroda?
AH: Yes, yes. And I reported on that because the challenge for social workers rested in the fact that we were taking the standards we had set, and immediately applying them to a social worker's practice, social work practice which was in the beginning, and in a totally different kind of setting. And someone said, "Well we think it's important that you evaluate the workers periodically." And someone else said--our--really our Greek who was present said, "You know, you can't evaluate until you've had a chance to know first what you're doing in the new setting and what the new setting thinks of you, and maybe whether you can just hold the job." [laughter]
So I reported all of this and made some suggestions that I thought pertinent in terms of the situation in India, and in terms of our relationship to it. And then shortly thereafter...
ED: Pardon me, about the report, is a copy of that available so that maybe we could attach it to this report? To this taping?
AH: I think I could arrange that.
ED: I think that would be good.
AH: And then I decided that I was going to resign. My husband and I had a conference. Tried to figure out whether we wanted to stay in Washington or come back to New York, and we decided that both of us knew New York best and that our best opportunities might be here. And so we bravely packed up and put our savings together. I had spent his last bonus check, by the way, for Fair Employment Practices, so that I had limited the budget immediately. We went...
ED: You had spent it for, you mean you had contributed to...?
AH: Yes! Generous philanthropy on the part of a very poor woman. We came back to New York...
ED: Did you have some place waiting here for you?
AH: No, we had given up our apartment. And my mother and father-in-law, who'd had a home in the Bronx, had died in the interim and all of our home relationships were gone. So, we went to the Theresa. The Theresa Hotel was open...
ED: I remember when you lived there.
AH: Yes. And I smiled a bit about it because there was a time when the Theresa Hotel was no-man's land, even for Harlem neighbors. But we had a suite there...﻿Page 139
ED: They were taking in African American people.
AH: Yes, it was...
ED: A few.
AH: No, no. This was by this time fully African American. And we had a suite of rooms.
ED: We need to identify Hotel Theresa for our present day audience.
AH: Located at the corner of 125th Street and Seventh Avenue in my beloved Harlem and in New York City which I've always loved too.
ED: It's on the southwest corner, and it is now the same building, the big white building, but the...
AH: It's now very much of an educational center.
ED: Educational center, I was just going to say, with New York University, or...?
AH: No, it's a state. It's an extension of state, but it also has New
York City community college relationships, I'm not quite sure of all that detail, but I am sure that there is a program there because I've spoken for students there recently, and the man in charge is probably the United States's most fantastic educator, George--Andrew George Donaldson. But at that time, of course, it was'a straight hotel, with...
ED: Yes, right. It was formerly an all white hotel in the middle of Harlem.
AH: That's right. And a resident, they had the hotel rooms of course and also a breakfast, a snack bar, and a restaurant itself.
ED: And a wonderful ballroom, on the top, where all those wonderful parties were given.
AH: Oh, the ballroom on the top floor.
ED: O.K., so you stayed there for awhile, or quite awhile?
AH: For quite awhile. We were trying to figure out what to do, and a number of citizens of Harlem came to talk with me about politics. It happened that Wagner, Robert F. Wagner, was running for mayor of the city. And a great many people were interested in him.
ED: This was Robert Wagner, junior, his father was the senator.
AH: His father was the famous senior, famous senior senator really, who had been responsible for a good deal of labor legislation and was kind of a patron saint of New York City. Robert Jr. was running and it occurred to me that he... It occurred to me that Robert Wagner had an interesting background with which to enter the political arena, and of course I knew that he had been borough president and﻿	
	Page 140
	had been in the housing field. His father also had the reputation, which was useful to him. And that's about all I thought of it, until several Harlem residents came to me and brought me a clipping from The New York Times which said that Mr. Wagner was looking for competent people for his slate. And they had decided that I ought to be a member of his slate.
	Well this was an interesting idea, but I knew full well that I had some handicaps. First of all, I had been out of the city for ten years. Now I had been back and forth from Washington serving the community in many capacities, but who bothers in politics to remember such details. And I knew that it would be said that I was a stranger to my own town. The other handicap was the fact that I was a woman, and I had learned long since that it's easier to be a Negro, be Jewish, Spanish, or any other "obnoxious" portion of society than be woman in terms of political life, and that was particularly true at that time. So I explained all of this to them and they still insisted that there was no harm in presenting my name.
ED:	They were looking for an African American, because you didn't name that as a handicap.
AH:	No, no. I didn't name that, I said I'd rather be all of those things. Didn't I mention that?
ED:	Yes, yes.
AH:	That's right.
ED:	But, you named your two handicaps: being out of town and being a woman.
AH:	And woman, yes. And woman is, as I said, more important.
ED:	Right, but also being an African American.
AH:	That is always in, remember? I've said that all through these tapes. That no matter what anyone suffers, the immigrant or...
ED:	O.K. , all right...
AH:	...or citizen of the country, we have that extra responsibility. And remember I used Charlotte Carr's famous statement: "Leave here. I'll likely appoint you today. It's tough enough to be a woman, but to be a Negro woman must be pure hell!"
ED:	Whose was that?
AH:	Charlotte Carr, who was the Commissioner of Welfare, remember?
ED:	Now, let me just ask you something. They were not looking for an African American to--on the slate?
AH:	Not at that time, there was no objection.
ED:	They picked you because of your competency and experience.
	﻿Page 141
AH: There was no statement made, and I would assume that if one came
along, they figured it was useful politically, they would take them. And of course Wagner would be expected to, since he was billed as a liberal. So that I didn't think about anything, really, but the woman end of it and the absence from town.
In the meantime these people were very insistent, and I said, "Well if you face the fact that announcing the interest may not produce any results, I would be interested." Meantime Frank E. Karelsen--K-A-R-E-L-S-E-N--long-time Jewish friend of mine, called me and said, "You ought to run on the Wagner ticket." And I said, "Fine, if Mr. Wagner thinks so," and left it right there. Meantime the Harlem citizens sent a release to the Times and the other newspapers, there were several newspapers as you remember at that time. And. sent them to all the press. And it gathered a pretty good press, a paragraph which said that I had been requested to run.
Well, Wagner's office--campaign office--got in touch with me. And I had an appointment with Stanley Lowell. And when Stanley looked at my credentials, he was very excited about it and made an appointment with me to see Wagner. Wagner was very gracious, but talked all over the place, and I knew full well when I left that he was not considering me. In the meantime...
ED: Pardon me, what position did they want you to run for?
AH: Borough president.
ED: Borough president of Manhattan.
AH: Borough president of Manhattan. And of course, at that time the Borough presidency was an important office, because much of the political patronage went through that office. They had changed that, however, and changed it very much before it was over, but at that time it was really a power spot. So I really grinned at that one, knowing full well that that would not come to a woman.
ED: This was quite a mark of respect that you--you know--esteem--that they...
AH: I was very pleased with that because it was absolutely unsolicited. And as you know most political people like to say that, because it sounds very good for clientele, but in this case that was really it.
ED: There was no way you could have been soliciting, you've been off in India and Washington the last ten years.
AH: And had been around enough, but as they say that's always forgotten. Well in the meantime, I knew that this wouldn't happen, but I kept my eye on the political picture, and I discovered that they were calling around the country to find Negro men who were not in the city at the moment and who lived here. For instance they went after Thurgood Marshall. And I recognized that the suggestion of these citizens had made them remember that they ought to have a Negro on the ticket, so at least we'd accomplished that much. They went after--and also they asked Channing Tobias, who incidentally was a﻿Page 142
Republican, but at the same time the quality of person who had ranged all over the place and could well have been of service there.
ED: Had he been to India before you, or was it to come later that he...?
AH: I honestly don't know. I knew...
ED: He had some assignment in India, and then with the U.N. before he died.
AH: I know he had the U.N. assignment and was in Paris, but I don't know about the Indian one.
ED: I think there was an assignment.
AH: It could have been, easily.
ED: Channing Tobias, O.K.
AH: Channing Tobias was the kind of person whose broad knowledge,
courage, integrity made him always in demand. So I wouldn't be a bit surprised, I just don't recall it at this moment. They asked all of these people and none of 'em would run. So finally they called my district leader.
ED: Who was. . . ?
AH: Hulan Jack.
ED: Oh, Hulan Jack, right.
AH: And asked him to run. He was my district leader and I had been able to get him a couple of very important federal appointments for people in his district. I knew the district quite well. My delegation had seen him and asked him about the possibility of supporting me, and he said, "Oh, you couldn't expect a woman for that job!" And none of us had any idea that he had the job in mind himself. But later he was requested to run, and he did. In the meantime, Wagner's campaign people asked me to support Wagner in the campaign, and with the help of a great many women in Harlem we developed an important relationship to Wagner's campaign. I pulled off a party at the Biltmore music room--the Biltmore music room was very important at that time, it was kind of "special" and I had all the dignitaries present.
ED: The place.
AH: It is the place, including all of our Harlem dignitaries first, of course, and then Governor '[W. Averell] Harriman was there, and Mrs. Roosevelt co-sponsored the meeting. This meant that considerable extra attention was given to the Harlem campaign as well as the city-wide one because I had always worked city-wide. We raised a great deal of money, it seemed like a great deal to us, but by current campaign standards it was simply a very small amount of money. But it was the first time that directly we had put money into the political campaign in that fashion, right in the campaign headquarters. And the campaign--and we campaigned all over town, it﻿Page 143
was lots of fun and I enjoyed it. When the campaign was over there were all sorts of stories in the press, to the effect that I was going to be made Commissioner of Welfare. Now a favorite trick in politics is to let the press know that something is planned, and then wait for the criticisms, and then you don't have to make the appointment.
ED: Kind of a feeler they send out.
AH: Yes, for their protection, for their sake, not for yours. So I knew this, and was very annoyed by it, and I decided to make an appointment with Carmine DeSapio who was the political leader, and ask him what the score was. And I did. I started off by saying, "Carmine, were you pleased with the role I played in the Wagner campaign?" "Yes, yes indeed," and he was quite eloquent about it. See, other appointments were being made all over the place. I said, "Well I don't like having my name mentioned as xpossible Commissioner of Welfare' when no one has even talked with me about any kind of opportunity in the administration. It just doesn't make sense." And he looked at me, he said, "Well I didn't realize that."
ED: He said what?
AH: "I didn't realize that was happening." Well now...
ED: You know who did.
AH: As if I couldn't guess that it was. So we talked a bit and he said, "I think that you ought to talk to the mayor." And I said, "Fine, I'd be glad to." So I went to talk to Mayor Wagner. He expressed appreciation for the role I had played in the campaign for the quality of people I had brought into it, and for the speeches I'd made, etc., and then said, "I'd like to have you a part of my administration." And I said, "Well, I'd like to be a part of it." He said, "What--would you be interested in being the secretary of the Board of Estimate?" Ruth Whitehead Whaley was the secretary of the Board of Estimate and I knew that I was not going to accept any appointment which would displace her. I didn't say that, however, my political experience in Washington had taught me a great deal. I said, "You know, Mr. Mayor, you really need to appoint me to some post not currently held by a Negro, because that will indicate your own interest, and your own allegiance." He said, "Well, tell me what would you like to do?" I said, "Well, now, Mr. Mayor you asked me, and I tell you quite honestly, that I'd like to be one of your assistants here at City Hall."
ED: Not defining the duties at this time.
AH: No, not yet. You always take it step by step. Well he sort of
gulped, you know, and he said, "Oh..." Then he said, "Well now let me think about that, and be back in touch with you Wednesday." This was on a Monday. I said, "Fine." Now I said, "Mr. Mayor, will you please tell your secretary that I am calling so that I can be sure she will put me through?" He said, "Yes!" Again, you know, a secretary can stop anything that seems useful to her boss. I don't blame the secretary a bit, but I want to be sure of my entree. On Wednesday morning, I received a phone call from the commissioner of﻿Page 144
police of the city of New York, asking me for an appointment--an appointment for the following Sunday. I went down for that appointment.
ED: Not an unusual day, a Sunday?
AH: Rather, and so I took my husband for protection, went down for the appointment. And he said to me that he'd been talking with the mayor and the mayor felt that I would make a helpful assistant in the police department. You see, that was the job held by another Negro. And I said, "Well I'll tell you, I have really no basic interest in police work, I have to be honest with you. I don't think I'd be an asset for that reason. But more than that, the mayor needs to protect himself, and if I was appointed to the job currently held by a Negro, I would be presumed to be against him and certainly could not be helpful to the mayor. So I couldn't possibly accept. I wish you'd explain that to the mayor." He said, "Yes, I'll explain it to the mayor." It was Commissioner Frank Adams. He said, "I will explain that to the mayor." So I went home just utterly miserable. I didn't tell you, I think, that on the day I was sworn in I was given the lowest salary on the mayor's select list.
ED: Well you're a little ahead of yourself, because we didn't know that you were appointed.
AH: Yeah, we've gotten--that's why I moved back to say...
ED: So that he did finally select you...
AH: Yeah, well I was appointed as one of the appointees, but my exact duties were not defined...
ED: Oh, I see, we hadn't made that clear.
AH: And that's why I have to make that clear at this point.
ED: He did accept you as an assistant but he hasn't said in what capacity.
AH: As an appointee, but no real capacity.
ED: I see. So the day that you were sworn in...
AH: I was very miserable; gradually sworn in but also uncertain as to what was to happen to me.
ED: And what about salary?
AH: On the Friday night before the swearing in, I was called by Carmine DeSapio and asked to be at City Hall to be sworn in. I went in misery, because I just didn't know what was going to happen. And then followed all of the little interviews, you see, and finally, on the day that was to be my first day I went directly to City Hall, and five or six important citizens went with me. I wish I could find that picture and actually give you the specific names, but they were all women of signficance, and the mayor knew it. And they came﻿Page 145
with me, and others sent flowers so that the mayor knew that the citizens expected me, if he wasn't quite sure where I was going to be.
ED: Good ploy.
AH: And I was not assigned. There was a desk in the front hall', and I decided to take the desk, pending assignment. And the mayor was just too busy to see me, which is routine by the way...
ED: An assistant to the mayor with no definition.
AH: That's right. And the Washington--I had had enough Washington
experience to know the whole political play, you see, so I sat at this desk in the front hall, and the staff people who were already appointed and in position who had known me so well during campaign were making circles around me; they hardly knew I was there. Finally I got a little break. Henry Epstein was the deputy mayor, and I had known Henry Epstein for years, and his wife Ethel had been a good friend. We had worked in the Department of Welfare together, and so he came by the desk, took one look at me and said, "You don't look very happy." I said, "No, I've never been so miserable in my life." He said, "Come on, let's have lunch."
ED: What was his position in the mayor's...?
AH: Deputy mayor. So I went out to lunch with Henry Epstein and told him flatly what had happened and that it was outrageous. So he said, "Let me see what I can do." And then he gave me, got me an office, an office in the basement. And you know what basement means to Negroes, you see.
ED: Of course.
AH: Now it happens that I was lucky, for the administrator for his
office was also in the basement. And of course I took my guests on tour and explained the setup of the basement floor without ever saying anything else.
ED: Like they do the White House floor.
AH: That's right, but Jimmy Booker picked it up and put it in his column.
ED: In the Amsterdam News.
AH: In the Amsterdam News. And he was writing then that political
column, you know, and he just dropped a word about the fact that I was located in the basement. This was good. The next day the deputy mayor called me in and said--oh, then they had a meeting of the mayor's cabinet, and I was not invited to that first meeting. I was coming out of my elevator when I was handed a statement in The New York Times which gave the list of the people who had been invited to that cabinet meeting. So, luckily for me, I clipped it and took it with me. And when I got down there, Henry Epstein invited me in, and said that he heard that I had announced that I was not part of the cabinet at City Hall, and that I ought not to﻿Page 146
talk to my community about such matters. So I knew he'd had words with the mayor, you see. So I said, "Henry, let me explain to you that I am a significant person in my community, and that everybody is watching this job. Therefore, they know before I do that you had a cabinet meeting and that I was not there." So I was invited to the next cabinet meeting and sat in the cabinet once a week for the rest of the years. You see, this is the continuation to the kind of thing through which you have to live.
ED: And also that you were the right woman at the right place because your courage...
AH: My experience first, to back up courage.
ED: Yes, because some people without experience would have flaunted it or done the inappropriate thing immediately.
AH: That's right. And be perfectly justified, but it would not have
been expedient. Oh, one other thing--oh, all of the business of the swearing-in ceremony was on television and everybody was really thrilled about it. However, my salary was lowest of any of the thirty-one appointees. And when I reached Harlem, I went by the YMCA, your father's old bailiwick and ran into the cleaning woman, who stopped me and said, "Congratulations. You looked beautiful on the television, and I'm so proud of you. But," she said, "you don't get enough money."
ED: 'Cause the salaries had been printed.
AH: The salary was $8000. "You don't get enough money," she said, "I
make almost that much cleaning, and I know your background." Well, that's where...
ED:	Black and female.
AH:	Yep, that's where it was. Female, and black: female is worse. All of us.
ED:	Female and black, sexism/racism.
AH:	Oh yes, you just weren't expected any place in those days.
ED:	I think Shirley Chisholm said that.
AH:	She did.
ED:	In the Congress.
AH:	I was very...
ED:	It was harder to be a woman than to be Negro.
AH:	And a lot of people don't agree, but I agree with her completely.
ED:	Yes, I've heard that* before too.
AH:	I agree about two things. You know, she ran for the Presidency?﻿Page 147
ED: Yes.
AH: And I'd always planned to do it, she spoiled my best story, I used to always tell young audiences...
ED: I remember you saying that..
AH: This was part of my plan. And the youngsters, thrilled with it.
One father in Washington called me and said, "What are you doing to my son? He says I have to vote for you for president." But, it gave me an opportunity, you see, to have them laugh or be surprised and then to say, "I have the qualifications. I have more qualifications than several presidents you've had. And that..."
ED: Make your point.
AH: Yes, and then add that it's important to be ready, even if you
didn't get the appointment, because I used to do all that kind of thing to help young people find their way. Well, the job was very exciting because the cabinet meetings reviewed the problems of the city of New York. Luther Gulick was a member of the cabinet and a very thoughtful administrator, and really helped set the stage for what could have been an exciting four years. However...
ED: Pardon me, what was his assignment?
AH: He was administration. You look at administration generally to make recommendations, and the whole cabinet was powerful. So I enjoyed that, I learned about the city, and nobody knows the city better than Robert F. Wagner, there's no question about that. The four years were exciting, as I've said. I spoke, for instance, for the banking women of the city, and they too were having problems, and they were so pleased to have me, a woman, at City Hall. And to have me say in front of a couple of bank presidents that women, even in banking, were likely to get a job, which was important, but not the same title or money that a man would get for the same job.
ED: Oh, you were so ahead of your time. Still are.
AH: And they were very pleased with that. Millicent Tritchner, I don't know whether you ever knew her or not, was the president, and that group was really---
ED: She was the president of what?
AH: Of the banking women of the city of New York.
ED: Was she the one who became the president of the first women's bank that was established?
AH: No.
ED: It was Millicent something-else.
AH: I think so, I'm pretty sure she was not. I spoke for conventions in and out of the city. Negroes sent for me around the country as kind﻿Page 148
of Exhibit A. And usually it was possible to go in between, for so many of our affairs are on Sunday. And so I could go out on Friday night and be back Monday morning at my desk. I did a considerable amount of that. And then had the opportunity to speak for the Economics Association convention, and to say some of the things there about the economics of the world that I've been saying here. And, the good government group, and so on, it was this kind of professional thing which was helpful. And then I'd meet groups for the mayor, conventions in New York City and do the hostess kind of thing, as well as present a message from the mayor. I got so that I could write the messages without any problem, show them to him, and off I went.
ED: Did you get to know the mayor's two children?
AH: Very well.
ED: And now young Bobby Wagner is our city planner, having run for Borough president too, right? In the last election?
AH: I'm not sure--yes, I guess he did run.
ED:	Yes, he was defeated by Andrew Stein.
AH:	That's right.
ED:	And he's now the Commissioner for Planning.
AH:	Yes.
ED:	And he's doing, I think, a pretty good job. But anyhow--but you got to know him as a child.
AH: Yes, the two boys were around the house all the time. His first wife, Susan Wagner was a very lovely woman, and she had frequent affairs at Gracie Mansion. And whenever women were involved from around the world I was one of the guests, and had great deal of opportunity to talk with people of stature.
ED: And Susan Wagner also was very open to African American women too, wasn't she?
AH: She was a gracious woman open to life. Not nearly as well used as she should have been. She had a great deal of ability, as I remember going with her to a meeting in Queens where she was speaking (very often we teamed up with her a bit, through her public relations person, who was excellent). And I said to her on the way home, after she had made a little tiny speech which could have been richer, and I knew it could because I knew both her family background and her personal background, and I said, "Susan Wagner, you really ought to spend just a little time and become a good speaker because you have all of the reason to do it." And she said, "Oh, Wag would have a fit."
ED: Interesting sidelight.﻿Page 149
AH: A little sidelight on where he really stood in terms of women. And of course...
ED: What was her maiden name? We'd like to know it.
AH: What's the boy's name? One of the boy's has her...
ED: Her maiden name was his first name? One is Robert. I think it's a name we know, her maiden name, somebody that...
AH: Um-hum. I know it, but it just doesn't come at this moment.
ED: Too bad she had to die so... tragically.
AH: Yes, tragically. In the meeting—the boys as I say were around, growing up. Duncan...
ED: That was her maiden name!
AH: Susan Duncan, right. Duncan was into everything. He was the most aggressive and annoying individual. They'd bring him to City Hall and the guards would watch him every minute, because you just didn't know what he was going to do next. I've never seen him as an adult, I don't know.
ED: You don't hear much about him.
AH: He went to a private school, and...
ED: They both did.
AH: ...when he was attacked by some of the students about something, he told them they'd better be careful, he was the mayor's son. And the mayor went up to straighten him out. Everybody knows that had no meaning in that school situation. But that--you know--you knew them going and coming. And as I say, they were youngsters. But in the whole city picture, I opened libraries for the mayor, health centers, even a bank if you please, cutting ribbons, you know, and making pronouncements and all of that.
ED:	These must have been very interesting years, weren't they?
AH:	Very.
ED:	The fifties. Fifty-three, fifty-four...
AH:	Fifty-four to...
ED:	To '58.
AH:	...wait a minute.
ED:	No?
AH:	Yes.
ED:	You mean '54 to '58.﻿Page 150
AH: Yes, yes. Very interesting years; I met everybody, worked with all kinds of people.
ED: And were you living at the Theresa this whole entire time?
AH: Yes.
ED: And Merritt was concertizing.
AH: Yes, and doing a considerable amount of radio, and always helping me because I needed so much encouragement, and I'd come and pour it all out.
ED: Great support.
AH: Yes, and advice. 'Cause you know there is, whether women like to admit it or not, there is an experience that men have had, that women do not fully appreciate.
ED: I think this is very interesting because it is an example of what
we're finding is possible now, and here back in the fifties you were showing that the woman could be the public citizen. And, with the support and encouragement of the right husband it can be a very beautiful, creative and productive relationship. And this is very true now with your women congresspersons, and so forth.
AH: And she can encourage him and help him understand what she's living through, because remember both men and women have come up in a male-dominated society and in a male-dominated world. So that there is a great deal for a man to learn about that sort of thing, and for a woman to learn because she has not always comprehended his work enough to know that there are mutual strengths which can be useful. And this is, I think, the very important...
ED: I think this is wonderful that this has taken place in the fifties
so that it becomes almost an example to the young women who now--you know--you hear it in discussions, you hear it even in ads on television, where the woman--I think one of the latest is the woman comes home and she's just been named vice-president of her company and it's presented in such a way that you're not expecting her to say this, you're expecting that he's been made the vice-president. So right away he moves into the role of being the supporter of this woman who's just attained this position.
AH: And it can be just the reverse; he can be so annoyed.
ED:. Well this is the usual, this is the expected. But here's a
beautiful example of what can be a very creative experience for both. If he knows who he is and she knows who he is, don't you think that's the key?
AH: Yes. Now..
ED: I have a husband who does not like public life, and he...
AH: I have too.﻿Page 151
ED: He's happy that I do.
AH: I happen to...
ED: Now we're on the other side of this tape and we were speaking about the fact that--you were saying your husband also does not like public life.
AH: Yes, I think that's because he is a solo performer, you see, and does not have to deal with people and processes and movings and change at the kind of level that public figures do. And perhaps it may be also a bit of the kind of thing that Melvyn Douglas talked about--Melvyn Douglas the actor?
ED: Right.
AH: He came out to Howard to talk to a group of students one day, and
one of their questions at the question period was, "How do you like being Helen Gahagan Douglas's husband?" And he said, "Well you know, I'm also Melvyn Douglas. I very much enjoy being her husband. But I am also Melvyn Douglas." And then, he added that there was the combination of mutual interest and respect, and that he operated more in a solo fashion, and he didn't have to be bothered with all of the ramifications of public life, and he was speaking of--particularly of political public life where you're in demand twenty-four hours a day really, and you are part of meetings and conferences and all of the rest of it to an endless degree. And your time never seems to be your own.
ED: Also, you know, Melvyn Douglas and Merritt Hedgeman are both artists.
AH: That's right.
ED: And one day our daughter Peggy was pointing out to me that despite the fact that Don is an executive with urban affairs--with Metropolitan Life--he's basically an artist, because in his shop, making that furniture, is where he really lives.
AH: Well, Merritt is an artist, and he's an artist of living too. And doesn't like life to be cluttered up with all sorts of phone calls, telegrams, travel...
ED: You know what Don calls it? As a matter of fact, just yesterday Don said to me, "I hate hassles." And, you know, hassles don't bother me. I can handle five things at one time on the telephone, but Don says, "What really throws me is hassles."
AH: And also, people in public life spend so much of their own personal time carrying out details of various sorts.
ED: And if you like it, it's fine. I love it.
AH: This week, I've been dealing with Plato and his attitudes about
women for a friend of mine, and with a program for the hearings for the International Year of the Child, telephone calls, discussions of﻿Page 152
all of it. And I think we're not always, as women, as careful to explain what we're doing, on the one hand, and on the other, to time it a bit so that the husband, once he does understand, doesn't have to be always involved in the minute details.
ED: The answering of the phone, taking of the messages.
AH: That's right.
ED: It must be a little hard when both are the same. I imagine they sort of get in each other's way.
AH: Yes, both doing exactly the same kind of, and also, there's no competition. There's no way I can compete with Merritt and his voice. As I can't sing a note. I used to disappoint more white people when I went to speak for their meetings, they usually made it a point to have a musician when I was coming as a speaker. And when they'd come to the door, they'd look at me: "Are you the singer!?" And I'd say, "No, I can't even carry a tune." And then the answer would be, "You can't carry a tune?" with a little shock, "I thought all (gulp) people could sing." And what she'd wanted to say was, "I thought all Negroes could sing." Well I couldn't even carry a tune so I was no competition whatsoever. And in addition, loved music, so that that was a great help.
ED: I never thought I'd run into someone else with that same kind of experience. When I went to school in Maine, and I was the only Negro girl in the school until Dorothy Reeves came there in my junior year. All over the state of Maine when I would speak at various places, they always would say, "I imagine you have--you sing well," or something, and I would say, "I can't carry a tune." And that was absolutely inconceivable to them, that a Negro woman...
AH: Well, you see, the overimage. Our images have always been distorted images. We're all to do this, or we're all to do that, or we're all to be something else, and it just doesn't work that way.
ED: All men, black men, run fast. We're all runners, we're all athletes.
AH: At least they are sports people.
ED: Yes. Of course, they must be interested in sports.
AH: And the rhythm has been stolen and messed up so they're all jigglers as well, you know, it's just unbelievable.
ED: Well, on the other side of the tape, yes, we were discussing this role of the public woman being married to the artist husband, and what a happy combination it can be. And we want to talk now...
AH: I'm still at City Hall.
ED: You' re still at—that's right—and you were telling me, while we
were changing the tapes, about your concern about the waste of human talent.﻿Page 153
AH: And the belief that the community itself has the answers and needed to organize itself.
ED: I want you to make that sentence, your concern about the waste of human talent in city government, how much impressed you were by that. How serious it is.
AH: Are we on?
ED: Yes.
AH: I found City Hall an exciting and stimulating place. I had two very attractive secretaries who really supported me in every possible way.
ED: Are they names we would know?
AH: No, you wouldn't know them. It happens that both were Italian, Catholic, and very experienced in city government. Constance Tomalio, T-O-M-A-L-I-O, and Ann...
ED: Perhaps it'll come to you later.
AH: What was her maiden name?
ED: Ann Hackett?
AH: No. Maiden name...
ED: Well, we may get back to it.
AH: Her married name is Ann Hackett, but she worked with me under her maiden name, and she had had remarkable experience. She'd been a court reporter and could take dictation around one hundred and twenty words a minute. She was so fast that I could permit her to take liberties with her time because she'd do three times as much work as any one else in a given period. Constance Tomalio was a steady, thoughtful, kind with great skill, and both of them made the office a joy. But were they fearful when I came! More fearful of the woman end of it; they'd never had a woman boss. And woman bosses are notorious for being problems to other women. I've never been sure of all of the reasons for that, but one I think is that the secretaries are very important to the men. And the woman coming in has to struggle to make herself important. And therefore may not play up her secretaries the way a man will in order to have his office function smoothly. Well I'd had a lot of experience with secretaries by this time, and it was possible to work out beautiful arrangements with both of them. In fact when I left City Hall, to their great dismay, they gave me a beautiful bracelet with the symbol of the city, you know, the Indian symbol of the city, in gold. And I put it on a bracelet I had which had been given me by the parents of the City of New York. So it represented a lot more than even they realized.
But as I say, the waste of talent generally in the city was a disturbing thing to me. And I believed that it might be possible to organize women's groups and political groups to really think about﻿Page 154
city government and what it could mean. I had helped organize workshops among political women in the city, because I knew that they had to have a bigger role than they'd ever had. And it was kind of the effort to try to use all of this experience in larger--a larger and more important community segment—which was what I considered Harlem to be.
ED: AH:
About that time I met Mr. Fuller of the Fuller Cosmetics Company of Chicago, he was a millionaire, and he had just organized a city-wide cosmetic set-up, a sales force and trainers and all of the paraphernalia that goes with the salesmanship effort in a city, and had bought The New York Age.
Oh, I see.
So he invited me to be public relations consultant for the Fuller Products Company, and as I've said it was a cosmetics company. And...
ED: And you had now left City Hall, at the close of Mayor Wagner's...
AH: And associate editor of The New York Age. And with that offer I decided to go back and resign from City Hall, to everyone's astonishment. You don't resign from a significant political spot.
MH: Anna Paris.
AH: Ann Paris, Anna Paris Hackett.
ED: Thank you.
AH: Thanks, darling.
ED: Thanking Merritt. So you resigned.
AH: So I resigned.
ED: Much to everyone's surprise.
AH: Real surprise, yes. Because...
ED: How long had you worked at City Hall?
AH: It was very interesting, because there had been a rumor just before my second reappointment--my second term ('58)--there'd been a rumor that I was going to be dismissed. Mr. Jack was not happy with me. Now it was a rumor, but in politics you pay attention to all rumors. I would not have thought about it a second time, because I knew my resources pretty well, but the Baptist ministers in New York heard the rumor, and they proceeded to contact the mayor, because they weren't going to have even a rumor of that sort around. And so I got a small raise instead of a firing. And shortly after--which might have come, I don't know. The raise was inadequate, and I decided that really and truly I needed to move, and was grateful for the two offers which came. And so I decided...﻿Page 155
ED: So he offered you public relations for Fuller Products Company and associate editor of The New York Age, which he owned.
MH: And the salary was much more.
ED: And a considerable increase in salary.
AH: Considerable increase in salary. Yes. Yes, business people are likely to be more thoughtful about this. In fact it was 20,000, wasn't it? Twenty thousand dollars, which was...
ED: From 8,000 . . .
AH: From my raise, you see, was a thousand; so from 9,000 to 20,000 was quite a jump.
MH: When you first heard about it, it was one of your own folks.
AH: Oh yes, it was an African American, of course, and I was very thrilled with that because it had meaning across the city.
ED: Of course. So you became public relations director for them.
AH: Yes, and the--Mr. Fuller was an exciting personality.
ED: What's his full name?
AH: His full name, I think, was it--no, no.
ED: Well I think history will know his name because, as the owner of the Fuller Products. If we think of it we'll insert it. TS.B. Fuller]
AH: We all called him Mr. Fuller, regularly. We'd--I'd never thought much of his name and I should know it. But anyway, he was an interesting person who had very little education.
ED: Self-made man.
AH: Yes, in the good old Horatio Alger style. Third grade, I think. But, an astute business mind and a real concern for employment problems among Negroes. He had a sales force, and a sales manager. And the first time he came to speak to the sales group he had, he said with his slight lisp, "I've come to see to it that you stop being poor."
ED: What a great introduction.
AH: Isn't it beautiful? "And I challenge you this morning to take a
look at your Bible, and if you find in that Bible anywhere where it says "Go Thou and be poor' here's a hundred dollars you can have." He put the hundred dollars on the table. Well the sales force, of course, was fascinating. And then he went on to describe to them the possibilities of money which they could make in the cosmetics business.
ED: Certainly borne out today, isn't it, with the five or six black companies that we have now.﻿Page 156
AH: And he was the--really the originator of that idea. He had a large plant in Chicago and branches around the country. And the first convention held in Chicago was really fascinating. I went, of course.
ED: But you were headquartered in New York.
AH: I'm headquartered in New York. I went to Chicago to the convention and listened to the reports from around the country and came back determined that New York City would be the outstanding spot in the country.
The convention had present the key figures in Chicago, city politicians and all the rest, and a display of talent: good music--no junk, you know, really good music. And I'm not talking about opera, I'm just talking about people who knew how to use their voices and bring out tone and make a meeting real and vital. So I was really thrilled.
In the meantime, the associate editorship of The New York Age was very important to me because Thomas...
ED: Frederick...
AH: Frederick...
ED: Fred R.
AH: Fred R. Moore, Fred R. Moore whom I knew well and had respected so much had been our first city councilman before we had--first alderman before we had councilmen in the city of New York--had been a part of the community, he was a top Republican. And in those days--you were maybe not old enough to remember--all of us were Democratic--oh, Republican!
ED: This was before Roosevelt.
AH: Before Roosevelt, and all of us were Republican, and so he was both the hero of the politics and the editor of the paper, and an outstanding citizen. Everybody knew Fred R. Moore. In the meantime...
ED: I remember the switch to the Democratic party allegiance--
membership, because Don's father had a great--my husband's father had a great deal of difficulty, you know, as many black people did, many Negroes in those days, to switch from being a Republican: how could you desert the party of Lincoln? And of course, you know, the boys were in college at that time and they were trying to show their father that he must vote for Roosevelt, and so forth, so I remember that.
AH: Oh, my father was very dismayed when I voted for Mr. Roosevelt
because, he said that "When you vote for the Democratic party you put the solid South in power."
ED: That's right. Oh, how many times...﻿Page 157
AH: And this was the worry. And of course the Republican party had been the liberal party, and had supported the Populist movement in the South when the Democratic party did not. And of course also Lincoln was overplayed in terms of his role in the slavery era. Well all of this was in the package. Also [T.] Thomas Fortune, you see, had been a very prominent part of The Age, and W.E.B. DuBois and James Weldon Johnson...
ED: Had all been associated with The Age.
AH: All been associated with The New York Age, which was the newspaper, and a national paper of great significance.
ED: Did I tell you that Fred R. Moore is our grandchildren's other grandfather?
AH: Is that right?
ED: Yes.
AH: Well that's great.
ED: Marion, his son--his daughter, Marion Moore Day is the mother of our daughter's first husband--Noel Day.
AH: Noel Day, oh yes, I do know him.
ED: So I had these two grandfathers, one grandfather was the editor of The Age and of course uncle Monroe Trotter was the editor of The Guardian.
AH: Oh, my husband knew Monroe Trotter.
ED: Did you, Merritt?
MH: Yeah. I was in Boston and he was studying...
AH: He was studying with Hubbard in Boston.
ED: Oh yes. Those were his later days because he died in 1934.
MH: Well, I knew it was a little after I left there. I used to always see him bare headed and out in the cold.
ED: That's right, that's why he died. With those papers under his arms.
AH: That's right.
ED: He caught bad colds going around the city of Boston with the Boston Guardian under his arm.
AH: Well, having those distinguished people as a part of The Age was
very exciting for me, and so I worked very hard to present community in new ways, and also to do some of the interracial kind of things which are so important. For instance, remember the teacher who﻿Page 158
was--the white teacher--whose sources of information were being questioned and who stood up adamantly and was prepared to go to jail? I went down to interview her and did a story on her. I tried to make it always the stories that were of significance.
ED: Now as associate editor, what was your specific assignment?
AH: I never take specific assignments.
ED: You are always going to be free to be a generalist.
AH: I was a columnist, writer...
ED: For The New York Age, "One...
AH: "One Woman's Opinion." You'd be interested, Alfred Duckett was the editor. You know Alfred cannot write. And Alfred Duckett wanted me to do the column, and I wanted to do it, I was very excited about doing it. And he said: "Why don't we call it xOne Woman's Opinion'?"
ED: And that certainly fits you Ann!
AH: And I really, I had such a good time because I did a variety of
stories. I did one on Fred Moore, and I've forgotten what it was about now, it was a political thing. No, it was not Fred Moore, it was the man who followed him.
ED: William Kelley?
AH: Harold Burton.
ED: Harold Burton.
AH: Harold Burton, the Republican leader.
ED: Did you know William Kelley, interviewer for the Amsterdam News--oh--we spoke about that on one of the tapes.
AH: On one of the tapes we talked about him a bit.
ED: One other question I have to ask you, when you were speaking just now... Oh, did I ask you once before if you have obtained, or do you own copies of all of your columns, so if they could be bound or something like that.
MH: You don't have all of them, but you have quite a few.
AH: I have quite a few, yes.
ED: You have copies of--your own copies.
MH: Some of them are original letters from the newspaper, then the others are typed.
ED: Typed, oh yes.﻿Page 159
MH: Duplicates.
ED: Be wonderful to have them all put together...
AH: Merritt has been trying to get me to do that for ages, but I've got so many things to put together that it's just awful.
ED: You have to live another twenty, thirty, forty years at least.
AH: I'm planning to.
ED: Good.
AH: In fact, I have decided that I want to live to be 12 0, to see
whether we can in this country produce some people who have sense enough to know that they have the world in their hands. And that people of the world have things to say to them that can put more in their hands, and that with the technical skill they have, we can really develop Wendell Willkie's one-world concept. I want to see some of that.
ED: I hope you do.
AH: And so I'm planning to live to be 120 at this point. Now I may increase the number as time goes by.
ED: That's right. With the scientific help that you're getting, you know, on prolongation of life.
AH: Well, there isn't much help there yet. But we've been studying nutrition...
ED: Oh yes! Well, that's some of the scientific help too.
AH: Not really. Not--the scientists have not yet begun the job on nutrition that they must do.
ED: That they must do. Well the doctors are getting no training in nutrition in the medical schools, which is the saddest thing...
AH: That's right. Half of it's beginning. Just the bare minimum, but it's terrible to know that we have had these glorious machines and have not really helped them be the healthy advocate of life that they ought to be, you know?
ED: I know that you and Merritt are very nutrition conscious now. Have you always been?
AH: No, we'll talk about that later, because now we're at...
ED: Where are we?
AH: We have too many interests in common.
ED: That's right. You know what we didn't do before we left City Hall, I think it was during your period there--we didn't speak of the fact that Hubert Delany was not reappointed.﻿Page 160
AH:	Didn't I mention him?
ED:	Yes--No, we did that off tape.
AH:	Oh, I thought we had it on.
ED:	No, we didn't.
AH: I'm sorry. I think that Delany was part of the waste of talent that I'm talking about. Here you'd had experience over an extended period...
ED: As a judge in the Family Court.
AH: As a judge in Family Court. And very much respected, and I'm sure loved, because there was always a warm human quality about any Delany. If you knew his sister, Bessie, who was a dentist here in Harlem. We used to tease her about being the local social worker, because she actually did as much care of human beings from her dental chair as many social workers do from their official offices. She was a remarkable person.
ED: Bessie Delany.
AH: Yes, Bessie Delany, dentist.
MH: You used to send back write-ups on the Mid-East trip every week for the Sunday Amsterdam News.
AH: Oh yes. We haven't talked about the mid-East trip.
ED: But we haven't gotten to that yet. We're back with Hubert Delany and Wagner's failure to reappoint him.
AH: Yes. That was a great disappointment to all of us. And it seems that Wagner had said to Delany that he was going to reappoint him.
ED: Going to reappoint him and Justine Wise Polier.
AH: Yes. In the meantime, one of the very prominent religious leaders of this town sent for me and asked me for my estimate of Hubert Delany. And I told him quite frankly that I was glad that the mayor was going to reappoint him, and he was an excellent human being, and been on the bench long enough to be very valuable. And he said, "Well, the mayor doesn't want to reappoint him, and I'm trying to find out whether I should support him for reappointment. He has helped me with my building and tax problems." I sat there so angry that I didn't know what to do. And I said, "Well I don't know anything about ,your tax problems," it happened to be a very wealthy church, Protestant by the way. I say that because Catholics are always accused of doing this sort of thing, this was a Protestant church. So I explained my hope that he would assist Hubert Delany in being appointed--reappointed. He was not. But Justine Wise Polier was. And I used to say to the community this is the difference between organized power and unorganized power. Well anyway, Justine Polier, who has always been a great human being, at﻿Page 161
her own swearing in said that she regretted that her friend Hubert Delany was not being reappointed, and with her. And that took courage.
ED: That's right. And he appreciated it, I'd heard him, his...
AH: Yes, she certainly did it. I was there.
ED: Well they were dear friends.
AH: And Justine, of course, was the distinguished daughter of Rabbi
Stephen Wise who was always on the firing line with integrity. So it was quite a great moment.
ED: Well, now, we'll get back to Mr. Fuller. But we did want to get that in. So. Working as the editor, did you travel during this period?
AH: Not much, because I needed to do the column every week, and do other stories. I did one on the family; we had family week, and advertised it as such. And a number of families made application to be presented, and we gave awards for families with obvious good relationships and progressive children, and all that sort of thing. So it too was a very exciting time. And then I would report on politics, on religion, on whatever was hot.
ED: Well Merritt spoke of your sending reports back from the Middle East, was that...?
AH: That year, the year I left City Hall, I went to Japan.
ED: I see. For Mr. Fuller.
AH: As Mr. Fuller, really. I said to Mr. Fuller that I had this
appointment to visit Japan and I would like him to begin my formal work right after that trip.
ED: Under what auspices did you have to...?
AH: United Seamen's Service. I am one of the few women experts on the Merchant Marine of the world.
ED: Did you know that Don [Donald Dammond] was in the Merchant Marines in the war?
AH:	No!
ED:	Yes.
AH:	I'll have to talk to him.
ED:	Instead of the Army or the Navy he chose the Merchant Marines.
AH: Well, I had--when I was in India, I had met an American woman--white woman--whose name I have forgotten, and she said to me, "I want you on the board of the United Seamen's Service." Well I'd never heard of the organization. She explained that they had centers all over﻿Page 162
the world and that the headquarters was in New York City, and they had no African American on the board. Well, I thought that was an exciting idea but I explained to her that I knew nothing about it. She said, "Don't worry about that. You have other things that they need." When I came back, before I left City Hall, I had a phone call from James Hicks, who was the executive director, saying that this woman had recommended me and he wanted very much to talk with me. He said, "You know, I feel sort of obligated because she died a month ago." And so he came to talk with me at City Hall, and I became a board member. It's a very distinguished board always, with an admiral or a former top official of some part of the service.
ED: You're still on it?
AH: Yes.
ED: You're still on the board.
AH: Still on all these years. And when--oh I--before I went to Japan, before '58, in '56, they asked me to speak at an international conference in Munich, Germany. And, about that time, I did a speech for Merriam Jackson, a Jewish woman who lived in Scarsdale or White Plains, somewhere in that direction, she asked me to speak on one of the hottest nights there ever was. And I agreed to do it. And when I came back, the next morning I guess after that, she called me to know whether I would be willing to go to the Middle East and Israel. There was a committee called the American Committee--the American Christian Committee on Palestine, it was called at that time. And I told her I couldn't afford to go, I'd love to. She said, "Well, if we get the money, will you go?" So I've always used my vacations, except for the India trip, for these trips because I couldn't afford to just take time off, and I had no extra money to spend that way. And so I said I'd be delighted to go, and do you know the same year, '56, the United Seaman's Conference at Munich practically merged timewise with the Middle East trip.
ED: O.K., so you decided to combine the two assignments?
AH: Yes, yes. Well, to use my vacation to cover the two assignments says it more accurately.
ED: Right. Munich and the Middle East. And...?
AH: Also, that assignment then not only took me to the conference which was discussing the problems of seamen across the world--and I thoroughly appreciated that--and also to the Middle East. We traveled to--first Rome, and then through Turkey, and into Cyprus (wrassling with the word) to Cyprus, on our way to Beirut, Jordan, the whole Middle East area, into Syria, Jerusalem, Israel.
Israel was in the beginning. And I was very glad to have that experience because I had worked a bit in support of the Israel group in Washington which was trying to establish an embassy for Israel. And going back just a little, I had a double interest because you recall that Haile Selassie had watched the development of Hitler and Mussolini, and knew the threat to him and to Europe, and went to the League of Nations to request help in 1935. And was rejected.﻿Page 163
Nobody paid any attention to him. And I had begun then to watch the situation in Germany. And as I told you before, attendance at the international conference of students at Mount Holyoke had given me another glimpse of that problem. So I was particularly pleased to have an opportunity to see the Middle East as it was then.
ED: Was this when you sent the reports back to the Age?
AH: No, I sent them back to the Amsterdam News. They had requested them.
ED: From the Middle East.
AH: From the Middle East. And I sent back reports on all of the trips I made for quite some time.
ED: Did you do more traveling while you were--before you became associate editor of the Age?
AH: No. Just one more trip, which was the Japan one I mentioned.
ED: Oh yes. But you haven't told us about the Japan trip. Pushing you too much, huh?
AH: No, no. It's keeping the chronology that I've been concerned about because it makes it difficult for the people. The Israel/Jerusalem trip was very exciting to me. I had kept up with it, as I said, through the Jewish movement in Washington and through two friends of mine. One who had worked on Fair Employment Practices, and the other one part of the Jewish leadership to help the Haganah, which was the terrorist group out of Israel attempting to get Jews out of Europe and into Israel. So I had a personal relationship to it, and then as I said, the man at the international conference at Mount Holyoke had talked about the rise of the Nazi in Germany, and Fritz Beck, one of the members of the conference, had died in the first blood purge. So it was all very vivid to me and very important. And seeing Jerusalem was important.
ED: Now, chronologically speaking, when you came back from the Middle East and Germany...
AH: Well before I come back I must tell you several things. The Jordan is a tiny river, and not big at all as I wanted it to be. And the Dead Sea is more beautiful than anything dead has a right to be. Looks like a great blue mirror as you ride down the hill toward it. And it's brackish and salt water, and you put a bit of it on your tongue and you feel it for a very long time. And they're selling soda on the stand, and somehow you didn't want it there, you didn't want anything there, but it made me whine for a sacrament, you know? Nothing else did you want there. And we had a glimpse of Jerusalem, which I've always lamented that it is not an international religious city. For so many kinds of religions had been there. African, of course, and that is not yet recognized in the world, really. African, various varieties of the Muslim group, and of many others. Orthodox, Greek, all have had little bits and pieces of Jerusalem, and if it could just have been pulled together as an international city it would have been very helpful.﻿Page 164
ED: Explain the African part for us.
AH: Oh, now that would take another three tapes. You see, Egypt is
Af rica. That whole part of the world is Africa. And we have some African historians who indicate that much of the High God, they called him, relationship to religion, grew in that area also before the so-called Protestant and Catholic and all of that. For Africa is conceived by many scientists as the originator of religion, and the Garden of Eden is said to have been in Africa. And as we watched the movies these days, the pictures of the animals across Africa, you sort of had a feeling that it might really be true. But anyway, that religious study is now being made, and several Africans are pulling together what they claim to be the basic story there. I have not finished it, but I am going to in that hundred and twenty years we've been talking about, because I think it has seeds of significance for this time.
I took the path that Jesus is purported to have taken on Palm Sunday, I've been from Dan to Beersheba, and looked at the mountains, the Moab Mountains, and this lovely lavender color, and was disappointed as I've said in the Jordan. It was just too small, too narrow a stream, to suit my imagination, you know? Israel--we had to go at that time through the Mandelbaum Gate into Israel, you couldn't go directly because of the confusion. And Israel itself was composed of many areas representing really people from some twenty-odd nations who had come for refuge, and immediately in my mind I was identified with the Haganah and the rescue of these people. And we had an opportunity to see the kibbutz, which is a kind of communal setup, as you know, and you see the youngsters there being given care while the mothers work at whatever was useful for the country. We met with Ben-Gurion.
ED: How many in your party when you say "we"?
AH: About twenty.
ED: I see. Similar to the India trip.
AH: Yes, except that I was a separate representative in the India trip, and here I was really a part of the delegation. I had the three months responsibility in the Indian situation, and the people who went with me were more or less on the same plane, but themselves on individual treks of various kinds, although we met together for orientation. But mine was more solo. But in the Middle East we were together, and I always smile at that because when we stayed at hotels, we teamed up for the expense reasons. And we had one young woman in the party who was accustomed not to wear apparel when she was in her room. And one of the more prejudiced members of the group made it a point to stay with me. For once, color was better than nakedness! [laughter]
We had also a journalist who was extremely thoughtful about every little detail. And rather, I guess I would say now "modern" in speech, if you know what I'm saying, and we were coming from Haifa to Rome, and she leaned back and said--I'm sitting with the most conservative woman in the group, by chance--she [the journalist]﻿Page 165
leaned back and said, "Well ladies, we are entering Rome. Get ready to have your fanny pinched!" And this woman said, "Oh--if you're not slipping, you will get your fanny pinched--and this woman said, "Well, I've been to Rome many times, and I've never had my fanny pinched, as you put it." And she said, "All you're doing is confessing that you've already slipped!" [laughter]
ED: Ah! A nice funny memory.
AH: Yeah, very funny. But Israel was exciting. They were again
beginning to build the language, for the Hebrew did not contain the modern words that we've come to use. And some of their scholars were busy rebuilding then. They were building villages, and some of them living on the Gaza Strip prepared to meet assaults when they came.
ED: All significant as you view today's news.
AH: Yes. And I was excited about it because of the refugee situation. And there were some African Americans there, only they weren't African Americans, they were from Yemen. And dark. One little girl, Rebecca, was just like any little brown doll in our communities. I took a picture of her and it didn't come out, and I was always heartbroken about it.
ED: Your memory is amazing.
AH: Her name was called, they called her Rifka, which in our language, is Rebecca. And here is this little segregated colony again, but all of the colonies were by the places from whence they came so you hoped that would be it.
ED: Rather than by color.
AH: And yet later it was proved that there was considerable color
diff iculty in Israel. We went also to Haifa and talked with the mayor, and I mentioned Ben-Gurion. Looking at the country and the size of it, and the rest of the territory around it, for it's a country essentially of nomads, you see, I asked Ben-Gurion whether they planned to expand. And with a twinkle in his eye he said, "Not yet." I talked later with Golda Meir. We had coffee with her, some of us, two or three of us, in her living room, and she gave us American coffee--which was very well received at that point, we were tired of every other coffee that we'd been given--and talked with us about mistakes they'd made. She was really quite the stateswoman. And I have a notion many things would have been different had they kept her in power. But I am sure, given the breadth of her imagination, she probably had to go. At that time Histadrut was really in power--that was the labor forces--and again I had worked with labor and so I was excited about that, and realized that their strength would mean problems for other kinds of groups, because that always is true with the labor force.
I came back determined to keep watch over the Middle East and India, a rather large order, but by this time I'd made a few friends in each of these places, and one of the friends I made in India, for﻿Page 166
example, is now a professor of political science at McGill in Canada. So you never know, you know, and two others...
ED: And you have kept in touch.
AH: Yes.
ED: And you have kept watch.
AH: Yes. In fact I've had a network of people all around this country and, pretty much, around the world, who periodically bring me up to date, or to whom I can ask of them, I can ask opinions, since I know them well enough to know that I'm not getting what usually is handed any foreigner. That's something you always have to watch for.
ED: So that makes your travels somewhat unique.
AH: So that was '56. And I looked over Munich, which had been
devastated by the war, and where they were refurbishing it. And stayed in the hotel where again water was important, it cost you $2 a night to get a bath. And aware again of all of the creature comforts we have and don't really appreciate or share adequately, perhaps. And then back to City Hall, then, you see, '56, I did not leave City Hall till '58.
ED: So you were able to take--you took these travels on your City Hall vacation.
AH: Yes, on my vacation. Any vacation I had...
ED: So back to City Hall. And this is when you met Mr. Fuller?
AH: Then it was in '58.
ED: Oh, so you went to Japan before...
AH: In '58 I met Mr. Fuller, but I went to Japan before I went to work for Mr. Fuller, that's the chronology.
ED: Oh. Now, how did you--what was the origin of the invitation to go to Japan, or the decision?
AH: To participate in the United Seamen's Service International Conference.
ED: Oh again it was the Seamen's Service.
AH: Yes, in both instances we were concerned with reciprocity for seamen of the world.
ED: Now had you left City Hall when you went to Japan?
AH: Yes.
ED: You had resigned.
AH: Yes.﻿Page 167
ED: You went to Japan, and then when you came back...
AH: Came back to Fuller.
ED: I see. But you talked to Mr. Fuller before you went to Japan and said, "I have another plan."
AH: That's right.
ED: Right, right. When I was hired to work at Altman's I said to them I couldn't take the job, and so the woman said to me, "Why?" and she looked at me, and she said, "You have something you're not telling me." And I said "Well I have a trip planned to go to California and therefore I'm really not eligible." She said, "We could have--you can come work for us when you return." It had never occurred to me to believe that someone would hold a job.
AH: Yes, especially in those times.
ED: Right.
AH: So then to Japan, and that was really an exciting experience because I had gone from New York to San Francisco planning to go by ship all the way to Japan. In San Francisco--and by way of Hawaii--in San Francisco--the ship had difficulty with the rudder, and had to return to San Francisco after it had started for Hawaii.
ED: With you on it?
AH: Yes. So, I had to call New York to find out whether I would have time to get to Tokyo for the conference, delayed five--a couple of days--by this misadventure. And they said, "Oh, go by plane from Hawaii." So that was just perfect for my purposes.
ED: So did you go by boat to Hawaii?
AH: I went by ship—oh--that to me was very important. I had never been anyplace on a ship. When I got to Los Angeles, Max Miller--I say this now because he called me yesterday out of the plear blue--Max Miller who lived in California, took me to lunch at Malibu Beach--and I'm on my way to this trip--and said to me at the close of the luncheon, "May I say something to you?" And I said "Sure," and I couldn't think what could be coming. He said, "Please don't ever say "boat', it's a ship." [laughter]
ED: Oh! I'm so glad to know this.
AH: I didn't know it.
ED: Is Max Miller a name that I should know?
AH: Not particularly. He was with me in the Civilian Defense Program and thence, whenever I was ever in any purposeful project, he was always on hand, he's...
ED: The way you said it I thought...﻿Page 168
AH: ...a young, Jewish man from Boston.
ED: Yes, I thought you were referring to someone...
AH: No. The reason I referred to him by name was that he called
yesterday and I hadn't heard from him for fifteen years, and he had talked to me and to Merritt, whom he had known also. Well, anyway..
ED: So you went by boat...
AH: I went by ship...
ED: No! "Don't say boat." That's right. You went by ship. I didn't learn my lesson. You went by ship to Hawaii.
AH: It was the Woodrow Wilson, it was the President Line. And the
chairman of United Seamen's Service sent me roses for my cabin and it was all very lovely. I arrived in Hawaii where they met us and gave us orchids, everybody got an orchid. On the ship was a young Hawaiian girl as attractive as she could be, she had been living and studying in New England, and she said to me that she wasn't sure she wanted to go home. And I looked at her and said, "You don't want to go home?" She said, "No. I don't know what you Americans have done to Hawaii. And I hate to see it." And when I got there I knew what she meant.
ED: Yes, you saw all of that commercialization.
AH: So then I--oh, you know what else happened then. In Honolulu, where we landed, lived Shelton Hale Bishop. It was Thanksgiving Day, and I risked calling him anyway, and he came at once, took me to see his lovely little house and said, "Hawaii is the kind of place, a kind of opportunity anyone should have at the end of a long period of service to life," and showed me the town and told me stories of it, and introduced me to significant people. It was just a wonderful day, day and a half altogether, of reminiscences, because of his role here in the United States. And I came back and did a column about him. For The New York Age.
ED: Oh, that's one you were trying to think of.
AH: Yes.
ED: Interesting that you should mention that, just yesterday Don said to me, "I wonder why Shelton Bishop went to Hawaii?" Just yesterday, like you and Max Miller just yesterday.
AH: Uh-huh. It's a beautiful country, without question, and it's the kind of place that tourists like, but it's also a place where you could make a home very comfortable.
ED: And he was happy there.
AH: And he was prominent there.
ED: Didn't he take a church there?﻿Page 169
AH: Not that I know of, but he could have, because I didn't follow him up.
ED: I thought I heard that after he'd been there awhile he took an assignment at a parish.
AH: He could have.
ED: A small parish, I believe, I'll have to ask his daughter Betsy.
AH: He could have, I just don't recall that. But he had a new washing machine and he was very thrilled about it, and a new refrigerator, and was caring for himself very well and was really quite happy. And I was glad to see that. Then, I had arranged by this time for plane accomodations to Tokyo, and that was a real thrill. I was asked to serve as a moderator for a session of the International Conference of Social Work at Tokyo, Japan, and went there in '58.
ED: As you were asked because of your membership on the board...
AH: Yes.
ED: Of the Seamen's.
AH: Yes. I took the plane from Hawaii to Tokyo, and I mention this
specifically because of the courtesy that the Eastern people always have, and Japan certainly has. We were served American food first, and then the most beautiful Japanese food, and I was just as sorry as I could be because by that time I had no space left in my tummy for that beautiful good Japanese food. We got into Tokyo, went to our hotels. I stayed at the Kokusai Konko which was beautifully operated. The waitresses excited me immediately, because you would look at your service and see that you needed a spoon and before you ■ could say a word, the waitress was there with it--that kind of, almost too meticulous sometimes, service. And out in front were women shining shoes, for three cents a shine. So you again had this realization of the diffences in money. And the young woman, who was my translator in the International Conference of Social Work, was Japanese, and working for an American firm. And she received more money from her work with that firm than her brother, an engineer, did for his work in Japan. So you had again the development of these disparities, which can be so serious.
The first thing that strikes you in Japan is that they all are busy. They work at life, and you know it. Their subway is exquisite. It's immaculate and noise-proof, you just don't hear the sound of the wheels as they roll along. Well, I think they're speedy.
ED: I think they told us the wheels are all rubber.
AH: I'm not at all sure what they are, but I can tell you that they move you along with great comfort.
I went to see the Great Buddha, and stood in its shadow, and understood why it was important, it is massive, and gives that impression which one so sorely needs in a conflicting world. And I﻿Page 170
told you the women were doing shoeshines for three cents a day? And I saw early women who were in the rice fields, and this was a whole new area of my interest and concern.
ED: And a necessity for politeness because they're operating in such a small space.
AH: Yes, that may be part of the reason. I also discovered that they
had the best beer in the world, and the best beef. For they use the beer to massage the beef, and it comes out tender. Isn't that interesting?
ED: It is.
AH: South America also has good beef. There are many events of
importance there. The emperor and the empress came to our opening session, of course, just as the president and his wife might here, and greeted us very formally. Everyone enjoyed that little bit of aristocracy in Japan. And you caught a sense of the traditionalism in many ways. And we went to see--went to one of the nightclubs once, and the geisha girls were there. And' I talked with one of them and she was telling me that she had to buy her own costume--she was exquisitely dressed--and that the tips were sometimes good, and that they weren't always. But no other women, you see, were expected, so I was often the only woman at very many occasions in Japan, for the wife--the first wife--didn't, in that period, come out to public affairs. And our American women didn't realize how important this was, and they were sometimes on Saturday night as part of the army they served there, in the lobbies of hotels, out on the town, in a community which would consider them not quite nice women, under those circumstances.
ED: Did you have the experience that we had of attending the Kabuki theatre?
AH: No. We didn't go to the theatre. We simply didn't have time.
ED: How many days was the conference?
AH: Ah...five, six--probably eight days. See I had to visit one of our centers at a neighboring city, and then do the conference, and do whatever I could in between, and go shopping a bit--not to buy anything really, because I was too poor for that--but to look at the street, at their Broadway, and the beautiful symbols which make it look so glamorous.
ED: Did--something I wanted to ask you about the conference scope--I've forgotten.
AH: And of course, the contact of a good many people who brought vividly the memories of Hiroshima and all that it had meant, that we had bombed them, and that we became the first nation to bomb.
ED: Did you go to Kyoto?
AH: Yes. We did all the routine things, and then all of the other things that we could. Some of the restaurants were interesting﻿Page 171
because the cook would prepare your food in front of you, you've had that experience?
ED: Yes.
AH: That was kind of exciting. The emphasis on fish was interesting,
because fish has been really the basic food of the world, and we are beginning in the United States to discover that it is probably the most nutritious food, especially the lowly sardine.
ED: Which we are trying to get your husband to have a sandwich right now.
AH: Well that one doesn't have sardines because I figured I would not be able to live with him today if I brought sardines out for him. I didn't make it sardines for that reason. But it has been--they have less of the pollution, you see, and therefore are very important. And it's my hope that this will aid me in that 120-age bit that I'm after.
ED: Having learned that with the value of the nutrition of fish.
AH: Yes.
ED: So early.
AH: Yes. Of sardines. Which I don't like, incidentally. ED: Oh?
AH: Oh no. But that's alright, if they'll give the 120 years, I'm determined to eat 'em.
ED: Are you going to last with Ann to 120 years, Merritt?
MH: Oh no, I'11 be in the hole before that.
AH: I doubt that, I think he's going to last too, because we're on the same diet.
ED: Now when you came back from Japan, if we will, or do you want to say more? You...
AH: There's plenty to say but, you know, you can go on forever.
ED: I know.
AH: To make me come back and write a story, about Tokyo, as	a city of ravishing beauty, and about the fact that Japan was the country to
watch in the Far East. And I've enjoyed that because I	was
sensitive enough to see it and to say it, before it was	being said here or before it was a reality here. So I...
ED: A sense of satisfaction.
AH: Yes, yes, that I was perceptive enough. You see, this is the thing that I...﻿Page 172
ED: Well, you are throughout, this is the thing that's amazing me in these interviews, in this interview, is your remarkable perceptiveness.
AH: This is what I have worked for, because if you try to search for
truth you have to... To repeat: if you accept the responsibility of the search for truth, you have no choice but to watch all details and try to relate them intelligently, as intelligently as you can.
ED: So you learn to be perceptive.
AH: Yes. You learn it. Nobody gives it to you, and it's hard work.
Because you always have in the background your own experience, your own limitations, and your own lack of broadly based information.
ED: Ann, you credited your father a few sentences back.
AH: Yes. My father always said, "Search for truth." And I had no idea what an arduous task it was. And Thomas Percival Beyer, my beloved English teacher, said the same thing. And I'm very proud of the fact that most of the members of my family have been searchers for truth, even though they wouldn't admit it. [laughter] And my husband is too, he doesn't always admit it, but he does present me with a kernel of truth when I least expect it. And that has been very helpful. And his father was the same way. His father said to me one day as I left the apartment, "I'm proud that you carry my name." And when I resigned from City Hall, he said, "You had no business there anyway." That's all, you know.
ED: What was Merritt's father's full name?
AH: John M., John Merritt Hedgeman, Merritt is named for him.
ED: And his mother's full name? Oh, you gave us her name...
AH: His mother's name--Amy Hedgeman.
ED: At the YWCA you gave us her name.
AH: That's right.
ED: Ann, in addition to what your father gave you, you're also very fortunate, you and members of your family, with this God-given intelligence. That, because you can have this desire, I believe, to search for truth, but you have also this astuteness which enables you to.
AH: That you learn too. A good mind, though, is important. And I have thanked God every day for the fact that I have a good mind, and have prayed that I use it wisely.
ED: Well, you are.
AH: Because my--my trip to the Middle East taught me a great deal about Jesus of Nazareth, and about the meaning of religion, and I have a notion that most of us have not understood that Jesus was probably﻿Page 173
saying two things: "There is a God, and you are the son of God, and as there is divine in him, there is divine in you." The problem is to use that divinity toward a realization of the fact that the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. We beg for the things that we have.
ED: Well, Mr. Fuller had you when you came back, right?
AH: Yes.
ED: And you have promised to come work for him.
AH: I met with the sales force, and I told you...
ED: Right, right. Oh, and we even--that's right, and as associate editor of The New York Age. We had gone back to pick up the Japanese trip. And, you then moved on when you left the Age to become the...
AH:	I finished a book before I left the Age.
ED:	Oh yes,: this first book, written under. . .
AH:	Written anonymously.
ED:	Anonymously.
AH:	It was called All Shook Up.
ED:	And what name did you use, what pen name? Oh, no name.
AH: No, I did not use my name, it was as told to Archibald Ray.
Archibald Ray was an older man in this town, sort of like the boys of yesteryear kind of group, but an articulate political analyst. And he and William Stringfellow were interested in my writing this story of some political activity which was going on.
ED: Which, if you had, you didn't want to use your own name.
AH: I didn't dare use my own name at that time. And I think I'm going to work out some way to put it into condition to be reprinted.
ED: Under your own name.
AH: Yes. Archibald Ray is dead, and I'm sorry I didn't get to talk with him about it, but that's just one of life's problems. I had an interesting experience with it. I went to a Protestant breakfast at one of the large hotels downtown, I think it was the old Astor, and I was to bring greetings. The guest speaker was Nelson Rockefeller, and they placed him to my right. And we talked a bit, and he was working on a whole group of figures, and I looked at them and surmised that he was reporting on the whole defense posture which we were then assuming. And I said to him, "I've just finished reading the Rockefeller Brothers Fund reports. And I want to ask you a question. Why do you think the report begins with defense and the discussion of defense, when its excellent second portion is on education, and we need to think about education?" Well he looked at﻿Page 174
me in a little surprise, and said, "Well, you know, everybody is defense-minded these days." And so I said, "Well if Rockefeller can't get away with putting education first I guess nobody can." And that was our introduction. I was called on to bring greetings before he did his main speech. And in my greetings I said, "You as welfare workers in the city of New York are the most significant people in the city, for you are closest to broad human need. And you have learned that man does not need or basically want bombs, missiles and bases. He basically wants the opportunity to do, to be, and to become." And sat down. The social workers tore up the place with applause, of course, because it was a tribute to them. And Nelson did his speech without one mention of defense.
ED: Oh Ann! Ann, what a stroke of genius!
AH: What made me think of it at this moment is...
ED: Gives me goose pimples!
AH: I had just finished All Shook Up, and I made an appointment and read it to him.
ED: Read him the whole book?
AH: Yes. He was very excited about it because he was always interested in politics, and we were quite good friends. When I worked in District 9 in the Bronx, well I'd better do that later, but anyway we'll pick up now...
ED: This is interesting because again it shows what a warm human being he was.
AH: He was, definitely was.
ED: He really was. Despite how one might feel about him politically,
financially, and so forth, when he died I thought that Kissinger, in his eulogy, he really--well, I did, you know, I'm not fond of Kissinger--but I thought that he showed the great humanity of this man. Did you, did you hear that speech? If not, read it, Ann. Even if you don't like Kissinger or Rockefeller.
AH: I don.'t know. I like Rockefeller. I--you'll love this--I've always been sorry for two people in this country: Averell Harriman and Nelson Rockefeller. And when I first thought of it,, I was out at the Harriman estate, this simply--you've been there--simply gorgeous place, and on the wall is a picture of Harriman. And I said to myself how horrible it must have been to be submerged by all of this. Because he looked like a nice young defenseless boy in that picture. And I always had the same feeling about Nelson.
ED: Too bad he had to have all that.
AH: Yes, and if he had not had all that wealth...
ED: But I think you can save the humanity of the man despite being a tycoon.﻿Page 175
AH: No, I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about the man himself;
in his own opportunity to really release himself, and the fact that he wouldn't have had to be defeated on stupid grounds rather than on grounds of whether or not he could do this or that job. That's an awful load to carry.
ED: Yes. But what I think I'm trying to say is that despite all of
that, somehow, to common people like me--others--that humanity came through.
AH: But you see what I'm saying...
ED: Despite what he's surrounded by and what he had to become.
AH: What I'm saying to you is that he could not become his full self.
ED: I agree.
AH: That's all.
ED: I understand what you mean. But you would think that a person who was surrounded by all that he was and who became the political aspirant, became the richest man, that you would never even glimpse that little bit.
AH: No, no. They always had their retainers.
ED: Now explain that. Go ahead.
AH: It was a pattern, they had their retainers. And what you do is to look at the people they really retained. Then you begin to understand what they missed.
ED: Who?
AH: Who what?
ED: Who, who for instance, that Rockefeller retained?
AH: You, me, oh... That brings tears. Elmer Carter, Elmer Carter especially.
ED: When he was chairperson of the...
AH: SCAD at one time.
ED: State Commission Against Discrimination.
AH: You see, they can't -move you, they can't meet you peer level, ever, and part of it's your fault, 'cause you can't meet them peer level, and you're conscious of it. And part of it is their unawareness of what it is they lost in between. The same thing was true of Mrs. Roosevelt. It was noblesse oblige, marvelous as she was. But there was no way to overcome that.
ED: She was restrained from that.﻿Page 176
AH: She had to be. When she and Crystal Fauset broke, remember?
ED: Broke?
AH: Yes. They were—Crystal was quite, a protege for a little while.
ED: Until she refused to be any longer, huh?
AH: Until her very natural self asserted itself.
ED: And she couldn't be the protege.
AH: No. And this has been my basic problem. I could have been sitting here rich, but, I had always to be me also. It's fascinating to see the way the thing works. That too has been a waste of talent. Nelson couldn't break through that, primarily, for the presidency. He wanted desperately to be president. When Martin Luther King died, NBC asked me to do a eulogy to him, and I did, and received phone calls from around the country. And some of the people asked, "Is Nelson Rockefeller going to run for the presidency?" That was the time, you know, when he was trying to decide. I wrote him a letter saying that I'd had these inquiries, and I got a note right back thanking me for telling him, (and sent from the Virgin Islands or some place where he had a home), and for the first time used my first name. And I knew, then, how much it really meant, you know.
ED: He was relating as a human being.
AH: That's right. No.
ED: One human to another.
AH: No, no.
ED: Not still, huh?
AH: No, he was relating as a man in need of and wanting the presidency of the United States. I was simply a vehicle which, for a moment, had given him the sensor to--which sounded hopeful, that's all.
ED: Where are we?
AH: I don't know. Where are we? Where are we, Merritt?
ED: We're about to move on to becoming the consultant for the AMA, and you explain the title.
AH:	Oh.
MH:	Used to be in education there?
AH:	Yeah.
ED:	Um-hum. Department of Education.
AH:	The Division of Education, they called it.﻿Page 177
ED: Merritt's memory is as good or better than yours.
AH: Oh, he's got one of the best minds that I've...
MH: Proceed.
AH: Proceed. Change the subject now.
ED: Give us the title.
AH: Oh--no, first, let me say this. In the meantime, the major
salesperson in the Fuller setup was not really aware of how the business could be expanded, but desirous that it be. The Age was trying to be helpful, but all of it together meant was that Mr. Fuller was not here enough to really s ee that it moved the way he really wanted it to, and the persons in charge here didn't have his vision but did pick up his idiosyncrasies, and used them. And so it was a very difficult thing. And about that time I was asked to serve as a consultant for the centennial period of the Negro colleges in the South, which had been established by the Congregational Church through the American Missionary Association a hundred years before. And this American Missionary Association had the funds to handle the development of a centennial program, and so I was asked by the Division of Higher Education to accept responsibility for the development of the centennial period. I immediately--and this, by the way, was the United Church of Christ, which had originally been the Congregational Church and became a merger, calling itself the United Church of Christ, I've forgotten the church which merged with it, for the moment.
ED: Yes, we should know that.
AH: The colleges involved were Talladega, in Alabama, and I thought of course of Buell Gallagher when I got to Talladega, and of Ann and Juliette Derricotte, who had come out of that setting originally. And Fisk University at Nashville, which was Merritt's college, and part of my inheritance in many ways, and of Le Moyne, at New Orleans [n.b. I'm not sure this is where it is...], and I was interested doubly in Le Moyne, because my mother's people came out of New Orleans and this would give me more opportunity to see that city. And [Huston] Tillotson College in Texas. Where else, Merritt? That's six.
ED: How many altogether?
AH: I think seven.
ED: Well.
AH: These colleges were about to be a hundred years old. Now, it also
happened that the Division of Higher Education had white colleges in the North which were also near their centennial. And I conceived the idea of interchange of professorships and students so that the colleges might meet each other, and we would have a normal heritage and a normal integration process. I visited all the colleges, talked with faculties, talked with students, worked on programs for special days they were having, and then planned that we would have a﻿Page 178
special award for students on these campuses who wrote essays about African American history, and especially the history of their colleges.
ED: The colleges in the North were white colleges.
AH: Yes.
ED: But they had had the same assignment?
AH: No. I was giving them a kind of assignment to discover each other.
I knew there was no way to move into the colleges themselves because the academic world is as tightly knit as any other world. And therefore--and the racial thing was there too, of course. And so I hoped that out of their exchanges would come the development of programs which might mean new kinds of expressions of concern with education and with integration.
Warren Marr, who is now the editor of the Crisis magazine for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People...
ED: A former Pittsburgher.
AH: Yes, former Pittsburgher, was one of my assistants. He is a very artistic person, as you know.
ED: Oh, yes.
AH: He writes well, he conceived of the award symbol, which we used, and was very much interested in the whole idea.
ED: He's a fantastic artist.
AH: Yes he is. He's got a whole wealth of abilities which need to be used even more extensively.
ED: Exhibited at the Bedford-Stuyvesant Gallery recently.
AH: Is that right?
ED: His work is amazing.
AH: Well, he and Merritt were, in different periods, president of the Waltann... what was it called, Merritt?
MH: Waltann School of Creative Arts.
AH: Waltann School of...
MH: We were on the advisory board for that.
AH: Waltann School of Creative Arts. They were on the advisory board,
and at one time he was president, and another time Merritt was. And they presented significant artists of all stripes, through the leadership of Ann Pinkston, and this was quite an experience. In fact, the other day, someone called me and said, "My sister in Dayton called and said that Watts would be in her town shortly," and﻿Page 179
I said the cultural association had presented Watts before he was big time, as they say.
ED: Andre Watts.
AH: Yes, Andre Watts. Before he was--I said Professor Watts? Andre Watts, before he was really big time, you know, this was quite an event.
ED: You're with the AMA [American Missionary Association] and the centennial.
AH: Yes, yes. As part of the effort to call the colleges — all of them, Northern white and ours in the South--their attention to an art form that we knew was exquisite and that was old enough and all the rest, we decided that we would bring Roland Hayes to the concerts at Carnegie Hall. He was seventy-five. And this was really a national event. One of our colleges in South Dakota gave him a special honor and he received honors from Italy and from other parts of the country. It was really a tremendous afternoon at Carnegie.
ED: And this was your idea, wasn't it?
AH: Yes.
ED: Beautiful.
AH: You see, I met Roland Hayes through my husband, and I've always loved tenors as I've said before on this tape, so when Merritt mentioned it to me I thought it was a natural, and it was really his suggestion, but I didn't give him any credit for it. And I was so grateful for being able to pull it off. And we arranged for school students to have guest tickets, so we had a large balcony of students.
ED: At Carnegie Hall.
AH: At Carnegie Hall. And Roland Hayes was tremendous that day. He had the same artistry, and I still have the clips which Merritt made into a scrapbook for me. It was a beautiful occasion.
Well, it was that sort of creative experience continually in the... Toward the end of it there was a national conference on religion and race in Chicago. And I went out for that from the church. Because I had the notion that if there was a coming together of religious forces there might be changes that would be important. But when I got there I discovered that it was really the same old story. In many ways. Our great churches were not really there. It was the National Council, all right, and it was Jewish leadership and Catholic leadership, but we were not really there. Benjamin Mays came and made a beautiful speech as he always does, and chaired the conference. But he should have been leading it into a broader concept of church rather than chairing it, if you know what I mean. His speeches were excellent. And Martin Luther King came and made an excellent speech. But again it was an event rather than an emerging thing, and so I issued a statement to the press saying that again we were the porters of the conference and not really having﻿Page 180
our great religious experience properly related to the whole thing. And William Stringfellow spoke and said, "I'm glad for this conference. But it is too little, too late, and too lily-white." And he's white, as you know. And there it was.
Well I came back very much discouraged, and A. Philip Randolph called and asked me to come by his office for a small meeting. And he had...
ED: He had seen the remarks in the press?
AH: No, it had nothing to do with it. And reported on what he saw as the condition of labor in this country. And said that something must be done about it.
ED: Sounds like the present times, doesn't it.
AH: And suggested that we perhaps ought to plan a March on Washington, and this was 1963. And he set up this administrative committee of which I was the only member, woman member, as usual. And so, we talked about our plans. In the meantime, someone reported to Martin that this was about to happen...
ED: To Martin Luther King.
AH: To Martin Luther Ki,ng, and out of Atlanta came the statement that he was planning a March on Washington. Well I took the clip in my hands and went to Randolph and said, "If he has a March and you have, both will be handicapped. This idea has t'o be pulled together." Randolph agreed, and by good fortune Martin was speaking for a labor meeting in town. And I asked Mr. Randolph to go, and we bearded Martin. And it was agreed that it would be Martin's March, Martin Luther King's March, it was to be a March on--March for freedom. And Randolph's a March for jobs. So we had them put them together and A.D. King, Martin Luther King's brother, helped us manipulate the thing so that the two did come together. And that's how we happened to have a March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
ED: Isn't that interesting to be sitting here right inside history, listening to it.
AH: And then, Stringfellow asked me to have luncheon with him, and
Robert W. Spike. I had known Spike casually, not well, when I had worked with the AMA colleges.
ED: Is this Bishop Spike?
AH: No, that was, that was... I know who you mean but it wasn't the
cathedral. No, this is Robert W. Spike, who was an administrative person with the United Church of Christ when I worked with education there. So I knew him quite well from that end of things. He was a very aggressive and dynamic man, and I was--had finished with the centennial situation and was footloose and fancy-free. So he asked me if I would be interested in working with the March, essentially because I was on the administrative committee of Randolph you see, and it would mean that the two things could come together in an interesting fashion. And I accepted, and became the coordinator of﻿Page 181
special events for the March on Washington and the development of the program for the Civil Rights Bill of '64. So that the two were together again.
ED: Now, you, who was your employer?
AH: The National Council of Churches.
ED: I see. So you--and you had the double assignment.
AH: And the National Council of Churches had passed a resolution on June 7th, 1963, calling on the church to make an all-out effort to pass the bill of 1964. And it Was a result of that that the special group was set up as a Commission on Religion and Race with distinguished religions from all over the world on it, from all over the country on it. And with Robert Spike as executive director and Oscar Lee as associate.
ED: And you as coordinator.
AH: And, yes. And then we had other staff. We had a lawyer, we had a cameraman who did some exquisite pictures--young fellow who was deeply interested in the whole thing.
ED: What was the date of the March?
AH: August 28th.
ED: August 28th.
AH: 1963.
ED: Peggy [interviewer's daughter] was married two days later, but she was at the March.
AH: Was she?
ED: Yes.
AH: Isn't that interesting.
ED: Right. Their marriage was, her and Noel's marriage was on the first of September, but despite all the wedding preparations she was determined...
AH:	Had to be there.
ED:	Had to be there.
AH:	August 2 8th, 1963, and what happened the night before?
ED:	The night before the March?
AH:	That's really not fair because...
ED:	I do remember something...﻿Page 182
AH: William E. Burghardt DuBois died in Ghana. ED: Right. August 27th.
AH: And on the 28th, the morning of the 28th, we had a breakfast in
Washington. And Rosa Parks was in the hotel, and we went to get her to bring her to it. She made a speech, she's the gentlest woman you've ever met. Not at all the fire...
ED: Continuing, May 9th, 1979, continuing the taping of Dr. Anna Arnold Hedgeman. To repeat that date, because the tape was a little noisy, this is May 9th, 1979, and Ann Hedgeman and I, again, are in the Schomburg library down in the first floor reading room. The library is closed so they have allowed us to use this space at this time. Ann, on the end of the last tape you spoke of the speech by Rosa Parks at that breakfast, would you repeat that again, I think we lost it.
AH: Yes, as I recall, I did not say that it was a Protestant breakfast. You recall that we had Protestant, Catholic, Jewish religious leaders involved, and we had called this special breakfast early the morning of the March, for Protestant leadership from across the country to meet with us. Dr. Eugene Carson Blake, as chairman of the Commission on Religion and Race, as one of the outstanding religious leaders of this nation, opened the session, and asked a number of people to bring greetings. In the meantime...
ED: What hour of the morning was this?
AH: This was about nine o'clock. In the meantime, I had heard that Mrs. Parks was in the hotel and we went to her room expecting to see her excited, as we were, and she was totally untouched. We explained to her there was this Protestant breakfast and we would especially like to have her join us as we went down to it, and she agreed. And as I said on the tape before, when she was introduced and Carson Blake and Robert Spike--Robert Spike had made a very helpful presentation also. And then turned to me and said, "Would you like to introduce Rosa Parks?" And for me this was one of my highlights of all my living. For here was this lovely, quiet, pleasant, average churchwoman in mood, who stood there and said that she was grateful for the participation of the religious leaders, and hoped very much that we would manage to secure their leadership in a bill for civil rights. And that was it.
ED: That's very interesting that you are setting the story straight for us because, you know, for those people who wish to make ugly remarks, the dissenters and the detractors, I have had people say to me,"I hope you haven't swallowed that Rosa Parks story. She was a person that was put up to it." And I have said, "You couldn't be further from the truth." And of course now this is an authentic reporting and straightening of that story, but that is such an evil thing to say. Here was a woman who was tired on the bus one day. And it was being billed by these enemies as a put-up job.
AH: Yes.﻿Page 183
ED: Unbelievable.
AH: And she was tired not from sewing .all day, but from the agony of the struggle. And I have her on tape. She had--her mother, her parents had been active in the civil rights movement. She and E.D. Nixon, a former Pullman porter who has his own business established now in Montgomery, had been the leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, so that they had been continually struggling for freedom in Montgomery, Alabama, and in Alabama generally.
ED: Well, that is an interesting addition, too, because the lore of the story has come down by those who are not well informed that she was tired...
AH: From sewing.
ED: Well, from sewing, physically tired. Also I've heard it said she was tired everyday of walking that distance from the front to the back of the bus, passing all those seated white men. And that has been said as part of her tired, but you're putting it into...
AH: I wouldn't say "part of the..." unless you say that all of us, "part of the struggle," are tired. Tired of the inane quality of it, tired of the fact that you couldn't get a seat. I'm sure there was much of that in her, but not tired from sewing. That's the only thing I wanted to correct.
ED: Very good.
AH: It is important to note that Martin Luther King was one of the few
United States leaders selected in the community. He did not develop the March. He did not develop the whole idea of the bus effort. It was in the works. Now I'm not guessing about this. I was in Montgomery during the days when Ralph W. Abernathy, from his church, had developed a strong group of people concerned with changing conditions in Montgomery. And as T said, Rosa Parks and E.D. Nixon were the leaders of the current struggle before the bus strike, and during the bus strike. They had made every effort to negotiate. Community would not negotiate. The leadership behind the bus difficulties would not negotiate. Martin Luther King had come to Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, which by the way is just a stone's throw from the old seat of the confederacy, and I've been in the church. He had come there to preach...
ED: His church was in Atlanta, wasn't it?
AH: No. His father was Atlanta. His church was in Montgomery. And he was an excellent speaker. Not extraordinary, because as you know our ministers have always been fantastic speakers. So he was not extraordinary but he was a good speaker. He had a good solid bass. And, the most important thing (and I think Rosa has said this on my tape) was that as she and Nixon talked about the whole effort they decided that he hadn't been in the community long enough to have any enemies, and so they would ask him to mediate. Now I do not want to detract in any way from the fact that once he had seen the whole﻿Page 184
situation and understood it, he accepted continuing support of it and gave leadership to it.
ED: Yes, but it's good to know the origin, to get the story straight.
AH: The origin was from the community itself. And you know this doesn't happen often in communities.
ED: Right. He had the cohesiveness instead of...
AH: Really, he was a very fortunate man. And in the meantime, Abernathy had more of the masses of people with him in his church, as did some other ministers. So Abernathy was a great asset.
ED: Abernathy's church was Dexter.
AH: No.
ED: What is it?
AH: Martin Luther King's church was the aristocratic Dexter.
ED: And Abernathy's church was?
AH: I can't give you the exact name of it, but it was a more-or-less
mass church [First Baptist Church]. Abernathy had a real knack of getting to people.
ED: Which church did Rosa Parks belong to?
AH: I don11 know.
ED: O.K.
AH: It may be in my tape, I'm not sure.
ED: Yep. Well that's alright. Now we have that straight for the
record. Now you, you're going to talk to us a bit about the March and about the civil rights law that was passed as a result of it. Of course...
AH: The day of the March was really amazing because 250,000 people came. I have to comment. There's been a march this week on the nuclear situation, and the press reported 600,000 people attended, and said it was the largest March Washington had seen. Now I'm sure that psychologically they just put aside the march on Washington, you see. Now prior to the March, there had been a continuing attitude of "It's going to be violent." See, no one placed the violence with the white leadership in power, which was the violent leadership which permitted even the law to be violent. Nobody put it there. Even now they talk of that era as an era of violence. But since we were involved they will assume that that violence was "black," so-called, violence, Negro violence as they said in that time. That would be the assumption immediately. But it was not a time of violence within the group, for every bit of their strategy they worked through in terms of the situation as it was. And no one emphasizes the Bull Connors and the wall of hoses of water, and the﻿Page 185
dogs put on human beings who merely wanted a seat in a bus. And by the way, originally, their demands were just that few: a seat in a bus. It was only later that a broader program developed. In fact, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, nationally, said that the program was not adequate for them to support it. And so they got accused, you see, of being against it when that was not the case.
ED: It was too mild, they felt at that time.
AH: It was too mild for that time. So, the day of the March then,
250,000 people... And you will never know the work that had gone into alerting communities across the country on the day of the March that we wanted a community which had church bells ringing for the hours of the March. And others, they did other symbolic things all across the country. And the people at the march reflected the quality of development which had gone in city after city, in town after town, and even across the country in rural areas. Two hundred and fifty thousand people there.
ED: This nuclear march the other day was 600,000?
AH: Six hundred thousand, that was reported.
ED: Yes. Doesn't seem as though it was large from the pictures on T.V., does it?
AH: Well. It doesn't seem that large, but it could be. It's a very large space there, I know it very well.
ED: Now this work in the cities and towns which had gone on...
AH: No.
ED: ...was the result of...
AH: That's later. What we did then was to concentrate on the bill.
Very disappointed that the president didn't come. It was reported by friends that he sat at his television and watched it. And I...
ED: The president at this time was?
AH: John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And we had all hoped that he would come.
Of course he was new, he was young, he was limited in background, as most white American leadership happens to be. In fact, Jackie Robinson talked with him before he was president and talked to him about the Negro situation in this country. And he said, "Well, he just didn't know much about us." And it was very sad to think that a man could run for president who didn't. But then, when I checked back over the presidents who have been in power in these United States, not many of them had the quality of information that they really needed about this country and how it was developed.
And of course this has been true of all of us, my education didn't provide that either, except as my father supplemented my life. But as far as the college itself, I did not get the quality of information that I ought to have had. And by the way, years later,﻿Page 186
I said it, from my college platform when they were offering me an honorary degree. And I didn't know whether they'd want to after that or not, but I had to tell them that as beautiful as the preparation was, it was not adequate in terms of bringing to the attention of students, including me, the major contribution which the Negro had made through all the time. First out of Africa and then here. So I didn't, at that time I was very hurt about it, but later it occurred to me that this was just the result of our total failure to develop an educational program of real substance in this nation.
ED: And I hope you're going to dwell on that a little further down the road when you began teaching at N.Y.U. and the work you've done for supplementing the educational information too. We'll get to that further down.
AH: Yes, I'd like to do that.
ED: Did Hamline ever, incidentally, did it respond in any way to your. . . ?
AH: My favorite professor, Thomas Percival Beyer, whom I've mentioned before, came to me right after the speech and said, "I was sitting there thinking back to the years when you were here, and I failed you because I was a tired liberal at that time." And then he arranged for members of the faculty to sit with me and talk about curriculum. And that was a really rewarding experience. And the following June they gave me the honorary doctorate of humane letters, the first honorary doctorate given a woman graduate of Hamline University, and since I was the first Negro graduate I was doubly pleased that the woman end of it was recognized too.
ED: Yes. Now when you made your remarks it was before, it was just going back to campus to make a speech?
AH: What I think, what really had happened was my class, the class of 1922 had recommended me for honors, and when the authorities received it I think they'd forgotten I ever existed, and so they asked me to come and speak for a convocation.
ED: I see.
AH: And that's when I had to decide, do I butter the boys a bit to
receive the honorary doctorate, would I embarrass my class if I tell the truth? And finally I decided I had- to say it as I saw it.
ED: I think I need to tell you right at this point, although it is a little off, our fellow committee member on this project, and your dear friend and my dear friend Muriel Sutherland Snowden, just two weeks ago, was called back by her alma mater, Radcliffe, and she gave the same type of speech. And she has been out of college now forty years. This will be her fortieth anniversary coming up. And she gave a talk which told exactly what was happening in the Radcliffe world in 1934 to 1938, and how she couldn't live in the dormitory the first year. And the young Radcliffe students just sat there in absolute disbelief, both black and white.﻿Page 187
AH: Of course.
ED: Completely unaware of the education that a black--an African American woman had to endure.
AH: Yes, and on top of that, you see, later they'd meet it all down the road as these same whites move into power, and have no concept of what has happened in the development of the nation.
ED: Well. The March and the passage of the civil rights bill.
AH: Oh. On the day of the March, and a very fascinating thing happened.
ED: And it was a beautiful day. Weren't we fortunate?
AH: It was a beautiful day, and the people assembling, coming in all
sorts of vehicles, cars, and some had come by plane, of course, some by train. Every way possible to get there.
ED: Walking. Those who walked.
AH: Twenty-one young people walked from Brooklyn, New York, to Washington, led by Jean Robinson. And Jean Robinson is the granddaughter of one of the great inspirations of my Brooklyn days, Matchee Marshall, marvelous woman.
ED: Black woman, African American woman.
AH: African American, and as we said then, Negro woman. So I don't want people to be confused. Then, when the March--oh, there are a good many leaders involved. You probably recall, that Whitney Young--I should always start with A. Philip Randolph, who had begun the whole March idea on the basis of the fact that when people have done everything possible, and get no response, they must move. And he could say that with that gorgeous baritone voice of his.
ED: He turned ninety just last week. ■
AH: Yes.
ED: I guess you know that.
AH: Yes, I do. We gave him, in Harlem, his eighty-third birthday party, so we've kind of kept track of his»years since, and we were the first to do it, by the way.
ED: You and Merritt?
AH: No. I led it with a group of community leaders here in Harlem.
Whitney Young--now deceased, died in Africa you will remember--head of the National Urban League, was there. All of the leaders of--there were leaders of labor, of each of the faiths, of all of the kinds of important groups in the country, which was a magnificent situation.
I think I'd like to highlight several things, however. We had difficulty getting a woman on the program. The Negro men are just﻿Page 188
as chauvinistic as white men, because after all they grew up in the same culture, and suffered the same problems. And with the Negro man, he had need for more power than the white man did, and so his was accentuated very often by that fact, so that it was difficult. We were able finally to get them to ask Daisy Bates to do a brief presentation, and remember Daisy Bates was the Little Rock Nine, and you'll remember that struggle. She was allowed only a few minutes, really, because, you know, Roy Wilkins, NAACP had to speak, and the others, Walter Reuther, etc. But we did get her there. And they did, rather casually, introduce Rosa Parks.
And I sat there with tears, I left the platform and sat down at the base of it with Senator Wayne Morse, who had been a strong supporter from the early beginning, and with Father George Ford who'd always been a struggling, facing, reasoning person. And I was proud of the specialty of two speeches, one of them by Rabbi Joachim Prinz, and he said he was the head of the Jewish group in Germany at the time of Hitler, and therefore he understood the quality of struggle. And that, coming from a Jewish leader, who identified himself as that, meant a great deal that-day. And then John Lewis--Young, and we'd fought to get him on the committee and on the platform. John Young said, "We have little to be happy...
ED: John Lewis.
AH: John Lewis, not Young, there was a John Young. John Lewis said, "We have little to be proud of today, for men and women are still laboring in the cottonfields of the South for less money than they ought to have, as we sit here in observance." When we came out of the March--and there are many things that you could tell about it, and I hope a lot of people will begin to tell their stories about it--as we came out June Kushino, K-U-S-H-I-N-O, a member of our Commission on Religion and Race staff said...
ED: You were staff member too.
AH: I was staff.
ED: I think somewhere in the tape I said board.
AH: You said board, but I was staff. A staff member, another staff
member, said to me, "It's been a glorious day, hasn't it?" And, "But," she said, "it's a kind of suspended moment, isn't it?" And so in my book, the Gift of Chaos, I've called the second chapter on the March "A Suspended Moment," because of her words. It was a suspended moment, for the men went to the White House afterwards for a conference with the president, and they didn't even take Rosa Parks, and those of the rest of us who really were responsible for that day, and I was unhappy about Martin's speech, "I have a dream," you remember?
ED: Yes, it's the most quoted speech of the whole March.
AH: Yes, yes, it was. I was very unhappy about it. And I'm glad I put it in my book The Trumpet Sounds, and sent Martin a copy, and he knew what I had said, for how he--and I understood why he did it--he was too young yet, remember he was very young. And he said, "I have﻿Page 189
a dream" and I wanted to scream, "We have a dream." For sitting in front of him were thousands of people who had come there with the same dream. But more than that, back of that 250,000 crowd was the slave. And the slave woman. And the men and women who'd written the great spirituals, the only basic music the United States has developed. All of them were in that moment. And I wish so much that he could have said, "We have a dream." And so I came away from the March in tears.
When we got back, however, the messages poured in, back to New York and the National Council of Churches. The messages poured into my desk: "What do we do next?"; "How do we move?"; "Where is the bill?"; "What is the story?" And this was exactly what we needed. And we got out material right away describing the process of a bill, and I was grateful for my work with Fair Employment Practices legislation so that I knew exactly how to say it so that the people in communities would understand. And we told them of the--where the bill was, and how important it was for them to reach their...
ED: Had the bill already started or it needed work?
AH: The bill had been presented and, as you know, a bill goes through the process of being presented and all that, and then all of the--
ED: That had begun.
AH: Yes.
ED: And then the March, and now the follow-up.
AH: Well, the follow-up was not really of the March but of the spirit of the March, because we were already working on the bill.
ED: That, I think, is important to know.
AH: And Mr. Randolph and his committees had already been at work on the bill. And actually, the church which got much of the acclaim had capitalized on the basic work which had already been done.
ED: I see. And that's why he was calling it a March for Jobs before the combination that you spoke of before.
AH: Yes, and freedom. But, well, no, that was not...
ED: His original March was going to be a March on Washington for Jobs, and then it was combined.
AH: Yes, but, I'm not talking about that, that was a Martin Luther King/Phil Randolph combination that we had to pull together.
ED: Right. No, I know what you're speaking of.
AH: I'm talking about the church and its committee had nothing to do
with the original organization; they simply approved and supported the March. And then, organized their support to lobby for the bill. And we had in Washington groups coming in to lobby for it continually.﻿Page 190
And in February (January, February...)--in March of '64 we had a huge meeting at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., which we called the Church Assembly, and that was interracial, interfaith, government people, key leaders, everybody was there, it was a magnificent evening. With Warner Lawson, the great music leader of Howard University, and his choir, plus other groups, singing some of the great songs of faith. And we had to turn away people from that door. And the following day, when the--this was an interfaith group--the following day, the National Council of Churches Commission on Religion and Race began daily Protestant sessions at one of the great churches in Washington with speakers, and then people coming in from across the country depending on their interest in a particular speaker. And right after that service of worship,, we had moved into a separate chamber where we explained to people how to approach their senators, how to approach their congressmen, we explained that if they were busy to at least sign up on their guest book, and also then to reach out to their legislative representative who would probably be in the office and explain what they were after, and ask if they could have a word with the congressman, and the same with each senator. And then in Washington you can go to the Senate chamber, in the anteroom, and call a Senator off the floor. And we taught them how to do that. And then, they would come back and report to us, so that this process kept up for weeks.
ED: Your organizing days came in great... All the way back to the Brooklyn women, when you organized for jobs.
AH: Brooklyn women for election, Brooklyn women for jobs, and every single...
ED: Jobs in department store.
AH: That's right. The YWCA training out of the standards study that we talked about. Everything that ever happened, Harlem, most of all, gave me experience in organization, and I used every bit of it. And we had a good staff too.. A young lawyer who was watching out for the legal end of it, and for what could and might happen on the floor of the House and Senate, and also keeping track of the legal situation in the South where people were being jailed and jailed and jailed, and bail money was not available. He organized a group of lawyers in New York City and they helped arrange bail money, so that there were many people at work. Robert W. Spike had spent every bit of his time at work on every phase of the program to keep me in touch with leaders and all that before he left. He was still there at the time of the March, and, 'cause he led it. And J. Oscar Lee, who has never had the recognition he ought to have had, who was with George Edmund Haynes in the old Federal Council of Churches, and knew both the church structure and setup, and also knew the country and had worked in many intercultur'al activities, and I've told you about Robert Spike, who was really a tremendously dedicated person.
ED: Oscar Lee, African American, or what?
AH: African American. Brooklyn, New York.﻿Page 191
ED: And Robert Spike, of course, was white.
AH: Robert Spike was white. A theologian in background, has written a number of books, had worked in Harlem with Seymour Hill in his training program for young ministers. And so he had a real sense of the race thing, and what it was all about.
ED: And we're so devoid now, aren't we? 1979, leadership.
AH:	No, no. Remind me to talk about--no, no, we have fantastic leadership.
ED:	O.K., it seems like those days are gone.
AH:	We have a problem, but we have fantastic leadership.
ED:	Not being utilized.
AH:	Oh, yes.
ED:	But all right. You get to the point..
AH:	Let's get to that a little later, I'll use all your time.
ED: Yes, O.K., good. We've got the bill, we're getting the bill ready to be passed. You want to comment some more on the actual passage.
AH: In the meantime, yes, the struggle went on. Letters into
communities, instructions to communities, people working on everybody they could reach. All of the emphasis that we could possibly make on the bill, making it clear that this was nothing revolutionary, that it simply said that a man ought to have an opportunity for work at the best level of his skills: fair employment practices. And you know, it seemed incredible, and in that bill, by the way, was fair employment practices itself. And I remembered that when we had been fighting for fair employment practices, that Mary Norton, I think that I put that in here before, Mary Norton had said, "It took us thirty years to get a bill on child legislation," and do you realize that actually it took us twenty years to get fair employment practices.
ED: Right. Going all the way back to that first start.
AH: All the way back to our first start. And remembering that was a
bitter moment. Why should it take that long to interest the basic law in fair job opportunities?
ED: O.K. What was the essence of the burden of argument of the opposition, besides saying that it was revolutionary?
AH: Oh, that it was revolutionary...
ED: Communist.
AH: ...that law, we didn't get much of the Communist except at the level of the South where there were active Ku Klux Klanners. I have a picture of a little boy who was part of a Klan, it just hurts your﻿Page 192
heart to	see that little child there, all sheeted up and everything.
Well, we	didn't get as much of that in the North, but the law should
not have	to deal with this, people should not be required to accept
anybody.	It's that whole business of the...
ED: Business of the government telling you how to run your business.
AH: And your business indicating that it is free, this older free
enterprise, free enterprise to do what we said, to punish, to fail to recognize talent, to sometimes kill, to abuse... Is this what we stand for? So it was at that level that we had to work all of the time. And you will remember that our men were recently out of the armed services, that they'd been through pure hell in terms of prejudice and discrimination and all of that. So that there was a double need in us to see that this happened, and with whites it was the old, old story.
Now we did get tremendous support, and as you know, one thing that we felt very badly about, was that John Fitzgerald Kennedy didn't come to the March. And he did receive the leaders and talk with them, and finally in June of '65, urged, it's June of sixty--
ED: Four.
AH: Four, urged that the bill be passed. We had other people who were equally difficult. You'll always have problems with the Rules Committee in getting it released and all of that. But with all of the kinds of pressure that came together we finally did secure the bill in '64. It was a great moment, and yet again a frightening one. We had a closing affair to express our appreciation. It was held in front of the old church building near the Capitol. One or two senators came, but it was not the celebration it really ought to have been as near as it was to the Capitol. And as Wayne Morse and I left that session, I said to him, "Do you think we're going to be able to hold together this coalition of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish leadership and religious life towards the implementation of the bill?" And he had helped the fight of the first FEPC bill, and he said, "It's hard to know." And by the way, several members of our FEPC staff were present at the March, and they had followed the bill through. And this was a very strangely disturbing moment. You just didn't know...
ED: What would happen next.
AH: And we came back...
ED: I think you ought to also say that this was the Civil Rights Bill of 1964.
AH: That's what I said.
ED: Yeah. Preceded, all the way back, to 1867, 1887.
AH: I think it was 1887, I have that list at home.
ED: Is it in any of your books? I don't recall. But I think with
students, as we're talking about this bill, you know, let's put it﻿Page 193
in the perspective of it being part of a whole series of civil rights bills...
AH: Of course what you get to--not only that--you get to something else, and that is the necessity...
ED: ...which were not observed.
AH: ...and a necessity to look again at Reconstruction, and that whole period.
ED: If it had only been carried over.
AH: When I talk about future, let me put some of this in there.
ED: Yes, O.K.
AH: Now, when I came, when we came back to New York, we continued our work...
ED: With the council.
AH: Of the council. With the Commission on Religion and Race,
attempting to interpret, wherever it was needed, and discussing, the cities. For most of us had come to realize that the cities of this country needed help. Now that's way back there.
ED: Yes. Back in '65.
AH: They needed help, and that we had now new linkages which might make us useful. We had no money to go in and organize a city, we had no such notion. And we didn't believe in it anyway. We had decided after a very serious conference that what we needed to do was to pick up what was in those communities and help interpret the ways in which they could help the cities face the ways of developing community. In the meantime...
ED: Now you were still with the Council?
AH: I'm still with the Council.
ED: And Dr. Spike has left at this point.
AH: No, he has not left. He--just before--he began talking about cities before he left.
ED: Oh, he did.
AH: And then he was offered an opportunity to teach the whole idea of
social strategy as he had learned it through Seymour Hill in Harlem, and through his intensive experience with the National Council of Churches, with his unusual comprehension of personality relationships and all of that. They'd asked him to teach at the University of Chicago, and we were very happy about that. It did not occur to me that we should have insisted that he be retained until we had finished a program which would ensure the implementation of the '64 bill. It just didn't. I was asked--oh--a﻿Page 194
search was on for a new director. And I had met Benjamin F. Payton, here in Harlem, where he had been working with the Protestant Council of the city of New York, investigating and thinking out programs with various communities, of which Harlem was one. I was very much impressed with him because he was a former Howard University professor who had left Howard...
ED:	Was he an African American?
AH:	African American with theological and sociological
background, Ph.D. in each. Therefore prepared to put together this city package. And he wrote a document called--I guess I should give you a copy of that--which was called "Next Steps in Civil Rights," emphasizing metropolitan, rural development. And when he put out the first copy, Dr. Seymour Melman, M-E-L-M-A-N, of Columbia University, saw it, and contacted him. And they revised their plan a bit, with the two of them doing it together. And this was a great moment, because he had a sense of what it was all about, and this meant that we needed to look for a Catholic, perhaps, who could see the same thing.
ED: Did Mr. Payton, Dr. Payton, replace Dr. Spike?
AH: Dr. Payton, then, Dr. Payton came to--I'm a little ahead of the
story--Dr. Spike left and we were searching for someone, and I met this Dr. Payton as I told you. And when they said they wanted someone, I secured his resume, curriculum vitae, and sent it to them. Now the reason I was especially interested in him was that Daniel Patrick Moynihan had written his book, and I called Payton because I had heard of his background and had seen him listening to people and working with them intelligently, and I called him at the Protestant Council of the city of New York and said, "We need to have reactions to the Moynihan report."
ED: Now, was this the Moynihan report on the status of--where he...
AH: It was on ethnic...
ED: Was this where he made all the fuss about ours being a matriarchal society, black, African American?
AH: That isn't, his focus at that point was on the--he Was trying to call attention to making, really, the problem ours rather than...
ED: The universality of it, right. Putting the burden that it was all of us, Americans, African Americans fault, yes.
AH: Putting the burden pretty much on us.
ED: That was his first report.
AH: That was his first report. I had read his book, and was very disturbed about the superficiality of it, even the Irish he handicapped badly, and I'm part Irish, not in terms of inheritance but in terms of having grown up in an Irish community, as I've said before. So I was angry by the cursory way in which he handled the Irish, and equally so about the cursory way in which he handled the﻿Page 195
Negro. And so I called Dr. Payton and said, "Do you, I am very disturbed about this book, and I wondered what your reaction is?" Well his was worse than mine, his was more intensive than mine, and certainly more scientific. So I got interested, and that's how I happened really to get his resume and give it to the powers-that-be, and they selected him to follow Bob Spike. And it was then that we had this emphasis on the metropolitan rural activity to follow up our organization, which had been for the March, and for the bill primarily. The purpose of the March was really the bill, and that got lost somewhat in the emphasis on the March.
[Tape off/Tape on]
ED: During the era of Dr. Payton as the director we had meanwhile elected a new president, right.
AH: Yes, and also...
ED: Oh, we had not elected a new president, how can I say that? The assassination of Kennedy brought into the presidency...
AH: The assassination brought in... I was standing, I'll never forget it, I was standing in the hall at National Council of Churches when word came that Kennedy had been killed. And we all stood there and cried, it was a sad moment, because this young man had intelligence and had personality, and natural sex appeal. And I believe could have grown. And the reason I believe it so firmly is that Bobby grew, and he certainly was a really arrogant...
ED: And he grew and expanded.
AH: Less well-informed person, and he grew and expanded, so I am sure that Kennedy could have, but he wasn't ready yet.
ED: We all remember where we were at that moment, don't we. It's Don's birthday too, you know, when Kennedy was--a--November 22. We also recall where we were. Now L.B.J. [Lyndon B. Johnson] did something, important.
AH: L.B.J, came into power, and one of the important things he did which got minimized a great deal was to do a radio speech, a televised speech in which'he wound up with "We Shall Overcome," which was of course a theme song, the major one in the minds of people of the movement, of the Southern movement, and spread, of course, to the North. And recently, my same Japanese friend, June Kushino, I told you about, had her first trip to Japan, and she met in a meeting of people who were concerned with some freedoms in Japan, and they closed the meeting with "We Shall Overcome." And she was so thrilled. But anyway, I wish so much that some of the other songs, the great freedom songs they used, could have become a part of our -singing habits in this nation. "Before I be a slave I'll be buried in my grave," "Ain't got time to die," the kinds of--"I'm climbing Jacob's ladder,"--the kinds of things that were in the spirit of the African, and of the African American, in terms of the continuity of heritage.﻿Page 196
Well, we went to work on the cities, and we were called many places to consult. They would give us their plans, and we would make suggestions or comments, or find sometimes other resources; you see, we did not have money. Then, and in the meantime, of course, hoping the communities would utilize the bill for the reasons and purposes it was intended. L.B.J, was interested, he did a speech and called a conference called "To Secure These Rights" in Washington.
ED: At Howard, wasn't it? '
AH: No, it was in Washington, it was at the old, oh, I can't remember the name, the famous old hotel there.
ED: Oh, the Willard or the--I know the other one.
AH: No. The Willard is a small one, this one was--I can see it.
ED: Not Mayflower...
AH: No. Boy that annoys me. Anyway, the--in the meantime, we
discovered that the conference was not put together to talk of, really, about solutions. It was really a--quite a routine conference. And those of us who had various experiences were not so meshed that you really got to the next steps of problems of cities and all that sort of thing. A lot of talk about community organization, but not enough. So finally, several of us worked out a document which we decided to present, which called for the kind of development of cities that we knew was important. We couldn't--there was no place to get it in, there was no discussion permitted at this conference. They had really rigged it for us and, as far as we knew, dear Daniel Patrick Moynihan was in the rigging process too.
ED: Pardon me, what was he then? It wasn't the Senate, where he hadn't been elected. You ran against, you said you ran against Moynihan?
AH: Yes. Before I left...
ED: No, I was just saying tell us about it.
AH: Before I left the National Council of Churches, I was requested by William Fitts Ryan, Congressman, to run on his ticket for, he was running for mayor of the city of New York, and he wanted me to run as president of the City Council. Well this was a natural for me because I had helped revise the charter, and I knew a good deal about the City Council, and of course I'd known the city for all the years. And so I agreed to, once I explained to him that I had no money for such a venture. He asked me again--and I was cleaning my house at eleven o'clock at night. He wanted a real ticket that he could respect. And he had asked a Jewish leader, a philanthropist, a man of considerable concern with all sorts of public issues and a good financier, as controller, and so there we were on this ticket for the city of New York. And the council agreed that I could do it. So I had to campaign all over the city.
Moynihan also was running, and I was rather annoyed by this because he had been in Washington serving in government as a part of--﻿Page 197
advisor--an advisory group. But, when he came to run in New York, he really had no immediate background here, and what he did was to talk about all the greats he had known. And fortunately I had known them all too. And so finally, on a televised program which I hope to get someday, I said after he had said, "I have worked with L.B.J, and John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and Eleanor Roosevelt and Herbert Lehman, and so on," and I said, "Well, you know, I worked with all of those characters too, but I'm not claiming them in this fashion," and then I went on to talk about City Council. Well the payoff came one night when I was called to the Lexington Club--which was then the Democratic Club of New York, really, the aristocratic group--to explain my position, and he was there to explain his. And they were prepared to vote for him, as I had been tipped off, so I made my presentation especially challenging. And they gave me their vote.
ED: Oh, great!
AH: Finally, of course, all of us lost--that often happens with a ticket which is independent--and I often wish that the three of us could have been in this city during this period because, you see, I'd been at City Hall and I knew where the weaknesses were and why they were, and Ryan could meet some of them and he had sense enough to use a variety of people to help him.
ED: Who was elected from that election, what mayor? We're back--well~-we'll think of it and get it in. You'll think of it.
AH: I was so busy concentrating on Moynihan.
ED: On where we were, right. Yes, alright, Moynihan opposed you...
AH: And so then I had a chance, really a good chance, to know my own
strength and to know his superficiality of approach. And so at the White House conference, the same thing was evident, you see. We prepared a position paper, which we passed out in the corridors of the hotel, since they wouldn't let us have discussion in the meetings. And one of the--I suppose now it was FBI--came up and told me I couldn't pass out these materials, and I said, "Under whose authority?" And of course he didn't say anything, and we continued passing out our positions calling for metropolitan/rural development in the nation. We came back very much discouraged because we had had a pre-White House conference, we had set up the things that we wanted to see happen. And this, I think, you will find probably in my book. And therefore, we sort of lost on all grounds.
In the meantime the council itself was changing. Our staff members in the commission gradually found other opportunities. And again, I should have worked out a way of challenging the whole thing. It happened directly when I went to Atlanta to a National Council of Churches conference and found my name on the retirement list. No one had discussed retirement with me. I had gone in under special circumstances. I should, probably, have studied the personnel records and known, and have known that they had an age limit. But I didn't. I looked at that catalog--and I've always been grateful to Oscar Lee, who told me of it--I looked at that program and saw my name listed as retired, and I was never so angry in my life. I﻿Page 198
called two people to come to my hotel room, told them what had happened, and said, "I'm leaving Atlanta." I knew the two people would see to it that it got around sufficiently so that there would be no action in Atlanta even if there was later in New York.
And I came on back, I never will forget it, it was a Friday. Before I got here almost, I had a telegram from the young man who was the director, overall director, of the Department of Social Justice, which is what they had changed, you know, they loved to change from race and religion to social justice; race and religion was a little too hard.
ED: And this was their first act of social injustice.
AH: That's right, exactly. So, I--this man--I came back, and I got a telegram from the Director saying, "Please don't take any steps until I see you." That morning, Saturday morning, he called and we had dinner at Frank's restaurant in Harlem. He was very apologetic, said that just by chance he had signed a whole group of things at one time, and this had come through and "Please, it was just chance." And then he said, "You do have the retirement age." Well now it happened that I knew several people who had been continued as consultants even though their retirement had come through.
ED: And this hadn't even been mentioned to you.
AH: Hadn't even been mentioned. And so I told him that, so he said, "Well I'd like to have you do a legislative job for us in Washington." Now they had a legislative setup in Washington, and a good one. They really did not need me there, but I was listening, and I said, "Fine, when will I know?" "In about six weeks." Well, you see, six weeks would have been the end of my term, and I figured it was just one more white man's trick in giving himself time until he could manage the whole situation. I said, "Alright, I'll be back to you. And did you say six weeks?" And we set the time.
In the meantime they brought in a new director, 'for Dr. Payton had faced the fact that they did not intend to do the job that he had envisioned. It went to the extent even that it was so obvious that he decided he had no place there. And he had accepted a position as president of Benedict College in South Carolina. My six weeks--and so he had gone. I was then asked to carry on the ecumenical program, and this I was excited about because of the varieties of my experience. And I...
ED: Instead of retiring you--but continuing as a consultant.
AH: No, no-no, this was before the retirement thing came through. And during the six weeks...
ED: I see, director of ecumenical programs.
AH: And, Dr. Payton had done that.
ED: I see.﻿Page 199
AH: I think, probably, he was trying to safeguard me if he could, and I was still carrying on commission on the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice functions as well, so I was doing a couple of things. But they brought in a new director of the whole Department of Justice. He was a pleasant man, with theological background, and no basic experience with the politics of the National Council.
Just before the end of my six-weeks period my worst suspicions were verified. Dr.--this man called--this new director called me--and he was Negro by the way--and said "By January first"-~this was 1967--"By January first '67, your retirement is due. And we do not have any other functions which you can fill." So I said directly to him, "Thank you for your statement, but there is no way you can know what functions I might fulfill here because you haven't been here long enough. And I hope you will not do errands for these people. Thank you for the interview." And I left.
I then went straight to the director, the top man, and said, "I believe we have an appointment due. The six weeks is up." "Oh," he said, "yes," getting red. And you know they often blush, it must worry 'em inside. Anyways, he kind of blushed and said, "Oh yes." I said, "Well, the six weeks is up and I thought you'd want to talk.I He said, "You know, I wanted you to do a legislative project on the Congress for me, or for us. But, I wasn't able to get the $5000 necessary." And I said, "I have two comments. Number one, by what stretch of the imagination did you assume that I would be willing to do a vital congressional project for $5000? The second thing I'd like to wonder about is are you telling me that you don't have $5000 worth of experience here? If you don't, you ought to do what we talked about before, go back to school and get ready for a larger opportunity." And I left his desk.
Got back to my office and the staff was so upset--my immediate staff. And we talked about it a bit. And then suddenly they were going to have a party for retirees, and of course I was invited, and I explained that I was not interested in a party, and I was not retiring. I was off payroll, but I was not retiring, then or ever, until I was incapable of functioning.
ED: Wow, that's a beautiful way to put it!
AH: And then I set up, got ready to leave. And it hurt because we could have done so much. My husband and I discussed it at some length, and we decided to establish our consultant service.
ED: What's the name?
AH: My areas, we just called it the Hedgeman Consultant Service. My areas of interest, of course, are education...
ED: Political action?
AH: No, no.
ED: That's not part of it.﻿Page 200
AH: No, it is of course, always, but all--everything's political action, so I don't use it that way. Education...
ED: Religion?
AH: No, education--religion's something else. Education--oh this is ridiculous.
ED: Employment... You called your new service, what was the official title?
AH: The Hedgeman Consultant Service.
ED: Dealing with...?
AH: Education, urban affairs, and African American studies.
ED: And what, for the purposes of those who might want to contact you, is the official address?
AH: 10 West 135th Street, Suite 15P, New York, New York 10037.
(212) 281-3010. Merritt Hedgeman accepted the responsibility for what we called "contact." So at the bottom of our stationery was "Contact Merritt A. Hedgeman," and the address and phone number. Now, education, urban affairs, and African American studies combined all the varieties of experience that I've had. In the meantime, students were demanding African American studies. And I began developing outlines for a course in African American contributions to development, so that it would not be simply our history, but the relationship of our history to the development of this nation. And later I learned, to the development of the Caribbean, of Europe, Canada, and of course the United States. And I completed...
ED: You mean the more you put it together, the larger you realized it was.
AH: Well, I started with West Africa, of course, because most of us, called then "Negro", had come out of West Africa. And so I began there. And it was the first time that I had considered the slave woman and what she brought with her to the United States, and the slave man. And while I was dealing with that, I had the opportunity to go to Africa. This was in 1960, before...
ED: You know, Ann, you haven't done that, so let's skip back to that.
AH: No, put it right here.
ED: Right, yes, right now, 1960 you went to Africa.
AH: Yes, but wait, let me put it here just the same.
ED: Yes, fine, I want you to put it here. Can you tell us about the trip to Africa now?
AH: No, but I want to do it right now. Wait a minute.
ED: In developing the course, the curriculum.﻿Page 201
AH: Yes, we started with that. I have not reported before because I wanted to use it here.
ED: O.K., fine.
AH: I went to Africa in 1960, and that's when I really started looking at the world in a new light. I had seen its poverty and agony in the Middle East and in India. And I had seen a good deal of the problems which had come in Europe. And I knew them because of the immigrants who brought them here and who had left Europe because of the problems, you see, I had all of that. But I didn't have clearly the African story.
And when I reached Ghana for the Conference of African Women and the Women of African Descent, where I was keynote speaker, I met for the first time the basic story of Africa, because the Congo had exploded. And the ships were coming in from the United States, the planes, and the planes were coming in from U.S.S.R., to help in the Congo. Dramatically, then, I began examining Congo as I would never have done if there hadn't been that flare-up and found for the first time in graphic detail, thanks to George Edmund Haynes, and thanks to Mark Twain, and to a committee in England which had been very helpful in trying to straighten out the Congo situation. And I recall that it had been called the Belgian Congo, and before long I was to know that Belgium would not have existed long without Congo. And I discovered also the way in which the Congolese mining had supported much of the world, and the minerals and metals that came out of it, the nuclear background materials which came out of the Congo. None of this had I known, you see. I had been educated in the West. And it wasn't profitable to tell us where they stole their properties, where they stole their basic materials. And I say stole because, in the Congo there is a university which, at the time I was there, had had about twelve African students and the rest white. The miners had had their arms chopped--their hands chopped off for misdemeanors of varying kinds. They had been cheated and robbed in every possible way. And I'm so grateful for finding Mark Twain's story of the Congo, because he was saying it right out loud. And there were English groups saying it too. But, by and large, the Congo was supporting all of us, and also of course many other parts of Africa in many, many ways.
When I returned from Africa, after meeting Africans from twenty sections of the nation, and spending some time at conferences in Nigeria, it seemed very important to follow through by putting together in my outlines the economic meaning of slavery in the West. And I was brought up sharply by the realization that it was England, the machinery which had been set up, England was selling slaves from Africa to the West Indies and to the West. And guess which state in this nation...
ED: We did that before...
AH: We did that before, yes, didn't we. Massachusetts was a leader, and so here--we did it in connection with Mr. Lincoln. Well I put all of that into the material too. Then, as I said before, this meant developing outlines which began with Africa and tried definitely to﻿Page 202
picture their relationship to the world. And I realized that the West Indies, you see, was part of that picture. That South America, Brazil particularly, part of that picture. Certainly England's selling and buying helped her economically, plus the products which were taken in the imports which came through were tremendous.
ED: For clarification, tell us, these outlines that you were developing was of a curriculum to be used in courses...
AH: Yes...courses...
ED: ...on the African American's contribution to the development of the nation. And I had... Where are those outlines right now?
AH: I have them.
ED: How available are they to people?
AH: Not very available because I ought to have money to have them put into good condition for availability. In fact, I'd really love to do a book with them, I think they're worth it. However, those things cost money. And I have--I never had a career, because I never was in a position to make choices of what I would do. I simply used whatever ability I had, at whatever opportunity I found available to me.
ED: Or whoever found you at the time, with these different offerings..
AH: Sometimes that happened, yes.
ED: Well, is there any way--now you say money, of course that's the main ingredient, the main feature for even funding the books that I know you're going to write in the next few years, or immediately. These courses--have you approached the departments of higher learning and the Board of Education of the city of New York with any of these?
AH: No. My experience with the Board of Education made it very clear that in general the approach was perfunctory. You see, what I'm talking about means that history and social science has to be reorganized, and politics even. And it's a very basic thing. In fact I'm getting ready now to approach my own university to see whether I can get them interested in securing funds from some of their related foundations to bring together my material and theirs toward a new kind of history course, a course which ought to include the fantastic amount of materials which are in John Hope Franklin's book From Slavery to Freedom. I tell him I don't like the title because slavery has not been appropriately analyzed in the West, and freedom doesn't exist yet. But, the book is fabulous. It's very well documented. From Slavery to Freedom by John Hope Franklin, I've used as a major text. Of course, Carter G. Woodson's book--books really--are major too, because he was the initiator of the whole idea of the Negro in history in this country, and set up the National Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. Which they have changed to African American, I'm glad to report.
ED: Right. NSLAAH. How about--well how soon are you going to do this. Are you in the process now of contacting Hamline?﻿Page 203
AH: I have not done so.
ED: Time is essential.
AH: I have not done so because I just haven't been able to spend the time with it, partially because of my husband's serious illness. And I have--he has always been my backer in every, almost every breath I've drawn.
ED: You feel it all through this interview.
AH: And has always helped me in every way, so that I want very much to help him regain his health. And he's a very private person. Very few outsiders could really help him for that reason. And a person of great strength, and that strength is dissipated by the illness, and so it's—we've had a really important psychological situation to work out together. So I have not been able to follow through on some of these things. But, the outlines--I have used the outlines in a graduate course, for instance, at New York University in social work.
ED: Yes, the one I monitored partially. Tell us about that course.
What period of your life was that, when you were teaching at N.Y.U.?
AH: Oh, just a couple years ago.
ED: It was about—yes--about three or four years ago.
AH: About four years ago I think.
ED: What was that in connection with--just separate--a separate contract?
AH: No, no, it was--yes it was a separate contract.
ED: What was the course?
AH: It was the African American Studies.
ED: Right.
AH: And the same thing, I did a series of lectures at Columbia in the same--in the same way. And then upstate New York...
ED: Yes, but your outline..
AH: Using the outline..
ED: Is really to--is also to help develop curriculums, isn't it, in various colleges.
AH: I have not done it that way because--I suppose my best story is one of the colleges in the city of New York asked me to serve on a committee to review programs in terms of a ten-year span. I was delighted.﻿Page 204
ED: You were what?
AH: I was delighted because I felt very ready for them. While they were distinguished educators, deans of some of the colleges in the city--and other people of distinction--I found out--I realized later that I'd been asked largely because I was known there, having taught a few courses here and there, but also because I was community in a larger sense. The discussion was very academic. You see, our various college departments are still sealed within each other, and there has been no basic integration of college program. And so you had the various people explaining their thinking and explaining their process, but no real concern about curriculum change. And toward the end of the session I asked whether we would be discussing curriculum change. And they said, "We're not," blandly, really, "we're not ready for that yet."
ED: Oh, God, that was your whole hope in being there, wasn't it?
AH: No.
ED: Oh?
AH: I knew better. No, I have been in so many of the colleges in the
United States that I knew how sealed they are academically and how, after all, when you say to them "Revise your curriculum" you're hitting at the very heart of the Ph.D. they received and of their credibility. And that is a serious thing.
ED: So the knowledge that is offered gets affected by all of these political factors.
AH: By the educational system as evolved in the United States. Remember it was largely based on England, the mother country, and on the whole Nordic kind of tradition. It has never been an education of the people of the United States. Even the South--South Europe wasn't really expected here. And I can remember when the Germans, for instance—Germans, Irish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, English were about the group expected and wanted. Now the others came in as--really as scab labor. That's why it's so ridiculous the labor movement didn't embrace us immediately to save their own skins. But they didn't. But they came out of the same kind of need into this country. And the South Europeans who came were not expected. Who wanted a Greek? In spite of the discussion of Greek democracy who wanted Greeks here? Who wanted Italians here? They were not an acceptable pot. Who wanted Jews? And the Jews who were German got a better break here than those who were not German because the rest of the world--and therefore so, even the Germans--didn't want them. So that they were not in either. But...
ED: This is interesting to put this in this country of how really North European this country was supposed to be.
AH: North, yes. They called England the mother country. We still watch what happens in London more than we do almost any place else. Now there were French here, there were Spanish, Spanish... Africans and Spanish were really the early people here, leaving out the people we always leave out, unfortunately, the Indian.﻿Page 205
ED: Who was Native American, yes.
AH: And he was the real first American. But anyway, all of these things, you see, began to come together. And I remembered the Senegalese and how they saved France--the Senegalese soldiers. Before I knew it, I had the package in hand. The West came out of the fantastic civilization of Africa. Out of their blood and guts and out of their products, and out of their minerals, and out of their diamonds.
ED: And now historians are, archaeologists, anthropologists are
admitting that the cradle of civilization, beginning of man, really comes from Africa...
AH: With great hesitation, you know, very few people realize that Cairo is Africa. I have in my book Cairo, Africa. And one of my readers said to me, "Why do you put Africa there?" I said, "Because of the ignorance of my country." She had to laugh. [laughter]
ED: We had a sister-in-law once, Don's brother was married to a girl who was born in Cairo, and she was white, and so we used to always remind her that she was the only...
AH: African in your family.
ED: Well, she was the only present-day African in our family. All the rest of us were claiming it, and I think she was denying it. So busy calling herself an Egyptian.
AH: Well, at that Conference of African Women and Women of African
Descent, they had representatives from Egypt. And I'll never forget it. The speaker for Egypt said, "We are one nation." And of course...
ED: Oh, enlightened.
AH: Oh yes, and this was in Nkrumah's pitch. This is why he had to be
eliminated. 'Cause he talked about the United States of Africa, and that's what it should have been. And right now we're seeing all of the devastation. Well anyway,...
ED: Is your consultant firm still in operation?
AH: I have to say...
ED: Except for the interruption of the illness, that is.
AH: Well we've had--in the last two-and-a-half years we have done
relatively little, because I simply had to pick up on a home regime. By the way I'm getting ready to lecture women libbers--women libbers, having been one of the people part of the original development of NOW, the National Organization for Women.
ED: Yes, right, you shared that with us.﻿Page 206
AH: So, as I say, I'm about to talk with them. Because I had to pick up a rigorous health schedule with my husband, and by the way it has benefited me too because I've learned so much about nutrition. I had never bothered. Nutrition and physical therapy and the significance of mental therapy. All of these have been part of the package. So, I've done only a few things. For instance, a college address or so, a high school group, a few committees on which I serve, in mental health, in alcoholism, drugs, that sort of thing.
ED: Do you serve on the alcoholism committee with Rose Shapiro?
AH: No, she was on the Committee on Aging, I served on that too. And with Alice Rolke, who was one of the persons I'd helped train way back in the emergency relief days, so it was kind of interesting.
ED: You're presently serving on those committees you just named...
AH: At present, no.
ED: ...and National Conference of Christians and Jews, are you not?
AH: Yes. I have--we tamed that vice, just because they just insisted they wanted me to do a hearing thing for the International Year of the Child, and I'm working on that now. And they wanted me to do a seminar on education, and I have finished that. So I have stayed with them for that, and I've stayed with the United Seamen's Service because we're--they're in the process of relooking, reexamining their program and planning for the future. There I'm serving on the nominating committee and the board. I'm especially interested in the nominating committee, because I want some people, somebody to follow me, I want to confine myself to writing and special kinds of events.
ED: Well now, that leads us to my next area of thought with you, which is how do you look at the future? First of all, what have we left out in talking to you? We--oh, I know one thing that I wanted to--before we picked up, and that is I wanted to say a little bit more about your family that we left out in the earlier parts. I hope we're not having too much interference, the library has now opened and there are people coming in and out. Let me check it.
You left home, of course, after graduation, and you've taken your first teaching job, and we didn't go back to your home town again. Could you share with us when your father and/or mother died, and where, and any circumstances?
AH: My father died in New York, in 1940.
ED: Had he come here to live with you?
AH: Well what happened was strange. My mother came for just a visit
with my sister, who lives here. And she took sick. And at the time I had an apartment--my husband and I had an apartment in the Bronx, in his mother and father's two-family house. And they rented that first floor apartment of us, and we went there to live. She was very ill, and so I sent for my father, he came and..﻿Page 207
ED: Leaving the original homestead that you had left, were th^y still living there?
AH: No, no, they were not. They had eliminated that long ago.
ED: And had moved where, to another city or in the same city?
AH: To St. Paul, Minnesota.
ED: And they were living there, your mother and father.
AH: Yes.
ED: And the children, by now, had all grown and gone?
AH: Yes.
ED: So you sent for your father.
AH: To be with her. And that was a very--that was while I was working in Brooklyn at the Emergency Relief Bureau, remember I said? So, that was how that happened. And he died here at the old Edgecombe Sanitarium.
ED: Oh, and in what year, do you happen to recall the year?
AH: Yes. 1940. I've said that.
ED: Now, how about your mother. When he came here, did she die, beforehand?
AH: No, no. She died after he did. She remained...
ED: Is that so.
AH: Yes. In the meantime, I took very sick, I was very sick. I had a strep throat that was just horrible, so mother and--mother went to. . .
ED: She had been living at the home of your sister.
AH: Went to Dayton, Ohio, with another sister. And she died in '43.
ED: In Ohio.
AH: In Ohio. Both of them buried here in Cypress Hills.
ED: Now, you have brothers and sisters. Let's identify them for purposes of history. You are the oldest, Ann.
AH: Well, let me say, my mother had one child first, Charles Parker, a boy. He died very early, and I was the next child. My name is Anna, named Anna Marie Arnold. Named Anna for my father's sister, whom he adored. I think I mentioned that. Then Marie, Marie for my mother, so I was Anna Marie. Then came Blanche, the second sister. The one I described, you know, as having the blue eyes, and always being shown, and golden hair.﻿Page 208
ED: You had described her as a young child. But presently, is she living?
AH: Yes, she'll be here Thursday, by the way.
ED: Where does she live, and is she married?
AH: Yes. Blanche was the second one, she is married to Dr. James
Parsons, a scientist, whom I'm going to interview this week about the nuclear energy situation.
ED: Just for your own tapes or for radio?
AH: For my tapes. He is the second Negro graduate of Rensselaer School of Technology, and has been a...
ED: In Albany.
AH: No, at Rome, New York. And he's been a part of--he was a part of
the Duriron plant, which is a very famous one in Dayton, Ohio, where he was born. And he went South to teach when he had finished--when he retired from the Duriron plant, he had, by the way, ten patents--governmental patents--in his whole field, metallurgical field. He went south to teach at a college there, a Negro college, and then came back to Columbus and taught at Ohio State.
ED: And is that where they are now?
AH: No, they moved from Columbus back to Dayton, and he is doing a
program of teaching math and science to dropouts, three days a week. In the meantime I talked with him about the nuclear energy. I've always checked scientific things with him, see, I have to use all specialties because I have none. So I always check the scientific things, and he said to me that he is opposed to nuclear energy, and I was very glad to hear it because I am without the scientific background, so I'm going to interview him when he comes with my sister, on Thursday, just for a family visit.
ED: Someday I hope I can hear that tape, because I'd like to hear the scientific report too.
AH: And I'm going to interview my sister, too, because she was one of
the first girl reserve secretaries in the YWCA, at Dayton, Ohio, and that's how she happened to know her husband. O.K. Now the third sister.
ED: I see. You should get her onto your YWCA paper, we'll talk about that later.
AH: Oh, I'm going to. No, no. I'm interviewing him, that's the reason I asked just now whether this place is open all day because I want to do him in the morning, and do her in the afternoon.
ED: And share hers with the YWCA project, you know.
AH: Huh?﻿Page 209
ED: Well, we'll talk about that afterwards. Now the third child, the next child?
AH: Grace. Yes, Grace was the one with the long curls that everybody raved about, and she looked like a little doll, everyone wanted to pick her up. Well, anyway, Grace came to New York, taught school at Riverdale--she's a graduate of the University of Minnesota--taught school at Riverdale.
ED: The public or the private Riverdale? The public school there or up in the Riverdale?
AH: No, the private Riverdale.
ED: Yes. Riverdale School for Girls and Boys.
AH: That's right. And then married William G. Holly, who was also a scientific person, interested essentially in chemistry. And they have two... Oh, I didn't mention Blanche's children--oh dear--I'll do the children at the end. And she and William Holly lived on Long Island. And his mother was an interesting person because she was a school teacher. So there is Grace.
ED: Now then, tell us about the children now.
AH: No, I have to tell you about my two brothers.
ED: Yeah, I was going to do the children of the children all along and come back.
AH: No, not all along, but after. William James Arnold III is my
brother, and he was in the Department of Welfare as a top supervisor for a number of years, he's now retired, and they live in New Jersey. He married a Katherine Braithwaite...
ED: The daughter of William Stanley Braithwaite.
AH: Daughter of William Stanley Braithwaite, the man who discovered most of the significant poets of his time, and wrote poetry himself. And had a very fascinating New England background.
ED: And was one of my mother's first boyfriends.
AH: And your mother was a beautiful woman.
ED: He wrote a poem to her, and when he died his children gave us a copy of the original poem, it was called "To B.V.T.", Betsy Virginia Trotter.
AH: That's wonderful.
ED: Way, way back. And we interviewed Mrs. Braithwaite for this
project, the Black Women Oral History Project. We have interviewed her in terms of her observation of life at the early part of the century, the people who came and went in her--her and her husband's life...﻿Page 210
