Ms. Marcia Greenlee:
This is part one of an interview with Mrs. Virginia Clark Gayton. The interview is taking place at Mrs. Gayton's home, 824 32nd Avenue South, Seattle, Washington, 98144. The date is August 1, 1977. The interviewer is Marcia Greenlee.
Mrs. Gayton, how would you describe your life's work? Have you worked mainly inside or outside your home?
I've worked for twenty years, twenty-one years, outside the home, the main part of it, the twenty-one years in the post office and I worked two years as a dietician's aide in a hospital. But the other part of my life I raised a family. That was when I first went to work; why, that was when the children were sort of able to help each other and look after the other children. Of course, when I came over here to Seattle, before I was married and for a short time afterwards, I worked at the Seattle Cap Company, the power machine operator. But I tried working at that for a month or so, but it didn't...with a young baby and all it didn't work out.
So do you consider yourself primarily a businesswoman or primarily wife and mother? Or both?
Well, I consider both, and a small part in the community I was active. And took part in school activities, YWCA, the Urban League, the NAACP and the Delta Sigma Theta sorority later on, and the Links, Incorporated. So I was active in the community, but no other paid jobs.
Yes. Now, would you discuss your family background? You were born on the 26th of August, 1902, in Nashville. Tennessee, and two months﻿2
MG: (cont.'d) later you and your mother returned to your father in
Spokane, Washington. How did your parents come to be in Spokane?
VG: They both taught school. My mother was born in Nashville; my
father was born in Canada, Windsor, Ontario. But they both taught school in Nashville, Tennessee, And my father became active in politics during the Reconstruction, and thought he had been able to obtain a position in politics, but like so often happens in politics, it didn't turn out that way, and the fact that school teaching didn't pay very much, why, he wanted to get some job that paid more. At that time the Pullman Company began to hire black men as porters and waiters and so forth, so he went up to Canada first, and worked for the Canadian Pacific as a porter, and then eventually with the Great Northern Railroad that went into Spokane, Washington. And Spokane was one of the terminals of the railroad at that time and so he—I don't remember how many years after, how long he worked, not many years, maybe five years with the railroad company—so then he decided he wanted to have a more permanent residence to raise a family, so he looked about for other employment. But at that time the only employment black men, regardless of the qualifications, could get was labor and menial work, waiting tables, and railroad porters, and such as that. And that's what he did, mostly, after he lived in Spokane.
MG: Could you tell me some more about your father's background? Before he came to Spokane, we know he was born in Canada, and his name was Cyrus Nathaniel Clarke* Do you know what year he was born?
VG: Let me see. I should remember it. About 1866.
MG: How did his family come to be in Canada? And could you tell us something about his background?
VG: His father's background was, he was born in slavery in Kentucky,
around Lexington, Kentucky. And his father was active in the abolitionist work, especially after he escaped from slavery. His father escaped from slavery in Lexington, Kentucky, and so after he escaped he went up through Ohio, and then up to Windsor, Ontario, where the family lived...and my father was born. See, that was in a rural area, and the schooling facilities weren't good there, so he had made up his mind he wanted his family to have an education, so then they moved down to Oberlin, Ohio. The family lived there until his mother died, and then some of the children were farmed out into different families. They were raised first by their aunt, Aunt Laura, who raised the family until some of them found jobs with white families. My father finished high school soon after, in Oberlin, and then soon after that he went to live with an aunt or uncle in Nashville, Tennessee.
MG: Could you say something about your grandfather's background? That was very interesting.
* the final letter e_ was later dropped﻿3
VG: Yes. My grandfather, my father's father, was... From reliable resources I can show that he was the man from whom Harriet Beecher Stowe created the character in her book, Uncle Tom's Cabin, of George Harris. She told of the experiences that he had, his escape from slavery, and she based that character on my grandfather's life.
MG: Yes, that can be found in Harriet Beecher Stowe's book, The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin.
VG: Yes. The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin... The book Uncle Tom's Cabin created quite a furor, and was also the basis not only for, I read in the foreword of Uncle Tom's Cabin, not only the bas is for antislavery movement, but it was a feminist movement also. So she explains all the facts about Uncle Tom's Cabin and how it came to be written, in The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin.
MG: And then your grandfather and a brother, Milton, wrote a book about their experiences.
VG: Yes, that book is called... The book company's title of Anti-Slavery Crusade, the name of the book was Sufferings of Lewis and Milton Clarke.-
MG: And that was published in 1846.
VG: Yes.
MG: Well, now is there anything else that you might say about your father?
VG: Well, the main story, wherever we lived he was, and my mother also, they were active in the community, in church, and kept us informed, and raised us children up on the outstanding story of Negro history and background. And we were brought up in that atmosphere in Spokane; they told us all about their experiences in Nashville, where it was kind of the headquarters for active Negroes in the Reconstruction.
MG: Mrs. Gayton, what was the nature of the black community in Spokane?
VG: A nice, what would you say, middle-class Negro. So many of them are from good backgrounds, and there wasn't so much of a ghetto. Well, I don't know if any place had ghettos at that time, but they kept their homes nice. Would you like to see one of the books?
MG: Certainly I would, very much. What kind of social life did the black community in Spokane have?
VG: Well, they had quite a social life. I remember, even though my mother wasn't a person who played bridge, but they had a bridge club and... Not until maybe 1920, or about then, they had one man and then two men in the post office, and of course the churches were... They had the Baptist and the Methodist, that I remember, and my family were Baptists, although I used to participate at the Methodist young people's affairs. And, as I said, they had one policeman who was very well thought of.﻿4
VG: (cont.'d) They didn't have any more for many years. And then there
was one man who had his own butcher shop, and we had a printing office.
MG: So there were a few black businesses.
VG: Yes, a few. And a barber shop. So the church activities were very
prominent. I remember I had some pictures of my mother and father in groups. I don't know, I think it was a church organization. It could have been political, but I think maybe it was more likely a postcard picture of them, and it was inclined to be a church affiliated thing.
MG: Well, now, what about your mother? What was her full name?
VG: Guela Louise Johnson was her maiden name, and then she married my father.
MG: Where was she born and what was her family background?
VG: She was born in Nashville, Tennessee. Her mother was a widow. She
doesn't remember her father. And her mother made a living as a dressmaker. And those days they used to go into people's homes and make clothes; so she was a dressmaker. And they lived with a family, rented, had one room in this family home, where my mother lived when her mother was out sewing. And they raised her as their own, this family. Mr. and Mrs. Ross Moore, their name was. He was a member... they had a black fire company then, and he was a fireman. So they were well-raised people, I mean. That was their background. And I have a friend here in town, Pauline White, her name is. Anyway, her mother and father, Mr. and Mrs. Richard White, and my mother and father belonged to the Baptist church, and we used to...the families visited each other all the time. So it happens Miss Pauline White lives here now, and we went to the first grade together.
MG: How many children were in your family?
VG: There were five children. Three boys and two girls.
MG: Two girls and three boys. And you were the eldest child, is that right?
VG: Yes.
MG: Now what were their names?
VG: This is the oldest boy, and that's my next one. That's Cyrus.
MG: Cyrus, junior?
VG: Yes.
MG: He's the second child.
VG: He lives in Passaic, New Jersey, now retired. And then seven years
passed, and then John Clark, he's the only one of us who has died. He died about five years ago. And then my sister, Ruth, and she lives here in Seattle. Then my youngest brother, James Clark. And he's been﻿5
VG: (cont.'d) a merchant seaman all his life; he's second mate on ships when he goes out to sea.
MG: Is your sister Ruth, does she have a married name?
VG: Yes, Ruth Cox.
MG: What was your relationship like with your siblings? Were you very close? Did you share interests in common?
VG: Oh, yes. I guess the fact that I was the oldest, ten years or more
older than two others, although just my brother and I were about three years apart. So we had a good relationship, and I used to help my mother with the children. In those days they had the old-fashioned way of rocking the children to sleep, and singing to them, telling stories or reading, and it was my job to get them to sleep. I used to make the sound of all the different animals and all to try to get them to sleep.
MG: What are some of your earliest childhood memories?
VG: The earliest? I think the first house we lived in, I remember that it was not far out of town and had a picket fence around it, and I used to stand by the picket fence and look at the street to see what was going on. And then another memory was when my grandmother came out to live with us. Just about the time my oldest brother was to be born, she came to live with us. And she lived with us until she died.
MG: What was her name?
VG: Jenny Johnson.
MG: What events stand out in your mind from your youth and your young adulthood?
VG: Well, the thing I remember especially is when I was an adolescent and younger... In those days things were so strict, most of our social life was a Sunday school picnic and activities around the church, and so it wasn't a large group of people but it was nice and close. Remembering Sunday school picnics and going to circuses. We had a young—they were young friends, a young couple had no children—they'd drop in the house often and we'd say, "Have dinner, sit right down." And we'd always have enough for people to drop in. And they would take my brother and me and—the husband worked at night—they'd take us to a show. And so we really had a happy childhood. In adolescence things began to get different. White schoolmates who would be friendly to you in grade school, why, then they would not know you in high school.
MG: These are white friends?
VG: Yes.
MG: Well, let's talk a little bit about your formal education. Where did you go to school in Spokane?﻿6
VG: I went to the McKinley Grade School and the Lewis and Clark High School.
MG: And what are your memories of that experience? Are there particular incidents or teachers that stand out in your mind?
VG: Well, you know how things were at that time, most of us just took things for granted. But we certainly were left out of most of the activities, sports and social life. Very often when they'd pick sides, for a game or spelling bee, why, everybody would be picked except the black child. The organizations of the school, at the high school, why, we didn't participate in them except graduation, of course.
MG: You were simply excluded from those?
VG: Yes.
MG: What about the teachers' attitudes toward you?
VG: Well, I think on the whole they were very good. I remember in high school I didn't have any... When I finished the eighth grade, why, the teacher I had then, she made a big Impression on me and encouraged me to write, and so she encouraged me, and I was on the program for the graduation. I wasn't a brilliant student, but I was a good student. I didn't have to worry about being promoted or anything like that. And I got A grades in some. I don't think I ever got...a D in chemistry once. I got a D once in chemistry.
MG: What about your education after high school?
VG: I left Spokane in June, 1920. That's when I finished high school. And I went up to Vancouver where my family lived. Vancouver, British Columbia, they lived there. So I stayed there for the summer and in the fall, my aunt and uncle in Washington, D.C*, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Baker, had no children so they wanted to have me come, and they wanted to send me to Howard University. She had wanted me to come when I was entering high school, but my mother didn't want me to leave home so young, even though she had four others. My father sent me to Washington, D.C., to attend Howard University in the fall of 1920.
MG: What was your aunt's name?
VG: Her married name or...
MG: Both.
VG: Her name was Letitia Clark, my father's sister, when she was with her family. Her name was Letitia Clark. But when she got old enough to sort of work out, help out, a white woman sent her to school and then she changed her name to Violetta C. Baker.
MG: Baker was her married name?﻿7
VG: Yes.
MG: So she changed her first name to Violetta?
VG: Yes.
MG: I see. And her husband was Henry Baker. Maybe you'd like to say a couple of things about him.
VG: Yes. My aunt worked in the Library of Congress, and she had taught
bookkeeping and business subjects at Howard before it became a college. My uncle was from Mississippi, and he was appointed to Annapolis as a young man of sixteen or seventeen, and he attended Annapolis. I don't know whether he finished the year out, because the treatment was so mean and prejudiced that he couldn't endure it, so he left Annapolis, and he went to Howard University and finished at the law school there. I don't know why he never practiced, but what he did do was work for the U. S. Patent Office as second assistant examiner, and he became in-" terested In patents that Negroes had made. There was no record of any Negro even having the ability to invent anything, so it was thought. So he made a collection and researched and found about three thousand-some names of Negro inventors. He had a display at the World's Fair, I think it was in Chicago, about 1893. His exhibit was the main resource for information about the Negro in invention.
MG: And the pamphlet that he published?
VG: It's published by...the American Negro, it's a book that was printed, it's about him. "The American Negro, His History and Literature" was the name of the series, and the name of the pamphlet was The Colored Inventor, by Henry E. Baker.
MG: Now while you were in Washington, D.C., then you attended Howard and did you work also?
VG: No, very few women were able to work and go to school. If they did, it was such drudgery and almost impossible.
MG: What was the time here, about 1920?
VG: When I entered Howard University? 1920. Yes, my aunt became ill,
and so after I finished two years, why, I came back home because she became ill and died soon after. I worked one summer when I was at Howard. I worked at the Library of Congress as a messenger. I got my appointment through Senator Jones of Washington State and a civil service exam.
MG: Oh, is that right? Now how did your parents feel about the education of a daughter? What were their attitudes toward higher education for a daughter?
VG: Well, we just took it for granted that we would go as far as possible. I mean, the conversation and all of the... My mother and father, having lived and taught school in Nashville, where there was so much infor-﻿8
VG: (cont.'d) mation about Negro history, the Fisk Jubilee Singers,
Reconstruction, we knew all about this. My father and mother told us all of the outstanding Negroes who were doing things. I think she has an autograph book where she has J. C. Napier, who was a black registrar of the treasury, and my father told me his history, and background of his father and his activities. My father was a very smart, intelligent man, and he loved his family and was joking and always would read to us, so that I often wish my father had lived so some of the grandchildren could have known him. He told us of our African heritage. When the Negroes got their vote, they valued it. My father wouldn't miss a chance to vote and participate in the community..
MG: The family atmosphere was both stimulating and supportive for your educational career.
VG: Yes. Participation in the environment, you know, take part in civic activities.
MG: What has been the role of religion in your life?
VG: Well, we are and always were church-attending people. I don't think
there are any ministers in our background, but my father, usually they had him treasurer or secretary of whatever organizations he belonged to, the Masons. He belonged to the Masons, and was active in that. Wherever we went, even when we lived in Vancouver, British Columbia, they had just a small church, the first thing we did, the family did, was to connect with the church.
MG: Now apart from the influence of your parents, are there any nonrelated
persons or other relatives that you sort of focus on as important influences in your life?
VG: Well, the fact that I went to live with my aunt and uncle, they were
an influence. And I guess the main influence, especially intellectual or educational, was in the family.
MG: Do you feel that the environment in which you lived, the geographic
environment I'm talking about now, had any important influence on you? I mean the fact that you grew up in Spokane, say, instead of Nashville?
VG: Oh, yes. Oh, certainly, even though black people weren't recognized so much in Spokane as far as participating, but still, they didn't make any effort to keep us from voting or participating. Schools were not segregated. I know when I went back to Washington, the conditions there were a lot different than they are today. I remember we were going to take the bus and ride over to Thomas Jefferson's home, Monticello, and to what was Washington's, Mount Vernon, we were going to sightsee and go to Mount Vernon, so we got on the bus. And of course, I didn't know, and I was going to sit right down in the front of the bus, and my uncle said, "Oh, no, no, come back here, come back here." So...﻿9
MG: That was very different from Spokane.
VG: Yes. I don't remember whether they segregated colored people in the theaters in Spokane. I don't have any idea on that, although they said they did here in Seattle.
MG: In 1926, the 25th of April, you married John Gayton.
VG: Yes.
MG: Could you tell me something about your husband? How did you meet? And something about his background.
VG: Well, how I happened to come to Seattle. In Vancouver I had a friend, Clara James, who had lived there for some time. So she had gone to the University of British Columbia there, and her ambition was to be a pharmacist, so she came here, in Seattle, to live at the YMCA and to study pharmacy out at the University of Washington, in which she eventually graduated. In Vancouver, British Columbia, there were no decent jobs, or very few; the atmosphere wasn't very progressive.
MG: This was in Vancouver?
VG: Yes. So my friend said, Why not come down and live with her in Seattle? So that's where I came first, to live at the YWCA. At that time it was called the Phillis Wheatley YWCA, all black.
MG: What time period was this, do you remember?
VG: About 1923 or 1924.
MG: You were just saying something about your work in Vancouver before coming to Seattle.
VG: Yes. I was working as a power machine operator, just a small cap factory, and it was very kind of a primitive way. It wasn't very clean, but anyway it was six dollars a week more than I was making, so then I wanted to get more. I didn't like power machine operating. So I applied and got a job as a dental assistant. But I went on my own. I didn't tell the manager what I was; I just went and got the job. So later I worked as a dental assistant until I came to Seattle. About a year I worked there. So when I came here, of course I was looking for a job, and there were better opportunities here, but I didn't have any particular skills. I had started taking a bookkeeping course in high school, but it wasn't enough to work on. And I didn't know anything about catering, like so many; I mean, there wasn't a field for that. And so I got a job. A job which I wasn't anxious to get was working a power machine at Seattle Cap Company. And I did the same thing there; I just went and got a job and said nothing about my race. Soon after that, I worked just before I got married, and so it happened I was going with my husband, and it happened that the owner, who sold caps to the men's haberdashery, knew my husband, and so I guess he﻿10
VG: (cont.'d) realized who I was by my name. My husband worked at the haberdashery.
HG: So then he realized your race at that time.
VG: I think, but they never said anything to the other help, so I don't know whether they knew or not.
MG: They didn't try to terminate your employment.
VG: No. They were good friends and it happened when we moved up in Madrona district, why, they lived up in that district.
MG: What was this man's name from the Seattle Cap Company?
VG: I can't think of his name. I might think of it...Mr. Sudick.
MG: There's something that just occurs to me that I didn't ask you earlier on as we were discussing your family experiences and all in Vancouver. Why was the move made from Spokane to Vancouver?
VG: Oh. See, there were five children, and my father wasn't making much
money, and he had worked for the Canadian Pacific years ago, and he had always thought that there was a chance there for a better job. So he went up there to work on this Canadian Pacific Railroad. It happened that right after he got there, they had a strike on, and he was about a year or more before he started to work.
MG: So he went out there for a year's unemployment, not knowing what the conditions were.
VG: Not knowing, yes. So that really was a hard time for my family, and
they never really recovered from that. Because after he got work there for a while, why, he injured his wrist and had to wear a cast... Anyway, he had to get just an ordinary labor job after the railroad, and he worked until just before... While I was down here in Seattle, after I was married, he had a mild stroke. I think it was because he worked at this one place and he'd been promised a job for the rest of his life; it changed hands and he was out, being an older man. I think that must have been the reason why he had the stroke, and then he just... It changed his personality, and he was partially crippled, so he couldn't move. He was such a wonderful, intelligent disposition, and we all lived together with my grandmother. They had the southern manner; he used to call her Miss Jenny, and she called him Mr. Cy. It was just a nice, warm atmosphere. Everything is so different now. I read some of the letters that they got from people in Nashville, and how in those days they used flowery and endearing words and language. I felt it took its toll, this misfortune of my father, just took its toll on the family. Of course, soon after that everyone had such a hard time, you know, during the depression.﻿11
MG: Well, he had such a long struggle too, to find suitable employment to support the family.
VG: Yes.
MG: Did your mother ever contemplate work? You said earlier that she had taught in Nashville.
VG: No, she never went out to work, because she hadn't had any experience in housework. And out here, there were no black teachers.
MG: That was all that was available.
VG: Yes. And then they had the five children, so she wasn't able to. I wish my father were to see how well my family progressed. So we hope they do know.
MG: Yes, yes. Now, your husband, we had just begun to talk about him. You met him while you were working for the Seattle Cap Company.
VG: Yes.
MG: Now, he had been in Seattle for a long time?
VG: He was born here.
MG: What year was that?
VG: He was born in 1899. His father had come here in 1889.
MG: His father was John T. Gayton, and he came from Mississippi, was it?
VG: Yes* Yazoo, Mississippi.
MG: What was your husband's employment?
VG: Most of the time he was a salesman, partial salesman and janitor for a men's haberdashery most of his time, and then later on, of course, he was the deputy sheriff, and then after that he was appointed to the post office as a guard, from which he retired. His talent and interest was music, which he loved. He was a dramatic tenor, and very active in musical circles and in the community musically.
MG: I see. Just for the record, now, we have your father-in-law's name. What was your mother-in-law's name?
VG: Magnolia Scott, that's the name of the people who raised her. She was an orphan. It was a white family.
MG: Where did she come from?﻿12
VG: She came from Nashville, too!
MG: Is that right? So did they meet here, your parents-in-law?
VG: Yes.
MG: Interesting. Now you have, you and your husband have several children. Would you tell me their names starting with the eldest, and maybe whatever else you'd like to say about each one of them.
VG: Okay. Yes, I have eight children, three girls and five boys. The oldest... I had two girls and then five boys, and then a girl who's the youngest. My oldest daughter's name is Guela Johnson.
MG: This is after your mother?
VG: Yes. Guela Gayton. She had one daughter named Virginia Humes, and then she was divorced and married Oscar D. Johnson, and they have one girl Gail.
MG: She's the eldest child?
VG: Yes. And the next is Sylvia Greene—now her name is Wesley, but Greene is the name of all her four children, three girls and a boy. Do you want the oldest of her children?
MG: Well, I think just your children will be enough.
VG: Yes.
MG: Now, she 's the second daughter?
VG: Yes. Sylvia Greene Wesley. And my oldest daughter... Do you want to know their jobs?
MG: Yes, whatever you'd like to say about them.
VG: Well, right now my oldest daughter, she has her master's degree in
librarianship and is head of the University of Washington Social Work Library. And my second daughter, Sylvia Greene Wesley, she is a teacher and counselor in special education at Franklin High School. Now the oldest boy, my next child, is John C. Gayton. He was the first employed by Olympia Brewery, and he was in California for about ten years as a distributor. And then he worked for personnel in United Airlines, but he wanted to go in business for himself, so now he's a management consultant and in insurance. Gary Gayton is the next son. He graduated and attended the University of Washington. In school and high school he was a sprinter and did very well and that helped him out somewhat financially. But most of them earned their own way, mostly themselves. When he finished Gonzaga, why, he was over here and he was assistant district attorney to Brock Adams.﻿13
MG: So Gonzaga was for law school?
VG: Yes.
MG: And the UW was for his undergraduate degree?
VG: Yes, a political science degree.
MG: And then he worked for Brock Adams, you say?
VG: Yes, as a U.S. district attorney. He was quite active in school activities and was on the honor roll in high school and on that board that they had...president of the student body. And then he ran for the University of Washington too. And after he worked for Brock Adams, I think he spent ten or eleven years in a law partnership and did very well there, and now he's been appointed as a special assistant to Brock Adams in the Department of Transportation.
MG: Yes, Adams is the secretary of transportation.
VG: Yes. The next one, Philip. Both the boys, all the boys participated in sports. Well, Philip is the next boy, and he went to Washington State for a while, but it became too difficult financially to get the money together, so he went on his own for a series of different jobs. He was the first black that the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company had. And perhaps I neglected to mention that Johnny got his appointment from West Point, but because he had flat feet or something, he couldn't go. Gary worked for the Washington State Tax Title Company in Spokane when he was attending Gonzaga. So Philip now, he went to Washington State, and then on several different jobs, and then worked for Metropolitan Life Insurance. So then, I can't remember how he has a partner, in partnership with Lee Rowell. I think it was some kind of a management investment department, but now he owns one nursing home and is doing very well. He's planning on building a retirement condominium on Seneca and Boren, so he's doing very well financially and independently.
Now the next son, that's Carver. Carver played football in high school and became active in football, so when he graduated to go to the University of Washington he was in football, and then went to the Rose Bowl and played. He was in the Rose Bowl game. When he finished in the university, he became a teacher at Garfield High School. And then he applied for and was appointed to the—after teaching for a while—he was appointed to the F.B.I. and he worked three years for them. And then when he did his three years, then he worked as a security officer in personnel at an airplane company in California. Then they called him up here. He was asked to come back and work for the University of Washington athletic department. Then when they started to have this unrest and all at the university...
MG: In the sixties?﻿14
VG: Yes, that's why they called him, to sort of work with the blacks, I
guess, in the athletic department, as assistant coach. Well, they had this confusion there, and so he wasn't satisfied with how things had worked out, as far as he was concerned, in the athletic department, so he was appointed to Minority Affairs, vice-president in Minority Affairs. And also he was teaching; last year he got his master's. He just got his doctorate in political science at the university, and now he is going to Florida State to teach and research, at Florida State in Tallahassee.
MG: In political science?
VG: Yes. And management counseling, as a consultant. Anything else about him you want to know?
MG: No, that's fine, I think.
VG: Gary's not married now, but...and Carver, he's not married right now, so this month he's leaving for Tallahassee.
MG: Now who comes after Carver? There's one more son?
VG: Yes, Leonard. He finished high school at Garfield like all of them, and then he went in the service. Of course, I didn't mention that John and Gary were in the service too. And he went in the service after high school and spent eighteen months or two years in Europe. When he came back, why, he got a job with the Darigold Distributor, and he was the first black, I think, they had hired. Then he attended the University of Washington for three years, but he decided he wanted to work. He needed more money before he finished the third year, so he's now working for the United Parcel Company.
And my youngest daughter, youngest child is Elaine Whitehead. And she has a little boy. She finished in Garfield, and she decided not to go to the U right after. I was rather disappointed she didn't go to the U as soon as she finished high school, but anyway she met a young man and married him and had a little boy. They didn't get along, so after eight years, they divorced. So she's still going to school until the end of this school year and hoping to finish there in communications.
MG: Now,„did you and your husband have any sort of conscious philosophy or goals or objectives as you were raising your children?
VG: Well, I guess just like we'd both been brought up in families who believed in encouraging the children, and we just took it for granted that they were going to—and they did, too—and they all worked their way through. We weren't able to, till I left to work, though even when I went to work too, we weren't able to help them too much financially. Of course, they always had room and board whenever they wanted it.
MG: When did you go to work again?﻿15
VG: Well, I started when they had sent most of the men to the war.
MG: The Second World War, of course.
VG: Yeah, the Second World War. Well, they were short of help at the post office, so I applied to work at one Christmas. So I worked about six months, and then I became pregnant, I had six children, I guess, and so when I became pregnant, I decided it was too much to try to keep on working, so I didn't come back until 1947. Then they were opening the rolls to women again. First they put them all off, then they asked for more women. So I went and took the civil service exam, and I got a good mark in it, but they said I was too short. 'Course I worked in the post office when I was the same height, but... [laughter]
MG: Then you suddenly became too short.
VG: Yes. But anyway, I had to wait a year before that law was... So then I went in 1947, and I worked until 1969. That was right after my husband passed. He passed in September and I went back one night and I just decided it was time to quit.
MG: Did you have any difficulties accommodating your public career, that is working at the post office, and then your role within the home? Was it' hard to make that coordination?
VG: No, I didn't, I worked in the community, but not to any large degree. I helped to organize the Delta Sigma Theta chapter here, because I became a member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority in Washington, D. C. When I came here, I didn't even say anything about being in this sorority because few people, black people didn't know anything about black sororities. So anyway, I think Mrs. Campbell came about the same time, Bertha Campbell, the same time with Idell Vertner, and she found out I was in and that was three who were Delta Sigma Theta members. Idell Vertner was from San Francisco, and of course Bertha Campbell is the national founder, Bertha Pitts Campbell. And so we organized a chapter here in 1933. 1 taught Sunday school. I was not overly active in the church, but I taught Sunday school, and I belonged to the YWCA and participated in that. And then I belonged to one or two little social clubs, and then the Links, Inc.—a national club—and I was one of the charter members of that, too. So I think that's it. I never had to hire a babysitter. There was always somebody to help.
MG: Were they good about helping and looking after each other?
VG: Yes* they were good about that.
MG: Well, let me ask you your views about some other areas. Do you have any preference among the terms colored, Negro or black?
VG: No. Well, everybody used to say colored, and black was a dirty word. It didn't matter what it was, except when you were in the black financially. And so it was colored, and then Negro. It's hard for me to get accustomed to say black, but I think in the terminology of today's society, why, it's all right. And Negro means the same thing, so...﻿16
MG: So you don't really get excited about it one way or the other.
VG: No.
MG: Okay. How would you say, looking back over your life, how would you say that your race has affected the options available to you in your life and the way that your life has developed?
VG: How would I say what?
MG: That your race...
VG: Well, I think it's been an advantage because...I guess you call me the middle class. It's always been bad, and I don't feel any...this idea of trying to blame everything on the middle class and bourgeoisie, I think that is silly. Nobody has anything to do with how they were born in this life, and everybody who's striving, is striving to be middle class or a higher place in life. I always notice that as a black in the community, and black family, and the white families why we always had a much better time.
MG: You mean in a social or cultural sense?
VG: Yes, in cultural... The average lower—class white person just is satisfied to be whatever they're born into, often. And they don't have the cultural urgency to improve. You can't say white people don't have drive, because they do, but I think it's more satisfying and necessary to be a Negro and to overcome our obstacles. We have, through our struggles, brought out an awareness of the need to change society...a better world.
MG: Now we sort of touched on it earlier, how race affected, say, your
father's employment. But now for yourself, as you pointed out, if you didn't identify yourself as being black, probably most people wouldn't know, so to that extent race simply wasn't a factor in your employment.
VG: But if I had been white, I could have prepared for, and got, a better job.
MG: Would you say then that being a woman has been maybe a greater effect
in sort of shaping the choices and options available to you in your life, greater than race? Or can you separate those two?
VG: I think being black has been a greater factor. I think when we were
brought up, we were taught to aspire to whatever we wanted to, because we all usually had the belief that things were going to get better and we should aspire to whatever we wanted to. And being a woman, I know that so many things need changing as far as women are concerned, and in some avenues I don't think there's a prejudice. I think throughout history you have heard of women who had influence on the men who were rulers and such, and they often had women who were really the power behind them. So it doesn't mean that you can't do anything to influence,﻿17
VG: (cont.'d) but I think it's a good thing now to get those obstacles
and differences of not getting equal pay and the living conditions and all of that; we have to fight for them.
MG: What is the women's movement as you see it? I mean, how would you characterize it?
VG: I think it's a good idea, but some of the things to some women...where
something that they want to get means more to them than it would for me, for instance. I never felt like...you talk now about the men having more to say or more to take part in raising the family. My husband and I, we worked together. We didn't say so much, well now, that's your work, this is mine. My husband helped me, but I never asked him to. If he wanted to, well, he did. And he helped a lot. And I never felt that I was so down or held back from anything.
MG: So do you feel that the women's movement is a good thing, or do you have some reservations about it or what?
VG: I think it's good but I guess like everything, I kind of miss my courtesies. I think it's just a natural thing for a mother to have a little more in the raising of the child than... It needs two parents; I certainly can vouch for that. But I couldn't see so much in this idea of the woman thinking that the man should not help if he wants to. I think women in all the animal life—and man is an animal—the female in most species has most to do; it's a natural thing for them to raise and protect the children, although the male in some cases protects and will feed them. To try to separate ourselves from the care of the child, I don't see that. I might be wrong.
MG: What do you consider to have been the most important achievements of your life? What are you most proud about?
VG: Well, I guess I'm proud and thankful that we raised our children to be good and productive citizens. I did a good job at the post office, but that was a means to an end.
MG: You had membership, as you've mentioned, in several organizations. Did you mention all of them? Are there any that we've missed?
VG: I became a member of YWCA when I was in Washington, D. C., that was in 1920. And so when I came here I lived at the Y, and then I became on the board of the local Y, and I was chairman of the board at one time. And also I have been on the board of the Girl Scouts, and right now I am on the board of the Ruth School for Girls. And then I was president of the sorority here. And I participated in a lot of these; some of these volunteer. I am a docent at the Burke Museum of the University of Washington, and I've been there about eight years, and I enjoy that. But I haven't felt that I want to get so absorbed in it. I'm enjoying myself now. I guess right now is probably, in a way, being free to do things at this time in my life. I think I've always enjoyed the children, even﻿18
VG: (cont.'d) though I had a large family. I never felt mad at that, and I always let the children know that each one, when they were a baby, that I was glad that you're here. I said, "I'm glad you came to live with us," as I used to tell them. Don't think that because...I was interviewed some time ago, I think it had to do with a black family thesis at the University of Washington. My husband and I, we enjoyed our family. And we didn't depend on anyone. We always had good friends. Even when money's scarce you have friends that help, and we had a lot of good friends and we've made our way.
MG: 1 was going to ask you about that. What the role of friendship had been in your life, and if there were any particular friends that you especially focused on as an important part of your experiences.
VG: Well, that's something that in a way is a changing scene. Of course, when I came here I had good friends here. Then I grew up with Pauline White and many friends in Spokane. I still keep in touch with some people in Spokane where I grew up, and here the sorority became a social. It's different now. I mean there's larger numbers. But still you feel a closeness in the sorority. So I think I've been fortunate to live as I have.
MG: Do you have any hobbies? And if so, what are they?
VG: I guess you would call reading... That's mostly what I do. I used to
make clothes for my children, but I got out of that habit. It seemed I got too busy. I had all those five boys and you don't do much sewing for boys.
MG: Well, I noticed that there are lots of books right here around us. Roots, did you watch that on television?
VG: Yes.
MG: What was your reaction?
VG: Oh, I thought it was a wonderful thing. I was so glad that both black and white could see, because not all, even the black people, had been in the position, as I had, to know about those events, how all that happened, and how many outstanding black people there were. And then the treatment of the slave, I figured, ought to be shown, that's something that ought really to be brought out. I was really happy about that, because some white people, some of them are immigrants, or sons of immigrants, and they have never had to even know of that treatment that the slaves got and how they were treated and so forth.
MG: You know a good bit of Afro-American history.
VG: Yes.
MG: You' ve done lots of reading and studying.﻿19
VG: Yes. My aunt and uncle had a nice library, and I remember some of the early prominent people, and they knew Alain Locke and friends of the family. And I met Schomburg, and Kelly Miller.
MG:	You were at Howard at a very important period.
VG:	An important time, yes.
MG:	So you say Alain Locke, Schomburg, Kelly Miller...
VG:	Montgomery Gregory.
MG:	Was Schomburg attending as a student?
VG:	No, he was in the process of getting a library together, on Negro history, you know.
MG: He was building his collection at that time?
VG: Yes.
MG: What was the last name you mentioned, Montgomery...
VG: ...Gregory. He was a professor of dramatic art.
MG: I don't think I know him.
VG: My memory is certainly... sometimes these things come back to me, but sometimes I just can't remember. Alonzo Turner, Charles Wesley. My husband was a singer, a tenor, and he was very prominent as a singer here in the Seattle community. He had planned as a young man he was going to England to study. But he changed his mind and stayed here, and had a recital.
MG: Well, maybe you could say a little bit more about your husband's family and their whole relationship to the early black community in Seattle.
VG: Yes. Well, Mr. Gayton came out here, a coachman driving a white doctor across country, to come from Mississippi to the state of Washington. I think his family had had trouble in the South, like so many did, and that was one reason why he came out, and he never wanted to go back to visit. And so he was a very ambitious person, a social person, and so he got along with white and black, and he was very aggressive. He was the first black steward of the Rainier Club. Then eventually he was appointed bailiff and law librarian at the U.S. District Court by Judge Burke, or then Judge Neterer that he worked under. And that job that he had, no black has had it since. And he made his house a social gathering place, too. He liked to play bridge and dance and have social activities here. He opened his home to newcomers, and also he used to... When foreigners were applying to become American citizens, he would train some of them, help them to study for obtaining citizenship.﻿20
MG VG MG VG MG VG MG VG MG VG MG
MG:
Was this in language or what?
Oh, I guess mainly in preparation for...
The citizenship exam?
Yes. And it was a musically interested family.
How many siblings did your husband have?
How many children did he have?
No, brothers and sisters.
He had two brothers and a sister.
Was he the eldest child?
Yes.
Are his brothers and sisters still here in Seattle? Are they still living?
VG: All that are, are here. His brother has died, and he, of course, my husband, died, but the sister and one brother are still here.
MG: Well, there was one last question that X wanted to ask you about yourself. Have you traveled, or had an interest in traveling?
VG: Yes, I'm very interested. I had several trips. Once I went to a Boule when Gary was a member of the Boul^ and they had the convention in Miami, and I was his guest there. Of course, when I went to Howard, that was a trip. I went through the Canadian Rockies and down, and it took six days to get there then. And I have relatives in Ohio on both sides. My mother's family had relatives in Akron and Cleveland, and just in recent years did I really get in touch, to go and see them. And so Cousin Raymond Davis who has kept up my father's history, why, I went to visit him. And so I've been to two or three conventions, and I've been to Europe on one trip, and once to Hawaii. My son John, who worked for United Airlines for a while, helped me.
That was a perfect opportunity.
VG: Yes. I was taking advantage of that because I didn't know how long I'd be here. So I hope my next trip, I'd like to go to the Caribbean. I enjoy traveling. I've heard people say they're afraid of flying, but I never was a person... Maybe I'm rather stoical, you know, because I don't worry about something like that, that you have no control over.
MG: That's true. Once you're up there.﻿21
MG: This is part two of an interview with Mrs. Virginia Clark Gayton. The interview continues in Mrs. Gayton's home.
Mrs. Gayton, at our last session I asked you something about your hobbies, and you have indicated that there is more you might have said in that area.
VG: When I say my hobbies, I guess I can say it's books and reading, and especially I have read books on African and Afro-American history. They've been my main concern. Also, during the past ten years, I have acted as a docent in the Burke Museum of the University of Washington. The training we took for that had to do with archaeology, anthropology, and geology, and bird life, ornithology, and the study of shells, as well as of the countries and peoples of the Pacific rim. In our tours of the museum, especially, the main item was the study of the Northwest Coast Indians. So studies along those lines are things that I have been doing. Studies that I have made, and books, and lectures that I have attended, especially the Northwest Coast Indian. That has been the emphasis that I have made, especially because you can tell the children about it, to give them an understanding of this environment. The Northwest Coast is the area from northern California to southern Alaska, and it'll include the study also of Eskimos, and that is quite an interesting field.
MG: Well, I'd like to ask you some questions now about the black community in Seattle. You were a very early resident here, and your impressions and information about the black community, I think, would be very valuable. You came to Seattle in 1922—what was it, '24? At that time do you have an impression of how large the black community was?
VG: I think it must have been about three thousand at that time. To a
degree, they lived in a small area, but yet there were quite a number who lived out in all locations, because there was not a large enough number to bother the white people. They owned homes and they had some small businesses, when you consider the number and population and how far out from the East Coast Seattle was, and they had a good representing of professional people.
MG: Now what were some of these districts and areas of the city where they lived?
VG: They lived somewhere in this location down near Jackson Street, the area around where the Oriental and international district is.
MG: Do we call this Mount Baker?
VG: Yes, of course we call it the Leschi district, down toward the lake there.
^G: The Leschi?﻿22
VG: Yes, but I think quite a number lived just immediately west of my home, down from 23rd around to 31st or 32nd, but not very many people as far as Mount Baker itself. Why, there were only one or two people had homes, really, in the Mount Baker district. Mr. Stone was a caterer, and he had a home on 31st South, and then there was another family nearby where my brother-in-law, Leonard Gayton, is, his mother-in-law— her name was Mrs. Adams at that time—and she owned property right on 31st South. And then there were some out in the Green Lake district, too, and then they started from, say, 7th and Madison. My husband was born right near 7th and Madison. And then it went east and they followed Madison Street, because they lived on both sides. They were scattered up all the way up from 8th and Madison until they got down to, say, where Empire Way is now. It used to be a valley down there.
MG:	Did that area have a name?
VG:	It was called Coon Hollow.
MG:	Coon Hollow.
VG:	They say it was because there were raccoons there.
MG:	You have your doubts?
VG:	Yes. [laughter]
MG:	Were there any other areas?
VG:	Well, not specifically that I know.
MG:	How did the blacks... There were some in Ballard?
VG:	Yes.
MG:	How did the blacks in Ballard and Green Lake come to settle there? Do you know?
VG: No, I don't know that.
MG: I just wondered if there was some attraction, employment or something else, that might have led them there.
VG: It might have been just a real estate development or something...property.
MG: I see. Now do you know anything about the origins, geographical origins, of the black population in Seattle when you first came?
VG: Well, of course most of them came from the East, and I don't think so many from the South until the labor dispute came up, and the Negroes were strikebreakers. Then they came in from Virginia and Arkansas or southern places where they were recruited.﻿23
MG: So that was around the Second World War period, or before that?
VG: Before the Second World War.
MG: But the early Inhabitants at the time you came were mainly from the East?
VG: Yes.
MG: What kinds of employment did the black population in Seattle have during that time?
VG: Well, it was mainly labor, that type of work. At the turn of the century, there was a newspaperman here, a man named Oxendine, and there were doctors, that's the real early days, and lawyers. And then they had several businesses here, had a delicatessen store, a general grocery store, and they had a catering business which was located on Broadway, but as far as being able to get jobs, as far as the education was qualified, they weren't able to.
MG: Do you remember any of those names of any of those business persons? We mentioned Mr. Stone and Mr. Oxendine. Do you remember any other names?
VG: Tutt and Robinson had a drugstore. Charles Adams had a tailoring shop. Now this is in the early 20th century. Why, they had hotels here. I know one of them was run by the Smiths, but I can't remember. There was another hotel. Of course, William Gross had the hotel and eating place. And there were the Cayton family. Mrs. Cayton was a descendant of Hiram Revels, and her husband, Horace Cayton, had a good job. He published a magazine, he was a publisher.
MG: His newspaper was the Seattle Republican.
VG: Yes. Later on in the 20th century, Ed Pitter, Pete De Bow, and I can't think of that name right now... They, in '26, printed this Who's Who in Seattle, and a lot of information can be gotten from that.
MG: Now for these businessmen that we had mentioned, was their clientele predominantly black or was it mixed?
VG:
MG: VG: MG:
VG:
It was mixed. Almost everything except perhaps the hotel was mixed. There was a stonemason, too, that worked on some of the buildings.
Do you remember his name?
I think it's Murray.
Now it was Mr. Pitter and—who was the other name who published the Who's Who?
Samuel P. De Bow. And let's see, Hawkins and Black, and I think there were more than that, but I...﻿24
MG: These were lawyers?
VG: Yes. And there was a transfer business with the Norris family, Isham Norris, I think his name was. X think that man's name was Murray, but I can't seem to find it.
MG: Maybe it's in one of the ads. I can find it later. Well now, for those blacks who were employed in businesses or as laborers, was there any major employer of blacks in Seattle at this time? Was there any business concern that lots of blacks worked for?
VG: Well, the one thing they used to work on the ships. That wasn't too
early, but the H. F. Alexander, the Alexander boats came up from California and employed, I think they were strikebreakers when they got on first, and then Mr. James Roston formed a sort of marine association and organized to recruit blacks to work on the boats. They got to work not only on H. F., but they got to work, they went up to Alaska.
MG: Were these fishing vessels or...
VG: No, they were for travel.
MG: Cruise ships?
VG: Yes.
MG: I see. Now was there a lot of local animosity toward these black men who were strikebreakers? And how did the black community react to any adverse criticism?
VG: Well, I guess you'd have to ask someone who is more familiar with that period than I would know. You mean animosity from the blacks?
MG: From whites toward blacks who were working as strikebreakers.
VG: Oh, yes, I think there was.
MG: How about black women, do you know how they were employed? Were there any black businesswomen?
VG:
MG: VG:
MG:
Let me think. Mrs. Graves, that was the early 1900s, she had a chiropodist business, and her daughter, and then her son finally. Her son was Dr. Giles Graves. Then there was, of course, beauty parlors, I can't think. You could probably find out in the book.
Was Mrs. Graves herself a doctor, or just her son?
I know her son was, but I'm not sure whether she was or not. It isn't in this book but it is in other books. I think so.
Okay. Well, how would you characterize the standard of living for most of the black population in Seattle at the time that you came?﻿25
VG: Well, 1 think it was very good, considering the number of people and the opportunities. They were a home-owning community., and although there were people who worked for the railroad, porters, and they made Seattle their home. They had a good social life and comfortable...
MG: I was going to ask you about that next. What was the social life like, what did it involve?
VG: It involved fraternal organizations and the Eastern Star, you know, the
women's divisions. They had the Masons and the Elks and the Odd Fellows. I don't say that's all, but that's...
MG: The primary ones?
VG: Yes.
MG: And for the women?
VG: For women, the women's division of both. We usually had a women's
division, and of course they had two main churches, the Baptist and the Methodist.
MG: What were the names of those?
VG:
MG: VG:
MG:
The First A. M. E. Church and the Mount Zion Baptist Church. Maybe somebody who has more knowledge may have some more.
MG: But these were the two main ones?
VG: Yes. And we had an early club which was called the Self-Improvement
Club, and as you can see, it was a study club as well, and they had their special social events. Then they had a professional men's club, too.
MG: Do you remember the name of that?
VG: The Arcadians. Of course, the churches were the main center in the early twenties; the YWCA and the YMCA was organized later. YMCA started as a
tennis club, and a white man here, Mr. Coleman___ They had their building
built right up there where the YMCA is now, Olive and 23rd, and they had a building there and they had tennis courts there. And the tennis club was an active social place, too. I am not as well versed as are some other people on this; this can be expanded, probably.
Now, did blacks participate in areas of public entertainment, theaters, public gatherings, or were they segregated?
Well, I understood that they were segregated as far as theaters was concerned, and then some ice cream parlors and eating places, I think, were not integrated.
What was the condition in the schools, where did black children attend schools?﻿26
VG; They attended any school wherever they were. There were not enough for the white people to become nervous about. I think the first black to graduate from Broadway High School was named Gertrude Harvey. I think she was the first...
MG: Black graduate, high school graduate?
VG: Yes.
MG: Was there an opportunity for black students to continue in higher education as well?
VG: I think in a way, but not collectively. Most of them; there was quite
a number, considering. There was a man named Richardson, I don't remember his first name, he graduated from the University of Washington in the early days. Of course, I remember hearing, when I came here in 1924, I think there were about twelve students at the University of Washington then who were black. They were not encouraged to participate in sports.
MG: What was the nature of politics among blacks during that time?
VG: I think they started to be quite active. Of	course, the strongest group,
the Republican club was the strongest, and I	think if you do Mrs. Thomas,
Constance Pitter Thomas, why, her father was	active in politics and they had quite an active club at that time.
MG: Were there any blacks elected to local or state office?
VG: Well, I'm not too sure of that. As I mentioned, Mr. Cayton was the deputy sheriff, I think. I think there must've been more than I can think of now. John T. Gayton was appointed to the District Court as the bailiff, and later on as a law librarian at U. S. District Court. He held the job until he was in his eighties, when he died. He was never replaced with a black man.
MG: How did the black population in Seattle grow? When did it begin to grow in size and how did that change conditions?
VG: After the Second World War, you know the military and the shipyards began to bring in labor, that's when. Although they had one or two camps and forts here, I mean the military... in Spokane it's called Fort George Wright, and it was for black soldiers. I don't know if they had one here, since I've been here, all I know is Fort Lewison, and that's all that's always been mixed as far as...I'm not sure.
MG: But only black soldiers were stationed at Fort George Wright in Spokane? I see.
VG: I think... I'm not sure about that.
MG: The Second World War is what brought the great influx of blacks into...﻿27
VG: Yes.
MG: Now did that change the general situation for the black population in Seattle or not? Did it decrease the level of white acceptance or what happened?
VG: Well, I think it brought an awareness to the black people that they would have to fight to get their rights of employment, and then how the military handled the black people...
MG:	Were there any civil rights organizations up until this time?
VG:	NAACP, I guess, I don't know what...
MG:	When they came in...
VG:	When they came in,
MG:	And how about the Urban League, do you know when they started?
VG: I can't remember, I'm not sure if the Urban League was here then. It was soon after I came.
MG: That it started?
VG: Yes. The NAACP, I don't know the starting dates of that.
MG: What was the nature of race relations between whites and blacks when you first came to Seattle, and did you see it change in any way?
VG: Through the years of course it's changed, because there wasn't too much mingling, although in some neighborhoods, why, they grew up together, played together like that, but I don't remember much social... Of course, they had men employed at the United States Post Office, but that was so few. The blacks had to get busy on that to be sure that they would get more of our people hired. Of course, that's one change that came about, I think, in the Second World War. When the men were all gone to fight, why, they needed all the help they could get; I think we began to increase the number of blacks.
MG: One of the striking features today of the racial situation in Seattle is the great amount of racial intermarriage. Was that characteristic of the earlier period, the twenties and thirties as well?
VG: No, I don't think it was. As I remember, there were two or three instances where white and black people married, but it was not very prevalent.
MG: So that's a rather recent phenomenon, then?
VG: Yes, I believe Seattle now has a larger percentage than most places.
MG: Than anyplace else in the country?﻿28
VG: Mr. Gross's family still has a grandson living, William Dixon, and you could get a lot of information from him,
MG: About how old a man is Mr. Dixon?
VG: He's in his eighties, and Constance Pitter Thomas, her father was very
active in the community. He came from the West Indies and married here. They printed this book—Who's Who in the State of Washington, by Pitter and De Bow. 1 don't know whether they had a newspaper, I forget that, but let's see what other name... The Norris family were here and Isham Norris, I think his name was. He had a transfer and cartage business. An early lawyer, his name was Andrew Black, and he had two children, and now he has just one granddaughter, and she has four children.
MG: What is her name?
VG: Richardson, Candace Richardson.
MG: Well, I knew Candace Black, so that was...wife or daughter?
VG: There was a Candace Black. That was Andrew Black's daughter.
MG: I see. And it's her daughter who's Candace Richardson.
VG: Letta King, she's been a music teacher, quite active in the community.
MG: Letta King.
VG: Yes, she could tell you a lot, too. They came over from Yakima. Mrs.
Vivian Spearman's family came from the South. Of course, they have three daughters and a son who's still here.
MG: They came very early?
VG: About 1904, I think. Vivian Austin Spearman. Constance and I were trying to collect history, and we still hope to see what we can do. But she has been sick, quite ill; she couldn't get around, but she's very good. There are three daughters of the Pitter family, they are all doing unusually well.
MG: Well, those are all the questions that I had prepared for you. Is there anything that we've left out that you'd like to add?
VG: Let's see, did I mention that I went to Howard University?
MG: Yes, we got that in the last session.
VG: Mrs. De Witte.. She just died not long ago. She was the first black
teacher in Seattle. Of course you are going to talk about the Cragwell descendants...
MG: Yarbrough.﻿29
VG: Yarbrough. Oh yes, and Dr. Cooper, Felix Cooper. He was a dentist and was considered the leader of the community. In those days, there was usually one or two persons who were the leaders of the community and he was considered that. And Mrs. Nella Carter, she was the first black to be employed as a social worker.
MG: Now are Dr. Cooper's descendants still here?
VG: No. He had a daughter and a son, and the son went to Alaska and since he went up there...I don't think he's been back since his father's funeral... Now Joyce, I can't think of her name, but she married an African and lives in New York. She was here a couple of years ago.
MG: Well, Mrs. Gayton, I thank you very much for this interview. I've enjoyed it very much and perhaps once the tape is sent back, if you would like to add other things, then you can.
VG: Yes. You mentioned where the black people lived. Quite a number were
recruited for the coal mines up here, and they came and lived across the lake, you know, in Black Diamond and Kennydale, and then my father-in-law lived in a little place, not a settlement, called Hazelwood. There were quite a number of them that lived in this coal mine area across Lake Washington.
MG: Now was this in the 19th century, 1890s?
VG: Yes, 1890s.
MG: Thank you very much.﻿VIRGINIA GAYTON
