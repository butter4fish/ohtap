Dorothy R. Robinson:
Juanita Jewel Craft:
This is a recorded interview with Mrs. Juanita Jewel Craft of Dallas, Texas. The tape is being made to provide material for the Black Women Oral History Project which is being conducted und er the sponsorship of the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The date is January 20, 1977. The interviewer is Mrs. Dorothy R. Robinson.
Mrs. Craft, on behalf of the project, I want to thank you for lending yourself to this interview. Personally, I think it is a tremendous project and that it fills an urgent need in our nation. It isn't that black women have not made historyi it is that the history they made has not been extensively recorded and carefully preserved. Your life has been so active, your interests so varied, and your contributions so meaningful - you are a most worthy subject for interview.
To begin with, Mrs. Craft, will you tell us something about your ancestry? Go as far back as you can remember or of which you have any record.
My paternal grandmother and her family of 24 other people were brought to Texas as slaves in 1859. They were brought from Arlington County, Virginia. It was quite interesting that they went from the slave plantation in Virginia to the coast via stagecoach, and then to Galveston, Texas, by boat. From Galveston to Austin, Texas, they walked.
The first years were trying years because they had to get started. They had to find food, and the man who brought them to Texas would give them a beef and they would kill that beef and distribute it among their whole family of 25.
In 1909, he had a celebration and all of the ex-slaves and their descendants were invited. At that time, I had moved into the scene. I was a little girl, but I can remember it vividly. It was held on a creek out from Austin at which time there was plenty of food and the reunion was outstanding. This has been recorded in a newspaper. I have not been able to find the﻿2
JJC:	(cont) origin of the newspaper, where it was printed, or the name of
the newspaper, but it is in the annals of the library at LBJ Library* in Austin, Texas.
DRR:	That is very interesting. Will you continue, and also include
something about the occupations of these early ancestors as well as the extent of their education.
JJC:	It seems to me that from the records that I have examined and these
are some of the records that I was able to get from Census tracts in the County Clerk's office and the Genealogy Department at the Library here in Dallas - well, there was nothing to do then but farming. And of course, a lot of times a man would ... even a blacksmith was registered more or less as a "day laborer." The unfortunate thing is that many names have been left out. Where a man was employed, not employed, but was used as a slave, they didn't call him by name, they only said "a Negro day laborer." It's unfortunate that history did not include the names of people. Then ofttimes again, names were changed or the people were named for the families that owned them.
I was about 14 years old before I absolutely understood that my grandfather's brother, who lived a few miles from us, had a different name. The original name was Shanklin: S-H-A-N-K-L-I-N. But the family that bought my grandfather ... I guess they were too lazy to use all of the name ... called him Shanks for short. And of course, I didn't understand it and being an inquisitive youngster, I kept asking questions until I found out that they were full brothers.
Education was limited. I don't know where my grandfather learned to read. He could read printing, but he couldn't read cursive writing. He couldn't even write his name, but he would print his name. He was interested in his children getting an education though. We had many hours together and he liked to read history. When I was in high school we would - in the afternoons - we would sit and go through our history. He was interested in ancient history. Many of the events of Texas history - just a few years after Texas was accepted into the Union, the Texas Revolution at least - and he was interested.
My paternal grandfather, after slavery, bought land. It's amusing to think that he bought land for a dollar an acre. He bought about 350 acres of land. He was a cotton farmer until about 1913 when he decided to leave the farm, which was about six miles out from Austin, and move into the city. He spent a lot of time then reading and would sit out on the plaza built in front of the house. And of course it was interesting to the people who passed by to see an old man reading a newspaper.
My maternal grandparents came from Tennessee to Texas. My maternal grandmother - there were four sisters of them. One was so thoroughly mixed that she often passed for white. My grandmother was a mulatto.

JJC:	(cont) However, I only have found out just recently that my maternal
grandfather was also born in Virginia. They settled at Columbus, Texas, in Colorado County. I don't have an account of the year, that's something that I'm working on. And I have in my mind, even at this late date, going back to Washington and really searching in the Library of Congress and the archives there to get a clearer picture of really what happened.
My maternal grandmother was a strong-willed woman. If things didn't go to suit her, she would try to make them to her own thinking. She had an argument with my grandfather soon after the San Francisco fire, and she just left (Texas) and went out there and went to work, just to get away from him. I think that was a real experience, that far back, for a woman to just walk off from her husband. She came back.
My mother was the third child - a very beautiful woman. She was attractive and she was attending school at Tillotson College in Austin when she met my father and they were married. My grandparents on both sides believed in education and of course I like to allude to the situation as 'I haven't found a horse thief yet.'
My mother died when I was 16 and of course my father lived until I was 48. But our relationship was beautiful. He was one of the first students to be accepted at Prairie View* (Prairie View, Texas) after the Land Grant College was organized. He entered Prairie View in 1891 and graduated as valedictorian of his class in 1895. During his senior year he was injured playing baseball, and after that he was never a well man. However, he gave 40 years of his life to the school room, teaching kids in the State of Texas.
The amazing thing to me at his death was that there were men there on crutches who were old men who had gone to school with my father. And I said then that if he had touched the lives of a hundred kids a year, in 40 years there were 4,000 people in the State of Texas who had been students of my father. My mother taught eight years prior to her death.
I attended Prairie View. I don't know how to describe it because when I entered there it was a state normal and industrial school. During my tenure, the college department was introduced or developed at Prairie View. Later, for certain reasons, the name was changed to Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College. Then it was changed to Prairie View University. Then back to Prairie View A. and M. College. Now it bears the title of Prairie View A. and M. University. I don't like to talk about it because it was a demeaning act by the State of Texas to let that happen to the school. They did that trying to evade the fact that we didn't have an equal educational opportunity in the state.
I had only two years at Prairie View, during which time it was an industrial school. I studied sewing and millinery and some phases of business. I then went to Summer Normals where I received a teacher's
* Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical University﻿4
JCC:	(cont) certificate, a second grade teacher's certificate, and I
did teach one year. My salary was $55 a month. Even back then I had greater desires for a better salary. However, I still haven't had that salary. I've been a professional volunteer.
My educational opportunities have been varied. I like to say that I am a graduate from the "School of Experience" and the "College of Hard Knocks."
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, you have already given us some extremely interesting
material, but I'd like to ask you something else. You referred to your college training, but could you tell us a word or two about your primary or elementary school life and also your high school life? You made reference to the fact that a farm about six miles from Austin was owned by the family. Will you tell us if you lived on the farm or if you lived in the City of Austin and whether or not you had sisters and brothers.
JJC:	No, I had no sisters or brothers. I am an only child and I'm not a
spoiled brat. I had the type of mother who was going to see to that. I am proud of one statement that she used to make to me ... and that was that she wanted me to be trained in such a way that if anything happened to her, that most anybody would give me a home. She taught me how to work, how to do things for myself: sewing, cleaning house. I got up early in the mornings and worked in the garden and I did whatever there was to do around the house.
The most amazing thing was, somebody gave her a pet - a calf and she petted that calf until it was just ... a perfect nuisance. The calf would come into the house; because at that time we had no screens. And it would lay its head in her lap ... and she wouldn't let me get into her lap. I was too big in the first place. But I decided that I wanted to milk that cow. And she decided that she didn't want me to milk her. So the cow and I would have confrontations twice every day. I guess, I'll still have to ask God to forgive me for some of the things I used to do to her. My mother was a very timid woman and of course I was a big robust tomboy type. She was screaming about little things all the time and I would take over for her at an early age.
I was born at a little place called Round Rock, Texas. My father was teaching there; it's about 15 miles from Austin. He had bought our home in Austin and we spent our summers there. I've never lived on the farm, yet some of the greatest experiences that I can remember were had on my grandfather's farm. There was always activity. There were animals. The orchard ... to see the peach trees blooming. There was a water system or tank or small lake that I used to enjoy going to and throwing rocks in and watching the animals wade out in. I enjoyed the little fellows around the farm and spent a generous portion of my life trying to catch a pig. I accomplished that when I was 24 years old and I held him exactly one second. It taught me a lot about nature. I just wanted to get down to my grandparents' home - it was a beautiful place and he was very proud of it. I think in terms of how my grandmother﻿5
rJC::	(cont) worked - with the inconveniences that we talk about now -
the churning of the milk, making the butter, feeding the chickens, getting fresh eggs every day - it was a marvelous experience.
I received my elementary education under the guidance of my father. It is interesting to note that I started school when I was four years old. I used to want to follow him to school. On a particular day, after my fourth birthday, he was having a class and a boy who seemed to me now to have been about nine or ten years old was reading a sentence which said, "Will is a boy." He got hung up on the word "boy." I looked over at his book and said to him, "Why, that's boy. Are you crazy?" So my Dad said, "If you're going to teach my classes, then you're going to have to be prepared to do so." That same afternoon, I was introduced to my first primer.
I spent a lot of time reading with my then adopted brother, a boy who was given to my mother by his father after the death of his mother. But that experience was short lived. My grandmother, my mother's mother, was so afraid that my mother's love for him would surpass her love for me that she stole the boy from my mother. She took him to Houston, Texas, where he ran away from her and went to San Antonio. We never found him again during my mother's lifetime.
However, in later years, through a conversation, he found my father. I was in college at that time, and he wanted to know where I was. We've kept our relationship since. But I'm so sorry that my mother after searching for him for a number of years, without wanting to implicate her mother in the theft of a child, didn't get to see him before her death.
When I went to high school, I went to Anderson High School in Austin. The year before graduation, my mother died. I left the high school in Austin and went to Columbus to be with my father since he had begun teaching there. When my mother died I couldn't stand to be away from him. I felt that he needed me and so I came out of school. I graduated from high school in Columbus, Texas.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, thinking again of your childhood, would you say that you
had a happy childhood or would you say it was unhappy? I would also like to know something about how you considered the socio-economic level of the family in which you grew up. Would you think you were better off from that point of view than the average family in the community, the average black family, or just how would you assess that?
JJC:	My father, as I forestated, was injured playing baseball in 1895.
He was never a well man after that. He spent his time with doctors. He had surgery when I was about four or five years old - when it was just very unpopular to have surgery. The doctors merely went in to explore. He survived that operation. Then again, they later had to go back in for an appendectomy. It was interesting because it was community talk -"Did you know Dave Shanks has had an operation?" When I think of the﻿6
JJC:	(cont) progress that has been made in the field of medicine now,
maybe if he had lived a little later, he could have lived a little longer.
I consider my childhood days interesting ones because I didn't have time to get lonely. I took music at a very early age. At that time my father was teaching about 15 miles out and I would get the train and go to Austin for music lessons. I would argue with the conductor about my age and everything else because I was riding for half fare. He figured since I was a large youngster - that I must have been older.
I used to sew; my mother taught me embroidery ... to be using a needle at all times; thereby I started making my own clothing at 13. There was something to do in the garden and I wanted to help my father because of his problems. I didn't want him to do a lot of the heavy work. And there was always a challenge at my house. My father would say to me, "Oh, I bet you can't do that." I would take him up on that every time. I guess that's been a part of my life, to accept challenges wherever I find them.
In my coming up ... well, everywhere was rural then, practically, because Austin, the population was 24, 25,000 people. And of course that wouldn't make a good suburb down there now. It was interesting that the family ... we had no particular friends - but they were very careful about my whereabouts and kids that I played with and whether I was going to be a nuisance to the family and things of that sort. My mother - if I asked her if I could go over to Mary's house, for instance - she would ask me, "Have you asked your father?" And then I would go to my father, "May I go over to Mary's house?" He would immediately say, "Have you asked your mother?" I didn't go anywhere until they had gotten together and made a joint decision on whether or not I should go. I can appreciate that now because I think that there was no time in my early life that they didn't know where I was.
In the community where we lived, there were small cities, little towns, various towns. My father was teaching in various places. He never wanted to teach in a city school. In Austin, the man who was president of Prairie View when he finished there was at that time the principal of Anderson High School in Austin. My father was a very mischievous person. When I was in high school, this man often told me about some of the things that my father got into when he was at Prairie View. And oh, that did me more good than anything on earth, to get a joke on my Dad.
When I was in Prairie View, my father surprised me with a visit. And everywhere we went, there were some of the old teachers reprimanding him still and reminding him of some of the things that he was into when he was there. So I said to him, "If I get sent home for mischief, you can't say a word! Because you have really set an example for me." I've always been the jolly mischievous type of person. It's pretty difficult for me to really settle down to be sincere.
My father was a jolly person. He was a very stern looking man and was ofttimes mistaken for being angry or he was mistaken for being﻿7
JJC:	(cont) non-approachable - but he was an ill man. It seems that this
injury was to his spleen. Our house looked like a corner drugstore all of my life. So I'm saying that the money that was earned - most times it went for medicine. That happened all of his life.
My mother, as I forestated, died when I was 16. We found four months prior to her death that she was tubercular. And the doctor said, "We'll have to get her into a dry climate." There was a sanatorium at San Angelo, Texas, but no Negroes were accepted there or permitted to use the facilities even though it was a state institution. I took my mother to San Angelo and rented a tent and lived with her in it for two months. It started raining out there and that was what the doctors didn't want. When it rained, she lost all hope of getting well. And she wanted to go to my father. I took her to my father and she lived nine days after that. When we walked into the house, she said, "I was born in this house and I came back to die." I reprimanded her, "How could you say that when we're trying to help you live? And you are here talking about dying." But she understood. I didn't.
Soon after her death, my father carried me to the doctor to have me examined thoroughly to see if I had any trace of tuberculosis and of course I came out with flying colors. I was young, but that was another challenge for me. I took care of my mother. At that time, we weren't using the sophisticated antiseptics that we're using now. We only used carbolic acid. Everything that she touched had to be sterilized, and the papers had to be burned, her bed had to be changed daily. I never stopped with her bedding in the house, I kept out to an old-fashioned wash pot, made a fire out there and boiled everything that she used. Her dishes had to be boiled. I took care of her.
When I look at young people now, who are so helpless, who have been brought up not knowing how to do things, not knowing how to follow orders, anything of that sort, I'm disturbed.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, I think you've made reference to a lot of aspects of your
early life but I don't think we have yet really determined the date of your birth. You mentioned the place but not the date. I wish you would give us this information. At the same time, tell us, aside from your parents and your grandfather, other persons or events that might have influenced your life during your childhood and also persons and or events that influenced your public life as an adult. Just what persons or what occasions made you the Juanita Jewel Craft that you are? Why are you so involved in so many things, and how did it happen that you developed that kind of interest as you matured?
JJC:	I would give credit to my father for the influence that he had on
my life. There was a bit of sympathy there that I have always had for him. The fact that he wasn't a well man; he would walk a few feet and sit down, ofttimes with me carrying a chair for him. I have seen him in the schoolroom, most times seated, but he never gave up. We spent a lot of time together; a lot of time reading. And of course we had newspapers in our home even back there when it was very unpopular among our people.﻿8
JJC:	My mother and my father both were people who wanted the best for me.
They exposed me to events and so forth. When I was a little girl, Teddy Roosevelt, who was at that time the President of the United States, came to Austin. They had been preparing me for this visit for a long time it seems now. All I could hear - the President was coming. "We're going to see the President" - and we did. But they forgot to tell me what the President was. And when the phaeton was driving down Congress Avenue, the streets were lined with people everywhere and she was trying to point out to me, my mother was. "Do you see, Juanita? There he is! There's the President!" "Where, Mama?" "Don't you see the man with the high silk hat, waving to everyone?" And I fell right out in the streets. I thought I was going to see some kind of wild animal. Sometimes 1 think 1 did.
But it is amazing to me now that that inspiration - going to see Teddy Roosevelt at that point - having been with Jimmy Carter recently, I've seen nine Presidents of the United States. And that's what I say to young people when they criticize me for continuing to work in the community at my age. I usually say to them, out of the clear blue sky, "I've seen seven Presidents, I've seen eight Presidents, how many have you seen?" And to say that to a 30-year-old is to me a big bash.
DRR:	You made some reference to your age, but you didn't tell us what your
age is. Would you tell us when you were born?
JJC:	This is amazing because that's what I usually spend most of my time
talking about. I am so thankful to God that He has let me live - in the next three weeks I will be 75 years old. I was born, February 9, 1902. I have not ever seen a time that I wasn't proud of that birthday. I usually start talking about it weeks beforehand. I don t like gifts, I don't want people to give me gifts because they never give me the things that I want, the things that I need, or the things that I would appreciate. So I just want to thank God that He gave me a mother who went through the pangs of childbirth and gave me a healthy life.
I have had no problems health-wise. I've had very few sick days in my life and they were short-lived. I know that the time is running out but I'm not going to be anywhere sitting waiting for death. Death is going to have to catch up with me.
DRR;	A very beautiful statement, Mrs. Craft, and a very courageous one.
You know, many people might look at you and decide that you had two very strong barriers - you are female and you are black. Would you respond to that? Do you feel that being female and/or black has provided barriers or constrictions for you? Just how do you view that situation
JJC:	I've heard the statement a little different from that. I am female, I'm
a woman, I have age, and of course, the proverbial black. I don't consider myself a black. If you're going to use black as a noun, what is a black? I'm very much concerned about the term. You can't be talking about my color, because the shoes I'm wearing are black. I have been told by young people, "You've got to think black." I don't
?﻿9
JJC:	(cont) know how to think a color. So I guess I can ostracize myself
into a category that I've been proud of. I am an American citizen. I happen to be of a darker hue than some other Americans. I don't believe in segregation. And I refuse to segregate myself because that's the only way I can say to the other fellow, "Don't you segregate me."
I lived under segregation for a number of years. I was not happy there, because I saw the barriers that had been placed in front of me. I defy anybody to tell me that I can't think because I am a female. I defy anybody to say that I can't think because of my age. I'm proud of my age and I have said to people ofttimes, "Don't criticize me because God has blessed me with age." I think that I have been left here to do something for somebody. And I think that I'm going to be about that chore. I have them all laughing that you will never put me in a corner anywhere. I would build myself a round room first; so that there would be no corners.
As I said earlier in this interview, I've always accepted challenges. I want to say that I've accomplished something. I accepted the challenge of fighting for the rights of my people. I have been quite a student of the Constitution of this country, and my belief is there. How can a person tell me that this Constitution provides for all people, equal opportunities, and then deny me the privilege of preparing for these opportunities. So I have been in the struggle for a long time: the right to vote, the right to serve on a jury, the right to everything in this country that every other American has. I don't see why I should be denied these rights just because of the color of my skin.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, you have mentioned challenges and how you have always tried
to meet them, what would you consider your most important achievement in life as you have met the various challenges?
JJC:	I think that the contributions that I have made in the civil rights
struggle are most meaningful. I think to try to lift the feeling of dignity in the minds of young people has been one of my most interesting and most dedicated feelings. I have thought of future generations and I've thought of the past. I don't think that a person has to live in the past all the time, but you've got to build on the past. Rights that I did not have: the right to a drink of water with dignity; the right to a first class ride on a train; the right to eat a meal in a restaurant; the right to rest-room facilities in this country, I could not conceive of this country enduring under those circumstances.
I was very much disturbed when after World War II there was a group of German prisoners-of-war that were brought to the State of Texas in a first-class environment - eating in the restaurant in the train stations. But there were some Negro soldiers who had been wounded, who were not able to get food in that same environment.
I was concerned about young people. I wanted to teach them that the Constitution of this country had provided for them these rights and, "Let's get out here and fight for them." The Constitution provides﻿10
IJC:	(cont) courts for us. The only thing that I'm disturbed about is the
kind of people that we have in these positions who could look with dignity on the lives of other people. I have watched politicians take the oath of office and when they declare that "I will uphold the Constitution" and then go back into a segregated environment, it has disturbed me.
I think that the right to a first class education has been the basis of a lot of my activities. I was involved in the opening of North Texas University. I took the first student there and helped him try to make application. I organized a group of youth on the University of Texas campus who helped us through their contacts at the university to file the suit. They helped us raise money; they helped us picket; and they helped us in many ways to win that suit which was won in 1950. The case was Sweatt vs. Painter.
I don't know what to say about the many awards that I have received and so forth ... all of them are precious to me because all of them have had ... a little something that was indeed outstanding. It would be hard for me to say which one was most important or which activity has been most important. In 1938 when we were fighting for the right to serve on a jury in Dallas, Texas, a man by the name of G. F. Porter who answered a summons was thrown from the courthouse. His head struck the pavement; he became blind and walked the streets of Dallas blind for eleven years prior to his death. I said to everybody, "When you receive a summons - go and serve, the price has been paid." And, "All you have to do is go down there now with the dignity of a citizen and serve on juries." I want these rights and I accept the responsibilities .
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, you have mentioned at some length your involvement in the
civil rights struggle. I know you've worked through many organizations and I think there have been some projects that I've read about that you more or less created yourself. I wonder if you would name for us other organizations, I know you can't name them all, through which you've worked.
In glancing through your scrapbooks, I noticed that you've also been a delegate to various national meetings. I think I see a picture here of you and the late President Kennedy, and also an invitation that you received to a White House Conference during the Richard Nixon administration. I wonder if you would expand on that for us. I think it would be tremendously important.
JJC:	I received my first invitation to Washington from President Kennedy to
attend the 100th Anniversary of the Signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, February 12th, 1963. I attended that conference with more than 1,100 other persons from all over the country.
Later that same year, in July, it was July 9th to be exact, 1963, I received another invitation to come to Washington with 300 ladies from all over the country. President Kennedy at that time wanted to talk﻿11
JJC-	(cont) about the civil rights struggle. He wanted to talk about
school drop-outs. And of course, having had a captive group with my Youth Council (NAACP Youth Council), I came back to Dallas and we instituted a campaign against school drop-outs. We were able to acquire some resources in the form of cardboard stock and so forth. We set up in my backyard, a silk-screen process of printing and we printed and distributed in the City of Dallas more than 25,000 placards and bumper stickers. Each slogan was something relating to preparation. For instance, one slogan said, "Learn and Earn." Another slogan said, "Knock Out School Drop-Outs."
It was interesting for the kids, 14 and 15 years old, to learn the process of silk-screen printing. We placed these placards in schools and churches all over the City of Dallas. We did a whole group of them in Spanish so as to be used in the Spanish-speaking areas. That was in 1963. And I still see in many parts of the City, some of those placards and some of those signs saying: "Stay in School," "Knock Out School Drop-Outs."
I have worked with numerous organizations in the City of Dallas. But let me continue another project that my youth have been involved in. We were involved in the sit-in demonstrations back in 1960, 1961, and 1962. We had been involved in the City of Dallas, at the Fair Park, in 1955, in picketing the State Fair of Texas because they only let our youth go one day a year. We were concerned because we felt we were citizens and certainly we should have access to the park facilities and so forth every day. We got national recognition and we were awarded in San Francisco, in 1956, for our activity.
In 1961 we started working on the theaters and the lunch counters, at which time we picketed, we stood-in at the theaters. You know it got to be quite interesting, the way we performed. A youth would walk up to the window at the theater and ask for an admission ticket. And when that youth was denied, without any further conversation he would walk back to the end of the line and go right through it again. There was a complete circle of students from S.M.U.* and other areas around Dallas who joined us in our protest.
The thing that worried me was a lot of older people could not see our needs or did not join us. I've had friends to say, "I came down to see the line." I would immediately ask them, "Did you bring a bottle of coke? Or did you bring a sandwich to one of those kids?" I have seen those kids so dedicated to breaking the chain that was binding them that they would walk until their shoes became unbearable, and they would continue to walk until they'd worn out the feet of their hose.
I was involved from a national standpoint in St. Paul, Minnesota, that same year, 1960. There I saw the youth of the nation - many of them who are now holding prominent positions in this country as ministers, as legislators, as people of stature - crying because they had won a victory. I shall never forget when Walgreen's in Arlington, Virginia,
* Southern Methodist University﻿12
JJC:	(cont) broke through and said, "We will serve you." The kids at
Howard University that had been involved were so happy because they had really suffered when ... while seated at the counters, the owners would decide to wash the shelves off - not by brushing a rag but just throwing the water, hot water, up on the shelves and of course some of it would fall on the students. They put burnt matches down their backs but they sat there. This is why the right to use the facilities, public accommodations which everybody else uses in this country, has been meaningful to many of us.
In Dallas we used a little different technique on our restaurants. It was amazing how we figured those things out. Our attorney said to us that the store owner has a contract with the public to use these facilities. Unless they said, in writing, no Negroes allowed, you have a right to go in there and be served. Our kids would buy a big bag of some sort of drawing paper or something that would be noticeable, then go in to the lunch counter and ask for a ten-cent coke. Most of the waitresses would become frantic and didn't know what to do. But they would say, "I can't serve you." And of course the kids would say, "Well, I bought this at another counter, why can't I be served at this counter?" You could spend money anywhere in the store except at a lunch counter. Then they would ask to see the manager. And this was a right that our attorneys had taught us; we have a right, if we are refused, to talk to the manager. But all the time, when this young person was talking to the manager, there would be two others outside waiting to come in and repeat the same gesture. Also, on telephones at home, various youth were calling to talk to the manager. And all they wanted to know was, "What is your policy toward serving me at the lunch counter?"
These protest movements grew all over the country. The first one started at Oklahoma City, at Katz Drugstore in 1958. And that same summer, 1958, a group started at Wichita, Kansas. But it was only in 1960 that it caught fire all over the country when the college students realized for the first time that when youth had been denied, all of us had been denied. I never shall forget in talking to a person, a Caucasian person in our neighborhood, and she said, "I never thought about where a Negro ate." I think that we brought to the people of this country the fact that we had been denied.
I worked with a group of Jewish kids at Sherith, Israel, on this thing of public accommodations and one young man stood up, he was about 15 years old, and he said, "I think that I have a right to serve whom I choose," And I asked this young man if he had food for sale, if it mattered to whom he served? Then I asked him a second question, I asked him, "Have you ever been hungry?" I said, "If you were hungry and had money in your pocket to buy food and then somebody denied you that right, how would you feel?" And I also said to him that Khrushchev - who at that time wasn't too well accepted in this country - had visited here and had been given the red carpet treatment, but I couldn't get that same treatment.﻿13
(cont) I worked with the Urban League. The Urban League is about two years younger than the N.A.A.C.P. They have fought in the field of housing and job opportunities. Here in Dallas we had a period of strife in the field of housing. When a Negro moved into a neighborhood the house was bombed or burned. That period lasted from 1945 to 1951. I never could understand why the Police Department of the City of Dallas could not have been more involved than it was. But, finally, a young woman who was a widow was standing on her back porch and saw a bomb coming over the fence into her yard. She had a gun nearby. She used the gun and fired toward the source from which it (the bomb) came. It was amusing because immediately after that the Police Department arrived and one policeman ran for cover, as I would have, the other one dived on the bomb and yelled, "Get me some water!" The woman ran in her house and got a bucket and ran water from her faucet in the kitchen and carried it back to the officer. Afterwards they realized that the bomb had fallen two feet from a fish pond that was filled with water.
These kinds of experiences made me know that there was a lot to be done. How could you convince America that America should sell me a ten-cent coke or should let me eat when I became hungry; why did I have to go to the back door to get food? This became an issue with me, and I have followed through ever since, I don't like discrimination because of color, or because of my condition. The only thing that I say that is important to me is an opportunity.
Mrs. Craft, you have made frequent references in your last statements about the kids, or your youth, or the youngsters. With what organization were these youngsters identified? I think you referred to them with reference to a meeting some place in Minnesota and I believe also in San Francisco. Would you identify that organization for us please?
The organization the kids were involved in was the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the N.A.A.C.P. I have worked with the youth department since 1964. I have attended all of the conventions of the N.A.A.C.P. since 1944, I think it is in the thirties now. For a number of years, I have carried bus loads of kids to the national convention. I have carried over a thousand youngsters on trips from Los Angeles to Boston. I wanted them to see some of the country that they had been asked to die for. I wanted them to see its natural beauty.
I've carried kids to the Grand Canyon, to Carlsbad Caverns, to the Painted Desert, to the Petrified Forest. I've carried them to the Pacific Ocean. I have shown them colleges and universities everywhere we have gone. I have carried five bus loads of kids to Washington, D.C. Also to Boston ... I wanted them to see the Plymouth Rock, where the country really started. I've carried them to Niagara Falls and to the Smoky Mountains. In fact, we have had a real good relationship. Last year my youth president in Memphis, Tennesee, became Mr. N.A.A.C.P., the most outstanding black youth in the entire nation.
Here in Dallas, we started another program. In 1969 I was concerned﻿14
JJC:	(cont) about the litter and the ecology of this city and I convinced
the kids that we should do something about it. We decided to build a can pile. So we named our program, the Kid's Kan Kampaign. We spelled it with K's instead of C's and we created quite a bit of interest because they hadn't thought of it like that. The newspapers carried it, "Woman here organizes KKK."
The first effort was done in West Dallas. We decided to build a can pile in a park. We invited the Fire Department to come out and bring some units and to work with the kids that day. For three days, the kids were picking up that trash, bottles and cans and that morning ... on a Saturday morning, they were to bring them to make the pile. This was fascinating to me because by 7:30 that morning, there was a stream of cars about two blocks long with the parents who were helping their kids to bring their findings to the location. At the end of the effort, the City of Dallas had to move from our can pile 16 city truck-loads of cans and bottles. The thing that was interesting about it was that since that time, a new organization has been formed called the ABCD Committee: "A Beautiful Clean Dallas." But it grew out of our effort. We are still active with the ABCD Committee, but we have given up the leadership - it is much bigger than we are.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, may I back up a moment to get a statement for clarification.
I think earlier you made mention of taking the first students to North Texas State University and I am supposing you meant the first black students. I am going to ask you to respond to that please. Also, please tell us if you are a member of any sorority or if you have any comment in that regard.
JJC:	It was July the 13th, 1955,that I carried a student by the name of Joe
L. Atkins to North Texas (State University), a student from this community who happens to be of color, to make application for entry there. We talked to the president and the vice-president of the school for several minutes, trying to make them say that Joe was not being accepted because of his race and they just would not say it. But the next week, they wrote the most beautiful letter that we have ever received, saying to this young man that we are not accepting you because of your race. That was July the 13th, 1955. In August, we filed a suit and the decision came down December the 17th, 1955. The decision came too late for this young man to enter school. Texas Western opened its doors for him and he is a graduate of Texas Western (University) at El Paso, Texas.
Then the amazing thing was, when he came home with a degree, he couldn't get a job. It was embarrassing to him when he went to a desk down at the court house and before he could tell the woman anything about his credentials ... when he asked for personnel, she said, "The janitorial department is downstairs." He wasn't looking for janitorial work. He then answered an advertisement for employment at a dress company. He knew nothing about cutting materials and that was the only department in which they had a vacancy. Then, it was so disgusting. Everyone would say to him, why don't you go into the school system, you ought to go to Dr. White - who was the superintendent of schools at that time. He got so disgusted that he volunteered in the service and did﻿15
jjC:	(cont) two years in the military. He came back and started looking
for a job again and it was always the same thing, "We have nothing today, but you ought to go to the school system." Finally, he went to the school system. He taught for a few years and now he is employed by the Classroom Teachers Association of Dallas and he is working now trying to better situations for the teachers.
No, I do not belong to any sorority. When I was in Prairie View (A. and M. University) the only organizations on the campus were the Y.W.C.A. and the Y.M.C.A. I find that sororities have not helped those too well in the community who need help. It seems that they are a little stiff, they never seem to get involved, they isolate themselves from most of the programs and I don't understand what benefits come from being a soror, other than the jamborees and the good times that they promote. But as far as the community is concerned, it is difficult to get them to serve on committees and so forth that would be helpful for all the people. Many of our young people in colleges are pledging to sororities and if this is what they choose to do, I am for them. However, I have known of so many who have said later that they regret that they went into a sorority.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, you have told us a great deal about your involvement with
various human improvement activities and the organizations with which you have been identified and certainly the workman is worthy of his hire and occasionally, a prophet receives some honor in his own country. As I sat here in your living room, I have counted some 45 awards and plaques and I know very well that some of your material is already housed in the librar^ and you tell me that there are still other awards that are not on display. Would you make some comment about those? I don't know that I have ever seen a private citizen with so many awards. Would you react please?
JJC:	My first award came in 1955 when I presented to the N.A.A.C.P. a check
for $3,078.38. My father was a poor man. He felt that he could not be with me physically, and he wanted to do something, so he left in his will a share of a piece of property to be given to the N.A.A.C.P.
I, at that time, had no dreams that my walls would ever look like they do now. I had a visitor one day and she said, "This is what you call living walls. Your life is on these walls." And of course, I thought about the dresser drawers and the cabinet drawers around here that could have been included in that statement.
I received an outstanding award in 1969 which is called the Linz Award. It is fostered by the Linz Jewelry Company and the Dallas Times Herald. It grew out of my participation in a fight against fraudulent trade schools in Dallas. I received an anonymous telephone call telling me that there were some youth who were being mistreated in a certain area of the City and I fell for it as usual. I called the number that was left for me and the woman said, "I'll get one of the young ladies to talk to you." When the young lady started explaining to me what her problem was, I was so dense about such an operation, I said, "Get a cab and you and the other three girls who are involved,
* Dallas Public Library﻿16
JJC:	(cont) come to my house." They did, and within minutes after they
were here and explained to me what had happened to them, I carried them down to the district attorney's office. I was really disturbed when they told me there that there wasn't a law in the State of Texas that would protect them. Well, I said, "If we don't have a law, we're going to get some laws, because this is ridiculous."
Recruiters had gone out through East Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas and showed these young people pictures of huge housing complexes, showing swimming pools and televisions in every room. Just the idea of these youngsters being invited to come to Dallas to go to school and they had portrayed this as being the campus. And they were appealing to the poorer classes, where families had to mortgage cattle in some areas to pay the down payment of $50 - I found out later that that went to the recruiter. They had promised these young people that they would give them secretarial training and business training and that they would have a job for them when they got here so that they could maintain themselves. When they got here, there were no jobs. They had obtained some vacant apartment buildings and that is where the dormitories were set up - no swimming pool, no television, no anything.
I got with these girls and went back to this location with them and when I walked in the room of one girl, there was a bed only in there, no mirror, no dresser, nothing. The bathroom which was intended to accommodate several girls had raw sewage coming up in the bathtub. I went with these girls through the line where they were serving food. I heard the woman in charge of the kitchen say, "I am sorry, but all of the food is gone." They put a fence around this place to keep out the visiting men and boys that frequented the place in the afternoons, and I knew what was going to happen.
Number one, the kids were not being fed. The next day, I fed 20 here at my house. The next day, the number grew to 33. The following day it grew to 44 and on that Saturday, I served 63 kids here at my house. By that time, I had contacted friends, the League of Women Voters and others who brought food so we at least could keep the girls from being hungry. They were kids, top flight in their classes in the areas from which they came. Nice clean, innocent little girls who had been used and taken advantage of. I even went to visit some of the families. I went as far as Vicksburg, Mississippi, and when I saw the house that this young woman had come from and saw the situation, it made me sick.
Well, each year,that was in 1967 and 1968, there was a stream of them coming in that fall. Recruiters would collect that first payment. They had no jobs for the girls. They would hand them the newspapers the want-ad section - when the youth did not even know one street from another. People were calling me everywhere because I was outspoken and vocal about it. I had gone to the television stations, the radio stations and the news media. The newspapers gave me very little support.﻿17
JJC:	(cont) In 1968, I found a group of boys standing out on the street
corner talking and as I drove up, I asked them if they were satisfied with their location and their situation and they said, "No, ma'am." From that confrontation with those boys I was able to get them to air their complaints to Legal Services and we then started an investigation.
The person who made the investigation was amazed. I went to some churches in the community. I saw that the kids got to church on Sunday mornings. Then I went to several of the churches where there were lawyers who were members of the church and people who had a heart and they worked with me beautifully, trying to give some advice and help. I became pretty well incensed when the minister of a church, who was the pastor of one of the lawyers, came to my house and they tried to talk me out of continuing to pursue this situation. The lawyer said that he was giving some in-kind services to the organization, but that he didn't see anything wrong with it. So I told him, that for every girl that got pregnant out of that group, that I would consider him as the guilty one. It kind of shook him up a little bit, so he took a little different stand, but I haven't heard from him since.
I reported to a committee from the legislative area on two or three occasions, and we were able after four years of work and worry, to get a law passed in the State of Texas that closed up a lot of these schools. There's a little bit of relief now, but every now and then we run into one of them still. The thing that is most interesting about this whole situation is that they had told the students that it would be so easy, they would be employed afterwards and they made it very bright for them. They are still harassing the students in our high schools.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, the fact that you have commented at length on the reason
for your receiving the Linz Award, lets me know how you prize it and after listening to that, I can very well understand why you would prize it so. But glancing at the many, many plaques and awards, I can easily discern that they come from all levels, local, state and national. Indeed, it is quite a display and certainly we would not be able to go into detail about each one.
I've been sitting here wondering what your hobbies are and you have mentioned travel as you have supervised your youth N.A.A.C.P. groups on various trips. Have you done any traveling on your own? Have you had any yen to do so? Would you comment on that please?
JJC:	I am almost a fanatic about traveling. I'll go almost from here to
Forney ... which is 12 or 13 miles away, just to be moving. I am a lover of nature, and I have carried these kids on trips where I had been. I wanted them to see them. Just at Christmas time this past year, I went to San Antonio and down to Corpus Christi at which time I took my little seven-year-old namesake. It was a joy for me to see a little child just screaming with glee because she's at last seen﻿18
JJC:	(cont) an ocean and she wanted to be sure so she yelled, "Craft, is
this the ocean?" She liked to pick up shells.
You can see that I am a rock-hound. I have been picking up rocks all of my life. This shelf portrays rocks from all over the country, from many of my travels. I sort of got slow about it after I was flying because of the weight in bringing them back.
I am interested in the State of New Mexico because of the Indian situation there. You know, until 1970, I had been a very selfish person. I was concerned about the plight of m£ people and I had not realized really fully the plight of the Indians before 1965. I first went to the State of New Mexico on a visit ... and visiting the Indian schools and seeing them still living in hogans and living almost like animals, seeing whole families being raised in one room, I was concerned. And yet, millions of dollars were being spent to provide these schools. But to see them catch a child and have to delouse that child to bring him to the school ... I don't think that I had had that kind of suffering.
In 1970, I was a delegate to the White House Conference on Children which met in Washington, D.C. There were more than 4,000 delegates and they were there from all of the possessions of the United States - Puerto Rico, and as far away as Guam - and to have heard the pleas and the cries of the Japanese-Americans, the Indian-Americans, the Mexican-Americans ... all pleading for the same thing; that is, recognition in this country. I talked to Indians from Alaska. It just seems impossible that this thing in 1970 had continued and there I was in the company of a Japanese psychiatrist who was talking about the Walter McCarran Act that was just lifted last year that these people, American citizens, were now free in this country. The Indian situation is not as good, but I am keenly interested in those people. I have worked here in Dallas with an Indian group that has been transported into this city. They have been given training opportunities and they are improving, but many of them, many of them, are not content with what they are exposed to.
Mexican-Americans, Mexican youth who were born in this country, whose heritage is this country, are not accepted. At the City Council of which I am a member at this time, we have not a single Mexican down there in a policy-making position. I am concerned because I think that they should have representation. If taxation without representation was important in the founding of this country, it is important now. I had a woman say to me one day that, "I think these Mexicans should go back to Mexico where they came from." Immediately I said to her, "This is Mexico - this part of Mexico has been sold to us.^ These people have a right here,just like every other ethnic group. It's amazing to me that this country is a melting pot, made up of people from all over the world - of lands all over the world - and yet they would want to deny those of color, their rights and privileges.﻿19
Mrs. Craft, having known you as long as I have, I know that you have done considerable travel, some of which you have not mentioned and again, I want to come back, do you have some hobby that you would like to mention other than travel? Would you tell us some of the countries or places that you have visited and tell us about any hobbies other than working with people?
One of my hobbies has been the love of nature and I am a rockhound. I'll pick up a rock anywhere on earth where I see one that impresses me. In traveling, there is hardly a place that I have been that I don't have a rock. For instance, from the Narragansett Bay — I picked up a rock that appealed to me. I have a volcanic rock. I have rock from Kit Carson's cave, I have shells and rocks from Jekyl Island, Georgia. That was really an experience because I would get up early in the mornings and go out on the beach before anybody picked up the shells or before any had disappeared, I was wondering how I was going to get them back here.
I have a piece of wood that was fascinating to me because it was covered with barnacles on two sides. It was a piece of a two-by-four and the other two sides were smooth. I took it into a motel room and put it in the basin and covered it with water to wash the sand out while I went out to dinner. When I came back and turned the light on, there must have been 500 worms sticking out of the end of that thing. It frightened me to death. I knew they were harmless, but the shock of seeing that worm-eaten piece of wood ... But I have it. I brought it back. I changed the temperature of the water a little bit and settled that problem. But I found a plastic bucket down on the beach and I started picking up sand dollars and shells of different sizes and different species, seaweed of different species and things of that sort.
I like to call myself a junk collector. I once had an exhibit and the exhibit was made out of things that you normally throw away. I like to say that I preserve things for posterity, just keep them, you don't throw things away all of the time. But in collecting at that time, it was interesting because, I took little cans and I made napkin rings out of them. I did a lot of soap carving at that time. I've had some crazy hobbies. I've always wanted to do something that no one else wanted to do. I made shell jewelry. Oh, I used to sell shell jewelry, necklaces and bracelets and earrings and things of that sort. And of course, my latest hobby has been making box purses. Of course, I have tried to interest some of my friends my age to join me and they start hollering, I am too nervous, I can't do this, I can't do the other.
I learned the purse trade by working with a group at the North Way Christian Church, a white church in this community and of course, I've had several years now with them. They have this bazzar once a year that brings them from $18,000 to $22,000 in one day and I've enjoyed working with them. I've done ceramics; I've done a lot of types of art.﻿20
JJC:	(cont) And in fact ... I said earlier in this interview that I'd
never had a meaningful job that paid a salary, but I've always made a living out of fads. One time, I made aprons ... little party aprons. I sold them for $8 and $10. They weren't anything but the work that I put in on them. I say, it is another challenge that I can live without having a lot of money. Since I've been on the City Council this last year, I've been paid $50 a week - but I was living before I had the $50. I have a Social Security check from my husband. I never worked under Social Security.
DRR:	Thank you, Mrs. Craft. As you were speaking just a moment ago, I was
thumbing through some more material here and of course, it would take me weeks to digest what's here, but I do see a picture of you in a group and Lyndon Johnson is there and I think that I've heard you say at one time, that you have personally met some five or six Presidents of the United States. Perhaps you will comment on that and certainly give us some information about your contact with the late President Johnson.
JJC:	Yes, I have had several experiences with Johnson, first as a Senator. You
know, he got to the Congress, by those 87 votes as a Senator. I went there to talk to him about our civil rights movement and I couldn't find the young man. His brother talked to us and of course, he said to us, "I think my brother would want you to do this," which was different .
In 1966, I received a presidential invitation from President Johnson at which time the subject was, "To Secure These Rights." He had made that famous talk at Howard University. At that meeting, there were 2,600 persons, all trying to work out the problems that existed in this country and he was working on the Voters' Rights Act at that time.
My next to the last appearance with President Johnson was December 11th, I've forgotten the year, the year that he died ... at the LBJ Library in Austin. A group of us met him there. That's when he presented the Civil Rights Papers. Chief Justice Warren was there and people who had been involved in the civil rights struggle all these years were there. That was when he made his last public address. I received the invitation and left Dallas on a Sunday afternoon enroute to Austin in a car. It was another such day as we had recently with ice everywhere, and we had to turn around and come back. I then went to the bus station at 4:30 in the afternoon and left for Austin, 200 miles away. We got to Temple, Texas, 55 miles from Austin and we could go no farther. Believe it or not, we stayed in Temple two days and I got there (to Austin) just at the time that he was completing his address.
January the next year - and I don't have that date in mind - at the inauguration of Governor Dolph Briscoe, L.B.J, was there. He sat on the platform and he died five days later.
DDR:	Mrs. Craft, there are several issues and concerns of current interest
that are taking up the thinking and dialogue among American people and one is the women's movement. I wish you would share your views of the women's movement with us. Also, you might tell us whether or not religion has had a very profound influence on your life.﻿21
JJC:	I was brought up in the Christian church, in a Christian environ-
ment. However, I guess I have become a little bit confused and frustrated as I have grown older. At that time, nobody told me that there was other than the Christian religion and what the real meaning of a religion was. I am still a member of a Christian church, a Baptist church, but I think that we need to do a study as to the real meaning of Christianity. The things that Christianity holds, the things that I think we should be most interested in, we aren't.
I go to my church and listen to a minister and it is almost like going to get a drink of water. After you get that drink of water, you don't just sit there and sit there and sit there, you get up and go and do the things that you are about. I have been criticized by some of my fellow church members because when I leave the church, I go into the community. To me, this is one of the best ways to portray the life of Jesus Christ on earth. He was always found with the people, administering to the sick, the blind, the lame, the hurt.
And of course, to me now, most of our churches have gotten to be social affairs where we go and meet our friends and discuss what kind of dress a certain sister was wearing or the hat and then when we go home, we look forward to the next Sunday, going back repeating it. I get into some discussions that are not very pleasant with some of my friends because they think that I have lost my faith. I think that I live by faith because many of the programs that I have gotten into, only God could have directed me to them and he has been the one who has sustained me in accomplishing some things.
I'm very much impressed by the inaugural address that I have looked at this morning and the inaugural activities. Carter, who has just been elected as President of the United States, has a deep religious faith and I have faith in him that he is really being guided in this position by the Almighty.
Now, we were going to talk about the women's movement somewhat. I guess I am of the old school. I think that God has given woman a privilege that he didn't give man and that is the privilege of giving birth to men. Some of the things advocated by the women's movement I can understand and I can sympathize with, but I am sick and tired of day-care center babies who are being reared without the warmth and the comfort of their mothers. It grieves me to see a mother, five or six weeks after the birth of her child, getting up early in the morning taking it to a day-care center. Somehow, for some reason, we have abandoned the idea of breast-feeding babies. 1 think we've done society a great injustice by not letting that child feel the warmth and comfort of its mother's arms and to receive its nourishment from that mother. Oh, doctors are saying that formulas are better - I'll never believe it; however, it would be better for some women.
But childbearing is a special privilege and you must make preparation for it just like you make preparation for any other institution. So you develop that body, you eat properly, you stay off of cigarettes and liquors. I'm sure that I am stepping on somebody's toes when I say that, but it is a fact of life. One of the saddest pictures that I﻿22
JJC:	(cont) have ever seen was a mother who was breast-feeding her baby.
She had a cocktail in one hand and a cigarette in the other and the ashes from the cigarette were falling in the baby's face while it nursed. These are the kinds of things that have really disturbed me.
Now, as far as a woman getting the same opportunity for employment and being taken off the role of stamp-licking and menial jobs and so forth, I am for it. I think that along with that responsibility of motherhood we have women who are able to fill any position in this country, if given a chance, but men jealously guard these positions.
In the City of Dallas, we do not have any women in policy-making positions. We have one City judge. We have one or two women ... I know of two in the major courthouse. But it isn't that the woman doesn't have the ability, it is because of the jealousy of men. I think women have been required to take more than their share of the burden of life and now we are having complaints from wife-beaters and people who are not getting along.
I think we need to make more preparation for marriage. It is the greatest institution on earth and yet, young people walk into it blindly without knowing the responsibilities required, or they've made no preparation whatsoever for living. It seems to me that the Equal Rights Amendment is going to pass. I believe it is going to pass before this year is over. What effect it is going to have upon our society, I don't know. But I can assure you that in the schools around Dallas, we are having many more adults entering these schools than formerly did. And I am sure that there is going to be a lot of competition for jobs, providing those persons in personnel departments and so forth will recognize them.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, you made some very interesting observations. You mentioned
marriage and I would like to suggest that you go a step further. There seems to be an increase in relationships between male and female now that are without benefit of clergy or without legal status; we sometimes refer to it as "shacking up." I would like to know your feelings about that. I think we discussed earlier, outside of the recording session, the apparent lack of ambition on the part of the students. Perhaps you would address those two issues: relationships without the benefit of legal marriage and the lack of ambition on the part of students.
JJC:	We have in this system now, what is called trial marriage; that young
people will live together as man and wife for so long to decide whether or not they should get married. I think it is one of the most stupid ideas that I have ever listened to. We are not brave enough to confront our youth with the truth.
Then we have what is called "Social Security Sin!" It is amazing to me to see older people who do not get enough Social Security to support themselves - who will live with another partner to have access to a second Social Security check. It is a weakening on the part of our system that we should permit these things to happen and then to accept them. Everything goes. No parent has the guts to say "no" to his or her child, "you should not do that," or "you should change your way of﻿23
JJC:	(cont) living!" Many times a parent has set the example for them.
They too are "shacking up" with somebody that they aren't married to. I don't think that is profitable and I think that even years later people will decide, "Maybe I should have done it a little differently." I have heard youth tell their parents, "Well, you've done so and so," or "You are involved." It is a sad situation when a young person can confront his parents in that manner.
DRR:	Thank you, Mrs. Craft. We have heard some of your observations about
marriage in general and then it occurred to me that we have not yet secured any personal facts from you regarding your own marital status. I believe you are a widow, though. Would you please comment on that for us?
JJC:	I have been married twice. The first time, I married when I was about
20 years old and lived with that husband three and a half years. It was really amusing because we had been sweethearts from the time I was 13 and he was 19. And a strange thing ... the last word my mother spoke to me was that I was going to marry this boy. I did; but she didn't tell me that I wasn't going to stay with him. Three and a half years later, we were separated. But there was something there that was binding to us. We were sweethearts again for another three and a half years and then we were divorced by my hasty action. I was a divorcee for 13 years. He remarried two months before I did. I married a second husband and we lived together 12 years and three months. He died January the 17th, 1950. Since that time, I have been a widow.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, I think I mentioned earlier that your life has been one of
great activity and great variety and we wondered what you considered your greatest achievement. I am sure you would have difficulty in deciding because there have been so many, but certainly, the fact that you are now serving as a member of the Dallas City Council, and a very viable member of that body deserves note. We would certainly like to know something of your role as a member of the Council: how you became interested in it, and perhaps you would want to share with us some of your experiences in campaigning for the office or some of your experiences since becoming a member of the Council.
JJC:	The only thing that I could say in defense of my being on the Council
is, just an old stupid woman who was not satisfied with those persons who were running to fill the unexpired term left on the Council in this District. I think that that's the slogan that I have carried with me - If I don't like what the other fellow is doing, I get up and do it myself.
It was October 1975 that I had been in Washington where I was honored with 22 other women from all over the country for having been active in the community at 73 years old. But one of the 23 was 92 and she was still active; another was 89, another was 85 ... so I was really one of the youngest of the bunch. I came back home and it was in the air about this vacancy on the City Council. I did not see where it was necessary for me to sit here, evaluating the six other persons that were running﻿24
JJC:	(cont) and to be content. I felt that at least if I didn't like
those persons who were running, their records and so forth didn't measure up, I'd get out there myself.
The cry came from many parts of the city. "She's too old, she's too old." And I asked the public, "What am I supposed to do with my 73 years of experience? Am I suppose to bury it? Or am I supposed to get into corners?" So I had to get out there and show them. Some people called it a bitter campaign, but I just said it was a campaign where the truth prevailed. My major opponent was a young man, about 43 years old, who was a fine young businessman and I portrayed him as being a fine young businessman. I didn't think that his being successful himself was as important as was a person who has given his life trying to help the downtrodden and the people in the community. He had no community identification other than he had a maintenance company where he gave people some jobs, yes. But many of the people I was trying to help were people who were not looking for jobs.
I got in the race with six opponents and of course that caused a run-off and then I beat my opponent two to one. I've been on the Council a little more than a year. Dallas is a big city with a budget of approximately 349 million dollars. I didn't know there was that much money in the world as far as my experience along those lines was concerned. During the time I've served on other boards in Dallas, I remember when the budget was less than 100 million, about 98 million. And of course to have this jump and to have to deal with 13,000 employees, it has been an interesting experience. I say literally to my friends that I'm now learning how to go in and out of the door and I don't profess to know how to deal with all the issues.
I have been concerned about rodent control and this is one area in which I have been working. You know, rats are destroying us in this country and it's estimated now to be one rat for every one person in this country. And yet we're feeding them, every day. They are destroying millions of dollars worth of property every day. I was concerned because I didn't think that the people understood what was happening. We made a study of rodent control this year, it has been interesting. You have the Norway rat and the field rat. The Norway rat goes by wire from tree to tree, and then he comes down in a house, in a hole under the roof ... he can get in there. I've had people from the flood area tell me that they thought that squirrels had gotten into their attics. They found out they were rats.
It's amazing the amount of destruction, the amount of food they destroy in a year, plus the cutting in of buildings and so forth. And then people think my house has been rat-proofed. I don't have to worry about them. But I find that a rat is an excellent swimmer. And they can come up through the sewage into your house. So I thought it was very important that somebody would do something about the rats in this community. They will move into any vacant building. They will move into any area where they can find food and water. Most of us carry the problem with us. And that is, dog food. We'll set sacks of dog food﻿25
(cont) out in the garage or the outhouse and that is an attraction for rats to move in.
Since I have been on the Council, it has been an interesting experience to have worked with different departments; the City Secretary, to see what his function is; the City Council office; the City Council where there are 11 members of us. We are required to meet in the Council Chambers one day a week, a second time if the need be. Otherwise we're in briefings, we're making visits to various agencies in the city; we are called upon for public speaking to groups, to schools and it's quite a fascinating experience. I have had requests for my services four and five times a day some weeks. I do what I can and the other, I cancel.
The City Council is the head of the city government. We have a council manager form of government but the City Council has the last word. The Police Department, the Equipment Department - that is a big department, your fire trucks, your garbage trucks, the health vehicles, the ambulances, everything comes under that department. A person never sits down and analyzes what the expense is involved in keeping those machines operating. How many gallons of gasoline do you find? If you have a flat, what do you do? You have these equipment centers that take care of all of those kinds of problems.
Another problem: land fills. Where do you take the trash after you collect it? We were at one time going about 70 miles a day to distribute our trash. We have some land fills that have been bought that are closer in but we're running out of space.
We have in the City of Dallas, a hospital, a city-county hospital that takes an administrator and a large group of people to operate. We work with the school system. There are county roads, and street departments. And of course, these are things that people look upon lightly, until it hits them personally.
We joined in the whole State of Texas to try to eliminate the deterioration of our highways in and out of our cities. In the state it is a multi-billion dollar problem. It's estimated now that the gasoline tax will no longer take care of our highways and freeways. And it will cost the State of Texas from eight to ten billion dollars to repair and rebuild our highways.
Mrs. Craft, earlier today we took a recess from our taping session to watch James Earl, Jimmy, Carter, take the oath of office for the Presidency of the United States. This is really a rather historic day and that was an historic moment. I would like to know what your feelings were as you watched that ceremony? What are your hopes for the Carter administration and what are your predictions for the administration, if you care to make any?
I was an elected Carter delegate. I didn't go to New York (because) I felt the crowds and the hoopla would be more than I wanted, plus the finance involved. I felt I could do Mr. Carter more good here. I﻿26
JJC:	(cont) have had three experiences with him, leading up to his campaign.
I'm very much impressed with the young man. I'm impressed with him because of the faith that he has in himself to do a job and I know it's a difficult job. It's difficult to work in a family situation, let alone with the freedom of speech provisions made in the Constitution, that everybody can speak out against him. I know how discouraging this will be to him. I think that if the people of this country will join hands with Mr. Carter and try to help him instead of criticizing him; however, I believe he can stand up under the criticisms. But I don't want to think in terms of people trying to belittle this man. And that's my opinion of what some people have done. Regardless of what they think about him, he is the President of the United States of America, the greatest country on earth.
I have been concerned for a long time because of our military cut-backs. I've been concerned about our food consumption and consumers' problems. I've been concerned about the synthetic foods that we have been eating. I've been concerned about the health situation. How on earth can a person have medical treatment who is living on a Social Security check? And yet, this is what many of us are required to do. The deterioration of houses, the red-lining of houses, the crumbs that we have gotten from the American table ... it just isn't right. I'm impressed because President Carter believes in work. So do I. I think that a person ought to be required to work for those things that he needs and of course I've heard women say, "Sitting down there and asking for welfare didn't make them feel bad at all." I said years ago that if I ever asked anybody for anything, I would definitely need it. But I think that a lot of people, welfare has taken from them their incentive to do better, to do for themselves -by having things come to them so easily.
I'm concerned about children brought up in housing projects. Their minds are trapped. They are trapped physically. There should be some programs where people can get trained and then jobs provided for them. I cannot ask a woman or a man to go to work if he or she is ill. But, you know, we have what I call habitual welfare recipients; they don't trust themselves so they stay on welfare. Mr. Carter has a difficult, a difficult, trying four years in front of him. He's going to be criticized daily. But I believe he'll be able to weather the storm.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, you are one of the very fortunate persons in America in
that you are a senior citizen, which means that within the next few weeks you will have been on this earth three quarters of a century. You've certainly seen a lot of changes, and because of your maturity and your outlook, you have some rather strong perceptions about what is and what should be. I'd like to ask you, as you see it now, what is the most provoking problem of black women in America today? And while you're at it, would you	comment on illegitimacy, which is
definitely on the increase according to statistics? And also according to statistics, percentage-wise, it's greater among blacks than among other groups, would you please comment.﻿27
JJC:	I disagree with statistics on the fact that illegitimacy is greater
among so-called blacks than other groups. Our girls have no way of hiding it. Whites have been using abortion as a means of destroying their illegitimacy for a number of years. We didn't have the money to do it with. So we have had our babies. We don't adopt them out very fast. The families always are receptive and will take the babies and try to do the best they can, sometimes with the aid of welfare and sometimes without. I attribute our laxity and our interest in illegitimacy a lot to the "boob tube," as I like to refer to television, because many of the pictures that we show our children are suggestive. And I think that as human beings, we ... adult human beings, should know the effect it has on a child.
When a child is born, he is born a rebel. He wants his way about things. A baby decides when it's first born whether or not he wants a light on or whether he wants it off. And we really, believe it or not, usually succumb to his wishes. When a girl is growing up we let the people on the street teach her the facts of life. We never sit down and tell them the truth about births and so forth. So when the child learns a little bit about births and deaths and so forth, well they like to experiment and many of them do not realize how much trouble they can get into, experimenting. Therefore, at a very young age, these things are happening.
Another thing that I think contributes to a lot of illegitimacy is a lack of anything to do. When I was a youngster, I thought my parents were unreasonable sometimes because they kept me busy all the time. But youth nowadays have nothing to do. The parents are gone to work and they leave them in a complete environment to suggest sex or any other exploratory situation they can get themselves into. I don't criticize the young people as much as I criticize the adults. When I think of mothers who think that girls must have things so they have to have another job. If I had my way with this society, I think I would pass laws that mothers could not go to work until their children were out of danger. Oh, that's a precious, precious possession - a child.
And now that I've had this little namesake around me for seven years, to see her developing and to hear her asking questions and to see an inquisitive child wanting to know. I asked her one day, "Why do you ask so many questions?" and she said, "Because I want to know. .." If she wants to know, and most children do, I think it's a responsibility of the parent, of the adult in the family, to teach that child.
The City Council just recently had a report on the status of women. They presented us with 16 propositions on the needs of women in the community, and one of them was battered wives. I am confused. We have so many misfits in the community. There are people who are sexually inclined, who are brutal - they want that beating and so forth. It's so strange that those women never leave those men although they beat them half dead. Now you find this is reversed in many areas; the women are beating the men. It seems that our society is changing with﻿28
JJC:	(cont) homosexuality and prostitutes and all just openly defying
the normal means of living.
In one of the areas, the women were asking for a place for a battered woman to go. And I said that, "Wherever she goes, she's going to go right back to that husband." I've never understood this thing, I don't understand it. The one thing that I do worry about is our misplaced values, our lack of determination to do.
You know, a few years ago we had women who had lost their husbands and who had no jobs and so forth. They had children. They raised those families and people in the community would help them. Now people in the community better not say anything. They get insulted if they say anything; especially about the conduct of the children. And of course the conduct of the children to me is very important because ... I don't know, when I came up anybody could speak to me and tell me when I was doing wrong, but now that's another issue altogether. Nobody can speak to young people any more.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, before we go to the final question that I have on my
notes, I want to ask you one other question. There is this old myth or perhaps it isn't a myth, that Negroes with bright skin or lighter skin sometimes have more advantages or receive favors that are denied persons of darker hue. You are neither what I would consider a very fair Negro nor are you a black Negro, you are a very beautiful brown. Would you tell me, for the sake of the record, what effect if any you have noticed that the actual skin color has had on your life, how you have been received, or what you've been able to do?
JJC:	This is an interesting question because my mother was a light-skinned
woman and for a long time when I was a child, I had to face it - people thought I was her step-child. That was thrown up to me many times ... that I couldn't have been her child. My father used to react to that statement by saying, "Well, I can swear she's her child but I can't swear she's mine." I have learned something about this color situation. It's one reason I resent being called a black. We have all colors in our group. I have seen Negroes with blue eyes and blonde hair, how could you call them black? Then I've seen some dark, dark Negroes. But I have never seen one who was black. I've seen a dark shade of brown.
When I attended the White House Conference on Youth in 1970, a little boy brought a chart showing the proverbial colors of men. He said, "I took this chart to Africa to find a black man and I couldn't find one. But I found a deep shade of brown. And then I went to China looking for a yellow man. I didn't find a yellow man but I found another shade of brown. And then when I looked for the red man, again I found no red man but I found still another shade of brown. And then I looked in the mirror and I found myself a light shade of brown."
Now some of us are of such nature that we have to get out in the sun to bring out our brown look. But what bearing should that have on what is on the inside? This is the part that I've looked at, I've tried to see the contribution that people can make. I've tried to look﻿29
JJC:	(cont) at their hearts more than the color of their skin. Skin
color means nothing to me. I think that when you stick a pin in my arm, I bleed. If you stick a pin in the arm of a Caucasian, he will bleed. But there's no difference in the color of the blood. It's red.
I believe that if there's such a thing as the end of time when man will not be living on this earth, we will have an amalgamation of the races. We have started this. This has been done by man through wars. Since we've had written history, we have had wars. And what happens? As soon as one group wins or makes a conquest, it takes the women. And we have the mixture all over the world. I do think that at the end of time we will have one race.
DRR:	Mrs. Craft, you've been very kind and you have lent your time very
generously to this interview so I certainly want to say a word of appreciation to you on behalf of the Black Women Oral History Project that's being sponsored by the Schlesinger Library of Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As a final item, I think you should be given the freedom to say whatever you would like to say about whatever you would like to speak and in whatever manner you would like to speak, please.
JJC:	Some of my past experiences have been wide and the memoirs that I have
collected are meaningful to me. I have said ofttimes (that) when that great day comes, my obituary is on my walls; you'll find on my walls, some type of memo from many of the areas in which I have served.
I'm a member of the board of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. I was with the dialogue group for a number of years and I found an opportunity to go to the University of the Americas in Old Mexico. It had just been moved outside of the City of Mexico to Chulula, in the State of Puebla, Mexico. I spent a month at the University studying the Mexican culture and the economy of Mexico. I went to Oaxaca to see the ruins at Mitla and the ruins at Monte Alban. I saw poverty for the first time in a country that has been a very backward country until recent years. There's still a lot of catching up to do in Mexico. The University was brand new ... possibly a month old in that location when we went there, everything modern. The architecture was beautiful, more of a Spanish architecture than Mexican.
There were 43 of us in the group that went from the National Conference of Christians and Jews from all over the country. That was an interesting experience for me, a woman 68 years old going back to school. I had had a thyroid operation about a month before I left and I couldn't make the heights, so I didn't go to the top of the pyramids, the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. But it was fascinating to me to think that somewhere in our existence that somebody built those pyramids. I don't think anybody really knows their ages. But many of the things that I saw in Mexico - the date of their construction was in the 15 hundreds, 1535. The church was built in 1535 and the pyramids were built back in that area. The thing that was most interesting was the conquest of Mexico by the French. They brought with them blacks, dark-colored people, the Moors. And then when Cortez came from Spain, he brought with him dark-skinned people. It was from that group that one young man had some brown seeds in his pocket and when they﻿30
(cont) were planted, that was the introduction of wheat into this continent. I said, "I guess he didn't know what he was doing but he did us a favor. Now we have the wheat that we need."
When I listened to people talking about the separation of races - at that time, the concubines were given to the soldiers ... in Cortez's conquest, and of course, there was a mixture. I'm sure that the dark-skinned soldiers weren't standing back while the others received the services of the concubines. At Vera Cruz, you'll find most of the population is very dark-skinned, with the straight black hair. There is a colony somewhere in the interior there near Acapulco where the people are still hostile; they separated themselves from the rest of Mexico. It's interesting to have had that experience.
On one occasion I went to the Bahamas where I saw another culture which was interesting. To see that the islands, all of those 700 islands ... in flying over, seeing them jutting up out of the sea makes me feel that there is a God because no man could do that. However, the Isle of St. George and Paradise Island have been connected by a causeway. Flamingos have been housed there for tourists to see. The buildings are different but very close to this country.
I spent a day and a half in Canada. We drove from Detroit up to Holiday Beach and Amsberg. Amsberg is where I went to a museum and saw what the Canadian French had done to help the Negro slaves when they would escape. It was fascinating to me and I say to young people all the time ... together we do these things, you haven't done anything alone.
I've been a life member of the N.A.A.C.P. for a number of years and among the youth that I've worked with, there are two life memberships. We made a special study of the history of the Negro in this country. Dr. Charles Drew who perfected blood plasma made an outstanding contribution to this country. But when we set aside days to recognize the contributions made by these people, we have difficulty getting them through Congress. It's hard to get Congressmen to vote for them.
In Texas we had Dorry Miller. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, this little boy from Waco (Texas) who had not been trained to handle the guns; he was in the kitchen, in the mess department, he grabbed a gun and shot down two or three Japanese planes. All I'm asking for is to give us a chance.
I knew Walter White personally. I knew Ralph Bunche personally; Judge (William) Hastie, Bishop (Stephen) Spottswood, (Justice) Thurgood Marshall - these are the types of people I've worked with over a period of time. I've had a lot of experience with the N.A.A.C.P. because I've attended every national convention since 1944. I served on one committee for 31 years, the credentials committee, which makes me a very well known person all over these United States. And of course at this point I have visited in some manner 41 of our 50 states. I hope that if my health continues, I'll be able to do a few more.﻿31
JJC:	(cont) Locally I have worked on committees in the City of Dallas for
a number of years. I have received the Mayor's Award for Environmental Excellence because I am concerned about the deterioration, the litter, and the things that would destroy the beauty of this city. I served six years on the Community Council of Greater Dallas, rotated off for a year and now I'll begin my second term on the 25th of this month. I have worked with the Police Department. We had a program called "Operation Get Involved" ... trying to teach the neighbors how to get involved and how to cooperate with each other. That was a three-year period. I served for four years on the Urban Rehabilitation Standards Board. When I left the Board two years ago, I was Vice-Chairman.
I have worked with the educational system here. I received the Golden Apple award by the Classroom Teachers of Dallas. I've spent a lot of time visiting schools and trying to teach the children that they can get along. One of the most exciting experiences I've had was at H. Grady Spruce High School. They have a program there called "I Care." And I've used that in many places ... if you care, you will go beyond the required area to help.
I served on the Governor's Human Relations Committee for three years under Governor Preston Smith. I was honored in 1970 by a club in Fort Worth, when they were looking for what they called an outstanding woman in the city of Dallas. I received the Tremont Retirement Center Award in December 1975. I was one of 33 nominees and I was selected as number one. My picture is to be hung in the building along with two other persons. The two others were Caucasian men.
My life does not belong to me. I have no particular family, some cousins, but I have nobody that I'm particularly responsible to. Therefore, I have adopted everybody. And I feel that if I can make any contribution to the lives of any person I want to be about that.
My term on the City Council - I have been criticized. It has been said that I was low-key and so forth. But I have my own priorities and in one year you cannot get very much done. I am going to file in a few days to run for a second term ... a term of my own because at this time I'm filling out an unexpired term. I owe a lot to the city of Dallas. I came here 52 years ago. I have lived here, I have grown here, I have made my contribution here. I've had no money but I've had service; I've had time and I've given that.
It was in 1972 that the city of Dallas renamed a park for me, the Juanita Jewel Craft Park and Recreation Center. Since I've been on the Council I've been able to - through a bond program that was passed last year - get the promise of a swimming pool which will be built very soon, also a couple of tennis courts. This park is a 22 acre concern along with a health center, a gymnasium, a center for pregnant women and a playground. It is in the very part of town where it's needed, near a housing project.
I am definitely opposed to building any other low-rent housing projects*﻿32
JJC:	(cont) anywhere in this country, because to me they're human
traps. There are people who live there who never will want to get out of them. And yet the conditions surrounding them are certainly not acceptable for growth or expansion. I took three boys from that project to New Orleans and spent a week trying to get them to get on a ferry and ride across the Mississippi River. They were afraid. One was 15, one was 16 and one was 17. They hadn't been exposed to anything like that before. But one of the boys ... when we came back, just couldn't settle himself down and was kicked out of his regular classroom work and put in the Metropolitan School. I went to see him. I went to the third party hearing with him and I went to see him after he was put in the Feather School, a school for dropouts and kids who gave trouble and things of that sort. He moved out of the project and moved into a residential area with a sister. This past June he finished high school and got a scholarship in the field of basketball to Grambling University.*
I have been working with the city on another problem in the project area. There are three lakes down there. They are man-made lakes but we have them restocked with catfish and I'm trying to encourage them to put in a crawfish farming area. If crawfish farming is a success in Louisiana - there's just an imaginary line between the two states - it can be developed here. We have a natural swampy environment for it. Again you have an area of people who are trapped and those little kids can learn a trade by going down and working with the crawfish and possibly someday can build a good business out of it.
These are the kinds of things that I have been interested in. Yes, they're low-key because there is a lot of thinking and a lot of study that has to be put into them. It has been interesting to find people who ask me many times, "Don't you get lonely, living by yourself?" And I say, "But I'm not by myself, I'm with the people." There's no day that somebody doesn't ring my doorbell, just dropping by. "Just wanted to see you." When I walk down the street, there's not a block hardly that I can walk in that I don't find somebody that I know who will say a kind word. Some days the telephone really gets to be annoying because I can't get to it fast enough to answer it. And there are people who will call as late as two o'clock in the morning. I do not have an unlisted telephone because if people have problems, and I am their Council representative, I want to be trying to solve them.
I have come to almost the end of a very full life. I don't know what the answer is. I don't know what God has in store for me. But I am grateful that he has let me be a part of the changes that have been made in this country for a number of years. I have enjoyed some of the things that I was denied while I was a younger woman. As I said, I've had four Presidential invitations to White House conferences, I've seen nine Presidents in person, I've had three visits with Mr. Carter and I think that Mr. Carter is going to do a good job.
I am happy to have been included in this project of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Radcliffe
* Grambling, Louisiana﻿JJC:	(cont) College. I have been to Cambridge, Massachusetts. I have
been in the area of Cambridge. I like to say that I've been to Cambridge but people get the wrong idea that I'm saying I attended school there. Thank you very kindly for this privilege and I hope that I've been of some service.
DRR:
Thank you, Mrs. Craft.﻿JUANITA JEWEL CRAFT
