This is Genii Guinier, talking with Dorothy West, on the beautiful island of Martha's Vineyard. Dorothy West, you will recall, is a writer of the Harlem Renaissance. This is May 6, 1978.
Adelaide Gulliver, you know her?
Right. She's at Boston University.
And for three or four years, Adelaide has said to me... I have a drawer at Boston University. What's the name of the library? It's in their library.
Mugar Library.
Right.
You don't mind if I make the tea while you're talking?
No, make the tea, no. manner, don't you?
You understand my
Yes, I do, I do. The tea will make us relax.
Well, let me tell you, it's so interesting. I'm getting older, and I never will forget, when my mother, oh, I don't know how old she was—sixty or something of that sort— and she said to a friend of mine, "Madeline, do this and do that." And I was horrified. Afterwards I apologized to my friend, because I said, "Don't forget, my mother is older." Because I suppose I now have reached the age when I say, "Do this, do that." Do you follow what I... Do you understand?
Yes. [laughter]
And please forgive me. Understand me and forgive me, you see. Because I talk like that to the kids, you know—there are the kids in my family, and they obey me, because they know. I suppose that behind my back they say, "Poor thing, she's getting old." But at any rate...﻿2
GG: So you were talking about...
DW: Yes, oh my God.
CG: ...the collection at Yale?
DW: All right. So my point is, three or four years ago, Adelaide Hill kept saying to me—I mean, understandably—she kept saying to me, "Write to Yale University, and ask them to give you..." As a matter of fact, she wrote the letter for me. Every time she saw me, she said, "Have you written to Yale?" and I said no. And she wrote the letter for me, and the letter is someplace, and so on and so on. However, my point about that is...because now I'm going to bring in Boston University. In the meantime, there was an interest in black women. I would get letters from young people asking me for more information. One young woman told me she read a letter by Claude McKay, do you know Claude McKay?
GG: Yes.
DW: And his letter says, "Beware of Dorothy West when she comes smiling* She wants something." [laughter] He wrote that letter to Carmen Dixon, that's when I had started the magazine...
GG: That's funny, 'cause they say the same thing about Genii Guinier.
"Look out for Genii Guinier. If she comes smiling, she wants something ."
DW: There was a young man from Georgetown University. He wrote me that he had been to Yale, and the point of that is, I waited so long. I don't know whether Yale will be willing to give up my stuff. Do you know what I mean? Do you know enough about that sort of thing?
GG: No. Well, I know enough to know that there's probably a jurisdiction question, and I don't think you should make any decision hastily. You decide where you'd like your papers.
DW: All right. Now, now I will get to Boston University. I'd been going there for about six years, well, I still do, occasionally. When I say six years, don't misunderstand me. That only means about eight lectures. I don't mean that I've been going there monthly. But my point is, almost every time I've gone, I've looked in my thing. I have found letters from Langston Hughes. I have found an original poem by Countee... Countee Cullen wrote a poem to me, and he sent me the original and a reprint. It's in one of the collections, it just says "D. W." But he was in Paris, and he wrote it and the poem reads...he would like me to be there, and so forth and so on. And I took that to Boston University...
GG: Excuse me, do you take lemon and sugar?
DW: Yes. One spoon, just one. Most people think you want two. And I drink a cup with two teaspoons with great difficulty. When I was a child I wouldn't eat sweets at all. Hated sweets.﻿3
GG: Good for you.
DW: No, it isn't. Because now that I'm older and fatter, I eat sweets. Would not trust them when I was a child. "It's too sweet." And I remember when we had frosting—now I know that my mother knew what we were doing—I would take the frosting off and give it to my sister or my cousin. And I know it's funny. My point is, you think your mother doesn't know what you're doing, and she knows everything you're doing.
GG: You know, I'll tell you something about appreciating mothers; you appreciate them after they're gone.
DW: Listen, my mother was a genius, and I thought my mother was the most... I was ashamed of her. My father, I told you about my father, and told you about my mother. I was ashamed of them, because they were colored people, and they were black. I was so ashamed of them. [laughter] It's a darn shame.
GG: I don't know whether we'll ever be able to correct that. It just seems to be a tradition, to be ashamed of parents...
DW: Well, let me tell you what happened. I tried very hard not to be like my mother. We all did. Then my mother died, and then we would talk to each other, and we would say, "You sound just like Rachel." We were all on a first-name basis. And we'd get very mad. Then the years passed. "All right, so I do sound like her. So what?" And now, you know what we say? We like it, and we're glad. Isn't that something?
GG: See now, she's up there smiling.
DW: Yes. It's the most interesting thing. Because one of them made the observation [that] because we were a tribal, not tribal, what do you call those...
GG: Extended families.
DW: Well, at any rate, there were a lot of cousins and one thing and
another. One person made the observation, "Isn't it interesting that the people who were raised by Rachel are different," and they meant better. Well, she was a logic... That's why I don't care to think about money things. She had a logic...she didn't care about small things. She hated small things.
GG: You think it's generally a tradition for people to appreciate people after they're gone?
DW: Yes. Because young people fight with me, and when I'm gone they...
It's interesting, I have a niece, she's going to be just like me. I know that, I can tell that. And she fights me every step of the way. And yet last summer I was talking to her, and I said, "You never listen to anything I say," or something like that. She said with great reluctance, "I hear everything you say."﻿4
GG: And she's not going to...
DW: You know what I used to do when I was fifteen years old? When my mother was talking to me, I stuck my fingers in my ears and sang "My Country "lis of Thee." And now I remember I heard every word she said.
GG: Okay, I7m just going to stop this now for one minute.
DW: I was in London many years ago when I was about twenty years old,
and I was out to dinner. Milk was my drink. And I was out to dinner with a group of four or five women, and the youngest one was about thirty-five. It was at night, and I've forgotten the restaurant in London. And the waitress said, "Coffee, tea, or milk?" and I said, "Milk." It's funny, when you're young, and...oh, God. But at any rate, they brought the milk and put it there.
GG: What's the oh, God for?
DW: Because you don't know how marvelous it is to be young. [laughter] You are so ashamed of being young.
GG: Inexperience, that's what you're ashamed of.
DW: Yes, and I looked, and there was not a glass of milk anywhere, all
around the restaurant. I felt as small as that. And you see, I told you I was with these five women? Now, I guess they thought I was cute. I said, "Oh, God, they're dying of shame that they're sitting here at a table with somebody who has a glass of milk." And I never touched the glass of milk. And from that moment on, whenever I went out to eat, I ordered coffee, which I hated. But this was London. Do you know what white coffee is?
GG: Yes, mostly milk.
DW: It was coffee with...they poured the coffee and the milk at the same time, then they gave you cream. So that, really, the taste of coffee was minimal.
GG: it was called white coffee?
DW: They called it white coffee, yes. What I had was white coffee wi cream. The white coffee is the coffee...
GG: ...with milk in it.
W: Yes. And then white coffee with cream, you see. But now, of course I have to have my coffee. It's a long time since I was twenty years old, you know.
GG: DW:
Well, it7s interesting. My husband.
Mmm, this is... What is this? This is very good.﻿5
GG: It's cinnamon stick tea.
DW: Ah, lovely. You mean it comes like that, or do you stick a stick of. ..
GG: No, it comes like that.
DW: Beautiful, beautiful.
GG: In Cambridge, I put the cinnamon stick in myself; here I just use the actual tea bag with the cinnamon.
DW: I had a friend — did you ever... How long have you been here? Did you know Jimmy Coleman?
GG: No.
DW: All right. She was a woman who, well, I don't know why her mother wanted to name her Jimmy. And the Father—not the priest, I guess the minister—said, "You can't name this child Jimmy, call her Jaime." So her legal name is J-A-I-M-E, but since her mother liked the name Jimmy...and I've known her all of my life. But you know that—this has nothing to do with it—that's a very interesting family. And sometimes I blame "the white man," because I have known that family for six generations, and now they're all on the white side, every one. They didn't mean to go on the white side. And I remember when one of the kids...
GG: The pull is very strong.
DW: Well, no. The point is, very often—I don't know how often that you realize this—a white man falls in love with a fair-skinned black girl, and so that he knows she's colored, and so forth. Then they get married—we say, they have a colored—well, that's old-fashioned, they have a colored wedding. Then they get on the train, and he says, "They don't know yet." His family.
GG: Oh. They're going up to his folks.
DW: That's right. Then she gets pregnant, and he says, "All white people think that black babies are born, so just wait till we're just..." And so forth and so on, and years pass. It is so interesting to me, because it just so happens that... And we call each other up and the children talk to me; they don't know I'm black. You know what I mean? And I mean, it's just one of those ironies.
GG: Sad separations.
DW: That's right, that's right. Because I understand that when the black ...well, I had a cousin who came back. When the black revolution started—I don't know whether you read this or were aware of this— when the black revolution started about fifteen years ago, we didn't know what was going to happen. I mean, people didn't know what was going to happen. And so many black people, including a cousin of mine, who were passing for white, came back so that they could be on﻿6
DW: (cont.) the black side when the... Oh, that was common. I mean, that was a common saying among the...
GG: Yes. That is not something I was aware of.
DW: They said that all over the country blacks came back. Because they thought there was going to be a real war—I mean, bloodshed, bloodshed in the streets, you see.
GG: What a story there is in that! Now that was true, I think friends
of ours had told us, in Jamaica. Some people who had chosen to disassociate themselves came back in because, they also felt that... Well, maybe it's not just fear, maybe it's a final sense of identification, you know. When the chips are down, where are you going to be? And that thought makes people shape up.
DW: Yes, and I don't know whether you think about dying as you grow older,
well, what do you want to___ I don't know whether this phrase will
mean anything to you, but I mean, do you want to die white, or do you want to die black? I mean, you were born black. I don't know. Because I must say, there have been some fair-skinned people in my family, and a couple of them have... But it's always, well, I think it's always an accident. And you know that "nice" colored people are not supposed to pass for white. I don't know whether you know that.
GG: Oh, yes, I do know that.
DW: Yes. Nice colored people are not supposed. Because I know one of our relatives passed for white, and my mother's common phrase—I don't remember, as I was only a child—but I think she said—they knew what she was saying—that "she was dead," you know, or something of that sort. You know that I'm writing a book?
GG: No. Tell me about that.
DW: Well, the reason I say that is because many—oh, what shall I say
scholars, or people involved in writing, feel that I'm one of the few ... Those few who know me—I'm not generally known—that I'm one of the few who knows the black middle class. So that therefore I do write about the black middle class. I have a story called "The Wedding." The setting is here. But the point... these are fair-skinned people. I don't know how much you know about black people but, I mean, there is a class, and most of them are fair-skinned. And because there are quite a few light-skinned people in my family, I always take up the cudgels for them. Because you can understand what happened, don't you? They were fair because they were the children of their masters, or something. And in many cases, their masters... Well, this is how my own family started, on my mother's side. My mother's father and, indeed, my mother's mother, were the children of their masters. Do you follow me?
GG: Yes.
All right. And therefore, when slavery was over, the white master gave my great-grandmother, who had eleven children by him, he gave﻿7
DW: (cont.) her a great tract of land, and told her to take her children up there, and so forth and so on, and he gave them pigs and cows and one thing and another. So that they were a little better off, you see. They were house servants, as you know. You know about that, there were house...and I think there was some interest in the house servants. At any rate, you learned a great deal from watching the people in the big house. My point is, it is not so much a color difference. Actually, there is a color difference because, as I said, they were the children of white people, so that therefore they were light in color, but it wasn't their color that made the difference. Do you follow what I'm saying?
GG: Yes, it was their identification.
DW: And the opportunities that they had. Because there are many white... children of mixed blood who were sent to colleges by their white fathers. Do you see what I mean? So. And I think I say this because I know so... As you probably know, in the black race, there
are a great many distinctions. Oh, and I'll bring you back to my novel, because my novel, of course, is about black people.
GG: This is a novel that you're writing?
DW: That's right. I got a grant for it, and then Harper and Row took it, and then the black revolution started. I don't know how aware you were, but being a writer, I was aware of that. All the reviews were written by blacks the literary reviews.
GG: Young blacks, you mean?
DW: That's right. And they ran down every...like Riley...
GG: Clayton Riley?
DW: They ran down every story that had to do with middle... They hated
the middle-class black. And, of course, that's the point of my story. The middle-class black wasn't born rich and middle class. The families that I am writing about, they started just like everybody else, you see.
GG: So what you're saying is that you decided not to have it published at that time, because you...
DW: I stopped writing it. I didn't finish it.
GG: Well, how close to finishing are you?
DW: I have a beautiful white character...well, the reason I say I have a beautiful white character is that she lived to be a hundred. Because I had a friend...I borrowed a friend's grandmother. Although I made my character... My friend, who is brown skinned, had a grandmother who was pure white. That's what fascinated me. She had nothing to do with blacks. It was that her daughter married a black man, so that﻿8
DW: (cont.) Granny went through life not liking black people. But it so happened that my brown-skinned friend's mother was a totally white person in color. And so Granny lived with that daughter, and the reason she lived with that daughter is because that daughter married a black man, that's why my friend was brown. She married a black man who had money.
GG: So that her mother was willing to forget about her prejudices...
DW: No, she was not. Because she called this little girl "the black
baby." She would have nothing to do with the black baby, my friend.
GG: But she stayed in the house?
DW: She had to. She was ninety-odd years old, where could she go, see? I mean, that's the irony of it. She had no place to go. That's my point. Her age was such that all of her white relatives had died, and the only relative she had left was her fair-skinned daughter, who had married a black man and produced a brown child, whom she called the "little black baby." Then it came Granny's time to die, and my friend Marian was about three or four years old, and Granny clung to the bedpost and said, "I want Baby to forgive me, I want Baby to forgive me." Marian was told that story. But her mother would not let her in. I mean, she thought it would be too traumatic for a child to have this... I think that is a fascinating story. In my story, this woman is an aristocrat, and she has been through all these successive... Like that Granny, she did not marry black; her daughter did. And so she had to live... Then, because she got older and older, in the end, of course, all of her white relatives were dead, and so here she is...
GG: What was her relationship with the black son-in-law?
DW: Well, I think... I admit that's some of my best writing. And I think that on the strength of that, I got the grant and one thing and another. Because...
GG: My guess is that he was the one with adult leadership.
DW: Well, now, wait a minute.
GG: Meaning that he functioned like an adult.
DW: He respected her. Well, in the first place, I told you I made her an aristocrat. So that, therefore, he respected that. Because she was a lady, and one thing and another, and he married her daughter, and he treated her... He was somewhat servile to her. I don t think he ate with her. He treated her with great deference, not because she was...well, yes, of course, because she was white. But also, he was an ex-slave, and I think he became a professor or the head of a college in the end. I'm saying two things to you.
GG:
I felt that he would give the leadership.﻿9
DW: Well now, what do you mean by leadership?
GG: For her to change, if there were any possibility of change in her.
DW: I don't know. I don't know whether...
GG: You think she would.
DW: Now, I will say this. In this book—I don't know how much you know about writing—she is a character who does go from... Well, I don't mean for you to read my mind. She makes the greatest change.
GG: Wait, wait, say that last thing again. She's the character who goes...
DW: ...from black to white. Well, I won't say that. From A to Z, I'll put it. So, I don't want you to get confused by color. She is the character that goes... And that's the best character, if you can have a character that goes from A to X, you know. You see. So I think that's why she fascinates me. Because she is the one...
GG: Yes, but the...
DW: Well, don't forget I'm writing a story, and she can't make that change in the beginning of the story. She has to wait to make that change at the end of the story.
GG: And the force...
DW: She was still a child, because... All right. She lives with her...
Well, this is what has happened. Now I bring in the young generation. Because I begin way back in slavery. I did some beautiful work there, I think.
GG: I'd love to read it.
DW: Yes?
GG: I would.
DW: i have it. I mean, I have the part that I have typed, the five chapters. Well, when I say five chapters, you submit fifty... As you know, you submit fifty pages, and I have those fifty pages in which ...the stuff that I'm telling you now.
GG: If you would trust me, I would love to read it.
DW: May I just interrupt myself to tell you this, them. 'Cause that's the thing I care about. My point is, I work for the Gazette, and one thing and another, and I do my little lectures, and I give my little interviews, and so forth. But that's what I really want to do.
GG: Write that story.
Vineyard Gazette﻿10
DW: I want to finish...I want to write that.
GG: You should.
DW: I mean, it's very intriguing. People have scolded me—well, when
I say people, my editor and one thing and another—scolded me when... You see, it's a good book, I think. Now I may be wrong, but I think I knew what I was doing. I think if it had come out then, it would have been lost entirely. It would have been reviewed in...
GG: Well, you may be right.
DW: You know why I know I'm right? Alex Haley said so. Not that...
he doesn't know I'm on earth. I read, and I felt justified—I read an interview with him, oh, I don't know, this winter—and he said that if Roots had come out ten years ago, you see... And if my book had come out fifteen years ago, I mean, you know, they would not...
GG: I see what you're saying.
DW: Yes. And see, that would have destroyed me, but I mean, I would
never have written another line. Because I was giving that my best effort. Because I wrote The Living Is Easy, and a lot of people like it, but I know that that was not the best thing that I could do, and I think that "The Wedding" is one of the best things that I could do. I have a short story called "The White Tribe of Indians." My mother was half white, and she lived and died without ever admitting that she was half white, oh, simply because if she had said she was half white, she would have said, "What difference does it make? My mother was a bastard and my father was a bastard."
[The telephone rings]
DW: The telephone breaks my mood. You want me to tell you a story about the telephone?
GG: Yes, I want you to tell me a story about the telephone.
DW: My father was quite well-to-do, but he never gave my mother any
money. So when I was seven years old, I read a little thingamajig, and it said that they would give you a moving picture camera. I wrote a story about this called "The Five-Dollar Bill," but I never got it back. Well, at any rate, if you sold some magazines for them, they would give you a movie camera. So the material came, magazine subscriptions, and my father took them and sold them to his friends —I don't know how much—at a dollar apiece, and he gave the money to me, five dollars. My mother took the five dollars. And my father said to me, "Dimmy, I haven't got the magazines," and one thing and another. And I was going to my mother, and my mother was always going to give me the five dollars, but she never... She pawned, my mother pawned everything she had.﻿11
DW: (cont.) Well, it doesn't make any difference. But the point is, then I got this letter. See, my mother always expected me to be twenty-five years old. I was seven. The letter came through the mail from the company saying that they had not received any money^ from me, and that they were going to put me in jail. They had this story, they had made up... I don't know whether that was legal, though. But they had, it was a newspaper that they had made up, and told a story about this seven-year-old child who had been put in jail. Well, when I say my mother expected me to be twenty-five, I showed it to her and she said, "They don't put seven-year-old children in jail." Which was true. But every time the phone rang, I hid under the bed, 'cause I thought it was the policeman^coming for me. So I do react to telephones; I hate telephones. 'Cause that's the one thing I'm a little temperamental about, about writing.
GG: Well, now, I think writing is a very important thing to you. The next piece of equipment you might want to buy...
DW: Yes, yes?
GG: ...is one that provides an answering service.
DW: Isn't that funny?
GG: See, then you could turn it off.
DW: There are quite a few answering services down here, I think. But private people have them.
GG: No, it's a mechanical thing. I think it costs something like a hundred and twenty dollars. You attach it to your phone when you don t want to be interrupted, and so the machine answers the phone.
DW: Oh.
GG: The person calling gets a tape-recorded answer.
DW: Oh, the machine says something.
GG: Yes, the machine has a tape on which you say, "This is Dorothy West, I'm not able to talk to you right now. I'll call you back as soon^ as I can. Please leave your name and phone number after the buzz.
DW GG
Oh, all right.
Haven't you ever gotten calls...
DW: Yes, I hate those things. I hate everything mechanical.
GG: See, that is a way to protect the key thing that you're doing. Writing is something...
DW: Because I will admit, that's the only... I think that's the only place I'm temperamental. Because I'm writing, and you call me at﻿12
DW: (cont.) half-past nine in the morning... Oh, you're just a simple person, then I feel like, "Come right now. May is wasted and gone."
GG: Last night when I came here, I knew no one knew I was here, so I
started writing, and it just gave me such a good feeling that no one would interrupt what I was trying to do. And I think periodically, that's what you're entitled to, that kind of total relaxation. 'Cause writing is a struggle.
DW: I have a little illustration, and this happens to be true. I mean, there is a scene—there is a dog, there is a child, there is a man, there is a woman, I think there are five... And I number these things. And I said, I have to get my... And the reason I say dog, because it does happen that the dog is supposed to be sort of pivotal. The dog is important when I introduce...he's in there, and I have to tell you his habits and one thing and another. And the the child, "I'm not a child," and I've got three little girls in there, all different, 'cause that's the point of it. Because I call one child— every man has a heart's child—and this particular little girl is his heart's child, and though I hope you don't know it, the dog and the child are going to have a very important, you see, very important...
GG: This is still part of the novel you're talking about?
DW: This is the novel that I'm talking about, yes. Did you know that you're supposed to be able to tell a novel in one sentence, the plot of a novel? You know Egri at all? Do you know Egri?
GG: Egri? No.
DW: Oh. Well, he was everybody's bible about twenty-five years ago. Egri. He wrote, first of all, The Art of Dramatic Writing. It was so popular that I think he also wrote The Art of Creative Writing, and he was everybody's bible. As a matter of fact, I don't think I have anything, 'cause everybody stole...
GG: So what is your...
DW: But I think I know how to write. You know when I first began to write?
GG: When?
DW: When I was about... This is kind of funny. The Boston Post? And I say it's funny, because your family sees you so differently. Do you remember the Boston Post? All right. They printed short stories, daily short stories, and at the end of the week, you either got the two-dollar prize, or the five-dollar prize, or the ten-dollar prize. Nine times out of ten, I got the ten-dollar prize, and that meant something to my family. They didn't think that... That meant_that they had ten extra dollars. And the thing that is so interesting, when Dorothy was writing a story, they knew that at the end of the﻿13
DW: (cont.) week she'd get the ten-dollar prize. And sometimes I got the two-dollar prize, and everybody was so disappointed. And, of course, I felt embarrassed and guilty that I had not got the ten-dollar prize. But I guess that's good.
Because I never will forget years ago, I had two kids in my family, the kids in my family are in my car, two seventeen-year-old kids., and they were in the back seat. I had picked up this silly woman who, when I say silly... She flattered me. I hate flattery. We were going to a beach party or something, and I had picked her up. To show her gratitude for my driving her all the way to the south shore, she began to talk about my book. I don't think she had ever read it. The Living Is Easy, and so forth and so on. And I happened
to glance at the rearview___the window—I had the two kids with me,
they were seventeen—and I cannot tell you the expression on their faces. Because all of a sudden, I was no longer Aunt Dorothy, I was a writer! They were terrified. I remember, it was the most interesting reaction. And I'll tell you about my mother then. Most interesting, and so I remember that I thought... So I said, "I've got to get an extra package of frankfurters," and so forth and so on. And I could see they were relaxed, they were relaxed. Well, it's because they had not thought, they didn't want to...
All right. I told you my mother was beautiful. And I didn't know she was beautiful. I mean, you know, she was my mother. The only thing about it was, I used to say to her, "I don't like other faces." Now I'll tell you a little something. I was the only dark person, nine times out of ten, I was the only dark person in my family, in the group I was the darkest. Somebody has to be the fairest, and somebody has to be the darkest. And it was interesting, you know, in my family... I forgot that, we had a little blond boy; he was the fairest, and I was the darkest, and my mother liked dressing us alike. When she took us out, she used to say to us... I wish I had been like my mother in these respects. She used to say to us, Come on, children, let's go out and drive the white folks crazy." And we did.' Because they looked at this little black girl and this little blond boy dressed absolutely, totally alike. Oh, God!
GG: Why is it that this same pastiche of colors is reflected in Puerto
Rican families? You know, this variation, this whole range of color, and there's a much more total acceptance of all of the differentiations .
DW: I know, because black people, black Americans, try to be very careful with Puerto Ricans, and one thing and another. Because to us, a brown person is a black person.
GG: Oh, yes. That's true.
DW: Yes. Do you see what I mean? My point is, I know I have a beautiful plumber; he's brown. And so one day we were talking, I'm friendly with him, and I said something about, maybe I said, "We colored people." He seemed to be taken aback. And I said, "Oh, God." I know friends of mine have told me that they have looked at a black person﻿14
DW: (cont.) from someplace and just took it for granted that the... I
don't know what they think of us, because no matter how white we are, we call ourselves black, you see. And I suppose that probably seems strange...
GG: American acculturation.
DW: Listen. Let me tell you something that happened. We have a kid in the family who's blond, blue-eyed, he had an Irish father. My niece was calling me from New York. She was talking about him. This was a few years ago. And she was talking about him, and she said, He has a black nose." Well, I'm quick. She said, "He has a black nose. So I got very excited. The reason I say that is because, because... I got excited, I remembered it. And I said, "Why did you drop that child?" We never dropped you when you were a baby, and so ^ forth and so on. I went on raving. And she said, "Dorothy, I don t mean..." See, the word black, I was not as used to it as she was. She said, "Dorothy, I don't mean that he has a black-and-blue nose. I mean that..." Well, my point is, so I was aware of this. And then, he was about two or three years old, and I looked at television thereafter, and everybody had a "black" nose. There was no child who had a thin, aquiline nose. Do you know what I mean? So that, therefore, it's very hard to tell. Because I work in Harborside. And people will come into the...
GG: Tell us, what is it that you're doing at Harborside now? I know you told me last year that... When I last talked to you, you said it s very important for you to be on the job certain days because the tolks there say, "When you're here, Dorothy, everything goes smoothly. You'd better be here!" I know what that was.
DW: When?
DW:
When we invited you to that big reception, you were unable to come. You sent your apologies for not coming.
It must have been a Saturday. Was it a Saturday?
GG: Yes. We had a reception for Judge Dorothy Burnham a year ago.
DW: Because I've been trying to reach her, just to do a little piece about her in the Gazette.
GG: She's hard to reach. But anyway, you're still working as a cashier at Harborside?
DW: That's right. And I think the thing is this, I'm a good actress. So that, therefore, when we are very busy, they look at me and 1 m as calm as a cucumber. And I mean, that's it, you see. I set the pace, I set the pace. And Kenny, he's the manager, and Kenny will come o and he'll just stand there, and I know what he wants, he wants my assurance. And I said, "Kenny, we're doing great tonight. men there will be a little waitress who's very nervous, and I 11 say, "You're doing fine tonight." I mean, that sort of thing, you see.﻿15
GG: That's interesting.
DW: Well, I guess it's interesting, but black people do that. It's very interesting, 1 mean, that they...
GG: Supportive.
DW: All right. No. 1 never... That's the best word you could have used. That's right. I mean, I just do it. I mean, it's a natural thing for me to be supportive, I guess. I mean, it's a natural thing, perhaps, for a black person to be supportive. Because that's it. I've never used that word, but that's what it is. I feel them look at me sometimes to see how Dorothy...and I'm sitting there as calm as a cucumber. Maybe a great mistake has been made. If a mistake is made, I write on the check, "error." And I go on as if there had been no error. You know what I mean? I don't fall apart and go to pieces. So that's it. I mean, that's really why. And every year they call me, and I say, "I don't want to work. I'm too old to work." And then my little, my bitter little joke is, "But they pay me for working." [laughter]
GG: Now, what about the Gazette? What's your relationship with them? You write a weekly column...
DW: Yes, that's right, and occasionally in-depth interviews with visitors to the island.
GG: When we first talked about Yale University, I'm not sure I understood exactly what happened with the material at Yale.
DW: Well, my point is, I know people are using it. I was going to write Yale, however, and ask them if I might have my material.
GG:
Oh, I see. And you haven't written it yet.
°W: No. But that was just lax. But the point is, in the meantime, the
past three or four years, many college professors or students... But in the past few years, there has been this interest in black women. So that therefore, the material that may have been unread for many years, is now of interest. As I said, I will get a letter from somebody who wants to come and interview me, and he says, "I have been at Yale, and I read your material," and so forth and so on. Almost every letter I get—I don't get that many—but almost every letter I get mentions... More often, they mention Boston University, because I've just been giving my stuff to Boston University. And my stuff... The James Weldon Johnson—I don't know how much I have. I have no idea. I know I have some letters from... You didn't know Carl Van Vechten, of course.
GG: No, but I know of him.
DW: Oh. Well, he used to write. He did write, I must say, charming
postcards. He would write, and I have given them to Boston University. Because he always signed himself, "Carl and a dozen Nubian slaves," you know. Quite charming cards. But the point is, I remem-﻿16
(cont.) ber one card that he wrote me. I had sent him some material, and he thanked me, but he said that was not what he wanted; he wanted the original. And my point is, so there may be some, just short stories, but there may be some originals there. The reason I told you that is...
What I was going to say, I think you should begin to think of where you want to keep your papers. And probably, you know, they should be in one place.
All right. Now then.
It makes it easier from the point of view of scholars... That's right.
You know, it's hard for most of them to travel from one place to the other.
You're quite right.
So that could be a reason for centralizing things.
That's right. All right. And then, of course, as I told you... So now we've taken care of Yale. So they've got some stuff, and I don't know whether they want to give it up or not. Now, I just don't know.
And you don't know what is included in the their collection?
No, because I told you that little anecdote about Carl Van Vechten.
You didn't finish that.
Yes, I did. I said that... Well now, wait a minute. What is there I think somebody wrote me once, some scholar.
All you need to do is write the letter that asks them to send a list of the items in their file of your work.
I've got it, I've got it. You're not going to believe this, there is no way that you'll believe this. I hate houses, I hate cars, I hate everything. All right.
Except writing.
Except writing. And my house was falling apart. I had to do^something. So that therefore, I began working on my house, and I m alone in that house. My point is, I made the mistake of telling the first man that I wanted every room done in the whole house. So that therefore, he did this room, got bored with this, and did that room, and got bored with that. So my stuff is just everywhere.
You probably need a couple of graduate students to help work with it.﻿17
DW: Yes, but it's just... And I have gotten very discouraged, because
I didn't know where my stuff was. When I was	in Russia, I kept a
diary, and I can't make up my mind whether to	tear up the diary, throw the diary away or not, but the writer in me won't let me tear up the diary.
GG: No, you'd better not. Were you in Russia the same time that Langston Hughes was there?
DW: My dear, yes. There was quite a little of us.
GG: Really?
DW: Yes. Because I have some charming stories about Langston. Oh, I
mean the diary particularly. This is just a little aside. You had a norm, you got so much a day, you know—I mean, from the food store. Langston liked red caviar, and I liked black. And sometimes we would meet on the street, and Langston would give me his black caviar, and I would... And I have a telegram from Langston that—I don't know whether I gave it to Boston University or not. It doesn't mean anything to anybody much, but I'm very sentimental about it. I just came across it. It said, "Bring back lemons." I was in Latvia, and Langston was in Russia, in Moscow. This was years ago when America had not recognized Russia, and I was in Latvia renewing my American— what do you call it—passport or something, and Langston wrote me, asking me to bring back some lemons. And I remember that I, I couldn't eat. Because when I left for Latvia, I said, "I'm going to eat"—this is typical of me—I was going to eat this and that and the other. Well, when I got to Latvia, I couldn't eat because they weren't eating it, and I just couldn't So every morning I was going to eat eggs and bacon, and so forth and so on, but I couldn t.
GG: You mean the people who did not have that food...
DW: Well, no. I know that Langston couldn't eat it, and the others weren't eating it, and I just couldn't. I just didn't have the appetite for it. I think I remember why I couldn't eat it, because I just couldn't eat it knowing that they were not eating it. Do you know what kasha is?
GG: Yes.
DW: That's what you had. [laughter]
GG: Sort of boring...kind of cereal.
DW: Oh, my God. [laughs]
GG: Well, now, Dorothy, you always talk about the fact that people keep coming to interview you because you...
DW: 'Cause I'm the oldest? No, because I'm the oldest living person...﻿18
GG
...who was affiliated or involved with the Harlem Renaissance.
DW: That's right.
DW:
GG: So why don't you tell us a little bit about what it was like?
DW: Yes, I even brought some notes, but I don't know what they are. What the Harlem Renaissance was like?
GG: Because we've recently gone through a renaissance in black literature, and I know the Harlem Renaissance was very different.
DW: All right.
GG: So it's that difference...
You must remember, though, because I said this to Boston University, because they've asked we what the Harlem Renaissance... You must remember that we did not know there was a renaissance. All right. If you want me to start personally with myself, my cousin and I, she wrote poetry and I wrote short stories.
GG: Okay, now when. DW:
But the Opportunity magazine... This is in the twenties, the late twenties. For the Opportunity magazine, they had contests. And we submitted, Helen submitted a poem, and I submitted a short story, and Zora Neale Hurston is involved in this too. I didn t know Zora that well, but I was seventeen and Zora was twenty-five; my only point in saying that is, Zora loved me, but she always had a little feeling about me, because I was only seventeen and she was twenty five, and so forth and so on. But at any rate, then you got the invitation from Opportunity to attend their dinner.
GG: The Opportunity...
DW: They had a dinner, the award dinner. And we were very excited, and I mean, I appreciate mothers, because... Mothers go through a great deal. Here we are, eager, seventeen and eighteen, and she said, "But that doesn't mean that you won." "But why would they send us an invitation?" And she said, "Dorothy, they send invitations to everybody." We were fortunate... Because I know my mother now. 1 mean, I know that she was dying. Well, that's another long story about my mother, but at any rate...
GG: Well, we'll get to that later. But now stay...
DW: Yes. But at any rate, so that therefore, they let us go. And to _
my surprise, we did, we won—I mean, I won, I split second prize with Zora Neale Hurston. And Helen won first honorable mention for her poem.
GG: Do you remember the name of the story for which you won the award?
DW: "The Typewriter."﻿19
GG:	And this was about 1927?
DW:	This was just about '27.
GG:	And your cousin's poem, you don't remember the name of that?
DW:	No. But I may have the magazine with her...
GG:	Oh, you do?
[break]
GG: I think other people's approach to an interview may be to come and say, "This is Genii Guinier, and I'm here in Martha's Vineyard on this lovely but rainy day, and I'm interviewing Miss Dorothy West, who is a writer and has been on this island for many, many years. Now, Dorothy West, would you like to tell us a little bit about your life."
DW: That's marvelous, that's marvelous.
GG:
DW:
DW: GG: DW:
But you know that isn't my approach, 'cause I think that an interview. . .
No, 'cause I'm sure that's why I liked you when I met you last year, and so forth.
GG: Well, thank you. I appreciate whatever compliments you have to offer. [laughter] Now, you were saying that your mother...
Oh, yes, all right. ...wanted to ease the pain...
Well, first of all, I was going to tell you about being seventeen and a half. So they wrote me and asked me for my little autobiography... And the reason I said seventeen and a half, I was so proud to be a half, you know, not just seventeen. And I know my beautiful mother took me aside and said to me, "Dorothy, I know you are only seventeen and a half, and that's very young. But what you don't realize is"—that smart woman—"the date of the magazine is on the magazine. So that everybody who can count..." [laughter] There, that's number one. So I never told my age. Then, my cousin Helen, who was the same as my sister, one day she came to me and she said, "Dorothy, how old..." My birthday. And I said, "Don't be foolish." And she said, "No, how old are you?" And I said... So we quarreled about... She said, "I'm going to keep asking you until you tell me." And I said, "I'm twenty-one." And she said, "No, you're not, 'cause I'm not twenty-one years old yet." So, never tell your age until you... So there were those two things. I never told my age. As I told you, now you get older, you say, "Well, I'll tell them,what the heck." But at any rate...﻿20
GG: For whatever it's worth to you, Shirley DuBois and I sat in this very same room, and Shirley never announced how old she was. So I was busy telling my daughter, "Please watch her when she crosses the street." 'Cause I was putting Shirley DuBois maybe ten years below Dr. DuBois, you know. I mean, I knew she looked very agile, and it was very easy for her to get around, but I was just picturing her close to eighty, or in her seventies. Well, it wasn't till after she died that I found out she was in her sixties, and my daughters turned around and said to me, "I was taking such good care of her, holding her arm, doing this and doing that." I said, "That's all right, she was entitled to that."
DW: But let me tell you, years ago—when I say years ago, I was maybe ten or more years younger—I was with a friend who was my age, who had a young person there with her. I was going down her back stairs, and I was making my little joke, you know, "I've got to be careful going down these stairs." And all of a sudden I felt this^young hand on my arm, and she was guiding me down the stairs. I'll never forget that as long as I live, because I didn't feel old, but to her I was old.
GG: But she heard you say that.
DW: Yes. And I'll never forget that as long as... I remember when I
used to jump up and give seats to older people. And then all of a^ sudden, one day I said, "What am I jumping up for, I'm old myself, [laughter]
GG: Well, you know, that is true. You do not see yourself in this category. Because last year when I was teaching, the students would make wisecracks, "You mean you really play tennis?
DW: Oh, for God's sake. You look like you can play tennis! They make
you... My mother would say, "Young people make you sick." [laughs]
GG: DW:
Okay, so let's get back to the Renaissance.
Oh, all right. It was about that time I met Carl Van Vechten. I lived in a house. This is just a little aside. And Carl Van Vechten, he was a very rich man, and he lived in a beautiful apartment, and a friend of my mother's took us to see Carl Van Vechten and to his apartment building. And we saw the apartment door. We couldn t figure out—isn't that interesting—I*d never seen an apartment. We couldn't figure out how he could live in one room. We just couldn t figure it out. Well, my point is, that's the first apartment we had ever been in in our lives. And then the door opened, and here was this great big enormous thing, and we were very young. We sat down and landed [laughs] in the same chair, and then looked... Oh, my God. See, what we wanted to do was just sit down quick and be xncon spicuous. Oh, my God. We both sat down in the... And she, my beautiful cousin—I don't mean she was physically beautiful. Well, she had my mother's complexion, very pink. And I can see her now, she was so pink. We got so embarrassed. There we were, and they tried not to laugh, but here we were, two...﻿21
GG: And you stayed there the whole time?
DW: No, I guess one of us eased up and went to another chair. When you're young, you're so...young. All right. So that therefore, then we got very excited, and my mother let us go. We were supposed to go to Columbia. We were very poor, so we didn't have much money, but anyway...
GG: Well, wait. What's the connection between your going and Carl Van Vechten?
DW: Oh, well, the reason we went to see Carl Van Vechten was because he was very much involved in the... Carl had written—what is it?— Nigger Heaven?
GG: I don't know whether he's written it. Possibly.
DW: I think he had.
GG: We can check that out.
DW: Do you know Nigger Heaven?
GG: I don't know the book, no.
DW: Oh. Because there was rich black woman, Alelia Walker.
GG: Oh, yes, I know her.
DW: Oh. Well, he wrote it about her. You didn't know that?
GG: I didn't know that.
DW: Yes. And my point is, Alelia Walker was a great friend of this woman who was a great friend of my mother's, a Bostonian who had moved to New York. Great beauty, and one thing and another. My point is that Alelia Walker was very friendly with Carl. She was the only one. I mean, everybody felt... Well, you know how people are. I really don't know. I mean, they thought it was shocking, and so forth and so on. The title, of course, offended them.
GG: Well, that's one of the reasons I never picked the book up.
DW: I'm sure I must have read it at some time or other. I'm sure I must have read it. But at any rate...
GG: So Carl Van Vechten... My understanding is that there were many white people who were sponsors of black writers during the Harlem Renaissance.
DW: Well, yes. 'Cause you want me to tell you a story about ny.self and Elizabeth Marbury? You don't know who she was. But she had a salon in Paris with Elsie De Wolfe. Do those names mean anything to you?﻿22
GG: No. What group was this again?
DW: Elizabeth Marbury and Elsie De Wolfe were Americans who went to
Paris, and they were involved with literary matter, and they had a salon... They were well-to-do women. And the Ernest Hemingways, and the Fitzgeralds, and all that would come...
GG: These were the people who came through this salon in France?
DW: Yes. Then Elizabeth Marbury came back to America—do you know Sutton Place in New York?
GG: Yes, I do.
DW: She started the whole Sutton Place development. And that was the period when I knew her—and this is just a little aside. I have told this story to Boston University. It amuses them. She had five servants, all English, and you had to go through them to get to her. They had the lovely English accents, and when you got to her, she was booming in an American voice, and so forth and so on and so on. So she was really quite a character. This is interesting. You know Amos and Andy, who they were?
GG: Yes, ma'am.
DW: All right. So that therefore, she wanted to meet a group of my friends. So I took Wallace Thurman, oh, I don't know, a half dozen others. And we went there, and we didn't—it's interesting —we didn't quite know what to do, because it was seven o'clock and she said that she wanted to turn on "Amos 'n' Andy." She turned on "Amos 'n' Andy," and we had to sit there and listen, and we didn't know what to do about it. All right. But the reason I bring in Wallace Thurman is, then I had an occasion to see her maybe a week or two later after that visit. She was delighted with her... And I never will forget, she said to me, "Dorothy, do you know one of the things I like"—oh, she was seventy years old—"the things I like best about you?" Or something like that. And I thought she was going to talk about my great talent. She said, "You have known me for two years, and you know that I am a very rich woman, and you have never asked me for any money." Wallace Thurman had met her once, had written her the next day to ask her for five hundred dollars, and she gave him the five hundred dollars—and that's a lot of money in those days—and he wrote Infants of the Spring, in which my cousin and I figure as two little girls in Boston, and one thing and another. But I never forgave him for that. Because I'm not a beggar, and she knew that I was a poor young writer. But I had an art
___what did she want me to do, crawl? But at any rate, that was what
she liked best about me, that I had never... But, I told you about the beautiful—and I'm not being funny, I think I told you this— about the people at the News? Captains of the—you know, the Patterson McCormack people?
GG: Well, I think you started that. Why don't you refresh my memory?﻿23
DW: All right. They had something called Blue Ribbon Fiction— Sunday stories—and then stuff at the end of them. But they liked...it was a black story. I think that was the one and only black story they ever printed. And I didn't send it to them.
GG: Did you use Dorothy West as your name?
DW: Yes.
GG: And they knew you were black?
DW: Oh, yes. It was a black story. Well, see, the point was, I wrote it for a contest, and the magazine forwarded it. I had an agent, and so that, therefore, my agent sent it... I mean, it would never have occurred to me to send it to the News. He sent it to them for their Blue Ribbon Fiction. I wish I had the original, because I remember that I had to cut it. But as I say to myself, I learned a great deal at the News. I learned to cut. He sent me a telegram in which he said, "The Daily News will take this story if you will cut it to five thousand words," and I did.
GG: What was the name of that story?
DW: Wait a minute. "The Jackpot." Now that story's been picked up by a couple of...
GG: Oh, that's in one of the anthologies, I think.
DW: Yes. So I wrote that. And then one day they called me up, or
wrote me—I don't remember—and asked me to come in and see them. And I will always be grateful to Katherine Kelly—she was an Irishwoman, I believe—because they told me that there was no more Blue Ribbon Fiction, and there was the daily short story. And they said, "It's just...not an important paper."
GG: Now when was this, about?
DW: This was quite a bit later, maybe... It's 1940 that they accepted "The Jackpot." But that kept my writing hand in, because all of my friends were so contemptuous—you know how people are—that I wrote for the News. But it was keeping me eating.
GG: What did they pay you for "The Jackpot?"
DW: Oh, "The Jackpot"? Well, now, this may not seem like much to you? I got four hundred dollars. Let me tell you what I did with it. I got four hundred dollars, and I told somebody that I got four hundred dollars, somebody who knows about this. And they were so surprised, and I remember they said, "Who's your agent?" And I said, "George Bye." And they said, "Oh, that's why you got four hundred dollars." Because George Bye had me in his stable. But he had Eleanor Roosevelt and I mean, a lot of famous people. He was one of the best agents in New York. And I got him through﻿24
DW: (cont.) Fannie Hurst. Do you know Zora Neale Hurston? This is just a little thing. Well, at any rate, Zora got a grant to go someplace. That's when she played that trick. I'm glad that they appreciate her now, because my eyes can sometimes fill with tears about Zora, because she was a very gifted person.
GG: You know what? The thought occurred to me as you were talking then. We have to get together again and just talk a little bit about Zora Neale Hurston, because...but not today.
DW: No, but may I tell you something about Zora? Do you know there's a book out on Zora? All right. I will tell you, that's why I was a little cautious about Harvard University, because about three years ago, that's only my laxity... This young man heard—of course, I have no doubts—that I knew Zora Neale Hurston.
GG: So he came to interview...
DW: Well, he wrote me, and asked me if I would... He sent me a beautiful chapter—the man is a gifted writer—he sent me a beautiful chapter to show me how well he could write, and he asked me to tell him... He knew that I knew her personally, and one thing and another, and I think I wrote him that I will when I get time, and so forth and so on, but I never did. All right. Then, he probably wrote me, we probably corresponded two or three times. Then I went to Boston University about two or three years ago, and Adelaide Gulliver said to me, "Dorothy, this young girl wants to take you to lunch and ask you about Zora Neale Hurston." So it was kind of fun, she was a little girl, and I paid for the lunch. You know, I said, "I can't let a young girl pay for my lunch." But anyway, the point is that she wanted to know about Zora because she wanted to do a paper on Zora, and this man—his name is Hemenway, Robert Hemenway, is the man. And he's got excellent reviews on this book. Except that they said there wasn't much about her personal life, and I guess... All right. But the point is, he tied up her papers. He has tied up Zora Neale's, so nobody has access to Zora's papers. And I didn't want to do that. I mean, that just stuck in my mind. This little girl was asking me questions because nobody can have any access because...
GG: He tied it up.
DW: Yes.
GG: Well, get back, though, to what you were saying, that it was Zora Neale Hurston who introduced you to George Bye.
DW: No. Zora Neale Hurston introduced me to Fannie Hurst. Do you remember who Fannie Hurst was?
GG: Yes.
All right, a very rich woman.﻿25
GG: She also wrote.
DW: Oh my, yes. Because let me tell you, uy first... I admired her before 1 ever met her, and when I was fourteen yours old...'cause I'll tell you this story, I wrote a story and sent it to Cosmopolitan. And I hope I have Ray Long's letter, because he wrote me the most scathing letter. You know how you...I copied it. I wrote about Jewish people, and I used the language and whatnot. You know how you do. When you're painting, you paint...all right.
GG: What you hear, or what you see.
DW: That's right. And so he wrote me the most scathing...me...fourteen years old. He said, "I know that you are a forty-year-old spinster who's..." so forth and so on. And I suppose in a way I wrote pretty good, because he didn't know it was a poor little old fourteen-year-old girl, writing in longhand.
GG: So Fannie Hurst, what did she do?
DW: All right. I don't know whether this is generally known, but this is just a little something, 'cause it kind of hurt me. So Zora went away, as you know, and one day Fannie Hurst called me. By that time I'd met Fannie Hurst.
GG: She knew who you were, and...
DW: Yes, and through her I'd met Elizabeth Marbury. But when I say this, when I said it hurt me a little bit, simply because—I did not know this—she asked me if I would come over, and she was having a party. Oh, maybe she didn't know Zora... Would I help her the way Zora had helped her? And my point is, evidently Zora had gone over and worked for her. Fannie Hurst and Carl Van Vechten used to have parties and invite Zora to entertain. Do you know what I mean? She told those wonderful stories of hers. I always resented it, I always resented this, you see. And I knew that she did that. But I didn't also know that sometimes she went over to Fannie Hurst's and put on an apron. But then, don't forget, that was Zora's background. It was not my background.
GG: And that meant that maybe Zora was doing it for a little extra income?
DW: Oh, yes, of course. Yes, 'cause you know, want me to tell you about Zora and my fur coat?
GG: Your fur coat? Yes, I do.
DW: I brought back a fur coat from Russia, and then I came back here, and I left my things in Zora's—
GG: Where was Zora's apartment?﻿26
DW: In New York. And I left my things in Zora's. Zora had little storage place. And when I came back, the place had been broken into. I didn't care about the fur coat, but all of my papers... Well, now, maybe I'm just making this up. I think Zora—because she always was going to buy me a fur coat—I think Zora needed money, and I think she staged the robbery, and took my little fur coat. I have the feeling that she did. Because she never stopped talking about the fur coat, and how she was going to buy me a fur coat. Which, of course, she never did. And I didn't care, because it wasn't the fur coat that I cared about. I don't mean it was staged. I mean, it was...you know, all this...and the fur coat gone, you see. Did you want to know something else about Zora?
GG: Well, the conversation about Zora, I think, ought to be at a separate time. What I'm trying to get is a picture of your involvement, your recollection of the Harlem Renaissance.
DW; All right. So now the...
GG: Because the role of the white people like Fannie Hurst, and Carl Van Vechten, and some of the others have been documented, but what I think would be interesting would be, perhaps, depending on what you think, the reaction, or the involvement of the black writers, like Langston Hughes, and yourself, and Zora Neale Hurston.
DW: All right. Did you read...the book came out, and I read it some years ago...
GG: Johnson's book?
DW: No, not Johnson's. Oh, wait a minute, I have his name here. It began to be everybody's bible. I didn't buy it. A kid, one of the young people at Boston University, bought and sent it to me. All of a sudden I said, "Oh, my God, I've got to pay this girl ..." I quarreled with a lot that he said. Wait a minute, what's his name? I just want to find his name. Alain Locke—you know Alain Locke, won't you?
GG:	Yes. Oh, it wasn't a white writer?
DW:	Who?
GG;	Wasn't it?
DW:	No, no, this is a black man.
GG:	Are you sure?
DW:	I'm pretty sure he's black. How where is he? Oh God, I thought I looked at him just —
GG: Take your time. We have nothing but time right now.﻿27
DW: All right. Isn't it Monroe Trotter?
GG: Was it Monroe Trotter?
DW: No, no, no. I just, I had a little note about Monroe Trotter,
because we were... Oh, Monroe Trotter and Booker T. Washington... because I always despised Booker T. Washington, because Monroe Trotter was a family friend. And in those days, Booker T. Washington and Monroe used to have debates.
GG: Well, wait, now. Don't get lost on... I'll make a note of that, and we'll come back to it, but...
DW: Oh, really? Oh, all right.
GG: What about this author you were very...
DW: Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't understand that, because...
GG: Well, take your time.
DW: What was the name of his book? His book came out three or four years ago, and everybody was reading it madly. He became the bible, and I quarreled with everything he said. I went to Boston University on this particular occasion, and I... Oh, golly. I'll tell you the next time I see you, because indeed I have his book.
GG: There was one book written—wait, Bone, Robert Bone.
DW: Nope.
GG: Oh. 'Cause see, I remembered his book was severely criticized. This was a white writer.
DW: Oh, I think, I'm pretty...I know this man was black. Because it seems to me that his picture...
GG: What else did he do? Did he do anything else?
DW: Well, he wrote about the...this man? He's a scholar. He wrote about the Harlem...
GG: Oh, Higgins. Huggins, Huggins, Nathan Irvin Huggins.
DW: Yes. I quarreled with everything Huggins said. He don't know
nothin'. You know how you say, he should have asked me. I could have told... My mother, that's what my mother used to say. "He should have asked me. I would have told him better than that." [laughter] He should have asked, he didn't know I was in on that. But I mean, he... There was some misinformation, there was some misinformation.
GG: Well, later on I'll tell you a little inside story of Nathan
Huggins. My husband also couldn't tell where he was coming from.﻿28
GG: (cont.) Okay. Now, there were some things in his book that you disagreed with?
DW: Yes.
GG: But see, if people like yourself don't get down what it was really like...
DW: All right, I understand.
GG: ___these folks are going to go out there and make it up, if
necessary. Or they will just go to the resources available.
DW: Oh, wait a minute. I know why I quarreled with Huggins. Because he mentioned her name very often. He got his information from Louise...what was Louise...Patterson. All right.
GG: Really?
DW: Do you know Louise Patterson?
GG: Yes, I know Louise Patterson.
DW: Ah. Isn't that interesting. Wallace Thurman was one of my good friends. I'll tell you a little something about Wally and me. Wallace Thurman was one of my good friends, and Louise... I ve forgotten her last name. Patterson, I guess, and... Now I don't know. Patterson was the man that she married in the end. Do you remember Patterson? He was a Communist, wasn't he?
GG: William Patterson.
DW: All right. I think he died in Paris or something?
GG: No, he's still alive.
Oh, I thought I read...
GG: No, he's still alive. He's not...
DW: Well, then, maybe that's not...is that Louise's husband?
GG: Louise Patterson is Mrs. William Patterson. If Louise Patterson is the one... You sure it was Louise Patterson that he got his information from?
DW: Well, wait a minute. Do you know what Louise Patterson looks like?
GG: Yes.
°W: All right, she's short and fair.
GG: Yes.﻿29
DW: All right. That's Louise. Well, Louise came to New York with a great big mother—I don't know why, a little bitty woman like her. And her mother didn't care who she married, so long as she married somebody who was in the arts, let us say. And so that therefore, Louise married Wally and we all went crazy, because we said, "It'll never work," and so forth and so on and so on. And I was in the middle—I don't know why—because Wally used to come to me and tell me his story, and one thing and another. And Louise worked in the... I can never forget, 'cause I didn't smoke then, and Louise worked in... I lived on—where the devil was I living? Someplace downtown, I guess. So Louise would come on her lunch hour into my little apartment, Sixty-sixth Street, and drink coffee and smoke cigarettes. And I mean, she was a chain smoker, and I mean, it just fascinated me that anybody could... Louise liked me better than I liked her.
Well, you'll have to know a little something about me. Well, you do know this. I think it's because of my background. They knew that I came from Boston. They knew that, how I'd been brought up. So that therefore, they expected me to be a little bit different. Do you understand what I mean? And I think I have certain conservative—not conservative views, but... And then I was young, you see. And probably a virgin at this time. So that Louise used to come and talk to to me about her relationship with Wally, and finally they did get a divorce. She was quite out of tune. I know why she came to me, because I was the only one who had any sympathy for her, you see.
But at any rate, I don't know why Huggins got so much information from Louise. Because she was the last person, r,he was totally outside the Renaissance. Well, you know what I mean, she was married to Wally, and nobody liked her. I don't know how long they stayed married—not long, you see. So that's where he got...
GG: Well, of course, he might not have gotten it orally, verbally,
from her, but she might have led him to some information. But, all right. So you disagree with his view of the Renaissance. Now, can you give us a clearer picture of what the Renaissance was like? You said at the beginning you didn't know it was a Renaissance.
DW: No, nobody knew. That's why I brought in the Opportunity contest. Because so many of them were drawn to New York because there were these contests. Well, look. You go to New York when you're young. Do you know Harry T. Burleigh, the composer? All right. He used to be on this island, and he...
GG: What, on Martha's Vineyard?
DW: He used to come every summer.
GG: Where did he stay when he was here?
^W: oh, at Shearer Cottage. Because we have a picture of him in one of the family albums, which I like very much, because it says,﻿30
DW: (cont.) "HTB, the children's friend." Because it was not HTB,
the composer. Because we were kids—ten, and so forth and so on. He used to give us money to go to the movies. But my point in saying that is, he used to talk to us about New York, and we used to call it "the magic city." And one day we wanted to go to the magic city. And my point is, I think, all over the country there were these young people who wanted to go to the magic city.
GG: Okay, So what brought them there? I mean, how did they get there, financially?
DW: Don't forget, one is very young. I went to Europe twice with twenty dollars. You were young, and...
GG: There were ways that you could get to places with very little money?
DW: Well, I don't know, because I had been asked that question at
Boston University by these young people, and I said, "You don't understand. My dinner was to go to Nedicks and get a frankfurter and pineapple juice." And as I tell them, if I was very hungry, I got two frankfurters. When you are young and full of hope, seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen—I guess I was half the size I am now. But it doesn't bother you, you see, because now...
Oh, I'll tell you about Wally Thurman. He knew a woman—I've for gotten her name, but it's easy to find out her name, I dare say— who had great respect for Wally because he was an educated black person. So that therefore, she had started selling chitlings, or whatever, on the street. This was a shrewd woman, and so she had bought apartments, she had bought buildings, and she gave Wally, gave him a free loft at the top of one of her buildings, and that's where we went. I mean, we gathered there. Except for Countee Cullen. Countee was above the mob, you see. And Carl Van Vechten, he was very fond of me—he was twenty years older than I was—he was very fond of me. And I must say, although I did not realize that then, much that I have learned, I learned from Carl. Because he called the young people of the Harlem Renaissance, he used to call them "your friends with the fat souls.'
GG: "Your friends with the fat souls."
DW: With the fat souls. With the fat souls—I've forgotten. That's what Carl... Because he would want me to come to his house, and I would say, well, I've got to go here, and I've got to go there. But my point is, we would meet at Wally's. And you didn't have much to eat. You gave rent parties. But I was always too proud to give a rent party. And I have to say a little something: I was getting a little support from my father. I had a silver dollar, and I remember, one day Helen and I, we spent our silver dollar. But you could buy...we bought quite a little food.
GG: Like what?﻿31
DW: I don't know. You could buy ten cents' worth of hamburg...well, ten cents' worth of bologna...don't forget, these were kids. And you could buy a five-cent box of crackers, and I guess you could get cupcakes for three cents, two cupcakes for six cents, and so forth and so on. I don't think food was that... I tell you, I had a little apartment, and I've never understood why... I'm a milk drinker, as you know. I always had a pint of milk—I don't think it was a quart—it was a glass bottle; I think it was a pint of milk, and a quarter of a pound of butter. I don't know what the devil I had the butter for, 'cause I had no bread, I had no nothin'. But that was unimportant. We were writers. But now, if you opened my icebox and it isn't practically full, I'm embarrassed. But in those days, I mean you know, none of us had anything. You know the rent parties, don't you?
GG: Yes, I do. Langston Hughes writes a lot about rent parties.
DW: Yes. And they really did. But, I mean, it was a point of pride with me never to give a rent party, you see.
GG: 'Cause you were a Bostonian.
DW: I guess so. [laughter]
GG: Well, let's see. The Opportunity magazine...
DW: Oh, let me tell you. You haven't heard this. All right. I told you I got a little help from my father. The Theater Guild, I wrote to them. In those days, you're young, and so forth and so on. So I asked them if they had a job. What in the devil, I didn't want to be an actress. What did I want to do? But at any rate, I was a cute little girl in those days, and they sent for me. They had no office job, let me say, but they let me be a "super" in--nobody realizes, nobody knows what I'm talking about when I say this—but I was in the original Porgy as a supernumerary.
GG: Oh, really?
DW: The original Porgy was a stage play, a drama. All right. But my point in telling you that is, so I got a little seventeen dollars and a half. Now I'll tell you about...
GG: What did you do in Porgy?
DW: I was a supernumerary. And what I did in Porgy was... Reuben Mamoulian was the director, and he was called the boy genius of Broadway. And many things that you see now, Reuben Mamoulian started. And Cheryl Crawford was the director. She's on the television a lot. She has a book out. At that time in Porgy Cheryl Crawford was the assistant stage director. She would stand in the wings with a baton, and...one, two, three, four. And I was on the edge of the stage with a pail. I would drop the pail. One, two three, four. There was a boy sleeping on the stage. When I made the fourth thing, he would wake up and say something to me.﻿32
DU: (cont.) His voice would alert the woman upstairs, who was one
of the real actors—he and I were little supers—[she] would open the window, and the play would begin. And I say this because one night I forgot to come downstairs, and the boy had to wake up by himself and talk to himself. [laughter] Oh, God. I was always dreaming. And you see, this was the Republic Theater, and the dressing rooms were little things up on the fourth floor. I flew downstairs, but by the time I got downstairs, the play had...
GG: The play had already begun.
DW: The play had begun. That was the only time I did that, though.
But the reason I told you about that is because they knew that I was getting a little money from him. So that when I got my little seventeen and a half dollars, I gave it all away. I was supposed to be lending it, but I mean...you know. They knew that every Saturday, or whatever, Dorothy got seventeen dollars. And Wally Thurman, the young man that I told you about, Wally Thurman was writing the play, Harlem. Well, at any rate, my point is, Wally was in the thing, too, because we were a little group. We were totally obnoxious. We were a little group of four little writers who stuck together and everybody hated us. They particularly hated me because I had a Boston accent. But in the end everybody loved me.
GG: Okay. That's Wally Thurman, Dorothy West...
DW: Dorothy West, Bruce Nugent, and another man who—oh, God, I've
forgotten, he's dead now. And they disliked us. Well, it doesn't make any difference.
GG: All right, now. These four writers stuck together...
DW: In the play, little play. And then Wally decided that we weren't getting enough money, and so he stuck his neck out, and they did raise our salary. But they fired him. But that's all right.
I did a little social work once and... You know the great big municipal hi.ion, the State, County and Municipal Workers—the social workers? I was one of five people—this is uany, many years ago—and I think there were three hundred people in the office, and we had no organization, none. And so I was one of the five people who sat in, marched'round with our little placards. We knew we were going to lose our jobs, but we didn't. But I always feel a little bit proud of our efforts.
GG: What was it that you were asking for at that time?
DW: Well, we were making twenty-three dollars a week. See, these
salaries are unbelievable. But what you see...when you ask us how we lived, this is long ago. I had a little maid. I had a woman —I couldn't cook. I must admit, I was sharing a flat with somebody. But we had a woman who used to come in and cook, a woman on relief. She—that was her little extra—used to come in and cook every other day.﻿33
GG: This was during the depression, then.
DW: Well, there was always a depression. Let's see. This was in the thirties.
GG: Thirties.
DW: Yes, the late thirties, or something like that. Yes. About the late thirties. The middle to late thirties.
GG: Well, you know, it's interesting that there was this revival of
interest in culture. Today when you ask people what it is that's giving them support or encouragement, you rarely get the feeling that there's anything other than individual support. Like a mother might give support, or...I don't mean financial support.
DW: No, no, I know.
GG: There was a period in the Renaissance...
DW: There will never be a renaissance... That was a beautiful, I'm glad I was part of that Renaissance.
GG: Yes, well, see, it's that flavor that I'm trying to get a feel for.
DW: Because I really mean this. The only people on the outside were Langston... Countee Cullen was into Harvard; he was a Phi Beta Kappa, and he lived with his father in New York. His father was a minister.
GG: He was originally from the Islands, wasn't he? Oh, no, Claude, Claude McKay was from the Islands.
DW: Yes. And Claude, he was older than everybody, and Claude had lived
abroad. And then he called my friends "your friends with fat souls," so that he was a separate...but the rest of us were all together. And Countee used to pull me one way, Claude used to pull me another way. Countee wanted to marry me because he wanted to go teach and one thing, and he thought I would make a good wife, and liked my singing, and so forth and so on. But the rest of us, we all stuck together. See, there was that little...
GG: Who?
DW: Well, I don't know, I...well, Wallace Thurman died. Did you want me to tell you about Wally, the last bit about Wally?
GG: Okay.
DW: Never mind, I won't tell you. You didn't sound very interested.
GG: Well, no. I don't know what...﻿34
DW: Well, no, no, no. The point is, when you asked me how many people. Wallace Thurman died, and as I said, we all went to his funeral. Let us say there were sixteen or seventeen, and that was the end. This is what I mean when I say this, to me, that was the end of the Harlem Renaissance, the day that we went to Wally's funeral.
GG: Well, that sounds very important, and that sounds...
DW: All right. Well, then, I will tell you about Wally. Wally was
very fond of me. Now this, I'm just going to give you this story as he said it to me. I told you that Wally went to Hollywood, or maybe I didn't.
GG: Not this time.
DW: All right. He had written a play called... I am winding down. But after this...
GG: You are? All right, well, then maybe we'll do it another day.
DW: No, I'll finish this little story. Wally had written a play,
Harlem. I think that was when he got noticed. He had written a play, Harlem, and Isabel Powell was in it and did a very good job, a beautiful job. Well, at any rate, then Wally got some notice, and he received a contract to go to Hollywood. And my point being —you can understand and be amused by it—we all said, "He's gonna write big movies." My point is, instead of saying, "Hurrah, rah, rah," we all said, "What's that? He's only going to do big movies." [laughter]
GG: They won't let him write, anything other than Hollywood movies.
DW: Yes, we were jealous, in other words. I wasn't jealous, because
you know... So then Wally went to Hollywood, and I went to Europe with Langston—I mean, in that group. All right. And then, I'm only going to tell you so much, 'cause I only tell so much of a story, 'cause I have a friend who used to say to me, "Dorothy, you never finish a story. You never tell the whole story." All right. I was in Harlem. It's a beautiful sunny... I had come back from Europe, I had been in Boston, and now I was in New York, getting ready to do the magazine—do you know about the magazine, New Challenge?
GG: I know about...
DW: All right. I was getting ready to do those magazines, because now I was about twenty-five years old, and I felt old. I felt that I would encourage the young people, and so forth and so on. But somebody said, "But you were young at twenty-five." And I said, "Yes, but don't forget, I began when I was seventeen and a half." So, all right. So that therefore, I was on one side of the street and Wally was on the other side. And I screamed. I loved Wally. And I said, "Wally," and I ran across the street. He had the most beautiful laugh in the world. You'll see why I'm saying﻿35
DW: (cont.) that. He had the most beautiful laugh in the world, the most beautiful voice, and I ran across the street and threw myself into his arms. And I said, "Wally, what are you doing in New York?" and one thing and another. And I remember that he laughed, and it was bitter. And he said, "I heard about you in Russia." I remember saying to myself, "There is nothing I can say to him, because he was not there." And so then he said to me, and I felt this was unfair, "You were the only thing I believed in, and now I don't believe in you." And then I said, "What are you doing in New York?" And he said he was in Hollywood lying around on the beaches, he was never the strongest person in the world, and now he is ill. And he said, "My doctor has sent me..." I wrote a piece, and I never put this in the piece, that piece that started all this. But at any rate, he said, "My doctors told me to come to New York, and I'm not supposed to drink any more," he said, "but now I don't care. I don't care if I die or not. Let's buy some liquor and get drunk." So, this was this beautiful bright day. So we went to the liquor store and we bought liquor—I used to drink in those days—and we went to his apartment. He had kept his apartment. We went to his apartment, and we began to drink. I didn't get... The reason I drank in those days... I don't get drunk. I couldn't...
GG: No, I thought you just poured it down the sink or something.
DW: No, I was the strongest, healthiest person in the world. Many people didn't believe I drank, you see. That's when I stopped drinking, when I reacted. The drink made me feel good, but it didn't have any physical effect on me. Do you understand? Well, at any rate, I tell you this story because this was the end for me, the end of the Harlem Renaissance. Then we began to call up people, the Harlem people, and so they all came into Wally's apartment. There were all of them, with, I'm sure, the exception of Countee, if he were around, and of Claude, you see. And at two o'clock in the morning Wally hemorrhaged. They called the ambulance, and he went to Welfare Island. And the irony of that is, Wally had been in the hated Welfare Island. And his movie was about Welfare Island and the horror of it.
GG: You mean, they took him to Welfare Island to the emergency hospital?
DW: That's right. And then he had consumption.
GG: 'Cause I remember Welfare Island.
DW: I never saw it. But I mean, evidently the conditions there were deplorable.
GG: Right.
DW: And so, I was in my little apartment... Oh, so then I wrote Wally. A friend said to me—well I cannot explain why—but he said to me,﻿36
DW: (cont.) "Have you seen Wally?" And I said, "No, I'm going."
But I didn't, I did not go. And then one day—I didn't like hospitals. I don't know. When you're young, you're cruel and selfish and hard.
GG: And you don't want to be uncomfortable.
DW: You don't want to be uncomfortable. Therefore, I wrote Wally a gay little note. "Wally, I'm starting the..."
GG: The Challenge?
DW: The Challenge. And I got his letter, and I opened it. I was sitting in the chair by the window. And I opened the letter, and it said, "Dear child." I mean he had never called me dear child before. "Don't you know that I am dying?" And I dropped the letter on the floor. I couldn't bear it. And then I picked up the letter again. And the dear child meant...and my feeling was he is so far above us all now. Do you know what I'm saying? He is so far above us. And then he said, "The nurses don't know that I'm writing to you, 'cause I'm not supposed to write," and he wished me well. He couldn't write anything. I think I may have given that letter to— I thought I had destroyed the letter, but evidently I did not; and I cannot tell you now whether or not I gave it to Boston University or not. I cannot tell you. But at any rate, then Wally died. The day that we went to his house, that day to me was the last gathering. Because we all sort of scattered. That was the end of me. Oh, when I say that was the end of me, I was never... Well, I don't know. We called Wally our leader, maybe that was it. Our leader was now gone.
GG: Sure.
DW: That was it. Funny. I don't know why all of a sudden I realized why we broke up. Because Wally was...we literally called, not to his face, but we called him our leader. 'Cause he had a marvelous personality and he had the big room, and you brought your little gin there, and you brought your little crackers there, and you sat around and ate and talked about the great books, the great American novels you were gonna write, and the great poetry.
GG: Did you ever bring any of the material that you'd written to share with each other at this...
DW: I guess so. Don't forget, I was seventeen and a half, and so I was ignored. I was a woman. Because it's very interesting to me, because there are pictures. There was Zora Neale Hurston, there was myself, there was my cousin, there were... You were not as aware of it as I am... Oh, you remember I told you I wrote an article, and that's when... All right. There was a black magazine called New World or something, and they did a...
GG:
That's recently?﻿37
DW: No, no, no, this was seven years ago.
GG: Oh, yes. It was Black World.
DW: Black World. All right. And you paid no attention. That was the magazine in which my article appeared.
GG: First it was the Negro Digest.
DW: Oh, all right.
GG: No, no. Negro, it was something Negro. Maybe it was Negro Digest. And then it was titled...
DW: I think it was Black World. And that was the magazine in which my piece appeared that attracted the attention of Simmons College. But my point is, there was a picture on the cover; there were about six black male writers, not one woman. Not one woman.
GG: Isn't that interesting.
DW: And I think that's what happened.
GG: What year was that?
DW: That the article came out? I don't know. Gee whiz, must have
been...this is *78. It seems to me I filed the story...it was in the seventies. 'Cause I've only been going to Boston University about six years, I guess. I don't recall exactly, though.
GG: Well, I remember attending an institute in Cazenovia, New York, on "Black Excellence in American Literature," which was sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities.
DW: Oh, yes.
GG: And that was in 1969, summer of '69.
DW: Well, maybe it was, then.
GG: And they were then saying that there are some writers who should be better known, and one of them they mentioned was Zora Neale Hurston.
°W: Yes, my God.
GG: But they did not recommend or urge us to... Yes, I'm lying. They did. There were two of her books they recommended for us to read.
DW: Their Eyes Were Watching God.
GG= Their Eyes Were Watching God.
DW: And something else.﻿38
GG: Yes, that was one of them. But we never discussed it in class. You' right, the discussion focused around the men.
DW: Yes. Yes. Because my cousin Helen was a brilliant poet, and...
GG: What was Helen's last name?
DW: Johnson. Helene Johnson. Her name was really Helen. Helene Johnson. She was a pretty little thing. There was a magazine called Vanity Fair. And we used to play a lot. Oh, my God. We used to have meals together and play a lot. Only seventeen and eighteen. But at any rate. Frank Crowninshield was a white-haired man who was editor of Vanity Fair, and he printed a couple of her poems. He didn't know anything... He called her to see him, and he thought that she was a pretty little girl. And, I don't know what, but he propositioned her, I guess, and she came home frightened. So we both got down on our knees and prayed. We prayed a lot in those days.
DW: My father never knew that my mother's friends burned down the house. My mother had a house party. You don't know this, of course. You know where Our Market parking lot is?
GG: You're talking now about the Vineyard?
DW: No, no, in Oak Bluffs.
GG: Yes. Martha's Vineyard.
DW: Martha's Vineyard. There was a parking lot by Our Market. I have a postcard that was taken the day after the fire. There's nothing but rubble. And here are these people, you know, just sightseers, looking at the ruins. That was our house. Bessie Trotter and Bertha Baumann—you may not know her— but those were interesting women. Anyway, I think they were smoking—I know they were smoking —and a curtain caught fire, and the house burned down. So they saved the children. We children were on the top. It was a four-story house. But they saved us. The whole point of this story is, I woke up, looked up, saw the flames, put my head down on—who was it? I don't know. We had somebody who took care of us—and went to sleep. And so, I remember one day I was talking to Jimmy, it was a thousand years later. I was talking to Jimmy Coleman, and I said, "Jimmy, I don't know why I'm afraid of fire. Because..." and I told her. She knew the story. I said, "Because I remember waking up, looking at the fire, and putting my head down on the back of this lady's shoulder, somebody's shoulder, and going to sleep." She said, "Dorothy, you didn't go to sleep. You didn't want to look at the fire, and that's why you put your head down." I thought that the fire didn't affect me, because I looked at the flames. I can see them now. Oh!﻿39
GG: This is characteristic of childhood, that if you close your eyes, what you see disappears.
DW: Disappears. All right. But I didn't know that. I thought that
it meant that the fire meant nothing to me. I told you that little story because you said you don't know yet why I...
GG: Appear to be indifferent.
DW: Yes.
GG: Appear to be.
DW: That's what I mean. Because at that time, for forty years, I
guess, I took it for granted that I didn't care about the fire. Oh. The house that I lived in was our summer house, and then we used to stay later and later. And we got a stove. Every time my mother lit the fire, I went out to see what the night looked like. I thought I was. I went out to see if there was any smoke. And later on I said to myself, "Why the devil do I go out?" I didn't say anything to my mother. "Why do I go outdoors and look up at the sky?" I just fooled myself. I wasn't looking at the sky. I was looking at our roof. And then, I never said anything to her, but that's it. And that's why I was looking at the sky, to see if our house was on fire.
GG: That first fire had been really quite traumatic.
DW: Yes. Evidently it was. And all of my life I had said I was totally indifferent. I don't think I used the word indifferent, but I said it didn't bother me. But it did bother me. Oh, yes. We stopped at the point when I told you that my mother gave me that little quick look. Isn't that why I said that to you? All right. You'd don't look at yourself, you look at your family. And I think that that's why I have such an objection to pictures, because I know that I don't look like my family. But let me tell you this, I think I told you about my father's blue eyes?
GG: No, let me hear about your father's blue eyes.
DW: All right. My mother used to go out of her mind. I mean, she was so frustrated. My mother was beautiful. And I will say this about myself. I am "a nice person," because I do not say things like this to you when I am upset. All right, not to you. My mother. Sometimes I would say to my mother, "You wouldn't give me..." My father was a dark man with blue eyes, so therefore very arresting eyes. I would say to my mother, "You wouldn't give me your beauty, and you wouldn't give me my father's blue eyes." And she would say, "Oh, Dorothy, you're supposed to be the most sensible child in the family, and to hear you talk such foolishness." She would be horrified, because here I am, twenty-five years old, and there's no way for her to put me back in the womb and give me her beauty and my father's blue eyes.﻿40
GG: So in other words, surface appearance was very crucial. How a person, I mean, the color of a person's skin...
DW: Oh well, let me tell you this, because this has to do with the
middle class. And I want to make this perfectly clear. We had a dancing school, forty of Boston's best children. And I was the...
GG: Now, how old were you?
DW: Six years old when I first went to the dancing school. And I do want you to understand, and I'm sure you will. I am talking to you with a fair face, light face. I have learned this...because I am dark, many dark people don't realize that I come from a light-skinned family. So therefore, it is surprising... Just like my light family learned through me how some light people feel about dark people, I learned how some dark people feel about light people. And I sometimes have been very... I was talking to a brown-skinned woman yesterday. Do you know Myrtle Howard? Myrtle Howard for two years I thought she was perfectly white. She has blue eyes white skin, and golden hair, which God gave her. She had nothing to do with it. And I was talking to this friend of mine yesterday, and she just couldn't stand that. I said—I always tell, I learned my mother's technique—and I said to her, "I will tell you what my mother very often used to say, 'Don't forget, Myrtle is blond, blue eyed, and fair.' And as my mother would say, 'People do not love you because you're blond, because you're fair,'" and one thing and another. Because I do think we bring our prejudices.
I have a friend who...well, I've known her intimately for thirty years, and she has blue eyes, red hair, and a white face. And some friend of mine said to me... I said, "I've known her for thirty years! She's not at all prejudiced. She looks white." And she was a Chicago librarian, and I used to say to her all the time, "Naomi, you're going to lose your job." She sat there with a white face, and white people thought that she was white. 'Cause my mother was like that. She was always maneuvering white people into a position to ask her what she was, and she would say, "I'm a nigger." And they didn't know what to say. I could hear her talking. And I said to her, "I'm a nigger." You should have seen that woman's face.' She did not know what to say. Because she knew if she said, "Are you a nigger? You are?" I would say, "What? Are you calling me a nigger?" and so forth and so on. But there are some people who are like that, you see.
I should tell you this story, because I know this woman so well, and I mean, she loves everything black. I have a niece like that, that I have to scold. Because if you're black, if you're black in color, then she thinks that you're wonderful. And I have to say to her, "Black doesn't make you marvelous and wonderful." She didn't realize... I said, "Look at you. You're very fair. Now how do you think I would..." "Oh," she said, "I don't trust light people." She's been brainwashed during the revolution. I made it very dramatic, I said, "Sisty, I have made my friends, and I'm﻿41
DW: (cont.) too old to make new friends." And I said, "If somebody said to me, 'I don't like your niece, she's too light, she's fair and I don't trust light people,' I would have to lose that friend." And I said to her, which is true, I said, "Don't forget, in this family"—that was my mother's saying—"we go from black to white, and in this family there is no prejudice." I'm used to a mixed, a family that goes from black to white, and I like it. Because there is no way for you to be prejudiced. A blond child and I slept together; we were bedmates. So that therefore, he looked with love at a dark...to him, a dark-skinned person represents love and so forth. He was the youngest, and I was the one who said to Helen, "Let him come." What am I talking about?
When I do this little lecture, and then I'm worn out, and I say, "Let them ask me questions." And then, so you ask me questions, yes.
GG: Well, you see, I'm trying to follow the thread of your argument.
DW: Yes, because I do this, I do this, you know. You know that.
GG: Well, that's all right.
DW: You're beautiful. Yes, all right.
GG: All right, now, you're ten, you're in Latin School...
DW: GLS, Girls' Latin School. Which is so different from the way it
is now. Because then, I used to... I've lost my accent, I'm sure. Oh, I came out of the Latin School saying, "Commahnd," "demahnd," British inflection and so forth and so on. Well, you lose that part of it. They couldn't get me to say "rice" for"rise." That's the one word, it seemed perfectly foolish to me. I would not say...in the Latin School you said "rice" for "rise."
GG: Well, give me a sentence where you would use that.
DW: "Rise" means to rise up. Now, wait a minute. Yes. When I stand up, I rise. But everybody... the English people say "rice." And I couldn't. I couldn't say "rice."
GG: In other words, the influence was very English.
DW: Yes. My spelling, all my spelling, was English. Oh, this was a
hundred years ago. But colored, C-O-L-O-U-R, theater, T-H-E-A-T-R-E. I mean, all of the spelling, all of my pronunciations were... Because I learned then, I think the English...you must understand... You don't know that, that's the beauty of children, because they learn so easily. You don't know that...
GG: That it's the English. You just think it's one way to do it.
DW: That's right. That's right, you see.﻿42
GG: But "rice" was too much for you.
DW: Yes, I'll never forget that. Because I couldn't...I don't remember whether anybody else said it or not, but that I couldn't take. That I couldn't take, you see.
GG: You talked before about your being a born actress. Did you get a chance to act in school at all?
DW: Oh, no, no, no. I said, "Oh, heavens. I can't sew, I can't cook." Because you enter Latin School in the seventh grade, and in the grade school, the other school, you learn to cook and sew in those grades. So that therefore, I... What did you ask me?
GG: Whether you had any chance to act in...
DW: No, no, no. Because I will tell you this, I wanted to be fair. I told you about the Latin School, and that I went to school with WASPs and all that, didn't I? I always say that 1 understand the WASPs pretty well, and so forth. But I mean, make no mistake about this, the children in the public schools, the first-generation Irish and poor Irish, and so forth and so on, they called me nigger. And then to the Latin School, and I never heard the word. But there was a subtle prejudice there, you see. Well, no, no, I'll have to back up a little bit. Perhaps you know that because you live in New England. I went to school with middle-class white children at the Latin School. And when I say middle-class, not in the sense that middle... Middle class nowadays is used, I think, according to your salary. I mean, here is a plumber who's earning $14,000, he's called middle class. I went to school with kids who had old New England names, but they were not necessarily blue bloods. Their fathers were doctors and lawyers and bank presidents, or vice-presidents, or one thing or another. And this was many years ago.
My goodness, I told you this was a story. Many of the kids had servants, and they had chauffeurs, and one thing or another. But the Latin School was supposed to be democratic. And so that therefore, they had beautiful backgrounds. White people, WASPs of that type were supposed to have abolitionist blood in them. You follow me? All right. So that therefore, they had to accept black people. But they were the kind of—now maybe I am being unfair—but I'm not! They were the kind of young people who were very nice to you in school. But if they saw you on the street, they got very busy looking in the window. Do you follow me? So I mean, please do not think that they were marvelous people, and that. No. But I mean, the point is, I did not have to go through the humiliation of seeing the heads turn, of hearing an Irish kid up here... I shouldn't say Irish, although there were ones calling me "nigger," and then everybody looked. Do you see what I mean? So that that was the only thing.
When we went to school as little children, the kids called us nigger and one thing and another. My mother said, "You're going to school to learn. What do you care? You come home and play with each other." And we were a very self-contained family. We loved each other. Now, you talk about theater. I mean, there was a circus﻿43
DW: (cont.) in my house all the time. So that therefore, you enjoyed yourself. Because we have a way of saying, "We Bensons only like Bensons." That's not true. But I mean, we have a way of saying that. Because we try, God knows we try. And I like us for trying. I'm not a funny person. But some of the young people in my family think I'm very funny. Because this is what you learn to do. We feel—now, o<f course, everything is changing—that life is not hard for black children. And so that therefore, my mother, I know whenever she called the children...I guess I have my mother's technique. We all have it. We try to make the children laugh. And because I was rather serious, and my mother used to tell me, "You had better learn to laugh, because there is much that you will cry about when you grow older," you see.
GG: She was quite a philosopher.
DW: Oh, yes. I told you. Yes, she was. Yes, because there were so many things that she... I told you about money and my mother. Because I think that was one of the best things she ever taught me, that money is nothing but pieces of paper—I told you that. Unless you spend it, see? There were many things that she said that I say now, to the children, you see? The thing I like about her, she was never small. If she had to lie, she was a big liar; she had a warm, big, generous heart, and so forth and so on. [laughter] That amuses youI
GG: I like to think about it, nothing small about her, even her lies.'
DW: Yes, that's very true! You see, she was a pretty woman. And I
say this 'cause I'm interested. I don't know. I will never know. When people saw my mother, many of them... Well, I remember, maybe I told you this, I used to say to myself, "Oh, I forgot again to tell them that my mother was beautiful." Did I tell you the first time I discovered my mother's beauty?
GG: No.
DW: Oh, all right. I was a little girl. Well, first of all, this has to do with me, too. You remember I was the only dark-skinned person in my group, not my family. All right. You know how casual children are. So now I am maybe seven years old, and I'm going out into the world. So I say to my mother—we're just alone, and maybe it's nighttime—and I say, "I don't like Mary's mother." Well, instantly, my mother stiffens. "Why?" 'Cause she thinks Mary's... All right. "What did she say to you?" "Nothing." And then she gets mad with me. 'Cause I can see the whole setting. And I would say to her, "I don't like her face. It doesn't look like your face." My mother would get very pink, she would bite her lip. This is something else that she taught me. And she would sort of lower her eyes, and she would say, "Well, it would be a funny world if everybody looked like me. I would hate to live in a world where everybody looked alike." And I will remember that always. All right. So that was that. But I did not know...I'm a child. I did not know that she was pretty. You don't know that. Sometimes﻿44
DW: (cont.) when I read books and... All right. I'm very interested in this. I don't know how you feel. I will read books, and I was seven years old, and I looked at my beautiful mother. I'd say to myself, "I don't believe you." All right.
Because the first time I discovered my mother was beautiful, I was fourteen, a big girl. You know the Shearer cottages, of course. And there was a girl... And here's another thing, this girl had a very pretty mother. I mean, she looked exactly like my... Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying that, you know. But she had a beautiful mother, very sophisticated woman from New York, and so forth and so on. My point is, the girl didn't know that about her mother. This was Mother. So that therefore, this girl, she was about—I was fourteen and I figure she was seventeen. So she was a little more sophis... Well, wait a minute. I had met her, and one day she came to my house. She said, "I met the most beautiful girl yesterday." Now you remember, Eugenia is very pretty, I told you Eugenia is very pretty, and once in a while I have a small bit of jealousy about Eugenia. "And she said she lived over here." Well, we... There were not many houses. And so I said to her, "You must mean my cousin Eugenia." Eugenia is an odd name. And she knew it wasn't Eugenia. "No," she said. And I said, "I don't know."
We were sitting in my yard, and she's telling me, "Oh, she was so beautiful." And I said, "Oh, I want to see her, I want to see her." And I said, "I guess what happened was, she must have come, you know, as a visitor." I hadn't seen her yet. Suddenly the girl said, "There she is." And I looked, and I didn't see anybody but my mother. I said, "Where?" She said, "There." I looked, I didn't see anybody but my mother. I said, "I don't see her. Where?" She said, "There." I said, "That's my mother!" And she said, "That's not your mother." I think very quickly, "She has a mother who looks like white. So she's not..." My mother's color has nothing to do with it. "She's not, she doesn't have a dark girl like you." And then I said to myself, "Now why doesn't she think ..." My mother went through this routine, biting her lip, blushing. And I said, "What is my mother doing that for?" And then I said, "Because she knows what we are saying." And I said, "How could she know what we are saying?" And then I said, "My God, she knows that she is beautiful." And I looked at my mother—I'll never forget—and my mother now is looking at me. And I said, "My mother is the most beautiful woman I ever saw." Instead of saying, "Isn't that wonderful?" I got frightened. I remember saying, "Maybe she's so beautiful she doesn't want to be my mother—a mother." My mother read that. She said, " What are you looking at me for?" My mother was beautiful. Well, I think she had been waiting for the moment when I discovered that she was. She said, "What are you looking at me for? You see me all the time. Do you know who this is? This is the mother who cleans and cooks," and one thing and another. "And it seems to me that you two young girls"—she was making us children, and blah, blah, blah. And I forgot again until﻿45
DW: (cont.) I was twenty-one years old, that she was beautiful.
But the interesting thing is, when that girl found out my mother was beautiful, she completely lost interest in her. I mean, she was nothing. She was a mother. It is so interesting that a mother meant nothing.
I told you about my mother cutting bangs? And I said, "You don't look like a mother at all. You look like a beautiful doll.'" I never will... She says, "Dorothy, I'll let my hair grow." But I mean, I don't know why we think of a mother...and I don't even know what a mother looks like. But I mean, I never will forget the indignation that I think, "You don't look like a mother at all," because she'd cut those bangs. But at any rate, the reason that interests me, 'cause I read books. And as I say, the writer always talks about how beautiful his mother was, and I thought my mother was so... I didn't know my mother was beautiful, and when I found out that she was beautiful, I was scared to death. And she could see the fear. And I didn't realize, but I know that she had been waiting. "One day she's gonna discover that I'm beautiful." Because I told you about the kids in my family when discovered that I was a writer?
GG:	No.
DW:	Oh. That was very charming.
GG:	Oh, was this in the car? The incident in the car?"
DW:	That's right.
GG:	Yes, you told me that.
DW:	But my point in telling you that is, my mother... I don't think I would have known how to react, if it hadn't been for my mother.
GG: No, what you're saying is that certain ideas distance people from each other, and that if you were a writer, you'd be very far away from the children.
DW: My mother was supposed to be a mother! She wasn't supposed to be beautiful. I know that may not make any sense, you see.
GG: Yes, well, I was trying to see the parallels. For the kids to see that you were, to know that you were a writer, would suddenly have meant that they would lose you...
DW: Oh, that's right.
GG: Too far away.
DW: They would lose me. Yes, sure. And then I said something about food. "All I do..." She said the same thing. And then I said,﻿46
DW: (cont.) "We've got to stop in town because, you know, the kids," and so on and so on. "All I do," I said, "is stand at the stove and cook for these kids." And I could see...
GG: Well, what were the influences that moved you into becoming a
writer so young? Is that something you've done any thinking about? Because I was wondering about that. You were writing poetry very young...
DW: Well, no, I never wrote poetry. Don't confuse me with Helen.
GG: Oh, you wrote a story...
DW: Yes, when I was seven years... The reason I will remember this, I remember very well, is because I was seven years old and wrote my first story. My father was so proud that I could write that he put it in his pocket and lost it—took it downtown. Do you think those men cared? Don't forget, my father—as a child, my father, you know, was now fifty-five, has got a little girl. I mean, my father was an old bachelor. Not only that, but he had a whole family. Well, I've told you that, I've told you that. He had the whole family, extended family. Because I told you the beautiful thing that my mother said about how rich I was, didn't I? Haven't I told you that?
GG: Tell me again.
DW: All right. Oh, oh, this backs up. I'm kind of glad you asked me, because I told you that I was the only dark child, and... All right. So that therefore, I was in dancing school, let me say, and the mothers . • . and so forth and so on. And they would say, "Who is that little girl?" They meant, and which is interesting, they meant, "What is that little dark girl doing here?" or something. Not unkindly, not unkindly. Because very often—Melvin was very blond—and they just wanted to know, not unkindly, whether he was white or black. Didn't make any difference, because somebody... I'll put it this way...
GG: What were the mothers doing? Were they observing the lessons?
DW: No, they brought their children. Don't forget, these are little children.
GG: Oh, I see. Oh, yes. But everybody took dancing lessons, or some kind of lessons at that period, piano lessons...
DW: Oh, yes, we took piano lessons, and so forth. But no, this was a dance... Now, I'm just being funny, and I'm just talking to you, okay? Don't forget that...I don't say just Boston. I don't fault the Bostonians as much as many outside people do, because it's a very natural thing for you to... My mother, and Barbara Townsend, who you don't know, they read the society pages, and they talked about... You don't know—a Bostonian—there was a woman named﻿47
DW: (cont.) Eleanora Sears. The old Sears family. Old, old family. I am a little girl...evidently I am a preschooler, 'cause as long as she walked...I mean, she walked maybe a couple of miles a day. And as long as I live, I will remember my mother saying to me, "Come here, Dorothy." And she would say to me, "That is Miss Eleanora Sears." She loved to walk, and so forth and so on. She was showing me a blueblood. She did not say, "This is a blueblood." But they followed the...well, what am I talking about? I know why they followed them. Because there was no television. They followed the newspapers the way we avidly listen to things about the movie actors and one thing and another. But the only thing they had in those days were the society people. That was the day of radio, you know. There was no television in those days, you see. So that my point is, they had the debutantes... Did I tell you how we used to pronounce debutantes? We used to say deb-yoo-tantee. [laughter]
But let me tell you, this is so interesting. I wrote the book, The Living Is Easy, and I made gentle—not cruel—I made gentle fun of that dancing class, little dancing school that had forty children. And this was so interesting to me. 'Cause it bothered me. "What in the heck," I said to myself, "do you care?" You'd be surprised at the people who said that they went to that dancing school who had never been there. Isn't that interesting? And 1 made gentle fun of the dancing school.
GG: They refused to recognize that they had been part of it.
DW: No! People who were not part of it said that they went to that dancing school. Do you follow what I'm saying?
GG: Oh, I see.
DW: Now, I wrote about it as a little snobbish, as a little snob dancing school. But many people who did not go to that dancing school ... Because that's what happened. That dancing school ended because... Oh, you asked me if I took music lessons. Yes, but not from this particular woman. This woman, I don't know—this is off the record, it doesn't make any difference. This woman had music pupils, and then she had a lovely house, and I don't know where she got the idea, but somebody must have suggested to her, why don't you have a dancing school? And so we did have a dancing ...so she had a dancing school. There were two classes, two grades of children. I mean, the little children, who began at six, and the others who were fourteen or something of that sort, it doesn't make any difference. But my point is, so there was a dancing school for the forty select children. And then...
GG: All right. Forty select. On what basis were they selected?
DW: Can I tell you a little aside about my father? My father was a businessman in Dun and Bradstreet, you know that. And they had﻿48
DW: (cont.) many fights, because my father could not understand... And I fault him for this—well, maybe not fault him—he thought everybody should be a businessman in Dun and Bradstreet. And when my mother talked about the people, the lovely people who were courthouse attendants, and so forth and so on, he was not interested. I am not on my father's side in this. Because the point is, I have a friend, Babe Goldberg. Do you know Babe? All right, you don't know Babe. It doesn't make any difference. Because Babe is an old Worcesterite, and I once said to her, "Babe, I come from the class of the genteel poor." And she liked that word. I remember things that 1 say when you call them to my attention. And so that therefore, these people that my mother knew—and I told you that she brought many people in, she saved many rents and so forth and so on—well, these were the genteel poor. But my father, I don't think he was so much interested in their gentility as he was in the reason why were they poor. "Here I am, I was born a
slave___" Now I don't know my father's thinking, but I am sure
that he couldn't understand why they were not rich. 'Cause I remember, my mother used to say, "Not everybody wants to be a businessman. There are some people who wantto be..." this and that and the other, you see. Now wait a minute, I'm answering one question that you asked me about who were they.
GG: The forty.
DW: The forty. All right. They were mixed. There was a black judge, there were black lawyers, there were businessmen, one of whom sold his store to Filene's, I told you that. There were businessmen, my father was a businessman. But there were also, now I don't want to be wrong on this, there were also people who were butlers. But because they were butlers for the rich, they knew what the rich did, how the rich ate and so forth and so on, and they could bring up their children. They knew that you should wear certain things, they knew that you should eat certain things, and so forth and so on. I'm sure you know, my people were house slaves on both my mother and father's side. But you know that there is that split, don't you, between house servants and the field... So that the genteel poor... You see, the difference is... 'Cause when the black revolution started, I was very impatient. I said to them, "Where were your grandparents when my father came out of slavery?" and so forth and so on. So my point is, this man who was a butler was sending his kid to Harvard. Do you follow me? So it wasn't that he was raising his son...he knew that in the house where he lived, there was a doctor, there was a lawyer, and one thing and another, you see. Because in my day, I thought the only college was Harvard, and that so many of the black people*•.well, that was their ambition. I mean, my father was a businessman; there were many businessmen. And that is why I am a writer.
GG: Why do you say that is why you were a writer?
DW: Because my father was not a poor man. I told you what my father said to about writing? I'll never forget. "Your little head is﻿49
DW: (cont.) for making books, writing books, mine is for buying and
selling bananas." He was called the "black banana king" of the Boston market. My point is, he, thank God, made enough money. 'Cause I always think that when I see my own family...I told you this. He made enough money so that he didn't have to worry. He thought he was going to leave me a million dollars when he died. Remember that. All right. So that I thank my mother and my father. So they "allowed" me to write. Because even though I was going to be a starving writer, because writers starve and all that stuff, what difference did it make? Because after all, my father was a rich man and he was going to leave me all this money. And I think they —my mother had the foresight to see, just as I'm sitting here talking to you, if you write books, maybe even if you don't sell them, but there they are, on bookshelves, and so forth and so on.
GG: The heritage, the notion...
DW: I told you this beautiful story about my father giving me the money to bless? I told you that.
GG: No, no. You haven't shared this yet, I don't think.
DW: Oh, 'cause this is my father... I never even told my mother to
the day that she died, because my mother told me that money...she didn't want me to like money. I mean, you understand... Well, this was before we came down here. But the season had started, and so evidently my father was making money. My room was on the top floor, the bedroom. And I don't know, I was a little girl, so I guess I was maybe only about nine. It was dark, though. And my father would come up to my room, and I believed my mother, that money was dirty. And here I am, and she...oh God, the woman was a masterful housekeeper. So my bed was so clean, and so forth and so on. And my father, he called me Dimmy. The reason he called me Dimmy is because he could never pronounce "Dorothy." And I told you, he said to my mother when I was born, "little Mary," his mother's name. And she said, "Little what?" And she...that woman. But he said, "I understand your mother." You see, Helen had been named for her mother—no, for my mother's mother. So you couldn't have two Helens, you know what I mean. And if she couldn't name me for her mother, she doggone wasn't going to name me for his mother, you see. But at any rate, so he would come up, and he would... I don't know how much money, he would have lots of money in packets. He called me his lucky penny.
Oh, I'll explain why he called me... My name, when I was a child, I had a lot of dimples all over, and they called me Dorothy Dimples. Then, when I was about seven years old, and I used to... people asked me my name. And I liked my mother for that, I mean, she never thought things were cute. I got to be a certain age, and she was explaining to me, "Your name..." I didn't know what dimples were, I thought it was a name. Then she explained to me that dimples was just a nickname that your family called, so when﻿50
DW: (cont.) people asked you what your name was, "Don't say that you're Dorothy Dimples, just say that you're Dorothy West."
At any rate, when my father would come up and say, "Dimmy, I want you to..." I can see my white sheet and the money. Because for a little bit...the dirty money was on my bed. And I loved my father, adored him; my mother was a little jealous. He would say, "I want you to bless the money." So I put my hand on the money, and he would say, "I made a lot of money today, and if you bless the money, it will double tomorrow." I would put my hand on the money, and then he would take it up and go away. But I will remember that forever. Not just that one occasion, but very often he used to do that. I knew it was a secret that I must not tell my mother, and I never told my mother. But yes, yes, I blessed my father's money all the time. [laughter]
GG: Well, go back to the story you told about when he was a young boy, I think right after he was freed...
DW: At seven.
GG: At seven. He suggested to his mother that they open a restaurant...
DW: No, no. A time lapse of three years.
GG: Just to get a sense of where he got this notion about the importance of money.
DW: Well, my mother used to tease me. I don't know. Ah, that's interesting. Because I do not like money, it's funny. It may be because of my father. My mother used to tease me—I know now that she was teasing me—and she would say, "Your father likes money." I would get furious with her, and I would say to her, "My father..." I would be furious, "My father doesn't like money! He can't help it if he makes money. He likes to sell fruit." And I was passionate about that. Because I don't know why I felt that it was wrong to like money. Well, I guess she had taught me that.
GG: Yes, she had a different opinion.
DW: And I know now that she was teasing me, to get this response from me, to get my reaction. I would say, "He can't help it; my father can't help making money." Well, he was a dandy. Oh, I meant to tell you this story, 'cause my father had a racehorse. Now, looking at me, you will not know, you cannot know that the dream of my life has been to have a racehorse. Because my father bought a retired racehorse when he was a young man... Before he was married to my mother he was a dandy, and he won a cake for doing the cakewalk. He always had sore feet, because when he was a young man, dressed up as a dandy in too tight shoes, his shoes were too tight, and he always limped a little bit. He used to tell us...the blue eyes! He used to tell us about Ned, and those blue eyes would be gleaming. He used to tell his children... And I think it was then that I fell in love. I had to have a race-﻿51
DW: (cont.) horse. I will never have a racehorse, but to this day, I love horses. I can look at...and the tears will come to my eyes, because I think they're so beautiful. And I don't know whether the tears will come to my eyes because I'm seeing and hearing my...I don't know...or whether it is the racehorse. I don't know whether it is my father...
GG: You're hearing your father.
DW: Maybe so. Because when I see pansies, I do not, the tears do not
come to my eyes. But my father used to bring home the first pan... you know, we came out here. But pansies are early, and so I could reach over...
GG: Oh. When did you start coming down to Martha's Vineyard?
DW: When I was a little one, so I have no recollection of it.
GG: Well, you used to come during the summer, between school periods, right?
DW: Yes. I have two pieces that you might be interested in that I
wrote for the Gazette—about my mother. A long piece I wrote for one of the invitation issues. I told you I was going to do a piece...all right. One was about my Christmas, and comparing it with my poor dear mother's Christmas.
GG: Oh, I would love to see both those pieces.
DW: All right. 'Cause I told you about my poor mother's broken-down ... You see, they were poor, there were nineteen children.
GG: So your mother came from a large family.
DW: Yes.
GG: Okay. And they were poor.
DW: Well. They had to be poor. Because I've told you this story that touches me now, about my mother when she fed us children? Well, we had a lovely house. It was a lovely house.
GG: Where was your house?
DW: On Brookline Avenue. And there was a butler's pantry.
GG: Was this a brownstone?
DW: No. It was a brick house. I didn't know that, but to me a house is a brick house, a red brick house. But it has nothing to do with the red brick. Those were the most secure years of my life. I did not know then, because I thought...my eyes can fill with﻿52
DW: (cont.) tears when I know that children are hungry, because we
had such security. My father came home on the dot, and he always brought something for us. "What did you bring us?" And he always had a piece of candy or something, you see. And my mother was always in the kitchen. Well, my point is, I know that they were giving us security, and I think one of the reasons my mother was in the kitchen is so that if we had been chased home that, you know, she would be there, you see. What was I telling you about?
GG: Well, you were talking about your mother's childhood.
DW: Oh, yes. The reason I don't know...and so that therefore we ate a la carte, and that interests me. We didn't know any better, naturally. My mother asked us what we wanted to eat, and I know now...
GG: Really?
DW: Oh, yes. But you see, don't forget, I'm telling you these things because that went back to her childhood, I'm sure. She never expected to get married, you know. My mother had had some singing lessons and one thing and another. But the point is, I suppose, at some time or other she probably said to herself, "If I ever have kids, they're not gonna have to eat any old thing..." So that therefore, "What do you want?" to one child. "What do you want?" to the other. "What do you want?" And so forth and so on. One mother would be in the kitchen passing the various choices of food out through the butler's pantry, and the other mother...the other mother was in the dining room, to teach you manners. "Wipe your mouth before you drink water." "Don't talk with your mouth full," and so forth and so on. The reason that's very interesting is because if you tell a child early, it's an automatic... it doesn't mean anything to them. You see what I mean? To turn to the story that I thought I'd told you, once we were eating, and I remember my mother...because her voice, I was accustomed to her voice—it choked. And she said to my aunt, I mean, now that my aunt had come out of the kitchen, my aunt who was so fair, and, well, I told you about that. At any rate, she had come out of the kitchen, and they were looking at us or something, and I remember I heard my mother say to my aunt, "Minnie, the one thing I pray God is that these children will have all they want to eat as long as they live." And it's so interesting to me, because I know food keeps you alive, and I suppose... 'Cause my grandmother had nineteen children, but she didn't raise them all.
GG: Your mother's mother?
DW: My mother's mother. And it's interesting, because my mother had warm coloring, lovely coloring, as I told you, and in my family— I think this is all over now—when a baby is born very white, we call each other up and we pray for the baby. Well, if I may tell you this little aside, I had a very white-skinned aunt, and she﻿53
DW: (cont.) was my mother's younger sister. My mother was always
yelling and screaming—she was a yeller and screamer—at my aunt, "If I put you in the oven and kept you there all day, you wouldn't turn brown." Sometimes I would say to my mother, "Rachel, don't say that to Minnie." My mother, now I know she was saying, "You don't know what you're talking about, child. Keep still." She would say to me, "Oh, Minnie doesn't care what I'm talking about." This is what she was talking, and Minnie did know. All right.
Now it has come my aunt's time to die. She is younger, and it has never occurred to my mother, and one day my mother came out of my Aunt Minnie's sickroom, and I never will forget this as long as I live. I looked at her face, my mother's face, and I said, "This is the morning that Rachel knows that Minnie is going to die." And she was talking, but not to me. "Speech was given man to hide his thoughts." Believe me, it was in her case. And she said to me, to the past, to her mother, she said, "Mama always lost her white babies. Mama never could raise her white babies. Mama's white babies always died." And so, I think what happened was, the reason they didn't care for white people, were frightened of white skin was because they thought that the baby was pale and sick. And I think that's probably true. Now, I call it a coincidence, I don't know. I wasn't born then. But my grandmother apparently lost many of her fair children. I guess my Aunt Minnie was the only one who lived.
This very aunt, who was so white, I never will forget this as long as I live. Because her hand has never looked so white, and my hand has never looked so dark. I knew what she was saying. She was saying, "Give me some of your darkness," you see.
GG: Because that meant stability and long life.
DW: That strength. Because I couldn't understand, because I used to
get mad with my mother. She would say, "You're not supposed to be sick." One day she said that to me. She didn't mention color, but I knew that she meant color, because I guess to them, here was she with her warm, rich, dark skin. I don't know why. It just happened to be that way in my family, and I suppose it's because Mama lost her white babies. So if you lose your white babies, then your dark babies must be your strongest. I don't know that, but I imagine that that's what they thought. 'Cause I used to get mad with her. And she used to worry about the light-skinned children. I didn't know why, but she thought that if you're fair... She took more care of the white-skinned children. I wasn't jealous or anything like that, don't misunderstand me. But she thought that...
GG: That they were ailing, or they were washed out, and you were strong.
DW: That's right, yes.
GG: Now, with this kind of careful training, where did you go to college?﻿54
DW: Well, that's my whole point, when I told you that...
GG: "Harvard was the only school," you said. But there weren't...
DW: No, no, no. But don't forget that by that time...there were some things. There were some sort of traumatic things that I don't like to talk about...
GG: Well, don't. I don't want...
DW: Well, no, no, no. The whole point, it's hard to explain. When I say it's hard to explain, I think it's because I don't want to be bitter about it. I don't want to be bitter about it. But that got all messed up. You see, the whole point is, I don't particularly want this on the record...
DW: There was a fire station on the corner. And a great field where they grazed. Here's the fire station, and maybe our house was at the end of the street where I turned to come in, and we used to go through the fence and pick flowers to take home to Rachel, to take home to my mother. I seem to remember that; I think we are going to grade school now. We're not big enough to go to the Latin School.
GG: But you live right near what is now the Deaconess Hospital.
DW: Oh, yes, because here is Brookline Avenue where I lived, and you walk about five minutes, then you come down Longwood Avenue. We were right there.
GG: And what was the name of those other hospitals that were right there? Children's?
DW: Children's Hospital...I can't help it, I'll never like the Children's Hospital because we had a baby who died there. But that was not the hospital's fault. Well, I became a mother when I was ten years old. I mean...because it was interesting. I've always ...I am a very maternal person, and this baby, family baby, came into the home, and we loved each other very much. Because the family couldn't understand it. 'Cause I was her mother. And there was some telepathy or something, because I was coming home from school, and she would get up and go to the window, and there I was. They couldn't understand it. But at any rate, this baby died. This is the way I tell the story, when I tell it to myself. I was very bright when I was ten years old—you'll see why I say that—and I was writing stories. I had started writing when I was seven. You can explain this if you want to, to yourself. I don't know. So that I loved this child very much. Do you want to hear this story?
GG: Yes, if you want to tell it.﻿55
DW: All right. She had to go to the hospital. I mean, she got sick. Maybe we are wrong—we don't let our children be babies too long. She used to suck her finger, and we taught her not to. She was only eighteen months old. She was very ill, and I can hear them saying in their warm voices, "Yes, darling, you can suck your finger." But at any rate, she went to the hospital, and she died. Well, I was in bed, and something waked me. Either...I will never know whether it was the ringing of the telephone or the ringing of the doorbell, because in those days the policeman used to come and notify you.
GG: Oh, I see, if someone had died.
DW: If someone had died. This is long ago. I don't know whether they did that because not everybody had a telephone. We had a telephone. I don't know, it's not terribly important. I don't know whether it was the doorbell ringing that waked me, but I went right back to sleep, but evidently not into a deep sleep, naturally. I'll remember this as long as I live. I wake up because I hear voices. And my mother, and my white... Because I remember my aunt's white face, and my mother's golden face, and they're looking in the mirror. The reason they are looking in the mirror is because they are trying to be as far away from me as they can. I'm in the bed here, and the mirror... So I see their faces, and I hear my mother—I've said this before, I'll remember it till I die —she said, "I don't know what to do about Dorothy. If I wake her up and tell her now, she'll never forget it. If I don't wake her up, she'll never forgive me." Because she was looking in the mirror, she saw that my eyes were open, so she came to the bed and she said to me... Either she said the hospital had just called, or someone... "And Sister died. And she won't have to suffer any more. Now go back to sleep." And I went back to sleep; I turned over and went back to sleep, 'cause I was an obedient child. In the morning, I awoke, and I said, "Something happened. Something happened." And then I said, "I know, Sister died." And I jumped up and I ran into Eugenia's room. She was the beauty, who spent all her life being beautiful. I will never forget this, I said to her. "Eugenia, did you know? Sister died last night." And the reason I say this, two tears squeezed out of Eugenia's eyes. It was the only time I ever saw her cry about anything. All right.
I know it's interesting about mothers and children. I know my mother thought I was a most unnatural child, because I was very grown up. I mean, Sister was dead and so forth and so on. "You want to go to school?" "Yes, I want to go to school." And I went to school and I told everybody my little sister died, or something like that, and they must have told the teacher. The teacher called me to the desk and said, "You can go home if you want to." I said, "No, I don't want to go home." I'm a bright kid. So then comes the day of the funeral, and my mother says, "You don't have to go." "I want to go to the funeral." We go to the funeral. For forty years I couldn't stand carnations because I smelled the carnations.﻿56
DW: (cont.) That's all right. It didn't mean anything to me, but there was the smell of carnations. And my mother said, "Go and look at Sister." I went over there, and I looked, and I came back and I said, "There's a little dead girl in the coffin. Where's Sister?" I went to the funeral... The reason I was so excited, I thought I was going to get her and bring her home. Why did I think I was going to get her and bring her home?
GG: Well, you didn't understand what "funeral" meant.
DW: I had seen people die. I knew that other people died and were put in the ground. Why didn't I know that?
GG: You know, you mentioned some names before I'd like to go back to. Like, I remember you mentioned Monroe Trotter as a family friend.
DW: I told you, that's why to this day I cannot like—what's his name? —Washington, Booker T. Washington.
GG: Booker T. Washington.
DW: You didn't know they were mortal enemies?
GG: Yes, I did.
DW: And so I was brought up on...
GG: In other words, the family's relationship to Monroe Trotter was a very close one?
DW: Well, yes. Bessie Trotter was my mother's best friend, I would say. Maud Trotter was my godmother. And so I mean, we were all involved, we were always involved. And I don't know, I guess a little money passed...I don't know. Because when I had these teachers, I... That's why I liked my mother. They were teachers. I suppose that was a euphemism, I don't know. But remember, I'm saying this with the greatest admiration for my mother, because my mother wanted... Well, because they got paid. Now I mean, this is sort of between us. They got paid, and it was very helpful to them, you see. And so they came...I think, maybe I was two years old when Bessie Trotter taught me, and I have little things—I'm not two, I'm about four years old. But the little stars, and whoever was teaching me, well, I think it was Grace Turner, was teaching me then, and she put little stars on the paper, and so forth and so on. Because I've told you that I used to say to my mother, "Why didn't you take care of us? You had other people take care of us," or some sort of foolishness. And in the end I did sort of thank her for our upbringing, because we're nice, we're nice. We're polite, and so forth and so on, and I can't stand bad manners. They did teach us a great deal, between the Latin School and the home environment. I do think we turned out rather well, I really do. And I sort of regret now saying to you that my mother was at fault, and one thing or another. Because, when the black revolution started, and I criticized these people, and I said to them, "Where were you when my father..."﻿57
GG: What was your basic criticism of the young people who were involved in the black revolution, would you say?
DW: Two things. They talked a lot about color. I mean, you know, who do you think you are just because you've got straight hair, and just because you have... What has that got to do with the price of eggs? Then also, if you will recall, they hated doctors, and all professional-type black people were called Uncle Toms. And that is, as I said, the background of my novel. It had nothing to do with the black revolution. Because I was showing, actually using the people that I do know, I was trying to show that all of these people, they do not spring full-blown as doctors. Well, I don't know how much you know about this island, but it's very interesting. You would be surprised at the number of doctors who helped to work their way through school by—there were not ferries then, doesn't make any difference—who worked on the steamers.
GG: Yes, Ewart was one of the people who worked his way through school on the steamers, on the Bangor-Maine line.
DW: All right. And then the...
GG: Well, what was the family's defense for, or attitude toward Monroe...
DW: My particular family?
GG: Your family. When Monroe Trotter was... He had a very rough time in Boston. Do you remember that?
DW: Of course. Well, I don't know. I don't know how well I remember
that, because I guess I was still quite young when he died. I mean, a little child. How long has he been dead? You will have to tell me, and then I'll know how old I was.
GG: I don't remember when he died, but it would seem to be a good couple of decades ago.
DW: Well, then I wasn't that young. I was thinking that I was maybe eighteen or twenty, but maybe I was older. What was the connection?
GG: You just remember him, you've mentioned him as a family friend.
DW: Well, the thing is, I don't remember him so much. I remember...
GG: Bessie.
DW: Now, he was probably in my house, but don't forget, in those days, we had a big house. Well, anyway, I told you about the first time I saw an apartment, I didn't know what in the world it was.
GG: Yes.﻿58
DW: In those days, you might come down... In the daytime, you were
sent for. But if my mother had a night party or anything, I just wouldn't know anything about that. I mean, I wouldn't see. I would hear, but I just wouldn't...
GG: It was a period when children were just not...
DW: Yes. Oh, and I tell you what you had in my day, 'cause Helen was, Helen balked. You know Helen. All right. We had, you had accomplishments. I played the piano for this guest; Helen was supposed to recite poetry, and she always fell apart and wouldn't recite the poetry, and shamed my mother, and so forth and so on. And Eugenia, what did Eugenia do? Oh, she had a little violin, and she played the violin. But I mean, that's it. I mean, you didn't just come, you came and...
GG: With your accomplishments.
DW: And I think the word really was that, and every child had an accomplishment, and mine was to play piano, you see, and Helen's was to recite poetry, you know. She was horrible, and so forth. But she was the genius, the family genius. She has an IQ of one hundred fifty something, isn't that genius? But she's crazy. And we say, I think it's stupid for a person to have a high IQ and be so crazy. She writes good poetry, though. And she's a fool. She was writing all this poetry, and she thinks that they should know that Helen Johnson is writing such beautiful poetry, and so forth and so on. But I tell Abby, her daughter... Well, Abby is bright. So that therefore, I know that she's got all these glorious poems. I'll give them to you; I'll give them to Harvard. It is a shame, because I imagine that she writes... I resented her. She wanted to send all the stuff to me, and I got mad, I resented it. I'm head of the family, and she says, "No, I don't want to be the head of the family, you be the head of the family." And so that I'm the head of the family.
GG: You have to make all the decisions as to what...
DW: Yes. And she wanted me to, she wanted to give me... Because she probably thought the poetry would be safe, and that I would do something about it, and so forth and so on. So I said no. I didn't mean to get mad about it, but I said no. But in the end, of course, I may tell her to send me the poetry, because it seems stupid to have it get lost. I know that, as I said, Abby would not throw away her mother's poems. I'm sure that she wouldn't. So what am I supposed to be answering now? 'Cause I go that way, you asked me to go that way. [laughter]
GG: Well, I was going to try to tie one thing together, and that was, if someone started to write a biography of Dorothy West...
DW: Yes?
GG: ...is there anyone you know who would be capable of writing such a book at this time?﻿59
DW: At this time? Well, all right. May I?
GG: All right, now.
DW: Why would anybody write a book about me?
GG: All right. Now let me rephrase the question. What would you want them to have in that biography?
DW: I don't know. Because I'm a very private person. I told you about the little diary I kept when I was in... And the writer in me won't let me tear it up, but every once in a while I say I'm going to tear this thing up. But I can't tear it up, because the writer in me won't let me tear it up.
GG: Maybe that's too difficult a question.
DW: What would I want them to write about me?
GG: Yes, what would you think would have to be in that biography for it to be valid?
DW: Well, I'd have to say it this way, because this is the way I've always thought about things. I do write about my family, and of course I'm in it. I don't think I could ever write it about me. But I couldn't help being in it, because of my family. I couldn't care less about who my slave ancestor was in 1770, but I'm fascinated about who my ancestor was...
Oh! This is interesting. This is an aside. Johnny Moseley, and Louise came to see me the other day. But one of the reasons they wanted to come to see me is because they had with them a Scottish, a woman whose mother... Wait a minute—her mother is Scottish, has this charming Scottish accent. You will want to meet her someday. And her father was West Indian or something — doesn't make any difference. But at any rate, I have a little Scottish blood in me. And I was just talking to her, well, because she was Scottish, and one thing and another, and I said to her... Now, oh, God knows, why is this relevant? All right. And I said to her, "And sometimes I hear the bagpipes." Oh, I made them laugh. I always make people laugh; that's my mother's technique. And I said, "My mother used to call her grandfather the meanest man this side of hell." And of course they all laughed, they thought that was very funny. My point was, my mother describes him as the meanest man this side of hell, and yet at the same time, why is it? I said, "Is it because I yearn...do I say to myself that if you knew me you would like me?" And so forth and so on. Because he had married...my great-grandmother had eleven children by this man. And I said, "Sometimes when I hear the bagpipes, and I'm attracted to Scotland ..." Now she's a doctor. I don't know whether she is a psychiatrist, or what, I just took it for granted...I think she is a medical doctor. Because she said very easily...now, she did not say the call of the blood, although that was my mother's phrase. It's﻿60
DW: (cont.) very interesting, 'cause she thought... Oh, it doesn't
matter, I'll tell you in a minute. Because she felt—do you believe this?—she felt that the tenth of a quart of Scottish blood in me— do you believe that?—had some yearning for Scotland.
GG: Could be, could be.
DW: You said that so easily. 'Cause I was so surprised when she said that, 'cause she said that very easily. Because I am very sentimental about the dour Scotch, and that's what I told you. But that ancestor was the meanest man this side of hell. Although I also told you about how he went around to all the white men in town? I told you that, you see. So I don't know.
GG: So in other words, you'd like something about the heritage.
DW: Yes, but back to my point. But I only go back to my American roots. I just, I'd like that, because I have a good friend, Liz White. Liz White, when...twenty years ago, thirty years ago, she was always dragging me to the movies about the 1770s, and I couldn't have cared less. I mean, this has nothing to do with black and white. But I was bored; I mean, "thee" and "thou" and all that. Maybe that's why I'm not mad for Shakespeare, because the people seem unreal to me, and all these costumes, and the wigs. So that, but I am interested...! don't mean that I'm interested just in my roots, but I mean, I am interested in black people a hundred years ago, or a hundred and fifty or so forth. And so, just like the novel I'm writing now, it begins about four generations ago—which is the point of it, that these were slaves—and in the end they are doctors and so forth, but they began as slaves. Of course, I'm older now, but I'm having a little difficulty with the young people. I mean, I'm not terribly interested in them, and I think I'm not terribly interested in them because they have no past yet. Do you see what I mean? You see?
GG: Well, they do have a past, but they haven't...been unaware of it.
DW: All right. So that to write about me... Personally, I like writing about my family, but I cannot—I told you that when I was nineteen years old, I started this novel about Eugenia, Helen, and I? I bet I had no...I bet I was not really in it. Perhaps I can't see myself.
GG: Well, I just was trying to get a feeling for what we should really be trying to put on the record, what aspect of your experience you
felt___ Was it significant to you, or to your family, or to other
people around you? In other words, what things...
DW: Now what period are we talking about now? I'm talking about when I went to New York.
GG: No, I'm just giving you kind of an overall view. What do you feel were some of the significant things that happened to you, or happened because you were present? For instance, when you talk about the attitude of the people at Harborside Restaurant, it's obvious﻿61
GG: (cont.) that your presence makes the difference at Harborside.
DW: Yes, it does, it does.
GG: All right. Now, if you're looking over your life, some of the things that happened...
DW: May I tell you about Harborside?
GG: Let me just finish the point I was making. If you look over your life experience, then your presence must have made a difference in several different arenas.
DW: That I will agree to. I think so.
[break]
DW: My mother used to tell us she was a perfect beauty. She was. We used to jump up and down and go out of our minds. She would say, "Dorothy, pinch your nose." "Eugenia, your lip is..." and so on and so on. And we would say to her, "Well, what about you?" She'd say, "Children, I'm a perfect beauty." And we'd say, "You said..." Literally, we would jump up and down. "You said nobody was perfect." "Except me. I'm the only person that I know that's perfect." And we used to get so mad, and we used to jump up...
GG: What was she doing with that? Why was she saying that?
DW: See, she was criticizing us. Oh, look. This is what my mother... we got to be ladies. She used to take us downstairs—I guess this is ridiculous—to the piano and play the scales. And we would go, "Ha-ha-ha." [laughs] She would teach us how to laugh like ladies. Sometimes she used to get so mad with me, because you pulled your fingers. And I was saying, "Rachel, if you wanted me to do all that, you should have had a beautiful daugher." But you know what she used to say? So beautiful, to me. She would get mad with me, and she would say, "You look just like your father. And I find out no fault with your father. Your father was a very nice-looking man, a very nice-looking man." I can hear her saying that, yes. Because everybody said that my father could have spit me out of his mouth.
Another time that I thought she was odd. She had had an operation. And I went to the hospital, and she was sitting bolt up, face red, and I came to the door and she looked me up and down. I said, "What in the devil is she doing?" She was a character. She was the only black woman in this room, and there were three white women in the room with her. And I knew her very well. And she said, "Dorothy, do you know a white woman named..." Zoom! I said, "Rachel, for God's sake." "For God's sakes, the devil, do you know a white woman named Mary Smith?" I said, "Yes, Rachel. Why?" But I'll tell you what happened, it's interesting. She was a white neighbor﻿62
DW: (cont.) of mine, a lovely woman, many years ago. And we were talking. I said, "My mother is in the hospital here." Now we have a lovely thing here, because I used to go to the hospital and see my mother and I stayed one hour. "Dorothy, go down the hall and see Mrs. Smith. Go visit so-and-so." So that therefore when she went to the hospital to visit a friend, she remembered that Dorothy's mother was in there. And she said to the woman at the desk, "Where is Dorothy West's mother?" And they said, "Room thirteen," or fourteen. She comes, she looks, she don't see no colored lady. She goes back, and she says, "What room did you say?" The woman says, "Room fourteen." She goes back, and still doesn't see a colored lady. And then of course, the people, they're curious. And then she comes back. This is my mother. Well, wait a minute. She says she doesn't want to offend a white person by asking her if they're... So she said, "Is there a Mrs. West in the room?" My mother says yes. But she said, "Are you the mother..." She wants to pinpoint her. Now my mother is scared to death, and she says, "Why?" And the woman says, "Well, Dorothy told me that you were ill." But my mother doesn't believe this. She thinks that it is a social worker trying to break some news to her. And she asks these questions, and the woman says I'm all right. So that therefore when I arrived, she's looking me all over to see what I've broken. And then when she finds out that I'm all right, then... But I mean, isn't that interesting? Because we always think, "What do they care whether you... I mean, what difference?"
We had a little boy, lovely little boy, who, when he went downtown, hung his head—I couldn't figure it out—because white people looked at him, trying to figure out whether he was black or white. Black people saw him—you are not black, but you would see him and you would think he was a lovely colored child. But white people, they didn't want to believe, you see, and they stared at him. I know white people passing who saw him sort of smiled, as if to say, he's beautiful. And so he had smiles from black people, and stares from whites. They would punch each other, and so forth and so on and so on. I'll never forget this, because I took him in the drugstore—I'll never forget this as long as I live, because he wasn't that light. I couldn't understand it, and then I said, "He's afraid. He doesn't want to look at white people, because he knows they're going to look..." So I took him into the... I was with a friend, and I said, "Do you want some ice cream?" and looked at her And she said yes. And so we talked about ice cream, I could see him looking at me. And then I said, "Do you want some?" And he said yes. So we went into the drugstore. We got into the drugstore at the counter, and I said to this friend of mine, "I don't want any ice cream now." And she said, "Neither do I." I could see him looking at me, and I said, "Do you want some?" He said yes Then the man came, and he said, "What do you want?" I said, "I don't care for anything." And he said, "What do you want, little boy?" And he looked at me—"Please tell him--" and I looked away. And he said, "What do you want, little boy?" I'll never forget, he said, "Choc-o-lit. Choc-o-lit ice cream." I'll never forget that.﻿63
DW: (cont.) But the ice was broken. And then after that, he could. I'll never forget that. Because I felt so bitter.
But listen, my dear child, as I'm sure you know, there's none of that any more. Oh, my God, black and white come into the drugstore, and nobody pays any attention to it. I mean, as we say, there are many changes. I know you can appreciate that, I never thought I'd live to see. And I feel so happy that I... I believe we're in a good world.
GG: Now, could we go back a little bit...
DW: Yes.
GG: ...to two things? Sort of tie things together. You said that, a
couple of times you started to talk about your trip to Mosccw, and then said, "Well, maybe they're really not interested in that."
-DW: But they wouldn't understand. The kids today wouldn't... Go on.
GG: But it must have had a certain impact, given the background that you've described.
DW: You wanted me to... Go on.
GG: I would like to hear...
DW: No, no, no. My point is, I called... Oh, I told you about that little child that died...
GG: Yes.
DW: ...when I was ten years old. At ten years old, when I was ten, I left the school where they called me nigger and went to the Latin School. At ten years old, this child came into... I was the youngest, and I never wanted to be young. At ten years old, two children came into my house that were younger, so I was no longer the littlest one, and the little girl grew very attached to me, and I was her mother. And I loved that. So that therefore, although that happened to turn out to be one of my saddest years, I would say, when I was ten, that was the happiest year of my life, as you can well understand. And I saw, of the Russian experience, that was the most carefree year of my life, because my father died before I left Moscow, and I remember, I said to somebody, a friend of mine, "This is the end of my girlhood." And it was, you see. But, so that, yes, the Russian experience, that was the most carefree year of my life.
GG: But what was so significant about it?
DW: Do you know why we went? You know why we went, don't you?
GG: No.﻿64
DW: Moscow, Russia...was going to do a movie. Well, then I'll tell
you a little more about myself. Shall I tell you something about myself? All right. And then you'll see how I figured... I was living with Helen. We were living in an apartment.
GG: This was in New York?
DW: This was in New York. It was in New York. And now you'll see why
I saw this. And she was with the Fellowship of Youth and Reconciliation something—Peace and Reconciliation—it doesn't make any difference. All right, and then you will get the significance of this. I was going with a writer—she was always a recluse and whatever. Life was a little wild at that time. I mean, everybody drank too much, and so forth, because sometimes...
GG: Are we now talking...in the twenties again? We're back to the twenties?
DW: Well, the beginning thirties. In the thirties. Because I went to Russia in '35 or something, so this was the beginning thirties.
GG: Life was a little wild, you said.
DW: That's right. Suddenly I couldn't take it any more. Something happened to me. And what I mean by this, I went to a party, and the next morning I felt a little ill—this is all psychological—and I couldn't get up. I don't mean I couldn't move; I just couldn't... I went to the doctor's, there was nothing wrong with me, and so forth and so on. And there wasn't. It was psychosomatic. I mean, I just didn't want to go out into the corrupt world any more. All right. So then, one day... Oh, and Henry Moon—do you know Henry Moon?—Henry Moon was in love with me, and so forth and so on. He even asked me to marry him, but not at this particular time. He asked me to marry him in Russia. But at any rate, I'm going to now bring Henry Moon into the picture in a moment. The phone rang, and a nice young, clean voice said to me, "May I speak to Helen?" And I said, "She's not here." "Oh." But she said, "Where is she?" I said, "I don't know." 'Cause Helen was the kind of person who'd buy herself four doughnuts and go sit down at the Battery and stare at the water all day. She did that here, just go and sit and stare at the water all day. All right. But she's brilliant, don't misunderstand me. So that therefore, she said, "Well, who are you?" And I said, "I'm her cousin." "Well," she said, "could you do me a great favor?" And don't forget, I'm attracted to this voice, you know what I mean, I mean, it's just a nice, simple person. And I'd been with, oh God, so many sophisticated people, and so on. So that therefore, I don't mind, God directed me. And I said, Yes, I would come and address envelopes.
So I went down to this Fellowship of Youth and something, whatever it was, one of those noble peace organizations, and I addressed envelopes. They liked me. They were going to have a meeting, and﻿65
DW: (cont.) asked if I would pass out leaflets or programs or something, at this meeting. And again I said yes. And the reason I said it, because these were sane people. So I went to the meeting, and Henry Moon was there—and the meeting was about Russia. Oh, God. I think it was about...I don't know what the meeting was about. But at any rate, Henry Moon met me. He felt that I was running around too much, and so forth and so on. He asked me if I wanted to go to Russia, and you will understand me. I said, "No! The last place I want to go is to Communist Russia, because the Russian writers... And I know everything is changed," and so forth and so on. And he said, "But you should go, just to get away," and so forth and so on. And so then, he probably told me that they were having a meeting. Now I'm not sure, but I talked about this organization. You can call it a lecture if you want; I really don't remember. I did go to the meeting at a private house, and Henry was there, and they talked about going to Russia. The Russians wanted to make a movie...
GG: I believe I read about it in Langston's book, The Big Sea.
DW: Yes. All right. The Russians wanted to make a movie about how
badly the blacks were treated in America. All right. At that time America had not recognized Russia. They had...
GG: Invited several people, and they were to come.
DW: No. Yes. Wait a minute. They had invited the actors and actresses, and these actors and actresses said, "Not a chance," because there was no contract offered to them. You had to pay your own way over, and you were going to sign the contract when you got back. So no actors... there was not a live actor in the group. So then they began to recruit other people, writers, and so on. They went, understandably, for the adventure, you see. As I said, Henry persuaded me to go; so that's how I got to go. As a matter of fact, as I recall, Henry gave me some money for my passage, helped me. I can't remember. But I did go, and none of us had any money. I think I landed in Russia with twenty dollars. But they did sign the contract. And as you probably know, Langston... They said it was the most incredible script that ever was. And Langston worked on the script. He tried to make something.
Do you know Russia at all? Do you know the Dneprostroi Dam? Well, Hugh Cooper—I'll never forget, Hugh Cooper was an American engineer who was building the Dneprostroi Dam for the Russians. And you remember, Russia had no... America had not... Yes, because I don't know how you'd feel, how one feels. There were, as I mentioned, many trials in Russia at that time. Germans, French, Americans, and so forth and so on, non-Communists of course, who did a great deal of sabotage. But the Russians needed their skills, you see. And it's true, there was a trial every month. So this Hugh Cooper was the American who was building that incredible dam. 'Cause I wrote about it, I wrote a lyric poem to the Dneprostroi Dam. I hate﻿66
DW: (cont.) machines. And yet for some reason or other, I went there. And I don't know, I was just so impressed, with the water and the power, and I said, "Sing, machines, sing," or something like that. I'll show it to you some day. But at any rate, Russia sent us on a trip. Oh, the movie. This was while we were waiting for the movie, and so forth and so on. They would get the script ready, and you go on this lovely, this beautiful trip. Henry Moon could not go because he was ill, and another man... Henry and this other man, I've forgotten, were in a bar one night when they overheard Hugh Cooper say that if the Russians went ahead and made this movie denigrating the way America treated the blacks, he would never finish the dam. And so that therefore, all right.
So now we are having a meeting with the Russians. We are having a meeting... Oh, we are in a desert, let me say, far away. And the Russians say to us, I mean, our peredverchik, our interpreters, say to us, "We can't make the movie because this condition is wrong and that condition is wrong, and we suggest that we send for your things," they're in Moscow—this had all been planned—"and then you can go home." All right. Very dramatic. There's a knock on the door, and you know, and so the Russians go to the door, and I'll
never forget, this very dramatic___ Because Henry is a usually
mild, soft-spoken man. And Henry comes into the room with this other man, and he says, "Comrades of the..." or something, "we have been screwed by Mezrapom," the name of the film company. So then he told the group of Russians that were with us, he told them to get out, because Henry wanted to talk to us. So they got up, and we locked the door. He said in a loud voice... Because this is true, I'm sure, about Russia. I mean, I know that, because something happened and in five minutes the police were there. Something happened to me, a friend of mine called me and said she was committing suicide, and oh, boy.
Well, at any rate, we said aloud, "We don't care if you're listening," and so forth. And then Henry told us what we had heard, and this is very interesting. Do you know what a hard train is? A hard train and a soft train? A hard train is literally, you have seen the Russian movies where they are sleeping on the hard trains? "Well, we will go back to Moscow on a hard train, if it's necessary, and we will go and confront Mezrapom, the film company that asked us to come over," and so forth and so on. And the interesting thing is—'cause I have this in my diary too—journal, I don't write diaries, I write journals—we were a united group. Twenty-two united people. And maybe other people knew more than I did. So we went to Mezrapom, and had this confrontation with them. They offered us tea and cakes. And we would not accept it. But the point is, what happened was, there were some Communists in the group. And so they took the... We didn't know that. I didn't know it. We thought we were twenty-two blacks. But when we got to the meeting, we were three or four Communists, three sympathizers, and one thing or another. So the meeting broke up, and that﻿67
DW: (cont.) night... Now this is where it's psychological with me, I don't know. We had the "son-of-a-bitch meeting." Didn't Lang-ston write about that?
GG: Well, there were references to it, but I don't remember...
DW: We had the "son-of-a-bitch meeting," in which we were supposed to
tell each other what we felt about each other. And for some reason or other, I was ill and couldn't go. I was menstruating, and... Well, maybe I couldn't help it. Maybe nervousness. I was flowing too much to go. All right. And so they had the "son-of-a-bitch meeting." Henry and this other man came in my room and told me about the meeting. Oh. They were going back to America, and somebody else was going to Paris.
GG: Well, why was everybody in the group furious with each other if the decision was the Russians'?
DW: Oh, because at that meeting that we had in Odessa, we were united. We were going back to Mezrapom, they had said, "We are going to make that movie to show how badly the blacks are treated in America We were going to force them to make the movie more accurate. But then when they... There is a Communist line, and the Communists ...then we divided, because when they said what they had to say, the Communists said, "Well, so we'll go along with them." And then the Communist sympathizers—what do they call them at those— I've forgotten. They took the Communist line, too. So we split down the middle. We were a split group. And then we decided, all right then, we'll call a spade a spade. We're going to have the "son-of-a-bitch meeting." And I mean, as I say, that was the title we gave it, too. "Let's have a son-of-a-bitch..." Be.cause we began to squabble there, you see. So the meeting came to an end
GG: And everybody went back.
DW: And everybody went back. We all lived in one hotel. Then I guess we went from room to room and said, "Let's settle this thing by having a 'son-of-a-bitch meeting,' and we will say what we want to say to each other." And we did have the "son-of-a-bitch meeting." Because we were all a little afraid of our families back home, because they didn't know what was happening, 'cause the stories were flying back to America. And I think we were all writing reassuring, "Nobody's killing us. We're not on the block." And that's what happened, and it really had to do with the dam, because Hugh Cooper said that they wouldn't have finished the dam if they didn't change the script. Didn't Langston describe the script?
GG: No, I don't think so.
DW: Absolutely ridiculous. The blacks in America... It was written in the Russian style. My point is, they did not really know the conditions, because there were some blacks... Now I'm talking about﻿68
GG: Let me ask you this, they had writers in the group, Dorothy, right? Why didn't they give the writers the chance to write the script?
DW: Well, no, no, no. Don't forget, they had written the script. You said they had writers in the group. You've forgotten. They wrote the script in Russia, and tried to get American actors, black actors...
GG: To perform. But they didn't, so then they brought the writers.
DW: So that therefore, yes. But the script had already been written
when they brought the writers, and it was because they were writers that they said, "My God, this is not the way life is lived in America." You see what I mean? And so that's what happened. And because Langston was a writer...
GG: He could see through...
DW: Well, no. Well, because he was a writer, they asked him to work
on the script. And then he worked on the script, and it was still ...it was a little better. Oh, because the point is that you have seen this in the Russian movies. But you have never seen it in American movies. So now they have this great party, in America...
GG: This is in the script?
DW: This is the script. They have a great party in America.
GG: What do you mean by a great party?
DW: Oh, they have a big, beautiful party down in the South. All right. And as I say, this is taken exactly from a Russian movie. So there is a servant girl, a little black servant girl serving them. The young man of the household, or whatever, is overtaken by her beauty, and he makes her put down the tray, and they dance together all around the room. Now, you know they don't do that! All right. Then there's trouble in the South, and there are blacks up here— this is forty years ago—who own radio, television stations; the black radio stations up here alert all the black people in the country and they call for militia, and they go down South and shoot up people. It was the most ridiculous, they tell me it was the most ridiculous script that was ever... Nothing was true to life. I mean, nothing was possible.
GG: Based on the historical reality.
DW: They were based on their Russian movies...the peasants, they were based on the peasants and the upper classes. But I mean, it was a whole different sort of thing. Because I had seen Russian movies where this beautiful peasant girl and the young... I think I saw one, it may have been last year, and so forth. Beautiful movie I saw. But I mean, it just wasn't like that; it wasn't done here.﻿69
DW: (cont.) And then of course, we split up. I stayed on in Russia, and I told you that was my very happy year. I got a little contract with one of the movie studios, which was written kind of funny. I told you that.
GG: No, no.
DW: Oh. They were making a movie laid, oh, maybe a hundred years ago. It was so interesting to me because I was young and attractive, a young girl. However, this was a princess or something, and I was her maid. And it just tickled me to pieces, that they... And I had a charming little... Oh, I didn't tell you about burning my breast? I told you about burning my...
GG: No, you didn't.
DW: All right.
GG: Now you had a contract to work as a writer?
DW: My perevodchik, means translator, this woman happened to be very
fond of me. I wanted to stay on in Russia, and because when you're young, you expect people to do things for you, so she got this contract for me, with this... I'm black, which is different, and I understand that after I left Russia, my picture—I never finished the movie, but my picture was all over. They said, "Come on, come and see this movie." All right. So Ostarovna, she got me this contract, and I went to work in this movie. And then about burning my breast. All right. So then we had a very cold period when the temperature went down to 26 below zero. Later, the big studios were bombed. I mean, you can imagine how cold it was. I lived in the hotel with central heating. I went to stay with a friend who did not have central heating, so when I came back I had a bad cold. Because I don't have any sense, I called somebody and said, "What should I do?" They said, "Put a mustard plaster on." All night I tossed and turned, 'cause it was...I burned my breast. And she had made me this beautiful little costume.
So I went back, and she spoke French to me, a bit slowly, and I understood. I spoke English to her. So I said to her,"Madame, I have burned my breast." I took off my coat. I had burned my... She stood there. She yelled and she screamed, and she spoke French so rapidly, I did not...I think she went into Russian. She was so mad with me, she took me by the hand and took me down to the wardrobe, and I guess she said, "Look here, she's burned her breast." But I must say, I thought I told you this. I will die. And the undertaker will... I will be, I am an old lady. He will see that there's still some burn, and he'll say, "What in the heck happened to her?" "Once, when I was in my early twenties in Russia, I burned my breast." And it is so funny, 'cause he will never, the undertaker will never guess. "How did..." He will think that the old lady leaned against a... No, I was a young girl, who put a mustard plaster on.﻿70
GG: DW: GG: DW:
GG: DW: GG: DW:
GG: DW:
And left it... What was it, that you left it on so long? In the first place, I understand you don't do it like that. You put it on your back?
No, no, no. 'Cause I put it on my chest. But I think—what was I told? You don't just put the bare, hot mustard...I think you do something to your chest first or something. I did it all wrong. I did it all wrong, and burned my breast, and so forth and so on. But then 1 didn't tell you about leaving Russia? Because I never will forget this as long as I live. Then, Langston and another friend of mine, we wanted to go to China. So I called my—I never will forget this—I called my... Oh, I told you about how, oh, that he told me I was a good actor? I told you all that.
Who was this now?
The director.
No, I don't remember that.
All right. So we are making the movie. Yes, I had burned my breast. Oh, yes, because we were on... Oh, it was interesting. Because I do this scene. And he says, "Do this," and I do this. And, "Do that," and I do that. And I remember saying to myself, "So that... Because I don't know how much you know about actors, but there is always that discussion, who is the important person, the director or the actor? And I remember that morning saying, "Then it is the director, because he's telling me everything to do, and I'm doing it." Then we broke for lunch, and he asked me to stay. And I said, "Oh, God, what did I do wrong?" And he said to me—I never will forget—I thought I told you, he said, "Do you want to be an actor?" And you know me, I said, "No, no, no, I don't want to be an actor, because you see, I want to be a writer." I meant, I was apologizing. So he asked me something again, and then he said, "Do you know that you have the makings of an excellent actress, a good actress?" and so forth and so on. And he talked to me—this is crazy—and I thanked him. Now I can't tell you why... Well, I can tell you why. Because I knew that I was not a great actress. So I went to the phone, and I called my peredverchik, and I said, "Doris, I want you to break my contract." "Why?" And I said, "Well, now, we had talked about going to...
China.
...China." And I said, "Because Mildred and Langston and I want to fly to China." And as long as I live...she was a white Russian—you know what I mean by a white Russian—and I never will forget as long as I live, she said, "Are you birds, that you will fly to China?" And the reason I remember that is, in a few short days or weeks, my father died; my wings were clipped. All right.﻿71
DW: (cont.) I mean, she said it with such sadness and yearning,
"Are you going..." And then she said, "What can I say?" And this is just kind of funny. And I said, "Tell her that I'm pregnant." Then she... "Well, who is it?" I said, "Oh, Doris, I'm just saying that. I'm just saying that." And the point is, I never went back to the studio. And I don't know what she told them or whatever.
GG: Well, what was it? You were suspicious that they were, it was a come-on?
DW: No! Maybe you don't know me. Maybe it's because I'm a perfectionist. I don't like praise. I don't like praise. I think that's it. I used to say to my mother, "Can't you tell me what's good?" and she would get so mad and blush and so forth and so on. "Why are you always telling me just the bad? Why don't you tell me the good?" And she would say, "Well, you know the good. I don't have to tell you about that." So I'm not used to your telling me the good. I thought...because don't forget, I thought that he was going to tell me that I did this wrong, that wrong, the other wrong. I was prepared for that.
GG: Yes. Socialized to expect criticism.
DW: That's a good phrase. Socialized. Yes, by my mother, father...
I do the same thing to the kids. I said to myself... My God! And I know Abigail came to my house, she had an errand to do for me, and I know she said to her husband, "Oh, she..." And she came back and said to me, "I didn't mean to say it." I said, "Abby, you're beautiful." Because when I said, "Abigail, Abigail, we can't help it." I think it came from my grandmother. I mean, I never saw her—she died before I was born. And I didn't like my grandmother, because I thought she might not like me because... And my mother was always telling us about the things that my grandmother said, and so forth and so on. But I mean, I know now that that was my grandmother's way, just as it was my mother's way, and just as it is my way. Because I can't... Don't misunderstand me, I can tell you. Because I was going to say something nice about your face—I like your face—a bit ago. But with the kids in our family, I don't know why we can't.
GG: Well, it's your notion of how you have to train young people. My father used to be very critical.
DW: Oh, all right. I see.
GG: And I used to say, well, you know, "Do I have to hear the criticisms?"
DW: Oh, you went through the same thing.
GG: So I know. And his point was that that's the way he helped children shape up.﻿72
DW: I don't mind, now that I'm grown... I mean, I'm all right, aren't I?
GG: Yes, I think so.
DW: All right. But you see, so that that didn't hurt me.
GG: Well, I don't know. That's hard. That's a hard question to answer.
DW: Yes. Because I don't know how I would have been otherwise, if she had praised me...
GG: Now. I'm going to ask you another question, which you don't necessarily have to answer. You said, for instance, that Henry Moon asked you to marry him. He wanted to marry you, and I think that somewhere else you said...
DW: I remember the whole thing. You know why?
GG: Claude McKay, I think you said, wanted to marry you. Now what was it there, about both men that you didn't find attractive and you decided you...
[break]
DW: I'm not making excuses, but I really love Mollie.
GG: Yes, she is quite a person.
DW: Except that you remember when she sued Bobo Rockefeller?
GG: No.
DW: You don't? They settled the case out of court, and Molliegot quite a nice bit of money. All right. The point is, you know Zora Neale Hurston? I knew and loved Zora, and I went to see Zora one day... Did you want to hear this?
GG: Yes. But don't forget you're going to answer my question.
DW: About Henry? Well, that's why I'm bringing in Mollie, 'cause they're married.
GG: All right.
DW: All right. This is most interesting. At seventeen years old,
Molliehad married, 'cause she was a beautiful girl, and so on and so on, and her husband had divorced her. She lived in a small town, and Zora knew her, and had said, "Come on, Mollie, come to New York," and so forth and so on. But Zora is like my cousin Helen, crazy.﻿73
DW: (cont.) Then maybe a week or two later I went to see Zora.
There was Mollie by herself. Zora had received a grant, and had gone off to Haiti or someplace, and it was Easter. And Mollie was by herself, because she had—I don't know what I had said to her, but Zora had not had time to introduce her to anyone. Don't forget, I am young. We are all young, and when you're young you think to get in a whole lot of foolishness that I can't do now. I don't even want anybody in my house, I want to live by myself now! [laughter] But at any rate, I said to—I think I was living with a friend of my mother's—it doesn't make any difference—I said, "Well, come on up, have Easter with me, Mollie," or something, I can't remember.
But at any rate, Mollie went with me, and we went to a party. I remember that at that time, there was an international set, and I sat on...he pulled me down on his lap for some reason. It doesn't make any difference. His name was John Brown, but he was a really large... And there were all of these people. And Mollie* was thrilled. I'll never forget, she was thrilled. I mean, that was Mollie's... She had not known that such people existed, and...all right, a cosmopolitan group existed. So she liked it, and then, gradually, she met many people.
Mollie and I took an apartment on the same floor. And I say, this is just a little aside, we knew Zora very well. We called her Sister. Because she was always, she used to snoop. Not me, I think she loved me. But she didn't quite trust Mollie. And so we always felt that she quietly came down the hall and listened. And you know, she practiced voodoo? You know, the sorcery? And see, Mollie believed in all that myth, so she swore that Zora was practicing voodoo on her.
But I bring out this to you, because Mollie was a kind of a wild one. And Henry...the thing that is so damned ironic is that Henry wanted me to get away from Mollie.
Henry... This particular day was very hot. I don't like the heat. And I know that he and I were sitting at a little table, I don't know if we had lunch, and I kept ordering water. And so I was hot. And the reason I say this is, I don't think I would have said yes if I had been cool, but at any rate, the last thing I wanted to do was discuss marriage. And the interesting thing was, the reason Henry wanted to marry me, he thought I was a lovely person...he still thought I was a virgin, I think. He thought I was a... Oh, I stopped being a virgin, oh, my God! [laughter] But he had been brought up in towns where there were only whites. And I think he more or less told me this at this time, and so that therefore, my looks were exactly what he wanted, you see. But Henry, well, I didn't want to...if I had married Henry, I would be in bed with him, and I was just sick of all that. Well, I didn't feel well then. He picked the wrong time to ask me! Never thought about anything that disturbed me. This is—what, thirty or forty﻿74
DW: (cont.) years later—and it has always disturbed me. I was going with a very handsome man; David Collum was a handsome man, and I didn't care for him. But at any rate, Henry knew that. He came to my party, and he said to me, "You only like beautiful people." And it upset me! But I tell you this, this is something that...maybe you will understand what I am saying. It isn't that I only like beautiful people, it's just that beauty... Because I had a friend who thought I was crazy. Ten beautiful people could pass me, and then one plain person could pass me, I'd say, "Isn't she ugly." I don't notice, I accept... Do you see what I'm saying? I accept beauty. I mean, beauty is something that I expect people to be.
GG: You take them for granted.
DW: I take them for granted.
GG: Well, I was just curious, that since you had so many opportunities, why you chose not to get married...
DW: I feel I was afraid of marriage. Oh, wait a minute. Let me tell
you something that my family used to say when I was a child. "Rachel, you should not talk like that before this child. Shelll never get married." Now what she said that I retain, I don't know.
GG: You're afraid of it.
DW: When I said afraid of it, don't misunderstand me. You remember I said that my father..."my mother's not been a good wife." I think I wasn't sure I would be a good wife, number one. I was not the raving beauty in the world. When I was about forty-five, some millionaire asked me to marry him and I would not do it. All right. But my point is, I think that I did not know that I could marry a poor man. Because what would I do about the family? Do you see what I mean? I think that I had a great sense of responsibility, because my father... I mean, there was always, there were always people in there. Because I had a beautiful room. And I used to hurt my mother's feelings, so she would sometimes... I said, "What room? I said, "Every time I came home from the school, you said to me, 'Dorothy, do you mind sleeping in so-and-so? Because this mother and these three children...'" 'Cause in those days you could put children at the foot of the bed, with some people sleeping at the foot of the bed, and some people...you see? This young boy was very fair—I never knew...again, maybe he was... Many people are attracted to my dark skin—I don't know why. And he wanted to marry me, and he wanted to be part of my family, you see. I think he liked my family. And I said, "We're too young." And I must say that he did want to be married, because I believe he got married the next year. A seventeen-year-old boy got married—I don't know to whom. That's what I remember.
So I don't know. And I cannot tell you why, except that...unless I've told you why. Now this is what I have sort of thought. I've said to myself, "Why is it that I could never choose? Why is it﻿75
DW: (cont.) that I always get involved with two people?" Because
I tell you why. Nothing to do with men. I remember saying just ^ilast night when we were looking at the menu, and I said, "I don't know what I want." I said, "I hate choices. 'Cause I can never decide. Then I end up not wanting anything." I go into a store to buy a dress. I'm coming to see you, I've got to have a dress. And I go to the store, I see the red dress and the blue dress and ...and she says, "May I help you?" And I say, "No, I'll come back tomorrow." And I think maybe that's it. But I think I deliberately maneuvered myself into situations. Because I remember saying to myself—this is off the record—"I will say yes to Langston Hughes." And I never said... And circumstances, and so forth and so on. I never really wanted...I think this, too. Don't forget the family that I came from. And I think that I did not want to be... And sometimes I say to people, "Listen. My mother was the bossiest woman I ever knew." So that therefore, I resisted her, and so forth and so on. I mean, somebody will say to me, "Adelaide!" She's bossy. And she thinks she bosses me, you see, and I let her think so. But I have been bossed by a real boss— my mother. Because—you don't remember this, but I did write about my mother in The Living Is Easy. One of the lines in my story was, "She was the boss of everything and the boss of nothing." That was one of the closing lines of my story. [laughter] And my mother did figure largely in that. The reason I say that is, about a few years ago, a young girl in Boston University thought that she was challenging me, and she said, "If you had to write that story again, would you write it the same way?" And she thought I would say, "Of course I would!" I said, "I don't know. I probably would not." Because my mother has many virtues. My mother was alive when I wrote that story. I didn't see any of her virtues when I... [laughter] Because it's so funny. Everything I say about my mother—I think perhaps you are bright enough to know—I didn't feel this way when she was alive.
GG:	Oh, no.
DW:	Oh, well, all right. Oh, my God, no!
GG:	Well, I certainly want to thank you for shar...
DW:	Oh, I didn't bring my watch.
GG:	It's one. Are you supposed to be six other places?
DW: No. This is my day off. Genii—ten, eleven, twelve, one...have I bored you?
GG: No, you haven't. As a matter of fact, I was just about to say a profound thank you for your having... You know, I really feel that you've shared in a very wholesome, warm kind of way. And I want to thank you very much, for myself and everybody else who uses the material that we shared together.﻿
