Dorothy R. Robinson:	The following is a taped interview of Mrs. Christia
V. Adair of Houston, Texas. The date is April 25, 1977. The interviewer is Mrs. Dorothy R. Robinson of Palestine, Texas, and the interview is being conducted to collect data for the Black Women Oral History Project under the sponsorship of the Schles-inger Library of Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Mrs. Adair, on behalf of the Black Women Oral History Project that's being conducted by the Schlesinger Library, I want to thank you for lending yourself to this interview. I haven't known you personally over a long period of time but through the years, I've read about you and heard about you over the radio and I've seen some of your activities on TV. I know you're certainly one of the most interesting subjects that this project could have and the fact that you are participating is really an honor. I'm sure it will serve as an inspiration to persons who will read about you. Your life has been so interesting and your activities have been so varied, I've really had difficulty in organizing the method that I will use in trying to conduct this interview.
But first, let's go back to your early life. Go back into your ancestry, whatever you can tell us about your parents or your grandparents or any information that you heard them pass down about slavery, just as far back as you can go. We would really be interested in hearing about it.
Christia Adair:	Mrs. Robinson, I know so little about any of my
grandparents because my grandparents died before I was born. My paternal grandfather died after I was born, but I was still an infant when he died, but the other grandparents ... My mother was reared by godparents.
My mother was of a mixed parentage. Her father was an American Caucasian white man. But he must have been in love with my grandmother because she died in childbirth and left him with two little girls and he could have walked off and left them. He could have just forgotten about them, but he kept them. The baby died, but he kept this little four-year-old girl until time came when he found out that he couldn't leave her with her mother's﻿2
(cont) people, because everybody was not good to her, and he kept trying, until finally he found a way. There was a couple who pledged themselves, through her baptism in the Methodist Church, to take her and rear her as their child. He always supported her and tried to leave what little he had for her education or whatnot, but after he was dead somebody came up and played the role of a cousin or brother or something, and in Victoria the lawyers agreed with him and took everything away from the child. So she had a struggle, but these godparents were my grandparents, real grandparents to me because that's all I knew.
As I said, my father's parents died. His mother died before I was born but his father was a hauler. He lived in a rural community called Texana in Jackson County and he had a hauling business. Few people would remember what a dray was like, but a dray was a two-wheel vehicle that people used for carrying, hauling heavy things, and he did haul everything. But when he was on his sick-bed, he had my daddy to take over the business. When he died, that became my father's business. We moved from Victoria to Edna which was my father's home.
I was reared in Edna, a small town, still is, but it made such a contribution to my life and to my brothers and sisters till I, all that I am or hope to ever be, if that is anything, I owe it to Edna, Texas, this small town.
My early life was ... I was blessed with grandparents who were my mother's godparents. And then my mother was impressive to people in Victoria. There was a man named Professor John W. Frazier who came to Victoria from North Carolina, Greensboro, and taught there seven years, then went back to Hamlet, South Carolina,and married his girlfriend, I guess. So then they both were in Victoria. My mother grew up and married and when she became pregnant they asked her - they were kind of middle-aged people before they were married, but they didn't think they were going to have any children - they asked my parents if the baby was a girl, if they might have it, take the vows for godparents and that was understood. So when the baby was on its way, my father got word to my godmother and she came right on. I'm telling this b ecause I think it was a kind of an endowment or benediction or something to my life that I didn't know anything about until after I was 11 years old. But my godmother came and brought a little Testament and stood by and as soon as my right hand opened on its own strength and closed, it closed on this Testament. And she prayed and gave a benediction that this child would grow up to be a useful woman and a devout Christian. I don't know ...my mother said that she watched me grow up. They didn't tell me about this occasion until, as I said, I was nearly 11 or, around 11 years old, because I professed religion at 11. Then my mother let me know that what they expected of me was to reach this prayer and benediction that my godmother had made, because they all hoped the same thing.
Mrs. Adair, that is extremely interesting. Now I believe that you mentioned that you were born in Victoria, Texas, which is near Edna. If you don't mind, would you give us the date of your birth?
I was born on a Saturday morning, October 22nd, 1893.﻿3
DRR:	Thank you so very much. All right, you mentioned a Professor and Mrs.
Frazier who were your godparents and that they had come from South Carolina. Do you want to tell us more about their influence on your life and also, if you would tell us something about your very early education, like first and second grade. Did you go to school in Edna or where? If you'll tie those two together, your very early education and some more about the influence on your life of the Fraziers.
CA:	I went to public school in Edna, Texas, until I was about ... My god-
father came to Edna and he was not too satisfied with the quality of education that the school offered for me, and he wanted my parents to let me go to Samuel Houston College. Maybe I should say this first, that my godfather was one of the co-founders of Samuel Houston College which was a Freedmen Aid school supported by the Methodist Church, and along with Dr. R. S. Lovingood, that school was founded in 1900. And in 1910, I went to school. I had a brother, there's 17 months difference in our ages, and our parents didn't want us separated. So my godfather admonished them to let both of us ... My daddy was pretty worried. It was quite a struggle for him as a poor man, but he let us both go to Austin to go to school at Sam Houston. We did our elementary and high school work in Sam Houston. It was called college then but of course now it would be just an academic school. And Sam Houston College in later years became a part of what is now Houston-Tillotson College through the merger.
DRR:	Thank you, Mrs. Adair. You made reference to the fact that a brother
went with you to Sam Houston College. I'd like to know if you had other sisters and brothers. And I'd also like to know if the brother who went with you still lives and what have been some of the things that he has done with his life? Thank you.
CA:	i had two brothers. I think one of the most noble things about a
woman, I can boast of about my mother. When she married my father, he had a child out of wedlock. And she wanted this little girl because she knew she would want children in her life, and she would want this little girl to be reared just like she would want her children reared. So she did everything that she possibly could that was just and right to get this little girl, and finally the mother did consent for her to take her and adopt her. She legally adopted her. I still have the adoption papers written in pen and ink by a lawyer. But anyway, my mother reared this little girl just as she reared me, with the same principles, the same admonitions. We loved each other and she was a lovely sister and we loved each other very dearly. You know we must have, when I tell you that I did not know until I was quite a big girl, that she was not my mother's child. And finally, when my mother and sister discovered that somebody was going to keep trying until they did convince me, then they told me the story of the adoption. But my mother's admonition was, "That's still your sister. You still obey her as your big sister and do just as you've always done," and that was the way of life.
Then, after ten years another baby came in our home, another little boy. Both my brothers and my sister died. My sister died in '48. She﻿A
(cont) had one daughter and that daughter has 13 children. And so her children, she and her children are what I have left because both my brothers are dead. My younger brother died in May of '76. My older brother was mechanical minded and he always followed the line of working with automobiles and things like that. My younger brother was head maintenance man of a high-rise project here in Houston. They did not follow any professional line but they were both wonderful husbands, wonderful brothers and, I thought, very good men.
Very interesting, Mrs. Adair. Please let me exercise a privilege that I indicated early I might need to do. As I said, your life has been so varied, it's been very difficult for me to sort of structure these questions in what would be a logical sequence, so let me back up a minute. Two things, number one, quite early you said that your mother, when your mother was a child, that it was necessary for her to change homes or something and I wondered just why. I think you indicated in a private conversation with me that there might have been some problems because of color and if that is really what you meant, I wish you would discuss that. That's number one, and then also you mentioned the fact that your mother insisted that your half-sister be reared by the same principles that you were reared. If you feel like it, would you go in detail and tell us something about how your mother and your father managed to get over to you and your sisters and brothers the kinds of principles that they did instill in you. Thank you.
Yes, my mother, as I said, to begin with, was of mixed parentage. There was a time when Negro children who were of a mulatto color or very fair, were not looked upon and loved like children of darker skin. They pulled her hair and made fun of her and used vulgar language to her about her parentage and things like that. So she was always unhappy because they didn't seem to love her and care for her and would give her ugly names. That was why her father had such a time getting her placed, because he wanted her to be happy and he wanted people to love her and he wanted her to love people.
Now, my mother and my father were, when you think of academic-wise, both illiterate but they both had high ideals. I guess my grandfather who gave my father this hauling business must have had high ideals, because he seemed to have been a man of influence in the county. However, I don't know anything about his background very much because I don't know many of the people. I don't know the older relatives in the family. But I know that my father, for instance, would say to me, well, let me say this — my mother told my sister, and then when I became of age (my sister was seven years older than I was), she would tell my sister, "If you get a whipping in school, you're going to get one when you get home. Girls, don't get whipped by other people. Nobody whips you. Your daddy don't whip you, so I am the only person to whip you, but you're going to get whipped." And we never were afraid of that teacher's whipping, we were afraid of that whipping that Mama would give us because we knew that she put up a pretty good job of whipping.
So then, and my daddy, if I got a whipping, and my papa came home for﻿5
(cont) something, well, there wasn't anything about me that would demonstrate it, but my mama would slip around and tell him, "I had to whip Sister." Then he would say, "What is the matter with you?" And I'd say, "Nothing." Very spunky. But he'd keep saying, "Oh yes, there's something the matter," till finally I'd go crying, "Mama whipped me." Well, then he would talk about that whipping as if it was a disgrace, the very fact that his daughter got a whipping. And I guess he had done that same thing about my sister coming up in her younger day. But my sister was a lot of help to my mother, because there were things that she knew how Mama felt about things, and she would pass these things on to me. I couldn't get by with doing little childish pranks any more with her knowing it than I could with my mama because I ... It looked like, I mean I had two mamas. At that time, I was a child, I didn't appreciate it, and thought I didn't love my sister because she was always on me. But I know now that it meant everything to me to have Mama and a sister at the same time.
Mrs. Adair, I'm remembering something we discussed in an earlier conversation. I believe you mentioned the fact that you played with dolls so long that your mother was really disturbed about it, but later on in life you felt that you had an understanding about this that had some psychological implications. Would you discuss that please.
Yes. My sister put dolls down at an earlier age and took on big girl activities, but I was 10 or 11 years old before I stopped playing dolls. I loved dolls. Everybody knew I did and everybody was giving me dolls. I just had plenty of dolls. I learned to sew because Mama wouldn't let me mess up things. She would make me do it right and I learned to sew playing with these dolls. But Mama said that she would watch me from time to time. Sometimes these dolls would be my children and I would be the mama and she even heard me talking to the child about a daddy. She wondered where I was getting all that - a father. Anyway she said that then as I grew, I mean there would be other times that she would see me, have them lined up in front of me and I would be lecturing to them and teaching them like school and all, admonishing them and punishing them just like she would punish me and give them, my dolls, the same advice that she'd given me.
Finally when I did give up the dolls, my interest turned to small children. With this little brother who came after I was ten years old, I was his nurse. He seemed to have clung to me because Mama would be busy with other things and she'd just turn that over to me. After fooling with these dolls until I was a big girl and then having this little real brother plus his little friends, my life was kind of taken up like that.
In a small town like Edna, and I guess in big towns too in those days, church was a paramount issue in the life of people who believed in God. And my mama exposed her children to church activities and we were taught, wherever the need was, to always be available to fill the need. So people didn't mind putting Mama's children on a program or giving Mama's children responsibilities. Other people didn't mind calling on Mama's children to run little errands for them, things like that, because they﻿6
(cont) knew what her idea was about. So I became active in my church as a very small girl, doing whatever was to be done because that's whatever they called on me and, child-like, I got a lot of kick out of being called on to do things and demonstrating what little I knew how to do.
But anyway, we had a Sunday School Superintendent in our little church in Edna, named Miss Beulah White. You see, when I left home to go to school, I was between 15 and 16 years old, which meant that I was still a little girl. But I had been active in my Sunday School and things like that, and my Sunday School Superintendent fell ill with tuberculosis and she, after so long a time, wanted to talk to me. At that time she wanted Mama to bring me home from school so she could talk to me and Mama couldn't do that. But anyhow, as soon as I came home for vacation period, Mama told me about it and had me to go and talk with her. This woman was a very highly cultured and very well prepared woman. And when I went in, the first thing she told me to do was to safeguard myself because she wanted me close to her so I could hear, but she had me to Lake a towel and make a mask out of it around my nose. And she said, "You know I have tuberculosis, don't you?" And I said, "Yes." "Well, I don't want you to catch it, so I want you to listen so I can talk loud to you and you can hear what I'm saying and yet it won't take me long. I wanted you to be Superintendent of the Sunday School." Well, it just took the breath out of me because I couldn't understand how she could ask that of me and I said, "Oh, Miss Beulah, I don't know how to be a Superintendent." "You can learn. I know that's what I want to happen to the Sunday School, when I go. I want you to be the Superintendent of the Sunday School." And she kept plugging after me about it and pressing me and she said, "Will you promise me that you'll be the Sunday School Superintendent?" And I said, "Yes, Miss Beulah." So then she sent me home.
When I got home and told my mama about it, Mama said, "Well, what did you say?" I said, "I couldn't do anything but say 'yes.' She's a dying woman." Mama said, "All right, if you told her yes, you would be Sunday School Superintendent, you are Sunday School Superintendent." I said, "No, Mama, I ..." She said, "But you can't ... you made a promise that you can't break." And so, that meant that at 16 years old, I was Sunday School Superintendent of Scruggs Chapel Methodist Church in Edna, Texas.
In September, when I went back to Sam Houston, I told Professor McNealy, who was the religious education director of our school, what had happened. He said, "All right. We're going to put a lot of time in our class work when we go back after vacation. Edna's going to have a good superintendent." The whole class became interested in that fact, that Christia Daniels was Sunday School Superintendent, and everybody was leaning toward helping me be a good superintendent. And when I went back to Edna in vacation time, I felt that the children wouldn't love me. They would kind of feel like they had been set aside and I had been selected to do something that maybe I wasn't equal to. But I guess everybody's prayers, everybody's admonitions ... The children were glad. Instead of saying, "Christia's superintendent," they said, "We're super-﻿7
CA:	(cont) intendent of our own Sunday School." And together we had a
Sunday School. We didn't know anything to do but read the lesson, sing a song and pray and go home. One or two adults who would come over there all the time would help us with the review. But that's the biggest thing we knew how to do until after two years of it, I learned how to follow the policy of the church where Sunday School was concerned.
DRR:	Mrs. Adair, it seems to get more interesting each time you open your
mouth. I think this is the first time you've mentioned your maiden name. Would you give us your father's whole name and also, I don't believe you've given us your mother's name. And while you're about it, tell us some of the things he hauled in his dray.
CA:	My daddy's name was Handy Daniels. H-a-n-d-y. My mother's maiden
name was Crosby, Ada Crosby Daniels. My father started out with this little two-wheel vehicle that I said, a dray, which only used one horse to it. But he made sides to his dray because he had to haul different kinds of things than what my grandfather had to haul. He was the only person hauling in the county and everything they wanted hauled, they would come to him and he would find one way to make one. He didn't turn down a job that he could use. My daddy took that dray and that one horse and for a number of years, that's what he had. Then he bought wagon beds and took the sides off and made floats which made it broad and wide-based and he hauled everything from bales of cotton to pianos, moving people with furniture and everything. Edna was, Jackson County I should say, was a cotton belt and they had a huge platform where people would bring their bales after they brought their cotton from the gin. They loaded it on this platform. Here people used to buy bales of cotton and the merchants paid cotton samplers. My father watched that go on for some time, then he learned how to sample cotton himself. So when the bales of cotton would come out of the gin, and they would hand out, want a certain grade of cotton or type of cotton or whatever it was, my daddy knew how to go over there and sample that cotton and find the cotton that the man wanted and then haul that cotton from the gin to the cotton platform himself. He was in the cotton business.
Then, some merchants handled different kinds of oil, kerosene and so forth. They hauled that in on trains. My daddy took whatever it took, I guess some kind of credentials, to make yourself responsible for inflammable material. And he would take the merchants' oil containers over to the railroad tracks and change this oil from the railroad tanks into that and then take it back to the merchants. That's how they would sell the customers the coal oil because they had to have it for everything. That's because they had no electricity in our little town; everything was coal oil. And whatever else they used oil for, well they had it, I don't remember the different kinds, whether it was crude oil or what, but I know we didn't have no automobiles so we didn't need that kind of oil. Daddy didn't know anything about gasoline. But my daddy hauled everything that anybody wanted moved. He gave employment to other men because he had three and four different teams going all day, every day, and men had to get employment like that.
He and my mother kind of team-worked together and they decided that if﻿8
CA:	(cont) my mother gave the men breakfast and dinner, it would be
cheaper for him to do it that way than it would be to pay them an adequate salary that would give them the money to do what they had to do, their living conditions. So she did that. It was her contribution, I thought, to the job because she also bought some kind of cotton gingham, something like that, and made jumpers. And every man that left that yard in the morning left with a clean jumper. My mama would wash and iron those jumpers, hang them on a post around the barn where they could get them. And these men ate ... Mama and Papa never did want us to feel like there were barriers between us and other people. Mama didn't feed those men at a separate table. Those men sat down to the table with her children and ate breakfast and dinner. And we had to respect them and they had to respect us and they did respect us, as their children.
Thank you, Mrs. Adair. I'm sure that the people who will read this in future times will enjoy it just as much as I am enjoying it now. I'm finding it extremely interesting. You've mentioned again your father's dray and his hauling business. I have noticed in this copy of the Texas Sampler, that you were kind enough to let me examine, there is a picture of your father and his horse on page 119. And I noticed that this volume, the publication of this volume was funded by the Budget and Planning Committee of the Governor's office. This picture is very interesting to me. In fact the whole chapter is about you and your family. But for the benefit of this interview, would you give us the name of that horse that Handy Daniels used to earn the daily bread for his family.
CA:
DRR:
•CA:
The horse was an unusually large horse. His name was Grant. That horse belonged to a circus that played in our county. My daddy always, I guess from a young man, he was, by natural interest, a veterinarian, I guess, because anybody's cow or horse or dog, anything, Papa could always concoct something that would help. So this circus was in town and something happened to this horse's foot and the circus couldn't use him anymore. My daddy tried to bring him around but he didn't. Anyhow, the circus either gave him to him or must have sold it cheap to him but anyway the horse became Papa's horse. And he had great big feet and was of heavy stature and a big horse, bigger than most mules were in those days and that horse was strong. He could just almost carry the load of an elephant on him, so Papa and old Grant were the breadwinners.
Mrs. Adair, it seems as though we can't get away from your early life. How would you assess your childhood? Would you say your childhood was a happy childhood? I know you felt loved, we can get that from the statements that you've already made. But would you say your childhood was happy or were you ever frustrated or unhappy because of some things perhaps you didn't have, or any other thing that might have influenced your life at that time?
I think I can truthfully say that I have lived my life according to my age. I didn't grow up to be a big girl too soon. I didn't wear woman clothes too soon. My older sister would ... we had a pact between us﻿9
(cont) when Mama would make her dresses, and my mother sewed beautifully. If it was a dress that I liked, then I knew that dress was going to be mine one day. I just watched the time and my sister ... "Sister, be careful.' Don't tear that dress up!" Because I knew the dress was going to be mine, but I had no sensitive feeling about the fact that I was going to get my sister's dress. I never was made to feel like I ought to be the one getting the new dress. My mother just had this attitude about it. Sister was the big girl and the first girl, the first child and she came first with all these other things. So as long as something was good and pretty, well, it was still mine. They weren't going to put anything ragged on me. They weren't going to put anything that wasn't good on me and I was happy to know that ... My mother and father, my mother especially, felt like that, no matter how many other people's children she had at her house, it didn't matter, so long as she had her own at home. And that was her one desire, was to keep her children at home and to let her children know that there wasn't anything that they needed or wanted that home couldn't provide, and there wasn't any problem or anything that they couldn't tell Mama and Papa first. Then we children got that between ourselves. I didn't even go back to Mama with everything. I'd go to my sister. My brother and I would get to whispering some time together. And Mama would want to know what were we talking about and she would pry into our conversation and make out she thought we were talking about her, in order to get out of us. In order to make her know that we were not talking about her, we would up and tell what we talked about. That's all she wanted. But our parents really did provide us with everything that children needed to play with. My brother, from a little boy, my oldest brother was crazy about baseball. And my mother fairly took a piece of ground away from my daddy and made a baseball diamond out of it for my brother. But anything that Mama did was all right with my papa. And anything that Papa did - they agreed with everything. If they didn't agree, we didn't know it. And the children had to respect that fact that if Mama said it, don't ask me. If Papa said it, don't ask me.
Mrs. Adair, I have gathered from your remarks thus far that your family was probably a little better off from an economic point of view than the average family in your community, I suspect, black or white. Would you tell me how correct I might be on that and also, if you can think of any other instances that you feel had a profound effect on your life. I mean experiences you had as a child. You've mentioned the Testament and then your visiting with the dying Sunday School Superintendent. If there are other events that had an impact on your life that you think are worth mentioning, would you please do so. Now, economic comparison with your family and others and significant experiences that had impact on your life.
I mean it isn't easy to compare because Edna is in Jackson County which is quite a farming area, and there were many, many Negro men who owned black land farms and livestock and had lots of money. My daddy had a regular income from his little hauling business. But it was something that my mother always taught her children, that no matter what anybody else has, you take what you have and make it useful. And don't let anything, job or anything else, make you; you make the job. And you﻿10
(cont) make the responsibility count. We knew that my daddy didn't have any money, and Mama would say that we just have so much, and so much money to spend for certain things. Now this month, Sister has to have shoes; next month, Brother can have shoes; next month, Daley can have shoes, and those kinds of things. We had to learn how to use whatever we had. But my daddy wanted his children to have the best of everything.
Naturally, Edna didn't have amusements like other places. In Houston back in those days, they used to have what they called a no tsuoh carnival. It's the word Houston spelled backward. And that went on every fall, I think in November. My mama would have to take my brother and sister. We would have to go. She'd have to bring these children to Houston so they could be exposed to the activities of this carnival and see what that was all about. They had little side shows and things like that would come to our town, little tent shows, and my daddy would always take us to the show.
Th en in Houston, the Ringling Brothers would always have their show in Houston every fall. Well, Mama again would have to bundle her children up and bring them to Houston to take them to the carnival. When we grew up and were grown people, these little carnivals and things like that were of no value to us because we had had our fill of it when we were children and we were doing things that were more of use to us.
I don't know how I might evaluate any specific things. The fact that I mentioned, after my mother and my sister told me about my mother's ambition to get my sister, that always rated to me as a very noble thing in my mother's life, because I knew a lot of stepchildren who were not treated right and were not happy. My sister was happy as I was. My sister's real mother was living right in that little town, but my sister's mama was my mama and that other lady was Mrs. X, just like she was to me.
My sister made an impression on my life too because I grew up knowing that she could have been ugly, she didn't have to be kind to me, she could have b een jealous of me, but she wasn't.
The one thing that impressed me as a child, my father and my mother had a lot of influence in our little town. Nobody set them aside or looked up to them or put them on pedestals or anything like that, but Mama always could get the hearing of other women and my daddy could get the hearing of other people, and white people have always been like some of them are today. They feel like there's always some Negro person that they can use to put over other Negroes what they want to put over. Every once in a while, they would try that where my daddy was concerned because they knew that he had influence over people. Nobody thought he was better. He didn't act like he was better, but he just respected them and demanded respect for himself.
The same thing about my mother, everybody respected Mama's opinion about children and girls and things like that. If a girl became pregnant Mama didn't make us snub that girl, but she did let us know that﻿11
(cont) there was a difference between a girl who had made a mistake and a girl who had kept her chastity.
My father had an interest in education. He knew, before my godfather discovered, that Edna's schools were not the type of schools for his children. He knew that there were things the teachers were doing that they shouldn't do and were discredited. And white people were helping Negro teachers to attend summer normals and were selling them questions and those kinds of things. My father always had a group of Negro men who would go along with him to fight and protest those things. Of course, it was quite an illegal thing to do so. Perhaps he did get a lot of people in trouble, not a lot of them, but some of them, but he broke up what they were doing.
Well, the fact that my parents held that kind of status in our community, I think, had a bearing on me. I always felt like I owed it to my parents and I owed it to myself. I can't do such and so because I'm a Daniels. Well, the feeling that caused this was that I owe this to my family. I've got to reach their expectations and I think that their influence in the community had a lot to do with making me know in my life I owed it to my public to have influence over somebody.
Mrs. Adair, I believe we have you at Sam Houston College at a very early age, perhaps around 15, under the guardianship of your godparents, the Fraziers. Tell us something of what life was like to a 15-year-old at Sam Houston back then. And tell us something about the subjects that you studied and your teachers.
Sam Houston College was just a great big family. I left my own family and went into the influence of another family because Dr. Lovingood and my godparents and Dr. Lovingood's wife didn't look at anybody as being grownup anything. It was just a bunch of children. There were so many girls and boys my age there ...
... It was a vast difference in the curriculum, but we had the usual grade system. And we did have some vocation. Girls studied sewing and cooking and home economics and things like that and the boys learned a little shop. But it was just a big family, that we recognized each other and until this day anywhere Sam Houston College ex-students run into each other, it's just like running into another member of your family. The school was small and the people had plenty of time to give to the student. And I think some of the finest men and women in life have come from that little school.
Thank you. And upon leaving Samuel Houston, I believe you enrolled in Prairie View. Would you tell us something like what college life was like in Prairie View? Perhaps you'll want to tell us about the age at which you entered and that kind of thing. Whatever you feel like saying.
Well, when I finished the academic work at Sam Houston ... They didn't have college work then. Prairie View didn't have college either, but everybody who wanted to teach school had to go through Prairie View, or﻿12
(cont) you'd be exposed to these normals that they were having in the summer time. And I was too young anyhow, my daddy said, to come out of school and go to work, so I went on to Prairie View. At that time if you were a graduate from Sam Houston College or Wiley, one of those secondary schools, you could go to Prairie View and take an examination which would have been the sophomore class. If you could pass the examination, then you could go into the junior class. You wouldn't have to spend but two years. Other than that you would be there for three or four years. So I took an examination and I spent my junior and senior year of academic work at Prairie View and got my teacher's diploma and then I went on to ... Would you like me to say what I did after that? I taught school three years in my little home town. The first two years I taught in the independent school district of Edna. After that, the county superintendent asked my daddy if I could teach in the county. Papa said if X wanted to. But my papa told me to ask for more money, because the first year I was teaching, I was getting $35 a month which was a whole lot of money to me. But anyway, I did go to the rural area and it's still in our county, but a little railroad terminal community, and they did give me $40, a $5 raise. So I taught those two years there.
This was a town where the Missouri Pacific railroad men tied up trains and changed trains and switched trains and a lot of things. My husband, the man I married , was one of those men, a brakeman.
When I first went down there to school, I had to start the school late in August, because we had to have the school in order to accommodate the farmers. When it was time for the children to go to the fields, they would be available. So I opened school late in August with the understanding that it would close early in April. So this man was on a vacation and he came, in October he came back to his job, and found this little school teacher there. And to begin with, nothing about him impressed me, but anyway I met him in October and in May, the next spring, we married.
And he asked what I was going to do about my school and I told him I didn't know. I hadn't done anything and asked what did he think. And he said, "Well, I don't have any school. I don't need any teachers. But I do have a home and I need a wife." So that ended a teacher's career and I went into different fields of thinking then.
It's getting very romantic now, Mrs. Adair. Since you've mentioned your husband and marriage, and the fact that you gave up your career to be his wife, and I know that later on you became quite a civic and political leader, tell us how long your marriage lasted and how your husband felt about your various activities. And also something about his death, if it's not painful for you.
We were married 25 years when he passed. The first eight years of our married life was at Kingsville, Texas. That was the railroad center. Missouri Pacific's shops were there and all and he was a brakeman. He had seniority enough to get most any job he wanted on the road in the transportation department. He liked freight train serv—﻿13
(cont) -ice better than he did passenger train service. And I think the thing that he disliked about passenger train service was the brakeman on that line ... The white employees were the fireman, the engineer and the conductor. The brakemen were all Negroes. My husband didn't like the idea of having to shine shoes and that's what porters on the train would do. One of those brakemen always had to be the porter. And he didn't like the idea of brushing down the conductor. See, my husband was not a selfish man but he had high ideals and he had a lot of pride and he was a man.
When I went to Kingsville to live, I found that my life was another true evidence of the Bible. When I was a child, I played as a child. When I became a woman, I put down childish things because when I got to Kingsville, I found out that what the people needed were example and leadership. There were no Sunday Schools. The Baptist people had dismissed their pastor. And the Methodist minister was capitalizing on the fact that the money was easy, and whoever got to the men first would get their money. The gambler, the bootlegger, the preacher, the whatnot. So he was making a good stab at it and he was getting to them first and he was just taking advantage, I thought, of people.
I was unhappy, the fact that there were no Sunday Schools. I began getting hold of the children, anybody's children, I could get to me. Then I organized a Sunday School and these children came regardless of their parents' church affiliation. They were my Sunday School children. This was in the early fall of 1918. I married May 8th, 1918. By Christmas time, I could have a Christmas program for the children. When you get children ... Of course, it was more so then than it is now. If you could get children, you had their parents. And that's what I got. I got the children and got the parents with me. And by the time the Baptist people did decide to call a preacher, well, I had all the children. But they called a preacher who had been a child from Victoria, Texas, whom I had known all my life. He had known me all his life, so we knew each other. So that was to my advantage. I had no conflict then about that. But in the other case, I had been active as a little girl and a young woman in the Methodist Church and was pretty well known and had some influence with the higher officials. And the Bishop listened to me when I told him what the conditions were with the Methodist Church at Kingsville, how unhappy I was like that. And he took it upon himself to come down there to see what the conditions were, and when annual conference time came, he sent us another pastor and that pastor had been a schoolmate of mine at Sam Houston College. So I had two young ministers whom I knew, and they knew me, and we together did, I thought, a grand piece of work.
I'd like to call those ministers' names. The Baptist minister was Willie Joshua from Victoria, Texas, and the Methodist minister was Robert Mosby from Kerrville, Texas. Rev. Joshua is dead and Rev. Mosby still lives and is in San Antonio now, I understand, very active in a nice-size church there. He's retired but he's very active. But anyway, the three of us just got the hearing of the people and we got a lot of things done. Common-law marriage just prevailed terribly.﻿14
^RR:	Mrs. Adair, why don't you just continue your discussion about your
efforts in getting the churches organized and going in Kingsville, Texas?
CA:	Yes. Well, after we got two energetic ministers who were interested
in cultural values and religious growth, we moved in pretty well. The Methodist Church was a circuit. The church at Corpus Christi was on the circuit. The minister gave two Sundays at Corpus and two Sundays in Kingsville. But we had enough lay activities going on the days that the minister was not in town. In small towns you don't draw too dense a line between denominations and especially with those two kind of men pastoring the churches. Whenever the Methodist minister was out of town, well, the Baptist man got all the congregation and vice versa. Parents began catching the spirit of furthering their children's education and people began sending their boys and girls away to school, to colleges. I think we got some very good results from those boys and girls whose lives we reached when they were little children.
My husband loved children. We didn't ever have any children. But he loved children and anything I wanted to do about them was all right with him, and he would try to make it possible for me to take them and do things about them. And I was able to inject a lot of things into them. I found in the course of time that I gathered to myself some very valuable friends among women. There were some of the finest women in that little town, I think. Their songs were written and never sung. I don't particularly care about woman lib because the Negro woman has always had to work. I don't think we had to get laws and bills passed for her to get a job, she could always work. I think she, like everybody else if she prepares herself, she gets what she wants and deserves. But we had some women there with very fine ideals who were just sitting around idle because there was not much going on for them to do. But we were able to get some organizations going on, where they found themselves involved in the Eastern Star and things like church affiliated organizations.
DRR:
CA:
Mrs. Adair, I believe it was while you were in Kingsville that you worked with the movement to secure the right of women to vote. Am I right on that? Would you discuss it if I am correct.
Yes, I think it was a case of cast your bread out on the waters and after many days it will return unto you. In Kingsville, the little town was populated according to race. It had what they called Negro Town, White Town, and Mexican Town. And it looked like never the twain shall meet. But anyway, I ran into a problem of a big gambling house that seemed to be one of the first things you got to when you got to the little Negro Town. And community. And it kind of hurt my heart and hurt a lot of women's hearts because it was taking husbands away from home and things like that. And one man was getting rich off the fat of the land. But it looked like we were helpless because the authorities, the sheriff department and like that, was getting rake-offs, and they were not concerned about it. But one day I came along by that building and one of my teenage boys, Sunday School boys, was coming out. And it just put war-fire in me. I just knew that we had﻿15
(cont) to do something, find a way or make one, because this was the last straw. And I had enough influence over the boy to get him to me. I was in a car and he got in the car with me. And he finally told me what went on in there and what they did, and I found out that he wasn't the only teenager that they were using at the tables, to make this money.
Well, then I just began knowing that God was going to find a way. I told the Negro women who were working with me, I said, "We just can't do it alone, and white women who have sons and daughters ought to be interested in this project. Well, X knew one white woman who was the president of a Mothers Club. They didn't have PTAs in those days, they had Mothers Clubs. But we didn't have one in our community. And so this woman's husband was an insurance man and that's how I learned about her, through her husband. So we went to this woman and told her what was what and she just became fired up with it too. She said, "Well, no, you wouldn't have no business trying to do it by yourself, because we can help. And we got the Mothers Clubs." So then she suggested that we organize a Mothers Club in our community and we did. But it was really an interracial Mothers Club, but we didn't recognize it in those days like I would now, or could appreciate it like I could now.
My husband knew that there was a legal side of it. This sheriff became very frightened when he found out that the thing was rolling. Then he subpoenaed a lot of women to come to his office and held court. My husband told me before he went out on the road, he said, "Sweetheart, that isn't legal. That man doesn't have any business holding this court but you all go. Now, don't tell him anything. Everything they ask you, don't you all know, you just play stupid or dumb, just don't have any answers. Don't know anything. When I come back, we'll find a way or make one. We'll do something because I know this is illegal." So sure enough, that's what we did when we went there. We didn't know anything and so then they said, "That's right. I knew they didn't know nothing. Just running their mouths" ... And turned to let us go. I think I called one of these white women and she told me to go to the District Attorney and we went there. And when we told the District Attorney what had happened, and he was just ... He didn't know that gambling house was there. He didn't know what had been going on. But at any rate, he called real court then with authority. And from that point on, it became their responsibility. And it ended up with this sheriff having to go and nail up the building himself and we were on the sidelines rejoicing and praising God.
But after that, the woman's suffrage question came up. Now, we did not know in those days the value of what it meant to us, that we couldn't vote in the primaries. We knew we could vote in presidential elections and were satisfied, but we just figured we were not supposed to and didn't try. But these women told us about this effort being made to pass a bill where women would be able to vote like men. Well, we still didn't know that that didn't mean us, but we helped make contacts and excite public opinion and worked on people about it. And the bill did pass.
And so the first election that they had after the bill passed,﻿16
(cont) the white women were going to vote. And we dressed up and went to vote, and when we got down there, well, we couldn't vote. They gave us all different kinds of excuses why, but we just stayed. We stayed, we asked, "We want to know why we couldn't vote." The answers to the questions were so invalid, we were not satisfied. So finally one woman, a Mrs. Simmons said, "Are you saying that we can't vote because we're Negroes?" And he said, "Yes, Negroes don't vote in primary in Texas." So that just hurt our hearts real bad and we went on. There was nothing we could do about that but just take it as it was.
But the thing that I'm bringing in was we stood there until they said, "You cannot vote because you are a Negro." After I moved to Houston and was with NAACP, and the Supreme Court had the case of the fran-chised primary, that was the thing that Thurgood said to us. The only time I can take a case and do something with it is when they deny you with this word," You can't do it because you're a Negro." Then I remembered back in 1920's that I was with a group of Negro women who made that come out in the conversation. In order to get rid of us, they had to tell us that it was because we were ... Well, it just didn't make us sorry we were Negroes, but it made us realize that we, all the more we had to do something that would break these discriminations .
Mrs. Adair, that's extremely interesting. I believe also it was while you were living in Kingsville that there was an incident that occurred that made you decide to be a Democrat. Would you please tell us about that?
Yes. As near as I can remember all Negroes were Republicans. As I said, we were not active or didn't participate in primaries, but we did participate in national. Because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, well, all Negroes, I think everywhere, nearly, were Republicans. There may have been some Democrats there but I didn't know the difference.
But anyway, when Harding was running for President, the railroad company always sent special trains to bring special people down into that section. Because of my husband's seniority, he was always one of the brakemen that was on the train that would go to bring these home seekers and officials and things like that. And so my husband went on the train that went to bring Mr. Harding down.
Somewhere between Washington, or wherever they were coming from, to Kingsville, my husband observed that people were bringing school children to the train to shake hands with the candidate. And so he called me long distance and told me what was going on. I went over to the school and asked the teachers if they would take their children. And when they didn't have time, or didn't want to or something, I asked them, if the parents consented, could I take some of their children? And I did have 11 or 12 children, and I took them to the train. Well, meeting the trains to get my husband when he'd come off the job, I knew just about how the trains stopped and where the location of cars would be so I knew where to place my children to get the best attention.﻿17
(cont) And when the train stopped, well, my husband was the rear brakeman, and he came out to open the observation gates so the candidate could get out to talk with the people. And so my children were right at the steps. And some white children were there by white teachers or parents, and he - Mr. Harding - reached over my children's heads to shake hands with the white children and never did pay any attention to my children. And I pulled my children out, hurt, disappointed and sorry for the children. But in my own heart, I said, "If that's what Republicans do, I cannot be a Republican. I'll have to change parties. From here on out I'll have to work for Democrat presidents."
Well, that's an extremely interesting observation as to why you became a Democrat. And certainly the Democratic party has been the richer and has benefited much from your effort. About this time, I believe, you moved from Kingsville to Houston, Texas. Will you tell us what occasioned this move and something about your early involvement in civic activities in the city of Houston?
My husband became a diabetic and the doctors said that he needed more rest than he was getting. In freight train service, every eight hours, he was going or coming. But anyway, he was able to get the kind of job he wanted, and that was passenger train work which would give him 62 hours between trips. The Pioneer out of Houston to Brownsville. So out of necessity we moved from Kingsville to Houston. And he would get 62 hours rest between time to go back out on his jobs. I had a lot of friends here, a lot of acquaintances and a lot of people knew me. So it wasn't hard for me to get connected up with people in Houston who were doing things because naturally the first thing we did when we came to town, we got connected with our church. And my church affiliation back in West Texas Conference followed over into the Texas Conference and my husband and I just continued our activities here just like we had always been here.
Then I became concerned with the Federated Club movement. That was not too new in Houston. The first federated club organized here was in 1906, Art; Literary and Charity Club. And I joined that club of women and went to work. The project that they were concerned with right then was a home for delinquent girls, located in the Acreage Home area and that really did kind of stick out with me. I was very much after going out there once or twice, and saw girls - I hadn't ever seen that before, I had seen women prisoners - but I saw girls who were dressed like prisoners and treated like prisoners and that was the project that the club was doing. We would go out there and take them nice little goodies and things like that. That was material things, but I don't know that we did anything to help with the cultural side of it. But anyhow, when the building became condemned or was inadequate,they moved the school out of Harris County. Well, I felt like the club should have protested that. We should have found some way to keep them from moving it. But at that course in time, Bob Casey was the County judge in this town and there was very little you could do with his ideas about things and the commissioners that he was surrounded with. So they moved it. They moved it to Brady, Texas, or they combined it with something else that was already at Brady, Texas.﻿18
(cont) But the Federated Club Women of America's work was the first thing I started out with other than my church when I first got here.
So then after I was here a year or so, the NAACP was organized on a voluntary basis. I was the first, well, I was not the first recording secretary, I was assistant to the first one, but the man who was elected recording secretary was not here long after that because he went to New York with the cooperative grocery business. And that meant I was moved up to secretary. So I was the first volunteer secretary of the branch here. Well, we had some pretty strong cases, cases like the DiMarco-Bob White case. Most of the cases were rape cases where white people used to become dissatisfied and disgruntled about a thing. The best way they could do, some white woman would holler that she'd been raped by a Negro or ventured to rape, or something like that, and of course that meant a burned or lynched Negro. And so this happened down at Conroe. But we were able to get a lawyer - this was one of NAACP's first projects - and a lawyer that won that case in our favor. And the day of the trial when he was declared innocent and turned loose, they shot him right in the jail house, I mean right in the courthouse down in Conroe, that's in Montgomery County.
Well, those things were so exciting to me, I did not know that people could be treated like people in Houston were being treated. Not only in cases like that, but in jail, prisoners generally, why, they would beat up people and anything they wanted to do and kill people. And NAACP then became the sole interest of mine. That was the organization it looked like that I was cut out to be a part of. It became next to my church. I was not employed so when my husband died in '43, I just did volunteer work like that all the time. Then after he'd been gone two years, I not only saw the need of a job, but I felt that it was the thing that would help me, so I became involved with a lot of things.
And the first employment I had was to sell the Seventh War Bonds. It was while I was selling the Seventh War Bond that the county extension agent asked if I wanted a job. I said, "I need one." He said, "Well, when you get through with the bond, come to the office. I think I have something for you to do. My secretary is going." I knew I wasn't equal to that, but I knew if anybody else had ever done it, I could learn how to do it. And I applied myself to it. So for eight or nine months, maybe ten months, I was the secretary to the Home Demonstration and County Agricultural Agents.
By that time, NAACP had moved up where we were able to open an office and employ an executive administrator. And we did employ a woman named Mrs. Lula White as Executive Secretary of the NAACP. The building where we put our office was the same building in which this county extension agent was, and so she and I began kind of getting acquainted with first one thing and then the other. When the Board said that she could have help and they would pay an administrative assistant, she asked me if I'd take it and I was just jubilant about it. So then for three years I was administrative assistant to the Houston branch.﻿19
Very good. You've mentioned your initial services with the NAACP, I seem to remember that a case was held in Tyler, Texas, which is very near my home, and I believe you were one of the key witnesses. Would you discuss that? It seems to me that you stayed on the stand for several hours at one time.
Yes. After Mrs. White's time was up at NAACP ... she resigned in '49, After serving three years as administrative assistant, things happened with the branch that kind of made it lose its influence and its strength and money and members. There was not enough money for both of us, so I was the person who had to come out and she stayed as the administrator. But in '49, things had gotten so low on the ebb that she had to come out too. So that left us without an NAACP, and the Board members came and asked me if I would take it. I knew they had no money to pay me with and I knew that the conditions of the branch were very bad. It had been infiltrated, which was terrible for us, and our names were on the Un-American Activities list. But my attitude about those things, when I was in the office as administrator, made the Board know that I would not be influenced by it and that I would help them fight it out.
So I went back into the office in February, 1950. She resigned in October, '49. And so I went back into the office and began serving as administrator. The men on the board - the president, Dr. Smith, Sid Hilli-ard, Rev. Simpson, and I could give a lot of names of people - said, "If you will take the job, we know there's no money to pay you with, but we will see that your bills are paid and that your living conditions continue normally until we can get it back on a paying basis. We just believe you can do it." Well, that was a challenge and I met it. And I did.
I gave 12 years of sacrificial service in there because there never was enough money to pay me. But I did get whatever would be left over after bills were paid; I got it. I was happy and that was the main thing that counted. I was doing what I wanted to do and liked to do and the people were cooperative. I had no problem whatever getting members. I had some of the richest white people, some of the finest industrial Negroes were members of NAACP. And people who were afraid, they thought, of it, well, I was able to get them.
But at any rate, I was on the job when we entered the school segregation cases. Our office was one of the offices where they sent an auditor and, oh, everybody, I call them, really call them termites because that's what they did to us. They just went through our office like storm, they tore our drawers. All our files, they emptied them. They rented photostatic copying machines and set them up in our office. They took photostatic copies of every scrap of paper, everything they wanted. They just left our offices like the Wreck of the Hesperus. If I knew anything at all, I knew how to file and our office was in perfect order. But they, at any rate, after all of that, then they still padlocked our office and put us out of business.
Well, the case was set in Texas. We were at the stage of higher education then where boys and girls were not being allowed to enter col-﻿20
(cont) leges of their choice. They were going to have to be sent out of the state. The state would give what they called state aid. They would pay boys and girls to go out of the state to other states and go to school with white boys and girls but they couldn't go tp schools in Texas, taxpayer-supported schools. So, we had some plaintiffs and what they were trying to make me deliver was my membership roll. Well, in this town, this county, maybe I should say, if a man worked at any of the industries, steel or oil, any of those places., and it became known that he was a NAACP card-carrying member, he would be fired. On the other hand, if a white person was identified as a member or a supporter, well, they would be disfranchised, and be hurt politically and socially and in every other way.
So I didn't have any business with the membership roll and they couldn't understand why I didn't have one. But I didn't have one. And I'd say, "I don't need a membership roll." I would show them the envelope that we got membership money in. I said, "This envelope has the name and addresses and amounts of money for membership, and they turn it in to me. I don't do anything but take the money out of them. I don't need it because the money goes to the national, and they are the ones that have to have the names of these people who pay." So they said, "Where is that?" Well I said, "I don't have that. I send that to the NAACP in New York, that's what they have."
I had had communication with the executive offices in New York. I knew what to do and what to say and how to do it. Anyway, we didn't have a membership roll available but they never did believe me. When they had the trial at Tyler, the Attorney General said that it was barratry that we sol icited court cases to turn over to Thurgood Marshall and the legal department and that's what they had to prove. One of the main things was that they were after membership rolls anywhere they could get them.
So they subpoenaed me to come to court and I went to Tyler. I don't remember the ... Trial seems to have lasted about six weeks or maybe two months, I don't know. Anyway, I was subpoenaed and I was put on the stand to question and test out for five hours. Two hours before lunch and three hours afterwards, all with one thing, showing me this, "Did you do this? How did you do it? Why did you do it?" And everything leading up to this membership roll which I still didn't have. Really I thought that when you think of what Texas depends on and why we elect officials, you can think of people who had time to sit around and ask questions and do some of the things which just turned out to be a soap box opera. Our young people that they had subpoenaed just made fools out of Texas officials. You know, the way they would answer questions and what they would say. And in my own case and they asked me, "Do you belong to anything else besides NAACP?" And I did. And I started out. They asked me the name of them and I started out naming them, and started with the Methodist Church and the Eastern Star and it went on through. And I said, "And I belong to the Harris County Democrats," and they said, "Well, what is that?" And I looked at them with a lot of curiosity in my expression and I said, "Are you asking me what the Harris County Democrat is?" And I said, "That is a political﻿21
CA:	(cont) organization." And I tried to put a whang in my voice to let
them know that I think you are foolish. And so then they wanted to know what the Harris County Democrat does. And I said, "Are you asking me what the Harris County Democrat does or are you asking me what the NAACP does?" "What the Harris County Democrat does." And I said, "Well, I didn't know they were on trial today."
My lawyers, Attorney Tate and Attorney Durham, they let them ask all these questions. They didn't object to any of them because they felt like, that I could answer them. And they were well satisfied with my answers , but when I said that I did not think that the Harris County Democrat was on trial, then Mr. Durham or Mr. Marshall or somebody said, "We object. We want to give her a chance to answer the questions but we know, your Honor, that they had no right to ask her the question." But anyway, they showed themselves up a lot and we won the case. After ten months, we were able to open our office and go back, which meant I went back over the whole restoration period of restoring the organization, getting members and getting money and was pretty well whipped out.
It affected my health. I think maybe mentally, because I began to be ... so I couldn't count money. But anyway, that was the termination of my administration.
DRR:	Thank you very much, Mrs. Adair. This is getting to be more interest-
ing as we go along. I seem to remember from reading in years back in the news media, about some of your activities here in Houston that had to do with the destruction of discriminatory practices. I remember something about Hobby Airport. Will you tell us about that? I think you had something to do with that.
CA. *
Mrs. Robinson, I think segregation of races was the cruelest thing that could ever happen to people, not only Negroes, but to people, period. I think everybody suffered from segregation. I think Houston was a little advanced and rather blessed.
DRR:
CA:
We ended that last tape when you mentioned that you felt Houston was somewhat more blessed than other communities in the matter of race relations. Will you continue and lead up to the Hobby Airport situation?
As I said, we had worked together on other things, so when these serious things came about, we were able to understand each other and work together. The Harris County Democrats was organized about the same time that the Harris County Council was organized. And the two were organized with the same purpose in mind. It was to help Negroes know the value of their vote, and that they were not supposed to cast their votes because somebody was going to pay them or give them a drink or anything. They were supposed to do it because they knew they were putting the right person in the right place in office.
So, by the time we came up to the real nitty-gritty projects, we had a﻿22
(cont) pretty good understanding. One of the first things that I encountered when I went into the office as administrator, was some communication that was being passed between the city authorities and the Civil Aeronautics Commission. They were wanting to build a new airport. Now, the Hobby Airport was out there, but segregation was so raw and so painful until it's almost hard to believe what was going on. Negroes could not sit in the waiting room open. They had four benches pulled together which made a little square. And if you were waiting to change planes or waiting for a plane, you'd have to sit in the confines of those seats. You couldn't get a cold drink, couldn't go buy a cold soda water or anything at the counters or concessions. If you wanted food, you had to go to the kitchen door and they would hand you out a sandwich or whatever it is you wanted to buy.
Well, many people came through the airport and encountered that kind of experience. Madame Bethune was one of them. You know Madame Bethune was not going inside the confines of four benches to sit. So she stood on the edge of it and rested her grip on the arm of the bench while she got a sky cap or somebody to call the NAACP office. They didn't call me. They were calling the NAACP, but when they told what the condition was, I would get a photographer and go out there to take a picture of these things. And that*s what we turned over to our legal department. And the person himself would sign statements that this did happen. That thing did happen in the Air Force and the Army where squad companies, young men and young women of the two races, would have to change planes in Houston and they would encounter that kind of treatment.
Well, usually the white members of the company would not participate in what they were offered, because the Negro members were not allowed. But they, too, would call NAACP, and out would come a photographer and we would take those pictures. So then finally a foreigner from, I just can't remember, from Ethiopia or something, but anyhow, it was a dark-skinned race, and he had to encounter that experience. Well, his statement and the things that he did had more bearing because it was very dangerous, it was dealing with international relations. And it brought a lot of problems. Anyway, the city was looking for help for federal aid to build a new airport.
Oh yes, let me tell you one -more, other thing about this airport. The restroom was about a block and a half down a dark alleyway from the waiting room. And when you got down there it would say, "For Colored," which meant that Negro men and Negro women used the same restroom. You'd have to stand outside and wait for one or the other to go out. Signs were all over, "For Colored" and "For White." But anyway, the Aeronautics Commission sent down some representatives. They entertained them, carried them on boat rides at the ship channel and everything, and ended up going to give them a big feast in the dining room at the City Hall and oh, had a hallelujah time. They thought ... I guess they were looking for some big fat checks or something. But anyway, when they got through and these representatives said it was time to get down to business, and pulled out communications from their briefs and laid them out on the table and said, " You are wanting federal funds, you﻿23
(cont) want to build an airport," and like that and got their commitment about things and said, "Now, these are some communications that have come to us. They're copies of letters between you and the Houston branch, NAACP, or between us and the Houston branch, and so we'll have to know something about it because if what's in these letters is true, we can't put federal funds in it."
They got very angry. The man who finally became the mayor of Houston, Louie Welsh, was a member of the Council then. He was the man that, the newspapers said, got up and said, "We don't need their money. We'll build an airport. We'll float a bond and build an airport like we want it." And that's what they did. They did build the airport and they built it on Negro ... Because Negroes voted just like they did to help them get it. We didn't know any better.
But before time for the airport to become completed and to open, the City of Houston had a city election and we changed mayors. A man named Roy Hofheinz, who is the father of the present mayor, became our new mayor. From time he entered in, got himself settled in his office, I began calling his attention to the communications which I thought might be in the files pertaining to that airport. And I told him, "If you don't have them, I have copies." But anyway, they were there. And he sent his administrative assistant out to the airport to look around to see what was going on out there and he came back with the reports. Said, "Yes, the signs are on the new walls and the new concession, everything just like the old one."
So then we were supposed to open the airport, as near as I can remember, in the spring. But we were late summer getting it opened, because the new mayor authorized that they not only take the signs down but to take the wall down with the signs on them. And then the airport did open. It opened to the public. Everybody went in and have enjoyed the airport because we got a mayor who knew his job and played his job well on behalf of the people.
Since I'm talking about that, I'd like to also say that up till that time, we couldn't get a book from the library. We were not allowed in the libraries. They had a branch building over in the fourth ward, just behind the old high school and that was the Carnegie Library. It was a brick building. The only books we could get would be the books that were over there. No matter whose student it was, or what club or what organization, you didn't know what was in a book unless it was in that Carnegie Library. And material was very short.
So this new mayor called the NAACP office early one morning and said, "Mrs. Adair, this is not healthy news for publication so I would like for you ... the first thing you do, I would like for you to notify your high school principals and your reading public to go to the library and get their library cards." He said, "Mrs. Adair, the city libraries are open to everybody." So that went on.
Then the Supreme Court's decision about travel and transportation came. I think Houston had less trouble with solving its problem in change over﻿25
(cont) self. He told him that he didn't want the sun to go down without the culprits apprehended. And I'm here as a living witness that before sundown, three men were in jail. And they stayed in jail until their trial, and went from the trial to the penitentiary. They may still be there if they're not dead, I don't know. But those are the types of things that have been handled and happened in Houston.
Now, there are some things that ... my experience of things that sound insignificant now, but to us they were very ugly. For instance, a newspaper that carried the listings of war casualties and carried listings of vital statistics information, I don't care whose son, I don't care what his rank was in the Army, I don't care who the parents were, the listings of the war casualties would be Mary, Jane, John Somebody, son of Mary, son of ... like that. It was never the courtesy of the parents being Mr. or Mrs. or Dr. Somebody, it was just plain old that. Same thing about marriage licenses. The listing of marriage licenses of Negroes, would all be at the bottom and this would be Hattie and John getting married. They are the sons and daughters of Mary and John and the last name, whatever.
I thought that was disrespectful, not only to us, but I thought it was disrespectful to Houston. And I thought the Houston news media was doing things that were a discredit to themselves. And my committee on public relations started a fight on those kind of things. And we did. Not only in Houston,but it became a custom in Texas, that these things would be listed according to the Mr. and Mrs. or Dr. and whatever it was, the parents' names in all of these kinds of things.
Very good, Mrs. Adair. I'd like to know one thing, I guess as a matter of personal interest. I'd like to know if the airport ever received any government funding. And you might continue and tell us about segregation at the swimming pool at the VA Hospital. I think you were also instrumental in that.
Oh yes, that's why we could extend the time on the opening. Because we could have a better and a bigger airport because we could get federal funds then after that segregation was blotted out. It was built according to regulation.
Yes, we had ugly uncomfortable problems with the Veterans Administration Hospital because ... It's bad enough for well people to have to suffer discrimination, but when sick people have to suffer, it's miserable. And our office got appeals from the patients out there. Their therapy would call for swimming pool activities and the Negro patients were not allowed in the swimming pools. Negro men would have to go for days and days without shaving, until some of their family would go out and shave them, because they didn't allow them in the barber shop.
They put out a proclamation asking for volunteer help, women, to roll bandages and to deliver literature for reading, and little courtesies and things for the patient. And I notified a group of women who would go and they went. When they got out there, they told them they didn't need any help, that kind of help, at all. They didn't need that at all. Well, I didn't take that for an answer. We weren't trying to force﻿26
CA:	(cont) ourselves on the deal, but I knew that if any patients needed,
Negroes did, and if anybody deserved courtesy from anybody, our patients needed it from us. So we stirred up a little agitation about that.
Then the swimming pool thing became quite an issue because the health education laws of Texas went into it. We had several things that happened with that VA Hospital that finally I think the man lost his job.
It seems that was no end to the different things that the NAACP was accomplishing during your working with it. I wonder if you had anything to do with the Heman Sweatt case, that resulted in the admission of blacks to the University of Texas. I guess I have a personal interest in this because I was the first black person from my county to enroll at the University of Texas.
P A
That's really something good to hear. Every time I become acquainted with somebody who has accomplished something through these kinds of efforts, I just swell up with selfish pride, looked like I touched that.
But yes, the Sweatt case started under the administration of Mrs. White but it did not culminate until I went in as the administrator. So I had a lot to do in helping with it both as an assistant administrator and then as the Executive Secretary, too.
We took a lot of pride in that because see, Houston had furnished the plaintiff for the primary case. Dr. Lonnie Smith had served that. And was a success. Then when the parents of men like Sweatt and students themselves needed somebody and came ... and that is what you have to do. You don't get NAACP's assistance just by them looking up and coming and bringing it to you. You have to go and ask them to help you with a case that you have. And assure them of your cooperation and let the legal department of the NAACP, beginning with the local branch, the state branch, the regional and the national ... They study it out to make the decision whether there are NAACP merits in the case or not. There is never a local branch case; it is always the NAACP case. Because when Thurgood Marshall, who is now a Supreme Court judge, was our legal advisor in NAACP, he always said, "Never go to interview or to negotiate alone. Always have a witness and if possible always get the decision in black and white." That protected the NAACP from the accusation of barratry.
When the national would decide that we can take the case, then the locals can come in on it and feel like they' re the sponsors. So that's the way we felt about the Lonnie Smith case, primary, and the Heman Sweatt case in education. Because it was our product and we did feel that way. However people from all over the world furnished the money for those cases. Houston can only take credit for providing the plaintiffs, but they cannot take the credit for financing it.
DRr.
I know you must take a great deal of pride in looking back at some of the things that have been accomplished by your efforts and by your ability to involve other people in cooperative projects, but I also know that there were some things, some experiences that you had, that were more or less personal. I'm thinking now about an experience that﻿27
(cont) you bad with respect to trying on a girdle and I also believe something about trying on hats in the downtown stores. Relate that to us, please.
Mrs. Robinson, none of these things can we say Christia Adair did. I have to always say, "we." I'm a person that anything I'm going to do, I just got to have a lot of people doing it with me. So it wasn't hard for me to do NAACP programs because I had to have other people with me. But when you're in an NAACP office, as an administrator, people bring you every kind of problem.
And so the women began telling me that they couldn't try on hats - I knew it because I couldn't - they couldn't try on girdles; they couldn't do this. But I wouldn't ever be satisfied, I'd go try it out myself to see if this is really fact. Always carry somebody along to hear them say, "No, you cannot." And so there were times that I would go in, pick out a hat and the sales lady would put it on her head and say, "I think it's pretty; don't you like that?" I'd say, "Well, I like it on you but I don't know if I'd like it on me or not. I don't think the same hat that would become you would become me." And so they would always have their foot on the chair so you couldn't sit down in front of the mirror to try on a hat. You had to pick it up. Of course, I never bought anything that I couldn't try on. I haven't been a bully in my lifetime, but I never compromised. My daddy didn't compromise for those things, I'll tell you, when we get through this, about an experience my daddy had, about his hauling. It scared us all to death. We thought he was going to lose out.
But anyway, I just didn't buy anything. I'd do without it first. But when some prominent women came and told me that they would have to go into an alteration raom to fit a girdle if they wanted to buy it at a popular store in tcxwn, Sakowitz store was the store then. And I went. I never did particularly need a girdle, especially back there because I was pretty thin, skinny, didn't have time nor money to eat with. But anyway, I went to bray a girdle. And I picked out a girdle. Then I went to have the girdle fitted. And when they headed me toward the alteration room, I said, "I don't want anything done to it, I just want to try it on." They said, "Well, you go on in." I said, "Well, I don't want to tiny It on in the alteration room. I want to try it on in the fitting room." And they tried to shove me some place. I said, Look, I tell you. Let roe see the manager of this department." And so they had no alternative but to produce the manager, and the manager didn't want anybody to know that he was supporting that kind of attitude, so he put the woman on the spot and just passed the buck to her and said to her, "Show the customer to the fitting room."
So she showed me to the fitting room and was about to leave, so I said, "But you have to stay with me because I don't know how to fit a ... I don't know how it's supposed to fit." And so she had to stand there and touch my Negro hide. And she sort of fumbled with me, my body, and I know she felt like "hex little hands were being contaminated, but that's what had to happen. And I sat and I laid and I did everything, moved it and the girdle did not fit and it was not what I wanted. Of﻿28
(cont) course she had to go back and bring in one or two more to be sure I was getting the right fit. And then when I got all fitted and I had gone as far as I thought it was necessary to get justice out of the thing, and went to the counter, the girdle was $29. And I didn't need any kind of girdle, but I couldn't fail. I had to pay for it because that would be carrying it too far, but that was the kind of experience you had to suffer for the cause if you wanted to master the situation. And I did.
With your many years of service with the NAACP and your many efforts at breaking down segregation, I'm wondering if you ever were threatened or were you ever cursed in any way; would you share experiences of that sort with us?
Yes, Mrs. Robinson, I think everybody who has ever gotten out in front and taken a stand for right and for justice, I think you would not only be threatened but I think you'd be harmed sometimes. And there were times during the experiences, not even during the NAACP days but even
in later years, when things xvould bubble up and controversial questions come about, right off the reel, they'd say, "Christia Adair was behind this." And I would be threatened and I ...
Oh, several times, the office of NAACP was in the Pilgrim Building, and many times they'd have to unload the building because the law says if a bomb is reported, or something like that, you've got to empty the building and they did it so many times, till I almost lost office space. The owner didn't want us as tenants any more because they said we were worrisome. But I could always let the owner of the building, who was a Negro, remember that it was as much damage to him as it was to us to be disfranchised.
But there have been nights that I have been afraid to come home. I never did let anybody know I was afraid, but plenty of times I have gone home with other people from a meeting where ... I had done a lot of straight talk in a meeting or maybe some of the other officers of the NAACP or members, the chairman, would make some strong talk and I'd be afraid to come home because I lived alone and so somebody would take me home.
I can truthfully say that the time that I have worked and whatever I have done, I've never been alone with it. I've always had a lot of people who appreciated my efforts. They might not have much initiative about it, but if ever I started it, I would always have a following and I thank God for that.
And Mrs. Robinson, I thank God that I'm 83 years old, because I am seeing the results and benefits of a lot of things that I was afraid to do, and yet I went on to do it. And with God's protection and my hand always in His hand, I never have had any physical injury.
Thank you, Mrs. Adair. You've made some reference to the Harris County Democrats. And I also know that you've made some reference in personal conversation to the first integrated political meeting that was﻿29
(cont) held here in Houston, Texas. And I think there's some relationship between the two. Would you talk about it for a moment, please?
Yes, I don't know whether I have said this or not, but when we first won the franchise, the right to vote in the primary, these same people that tried to keep us from getting the franchise would get hold to the gullible Negro and the ignorant Negro, the illiterate Negro, anybody that was weak enough to listen or afraid of something, and give them a bottle of wine or beer or some money. Some of them have gotten big money out of it. In order to carry the crowd and get out the vote for their choice of candidate. Well, that was hurting too. It was very unfair, and hurting the Negro race to know that we were that weak and that gullible. And at the same time it was hurting the Democrat party, because these people who were doing these things were not good Democrats, but they were the conservatives, rank conservative Democrats and the Republicans.
A Negro man named M. L. Ward, he was just a perfectly ordinary man, who owned a filling station, but he was president of a civic club. And what was going on about the vote was worrying him and he kept worrying about it until finally he was able to get enough organizations like civic clubs, and anybody who was organized, into groups. He'd get them together, so we could start a plan by which we might be able to persuade our people not to be that weak to be bought. And it got on its foot right off the reel. Looked like it was very attractive. At the same time, a woman named Frankie Randolph and another couple, Attorney J. Edwin Smith and his wife, Virginia, and a few others, saw what was happening and they too decided that something ought to be done, organization-wise, that would stop it.
So, Mrs. Randolph came to the NAACP office to talk with me about it and to say how disturbed they were, and that they felt our organization would be the answer. So she said, "Do you think you could get other Negroes who would be concerned about it?" And I said, "I'm sure I could." So she said, "Well, would you get them together and let's see if we can have a meeting." Now, at that time, Negroes and white people couldn't meet in public places together but the Chronicle, or one of the oil companies, let us use their office up town to hold these little meetings like we had to have together.
I was able to get about seven or eight other Negroes and we would have these meetings at night. And we would discuss how we would do it, and with whom we could do it, and finally we thought we had it just about solid enough that we could sell the idea. And everybody left the meeting with the promise, the commitment, that they would get some other people. We didn't know ... we thought perhaps we were going to have to get in a church. We didn't know how we were going to do it. But a man who had charge of the communication workers' union hall said that his group said that we could have the meeting there, under the protection of that union. And so that's what we did.
We scheduled a meeting and we invited a lot of people. That was the very first interracial meeting. Now, I tell you this, there had been﻿30
(cont) a group of people at some other time called the Race Relation Committee, some white people and some Negroes. About once every year, they would have a worship service, where a lot of Negroes would go to a white church with them and they would have singing and maybe a Negro choir would sing, something like that. But there was nothing controversial about it, so nobody bothered them.
But this meeting was the very first integrated meeting of people of ... It was just like a League of Nations, because we went out and got the Mexicans and everybody else to come to the meeting. And then everybody who was a part of the initial group that was working on it, everybody had a chance to talk so the people that you influenced would reach, you could say it. So that's the way we did and that night we decided and organized the Harris County Democrats. The chairman was a white man, the vice-chairman was a Negro woman, the secretary was a Negro woman, the assistant secretary was white and on like that. It was just so mixed up so that they'd know nobody was left out.
Up to that time, 1 think there was one man who was a precinct judge, election judge. But after we got the Harris County Democrats organized, and we began fighting with the local Democrat party until we got many, many Democrat precinct judges over the county. And through this organization, we learned each other; we learned each other's voters; we won elections; we won issues; we just did everything. And I always say that Harris County Democrats did more for race relations, in promoting it in this county, than anything, including NAACP. We did a lot of things. We forced a lot of things in and got it done through legal tactics. But the Harris County Democrats really did a lot and brought a lot of people together that never would have understood each other had it not been for them.
The Harris County Council of Organizations became one of the legs of the Harris County Democrats. Whatever the Harris County Democrats decided to do, this organization strengthened it with contact and participation.
Very good. I believe that according to the records, you were one of the first black election judges. Am I correct?
Yes. I was. I lived in one precinct, 24, and the precinct judge was a contemptible white woman and she made it so uncomfortable and disagreeable to vote. There was nobody at the polls but her and some of her girls. And white girls could bring down such terrible things on Negro men, until a lot of people just stopped voting. And a lot of white people in the precinct stopped voting because they didn't like the practices there anyway.
So the precinct was dwindling down and we ran a Negro man against her, the father of the present Councilman Judson Robinson, Jr. But the same year that we were running him for election as a precinct judge, we were holding the election at the fire station, and the firemen were trying to get a raise. And this woman was against the firemen getting a raise so she threw all of the votes that were cast for Judson Robinson and all the votes that were cast for the firemen's raise, in the ash can.﻿31
(cont) When the firemen found theirs, they found ours. Well, we formed ourselves into investigation squads. We would take one notary and two other people and we would ring doorbells with affidavits. "Did you vote for Martha Sperling or Judson Robinson?" "I voted for such and such." And so we got enough of these and carried them to the Supreme Court of Texas, but they wouldn't open the box, said it was party affairs and it wasn't a legal matter. So they didn't do anything about it.
So we lost that election. Judson didn't win. Well, we were not too satisfied with the initiative he had put into it, but at any rate, we still decided we were going to do it another year. And they were looking for somebody. I said, "Well, I don't have time to be a precinct judge. The NAACP is taking all my time, but to be sure we'll win, I'll put my name on the ballot." And so that's what we did and at the close of that election, she had 84 votes and I had 800 and something.
So then the Commiss ioner's Court was very unhappy about that because, when I began presiding, I reached down and mixed my precinct because my precinct, according to population, was mixed. So I had some white judges and some Negro judges and they just couldn't take that. A Negro woman over some white people. So they gerrymandered the precinct before another time rolled around and gerrymandered me out of my precinct. But they took one of my clerks and made him a precinct judge of this new precinct that they created and he did the same thing I did. He got a mixed precinct, workers over there. So they didn't accomplish anything by that. They moved me out of my precinct, from 24 to 25. Well, the man who was the precinct judge did not want to be precinct judge. He was simply that because we had asked him. When he found that I was there, he said, "Mrs. Adair, please be the precinct judge. I'll always help you and stand by but I just don't want to be. I won't even put my name on the ballot. Just put your name on the ballot." I think in our conversation you told me that you knew Sylvia Harrison, I mean Sylvia Farnsworth Harrison. Well, this is her husband I'm talking about now. So Edwin didn't put his name on the ballot and I did. I was elected as precinct judge of 25, and I was that 20 years.
Thank you. I believe as late as 1966, you and Judson Robinson had some controversy at or about the state convention. Would you comment on that, please?
You mean the Democratic convention? Yes. This was Judson Jr., not his daddy. But this was Judson Jr. We were nominated from our senatorial districts as representatives to the state convention from Harris County. We were both from different senatorial districts. But anyway, at the state convention, they would not seat the Harris County Democrats but they went in a caucus and decided that Judson Robinson and I would be admitted into the state convention and be seated. And they came out, they thought with flying colors, to inform us that that had happened. Judson had had such little experience, he didn't try to answer. I said, "Well, is the Harris County Democrat delegation going to be seated?" And they said, "No, just you and Judson." I said, "Well, no. We won't either." I said, "No, I'm here as a representative﻿(cont) from the Harris County Democrats. They're the ones that nominated me and I won't be seated unless the whole organization can be seated, all the delegates." They said that couldn't be. Judson said, "Well, that goes for me too. I won't either."
So we wouldn't accept the reception and we didn't go in, which meant that the Harris County Democrats were left out too. Even after I returned to Houston and all day the next day at the office, Mr. Blan-ton, who was then the county chairman of the Democratic party, and some of the state officials and all, kept calling long distance and sending telegrams. They thought it would be such an honor for me to accept and things like that. And so I had to excuse myself of the language of the streets, and I said to them that "I've been a lot of things in my life, but I'll never be a good nigger."
I'm sure that if it's spunk or courage or whatever it is, I think I got that trait from my daddy also. I remember that at one time somebody on the school board, or somebody in some official capacity, in Ed na wanted my daddy to use ais influence on Negroes to help Lhem to make a decision that he knew would not be for the good of all the people. And they came to his house and they hollered, "Help," at the gate and Papa went to see what they wanted. And when they laid it out to him and he said, "No, I can't do that because I don't believe in it, myself. I wouldn't tell my friends anything I don't believe." So then they said, "Well, Handy, now if you can't follow through with what we want and you can't work with us and follow our decisions, it looks like we're going to have to get somebody else to do our work," meaning their hauling.
My daddy was a man that never went outdoors without his hat on. He wore a black stetson hat. And he reached and took that hat off his head and slammed it down on the ground and said, "You take your damn job and your hauling, whatever you have, and go to hell with it, because before I would sell my soul and my principle, and influence people of my race wrong, I don't care what you do with your job." And so my mother was very afraid. Mama said, "Papa, suppose if ..." He said, "Mama, they don't have a horse, they don't have a mule. They don't have anything to haul anything on. By the time they would get themselves organized to haul something, all their dry goods and groceries and everything else would be in the box car spoiling and dry-rotting."
So I felt just like that about this case. If I conceded to go into that place, it would mean that I was leaving not only Negroes all out, but white people who believed like I believed.
You have been identified with so many organizations, I'm afraid, really, we're not going to be able to cover them all. But would you tell us something about the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs? I notice you've been very active in that.
Yes, this is an organization that was organized right after slavery, in the 18th century, maybe in the early 19th. But at any rate, women like Mary Church Terrell and Phillis Wheatley and Margaret Turbman and﻿33
(cont) Josephine Carman and all those women like that, out of slavery ... The white woman looked down with disdain on the Negro woman because she had mulatto colored young ones and they said she was immoral. Well, why didn't she have mulatto and mixed colored children, when the slave master could go from cottage to cottage, cabin to cabin and make the Negro women yield her bodies to him and put his babies anywhere he wanted. Then on the other hand, slavery was over and he couldn't force Negro women to do those things, but there was no money. Their husbands couldn't make money, there was none for them to make, very little living sources. And he could jingle his pockets and she would sell her body for the sake of a dollar.
Well, these women decided that they would try to start out with an effort that would make the white woman out a liar first about them being immoral because of the color of their children. But at the same time, they wanted to educate our women to know that it would be better not to have a lot of things than it would be to lay down your principle and your chastity and your virtue and all that. So the organization started on a small )le, this little group and that little group, until finally it got so contagious and went through so many states and vicinities until they found themselves with a coalition of people, a cross section of women that they could get together who believed the same way and were willing to sacrifice and work.
That was the beginning of the National Association of Colored Women's CLubs. They operate today in every state in the union, including Hawaii and Alaska. Right here in this area, we have what we call the ... Well, maybe I should say this, that we operate on five levels: the local club, the district, the state, the regional and the national. Our headquarters are in Washington, D.C., and we own our own building and property on 16th Street, N.W.
In this area, we have the Olivia Washington District. Olivia Washington was also one of the founders. Our district comprises three counties, Fort Bend County, Harris County and Galveston County. And all over Texas we have districts. I think there are nine districts that make up Texas. Then we have the Texas Association of Women's Clubs.
We have a regional association made up of Northeast, Southeast, West-east, there are four regionals. We meet biannually on national and regional levels. The state and districts meet annually. In Texas, we own a campsite, 13 miles this side of Fort Worth. It's right on the border line of Johnson and an adjoining county. The closest little town to it is Alvarado. But we own it free from expense. That's to say, we own the property and it's 125 acres. We have a lake on there; we have cottages and an activities building. And we are in the process now of getting it ready to open for camp season for people, whoever wants to use our camp.
This organization is a group that has never had any barriers. Our motto is "Lifting as we climb." Which means that we have not tried to major on the woman who has already reached her zenith, who has had all kinds of opportunities and advantages, but the woman who needs us,﻿34
(cont) the woman who hasn't had advantages, the woman who is down and needs to be lifted. We need to climb. We also know that in order to climb, we have to have strength and we have to have enough influence if we want her to follow us. So we major our interest on the woman that perhaps is sometimes not recognized by her church. But we feel like if it takes recognition to give her a push and a start in life, we give it.
We also have girls' clubs. We started with nine-yeai^old girls and they work categorically until they are old enough to become adult girls and junior women. And then to the older adult women's club. At the very present time, we have a splendid bunch of young and middle-aged women at the official helm of our state organization and we're doing marvelous work that we've never done before. But all over the world, the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs reaches out and you become a part.
When I was really active in political activities, I could sit down and send a letter out to women all over the state and say this is the decision that the women of Harris County Democrats and the Council of Organizations people have made and we solicit your support for this candidate or this issue. And we got it. And we still have long and big support out of women in all walks of life doing everything and participating in everything that's worthwhile from church down to the lowest level of club work.
Mrs. Adair, it seems that there's just no end to your interest and no end of the energy that you have to expend for various causes. In looking at the plaques on your wall, of which there are very many, I notice that you are a life member of the Woman's Society of Christian Service for the Methodist Church. You are connected with the Texas Federation of Church Women and that you are the first black woman to hold membership on the Central Board of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Will you comment on that, please?
Yes, Mrs. Robinson. I think if you use yourself and put yourself to be used, you learn how to do a lot of things by doing it. It's good to get observation and reading and things, but it feels mighty good to be able to say, "I did this," or "This is because I touched it and I have physical reasons for being involved, and I know it can happen and happened because I helped it happen." Well, that's the way it was with the Methodist Church. I grew up doing and serving and being available and when the Methodist Church South and the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Protestant Methodist had unification in 1939, well, most of the organizations within the churches had to change their name so it would involve all of these groups.
In the Methodist Episcopal Church was a Woman's Home Missionary Society, the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, and a Ladies Aid Society. Well, I was the district president of the Houston District Ladies Aid Society. In the meantime, when we got to the point where we were organizing the women's division of Christian Service, which would involve all of the women's organizations of the three branches, we found that the women﻿35
(cont) who had been active in Ladies Aid Society, and not active in foreign and home missionary work, were kind of left out of the picture because there was no specific job for them in the woman's division.
Well, those of us who had worked in the Ladies Aid Society, were feeling ourselves left out, so we had to make some protest and we began proving ourselves with value. The Ladies Aid Society of the Houston District could point out and had concrete evidence of the services rendered by the Ladies Aid Society, to the point that it was our suggestion and our strength that helped the women's division to say, "Well, we need another department that will serve the same purpose as the Ladies Aid Society did and yet not operate like the Ladies Aid."
So we organized the Department of Christian Social Relations. And when we were getting ready for the next general conference, when people were going to be called in to head different departments or participate in different departments, I was the fxrst Negro woman that was named by the Board of Missions and Church Extensions to serve through the woman's division on that board and I served eight years.
Thank you, Mrs. Adair. Speaking of plaques and citations, I think also I see one from the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority. I suspect you treasure it very much and would you want to comment on that and then you may want to comment on some of the others. You have such a great number.
Yes, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority locally used to have a system of selecting a "Woman of the Year" and the way they would do it, they would send out a kind of proclamation to all the organized groups around about the area and telling them it was time and asking them to name somebody. Well, the woman who would get her name sent in by the largest number of organizations, they would select her as the "Woman of the Year." So, 1952, Christia Adair's name was submitted and I was made "Woman of the Year" for the Zeta Sorority.
Well, I never could join a sorority because it takes a lot of money to belong to sororities and I didn't have any and so I couldn't join. But they did have the friends to Zeta, called them Amicae and I became a member of that, so I am a life member of that.
Among the plaques on the wall is an award from the women's suffrage. I think I told you about when I lived at Kingsville, I worked with the women to help get a bill passed entitling women to vote. In 1974, they were celebrating the 54th anniversary of the woman's suffrage and I was named honoree of the observance. I had broken my hip, and I was out of circulation and I was in a convalescent home when they found me. So they brought the beautiful plaque and flowers and some very sweet young people over, and held the honoree services over at this home. I thought my hip was broken and I couldn't move, but I think I shouted that day.
It reverts back to when they had the national women's political caucus in Houston. The chairperson asked that all the people who worked in the woman's suffrage movement, to stand up. I was there as a delegate﻿36
CA:	(cont) from the Methodist Church Woman's Division of Christian Ser-
vice on the caucus and when I stood up, well, the ahs and the boos and oohs and the whys and everything went out.
And somebody said, "Mrs. Adair, did you understand what they were asking for?" I said, "Yes, I did." "Well, how did you work for woman's suffrage?" And I said, "I'm glad you asked the question and I'm glad to tell you." And so when I told them that, then that made me a woman suffragette, and I was the honoree on this 54th anniversary.
Another plaque that you might have seen was from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference activities where I helped to get people to go to Atlanta, Georgia, to help Dr. King with his efforts, and participated during that time and ever since to try to keep it promoted and alive. I have been in conferences where Mrs. King herself was still active and I still try to keep the principles of it.
When we had the sit-in movement in this town, ... have I said anything
about the sit-ins?
DRR:	Talk about it.
CA:	Young people in this county were very impatient, didn't think that
we were moving fast enough on opening doors in this county. So they took it upon themselves to begin marching on eating places and playhouses and things like that. I was out of the NAACP office, but I had to step back in and join with them, because I didn't want them to do it wrong. And I was able to get them to take on the principles of Dr. King's movement, with no violence. Had them to understand that I will support you, I'll back you up, I'll get all the people with you, but I will not do anything for you if you can't promise me that there'll be no violence. You won't fight back, you'll do it his way. And that's what they did and I have a plaque on that.
Thank you so very much. I notice that your certificate certifying you as a suffragette comes from the National Organization of Women. I believe that's the organization that we refer to as NOW. Mrs. Adair, I believe you have indicated that you would like to reverse yourself a moment and give something more about your philosophy of supporting a candidate. I'll be very happy to hear it.
Mrs. Robinson, I think that I have had a lot of experience with the various kinds of candidates. I have had candidates from all walks of life to look for me to help them get elected. And the way they would want me to help them would be the influence I'd have over getting out the vote. I have always let them know that my only interest in helping people get elected to an official capacity was because I thought, from my very heart, that they were the people that were going to improve the condition or it was putting the right person in the right place.
DRR:
My interest in elections has always been the voter education and registration interest. I have never been satisfied and am still not satisfied﻿37
CA:	(cont) with the number of Negroes who take part in elections and use
their voters' strength and their citizenship rights to get candidates elected, to get issues approved, and objected to,
DRR;	Thank you. I notice that since you have been named to cooperate with
this project from Radcliffe College, that still another honor has come to you, so you're still being recognized. Isn't there something in the wind about a park here in Harris County being named the Christia Adair Park? Tell us about it.
CA:	Yes, that is something very new, very recent. I have just been approached
and informed that they had this grant of land in precinct one, of which Commissioner Tom Bass is the Commissioner. The group of people who were concerned about it said that the first thing they wanted to do was to find a name for it. And after some inquiries and conversation, my name was suggested foremost and they have come to my house and here, ... I'll show you the chart of the grounds where the park will be. It's a beautiful outlay, I think, and it will be named Christia V. Adair Park. I hope from the very depths of my heart that nobody will ever mutilate my name by mutilating the parkgrounds.
Before I knew about this, I also knew that a group of students from the Carter Woodson Junior High School ... I know one time they worked on an interview, got a resum^ on some things pertaining to me. They were not satisfied with the amount of information they had so they tried it over again. The first issue - it went in the Texas Sampler, But they have recently had other interviews and gone through scrap-books and other material that I had and set out a 20-page essay that was presented at the recent meeting of the Texas Historical Society. And they call it the Junior Historical Club. They presented their essay and their teacher, Mrs. Virgil Gay, took the children up to Austin last week to their conference and their essay on Christia Adair won first place. So those are two things that are of recent recognition that I'm experiencing.
DRR:	You've indicated earlier that you never did anything alone or you
always knew that you couldn't. You always had to have cooperation and you always had a following. I think for the sake of history and permanent record it might be interesting to include the names of some people who have been very supportive of your efforts. Would you like to list some of those?
Oh yes, I'm glad you asked me that because there are so many people that I appreciate. And while these honors are coming out, being presented to Christia Adair from time to time, I, from the depths of my heart, know that I couldn't have done any of them without some of the grand people who have helped.
Back in the days of Kingsville, some of those women who are still with us and some who have passed on, like Camelia Hampton, Frankie Prothro, Kitty Simmons, Eva Durdan, oh, just any number of women that I could name, who went along with the things we were trying to do. And in this town with NAACP and civic club promotion, the man that I named, that﻿38
CA:	(cont) organized the Council of Organizations, he was president of
the strongest first civic club. Then a man named Sid Hilliard, whose family is well known all over the state of Texas, a pioneer Texas family. Sid Hilliard was one of the bravest men, had more courage than any one man I think I have ever known. All of us who knew Sid, knew there had been a time that Sid had not proven opposition to vice, not a crime, but sometimes vice. But when time came for him to take a stand against the things that were going to do something to people and going to affect society, he would come out and take a chance on sticking his neck out to call names and identify people that he knew could just take a gun and shoot him down. But he would take a chance at doing it.
Dr. Lonnie E. Smith, the man that served as a plaintiff in the primary case.
A man named Manuel Henry, a man of just ordinary day-by-day living and activities, no confab about what he did. He did it nonchalantly and
without any expectation of recognition, but all you'd do was touch his number and you had somebody there.
George Nelson, a barber, right now in the Atlanta Life Building, was almost a walking bureau of information. Anything that George Nelson doesn't know and you ask him about it, if you give him till sundown, he'll find the answer, A thorough, hard-working man. He was the chairman of the Committee on Labor when I was Executive Secretary and we opened doors in all of these industries, where Negro men could move up into the line of progression. Under his leadership, we did a lot of good to break down barriers in the field of labor.
There are some white people that were strong supporters in Harris County Democrats and in all civil rights movements that we had. A man who is an attorney today, Cyril Smith, another Smith, J. Edwin Smith, Chris Dixie, Bill Kilgarland, young men like Don Walton. And of course, our own legislators that we have now, who grew up through the Youth Council of the NAACP and sit-ins and things like that, Mickey Leland, Craig Washington, young men like that. I feel like that whatever I have done, they've all made their staunch contributions. A young woman, well, she's a middle-aged woman now, Lillie Alonzo, when we were trying to open the cafeteria at the County Courthouse, Lillie Alonzo was brave enough to come and get in line to be served, knowing that we couldn't be served, but we needed to start a fight and she was one to start the fight with us.
Lillian Bonner, a young mother, who dared to leave other duties alone and come and go when they said that separate schools were immoral. And NAACP ... looked like it was lagging back on ... I was out of the office but I just had an urge to do something. And I got her and Robinson and one or two other women and we got in cars and went to ring doorbells to let the mothers know that they didn't have to send their children away across town to school, send them to the closest school to them. We were responsible for the first Negro children entering into the formerly all-white schools because they were entitled to﻿39
(cont) go to the closest school to them.
A woman who has gone on, named Viola Flick, a domestic worker, but a woman that I would match with any woman of courage or will to serve, a Christian woman, a noble woman,
A dentist in this town, another dentist, Dr. Fred D. Parrott, the late Dr. Fred D. Parrott, who was a man that put nothing in front of an opportunity to serve society and humanity. His wife, who was a former school teacher in the county, and she passed on, and she was helpful in the women's work program. Everybody knew and loved Molly Parrott because of her dynamic stand that she would take on her own conviction.
I could go on and on and name hundreds of women and men of various races. I know some Mexican women and some Mexican men, Laure Cruez, A. D. Adias, and men like that, John Herrara who is an attorney here. He started out beautiful, I thought, so much so that he called himself the Mexican NAACP. He and I have done a lot of activities together in Brotherhood Week and things like that. All of a sudden I looked upon television and saw him going with Allan Shivers to lay a wreath on the unknown soldier's grave and it just seems like to me that he is a lost chord. I haven't been able to put my finger on anything that he has ever done since, unless it included just a class, a certain group of people, not the general Mexican. He was president of the Lulacs, but it looks like the Lulacs has not meant to the Mexicans what it used to mean. They had to organize in El Paso so what they called the lowly Mexican could have something to turn to.
And I'm just proud of all the people that ever called on me to help and those that I could call on, and I'm thankful for the response that has exchanged between us.
And I can't forget the ministers. Take Reverend A.A. Lucas, a man that was worldwide known. He was the president of NAACP for numbers of years and did a lot of good.
Reverend L. H. Simpson, who has also passed on, that became the NAACP president when I first went into the NAACP office.
A Methodist minister named Philemon Titus who was pastoring a small church, Ebenezer Methodist Church. I don't care what the program was, what we had to do, all I had to do was to tell him that we needed support from all the memberships of all the churches. It may not be much, but Monday morning he would bring me some money. And that happened many times,
I would also like to say that the 12 years that I was with the NAACP, there was a lot of crime and police brutality and a lot of things. We had an incident where a young man killed a bus driver, because he felt imposed on and was rejected and pushed back and knocked down. And in self-defense, he had a little penknife in his hand that he'd been picking his fingernails with, and he pushed it into the jugular vein of﻿40
(cont) the bus driver and that killed him. Well, the case proved out not to be because the bus driver was right or because anybody cared a lot about him, because he had the reputation of disturbing the peace, but this young Negro man had married a white girl in San Francisco. The day that he killed a white bus driver, he got off of the bus and was not identified for some weeks after that.
When he got off the bus, he left his cap, and it had a theater ticket from San Francisco in it. Some weeks after that, the case had not been solved; they couldn't identify the man. And some Negro deputy sheriff told the high sheriff that he knew where a Negro man was living with a white woman. Well, you know what that meant to a white man, when he hears that. And so everything else ,,, Nothing counted as long as it went, but when they went to see about that, they found that the young people were married. They had their marriage license and the marriage license was made in San Francisco.
They tied the theater ticket and the license location together and he confessed. TT if; • vie a terrific case ... of a Negro man, being married to a white woman and her being happy with him and wanting him, and stayed around with his people and wherever she could stay, to be around to see how the trial was coming out. He was charged with murder, and his penalty was already assessed before the court. Attorney Durham from Dallas, Attorney Dent from Galveston, Attorney Doyle from Houston were the attorneys that we selected. Reverend Simpson was the president then and it was through his influence and these other men, Hobart Taylor and Julius White, that we selected these men. And we had to first lay the main case on the shelf, because they said that he couldn't have his peer of jurymen, because Negroes were not qualified to serve on juries.
So in order to prove that we were, we laid the John Lee Morris case aside, and then went out and subpoenaed people to prove that we had people in all walks of life that could not only serve on juries but could do anything. Today they are serving on grand juries, commissions, not only grand juries, but the commissioners.
But I think through the leadership of some of our Negro ministers, we were able to accomplish something. That case was cruel. We saved the young man's life. We saved his life but I don't think we could get his sentence commuted and now he is paroled. But we were able to solve the other case about participation of Negroes in the courts because of the fine leadership that the ministers offered and supported us with.
That's a beautiful illustrat ion of the support that you've had through the years. I'm wondering now if you sometimes ... I know you had opposition. Did you sometimes have opposition from your own people, from the black people?
Yes, my heart bleeds when I say it, but we have always had, we did have then and we do have now. On this scale that we are so prone to believe everybody but ourselves, and we doubt our own leadership, and we're so afraid to venture out. If the white man said one thing and a Negro﻿41
CA:	(cont) said another, we don't seem to know where to place our values
in making our selections. And I have known Negro men to run against candidates that we had screened and selected and proposed. And they ran against them, which meant that they couldn't get elected. They split the vote and a Negro, the choice of white persons was elected. So it would just open the door for the enemy to stay in and keep in.
We had a lack of cooperation. We are afraid to venture and I like bravery. I like people to, ... If you can't do it, find out why you can't do it. Don't just stop and say, "Well, they're going to do what they want to do anyhow, stay home." But we have run into a lot of that. It's done a lot of harm to us and some even have made incriminating remarks about me. When we were trying to get the school cases through, some of the teachers said I was making them lose their jobs. In the Methodist Church when it was trying to bring integration to pass, which has always been in the Methodist Church and never practiced, well, some of the Negro ministers said it was making them lose their autonomy.
In the case of the teachers, I would say that if you can't teach at Lamar High School, I don't want you teaching at Dodson, that's the school closest to me. And if you can't pastor First Methodist Church on Main Street, I don't want you pastoring Boyington, which is my church.
It goes without saying, Mrs. Adair, that in your many years of service, that you have known personally many important political figures, ^nd two Texas women come to my mind now, I think of Barbara Jordan and Sissy Farenthold. Do you know these ladies? Did you have anything to do in working with them and their political activities?
CA:	Yeah, I think I've known Barbara Jordan for about five generations. Her
family, the Jordan family, came from my little home town, Edna, Texas. Her great-grandfather reared seven of the finest men I've ever known, without a wife. His wife died when the son who is my age was born. But he reared his seven boys, gave them the advantage of the best of education that was available for Negroes in that time. And I've never known anything that we could say that those men were a criticism on society. Barbara Jordan's daddy was a fourth-grade student when I was teaching in Edna, Texas. When Barbara first launched out to run for office, I guess I must have helped a lot because I heard her say that "Christia Adair has the best organized precinct I have ever seen or encountered. And her precinct did percentage-wise, a larger vote for me than all the other precincts."
I think she's made a good mark. She did one thing in her lifetime that I hate and it hurt me. I recommended her to serve as the most outstanding citizen from Texas to the awards services of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People some years ago, and she not only didn't acknowledge it, she didn't come, she didn't say anything. I brought the plaque home and she made some kind of excuse, but the plaque is in my desk drawer right now because she didn't even appreciate it enough to come and get it. I just thought that, as a young woman, that she owed it to all of the Negro women of America to﻿42
CA:	(cont) do the very least that they asked her to do. And that was
all they asked her to do, was to come and appear and receive the award.
Sissy Farenthold has come into the picture, oh, quite young. When I lived at Kingsville, Texas, and I was working with the woman's suffrage movement, her mother lived at Corpus Christi. The towns were at best about 47 miles apart, which meant that the women of the two towns were kind of together in their work. Then through main contact with Miss Carlton and other women in their family, and after she began aspiring for political jobs herself, and I found out she was Mrs. Carlton's daughter, I made some inquiry to see if she was like her mama and she is. I put all my strength and influence behind getting out the vote for her on all occasions and to help her succeed in whatever she's trying to do. I think she is a noble person and she is blessed with a lovely family.

Mrs. Adair, I looked through your album over there and I saw some pic-
Lures that were labelled "scenes from your retirement party." I'd like to know what it is you have retired from. It seems to me you're still in action. Would you tell me about this retirement party?
Well, after having served these 20 years as a precinct judge, I had to stop because I was very tired. And then I also thought that I should make it possible for some younger person to get in that position, while I was still around to help them get started. So I retired, I think it was in '72, and the Harris County Democrats had a retirement party for me.
It was at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Bacon on Bentz Street and 1500 people signed my register, a cross section of people, and it was a very beautiful affair, so many beautiful flowers, so many beautiful sentiments. They did it on "This is your life" plan and my brother was the first person to be called on, and on down the line. And people from all over the state who had worked with me, from church and from NAACP and what not, were here to the testimonial affair and I was a very happy old lady.
Knowing the role that you have played in many controversial issues and in many circumstances that were very tension-producing, I know you know a great deal about some of the things that have happened that are not very pleasant. And I'm recalling that on past occasions I read a great deal about police brutality in Houston. Do you think the things that the news media have released at various times might have been valid? Did we really have police brutality and do you think it still exists, if it ever did?
Oh yes, we've had some terrible incidents and some very brutal policemen. During the days I was with the NAACP, I almost could bet you money on that, if they arrested a Negro, they were going to take him out on the outskirts of town somewhere first and beat him up, and then bring him back and throw him in jail. And hardly anybody ever was put in jail that came out without being beaten. And they always said they﻿43
(cont) sometimes would have to tie their feet and hands and beat them down and all that to subdue them. But I never could understand how a man with his feet tied and his hands tied had to be knocked around They have stomped men in the jail that were accused of rape. They have taken men and women out on the outskirts of town and beat them.
I remember one young woman, in '52, whose husband shot a policeman, and he, whatever happened, he left. She couldn't tell them anything about it because she didn't know, but they took her out and took a rubber hose around her neck, and pulled her up on the rafters of a barn and beat her, trying to make her say, and she couldn't know. And they just released it and let her fall, broke her pelvis and just has ruined her for life. The grand jury one time put out an appeal that anybody who knew anything about brutality at the pea farm, to report it. Well, the files of NAACP were just full of pictures and statements from police brutality, so I sent the foreman a letter and asked him if he'd be interested in knowing details. He said, "Yes, anywhere." So when I told him what I had, they subpoenaed me to come to the grand jury. And so I had photostatic copies made of all these things that I had, and I sent them in. And then when they subpoenaed me and I came in, they went through those things all over again, and they couldn't understand first why those cases were brought to me. I told them that's what the NAACP was for. It was a legal action organization and was for the protection and advancement of Negroes.
And when they began questioning me about people in the files and they said, "Why did you have some white pictures?" I said, "Well, I'm interested in people. And if they beat one person, they'll beat another And I showed them one I had and I said, "That one there, the man was sitting on the bus, and I have seen people from the police department look like so much liver, when I saw that man, I knew he'd been in jail and I asked him and he said, 'Yeah.' They beat him before he was sober and beat him after he was sober and were still beating him when he left there."
So, I said, "So they just beat people up. One old man, who was one of these fanatic preachers, they wanted to make him stop preaching and he wouldn't stop." I said, "Guess he couldn't stop, he didn't know how to stop." I said, "They beat him so. Some boys, white boys who were released from jail that night, came by my office the next day and told me what they saw and I have statements of that. And I had that old man's picture made and you all took his brains out for an autopsy, never did replace them and the old man had seven holes in his head." I said, "He isn't buried yet. I've held up the funeral." I said, "He's over there in the undertaker's parlor right now."
But anyway, we had lots of it but that case about the young woman who they beat up, I think we came very close to putting the high sheriff in federal prison because the FBI got on it. I don't ever know what happened, I can't know, it couldn't happen today I don't think without us knowing, but we didn't know a whole lot of techniques then. But the woman disappeared, we never did know what happened to her or where she went, so the case just died out. But I think she left, we didn't get﻿44
(cont) to go through, but I think it served a great purpose in breaking up a lot of sheriff and police brutality because I think Buster Kerns was looking into federal prison when we got it out, when they dropped it.
I think that now we're experiencing police brutality a little worse than we have in the last few years. I'm not in a position to know really what is happening. I can't defend anybody, can't say, because I don't ever believe that a case gets so drastic and so terrible that police would just have to walk up and pull his gun and start shooting. And that seems to be what's going on now. I say, I know that a lot of policemen are being killed, and have been killed because I think Negroes are tired. They look up and see one coming, they say, "Well, it's going to be death either way," so they just kill first. I hope it's not like that but it certainly does look raw to me.
Mrs. Adair, you have been involved in so many things. You have accomplished so many things. I just wonder if any one thing or any group
of things stand out ir» your mind as being your most important achievements in life. Can you sort of look back and decide on some of those things and tell about them?
Mrs. Robinson, I think the eight years of my life at Kingsville, Texas, were the most fruitful part of my life because I was a very inexperienced young woman. I had lived a very sheltered life, but I was taken into a railroad community, where people didn't know a lot of things about culture or about respecting people, and a lot of women who were afraid to take a stand for right or to turn down the wrong, but I lived there and I made friends. Any time I can say now to somebody, "I'm coming to Kingsville," well, it's just like going back home and everybody's very cordial and I just feel good with the people there. Yet a whole lot of people of the generation that were there then have gone on, and what's there now are the children and grandchildren, but they remember Mrs. Adair through their parents or grandparents. It's just like going back to my little own home town. I don't have a relative down there at all but when I go into Edna, I feel free to go and while I'm there, I'm happy there.
Now, in Houston, well, there's been so many things, as I've kept saying, that have been done along with other people. It's kind of hard to say which is the most important. Everything and anything that happened, my interest and my time turns back to my church because that was my starting point. That's where I learned to serve. That's where I learned to live. That's how I learned that if ever I wanted friendship, I must be a friend. And I don't know, I never had any money in my life. My parents were poor. But I have always had a wealth of friends. And I think when you have friends, whether you have any money or not, you're rich indeed because you can have a zillion dollars and no friends and you're poor indeed. So if I have merited anything, I think it's the beautiful masses and cross sections of friends that I've had. And the reason I can count on them is because I've had evidence in my life when I needed them and I had them.﻿45
CA:	(cont) When my husband died, I needed friends and I had them, who
stood by me until I could get started, because I didn't know how to live alone, I didn't know how to work alone, I didn't know how to do anything. I didn't know how to go out and look for a job. But people stood by and then after I got out in life, and got employment and got to working, then I knew that it was going to take all kinds of people to help me have a rich full life. I couldn't have a select group.
For instance, in younger days, I didn't think I could get happy or respond to religious emotions anywhere but the Methodist church. But when I got out to working in life and found out that I needed all kinds of people to help, and in a lot of cases I could get more Baptist people, more Catholic people, than I could Methodist people. So then I knew that denomination and church connection was a very small item in your life. The main thing is, can you reach people and can you be reached by them? So this day, at 83, I can just stand in one spot and know that whatever happens to me, somebody cares.
That's a very beautiful statement, or rather, very beautiful statements. What do you think about women's lib? About this new liberation that so many women are clamoring for?
CA:	Well, I never can remember the day when I wasn't liberated. I think
there's maybe some category of women who haven't had an opportunity to serve, but Negro women have always been in a position to work and do things that they wanted to do. Now in this culture or in this generation, in this time, when they are aspiring for jobs that require better preparation, I just think if they just go on and prepare, that just like some of us took it upon ourselves to fight for votes, some others took it upon themselves to fight to have advanced education and got it, I think we can go on and do it too. I don't think anybody has to fall out about any of it.
DRR:	i'm happy to get your reaction to the women's liberation movement. Now
I'd like to know if you feel that many barriers have been placed before you or if many doors have been closed because you are a member of the Negro group.
CA-:	Oh yes, you can't be a Negro without having walked up to some closed
doors or had them shut when you got there, but so far, thanks to His grace, I found a way to get them open. And I have made a practice, if I get employed or get involved in anything where there haven't been any Negroes, if I get in there, I don't stop until somebody else gets in there.
Up to 1968, nobody worked at the county courthouse but white women. And the county clerk, who had been impressed with some of my attitudes about things, and who had almost singlehandedly been responsible for Negroes getting employment in the county courthouse, asked me one night at a grand jury association dinner if I would work with him. And I was so much impressed with him and the way he had done since he'd been our county clerk until I said, "Yes, anything you're doing, just tell me." And so he said, "I want you to work with absentee voting,"﻿46
(cont) Well, I kind of chided back then because I'd never done anything about it. He said, "You didn't know how to be a precinct judge at first." So he suggested I go and get an application.
I went on and had an application made. After some kind of little hassle about age, and he made people down at the courthouse know that I wasn't looking for retirement benefits, I was looking for a temporary job, well, I was employed. That was in '68, and when I went to work, nobody was there but 14 white women. They were the poorest of white women and that is no reflection on anybody for being poor because
--- They were not any poorer than I was; we were just a lot of poor
women together. But they certainly didn't have any more than I had.
But it was so ... just terrible complexing to them. They didn't know what to do with me. The very fact that I wanted to be working with them, and I think the first thing, they were afraid I was going to want to eat with them. And they began trying to find out how they were going to get me to have my lunch ahead of them so they wouldn't be bothered. Well, I worked that out, X think, in a very good way, and by the next day, we were eating lunch together. Then when the supervisor said we needed more help and told us all to bring somebody, and that was a weekend. Well, when I came back at the beginning of the next week, I brought somebody. And I didn't want anybody to ever think that I am selfish, let me say it like this ... I was born a Negro, I've been a Negro all my life, happy to be one and feel honored to be one. Everything I do, I want it to represent the best side and best interest of Negroes. But I do not ever want the day to come that I would be classed as being somebody that wasn't concerned about anything and anybody else but Negroes, because I am concerned. So when I went back Monday morning, I carried two Negro women, one white woman and one Mexican woman. I was setting a precedent to let them know, none of them should go out and just bring in some more white women, because that's all they did do. And if I hadn't brought that one Mexican woman, maybe the Mexican woman would not be working up there. Thanks to His grace, in '77 that job is just like a League of Nations. Between 45 and 50 women work up there every year and we work together b eautifully. The fellowship is perfect and we have no big I's and little you's and we're all serving our capacity in the best of our ability.
That would be one instance where I think that doors are closed, lot of people don't know any better than to close a door. A lot of white people think that they can't serve and can't work with Negroes. But once you push the door open and put your foot in it and keep your foot in it until somebody else comes in there, they find out that they too can work with other people besides themselves. And we learn a lot from each other.
In working in the Methodist Church which has had integration in its policy for a thousand years nearly, today we still have to break some doors open to get in. And it's been my policy, every one that I see closed that I want to go in, I go in it, and don't stop till I get in there. And then when I get in there, all I want to be sure is that I'm not taking somebody in there that will reflect on my efforts. I﻿47
CA:	(cont) don't want somebody in there who's going to go in there and
play on the job or play on the position. I want them to go in there and represent it and don't try to let a job make you; you make the job.
DRR:	Thank you for that observation. Mrs. Adair, it's been something very
interesting to me and it has also aroused my curiosity. Throughout this interview, it seems to me that you have deliberately refrained from using the word 'black.' Do you have any special reason for not using the word 'black'? Is it distasteful to you in some way?
CA:	Mrs. Robinson, how old are you?
DRR:	68.
CA:	Well, at 68, you wouldn't know some of the things that I know about
that. But I came up in a generation, where to most white people I was a black wench and all the Negro men were black sons of bitches. I could never see them do anything but ridiculing the race with the color black. They say black is beautiful. Well, it is beautiful, when it's applied where it belongs, but I don't think it has any business describing me as a person. And then I can't acknowledge you calling me black; I'm not black and I have no way to be black. And the reason I'm not black is because a white man fell in love with my grandmother and so I just don't see any reason why I should be called black.
And as I said, when in my hard-working days, one of the first things I had to encounter, one of the stores here in Houston, Bonds Clothing Store, put up a scene in his show window, a display of cotton week, the advance of cotton week. And what he did was to put a woman in there, fixed her to represent the average black mammy, and then had a whole lot of little children and they were as black pickaninnies. They were picking cotton and she was pulling a heavy cotton sack on her back. They were picking the cotton and putting it in the sack. And everywhere that you saw things, the minstrels and everywhere, Negroes were ridiculed by painting them black, with white teeth, white eyes and red lips. Well, if black is going to be used to ridicule me, I don't want to be black. And I know I'm a Negro and when I have spent over three-quarters of my life representing the Negro race, and holding up for the Negro race and trying to advance it, why now at this late stage in the game, must I let somebody turn me around and change me from my race to the color of my skin.
I can't see what the color of my skin has to do with anybody. If I would use that word, I would say, "The Negro race, regardless of color, is included in this ..." I couldn't say all-black because it couldn't be all-black, because in the Negro race there would be some white ones, some yellow ones, some brown ones, some red ones, some all colors would be in there and yet they would be Negroes. Now, how could I call them all black?
The other thing about it is that it seems like a sarcasm or something. We spent so many years trying to help white people to say the word "Negro"﻿48
CA:	( cont) and they couldn't say that. They couldn't stop saying "Nig-
ger" to save their lives. And they'd say "Nigra" and something like that. But as soon as some Negro, young Negro, who felt that she was in a position in leadership, and she herself is really black and in her instance, black is beautiful, but she seems to have thought that that would be an honor to her to get all the Negroes changed around to feeling black. Well, it hasn't been any credit to me and I don't care for it. I don't like it.
I have scars on my brains and my heart, taking signs down in municipal buildings and all public things that say "For whites only." Well, okay, if I didn't want any signs up there saying "For whites only," I don't want any signs up there saying "For blacks only." So I'm not going around and helping anybody put up any signs for blacks only, because I can't see any good in it. When the street cars were labelled, there's a little card up there which said "Colored," and this one would say "White." Well, it meant that I had to stand up. Just as long as somebody who was not Negro was coming in that car, I could sit. But aa long as somebody else was coming, regardless to their color, Orientals, Mexicans, everybody, I had to stand up. Well now, that's because I was under the sign of "black." Well, I don't want no black sign and I don't want any white sign, I don't want any signs.
The white man started out calling Mexicans "brown" about the same time they started identifying my race as black. They started identifying Mexicans, all Latin people, as brown. But the Mexicans had good common sense. They have stopped them at the bat. You don't ever hear the word "brown," any more, it's "Mexican-American." And that's what they are.
Well, I am a Negro-American. I will never, never, never accept the word as a black woman. I don't want anybody calling me a black, I'm not black. And black will never be any damnation or reflection on me. The color of my skin has nothing to do with it. I have lived my life in such a way to be a credit to humanity and to my nation, as well as my race.
DRR:	You know, Mrs. Adair, we have spent some hours now talking about the
serious side of your life and your serious endeavors and all, but surely you must have something just for entertainment, something to fill the lighter moments of your life, if you have the lighter moments. I'd like to know something about your hobbies. Well, in fact, I've already gathered something from visiting here in your home. I noticed a beautiful handmade bedspread that, I think you said, won first prize at an exhibit someplace. And then for lunch we had the very delicious lettuce salad and the lettuce, you say, came from your own garden and that you do your own vegetable garden work as well as your flower garden at age 83. Could you tell me some more about your hobbies? Other than gardening and handwork or you may elaborate on those if you'd like.
Well, I don't let myself get idle and if nothing is going on out in the world that I can get into or be a part of or nosy to or tampering to, then I find something at home to do because I can't be idle. I love﻿49
(cont) my yard. I guess I was not really in the rural, but I lived close enough to the rural and in a small enough town. I did study agriculture at Prairie View and I do apply it until this day and time with a lot of things that I learned. And then the months that I worked with the County Extension and Agricultural Department, I learned some more. And I apply that. I love to work with the dirt. I love to be out in the open. I love to go fishing. Because it seems that when I'm out there with the dirt going through my fingers and cultivating seed and rooting plants and changing things around and beautifying, then when they mature, when they bloom or they produce vegetables, then I can thank God that He let me help Him do that,
I go fishing. I like to set off. If I don't get a strike on the line, at least I'm there looking across the water seeing the sun come up, the moon rise or something going on across the water that makes me know that God's love is just as expansive as His distance, and that I'm a part of all of that. I have very impaired eyesight now, but before my eyes were bad, I did do a lot of art work. I think the most beautiful thing in the world is to say, "This is mine because I made it."
My mother was a very industrious woman. She sewed beautifully. She made everything that her children wore and herself. And when I was getting ready to be married, together we made my hope chest. Everything that was in there, every sheet, every pillow case, every dish towel, everything, had some kind of hand embroidery, something, crocheted or something about it. And I have been able to take some of those wedding presents and put ... I have two little nieces. My sister's daughter has two girls, and I have been able to put things out of my hope chest into each of their hope chests, because I made them myself, and I thought that would enhance their interest in it.
I don't know, I just like to be busy and I can find a lot of things to do. I don't know whether I have said this or been talking about this camp that the Federated Club Women own up at Alvarado, Texas, up in Johnson County. But there's a lake up there and we keep it stocked with good fish. It's just a joy for me to encourage somebody to come, go to Camp McMullen, and let me go with them so I can fish. And then I just like to get up there in the open air and take a lot of people with me. If I have any interest at all in my life, it's young people. Nothing makes me happier than to see young people in action. I don't have anything too good for them to use, if it's going to help them, to be involved in things that's worthwhile and to show some interest or something. But when I see young people, regardless of race, creed or color, playing on a job and neglecting their part or position, it hurts my heart because I know that's just like re-crucifying me.
Thank you. I have sat here the whole morning admiring your furniture. You have some lovely antique pieces as well as your cut glass. I would imagine some of these pieces have a very interesting history. Were they handed down from other generations? They must have been. I can judge that from the age and the style.
Yes. Most things with any value to them came from somebody else, because﻿50
(cont) my husband and I never had enough money to buy them. We bought what we needed and enjoyed what we bought. We never had anything for company. Whatever we had, we used it. And I've enjoyed my things. But I do have some things that came from my mother's home, some came from my godmother's home, that are very, very old. A rocking chair from my paternal grandfather, a rocking chair from my maternal grandmother, a washstand that my husband converted into a side table. Made it with an old washstand that was from my paternal great-grandmother. And pieces of dishes that came down from several generations. I have one cream pitcher there that I guess it was my great-great-great-grandmother's. Must be three generations of great-grandmothers; it's hobnail.
The dining room table that I have now was our family table. My mother reared us around that table. I remember when Mama got the table, it was not a new table. Now, where she got it from, I don't know, but it had come from some other person in the family. Now, I don't know, but evidently the table must be around 300 years old, because if I'm 83 and I ate all ;;,v meals around it, and somebody else had used it before Mama got hold to it, and I'm using it now, well, then it must be pretty old. But it's beautiful.
As I said, that pitcher over there on that humidor, my godmother brought it from South Carolina when she married. She died at 97, about ten, nine or ten years ago, and she brought it here from when she married, so I don't know how long she had had it or its worth, but I know it's very old.
But a lot of things that I had, I don't have. I had an ugly experience of a friend of mine dying in a house by herself, and she had beautiful things that had a lot of value to them, and she had hoped for certain people in her family to have them and they knew. But somehow either they were slothful or excited or something, I don't know what happened, but by the time they did get there to get them, somebody else had taken them. So I made up my mind that it just wouldn't happen to me. If after being here a certain number of years, I know I couldn't have many more years, that I shouldn't die with them in the house, that I should let somebody get them. And that's what I have done. I have set up a practice that, if a girl in the family or friends, going to get married, I ask her if she likes old things. If she likes old things, she can come to my house and select her wedding present. And if she doesn't like old things, I try to cope with whatever plans she has about gifts. But I'm trying to pass them on and put them in the hands of people that will cherish the things just like I would. And so I don't have a whole lot of things left, but some things I have, I have to keep because I can't strip my house. But everything I have that's worthwhile, anybody else would want, is labeled already, because somebody has said that they want it.
Thank you, Mrs. Adair. Looking at your dining room table, which is certainly a very beautiful piece and it has certainly been well cared for, and the pitcher and the other items that you've mentioned, I know you cherish beautiful things. I'm hoping that the items that you give away will fall into the hands of people who will feel likewise.﻿51
DRR:	(cont) You know, there are so many current issues that are just
burning issues at the present time, and I feel that your attitude or your comments about some of these would be of value. For instance, it is generally said, or rather it is often said, that women of the Negro race are much more promiscuous and give themselves more to promiscuity and the birth of illegitimate children than happens in other groups. I'd like to know how you feel about that. Also while you're discussing that social issue, why don't you tell us how you feel about common-law marriages. I think you made some references to common-law marriages earlier in this discussion.
CA:	I'm going to start out by saying that I think the most beautiful and
wonderful thing that can happen to a woman is a pregnant married woman. I just almost reverence one and want to keep her on a pedestal. But I think the most pitiful and sorrowful thing that I can come in contact with is an unmarried pregnant woman. I don't scorn them. I have no right to be mean to them. I wish I could take them all to my heart and help them to do different by their coming birth than was done about them. Somebody seemed to have failed them in life.
I really believe, from the depths of my heart, that any mother that takes up enough time with her daughter can have as much influence over her daughter as anybody else. And if she explains and talks frank and open to her daughter and points out the dangers, I think that's much more helpful than giving her the pill. I think the pill is saying to your daughter, "Go out and be as promiscuous as you like. Just don't bring a baby home." I think that's cruel. And I think that's neglecting your own flesh and blood. My heart goes out so against illegitimate babies, and our law says that there are none, so maybe we will say "babies born out of wedlock." But I know, if after a baby is born and a couple separates, I know what a hard time that child has in life in a broken home. Well, I imagine a child that has got to come up never knowing the love of a father, and certainly if the mother is unhappy ...
It's just something that I have no scorn about it, I have no quarreling and things with. My own little godchild is an illegitimate child, but he's as dear to me as anything that ever lived, because I think that I'm responsible for whatever happens to anybody's girl or boy. If I can have a chance to say one word to them or reach them in any manner, I think ...
Now common-law marriages, it just looks like to me a waste of time. I never, never have seen any reason why a woman who thinks that her body means enough to a man to go and live with him without the marriage vows and without the sanctity of the church, I just can't understand her ... I just can't understand that at all. I have no manner of encouragement in it. I just abhor it. I think the man and the woman who do those things are thoughtless and idle-minded. If they keep their brains above the waistline, if they occupy themselves with useful things and fall in love properly, I think they can marry with the sanction of the church. If they marry and find out that the marriage was a failure, and they have to separate and divorce, that's almost﻿52
CA:	(cont) something you cannot help. But I think that every girl
ought to carry to her husband her chastity and her virginity. I think the man, all of her life, whatever else he thinks or does, he will honor that part about her. And I think every woman owes it to herself to protect her body from careless promiscuous handling of Tom, Dick and Harry.
DRR:	Thank you, Mrs. Adair. You've been a widow for some time, and you've
just made some very crucial statements about marriage and partnerships between men and women. I'd like to know, it's very personal however, if you've ever thought of remarriage and how have you coped with widowhood?
CA:	Well, I coped with that like I do with other situations and conditions
I find myself in. I take what I have and make the best out of it. When my husband died, I knew I didn't have a mate. I didn't have any business with anybody else's mate. X figured that those who don't have mates, must have been something wrong with them or they already would have been married.
The other thing about it, I don't think Negro women have ever had enough income and living resources to take a chance on losing what they had. My husband left me with a home and being an employee of the railroad, I knew that if I lived long enough, I would come in possession of a small income which might pay my utility bills, at least. Then I had no way in the world to be tired because I had rested 25 years and the only thing to do, instead of looking for a man, I got to looking for a job. And I find that if you keep your mind employed, then these other things don't disturb you too much.
If you're human and a healthy woman, you naturally desire the companionship of a male at some time or another. But if you find yourself getting off the beam about that and you're going to corrupt your whole life by mixing up, messing up the life that you've built, by letting some man drag you around, well, then just get on and find something to do and occupy yourself and get your brains above your waistline. That's the only solution I have.
I have wealth and worlds of men friends, but it doesn't take them long to understand that our friendship goes just this far and no further. I'm not going to say that I'm such a hard luck, bad luck woman that no man wants me or has wanted me, but I just haven't found one of them that I've wanted.
DRR:	Mrs. Adair, you have been a most unselfish and a most cooperative inter-
viewee. And I know that persons who read this or have an opportunity to examine it in years to come will regard you in the same light that I have learned to do in these few hours that I have known you, and that is that you are a very interesting, very dynamic, very moving, very effective, very purposeful woman. I just wonder if there might not be just some things, just a sort of potpourri of ideas or concepts that you might have, if you just want to talk about anything that you would like to include in this record, just feel free to express yourself in any way you'd like.﻿53
CA:	I would like to thank the persons who promoted this interview, especi-
ally the Schlesinger Library, and to Mrs. Robinson as the interviewer. I think it's a privilege when you can sit down and talk. Sometimes when I'm doing this, I do some of these reviews for school kids, I wonder if what you're saying is just killing time or if it has any value to it at all, if what you have done means anything to what somebody else is trying to do or if it will ever serve a purpose. But I think every time you have an opportunity to put down something that might help somebody, put it down. If it's their desire to kick it over and leave it, that's their business. But you can always know that you said it.
The people have a habit of saying ... When I said, "Don't let a child do so and so in your presence without reprimanding him or talking to him or doing something like that," they'll say, "I'm not going to say anything ... these children use so much vulgar language and ..." I say, "Well, they learn their vulgarity from us." So whatever they say, a profanity or a vulgarity, it doesn't hang on me, it doesn't touch me any kind of way. All I want to know is to be sure that if ever anything happens to his life about doing the things that he or she might be doing, they can say, "I sure did know better, because that old lady told me and I wasn't paying any attention to her." I want to be always on record as saying that I did warn you against it, I did show it to you, I did tell you. Rather than do that, to say that I was afraid of some little curse word or something that they might say, that I hold your parents responsible far more than I do you because if you didn't hear them say it, you wouldn't say it.
I think that if, in this life, any member of my family, and there are some young people, distant nieces and nephews, if they read this and it will be of any service to them to know that my auntie of many generations ago did this, maybe it will encourage them to do more. I'm always thinking about improvement on what each generation ... I don't think you ought to get static. If I did this, then I think you ought to add to what I did, and stop talking about what I did and say, "Now what am I going to do about it."
That's what Mary White, in whose brain the NAACP was born ___ Looked
down the street and saw, in Abraham Lincoln's home town, a Negro man being drug down the street and to the stake and burned. And she screamed out, "What would Abraham Lincoln say? What would he think if he was living today? What?" And said then God stopped her in her tracks and answered her, saying, "He's dead. What are you going to do?" And she began immediately making contacts with first one person and first one group. She herself went to jail and suffered a whole lot about everything because they called her an agitator and all, but she didn't stop until the NAACP came out from that decision and that effort. And she was an American white woman. You can't say the NAACP was always a Negro organization. It never has been. It was her brainchild. Until she died, she held an important place in the organization. So I think you never, never lose or throw away your time, when you decide that not what somebody else did, but what am I going to do with what I have?﻿54
DRR:	Thank you, Mrs. Adair, Mrs. Adair, I don't think we can afford to
close this interview without your telling us something about the passing of your parents.
CA:	I was very blessed to be grown when my parents and godparents died.
They lived old enough for me to return some of the tenderness and care for them that they gave me. My mother was the first experience in death in our family, and I think she died an early death, because she died at 62 in 1936. After she died, my father came to live with me and my husband, and he died in May, 1943, the same year my husband passed in October.
My godfather had died ten or twelve years before my godmother died. And my godmother died at 97 years old. And she's been dead ten or twelve years, somewhere along in those figures, I'm not too sure about the number of years or the year that she did pass. But they were survived, my godparents were survived by one son. I don't think when I was talking about their earlier years, I said that they had a son the same age as my younger brother, who was born ten years after I was, and their son was reared to respect and honor and love me as a sister, which meant that I had two little brothers at the same time, the same age, one at Mama's house, one at my godmother's house. And the godson is still living; he's in Los Angeles, California. He was principal of a school at Compton until he retired. He had served in Texas, at Huntsville and at Dennison, as a teacher. But he is the type of man that I am proud to call my brother.
DRR:
Mrs. Adair, thank you for a most interesting interview.﻿CHRISTIA V. ADAIR
