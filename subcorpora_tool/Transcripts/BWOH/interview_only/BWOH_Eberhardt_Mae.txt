This is part one of an interview with Mrs. Mae Massie Eberhardt. The interview is taking place in Mrs. Eberhardt's home, 134 Hansbury Avenue, Newark, New Jersey 07112. The date is November 5, 1979. The interviewer is Marcia Greenlee. Mrs. Eberhardt, you've worked in a wide range of areas. Would you please describe the most important aspects of your career?
Well, the most important aspect of my career was working with the International Union of Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers. I was there as a social action director, and that took in a whole gamut of things. You know, it dealt with politics, civil rights, and education, and organizing people into the labor movement, that kind of thing. That was the most important aspect of my work.
Now, what was your earliest, full-time, income-producing employment? Where did you first work?
Well, I first worked in a...it was a laundry cleaner, like. That's where I got my first experience before I was a union...
Where was that?
That was in Orange, New Jersey.
And your resume indicated that you became the shop steward there?
Yes.
What was the name of the laundry, do you remember? Yes. Orange and Domestic.
How did your union involvement begin there? Well, now, it's a lengthy story. Go ahead, yes?
When I went there, I was quite young, and I knew little of anything about a union.
How old were you?﻿2
ME: I can't remember now. I'm sixty-four now, and I can't think that
far. But I did know that a union was supposed to protect the worker. I knew that much. When I went there, I was sort of desperate because it was during the war, and I couldn't go into defense work because my daughter was little. At that time, they would screen you to the effect that if you didn't have proper child care, you couldn't take a job because you had to be able to work three shifts. So then the next thing was for me to go into that kind of work, and I did. I would always dicker about the wages, because what we were doing, I thought, on the job, had health hazards. Other people were dealing with the clean clothes, and we were dealing with dirty clothes, and I thought that our pay should have been more. But everyone was making the same thing, and I didn't understand that.
They had a girl there that was the shop steward, and she refused to talk about it. She found nothing wrong in that. So then I found out when they were having union meetings, and I would go to the union meetings and try to voice my opinion. But T never was successful, because it was what you call an amalgamated union. In amalgamated unions they have people from, let's say, four or five different shops where all sorts of grievances... and they'd deal with them collectively, so I couldn't get my point across. But I didn't stop there. I made a phone call to the union offices there, and told them my grievance. They said they would come up and look into it. And they did.
I was working with two other women—they were older than I at the time— and I guess those women were concerned about their jobs. I imagine I wasn't old enough or concerned enough to worry about that job, because it didn't pay all that much. And they left me there to wait alone for this union guy. So he came up, and I showed him our situation and explained to him, and he said that I had a legitimate complaint, and that they would come in on Monday—this was a weekend that I waited for him—they would come in on Monday and go into the office and try and negotiate a better settlement for us, along with the shop steward.
Well, she did not want to go into the office, because she was quite friendly with the employers there. Then I was getting very angry— she was a black woman, as well, and I got a thing about me fighting with black women, so I didn't want to fight with her, but by the same token, I wanted to do something about the situation. So I said to her then, "Would you mind if I go in your place?" She said, "If it's all right with them, it's all right with me." Well, then the union people had to go in and get permission from the employees to deal with me, because they weren't under any obligation to deal with me. But they agreed because I think they felt, "Well, she is kind of a sleaze, anyway." They agreed.
Well, we went in, and I sort of have to pat myself on the shoulder a little bit for this, because I put up such a pace that everybody was in awe. They had to look into it and do something about it, and they did. That job at that time paid 36<? an hour. And with my fight, we raised it to $1.55 an hour. Now I think that was wonderful.
MG: it was.﻿4
ME: It was Local 284, A.F. of L. Don't put the CIO in.
MG: Okay, they hadn't merged yet.
ME: They hadn't merged yet.
MG: Now you mentioned that you were working during the war. This was
the Second World War. Were you maybe late twenties, early thirties during that period, you think?
ME: Yes.
MG: Okay. And it was the Orange and Domestic Cleaners?
ME: Laundry.
MG: Laundry. What was Helen's last name?
ME: Wynn.
MG: Now, you say you stayed there, you were the shop steward for twelve
years, and the place went out of business. Then was your next employment as an electronics worker?
ME: Yes.
MG: Where did you work then?
ME: That was in Newark, Thirteenth Street, in Newark.
MG: What was the name of the business?
ME: Kuthe Laboratories.
MG: Now what did you do there?
ME: I didn't know anything about electronics, and they didn't have a union when I went there. The man asked me what did I know about electronics, and I said, "I don't know anything, but I'm willing to learn." So he says, "I'm going to give you a good job, and you'll get an opportunity to learn quite a few things about electronics." And he put me cleaning tubes. Now they made hydrogen tubes for the army.
MG: And you were given the job of cleaning.
ME: Cleaning. I suppose you want me to tell you the story?
MG: Yes. Please. Please?
ME: Well, he said to me when he put me..."Now these tubes are very expensive, so you must be very, very careful with them." Now what I had to clean off, they would have to bake the tubes—that means, bake the top cap on, and the base on. And as that tube is baking, some of the cement oozes out and is brown. You have to clean all that from around﻿5
ME: (cont) it. You got this little gadget, but if you go too fast, you would clip it. Well, now, in order to keep the job, I'm very, very careful. There again, it sounds like I'm talking about race, but it wasn't. But they had two German ladies working there, and one black lady. Black lady was doing the baking. Well, I always had long fingernails. That became the talk of, "How's she going to do that work with those nails?" That didn't bother me. But at one point, if I cleaned them, then they had to go over to one of the other ladies, one of the German ladies, for her to inspect—not my work, but to inspect the tube for its perfection, whether it was a good tube or a bad tube. And at one point I was so slow, she didn't have any work to do. Well, she went to the boss to make sure the boss knew that I was holding her up. She proceeded to sit like this at her position.
MG: With her arms folded.
ME: And that angered me greatly, really it did. So I just...I didn't
hasten a bit, and she finally went over and told the boss. This is not the one that hired me, but this is the boss of that department. When she came back to sit down—her English was very poor—I said to her, "I'm going to tell you something. When you first came here to work, you had to learn everything, including how to talk." I said, "Now if you bother me, you're going to forget everything you ever learned, including how to talk." I never had any more trouble in that department, and I went from the bottom to the top.
I did everything in the department. Now, the black girl, she didn't want to show me her operation, so I got a hold of the man that hired me—his name was Eric—and I said to him, "Eric, when you hired me, didn't you say you want me to learn everything in the department?" He said, "Of course." I said, "Well, they aren't giving me that opportunity." So he turned right around, came back in that department and says, "I want Mae to learn everything in this department." And the black girl said, "This one, too?" He said, "I said everything." Because I was a very swift worker once I learned to work, and I learned all the work. Now, it was a very good job. It had good fringes and everything, but you ran the risk of losing it all, you didn't have a union to protect it.
This fellow used to bring me to work, 'cause I lived in East Orange at the time, and that was in Newark. He used to pick me up and bring me to work, and I said to him, "You know, I can't understand a place like this without a union." He said, "Mr. Kuthe gives us everything that union shops get, or more." I said, "Yes, but Mr. Kuthe can take it from you just as fast as he can give it to you." He said, "Well, we don't need a union."
Well, I said to myself, "You'd better stop that talk or you'll lose your job." But I couldn't stop. I would talk about it in the ladies' room, and what have you. So at one point, the IUE, the International Union of Electrical Workers, sent their guys around trying to organize the shop, and they got to talk to a few of us about the union. Well, I knew about it. Then I got to talk more, and others would listen at that time, and I would say to them, "If we get a union, it's not﻿6
ME: (cont) anything against Mr. Kuthe. But what it will do, it will
solidify everything that Mr. Kuthe is giving you." I said, "Because you know there are rumors that ITT is going to buy this place." I think this was my work. I said, "Now, Mr. Kuthe knows every one of us by name and what we can do," I said, "but if a big conglomerate like ITT comes in here, all they'll know is your number on the card, and they can go down the list of the fringes that Mr. Kuthe has given us, and if they are not giving that to their other shops, they can take it away from us. But if we get a union, they can't take one [thing] from us that Mr. Kuthe gives us, other than that Christmas bonus." I said, "They may, can take the Christmas bonus. I don't know too much about that."
That got the plant in gear for the union. We had an election, and the union won. But now I wasn't...I didn't take an active part. All I wanted then was for the union to be in. So we had a man that was president—we figured a man got to be president. Well, he could care less about what happened to us. [laughs] I think he didn't know, really, I do. The union would allow him a certain amount of hours in the day for union activities; that meant to come around to different employees to find out if anything... And John would leave the place then. He'd say, "This is time...
MG: "I'm done." [laughter]
ME: Those two girls had left, the first two German girls, but we had
another German girl who was a doll. She was sweet. Kate. And hot solder popped on Kate one day, and you know, foreigners are afraid they're going to be...deported...
MG: Deported, mm hmm.
ME: Deported. Well, now, and they take a lot of things that they shouldn't take. So I said, "Kate, you've got to go to the doctor because you don't know how deep those burns are." And I fussed with Kate, argued with Kate. And then the big boss came in at the time, and I went and got him, and I told him what happened, and he looked at me. He said, "Why, Kate...can't Kate talk for herself?" I said, "Everybody seems to ignore her because she doesn't speak good English."
MG: Now, this was a Kuthe employer or a union person you were talking to about Kate?
ME: No, this was the boss of Kuthe. And so we got Kate to go to the doctor and take care of those burns and whatnot. We used to go to union meetings, and I would take the president on, you know. I would tell him what I thought he should be doing, and what have you. I was always very vocal. I think it's been my downfall in a lot of things.
At one point they wanted Mae for president. Well, the shop was 75 percent white, we would say, and about 60 percent male. Now, I'm thinking, "I'm not going to win it along those lines." I wasn't going to run. And a Jewish fellow came to me by the name of Sam Ballen, and Sam said to me, "Let me be the first to commend you, if﻿7
ME: (cont) you run. My vote, you have in your pocket, but you won't win it for the same reason that I wouldn't." I said, "Why is that, Sam?" He said, "Cause a black...because you're Negro, like I'm Jewish." "Then the hell, I'll jump in there for that reason and run." [laughter] I ran. Another white fellow ran. The then president, John, he refrained from running. Another white fellow ran, and I ran, and I won by a two-to-three margin, a three-to-two margin, that is. Then I was president till that went out of business. Because the girls in melding, which was 99 percent white, and election time would come up, they would start a jingle, "Nobody better not run against Mae." And I would tell them, "This is bad. You'll alienate people. You'll make them..." For some reason, I never had any opposition.
MG: So how many years was that, then, at Kuthe's?
ME: Thirteen years.
MGi That got us up, what, into the fifties sometime?
ME: Yes. This is in the sixties.
MG: Sixties?
ME: This is '63. And so ITT did buy Kuthe's, and then ITT moved the plant to Easton, Pennsylvania. A few employees, not those in the bargaining union, but other employees went with them to Easton, but none of us went. And then I went down to the IUE.
MG: And worked within the union organization itself.
ME: Yes.
MG: Before we got to discuss that period of your career, what was Eric's last name, do you remember?
ME: it was a German name that I couldn't even pronounce.
MG: Oh. And who was it at Kuthe's that said that you didn't need a union?
ME: That was the now William Eberhardt, my husband, [laughter] and he's an international representative for IUE now.
MG:	What was the first president of your local's name, John—what was it?
ME:	Dalton.
MG:	Dalton. Okay. And you remember Kate's last name?
ME:	S tephenanko.
MG:	And Sam's last name?
ME:	Ballen.﻿8
MG: Now, tell me about working for the IUE.
ME: Well, let me see, how'd I go down there? I was talking to a fellow that was...he was president of a local, and he was like national representative for civil rights. He knew that I was going to be out of employment, and I said to him, "Maybe I should go down to the district and try to get a job." He said, "Of course, why not?" So he called me and told me that he had set up an appointment—his name's Leo Smith—he had set up an appointment with the then president of the district, Milton W. Weihrauch. I said, "Well, he didn't call me." Well, he said he had set up an appointment. So I did not go, because I wanted him to call me; then I would feel that he was interested. So Leo called me that evening and was kind of angry with me because I didn't go down. I said, "I'm not going if Milton doesn't call me." So Milton did call me, and I went down, and a fellow by the name of A1 Lowenthal—you may know him. You know Al?
MG: I know that name.
ME: He had the position. Then I talked to Milton, and he said that I
could have that position. Al agreed that he felt that I should have it, too. As a matter of fact, Al felt that a black person should have it.
MG: Now this is the position of civil rights director.
ME: Right. And so I got that job.
MG: And this was in District 3, and you represented fifty locals, is that right?
ME: More than that.
MG: More than that?
ME: Because this was District 3, I represented maybe fifty locals in New Jersey...
MG: Yes, fifty locals in New Jersey.
ME- ...'cause I represented the whole state of New Jersey and the whole state of New York.
MG: New York. In '67 you became the executive vice-president of the New Jersey Industrial Union Council. Now my labor history is not as clear as it ought to be. Did you continue simultaneously with your civil rights position, and...
ME: Oh, yes. That was an elected position I had.
MG: i See. What did it involve?
ME: Well, it just really meant that I was one of the officers of that
Industrial Union Council. I was the first black woman ever elected﻿9
ME: (cont) to a state labor organization. That's what that was. I
didn't have too many duties there, because I still worked for the IUE.
MG: Now then you stayed as the civil rights director with the IUE until your retirement?
ME: Yes, but we changed the name of it. We changed the name from civil
rights director to human relations and then to social action. And that was the reason for it.
MG: Let's go back a little bit more about, just the meaning of this whole labor history, and your involvement in it. At the time that the IUE was coming around to Kuthe's and trying to get workers interested in the union and the rest, were they admitting blacks in any significant degree? Had they by then begun to admit them without restriction? This is the IUE.
ME: What do you mean? Like organize them into the union?
MG: Well, my understanding was that early on with the IUE, many of the
locals would keep blacks from entering, not through any specific written arrangement, just by agreement, that they could not enter the union, could not join. But now, in your case, you joined very readily.
ME: They couldn't do this. This may be true, but I don't see how it
could. Because, you see, when an agreement is agreed upon for a union to represent people, the company has a say, too. Well, the company sends in how many employees they have, and the union sends in how many they have in the bargaining unit, and it has to coincide somewhere. So how could you separate the blacks? Now, maybe they had some scheme or something. But I wouldn't believe that because the company would say who comes under the bargaining unit. Now, the company could have done it, but the union couldn't, 'cause the company could say, they could put the blacks in a position to say, "That does not come under the bargaining unit." But the union would have to try and organize everyone that comes under the bargaining unit. The union could never do this.
MG: So you never encountered anything with the union excluding the workers by race?
ME: No. Now, the only way that could have been done is by the company not acknowledging these people. Because you must remember, the union wants to organize as many as possible. Companies have a way of excluding certain people, you know, but these are supposed to be people that... elites, who look down on unions, and they'll say they're not a part of the bargaining unit. I'm more than sure they didn't do that with blacks, and I don't think that ever happened. Now, maybe what you're talking about, blacks very rarely were up in policy-making positions, and in a position such as mine in the union, but not being excluded from the bargaining unit.
MG: All right. Now are we talking in your perception just about the IUE and its policies, or other unions as well?﻿10
ME: I think that goes for the total union picture, 'cause that's the
only way that anyone could be excluded, is that the employer exclude them from the bargaining unit.
MG: You were actively involved in union activities during the rise of some of the most prominent black labor leaders, such as A. Philip Randolph. What are your memories, what was your perception.of Mr. Randolph and the role that he played?
ME: Mr. Randolph was a great role model for black people that wanted to get ahead, through whatever vehicle they could. Mr. Randolph chose the labor movement, and that was a wonderful role model for me, and it happened for me. The only thing that Mr. Randolph was—that I'm not— is so soft-spoken. But he was a determined person, and what he believed in, he worked for, and every bit of it was for the good of mankind, not just blacks. But of course, the blacks reaped the most benefit because the whites already had what Mr. Randolph was working for. But he was the best role model that any...mainly black people had, as the labor movement is concerned.
MG: Do you remember that time—I'm sure you do—of his threatened march
on Washington? What were your feelings about that? This was in 1941.
ME: Well, you mean my...
MG: Yes. What do you remember thinking at that time, that you would participate in the march, as a good tactical move...
ME: That's a good move, that's a good tactical move, yes. Yes, it was.
MG: And what was then the reception of Roosevelt's executive order 8802 that sort of really staved off this march? Was there a lot of optimism about what it would mean for blacks and employment?
ME: No. Well, it was not... But it meant that they weren't going to have to deal with Mr. Randolph, on the surface, as fair as could be, I would have to phrase it that way. But that's what it meant. Because, you know, we've known deep down inside that they were not going to deal with us fair all the way, because even through all Dr. King's struggle, we knew we were moving, but not as you...not even as he hoped for us to move. But we've moved.
MG: Mrs. Eberhardt, let me ask you now for your perceptions of Cleveland Robinson, who was president of the Negro American Labor Council.
ME: I was a member of that Negro Labor Council... Cleveland, I don't know too, too much about Cleveland. I was a member of that labor council, but by them having meetings in New York, and at that time I was not a driver, so I didn't make many of the meetings, but Cleveland was close to Mr. Randolph, so he had to be a good guy.
MG: ME:
How about the two biggest names, I guess we think of with the AFL-CIO, Walter Reuther and then George Meany?
Walter Reuther was a great guy. Walter Reuther was a great guy. It﻿11
ME: (cont) hurt me bad when Walter quit the AF of L-CIO, when he pulled out of the AF of L-CIO, because Walter had the guts to stand up to Mr. Meany, you know. The only thing, he just didn't get enough support from the rest of the board members. But if Walter was sitting in Mr. Meany's spot, the labor movement would be a better organization than it is today.
MG:	You think he's a more progressive...
ME:	Absolutely.
MG:	So what do you have to say about Mr. Meany?
ME:	Well, I can say that 1 God bless Mr. Meany that he's retiring. [laughter]
MG: Okay. Now I don't know if this was made clear early on or not. The IUE was made part of the AFL, right?
ME: No. The IUE was part of the CIO.
MG: CIO, okay. So when the merger came 1955, what kind of effect did that have on...
ME: Well, it had a great effect on us, but it was nothing we could do.
We could have held out, I guess, but we would have wound up being what you call a rump organization, because the AF of L was larger than we were, and for the sake of unity, I guess we had to go along with...'cause you can't spell union without U-N-I, you know that. And we had no other choice. But that was heartbreaking.
MG: You felt that your representation would somehow be less, that you were being absorbed in some way?
ME: We were being absorbed. We were. Because, now, at that time—I'm trying to...1955...
MG: Nineteen fifty-five was the merger.
ME: Yes, I'm trying to think when... No, I hadn't gone to the Industrial Union Council. But that's true, all the AF of L guys got the big spots. The CIO got what came after. So you can feel for yourself what position it put us in.
MG: There'll probably be some points here about this aspect of your career that we'll want to come back to as we speak on other subjects. Let me ask you just a little bit now about your involvement in Democratic Party politics.
ME: Well, I've been very much involved in Democratic politics. I was a delegate to the national convention for McGovern, but I got sick and never got there. I've always been involved in Democratic politics, and you can't say it was my upbringing, because I was raised in the South, and my father always voted Republican. I don't know whether he had to do it, or what, but he did, you know. He had to pay poll taxes in order to vote. But it instilled one thing in me, that a vote﻿12
ME: (cont) was important, 'cause my father would pay that tax in order to vote- But when I came North and got involved in the labor movement, now that's when I could see the difference in the two parties, and I guess that's why I've been a Democrat all my voting life.
MG: Now how about community activities. As if you didn't have enough to do! You're involved in a number of community organizations.
ME: Still am.
MG: The New Jersey Community Union and the Tri-Cities Union for Progress, are two of the ones I know about.
ME: Is that the North Jersey Community Union, isn't it?
MG: North Jersey. Right. I'm sorry. Could you say just a little bit about both of these groups?
ME: Well now, the North Jersey Community Union, I am the president of the board of directors there, you know. Any federally funded program has to have a board of directors, and I'm president of that, and that's a grand organization. They do wonderful things. It's housed in the central ward here in Newark. And if you know anything about Newark, the central ward is the worst there is. But the North Jersey Community Union sees to it that working mothers can go to work, and they have a day care center there for the children, they give them two hot meals a day; senior citizens, they give them four hours of work, those of them that are working material; and they give all kinds of health care to the poor in that ward. They even reach out in other parts of Newark, but it's supposed to be restricted to Newark.
The North Jersey Community Union came into being from an idea that I had in my head, because the average union member has health insurance. I don't think there are any unions around that don't carry health insurance, but only for union members. But the guy that's not working, what does he have? So something needed to be done for him, and I went to Dr. Levine, and told him that I had this idea in my mind. I said, "I don't know how to put it into action, but I would hope that something could be done for that poor working...poor nonworking mother and child and guy out there..." So he said to me, he thought they were doing something like that in Watts, California. And the IUC, which is the Industrial Union Council, sent me to Watts, California, and the UAV sent a fellow by the name of Ralph Hogan along with me out there, to look at what they were doing in the project out there, and to see if this is what we were talking about, and we'd get some ideas.
They were doing a wonderful job out there, but it wasn't what I was talking about. They were getting that bad youngster off the street and giving him something to do, making him feel like he was somebody, and that he didn't have to steal and do all these kinds of bad things in order to survive. This was very, very good. And this was sponsored by UAW, but this wasn't what I was talking about. I was thinking about that sick person, with the cost of health care; this was bothering me greatly.﻿13
ME: (cont) I came back and I told them I liked what I saw, but it
still wasn't what I wanted. So Dr. Levine called Jack Conway in the UAW and, oh, my goodness, a couple of other fellows, but I can't call their names. I think one of them was Woody Ginsburg...He called some of them together and Joel Jacobson from the IUC, 'cause Joel was president then of the IUC, and we sat down and we came up with a program to start the North Jersey Community Union. The first directors that we had didn't pan out so good, but when we got this fellow in there, Ken Peterson, he had a fantastic head on his shoulders, and he really put it to working. You really should see how that place is operating. We are using the old Kruger building. The city of Newark won't give us that building, so that we can refurbish it— we're doing it ourselves, from donations, and we even have the Teamsters helping us build that place up like it ought to be. And we hired doctors and nurses...
MG:	Does it receive federal funding?
ME:	Yes.
MG:	And does the union underwrite part of the cost, as well, or is it all...
ME:	They did from the beginning, but now we're strictly funded by HEW.
MG: Tell me something about this rehabilitation project of homes in Newark, East Orange and...
ME: The Tri-Cities Union?
MG: Yes, the Tri-Cities Union for Progress.
ME: Well, they have a place here, they call it Amity Village, and they're old dilapidated homes that have been rebuilt for low-income people. And that's federally funded also.
MG: Now, tell me this, these positions that we've just talked about, your political involvement, and your work with the community organizations, are volunteer, are they not?
ME: Yes.
MG: Why has a woman who has been so busy with salaried employment, still been able to find time to do this amount of volunteer service?
ME: Because my service is needed. You see, you can't just take anybody and put 'em on a board and be approved by HEW or...You got to get somebody with some type of background of involvement with people. Now the North Jersey Community Union, as I told you, was an idea of my own, so I wanted to stay with that, and I'm still even—being retired— on that board. Tri-Cities, I'm not too active with them now, because of my retirement. But I feel that I'm needed in these places, and I just go...I'm a dreamer, and so wherever I can go and try and make some of my dreams come true, I'm there.
MG:
Now, do you think that all these areas of your career are separate﻿14
MG: (cont) and distinct in your mind, or are they integrated, are they blended in some way...
HE: They're blended.
MG: ...that might not seem apparent?
ME: I think they're blended. Because now, you take my job as a—whatever you want to call it, civil rights or human relations or social action-it dealt with people, underprivileged people, you know? My job was to work for those people, to see that they get their just—not as far as their union dues, but because they were working people, and we represent them. Well now, when I go into something like North Jersey, this is people; Tri-City, this is people. They need me. So I think they're related.
MG: Did you consider being a wife and a mother another career as well?
ME: Well, I've been a mother for forty-one years, but I wasn't a wife too long. [laughs]
MG: We'll get to that, okay? What do you think, Mrs. Eberhardt, is the purpose of work? That is, what is work for?
ME: Well, work is...I don't know what you want me to say, because you
work because you have to work, and you work... Well, my job with the IUE was an enjoyment for me, and of course it was a way of survival also. But it really was because I was doing things I wanted to do, because I love people, and you know, when the civil rights movement got so apparent, and they would talk about how black children came up and underpriv...I didn't have problems. My father always worked. I never knew my father not to have a job. I never had a fancy life, but I had a living. We always had a roof over our heads, we always had food, and we were made to go to school. So, but then when you hear these things, and you see some of it, I think it sort of touches you. And the fact of the matter that I have such a big mouth, I think I can talk for the underprivileged people, you know? Moxie, I can have, money...
MG: You were saying that you had moxie, but not money. Have you tried to measure your career against some standard of achievement, and if so, what standard would that be?
ME: Well, to be truthful, I have never measured it. I just see things
I would like done, and try and achieve it through some type of vehicle.
MG: What are your current projects?
ME: Well, the only project is that last project, and the one that I'm working on now is Black Women United.
MG: Black Women United? What is that?﻿15
ME: Well, that's just a group of women uniting themselves around issues and collectively trying to do something about it.
MG: Do you consider yourselves a feminist organization?
ME: So to speak, you could say. That doesn't mean that we discriminate against men, but I feel that we as black women should have some type of organization on our own. Most of the organizations that I've been a part of have been both black and white, and usually it's the white word that goes furthest, if you be honest. And I'm a little bit tired of that, you know? I feel that we're intelligent enough to speak for ourselves, provided we unite ourselves. So that's what I'm trying to do now.
MG: Are you doing this locally in Newark?
ME: In New Jersey. The whole state of New Jersey. I'm trying to organize at least one thousand black women—political purposes and the like, because that's a hell of a lot of clout. If you've got a thousand black women, you can almost say you've got a thousand families, as far as voting on the issues and things. And we need that kind of thing. And I guess we'll get to it later because then I'll tell you about these things.
MG: Yes. Let me just ask you one thing here. What's the mechanism that you're using for organization? Are you going through the unions, through church groups, what are you doing?
ME: No. We just have a committee set up that's called the Organizing
Committee, and they in turn just talk to women when they're in their groups or homes or families—just spread the word that we're trying to organize this organization. As a matter of fact, we've been organized. We're just growing now.
MG: When did you start?
ME: We started right here in this house two years ago, two years January past.
MG: Now let's move on to another topic. What was the nature of your formal education?
ME: Well, I only went to high school.
MG: Where was this?
ME: in Richmond, Virginia.
MG: Were there courses there that you particularly enjoyed, that you were good at early on?
ME: No. I just was a student because I had to go to school to live in my mother's house. [laughter]
MG: How about any of your teachers or classmates that stand out in your﻿16
MG:
(cont) memory? Was there anything significant during that time for you?
ME: Yes, one significant thing. I was in the sixth grade at this time,
and the teacher and I just didn't get along for some reason. We just couldn't get along. Well, I don't think I was the best student, I mean, I tried to learn, but I wasn't the teacher's pet, let's put it that way. I failed that sixth grade; and, well, my mother, I don't know, she just...she didn't allow you to fail, and this was a big deal. I had said I'd never do that with my child, but thank God I didn't have to. My punishment would have been all your recreation would have been taken from you for the whole summer. That's the kind of mother I had. To keep her from doing that, I told her that I would go to summer school, and I would pass, and she said, "Well, how can you do in eight weeks what you couldn't..." But I promised.
The first day of school...I had a man teacher, Mr. Morton, I'll never forget him, and I told Mr. Morton what Miss Johnson had done, and why I thought...Well, that meant what I was wanting from Mr. Morton, for him to really work with me, and he did just that. He worked with me, you know, if I wanted to stay later—you know, in some schools, you only work for four hours, but I could stay later, and he would help me. And I passed the sixth grade. That stands out in my mind.
MG: Yes. Well, it's very clear that your parents thought education was important. What did they tell you about education, what were their views on education?
ME: Oh, I'm not going to tell you. [laughs] My mother used to be so
blunt as... God love her, I don't think she really meant the things she said, but she would—oh, my mother would give a dummy the worst name there was. I had an older sister that got nothing but A's all the time. But she would want to race, either with a cousin of ours or somebody in her class. She would be determined, and I would be rooting for Ann, instead of paying attention to me. And I would come home with the C's, and oh, the punishments. My mother said one thing to me, but she apologized later. "You'll never be anything because you don't want to learn." I wanted to learn, but books weren't my whole thing. My older sister, books were her whole thing. We had lamplight, and at a certain time at night, my mother would turn the lights low, 'cause it's bedtime. If Ann wasn't finished her homework, Ann would be under that light...and I would say, "Well, she put the lights out, so I don't have to study." [laughter] And that kind of thing. My mother would say, "Ah, you'll never..." When I got the assignment to go to Europe with my job, my mother said, "If your father was living, we would have to look at each other and say, 'We never would have thought...'" But I had a determined mind. But in retrospect, I wish I had paid more attention to the books like she said.
MG:	But at the time, that really didn't appeal to you, that kind of learning?
ME:	it didn't.
MG:	When did you go to Europe? Was that with the union?
ME:	Yes. Yes, I was a delegate to the, to the... I met the group in﻿17
ME: (cont) Amsterdam first, and we stayed there a few days, then we
went on to Zurich for the conference, and then from Zurich we went to Rome.
MG: Well, maybe you'll find the time and you can add it to the transcript. The year. Well, let's talk some about your parents now. What was your father's name?
ME: Randolph Graves.
MG: Where was he born and do you know when?
ME: No, I really don't know what year my father was born, to tell you the truth. But they were all born in Virginia.
MG:	In the Richmond area?
ME:	Yes.
MG:	Did you know your paternal grandparents?
ME:	Only my grandfather, my mother's father.
MG:	But your father's people, you didn't...
ME:	They had died before my mother and father married.
MG:	How about your mother's name?
ME:	Ida.
MG:	What was her maiden name?
ME:	Kenny.
MG:	And she was also born in Virginia? What was your maternal grandfather's name?
ME:	Edmund Kenny. That's K-E-N-N-Y.
MG:	So this is a long line, then, of ancestors from Virginia, is that right?
ME:	Yes. My grandfather was a child slave.
MG:	Did you hear him talk of...
ME:	Yes. He was a child slave.
MG:	When did your father die?
ME:	Let me see now. I was...
MG:	Yes, we can figure it out that way.﻿18
ME: We can figure it out that way. I was eighteen, and I'm sixty-four now.
MG: That was '33, 1933. Do you remember how old he was at the time?
ME: Fifty-six.
MG: And is your mother still living?
ME: No.
MG: No? When did she die?
ME: She passed in 1970.
MG: How old was she?
ME: She was seventy-three.
MG: How would you characterize your father? What sort of man was he? How do you remember him?
ME: He was a great man. Oh my, I had a father! He was so good. He
loved his wife and his children. My mother was very, very strict. She was a good mother, but very strict. At times, she and my father would have cross words—never an argument, 'cause he wouldn't argue with her. But she would be after him for not punishing us enough. The neighbors could say that we did something that they didn't like, and my mother would punish us for it, and my father didn't like that. He did not like that. He would always say to us, if you would ask him about certain things, "It's all right with me, but you've got to please your mother." And I would say to my older sister, "Well, that means no." [laughter] See, that's the trouble I got myself in. But he was a good father, good husband. My mother never asked my father for anything that he didn't try to give it to her.
He used to work at the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, and he used to get paid every two weeks. And he also was a musician, and he used to sing in a quartet—they used to call it Pork Miller's Old South Quartet in the South. But then, my father used to play a guitar, and he used to play if somebody had a banquet at a hotel or something, you know, this was extra money. I sit right there where you're sitting, I'd be paying bills, and I often think of my father, and I say, "Well, I can't pay that because of..." My father used to make a list of what he could pay, and my mother would like be standing ironing or something and looking over at this list—this isn't significant to that, but I... He would always put her at the top of the list, you see, give her a certain amount of money. And when he'd get down to the bottom, he'd add, and, well...
MG: Take some off of everybody's.
ME: So he did, he erased them... And Mama would be ironing, looking, and he'd get down, he's still gotta go back up, and he'd... And she would﻿19
ME: (cont) say, "Don't touch me, not another drop." He'd say, "No, Miz Graves, no, Miz Graves, not going to touch you." [laughter] But you see, then he would try and get a few engagements to play music. See, he worked nights at the engagements to make up the extra money. So he was a great man.
MG:	How do you remember your mother?
ME: Mama was a very good, strict mother.
MG:	Did she ever have any income-producing employment outside the home?
ME: No.
MG:	She stayed home the whole time?
ME:	That's when they would have quarrels. When she would get argumen-
tative, I'd see my father reach up and take his hat—he never went any place without his hat—and he would walk out. And he come back, he'd say, "Feel better, Miz Graves?" Oh, if I could hear him now.
MG:	He called her Grace?
ME:	Miz Graves.
MG:	Miz Graves. Oh, Graves. I see.
ME:	"Feel better, Miz Graves?"
MG:	Why did she want to work? She just wanted to increase the income,
or was there some other reason she wanted to?
ME:	I guess she felt she wanted certain things. Mama was quite indepen-
dent. I guess she hated to go to my father for everything she wanted.
MG:	What were his reasons for not letting her work?
ME:	Well, he figured she had her hands full—there were eight of us—with
the children, and she did.
MG:	Now, you were born, then, in Richmond, 1915, the 31st of August?
And there were seven other children besides yourself in the family. Can you tell me the names of all your siblings? Maybe, if you can, you can give them to me in order.
ME: My sisters and brothers? Of course. My oldest sister was Martha
Ann. She was called Ann, but I've got to remember to call her by her right name.
MG:	Is she married?
ME:	She's deceased.
MG:	She's deceased. All right. What was her married name?﻿20
ME:	She didn't marry.
MG:	Oh, she didn't marry. Okay.
ME:	She was twenty-six when she died. Then the next was me. Do you
want my maiden...the whole thing?
MG:	I got it. Mae Graves Massie Eberhardt. [laughter]
ME:	And then was my oldest brother.
MG:	What was his name?
ME:	Randolph.
MG:	He was named for your father? Is he still living?
ME:	Deceased. And the next brother, William.
MG:	Is he living?
ME:	My brother Randolph and he died within eleven months. Then Susie, Jeanette, Julia, Hattie.
MG:	Now, your younger sisters, starting with Susie, do they have married
names?
ME:	Jeanette has a married name. Susie has a married name, Susie is
Jenkins.
MG:	And Jeanette...
ME:	...is White. Jeanette's still in Richmond, Virginia. Hattie doesn't
have a married name. Julia's deceased, and Hattie's still Graves.
MG:	Where does she live?
ME:	in East Orange.
MG:	What was the atmosphere, what was the environment of the home in
which you grew up?
ME:	Well, it was a pleasant environment.
MG:	You remember certain set daily routines as a child, things that all
of you had to do? How was the house ordered?
ME: Well, we all had chores to do every day. And you went to school. You had no night life—that was out.
MG:	Was that to keep you serious and sober?
ME:	That's right, that's right. Well, that's the way my mother ran a house.
Did you perceive that you had a certain role in the family as children,﻿21
MG:	(cont) things that were yours particularly to carry out or to do?
ME:	Well, the oldest ones had to look after the younger ones. You had
that responsibility.
MG: Was there just one of the younger children you had to particularly care for, or did you sort of have to look out for everybody?
ME:	We had to start, Ann and I had to start from William on down, and
he was the... [laughs] Yes, every Sunday we had to take them to Sunday school, and one time William didn't want to go, and we had to tie him on our hand, because he had to go. He used to make us carry him, and we'd come home and we'd tell Mother, and the next time she'd tell him what was going to happen, and he would start that again. 'Cause he would just stop and wouldn't walk.
MG:	Just didn't want to go.
ME:	I said, "Leave him there. Let's go." Ann was older, but she was
a tiny little thing; she would go back and struggle with him, and I couldn't see her struggle with him. And this particular Sunday we were going home, and he got in a fight with her. I walked him right in that door. We didn't plan to carry him any more.
MG:	What do you remember about your family within your neighborhood? Did
you have a lot of visiting back and forth between friends or entertaining in the home or...
ME:	No. We didn't have... The neighbors were close, you know, the houses
were close together, and they would from time to time have conversations outside...all the women around the vegetable wagon, and things of that nature. But we never did a lot of entertaining in the home.
MG:	So most of your special occasions and celebrations were within the
family?
ME:	Within the family.
MG:	What was the impact of your father's death—not just psychologically,
but did it have a material impact on the family, too? You were still a young woman at that time.
ME:
Right, and my mother had younger children.
MG:	What happened?
ME:	Then my mother had to go to work. And it was hard on my mother,
because you see, my mother didn't know how to do anything as far as running the home, 'cause my father did it all.
MG:	This is paying bills and...
ME: Yes.
MG:	...caring for the house and the rest of it?﻿22
ME:	But she had all that to do, so my sister Ann and myself, our role
was to help her. Not financially, so to speak—we did what we could that way also—but we had to help her, you know, make sure that the gas and electric was paid, because at this time, now, we had moved up in the world now. We didn't have lamps anymore. And we would assist her as best we could with the younger ones. My duty was to see that the younger girls were dressed right, their hair combed, and the right, proper clothes to wear to school, go to the graduation, and that kind of thing.
MG:	What work did she find outside the home?
ME:	She went to work in the bank. She didn't go where my father was,
the Federal Reserve. Mama went in the... What's the name of that bank? Franklin Trust, I think it was, I'm not too sure. But that was in Richmond. She went to work in the bank as the supervisor over the custodians.
MG:	What did your father do in the bank? I don't think I asked you.
ME:	He was a janitor, he did janitorial service.
MG:	But he worked during the day?
ME: Nights.
MG:	Nights. Who would you say were your role models as you were growing
up? Who did you sort of admire and want to imitate, or were you conscious of that at all?
ME:	I just wanted to be me, 'cause I think I have a great mind, thank
God for it. But I just always wanted to be me, and that's why I got the name of stubborn.
MG:	So you weren't particularly envious, then, of other people, nor did
you necessarily want to be like them. You were self-assured?
ME: Right.
MG:	Were there other members of your family around you, aunts or uncles
or cousins, that you had contact with?
ME:	Yes.
MG:	Which ones?
ME:	My mother's sister, she was a lovely person, too. She was very good to us.
MG:	What was her name?
ME:	Her name was Martha Ann Fox. My sister was named for her.
MG:	How old were you when you left home, when you left Richmond, and﻿23
MG:	(cont) how did it come about?
ME:	I got married at an early age, and my husband had a brother in New
Jersey, and his brother told him he could find work for him, you know, making more money than he was making in Richmond, and we came to Orange, New Jersey, for that reason.
MG:	This was Mr. Massie?
ME:	No, this was Mr. Brown.
MG: Mr. Brown.
ME:	I was married three times.
MG: Well, I'll come back to that. Has religion been an important force in your life?
ME:	Well, I think I'm a religious person—I mean I believe in God, if
that's what you mean. Yes. Well, we were brought up that way.
MG: Which church were you members of?
ME:	In Richmond? In Richmond, we were members of Sixth Mount Zion.
Now, that's a church that my mother's great-grandfather had to build, and his name was John Jasper, and he's the one that preached the Sunday... Now his name is in some of the history books somewhere.
MG:	Let me take that down. What was his name again?
ME:	John Jasper.
MG:	And he was your mother's...
ME:	Great-grandfather. And he helped to build that church.
MG:	Sixth Mount Zion?
ME:	Yes, because when the new highway went through Richmond, you know, that church was left standing because of the historical importance.
MG:	Do you remember about what time it was established? That must have been...
ME:	Oh, I wouldn't know.
MG:	That was some time in the nineteenth century.
ME:	It would have had to have been.
MG:	What denomination was it?
ME:	It was a Baptist church.
MG:	Now, what I was getting at, asking you about religion, is to try and see﻿24
MG:	(cont) from your viewpoint, in the whole scheme of things in your
life, if you would consider yourself a very religious person, or if it's just a part of your life but not maybe a focal...
ME:	It's only part of my life, 'cause I'm... That's what I'm trying to
get that lady for that morning to do some work for the church.
MG:	Are you still affiliated with the Baptists here?
ME:	No, there's a Methodist church...
MG:	Now, in terms of what came later in your life, your work, your
involvement with the union, your volunteer activities, your political activities, was there anything along the way as you were growing up—local events, national events—that you think had some impact upon your thinking as a young woman? Something that kind of stayed with you and acted as a spur to later activity?
ME:	Well, my work in the church led me to know that I had leadership
ability, 'cause I was very active in Saint Matthew's A.M.E. Church here. Before I went into the union.
MG:	So that was kind of a training ground for...
ME:	Yes. It was.
MG: You learned to speak, appear before groups...
ME:	Before groups, yes, because I was president of the usher corps of
the church for years. I've been very active in this church.
MG:	How about, now, you were a teenager and a young adult in the thirties,
during the depression. Do you remember especially hard times then?
ME:	There again, we didn't have such a hard time. My father worked.
The banks closed with his few little pennies in there, but he worked.
MG:	So it wasn't fancy, but it got you through.
ME:	Got me through, yes. I don't remember how we did it, but I thank
God.
MG:	Mrs. Eberhardt, you mentioned that it was when you married your first
husband that you moved to New Jersey. What time was this?
ME: This was in...the war was 19...
MG: Forty-one, '42, '43, through that period?
ME:	Through that period.
MG:	Second World War period, then, you moved to New Jersey. What was
your husband's first name? Mr. Brown?
ME: Nathaniel.﻿25
MG:	Could you tell me a little bit about him? Just whatever you want
to say about the kind of man he was and so on.
ME: Well, he was a man that didn't want anything out of life. He's now deceased, but he never wanted anything out of life, and I couldn't tell him anything.
MG:	You had more ambition, wanted more?
ME:	Yes.
MG:	And then you married Mr. Massie. What was his first name?
ME:	Arthur.
MG:	Could you say something about him?
ME:^ Well, Arthur was a hard-working man, but he had an alcoholic problem, and I couldn't deal with that. But he was good, except for that alcoholic ... and I tried to deal with it, but I just couldn't.
MG:	Was he from this area, was he from New Jersey?
ME:	I met him in New Jersey.
MG:	I meant to ask you about Mr. Brown, too. Was he from Virginia?
ME:	Richmond, Virginia.
MG:	And then your husband, Mr. Eberhardt, William Eberhardt. You met him
through the union, through union activities?
ME:	I met him when I went to Kuthe Laboratory to work.
MG:	What would you like to say about him?
ME:	Biggest mistake of my life, that's all I can say.
MG:	All right. Now, you have one child, a daughter. What is her name?
ME:	Clementine.
MG:	How old is she?
ME:	Forty-one.
MG:	So she's the child of your first marriage.
ME:	Yes.
MG:	Does she live here in New Jersey?
ME:	Yes, she lives in New Jersey.﻿26
MG:	What would you like to say about her?
ME:	No mother could be blessed with a better child. She was an A student
in school, she loved to study, she just was a good child. I don't know anything I could say. She's never disappointed me once.
MG:	Does she have children? Do you have grandchildren?
ME:	One grandson.
MG:	What's his name?
ME: Robert.
MG:	I didn't ask you Clementine's married name.
ME: Harris.
MG:	Now, let me ask you this, and I'd like you to answer from more than
just your personal experience. How do you feel about the institution of marriage?
ME:	I love the institution of marriage. I think that has been one of
my problems because of my feeling toward the institution of marriage. I think I delved into marriage maybe a little too fast, because I have a lot of respect for the institution. I think it's the thing, I think that this is the way it ought to be. But by the same token, I don't degrade anyone that thinks otherwise, but I do.
MG:	But for yourself.
ME:	But for me, it is for me.
MG:	Let me ask you about friendship, too. Have you had a lot of close
friends as you were growing up and throughout your life, or do you think you would characterize yourself more as a loner, or what?
ME:	I have one good girlfriend that we've been friends from young girls
up, from Richmond, Virginia. She's now living in the Bronx, New York, but we've been friends just about all of our lives.
MG: What is her name?
ME:	Her name is Virginia Henderson.
MG:	Has friendship been important to you?
ME: It has.
MG:	Did you feel that there was ever any tension between you and your
husbands and your work?
ME:	I think there was jealousy between Eberhardt and my work.
MG:	Was there some feeling, do you think, on his part that your role﻿27
MG:
(cont) should be more domestic, less public?
ME:	No, I don't think that. I think he felt that I was above him,
because of my position in the union. You must realize that I went right on up the ladder in the union. The way I thought I could deal with it—I'm thinking now, and maybe it was the wrong way— because then I pushed for him to get employment in the union, and I don't think that should have been.
MG:
MG:
ME:
MG:
Did you ever feel any tension yourself between your private and your public life?
ME: No.
Did you feel that somehow there was something drawing you home, or there was something drawing you outside the home, or did you just resolve it all in some way?
I resolved it all. Part of my working life, I had my grandchild to raise, 'cause Clementine was in California, but I had wonderful neighbors as baby sitters, and so I had no problem.
Do you think that your daughter ever resented your public life?
ME:	No, she never resented it.
MG: Well, let's move on now. Let me ask you some questions about race. Do you have any preference among the terms colored, Negro, black?
ME:	I don't have a preference, but I like the term black, because I
think it brought us as a race closer together to understand each other better. When I was a youngster coming up, it made a difference what color you were. If you were of my complexion, then you didn't get the benefits even in school as a person your complexion, where I was brought up. And I found that even here in New Jersey, you know.
MG:	Did you think that was uniform? I mean, that really, if you were
brown-skinned, it made a difference everywhere, in every...
ME:	Yes. I really do. But when we started the term black, why then all
people of color started pronouncing themselves as one, and working as one. It wasn't always that way, and I like that very much because even my mother had a slight resentment toward my girlfriend—the one I told you, in Virginia—because Virginia was like of your complexion, and me being my complexion. But I never felt that should make a difference, because no one—I've always known this, from a very young person-no one is responsible for their color. And if you love a person, you just love them; if you like 'em, you just like them.
MG:	Did you ever think that there was any difference in the degree of
racial consciousness, an identity with the race, based on color?
ME:	Yes. For some of the same reasons that I just said to you. I felt
there was a difference.
MG:	Did you think that brown-skinned people more identified with the race﻿28
MG:	(cont) than lighter skin or...
ME:	Brown-skinned people more identified with the race. Well, you can
even see it now, because when they start equal opportunities— employers—just look around you and see what you see. For instance, let's take New Jersey Bell, when they put in equal opportunity, you went in their office, you found the darkest person you could find sitting up there at a desk, to prove we're equal opportunity employers. Because maybe if you were sitting over in the corner and they looked very fast, they would still say that that's a white woman over there.
MG:	I know what you're saying.
ME:	They wanted to make sure that they were called equal opportunity
employers, so they reached out for the darkest. This is very true.
MG:	Well, what about what's going on inside the heads of those people,
those black people, along the whole color spectrum. Do you think that, say, fair-skinned black people tend to be less conscious, racially conscious, than darker skinned, or not?
ME:	Yes. I do, because, now before we started the term black, if you
said black to a, let's say, a brown-skinned person—'cause I call myself a black person or brown skin—well, you're heading for a fight. But now it's not that way.
MG:	Is there a generational difference there, then? Do you think that
some of those feelings might still carry over with men and women of your generation?
ME:	Of my generation, absolutely, absolutely. Because I have, she's not
a sister-in-law, but she went with my oldest brother for a long time, and she's not quite as fair as you, but almost, and she detests the term black, you see. And see, she's along with me. And you find that..
MG:	What do you perceive in younger people?
ME: Well, I think the younger people...black's black. They're all together, more so than we were when we were coming up* I really do.
MG:	You see that as a positive...
ME:	I really do.
MG:
What did your parents discuss with you regarding race when you were growing up?
ME:	It never was discussed. My father used to tell us stories, but they
were true. He would tell us what used to happen to him when they played, sang, all throughout the South. They had a quartet called Pork Miller's Old South Quartet that was known throughout the South. He would say that sometimes in their travel, they would, like, if they wanted to sit on a park bench if they were tired, they would look for the signs, 'cause the signs would say, "Niggers and dogs not﻿29
ME:	(cont) allowed," or something to that effect. But then my mother
would say to him, "Explain to them that this is not the way now, not that way now. They know where they can go, and that's where we want them to go." She was right in that respect, 'cause she didn't want that kind of rhetoric to rub off on us.
MG:	To inhibit your...
ME:	Right. I often speak of my mother as strict, but she was so right
in that kind of thinking. So color...race wasn't discussed in my home much, 'cause Mama wouldn't allow it.
MG:	Discussed in terms that might inhibit you or make you feel less than...
ME:	That you were less than the other. Mama always used to say, "You are
all God's children, regardless of the pigmentations of your skin; no one is any better than you." That's why she used to fuss so much about your education, you know. "Good God," he'd say, "they've got
a special spot for dummies." [laughter]
MG:	Now vrtiat about the stories that you heard from your Grandfather Kenny?
ME:	About slavery?
MG: Mm hmm.
ME:	Well, my grandfather had no quarrels with them because he said they
had good—what'd he call them—slave masters. And he was left to play with the white children his age. But he was a child. His mother was the slave, and he was a child.
MG:	And that was not for very long, in any case.
ME: No.
MG:	So his memories were not of conditions particularly harsh, as he
related them?
ME:	No, that's true.
MG:	Were there other discussions, discussions outside the home, of a
racial nature that you remember as a young person, that you were aware of?
ME:	No, because you know in Richmond, Virginia, you had the black school
...so we had no discussions.
MG:	That's what I was going to ask you. To what extent did you have con-
tact with whites when you were growing up?
ME:	We only met with that kind of discrimination if we went to Broad
Street shopping. My mother brought us up very independent. You want water, drink it before you leave. If you got to go to the bathroom, go before you leave, because downtown in the business section, you drank water out of black fountains, you went to black toilets, or whatever the case may be. And do you know, even today, I'm getting﻿30
ME:	(cont) dressed to go out to the market, I go to the bathroom before
I leave. Because she instilled it, and X did the same thing with my children. But of course, my child didn't have that problem.
MG:	So she wanted to simply spare you the indignity at all, if she could
do it.
ME:	Right. I think she just didn't want that kind of stuff preying on
our minds, that we can't go where we want to go, and she didn't want us to have that feeling, and we didn't.
MG:	How did you regard white people yourselves?
ME: Me as a youngster? I just regarded them as having the money, and I had to work in order to get it, and I resented it.
MG:	Yes. Were you aware of how they regarded you, how they regarded
black people?
ME:	As servants.
MG:	Do you think that their viewpoints affected your...
ME: Not at all.
MG:	...racial attitudes?
ME: Not at all.
MG:	What was the nature of the black community where you lived? Do
you remember them discussing in the neighborhood, things that had to do with race, incidents that may have occurred in Richmond while you were growing up?
ME: No.
MG:	What was the first time, then, in your life that you recall your racial
consciousness being significantly heightened?
ME:	First time? Never was, in Richmond. Oh, yes. I had one incident
in Richmond. I was going up into a town that they call West Hampton. That's where all the rich people live. And I had to go by trolley— at that time it wasn't bus, it was trolley. They had a rule in Richmond—this is my first real encounter with that—that if you got on the trolley as a black person, and an empty seat was in front of a white person, you're supposed to ask the white person to move to the front, so that you could always be sitting in back. And I got on the bus this morning, and I said to the white woman—it was a white woman, she had on some type of uniform, like she may have worked in a bakery or something, and I said, "Would you mind taking this seat in front," and she proceeded to look out the window. And I asked her a second time, and she looked out the window, and the third time, I sat down in the seat in front. She got up and she went to the trolley driver, and she said, "You have a nigger back there don't know where she belong." And the driver turned around to me and said, "Get on back﻿31
ME:	(cont) where you belong." I said, "I am already." And when he
turned to get out of his seat, there was quite a few black people in the back, they all stood up, were coming to the front, and he sat down and said, "Lady, find yourself a seat. Go home."
MG:	What time was this? What time period?
ME:	This was in the morning.
MG:	And how old were you at the time?
ME:	About fifteen, something like that.
MG:	So this was in the thirties, then. When you moved to Jersey, at the
time you came, there was still a lot of segregation in New Jersey. Beaches were segregated, and there were continuing fights in the courts about segregated schools; there'd been a major riot before you came to New Jersey—this was in 1926. So did you encounter anything of a racial nature in New Jersey that made a special impression upon you? I don't mean just the day-to-day stuff of living, but...
ME:	I didn't let it bother me. I had had, like I told you about with
Helen in Orange and Domestic. When I went to put Clementine into school, they had what you call a bonus. If you worked every day in the week, you got a bonus. If you missed a day, you lost your bonus. Well, I lost three hours that morning putting Clementine in school. When I got my pay, they had taken the three hours away, plus the bonus. So I said, "This is penalizing me twice for one thing." So I would go to Helen, who was the shop steward, 'cause I'm a firm believer in protocol, and I go to Helen and I tell her what happened.
She was supposed to take my envelope and go in and get it collected. She said to me, "Mae, the people around the union is white, and the people in there is white, those people are going to do whatever they want to do." Well, I x^ill not tell you what I said to her, but I said to her, "Do me one thing, give me the phone number for that office down there." And she gave me the phone number. Well, they tried to give me a runaround, you know, the union officials. But when they found out that I knew what I was talking about, they said to me, "Go in and tell Helen to tell them to give you your bonus. You'll lose your three hours, but they'll give you your bonus." And I go back and I tell Helen what they say. Helen goes in the office and I say, "I'm going to go in behind her and hear what she's saying, but I'm going to look like I need a new mark for some of the clothes I got." And I took this ticket and I go in, and I can hear Helen in there saying, "She said that they said..." That's the only encounter I had.
MG:	Now why do you think Helen felt so...
ME:	Well, Helen's belief was, whatever the white man said was right,
regardless.
MG:	Let me ask you some questions about racial integration. There are
different definitions of integration. Do you feel that integration is﻿32
MG: (cont) full and open access to public facilities, or do you feel
that it must also involve, necessarily involve, social contact between the races in such places as churches and neighborhoods, homes?
ME: You mean, do I think...
MG: Integration should involve simply equal access to employment, to all
kinds of public facilities, or do you think that it should also involve contact between blacks and whites and neighborhoods and churches...
ME: I think it should. Far as neighborhoods, I think wherever you can
afford to live, you ought to be allowed to live. If you want to worship, wherever the church is open, you ought to be able to go in and worship. Wherever there are hotels, and you need a room and you can afford to pay, you should be allowed. Yes, I really do.
MG: Do you think that black people have anything to lose through racial integration?
ME: I don't think so.
MG: Do you see any value in the preservation of any all-black institutions— let's say, black universities, black neighborhoods, black schools?
ME: Well, I do...have seen value in it. All right, I have seen a difference in children going to school in the South than in the North.
MG: In what ways?
ME: Because the children going to school in the South are further advanced, if you'd believe it. The children here are so busy fighting that sort of thing, you know, there's discriminatory acts and what have you, that they can't really concentrate. In the North they're passed, just to get out of the way, to make room for them, but in the South, no. Those schools, if you don't know, you don't pass. I see a difference, as far as the schools are concerned. I don't know how that would work in the North. Because the fact of the matter is, you've got all-black schools, and you've got all-black teachers.
MG: In the South.
ME: In the South. But in the North there is a difference.
MG: All-black schools, and lots of white teachers.
ME: Lots of white teachers, and there is a difference in the learning process. And you see, parents don't help it any either. Children will come home, and the first thing the parent will want to know when they tell them what the new teacher is, white or black. What difference does that make? I never did that with Clementine. Because I didn't want her to think there was a difference. She was a teacher, or he was a teacher. But in the North, you find that, and it makes a difference with the learning, with the kids' learning.
MG: How about in the family? Do you think that the black family should be﻿33
MG: (cont) all black, and that it should be preserved as such? Do you see integration extending that far?
ME: I see integration extending that far.
MG: Do you think there's any threat inherent in that kind of integration?
ME: I don't really think so.
MG: Do you perceive any generational differences in racial attitudes?
We talked about notions of color a bit earlier, but are there other ways that you think young black people tend to think about race that's different from the way older black people do?
ME: Yes, there is. See, older people—a lot of them, not all of them— had a fear; but the younger generation doesn't have a fear, as far as their race is concerned, I don't think.
MG: Do you think that for you personally race has been a factor in shaping your life?
ME: I don't think race had anything to do with the shaping of my life.
MG: Do you think that it has affected in any way the public response to your work—in other words, let's say, with your work with the union or with the Democratic Party? Has what you've done been perceived and received a certain way because of your being...
ME: In some instances, yes.
MG: In a negative or positive manner, or what?
ME: In some positive, and some negative, because I know one time Gloria
Johnson and myself were at Cornell University for some sort of seminar, and one woman said to me, "How does the IUE get black women right up at the top?" And I had to answer her truthfully, I said, "Not willingly. We had to fight for it." And I think in some instances, I've been looked at as the person because of where my standing is being black. But I don't let it touch me; inside, I have no... I don't let it bother me.
MG: What's your evaluation of the racial situation in the United States today?
ME: I think it's terrible.
MG: How? You know, in what ways?
ME: Well, you just look at your economic ladder. That tells you enough.
The unemployment among youngsters, black youngsters, black women and the like. I don't see where it's any better today than it was when I was coming around. If you didn't have the mechanism to get out there and fight for a thing, you didn't get it, and today, the same. I think it's even worse now.﻿34
MG: That's interesting, because you know, we hear so many people oftentimes described as black leaders—I'm not certain whether they are or not—but described that way, in any case, pointing us to how far we've come through the past, through the years...
ME: Well, where do you think...
MG: I've often wondered if our relationship to power as black people in the United States is any different than it ever was. I think we can see material changes to some extent, but are we any better off in regards to our ability to control our own destinies in this country?
ME: I don't think so. Honestly, I don't think we are as well off as
we have been, really, because so many doors are closed for one reason or the other. Could be automation or—you name it. And legislation is one thing, but you can't legislate a heart. You still got the same evil people around spreading this kind of thing. I don't think you're any better off.
MG: Is there any...
ME: I don't see where blacks have come such a long ways. Well, you've
got black people out there speaking out, and that's all they're doing. Speaking out...how much pride do you have? Take Jesse Jackson, for instance...learned man, well-spoken man. Where is he getting? No place. People did that forty years ago.
MG: What do you think might be a technique, an approach to dealing with the racial situation that black people haven't tried? Do you think there is anything they should do that they haven't done?
ME: Those of them that are not praying, better start. That is all.
MG: Do you see us as a group within this country entering a new accelerated period of stress, of deprivation? Things are getting worse?
ME: If the economy doesn't change, of course. I know you've heard as
well as I have that in 1980, the people are going to have to choose between heat and food. Is that getting any better?
MG:	Not to my way of thinking.
ME:	Things aren't getting any better. I really don't see any.
MG:	So you don't feel optimistic for the future?
ME:	I really don't.
MG:	Mrs. Eberhardt, what, in your opinion, is women's work?
ME:	Anything they feel they can do.
MG:	What are your feelings regarding the equality or the inequality of men and women?﻿35
ME:	I think they're qualified; I think they're qualified equally.
MG:	What's your opinion of the term Ms.?
ME:	It's okay. It doesn't bother me one way or the other, but it's okay.
MG:	So you wouldn't object if you were referred to as Ms. Eberhardt?
ME:	No.
MG:	Well, now let me ask you, what would you say the women's movement is? As you perceive it.
ME: The women's movement, I think we need to deal with what's in that resolution that we're trying hard to get passed.
MG: The ERA [Equal Rights Amendment].
ME: I think what the courts are doing, they're taking that and women are losing some of the rights that they had, that they had before. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not against a man having his equal rights, and his equal opportunity as well. But a lady called me a couple of months or so ago, and she had gone to a lawyer because she wanted a separation from her husband, and the lawyer told her that her husband would have to sign. She couldn't understand it. She said, "He didn't... But with the new laws, you can't get it unless he signs, and she called me and she was cussing at me, "You old ERA women..." And so she said, she wanted to know, couldn't you just forget it? I said no, you cannot do that. But what we could do and ought to do, we ought to be able to read that resolution in its entirety, and be able to insert or add to certain things that women don't want to lose, or should be able to do. For instance, if my husband and I separate now, and get a divorce. Now he's working and I'm not. But because I draw a fairly decent pension, the courts would overlook the fact that it was my money that paid down on this house and that I did that. They would overlook all that
and would say, "Equal—half him, half___" But before, I could prove
my case that he's not entitled to half. Some, yes, but not half. Now, I don't know whether this should be blamed on ERA or what, but it should be dealt with. So I'm not too keen on the women's movement right now. I think it should be a movement, but I do think it needs dressing up or down, one way or the other.
MG: Well, what you're talking about there has to do with property rights, and in some states there are community property laws, so...
ME: Yes, they have 'em here in New Jersey.
MG: ...so that when a couple marries, regardless of who...
ME: Has what...
MG: ...has what, they have equal portion of the estate. But I think the arguments have been, on the other hand, sometimes, when the woman has not worked outside the home, she's assumed the traditional role of wife, mother, she's stayed in the house for who knows how many years.﻿36
MG: (cont) At the conclusion of that time, it's entirely the court's discretion what actually is hers, because she has never purchased anything, she's never worked, you know. But you would say overall that you think that, in terms of legislation, the whole area needs to be restudied, reevaluated?
ME: I think it should be, I really do. I think if it was restudied,
maybe we wouldn't have as hard a time getting the other three states that we need. 'Cause they've got to be hung up on some parts of it.
MG: Now what—rather, how—in your opinion, is the women's movement
relevant or irrelevant to black people and to black women in particular?
ME: Well, I'll tell you, I don't think it's too relevant to black women. I really don't. Because there are a very few of us that are, want to be, are in any position to be co-owners or—what do they call themselves? Some type of executives, or whatever. Because I feel that the women's movement really got started within the middle-class white woman's back yard, and not the black woman's back yard. I really do.
MG: Do you think that black women have, as you perceive it, the same sort of drive to personal independence as white women?
ME: I don't. I really don't.
MG: How would you characterize what it is you think most black women want?
ME: Well, most black women want a decent way of living, a good husband,
yes, and if necessary, to work side by side with him to help him gain whatever they're trying to achieve, and a happy home. She doesn't want to be equal with her husband as far as his business is concerned and all that kind of thing. She merely wants a decent life, a family life. And whatever it takes, if he needs her help, I think the average black woman is willing. She's not grasping, like the white woman is. Now, I'm not saying all white women are this way, but those of them that you hear speak out, this is the way they're sounding. But I know I don't feel that way, and I think there's a lot of other black women who feel the same way.
MG: So do you think that the women's movement, as it appears to be
structured now, is beneficial, can be beneficial, or is it detrimental to black women and the interests of the race?
ME: As it stands now, I think it can be detrimental.
MG: To what extent has being a woman affected your career?
ME: None whatsoever.
MG: Do you think, again, as I asked you about race, that the public response to your work has been influenced in any way by the fact that you're a woman?
ME: Not the public, no.﻿37
MG: Maybe this is the point now to go back and ask you if there's anything else you want to add in this discussion about the black women's group that you're involved in organizing. What are their feelings, would you say, towards the women's movement?
ME: Well, their feeling really is—you see, with ERA, they have a feeling that there wasn't enough black woman input from... So therefore, if we have our own organization, we feel that we will be viable to speak for black women, because we are black women. Because the white women, they've got their agendas, as such, but we don't come under all those categories. So therefore, we have to have an organization that we can identify with.
MG: What do you feel will be the agenda, as the group evolves, of your organization? I can't remember the name—what was it?
ME: Black Women United.
MG: Black Women United.
ME: The agenda? Well, the agenda is dealing with black women's issues. And also we want to have political clout to be able to get certain legislation passed, and I don't mean abortion and all that crap. But I'm talking about things that are meaningful to black women.
MG: What would some of those things be? What do you talk about in your meetings?
ME: Well, no one specific thing, but for instance, if...Now, let's say
that if Black Women United had been formed before we started the ERA, then it would have been incumbent upon whichever women that got together and said, "We're gonna try to come up with the ERA," to petition Black Women United for input. But we don't have an organization, no one can petition us, right? And so I'm just trying to get our feet on solid ground so we can be reckoned with, as the old people used to say.
MG: Do you think that black women's concerns would be mainly economic in this area rather than social?
ME: Mostly economic. Sort of social issues, yes.
MG: You have some special views about how work and pay should be restructured in more equitable ways, ways that would benefit black women. Could you describe those for me, please?
ME: Not only black women—women, period. I have no qualms with the
title "women's job." It should be, and I'll tell you why I say this. Because now, there are a lot of women that are heads of households. For instance, Bell Telephone or PSG & E [Public Service Gas and Electric] have an opening for someone to climb the poles, and they pay them very good salaries. Now, here's a woman who needs a job, and she figures, "Well, I need that kind of money, so I'm going to apply for that job." I think it's ridiculous that she's got to quit the secretarial job and go take this job climbing poles in order to make enough﻿38
ME: (cont) money to take care of her family. Her job should pay the same pay that that pole-climbing job should pay. It should be a woman's job, but pay the wages that are equal to running your home. They wouldn't think of offering a man___ What do secretaries get today?
MG: Oh, I don't know. Not much.
ME: Let's say, a hundred and fifty dollars a week. They wouldn't think of offering a man that kind of pay. Don't offer it to the woman either!
MG: So you're arguing that the work is what is important, and that pay should be accorded along that basis.
ME: Absolutely. I don't think a woman should have to feel that in order for her to make enough money to raise her family, she's got to get out of here and do all these hard, menial jobs, climbing telephone poles, and digging ditches, and laying pipe, and that kind of thing. Women's pay needs to be raised, not jobs changed.
MG: In addition to what we've already talked about, Mrs. Eberhardt, are there other organizations, civil rights groups, professional groups, sororities, and so on, that you were involved with?
ME: I'm in with the North Urban Coalition, and they're dealing with
the Norfolk Insurance situation, and I volunteered to work with them on that board. I don't know what my involvement is really going to be. But I am going to work with them on it.
MG: You have a number of awards and honors all around the room here. Could you say, for the record, what they all are?
ME: Well, that top one over there and the shovel in back of you is community involvement that Muhammad Ali was involved in. We're trying to build some homes in the central ward called the Muhammad Ali Village, and Ali was here to dig the first shovel in. I got that for that kind of project. And this I got from the Newark City Council for being involved in that kind of thing. This one is...
MG: So that's the Newark City Council for the Ali...
ME: Yes. And the other one is from the Women's Affirmative Action—that's a group of women from the trade union movement. We call them WAF, but it's the women's affirmative action. And this one over here was when I retired from Local 485 of the IUE.
MG: Oh. Well, let's put the date in, now, when you retired. On September 16th, 1977.
ME: Yes.
MG: Good.
ME: And this over here is from the District 3 Women's Conference, and that
was headed by me. I don't know why I gave my own self an award. [laughter]﻿39
ME: (cont) And this over here is from the Social Actions and People's
Causes—that's from the district. They gave me that. This is from the international—they give out that kind of award every two years, and I've received two of them. One, I left in the district office when I retired, and the other one I brought home.
MG: This is the International IUE?
ME: Yes. That's for, I give out so many scholarships a year, you know?
I got that for working with people's children. And this one here, this is from the Industrial Union Council—that's from the IUC.
MG: Now, go back to the scholarships—you do this personally?
ME: No, I did this for the union. It was a part of my work. I went
to a conference once up in the Poconos. It was a civil rights conference, and they had taken the liberty to invite some college kids, and one of the kids sitting in front of me said, "My conception of the labor movement is that you're fat and forty and complacent." So a man who was sitting beside me said, "Why that little young..." I said, "Uh unh, we'd better listen to him, 'cause he's telling you his concept." So I left that conference wondering, what could I do so that college kids would have a better image of the labor movement? And I thought, if I could just give some scholarships.
But the union didn't have money to do this—my district didn't—so we had to put on a fundraising affair, we worked hard, my committee, we worked so hard to have this dance, and we wanted to give at least five hundred-dollar scholarships, and all we could squeeze out was three scholarships. But we were happy that we did that, and that began to grow each year, and now we give out nine in our district. I don't know how many districts are in the international, but the IUE is throughout the country, and every district in the IUE has a scholarship program now from that, and also the international, they give out ten. None give less than nine scholarships—some locals give scholarships—so it's a lot of scholarships being given under the banner of IUE because I had that idea then. I was glad the kid said that. You see, what it would mean, that these colleges are all over, and it's one time when the union is being browbeaten for some little kid to speak up and say, "Well, if it wasn't for the IUE..."
MG: That's right.
ME: ...and they wouldn't be...
MG: What about these awards over here?
ME: Yes. I got one of them for activities in the community... This one is Essex County College. This is for outstanding community services. And this one is to women in District 3, IUE.
MG: What does the district involve? What's the area?
ME: District 3 is the whole state of New Jersey and the whole state of New York.﻿40
MG: Good. We need to get that 011 the tape. Now, do you have any hobbies?
ME: Yes. Soap operas. [laughter] When I get a time to relax, but I'm always on the go.
MG: Now, we've mentioned some of the travel that you've done. Have you traveled in addition to that?
ME: Oh, I've traveled all over this country, and like I told you...
MG: And Europe.
ME: ...gone to Europe, for the union.
MG: Right. What has the travel meant to you, besides, obviously, the chance to see something else?
ME: Well, it meant an awful lot to me because I don't think, if I didn't have this job, I'd never have gotten the opportunity to do that much traveling.
MG: But did you see it as an educational process, too?
ME: Absolutely, absolutely.
MG: Well, I'm nearing now the end of what I had prepared to ask for you. I want to ask you a little bit about your perceptions of aging. As you grow older, do you feel that the priorities in your life, what you consider most important, has changed over the years?
ME: I don't think so. I really don't. I think I have the same ambitions about things now as I did when I was in my thirties. I don't have the energy that I had then, but [laughter] I still feel what I want to do.
MG: Do you feel that as you grow older, or as one grows older, they grow wiser?
ME: Not necessarily. Well, wise to the extent that you... Like, when
you want to look in retrospect and you'd say you would have done it differently or something of that nature, but I don't think you're any wiser. Because you're the same person, although you're older. And your thoughts are the same, but you have to maybe deal with them differently because of the age. But I don't think you're any wiser because you're older.
MG: What would you say, then, is important to you now?
ME: Well, important to me now, because I've had such a bad spell now with my health. Because if I hadn't had that problem, I would still be working.
MG: I think maybe we should just say briefly something about your health for the record.
ME: Yes. Because I'd still be working, because I knew when you are...﻿41
ME: (cont) if you were working for the IUE, you had to retire at sixty-five—it was compulsory retirement—so I put my age back six years so I could have at least worked till I was seventy-one. But old Mother Nature caught up with me, and I couldn't do it. I forgot what I was going to say.
MG: Well, you were just saying how your health has affected what you can...
ME: Yes, what I can do and what I can't. I would still be working if it wasn't for that.
MG: Well, let me ask you...
ME: You were asking me what do I want to see done now.
MG: Yes. What's most important to you?
ME: Well, of course, good health, naturally. And aside from your health, and a decent living, the thing uppermost in my mind now, is getting Black Women United on the move and on the map.
MG: As you look back, at this point, as you look back over your life and
all the things that you've done, you've seen, all the rest, what gives you the most satisfaction?
ME: The scholarship program.
MG: With the IUE.
ME: With the IUE. Because I've wished I'd just had some of the letters, the heartwarming letters that we get back from some of the kids that that little scholarship gave them an opportunity. 'Cause my feeling is, if a child wants to do, and you give him leeway, they'll do it. One of the first kids that got a scholarship from us, she went on through college, and then the last time I saw her, she was going for her master's, I think. She'd come out of school in the summertime— she'd work, like, in supermarkets at the cash register—so proud of the fact that she was going to college. And this made me feel...this is a warm feeling. I think that's the greatest achievement that I ever made. And the fact of the matter that it caught fire throughout the IUE, every district thinks this is the thing to do, and so do many locals. So you see how many kids we are feeding into? 'Cause education does play an important role. Although I thought my mother was overdoing it, but she was so right, and I was so wrong.
MG: Well, that's the last formal question that I had prepared for you.
Is there anything that you'd like to say, or any area that we have missed discussing that we should treat at this time?
ME: I don't think there is any area that we should. I was a little leery about this interview because, like I told you from the beginning, I'm not a speaker, I'm a doer. But you've made it so easy for me, and I will hope you can get that mumbo-jumbo together.
MG: Oh, I'm sure. Well, I want to thank you, Mrs. Eberhardt, for a very,﻿﻿MAE MASSIE EBERHARDT
