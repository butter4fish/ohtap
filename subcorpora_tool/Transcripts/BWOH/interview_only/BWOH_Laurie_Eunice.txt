Mrs. Laurie, where were you born, and if you don't mind telling, when?
Mrs. Eunice Rivers Laurie:
I was born in Early County, Georgia, on November 12, 1899.
Mrs. A. Lillian Thompson:
Mrs. Eunice Rivers Laurie:
Do you remember anything about your grandparents? If so, what can you tell me about them?
No, let me see. No, I don't know anything about them.
Mrs. A. Lillian Thompson:
Describe the family at the time you were born. That is, how many children? What was the economic status, what was that like?
Mrs. Eunice Rivers Laurie:
My father was a farmer. He also worked at the sawmill, too. There were two children older than I, but they died in infancy. So I was the first child to live. I had two sisters later on. But our family consisted of our mother and father and the three girls.
Mrs. A. Lillian Thompson: Mrs. Eunice Rivers Laurie:
Did your mother work?
On the farm. She did very little working on the farm. She was a tiny person, so she spent most of her time with the children. She would take us to the field and help pick﻿2
ERL: (cont.) cotton. She didn't do much work herself, but as far as she was concerned, we all went to the field to learn how to work.
ALT: Did you start school at age five?
ERL: Really and truly, I don't know how old I was, but I believe I was older
than five. In those days, schools lasted about three months in those areas. I don't remember my first experience in school, but I know that I was older than five. I must have been about six or seven years old, and maybe older than that.
ALT: What were the schools like then?
ERL: Oh, the schools were very poor at that time. I guess for that time it was very good. It was a one-teacher school. They were all conducted in the churches. There were no special buildings when I first started. We went
to church for school, and school lasted about three months.
ALT: You mentioned a one-teacher school. Describe exactly what that was.
ERL: The one-teacher school meant that there was only one teacher in the school, for all the classes. The teacher had to teach all the first-graders up to the sixth grade, or whatever it was. She had to do all the teaching. Arithmetic, English, and what have you.
ALT: Is there anything about school that you look back on and think of as having been significant? Is there anything that inspired you at that time, or was it just going to school?
ERL: No, it was just going to school with me, when I was at home. I went away to school early, away from home.
ALT: Was this before you finished the sixth grade?
ERL: After the sixth grade. My father decided that he wanted me to grow up in
a different environment. So he sent me to Fort Gaines, Georgia, to a church school, what they called a denominational school at that time. There I stayed for about four years.
ALT: Was this a boarding school?
ERL: Yes, this was a boarding school. So I have been in boarding school most of my life. Papa was very much concerned about his children and their future. People at home criticized him for sending me away so young.
ALT: How old were you?
ERL: I guess I was fourteen, twelve or thirteen years old. And he was criticized for sending me away from home so early. My mother died when I was about fifteen years old. And as I say, Papa had sent me away to school because he was determined that his children come up under a different environment. Although he was supposedly a very progressive farmer and although we never﻿3
ERL: (cont.) wanted for anything as children or as a family, he saw that in the future we would need more.
ALT: How much education did he have?
ERL: About fourth grade.
ALT: And yet there was something that inspired him to want the children to do better.
ERL: Yes.
ALT: Did your mother have anything to say about education?
ERL: As I remember, she wanted the best for her children. And she would always say to me, because there was a difference between my sister and myself, that she wanted me to do everything good and get a good education, so that I wouldn't have to work in the fields so hard. She never worked; she was tiny and not too healthy. We used to tease her all the time and say she played off on Papa, but she never worked much in the field. Sometimes when he would be ginning cotton or something like that, he would go to the gin, but she would go to the fields with the people who were picking. So that was about all the farming that she did.
But as I said before, we went to school for three months then. Papa's cousin was principal of the school in Fort Gaines, Georgia, that I attended, and that was where I got my inspiration. This school at Fort Gaines was right on the Chattahoochee River, and I took typhoid fever up there, like to have died. When school was out, I couldn't come home because I was too sick. I stayed there during the summer. Then Mama came up after school closed, and she stayed until I was able to travel. So then my mother said that I was not going back up there; my daddy said so, too. So then they sent me to Thomasville, Georgia, to school. I went down there and I was very smart. I was an A student. I thought I was somebody.
ALT: Were these schools for boys and girls? Were they all-girl schools?
ERL: The boarding school was all girls. But the boys could come in from the community. After Mama said I was not going back to Fort Gaines, on this river where I had typhoid, my daddy said the same thing. So there was a young woman at home who was going to live with some young girls, about four or five miles from us, who were going to Thomasville to school. Papa contacted them and they took me under their arm. I was still this little something, didn't know where I was going. I went to Thomasville to school with them and they took me under their arms and took care of me and watched me, and reared me. This is what these girls did for me. One especially.
This school had a mixed faculty. In those days, the Yankees came down and had these schools for Negroes. Well, this was one of these mission schools that was directed by northern teachers, who were all white, except for one, and she taught the second grade, I believe, second or third grade. Well,﻿4
ERL: (cont.) when I'd come home in the summer, my daddy always gave me an examination. "What did you learn? How did you do...read this, or read that." He was always testing me. I had to go to Sunday School and teach the Sunday School lesson, to see if I had been to school. [laughs] And so when I came, fortunately I guess I was pretty active, they gave me responsibilities in the school. I was one of the big leaders, see.
ALT: You were about how old at this time? About seventeen or eighteen?
ERL: I guess about seventeen. So when I came home one summer, I had been coming home and Papa had to give me these examinations as to what I was doing and everything, and I would talk about Miss Hardy and Miss So-and-So, and Miss So-and-So. So my daddy says to me, "Who is Miss Hardy?" I said, "That's one of my teachers." "Well, who is Miss So-and-So, is she colored?" I said, "No, she's white." "Well, who is Miss So-and-So, is she colored?" I'd say, ""No, she isn't." So he said, "You all don't have anything there but white teachers?" And so he immediately got busy, and I'm supposed to be a big time senior going back to finish. I was somebody, you know. Before I knew anything, he had made arrangements for me to come to Tuskegee Institute!
ALT: Is that right? Simply because there were no black teachers there, or Negro teachers, as they were called then?
ERL: Yes, ma'am. From what I understand, he had contacted a girl from Downey—
it's about ten miles from us—some girls that were coming here, to Tuskegee.
ALT: Did he ever say why he did not want you taught by white teachers?
ERL: Well, I'll tell you what. When I was growing up, we had several riots at home with the whites. The whites came, the Ku Klux Klan came and got my daddy, and took him out and beat him.
ALT: For no reason?
ERL: No, no, no. No definite reason. They said that he was leading the Negroes. At one time he worked at the sawmill. See, when the crops would catch up, he would work at the sawmill, and he was just living a little bit too well to be a Negro, see. A Negro's s'posed to be in a little cabin, and the white man tell him when to go and when to come. Well, Papa couldn't stand that.
ALT: And when the Klan came, did you know anything about this?
ERL: I know all about it. I'll tell you what started all of this. They had this big sawmill there and it was a big town, but there were sawmill people, you know, day laborers, and Papa owned his own little home, so he was independent. A white man, a policeman, went down in the quarters, and arrested a Negro about something, I don't remember what it was, but anyway he was going to take the Negro to jail. The Negro told him to go on, he wasn't going with him tonight, but "you go on, I'll meet you at the jailhouse tomorrow." And so the white man—in those days and times, a Negro didn't tell him what to do—he told him he was going, so the Negro said he wasn't. So it seems that﻿5
ERL: (cont.) an argument came up and the Negro killed the policeman. All of the white folks then started looking for a Negro, looking for him. They said he was known to shoot you, he was known to hit you. So my Papa was coming back from prayer meeting that night, he and somebody. They saw that something was happening. So they went by to see what it was. When they found out what happened, they came on home. They said that Papa helped this Negro to get away—he never did—but that started this riot. The white people rioted.
As I remember, they came from another community and I could see these white people on these great big mules, I haven't seen anything like that, with the shotgun riding across their backs, you know. And they'd come by, they would parade, and they would come right by our house. We lived right on the highway. They'd come by. And one night they came by and they shot in our house and the bullet—you're sitting there, I'm sitting here—the bullet didn't hit him, didn't hit any of us, but it hit the chair, right under there, right between us. So after that, Papa moved his family back on the place, in one of the rent houses, and we stayed there and he stayed at the house where we lived.
ALT: That was on his mind when he found out that you had all white teachers?
ERL: Yes. When he found out, he said to me, "Eunice, who is Miss..." and I'd say, "Well, she's so and so." "Is she white, what does she teach?" "Well, who is Miss Jones?" "She's the home economics teacher, she teaches sewing." "Is she white?" [laughter] "Well, who is Miss So-and-So?" "Miss Harlan, that's the principal." "Is she white, too?" So when I knew anything, he had contacted those girls who were going to school here in Tuskegee.
ALT: And this was the year before you would have graduated? So you didn't graduate with your class?
ERL: I didn't graduate, didn't make any difference. No. I said, "But Papa, I'm almost finished." He said, "Oh, all right, you can go to Tuskegee and finish, but you're not going back to that..." That was the way he felt about it. And that was that!
ALT: But you did finish out that year?
ERL: Yes, I finished that year. Because, see, he had done all of his thinking when I came home that summer. When he was questioning me, I didn't know what was wrong with him. But when I came home that summer, he had all his plans fixed for me to come to Tuskegee. Put me on the train and sent me to Tuskegee where I got an application. In those days, students were sleeping on the floor and everywhere.
ALT: What dormitories did they have you in?
ERL: They had me in every dormitory.
ALT: Exactly what happened when you arrived at Tuskegee? And about what year was﻿6
ALT: (cont.) this?
ERL: Let's see, 1918, 1919. 1918 because I finished in '22. Well, when I came to Tuskegee, as I said, I came and got me an application. And in those days, you stayed if you wanted to stay. This will make you laugh, sure enough. When I got registered, we had to sleep...do you remember Douglas Hall and the Y?
ALT: Yeah. Uh huh.
ERL: I slept down there six months. There were so many of us, we just had screens and we would make our little room. Say if you and I wanted to room together, we'd put screens around our beds [laughter] and "This is our room, don't you come in there." Then we moved from there, up on the second floor in Douglas Hall and from there...I think when I first got there I stayed in White Hall.
ALT: Did you have any money?
ERL: Any money? I don't know what I had. Daddy had sent fifteen or twenty dollars. [laughter]
ALT: The dean would accept you without money, without anything?
ERL: Without anything, if you wanted to come to school. I don't know, really and
truly, when you think about money, I don't know what I had. I don't remember. But anyway I know when I got registered, Mrs. Landers was talking to me, she said, "Little girl, what you going to take?" I didn't know. So the first year I went to work in handicrafts with Mrs. Owens and I enjoyed handicrafts. I enjoyed making baskets and mats and mattresses and all, it kept you busy, you know. And I just enjoyed it, so that was the first year I was there.
ALT: You didn't have any classes at all? Academic classes?
ERL: Yeah. Um hmm, yeah. I was first year then. See, I'd been in school with these Yankees, and that was one thing about it, you really learned, they really taught you. Whatever they taught you, when you got through with it, you didn't have to worry. I had the advantage over the other children my age, because fortunately, most of my life I had had very good teachers. So I went to work in the handicrafts and I enjoyed it, working with Mrs. Owens. See, we took some handicrafts down there, where I was, so I was a little bit advanced. Mrs. Owens had me directing pine needle baskets. And I learned how to make mattresses and I helped the other children that came in.
I went back home that summer after school was out, and Papa sat down and gave me an examination. You're talking about an examination! A fourth grader! He went into all the details. What was I doing and how was I doing with those books, giving me the examinations in mathematics. And I was never anything in mathematics. And he was this farmer, you know, tell me, "That bale of cotton weighs 700 and something and it's twenty cents a pound, how much money do I get out of it?" I'd have to go get a pencil and﻿7
ERL: (cont.) paper. That worried him so much. He wondered, "Why don't you put it in your head?"
ALT: Uh huh. And not have to figure it out on paper.
ERL: What's wrong with your head? So if you could tell him so much and so much, that quick, he'd tell you what the answer was. It just worried him because I'd have to get a pencil and paper, depend on it.
So to get back to the handicrafts, I went back home and told him and he talked and he talked. That was one thing about my father, he would take time to find out what you knew, where you've been, what you've been doing, and you wouldn't know you'd be telling it. But he'd put it all together and he said to me, "Eunice, don't they have something else over there besides that mattress making and shirt making stuff? What all do they teach over there?" And I told him, and he said, "Don't they have nursing over there?" And I said, "Yes, but Papa, I don't want to be no nurse, I don't want folks dying on me." He says, "Well, Eunice, everybody ain't gonna die on you. That's why you should be a nurse. That's what is being a good nurse, so you could help save the people." He says everybody's not going to die on me. There was a little hospital in the town about seven miles away. He said, "You can get a job down there." I said, "I don't wanna be in no hospital, I don't wanna be no nurse, 'cause I don't want them folks to die on me."
But when I came back to Tuskegee and registered to go to school, Mrs. Martin said, "Little girl." I don't know why they called me a little girl all the time, they could call me Eunice instead of little girl. [laughter] She said, "Are you going back into handicrafts?" I says, "No, ma'am, I want to be a nurse." "A nurse! Eunice, did you make any application for nursing?" I said, "No, you have to make an application?" [laughter] "I don't know whether Dr. Kenny's got any place over there for you or not. I don't know whether he wants you over there or not." She said, "Well, I'll tell you, you talk it over with Mrs. Landers."
She called Mrs. Landers and sent me up to Mrs. Landers's office, the dean's office. I got up there and she said, "Look girl, Eunice..." I said yes. She said, "Well, what's your problem now?" I said, "Mrs. Martin told me to come up here and talk to you." I don't think she realized that I was sitting in there when Mrs. Martin was talking to her on the telephone. So I said, "She told me to talk to you." "She said that you said you want to be a nurse." I said, "Yes, ma'am." "Are you right sure you want to be a nurse?" I said yes. Then Mrs. Landers started telling me all of the bad things about nursing, how the people get sick on you and die on you at night and how they do this and do that and how sick they get and everything. And she said, "Do you still want to be a nurse?"
ALT: Was this your idea? Had you really decided for yourself that you wanted to be a nurse or were you doing what your father had wanted?
ERL: Well, I decided and he influenced me, but I made up my mind myself. Uh huh.﻿8
ERL: (cont.) It was his decision but then it became a part of me. 'Cause really if it hadn't been, I never would have been a nurse. I had to make the decision within myself.
So then they sent me on over to the hospital to see Dr. Kenny. When I saw Dr. Kenny, told him who I was, and that Mrs. Landers had sent me over there, he says, "Little girl." [laughter] I don't know, I must have been mighty little, that's what they all called me, little girl! "Little girl, you wanta be a nurse?" I said, "Yes, Doctor." Well, then he started painting the dark side, what it meant, that people would get sick on you, and they'd die and this thing and that, it didn't faze me a bit. I told him I wanted to be a nurse. So he said, "Okay." Then he called Mrs. Landers, and they called back and forth and got me transferred. So I went on in nursing. We had our classes, and when you were a freshman, you were under the supervision of the senior nurse, and you sat with the real sick people. Dr. Kenny kept somebody right there by that patient. And it was usually the freshman nurses who did that. We could give them water and they taught us how to bathe them and this, that and the other thing. This is what we started with. Okay.
My first experience with the dead...This woman had been admitted to the hospital. She was dying when they admitted her, but I didn't know she was dying. The woman was lying up there snoring, I thought she was breathing... I thought when she stopped breathing, she stopped her snoring, I thought she was asleep. So the night supervisor came, making her rounds, and I'm sitting up there with this woman, dead as a doornail. [laughs] She said, "Miss Rivers, little girl, how is the patient?" I said, "Oh, she's all right, she's asleep." I didn't know the woman was dead. So she went over there and looked at the patient and took her pulse and everything and she turned around and walked on out. Finally she came back and said, "Miss Rivers, come here a minute. That woman is dead." I said, "Dead?" So then they put the screen around the bed and one of the older nurses helped prepare her for the morgue and I observed. So I went to the morgue with them and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was. And from that night on, if anybody was very, very sick in the hospital, if it was one of the nastiest patients they had, I was always the one who they put with that patient to watch them and care for them.
And that's how I got started nursing and, as my daddy said afterwards, I was a born nurse, just needed some training. I guess I was. So then after that, if anybody was very, very sick, Dr. Kenny always asked for me to special for that person. And then he made the remark, that he knew that his orders would be carried out. I stayed with them around the clock.
You know Mrs. Work. I nursed her. That's how I got attached to the family, the Work family. They are responsible for where I am today, Mr. and Mrs. Work. Because I took care of his wife and she was supposed to die, it was one of the dirtiest cases you could possibly have. I even got her ready to go to the morgue, that's right.[laughs] Yes, she was just that sick, we didn't expect her to pull through at all. So the night that the doctors had all given her up and everything, we got this table, got this ready to take﻿9
ERL: (cont.) to the morgue, and everything...
ALT: The nurses had to take the body?
ERL: Yes, to the morgue, outside the hospital.
ALT: There were no so-called orderlies in those days then?
ERL: No, no. Nurses did everything. They did everything. And at this particular time we just knew that Mrs. Work was going to pass. I worked the first six hours at night with Mrs. Work. I'd worked till around two o'clock that night. And you had to change and do all these things, it was a continuous job. This last night that she was supposed to leave us, they tried to make me go to bed and I wouldn't. I was going to stay there until she did pass, if she was going. So the next morning she was revived and you're talking about a happy person, I really was. And Mr. Work was the same way. She stayed in the hospital, I guess about three months. And after she was discharged to go home, they took me home with her. This was in my senior year then, and I stayed with her until she was able to get up and get around. In fact, I spent the summer with her.
ALT: How did you actually get training in the other more detailed aspects of
nursing care, giving the medication, taking blood, and that sort of thing? How was that done?
ERL: Well, we did not take blood at that time, when I was in training. It's just been in recent years that the nurses have taken—not recent years either, but recent as compared to what I was. We did not take blood but we took care of the patient's personal hygiene. Changed their beds. If they had to have a massage, we'd massage them. We'd bathe them, and we gave them their medication, whatever was given. Usually we had a medicine nurse who prepared medicines, and you had a tray, if you were going down the hall, they had the patient's name on the tray and his medicine was put on his card. So if I had medicine for you, I'd look down there and see, and see what you had.
ALT: But you didn't do that in your first year?
ERL: Oh no. You took care of your patients. And at that time we scrubbed the floors. We did the housekeeping too, you see. And of course in this progressivlsm, this is something I remember. The freshmen did most of the laborious work. As I said, our job was to sit with the patients when they needed attention like that. And you notified the nurse in charge that this patient was reacting or wasn't reacting and that kind of thing. We helped to clean them and get them meals and we'd just be there with them, you see.
ALT: ERL:
Now at the time you graduated from Tuskegee, you graduated as a nurse?
Yes.﻿10
ALT: At that time did you have to pass the boards?
ERL: You had to pass the boards, you had to take a state board.
ALT: Was the education that you had received up to that time sufficient for you to pass the board?
ERL: Yes. At that time, when we finished, you didn't have to go right on out and take the boards. I worked, I guess, about a year before I took the boards. When you get your diploma, you're supposed to have your registration, but in those days you didn't. And I worked a year before I took the boards.
ALT: What was your first job?
ERL: With the Movable School.
ALT: And what was that?
ERL: You don't ask me what that is!
ALT: I have to ask you so everyone else who reads this will know, [laughter] And you know, I've heard about the Movable School, I have a general idea, but I don't know the specifics of it.
ERL: I know what you mean. The Movable School was a bus, built on a white truck, and it was equipped with all of our equipment. We carried all of our equipment...
ALT: What kind of equipment was this?
ERL: Okay. Miss Hannah did canning, taught the people how to can, how to make mattresses and this kind of thing. We had...the people called it the fireless cooker. It was made out of a big barrel; they used to have salt fish in these kegs and they would line that wooden bucket with sawdust and something else to retain the heat. They'd put a hot brick in the bottom of the cooker. When the heat started the things cooking on the stove, say, if you wanted to have your vegetables start cooking, you'd take this brick, put it in this fireless cooker, and set the pot on the brick that you had in there. Then you would cover this cooker with a cotton pillow or something that you made round, then you could retain the heat, and put a top on it and let it stay until you were ready. Miss Hannah would fix that. A lot of times we had all of our meals prepared this way.
ALT: This was for the traveling group?
ERL: Yeah, uh huh. Uh huh. And, but then this was taught in the Movable School, we taught the people how to do this. Miss Hannah taught the people how to make mattresses and how to cook, how to clean...
ALT: What did they make these mattresses out of?
ERL: Cotton.﻿11
ALT: You'd make a large container, mattress size...
ERL: Yeah.
ALT: ...and then stuff it with the cotton.
ERL: And then you would tack it, see. Tack it and you would get these, what did we call them, wads of cotton, the rolls, the big rolls, and put in that mattress, see.
ALT: So then she was a demonstration agent.
ERL: Yeah, she was demonstration agent. And back to me, I had charge of health with the Movable School. I taught home nursing, how to bathe a patient, how to take a temperature, how to give a massage. With the mamas and babies—the poor little things had such poor care—how to bathe the baby, how to keep him clean. At that particular time, they had something on the head, scale, I don't know what it was. But they'd be taking care of the baby, they'd grease the baby and keep his head covered, tied up, and then we'd get all this stuff accumulating. I did that, and then we taught maternity care. That was how to care and to work with the midwives. All of this was my responsibility. Teaching the midwives how to deliver, how to wash their hands, cut their nails and how to deliver, how to make the pads, how to prepare the bed for the delivery, because at that time most of the women had the babies on the floor. We had an awful time trying to train the mothers to use the bed instead of the floor. We took paper— and there was no such thing as a draw sheet, a rubber sheet—so we carried old newspapers all the time, on the truck and clean rags and this kind of thing, trying to teach the people how to do this. If we'd get in a home where we could find somebody who had an old ragged sheet, we'd show them how to make a pad, paper pad, to protect the bed. And also how to bathe the babies, feed them and prepare their meals, their bottles and this kind of thing.
ALT: Were there any other groups represented on the truck, in the Movable School?
ERL: Miss Hannah with the demonstration, Mr. Howard with the farmers...
ALT: What did the farmers do?
ERL: Mr. Howard was a carpenter, he was a farmer and whatever else was needed.
Let me see, I have some pictures here—where are those pictures? I'll find them later, I hope. They made sanitary toilets. At that time, lot of the times Mr. Howard would have to build a toilet so we would have some place to go. And we built a toilet with a pit; that was what they called a pit privy. How to build a chicken house, how to put windows in the house and how to build steps. This was one of his specialties, step building. Screening. If you went into a community and the people could do it, they would settle and screen this man's house. He'd furnish the material; he'd teach 'em how to screen the windows and how to screen the doors, and how to build steps. Then he would take 'em on the farm and teach 'em how to prepare the rows for planting, how to gather the crops, how to do all the﻿12
ERL: (cont.) little things pertaining to a farm.
ALT: And there were just three of you?
ERL: Yeah. Just the three of us.
ALT: Did you always travel together as a group?
ERL: Yes. For the most part. When we went on these demonstrations, when we went on the Movable School, we were all together as a group.
ALT: Would the people come to you, just to a church or something, or would you go house to house?
ERL: No, the people came to us. I think I was telling you that we had the
stationary schools, and what they called, I've forgotten...transit schools. For the stationary school, we met at one home. For example, if we were working here, we would meet here every day, Monday through Friday. This was what we called the stationary school, where the people came to you at Mrs. Jones's house. They knew that there they were taught mattress making, and canning, anything, gardening and all of this. Whatever the women needed, whatever the men needed on the farm, they'd have the two together.
ALT: How did word get to the people to come to this school?
ERL: Well, it usually came through an agent in the county who worked these
schools up for you. And if it wasn't an agent, let's say, if a community wanted to get together and have somebody to come in and teach their people something about the work that we were doing, then preachers could work it up and make arrangements and get an appointment. But we usually worked with the county agents. Other people, other organizations could invite us to work in their community and teach, and they would work up the school for us, see.
ALT: Now you had something about maternity care before. I know sometimes there
are complications in maternity cases. Did you have any working relationship with a doctor or a hospital?
ERL: At those times, the granny midwives were the people that we had to depend
on. And they were taught that if they had any difficulties that they would get this patient to the doctor or get a doctor to come in. The granny midwife pretty well knew what to do within limits. Sometimes you'd find that we would have a time trying to get them to discontinue the teas and this thing and the other things, by getting out of bed on time, and getting up, keeping themselves clean and this kind of thing to prevent any odors. But if they had a problem, they would contact their doctors in their town, because most of the doctors were located in the town which was the county seat, just like here, Tuskegee, see.
ALT: When you stopped working for the Movable School, then what did you do? And how did you happen to leave?
ERL: Really and truly. I got with this syphilitic program that was sort of a﻿13
ERL: (cont.) hoodwink thing, I suppose. Not hoodwink, I don't mean it like that. But at that particular time, Macon County was overrun with syphilis and gonorrhea. In fact, the rate of syphilis in the Negro was very, very high, something like eighty percent or something like this. The argument, as I remember, was that the white man had neurosyphilis—that was infections of the spinal cord, these nerves and all. The Negro died with whatever the other one is—maybe I can remember. But anyway, the Negro had syphilis which affected his heart and liver, and organs of the body more so than the white man. The white man had neurosyphilis that was syphilis of the nerves. And at that time Macon County was overrun with syphilis. They had the highest rate of anybody in any of the southern counties.
ALT: How was this known? Were they routinely giving them blood tests, as to how it was diagnosed?
ERL: Well, I was going to say now how I got into this and how they found them. They were making this study, and they were comparing this study with a study of syphilis that was made in Norway, I believe. And they found that the white man there had neurosyphilis. Then they wanted to make a comparison. At that particular time, as I said, syphilis was rampant in Macon County. I think Macon County had the highest rate, and of course, at that particular time among Negroes, that could be. So then they wanted to do this study, so., how did I get into it now? I'm just trying to think, but anyway, maybe I'll back up and get to it. They wanted a nurse to work with them. Mr. Campbell recommended me to the health department; the health department took me on. These people came from Washington. Dr. Smith said to me, "Nurse Rivers, they want a nurse to work with these people." You see, these people were supposed to be down here only six months. And I was supposed to go back to them after the six months. And he asked me how would I like to do it? And I said, "Okay, I'll try." I was just interested. I mean I wanted to get into everything that I possibly could. So he said, "Well, do you want to take it? I think you'd be good." And I said, "Yeah, whatever I can do with it."
So then they came down from Washington, these doctors came from Washington. We went from community to community in Macon County, drawing blood, and treating the positive patients. Well, all patients were getting treatment, all of them, except these people who were included in the study. We had this bus that was equipped to go from community to community. It was a regular clinic, everything was sterilized. Preparation of your medicine, everything was on'this bus. The people would meet us, say, here at my house. Ten or fifteen people would be here. This would be one center. And we'd stop in and give treatment and draw blood. And so out of that grew this study, this VD study.
And so then after we got started with the study, they employed me, they wanted me to work with them. The people from Washington wanted me to work with them. That was just up my alley; it didn't get monotonous either. So then Dr Smith asked me, "Nurse Rivers, would you like to work with Dr. Wanger and them on the bus?" And then I said, "Well, Dr. Smith, what am I going to do with Miss Marriner?" See, I was with the state health﻿14
ERL: (cont.) department. And he said, "Well," and Dr. Wanger was one of these fussy folks, just fussy, just plain fussy; Dr. Smith said, "you are about the only one who can get along with him." I said, "Well, he don't make me no difference. I know what I'm doing, and I hope he knows what he is doing; it don't make any difference to me. He can yell all he wants. I don't even hear him." He said, "That's good, that's good, Nurse Rivers, that's good." I said, "I don't even hear him, Dr. Smith." I said, "Are you ready? I know I'm doing my work. He can rant all he wants to, he'll be the one dying of high blood pressure, not me." He laughed at that. So he told me, he said, "Well, I'll contact Miss Marriner over at the state health department." I said okay. So that's how I transferred to them. The state didn't want me to leave them, but I insisted. I was tired of that. I wanted to get into this. So this is how I got into this venereal disease study and worked with them. That started in 1932. So what the study consisted of, we had a positive group and a negative group. We had 400 positive groups and 200 negative groups that we studied...
ALT: Was this confined to Macon County or throughout the state?
ERL: No, not throughout the state, some of the adjoining counties, we had people who would come over to us. From another county they would come in, but we didn't go outside of Macon County to hunt patients. If they lived on the border, and they came over, then they became eligible for the study, then they could come nn in. We had several people who lived up around Auburn, some from Montgomery. But they came to us, we didn't go to them. They started out...having these people to meet us at these places where we would treat them. And after we drew their blood, and the doctors got a history on them, then they would decide who was who, whether he went to this side. But the patients were always asked if they wanted to come on this side or go on to the other side, see. And they never took anybody with early syphilis. And early syphilis was about three years or two years, that's considered early. After that, it was supposed to be late syphilis. What it was doing, it was doing it to you, you weren't transmitting it, see.
So this is how we got the study. We tried to match the age group on both sides, so many under fifty, this kind of thing. And with the study, the doctors would come down once about every two years and spend about three or four months in the county visiting, examining, X-raying. Honestly, those people got all kinds of examinations and medical care that they never would have gotten. I've taken them over to the hospital and they'd have a GI series on them, the heart, the lung, just everything. It was just impossible for just an ordinary person to get that kind of an examination.
ALT: Quite a bit has been written about that study over the last several years. How do you feel about the types of things that have been written?
ERL: A lot of things that have been written have been unfair. A lot of things.
We did not take cases that were early cases. Syphilis had done its damage with most of the people, see. And this was another thing that we had found. Now, they say that with the white man, syphilis affects the mind and﻿15
ERL: (cont.) this and that, but the doctors themselves have said that the study has proven that syphilis did not affect the Negro as it did the white man, you see. So this is the way it affected the people. And according to this study, there was always a question in their minds, I really don't think they ever have definitely decided, what and how, if it was as bad as has actually been said, you see.
ALT: How did this project end? That is, your participation with this assignment?
ERL: Well, it ended a couple of years ago when they started all of this publicity.
ALT: It lasted right up until that time? Were they still actively bringing people into the project?
ERL: Doctors came down, not every year, but about every two years. To begin with, they came down once a year after they had gone back. They would send a group of doctors down here and they would stay about two weeks or so, as long as they were needed. And they would examine and see the patients. They had a little medication for them. A lot of them at that particular time had poor appetites and poor blood, not enough iron in it. They furnished us with iron and that kind of thing, and tonics. So that the doctors came about every two years.
Then as the study grew and the patients grew older, they would come every year. Come down and spend two or three weeks with them. And honestly, those patients got good medical care. This is the thing that always hurt me, how they criticized. Those people would come down here and they'd get all kinds of extra things, cardiograms and...some of the things that I had never heard of. This is the thing that really hurt me about the unfair publicity. Those people had been given better medical care than some of us who could afford it.
ALT: What about their families' reaction, as it relates to you? Have they believed the press or have they still maintained their trust in you?
ERL: No. They love Mrs. Rivers.
ALT: So they understand?
ERL: In all of this that has gone on, I have never heard anyone say anything
that was bad about it. The funny thing about it is, sometimes they'd send these young doctors down and they would be short, you know how these young folk are. They were talking to the patients and saying, "You do so and so." "What, you crazy?" And I would go in there and get them. I said, "Now, we don't talk to our patients like this." I said, "They're human. You don't talk to them like that." I said, "I'm sorry." They'd calm down. This particular patient said, "Mrs. Rivers, go in there and tell that white man to stop talking to us like that." I had two white doctors who apologized. They said, "Miss Laurie, I didn't mean it like it sounded. I guess I was kind of upset." I said, "Well, you sounded terrible. I hope you don't do﻿16
ERL: (cont.) that any more, 'cause they are all human." I said, "If anything happens that you can't get along, that you can't get it through their head, just call me. We'll straighten it out. But don't holler at them." I said, "These are grown men; some of them are old men. Don't holler at them."
ALT: During the time that this project was going on, were you working in any other capacity, or was all of your time devoted to this?
ERL: I was working part time. When the doctors came down for their examinations and they spent from two weeks to four weeks, I worked over at the project. But after they had gone and we had cleared up everything, I was working with the health department in the maternity service, with the pregnant mamas and the midwives in the clinics, like that.
ALT: "Could you describe that a little bit more? Because I know that some of your work was at the John A. Andrew Hospital, but some was also out in the country.
ERL: I worked with clinics, and at that particular time, our maternity clinics were in John Andrew Hospital, the well-baby clinics and the maternity clinics.
ALT: This was something different than the training of midwives. This was a different program?
ERL: Uh huh. Miss Wilkerson had charge of the midwife training. I was not a midwife proper.
ALT: So the women who were coming there were not the women who would end up with a midwife, they would be with a doctor?
ERL: No, they would end up with a midwife too.
ALT: But they still came to the hospital?
ERL: They still came into the clinic. Most of them would have midwives, see. If they had complications or that kind of thing, they would be admitted on the program to deliver at the hospital. They had a special maternity program.
ALT: There was a document called "The Southern Letter" that was published back in 1929, and in there one of the agents wrote about you, regarding your visit to midwives in Greene County. You helped to get solution for babies' eyes, you went into homes and made people want to give you information. One of the write-ups for an award referred to you as a health adviser, a housing adviser, a financial adviser, a spiritual adviser, and a moral adviser. What were they talking about?
ERL: I don't know. [laughter]
ALT: It sounds like you brought more to the people than just nursing.﻿17
ERL: Well, I did. I'll put it this way. If Miss Rivers said, "Go ahead," that was the thing to do.
ALT: How did you build up that kind of trust? It sounds like they trusted you and loved you.
ERL: They did. But I don't know how I did it. As far as I was concerned,
every individual was an individual of his own. He didn't come in a lump sum, see. 'Cause you can take two people, one living next door to the other, yet they're very, very different.
I had people say to me when I was going in, "Miss Rivers, how did you get in that house?" I said, "Why? What do you mean?" "Those folks don't open the door for nobody like that, they'd go back and stay in the house like nobody'd be in there." I said, "Well, darling, I don't know. I was brought in there. They're people as far as I'm concerned. I don't go there dogging them about keeping the house clean. I go there and visit a while until I know when to make some suggestions. When I go to the house, I accept the house as I find it. I bide my time." I said, "Then when I get in there good, I can tell them what I want and go on about my business. But I don't ever go into any person's house, fussing with him about how he keeps his house, first." I said, "Sometimes I don't do a thing but go there, sit down there and talk. Then when they learn me..." I've heard people say, "Lord, Miss Rivers is coming to my house," and so and so and so. "She'd come in and there wouldn't be no room, so she'd put the things down, put the things on the floor and sit on the chair. I'd be so embarrassed, she wouldn't say nothing."
ALT: That's being a friend to people.
ERL: I accepted them as they were. And they accepted me. Then I could move
on. There were some I haven't been able to reach. I didn't reach them... It wasn't one hundred percent, but I tried to accept them as they were, see, not as what I wanted them to be. Not what I want. Accept them. And then when they find that you're interested in them, they welcome you. You don't have any trouble. I could get up right now in the car and go into a community where people are living and I work here. It may be three weeks, they'll meet me in town. "Miss Rivers!" I said, "Uh huh." "I saw you the other day when you was out there to so-and-so's house." I said, "Where were you?" "I was on my porch." I said, "You weren't on your porch when I passed there." Said, "No, I wasn't. I wanted to go check on the children. I just know you going to stop when you come back." And they'll laugh at me now for saying, some of them, some of the things..."Mrs. Rivers used to come to my house and say, 'Why in the world don't you do so and so?"' But I had known that person. I don't go in there and fuss with him the first time. Go in there and accept him as he is. When I sit down, sometimes they want to offer you something to eat, I'd say, "No, I just got through eating." That kind of thing, see.
ALT: I know you established a system of record keeping for the Bureau of Vital Statistics on births and deaths. Would you describe first why was the system needed, and then tell me what it is you did in order to provide the﻿18
ALT: (cont.) information the Bureau of Vital Statistics,needed?
ERL: At that particular time, Alabama was trying to get into the registration area. It didn't have anything definite as to births and deaths in the counties.
ALT: Did that mean for either black or white? For nobody?
ERL: This was for Negroes, because I worked down in south Alabama where the most Negroes lived, and they lived as tenant farmers. Midwives did most of the work. So there were many, many births and deaths that were not reported in Wilcox, Marengo County, all those south Alabama counties. So Alabama was trying to get into the registration area. So I was sent down to south Alabama to get a record of every child from six on down, make a birth certificate and get all the records of deaths. People were dying and they had no record of the deaths. So every week I would come in with a pack of certificates. In the office they would go through these certificates that I had brought in, and they would check the certificates against what they had in the office. And they found that the majority of deaths, stillbirths, and births had not been recorded. And this was how Alabama was able to get into the registration area. I spent about nine months going from plantation to plantation. And sometimes I could spend a day on one plantation getting the births and deaths in that area.
ALT: Did the people have accurate information on births, or do you think they were just giving you an estimate as best they could remember?
ERL: Some of them were accurate. Others we had to estimate. But the majority of them were correct. I only got from six years back. The midwives usually kept a little notation on a pad that they would have. But for the most part they were correct. The undertakers made their reports of deaths.
ALT: Did you have any help or did you have to do this by yourself?
ERL: Did it myself. I worked all day and would come home at night and sit down and try to systematize and organize the stuff.
ALT: Was it really safe to travel through the deep South alone back in those days?
ERL: Um hmm. It was much more safe than it is now. The people just marveled at the places I would go. I never shall forget the time...I had to go visit the local registrar. A white woman was the registrar. She had midwives in there and birth certificates that the children were four and five years old and their birth certificates had not been recorded. So I helped her with work in that area. And after I had seen the midwives and so forth, I went to see her, to work with her. In this particular county the registrar was a white woman. They had this big plantation there and the yard, the house...the place was as wide as from here to way back over there to the edge of those pines. This great big house, set down there in the yard. It was a pretty place. Porch all around there. So I went there to talk to the registrar. I parked the car and had to walk as far as to the﻿19
ERL: (cont.) house, it looked like from here up yonder, it certainly went back as far as the edge of the road, that far down. So when I got to the house, I knocked on the door. Walked up on the porch and knocked on the door. She came to me and I told her who I was. She said, "How did you get in here?" She grabbed me, pulled my hand. This great big old bulldog was coming along, just as unconcerned. She grabbed me and pulled me in the house. "How did you get in?" I said, "I just come on in the gate." She said, "Nobody is supposed to come in this yard." X said, "I don't know what he could do about it." [laughter]
I sat there with her for about an hour, going through her records. Every once in a while, she'd take a deep breath and wonder how I got in. That dog was not supposed to let anybody in there. And the way she talked, he could come and grab you. And so when I got back to the office, I was telling the folks about it. They say she don't know what kind of thing that... [laughter] One lady said, "I'm going to go with you one day." I said, "No, you ain't going with me." I said, "Ain't nobody going with me, lady. I can't help who it is." I said, "Now I'll go and get the information, but you all are not going with me." I said, "I can get the information if I go by myself, but if you're going to go, I won't get it. You ain't going to follow me. You tell me what you want me to do in the office and I'll go and do it, but you're not going to follow me down there, un unh." The first thing the Negroes would say [was] that I had been framing them.
ALT: It was very important to keep that level of trust. Did you ever think of leaving the South or the rural area to go into hospital work in the northern cities?
ERL: I never did. When I first came out of school, I had an offer to go to New York to work. I was going, I wanted to go to New York then just like all the other little women, green things. But back to Mr. Work. Mr. Campbell was looking for a nurse for the Movable School. So Mr. Work asked me what I was going to do. He was just like my daddy. Papa asked me, "What you going to do now?" Well, there were two or three little hospitals down there that were wanting nurses, so I was going to work down there. So Mr. Work called me or sent me a letter, and asked me to come back to Tuskegee, and Mr. Carter, do you remember William Carter? He was the treasurer. He was a very good friend of mine. He and Mr. Work got me to come back here to work with Mr. Campbell. And that's how I came back to Tuskegee. 'Cause when I left, I didn't know where I was going, I didn't know what I was going to do. But Mr. Work called me and I came back on January 1, 1923, and went to work for the Movable School. And Papa said, "What are you going to do?" I said, "I don't know." My daddy was always asking me what you going to do. I said, "Mr. Work and Mr. Carter told me to come back. I'm going."
ALT: And then you worked until you retired in 1965 from the Public Health Service. Before you retired, you received an outstanding service award?
ERL: Yes.
ALT: Why don't you tell me about your honors and awards?﻿20
ERL: Well, this Oveta Culp Hobby Award was for, I believe, for the most outstanding work. This was the award. That's when I cried. This happened in Washington, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. They paid my way there and back, and they treated me royal. I was wined and dined and everything, and that was for the most outstanding work. And these other awards were a thirty-year award, and you can see that better than I can, I expect.
ALT: This one says, "Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Eunice Rivers Laurie is hereby awarded this certificate for distinguished service for an outstanding contribution to health, through her participation in the long-term study of venereal disease control in Macon County, Alabama'." That was April 18, 1958, in Washington, D.C. And this is the Oveta Culp Hobby Award, "For notable service covering twenty-five years during which through selfless devotion and skillful human relations she has sustained the interest and cooperation of the subjects of the venereal disease control program in Macon County, Alabama." And this one is a Certificate of Appreciation presented by the Communicable Disease Center to Eunice R. Laurie, "In grateful recognition of thirty-three years of service in the government of the United States of America. Presented on the 24th day, November 1965." And this one, "Certificate Awarded to Eunice R. Laurie in recognition of the completion of thirty years service as an employee of the government of the United States of America." That was awarded April 1963.
These awards that you have received, I know they must have a very deep personal meaning for you. Are you able to say which one has the greatest meaning? Which of these means the most?
ERL: That is a problem to me, because I appreciate all of them. But I believe the Oveta Culp Hobby Award would be my choice.
ALT: Are you able to say why?
ERL: No. It just is. I just appreciate all of them. To me, all of them mean a great deal, because I was really not working for this type of reward. I was working for the patients and tried to do the best for the patients who needed it. As far as awards are concerned, all of them are very important. But somehow I would name the Oveta Culp Hobby Award.
ALT: Mrs. Laurie, since you have been retired, have you been out of the health care field completely, or have you continued to work?
ERL: Well, I retired from the work off icially in 1965 from the health department.
But I did go back to work with the county health department with the maternity clinics. I worked there until my retirement in 1975.
ALT: So you retired two times?
ERL: Uh huh.
ALT: We haven't talked too much about your life other than career, your professional﻿21
ALT: (cont.) work. What has the church meant in your life?
ERL: Church has been my mainstay. When I was physically able, I attended Sunday School and was the teacher of the adult class. I attended regular church services every Sunday, and then we had BYPU*, that's what they used to call it. It's Christian education, every Sunday. Well, I've just been active, attending the conventions and working, especially with young people. That's how I've spent most of my time.
ALT: Have you been affiliated with any other organizations?
ERL: No. Well, I have worked with the Red Cross, with various organizations. It's been so long since I worked with them. But I have worked with the Red Cross quite a bit. But as of now, I am not active with any of those things.
ALT: Have you encountered any problems or barriers to your work because of your marriage and family life?
ERL: No, no. That has not entered into it at all.
ALT: Though the work required that you travel and that sort of thing?
ERL: No. My husband was always very liberal and if I needed to go somewhere
at night, he would take me or go with me. Maybe I get a call that such and such a person is very sick. A lot of my patients would not call a doctor until I had come to see them to see how they were doing, and see if they needed a doctor. I had an awful time training them to go ahead and get their own doctor. But there was never a time since we've been married, and we have been married twenty-odd years, that he has refused to go with me at night.
ALT: You mentioned that your father had a tremendous influence on your life and you mentioned Mr. Work here at Tuskegee influenced your life. Were there any women who influenced you, that you recall?
ERL: Well, Mrs. Daily and Miss Hannah, both demonstration agents. They had a lot of influence on me and guided me. Because when I first went to work, and especially Miss Hannah, I was green as grass. I had no experience whatever. And she just took me under her arm as her own daughter or sister, something like that. Well, consider that the entire extension staff, they really gave me support, the men and the women. There were only three women. There was Miss Hannah, Miss Jones, and Mrs. Daily.
ALT: You mentioned that as a child, you knew that your father was whipped by the Klan, needlessly. Did that influence your racial attitude as you grew up?
ERL: Yes it did. Growing up, I did have a peculiar feeling towards the white
man. But after I started to work and came in close contact with the white people, I decided differently, that they all were not bad. I must say that the white people that I worked with were always very, very cordial and very
* Baptist Young Peoples Union﻿22
ERL: (cont.) nice. I remember when we used to go to Birmingham, to our
nurses' meetings, and Negroes had to ride the freight elevator to get upstairs to the meeting. And Miss Marriner, she was white, but she would always ride that elevator up with us. She would never get on the other elevator, but she rode with us on this elevator going up.
ALT: Did you have professional meetings that were integrated even before integration came to Alabama?
ERL: Yes. The nurses here...we would go to state meetings. There weren't
but about four of us, Negro nurses. But we would go and we would attend the meetings. We had very little to say, but we would be there. And this same lady that I'm talking about, when the other white nurses would go to the cafes to get their food, she would take us to her apartment and have the meals sent up to us.
ALT: As you think back over your career, do you think of any barriers that were there simply because you were a woman or because you were Negro, that stopped you from doing something that you might have been able to attain, had you been of a different sex and race?
ERL: Now state that question again.
ALT: Okay. Let's talk about race first. Do you think of any barriers that
stopped you from doing something that you wanted to do simply because you were black?
ERL: No, I don't think of anything. No, I don't.
ALT: Or maybe the nature of the work, the fact that they had black nurses for black people, that's just the way it was.
ERL: Uh huh. In the state health department, as I remember it, there were only three Negro nurses at that particular time when we first started to work. I got my training in public health under one of those Negro nurses• That Miss Marriner, who was the director of the 9tate [health department], assigned me to work with her. And fortunately everybody was very fond of this particular nurse, and she assigned me to work for her, so that I never ran into any blocks or anything of that kind. I don't know whether it was because I was working with this particular nurse or whether the work was sort of arranged. We attended the same meetings, and this kind of thing, even though, as I said before, we had to go up on the freight elevator, she would go up on the freight elevator, too, with us up to the meetings.
So that if there were problems—there were some problems—'cause I never shall forget...in one of the counties, I was working, and a white woman... what was it that happened? A white woman hit my car? Yes. The school children were passing, I believe, and I was slowing down, so the white woman was behind me and she wasn't watching where she was going. I stopped and she hit my car. She got out and raised Sam, she pitched a blue...So when I moved on, I didn't go on to dinner or wherever I was going. I don't remember now all the details. But I got out and went on back to the﻿23
ERL: (cont.) health department, and I told the nurse in there what had
happened. So she said, "Okay, nurse, you stay here and I'll bring your dinner." So she brought my dinner, and in the meantime, when the health officer came in, she had me tell him what I had told her. Oh, the woman just raged, she just ranted and she just carried on something terrible. They had told me to come to court or something, and the health officer went to the police and told them who I was and everything. And they told me that the health officer told this policeman that I was down there helping them and he didn't want anything done about it...the woman hit me, and I was down there helping, and he wanted it quieted down, because he needed me.
This was one of these black counties, see, and it was bringing their records down instead of...so he said, "Don't bother me. Don't bother that nurse because she's down here helping us. And furthermore, that woman should have been looking ■where she was going." And I never heard any more about it. So then he assigned me, this was in Marengo County, I think it was Marengo, anyway, it was between Demopolis and Greensboro, and so wherever this was, the county was divided such that the Negroes were on one end and whites were on the other end. I was sent down there to do this vital statistics work. So he told me, "You stay up here.11 He said, "Just forget that other end of the town." Anyway, I stayed in Demopolis and worked for them. I went to the office every Friday. If I needed to go to the office, I'd go to the office, but I didn't have to bother about the folks on that end, because most of them was white. He said, "They need you, too, but you just go on and don't bother." He said, "Just let them do the best they can. When they wake up and find out what you're getting, then they'll..."
ALT: Do you think that being a woman limited your options in the medical
profession? That is, had you been a man, would you have wanted to be a doctor, or do you think you were prevented from being a doctor simply because you were a woman, if that: was your interest?
ERL: I don't think so. I think if I had wanted to take medicine, I could have gone on into medicine. There was a nurse, we had a female doctor at the hospital. I never was interested in medicine as such. I was interested in the person, and it just never occurred to me that I wanted to be a doctor. I always felt that the nurse got closer to the patient than the doctor did, that was the way I felt about it.
I could go way out in the county, and a lot of times we would have interns
from the hospital going with us, and the interns would be so short with the patients. They'd tell me, "Miss Rivers, don't you bring that man back out here no more. You can tell us what to do." This is the way they registered with me. They depended on me so it never occurred to me...they would take whatever I said. So this is the reason that I always tried to know that I was right. I would call Dr. Dibble and ask Dr. Dibble about such and such a thing. If some white doctor told me something that I wasn't too sure of, or if he just told me that because...I'd go tell Dr. Dibble. "What is it now, Miss Rivers?" I said, "Dr. Dibble, I've got a problem." "All right, nurse, sit down." So I'd come back and tell Dr. Dibble. He said, "Well, what did you say?" I said, "I didn't say nothing." He said, well, you do such and﻿24
ERL: (cont.) such a thing and such and such a thing and it will be all right. Dr. Dibble knew that I really knew how to handle the white man. And if something came up that I wasn't so sure of, I would find him and he'd tell me what to do. So being a doctor never made me think that I would be closer to the patient.
ALT: Which you wanted to do.
ERL: Yes. 'Cause after all, the doctor saw the patient and he was gone. And it was up to you to help that patient carry out his orders, do whatever the doctor suggested. The doctor said, you do so and so and so and so. First thing, the patient doesn't know how to do it. He doesn't know what his reaction is going to be. He doesn't want to be stuck, this kind of thing. So the nurse plays an important part there. She's closer to the patient. Patients would get to the point where if they're not sure, they're going to ask you. They get you in the middle.
ALT: Now that you have retired for the second time, what are your plans for the future?
ERL: Me and the dog. Ilaughter] We go walking, we go riding...
ALT: I think you have answered all of my questions. Is there anything else you want to say for the record?
ERL: Well, I hope that I've given you some information that will be helpful for you.
ALT: We are now ending this interview with Mrs. Laurie. Thank you very much, the information will be very, very helpful, I'm sure.﻿
