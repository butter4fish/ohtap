We are here with Dean Virginia Lacy Jones at the School of Library Service at Atlanta University. Dean Jones, how are you doing today?
Fine, thank you.
That is very good. And we are going to conduct an interview for the Black Women Oral History Project of the Schlesinger Library. Dean Jones, why don't you tell me something about your parents, about your mother and father?
Well, my father died when I was about eighteen months old, so I have nothing to say about him. I do not remember him. And I have had practically no contact in all my life with my father's family. So the only family I have to talk about is my mother's family. My mother was one of a large family. Well, we thought it was a large family, five children. I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. When my father died, my mother moved back home with her mother and reared me by herself. We were poor. My mother kept boarders. The boarders were made up of professional people who lived in the small town of Clarksburg, West Virginia. They made a very good environment for me to grow up in because all of them were rather accomplished people and I guess I aspired to be a professional person too at a very early age.
I always did very well in school. My mother was very strict in terms of discipline, in terms of studying and getting my lessons. I took piano lessons from the time I was a little girl and performed in piano recitals. We were both very active in the﻿2
VJ: (cont.) Methodist church. My mother for many years was the treasurer of the church. I sang in the choir and went to Sunday school. I used to go in summer to what they call Summer Vacation Bible School. We had a very large garden; I used to work in the garden. We grew our own vegetables and we had a lot of grapes. We had a very, very large grape arbor. I played with white and colored children in the neighborhood and in a way had a very happy childhood. I was interested in music, and neighbors taught me how to crochet and my mother taught me to knit and embroider. As a little girl, I was always making things. I grew up liking very much to do things with my hands. I did very well in school and was always encouraged to do my best by my mother who expected the very best out of me.
Mother was trying to save money to send me to college. I had an aunt, my mother's youngest sister, who was married to a teacher in the high school system in Saint Louis, Missouri. When I finished the second year of high school in Clarksburg, West Virginia, my aunt and uncle persuaded my mother to send me to Saint Louis to live with them to finish high school, because the high school was a very good one. If I established residence there, I could go to Stowe Teachers College in Saint Louis and get my college work without having to pay for it. Well, reluctantly I went to live with my uncle and aunt and with the idea I would go to the Stowe Teachers College when I finished high school. I was very unhappy with my uncle and aunt, and my senior year in high school was a very unhappy one. I had decided then that whether I went to college or not, I would not stay in Saint Louis and go to college. By that time, I decided that I did not necessarily want to be a teacher, but that I wanted to be a librarian. I really wanted to go to Howard University in Washington, D.C.
The year I finished high school there was a failure of banks all over the country as we were moving into a very heavy depression. My mother lost her meager savings, and that would have been the savings that would have started me out to go to college. So, I came back to West Virginia in the summer and talked with the older sister of one of my former playmates who was a neighbor and who had gone to Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia. She informed me that at Hampton, you did not have to have a lot of money, that you could go to Hampton on a work-study plan. I wrote to Hampton and I got admitted, and I got a scholarship and an opportunity to work to earn part of my expenses. Of course, my mother helped with some of the expenses and that way I got to go to college. I have never regretted it. I have always felt that the fact that I had to work to go to college made me a better person. The experiences that I had in working have been very, very valuable parts of my education.
FB: What was your mother's name?
VJ: Her name was Ellen Parker Lacy.
FB- Lacy You said that you were born in Cincinnati and your mother
moved back home-that was in Clarksburg, that was her home in West Virginia. Now you said your mother had five brothers and sisters,
right?﻿3
yj: No, there were five of them altogether. She had two brothers and two sisters. There were five children in the family.
FB: How many children were in your family?
VJ: Nobody but me.
FB: Oh. Did your mother ever have any other children?
VJ: No.
FB: Now, did you know your grandmother on your mother's side, or your grandfather?
VJ: I knew my mother's mother just very vaguely, but I knew my
Grandmother Parker. Well, I remember her, on my grandfather's side. She was about ninety-six years old when she died. And I remember.
FB: Tell me something about her.
VJ: Well, all that I can probably remember is that she was quite elderly and very sweet. She would always take my side of an argument if I was going to get a spanking. She would always protect me from getting a spanking. She died, I guess, when I was about six or seven years old, but I do remember her.
FB: Did she live with you?
VJ: Yes.

VJ:
So you and your grandmother and mother lived together. She was there for a short while, and then you and your mother lived alone. Since you were an only child, how did you get along? Did you feel like you had to play with a lot of other children to get companions? Did you have a lot of friends when you were growing up?
I did have a lot of friends, but my mother encouraged me to read. I was, I think, about the only black child in my neighborhood that used the public library, and Mother had always had something going at home. I took piano lessons. I was interested in working in the garden. I had my little section of the garden. My mother and I were very close. I helped her in the house a lot.
Did you grow up with any cousins or...just those who were around you?
I had one cousin who lived in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Occasionally we visited each other.
Tell me something about Clarksburg. Was it Clarksburg, West Virginia? What kind of place was Clarksburg?
Well it is a small town, about thirty to thirty-five thousand population. When I grew up there, there were about twelve hundred residents. It was sort of a trading center for the coal-mining﻿4
VJ: (cont.) areas in northern West Virginia. It is just 120 miles
south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and relatively few blacks in the community have had educational advantages...
FB: What did your mother do?
VJ: I told you she kept boarders. People ate their meals at our house. At that time, black people could not go into restaurants. There were a number of schoolteachers there. There happened to be a black doctor, and a black dentist. And there was a black pharmacist there who was the son-in-law of Mary Church Terrell. You know who she was, in Washington, D.C. Because he ate his meals in our house, I got to visit the Terrells, and met Judge Terrell before he died, but I had a great deal of contact with Mary Church Terrell, who was a very outstanding black woman in Washington, D.C.
FB: Tell me about some of the people who were important to you as you were growing up.
VJ: Well, my mother was the most important person, who was always very ambitious for me to do my best and become someone. I think my music teacher was an inspiration, a very beautiful lady, who taught me piano and had a great influence on me. I think the people I met in the church inspired me to do well. That was about it.
Now, your music teacher you said was an inspiration to you. What kind of person was she? Why did she inspire you?
Because of her high standards of excellence, her interest in me as a person, I admired her for her knowledge and ability in the field of music We had a little club of students that were interested m piano. It was called the Hazel Harrison Piano Club. They used to have a lot of very outstanding black people come to Clarksburg to speak and to perform, and Hazel Harrison gave a recital there, and we got to meet her. In those days, we had a very hardcore segregation, and black people had to inspire each other to do their best in order to overcome the barriers of segregation, and to make you feel that even though you were segregated physically, that you grew up with an open mind toward people in general. I was taught a sense of values that was not based on race. I think my mother did that, and I think the people in the church did that. I remember my music teacher was that kind of person.
You mentioned the fact that you had played with black and white children. Was your neighborhood integrated?
FB:
VJ:
FB:
VJ: Yes.
FB: Did blacks live next door to whites? VJ:
Yes, it was all mixed up. It was a neighborhood in which a number of the whites who lived in that neighborhood were Catholic. Some of them were Italian, some of them were not, some of them were of Irish descent, but it was a multiethnic neighborhood that I grew up in.﻿5
FB: In terms of the segregation, you have mentioned the fact that you went to the public library. Was that facility integrated?
VJ: The public library there was never segregated, and although there were separate schools, and you could not go in restaurants, lunchrooms, soda fountains, and drugstores, there was no segregation in the library.
FB: As a child, how did you as a person feel about being set apart, segregated, not able to go in certain facilities?
VJ: Oh, I do not think it worried me too much. It just did not bother me an awful lot. I played with white kids- I did not begin to notice it until we got high school age, and then I went away. The thing that worried me the most was the fact that because I was fair of complexion, a number of the black children that I went to school with used to call me "half-white nigger," and that hurt my feelings. My mother used to talk with me about that. I would say that I felt more discrimination in my own group than I did with the other group, because I was not exposed to the other group that much. That did not come up. The members of my family were of all colors. Some were very fair, some were very dark, and within the family group that did not matter, but when I went to public school, there were kids that would say ugly things to me about my color, and that was very unpleasant.
FB: These were black kids?
VJ: Yes.
FB: Did they feel like, or did you feel like you got any special advantages because you were fair?
VJ: No, I did not. I felt I got special advantages because I used to
study and get my lessons. My mother never permitted me to leave or to stay out of school. I used to feel that it was more because of jealousy because you did your work, and your behavior was more or less exemplary, because my mother would not have permitted, would not have tolerated anything less than that. I used to feel the reason they said these ugly things to me was because of that.
FB:
VJ:
What about in Saint Louis? That was a different part of the country and different kind of people.
When I went to Saint Louis, I ran into just the opposite kind of thing. It was a very large high school, with probably almost two thousand children in it, and I found out that Saint Louis was, well, coming from a small town and going into a large city like that, it was very difficult for me to adjust. A friend of my aunt's was the manager of the school cafeteria at this very large high school, and as soon as I started in high school I got a job as a cashier in the cafeteria. This threw me in contact with the whole student body, and I got to be known rather quickly, really more quickly than I could adjust to the change in the kind of the situation that I had come from. I found out that in Saint Louis, if someone in your﻿6
VJ: (cont.) family was a schoolteacher, a doctor, a lawyer, a
minister, or worked in the post office, that that was considered a status symbol.
I found out that there were cliques of young people in the school that selected the people that they wanted to be friendly with, the girls that they wanted to be friendly with, on the basis of color. So, instead of having ugly things said because of my skin color, I was invited to affiliate with these little cliques of girls who more or less got together on the basis of being fair. But the funny thing about it—they did not have any color discriminations where the young men were concerned. They never had that. And I ran into a conflict. I disliked that more than I disliked being called "half-white nigger" in Clarksburg. And I rebelled against it, and said that I would pick my friends on the basis of people I liked, and whether their families had the kind of background of the girls with a fair color was not going to make any difference. I stuck to that. But that created some problems for me. It was an entirely different ballgame. It was a little hard to get adjusted to, to understand. But now that I am older and look back on it, I can understand it better. I am glad of the fact that I did it. I had no pride in that. I recognized the contrast of the two different situations very early, and decided that I could not go that route at all, and I spurned that kind of thing.
FB: Was this a black school, or was it a mixed school?
VJ: Oh, no, it was a black school They had segregated schools. Saint Louis was segregated too, back in those days, just like Clarksburg was.
FB:
VJ:
In terms of the neighborhood, was the neighborhood different? Was the neighborhood integrated at all?
No, the neighborhood was not integrated. It was an all-black neighborhood. We lived on Enright Avenue. That was supposed to be a prestigious section of the city for blacks. That is why I was thrown with these kids that had these little cliques and that kind of thing.
FB: In terms of the change from playing with both black and white children, what kind of difference did you see?
VJ: Well, of course I was older then and, as I said before, I chose my friends on the basis of those that I liked regardless of their color, and I did not get involved in some of the cliques. The cliques that would have been most natural for me to fall into, in terms of the neighborhood and my uncle's status in the community.
FB: You mentioned that the year that you graduated from high school,
the banks fell apart, and this was the Great Depression. What kind of special difficulties did you experience because of this?﻿7
VJ: Well, we just did not have the savings that my mother had had.
They were gone, which meant that she had almost no money to help me go to college. It was sort of a disappointment to her that I refused to stay in Saint Louis to go to Stowe Teachers College, and I just faced my mother with "either I do not go to college," because I was not going to stay in Saint Louis and live with my uncle and aunt. The fact that I came home and got admitted to Hampton Institute meant that I could go on to college. It meant that I had to work very hard when I got to college. I made my own clothes, because I knew how to sew and my aunt in Saint Louis had very nice clothes. Except for the clothes I made, the clothes I had were the clothes that she discarded and gave me, and I fixed them to fit me. I never got to go home for Christmas. I worked every summer, and we just had a hard time trying to make ends meet.
FB: What about your mother's business, in terms of keeping boarders? How did the whole depression affect her?
VJ: Well, it did not affect her in that way, because the people were still living there and still took their meals at our house.
FB:
VJ:
FB:
VJ:
So they were still able to pay for their meals?
VJ: Yes. FB:
Do you feel that perhaps the depression was not as hard then on your mother as perhaps it was on some other people, say, that had to go on relief?
Well some people probably did have to go on relief; my mother did not ' It just meant that it was very hard for me to go to college, that is all. But, my mother managed. She was a marvelous manager.
So you went to Hampton Institute in what year—1929? VJ: Twenty-nine. FB:
of going into you were there7
Twenty-nine. Fall of '29. And you went there with the intention of going into the library. Is that what you went right into when
No I had to go to college three years, and the fourth year I went in'the library school, and got a Bachelor of Science in Library Service degree. But this meant that if I got the degree on that basis and then I wanted to get a master's degree, I had to go back to college and finish that fourth year of college. So I went to Hampton three years, and the fourth year I went to library school and I got a Bachelor of Library Science degree in '33. Then I worked two years and then went back to Hampton in '35 to '36, and finished my fourth year of college, and got another degree from the School of Education, with a major in social studies and a minor in English. After that, I could get admitted to do further graduate study because by that time I knew that I wanted to get a master's degree in library sci-But I could not get enrolled in the master's degree program
ence.﻿8
VJ: (cont.) unless I had a four-year bachelor's degree and the fifth-year professional degree in library science. So I got two degrees from Hampton Institute, one in '33 in library science and one in '36 in education with a social science major.
FB: At the time you went to Hampton Institute, that was a depression year. Tell me something about student life you had to face...
VJ: At Hampton? Oh, I liked it. I guess those were some of the happiest years of my life. I had a lot of friends. I belonged... They did not have sororities and fraternities at Hampton. They had two of what they called literary clubs, and Phillis Wheatley Club and the Calliope Club. I was invited to join the Phillis Wheatley Club. They used to have parties, dances, guest speakers, and all kinds of club activities. The spirit of it was very much like sorority sisters, and they had the same thing for the men. There were different kinds of clubs. I was very active in drama. I belonged to the Hampton Institute Players, and was in a number of plays. The Hampton Institute Players used to go to other cities and give plays, and I got to travel with them. I did not make the choir. I never could sing, but I was interested in dancing and I used to do ballet dancing. I used to belong to a dance group with the physical education department.
I worked hard at Hampton. I used to wait tables in the teachers' dining room. Many of the teachers lived in the dormitories in those days. You got so much a month for cleaning a teacher's room, and you had to go every morning and clean up the teacher's room, make up the bed, and once a week you had to do general cleaning in the teacher's room. Then there would be a matron to check behind you to see that you had done it correctly, and I used to work in the Hampton Institute Library. I remember I used to make eighteen cents an hour.
I enjoyed Hampton. I did very well in my studies there, and made a lot of friends. I kept my grades up so that I could keep my scholarship because I could not have stayed there if it had not been for the scholarship. I would go home in the summers, but we never had money for me to go home at Christmastime. That used to be sort of sad. All the other kids would be going and I could not go, but I would stay and work during the holidays and I would make extra money that would help me pay my bills. All in all, I liked it very much. I had been very unhappy living in Saint Louis, and this was quite a relief to go where I enjoyed being. Many students did not like Hampton, because they had very strict regulations about your behavior. This never bothered me very much, because my mother had always been very strict with me, and I did not rebel against that.
FB: Did a lot of students rebel against it?
VJ: Some did.
FB: Were they very strict about rebels?﻿They sent you home. There were no ifs and ands about it. They would send you home at the least provocation. I was not about to get sent home after all the sacrifices that were being made to keep me there. After all the hard work I had done, I was going to stay there. I was not about to throw it away because I knew that I could not go any place else, in terms of money and that kind of thing. There again, there were not many people from Clarksburg that got to go to college. Those that did went to West Virginia State in West Virginia at Institute, West Virginia,and, for some reason or other, I never wanted to go there. I had a lot at stake and I was not about to fool around and get put out of school for any kind of misbehavior.
Now, it seems as though the opportunities in library service would have been limited for blacks at that time. Were they? Were there opportunities? Why did you choose library service?
There were opportunities. Not as many opportunities as there were later on, but there were practically no professional black librarians. I had enjoyed the public library in Clarksburg. I had enjoyed the public library in Saint Louis, Missouri, and I worked in the library in the high school in Clarksburg my first two years there, and at some time or other was a student assistant in the high school library at Sumner High School in Saint Louis.
I think one of the things that really caused me to say I did not want to be a teacher was that I was very unhappy living with my uncle and aunt. There was a citywide essay contest in Saint Louis, citywide among blacks, an essay on why you should go to Sunday school. I entered the contest, and went to the Saint Louis public library to read materials to write that essay. Well, the Clarksburg library was a small library, and when I went in this big library, the reference librarian showed me how to use the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature and the various indexes and all that kind of thing. And I went Saturday after Saturday to that library to read the periodical literature and to write that essay. I was just thrilled with the fact that I could go in a public library with a subject and someone would show me all of these tools that would open up all of this information and ideas to me. That, I think, was the thing that made me determined that I wanted to be a librarian. Strangely enough, I won the first prize in that citywide essay contest. I do not think I ever went back to Sunday school any more afterwards! But I knew by then that there was no question in my mind that I wanted to be a librarian.
All right, you went to Hampton. You were in library school. You were in college and in library school, and you were back in college again, getting aaother degree. What kind of people usually got a chance, what kind of people did you meet at Hampton? You had been in a small town, and now you'd gone to this big city, and you had run into this criticism.﻿10
VJ: At Hampton there was a mixture of people from large cities and
small towns and rural areas, a very diverse group, very interesting group, and there was none of that clique business based on family background, color, and that kind of thing which I did not like.
FB: All right, you said that there were hardly any professional black librarians when you were in high school...
VJ: Very few.
FB: ...and that there were some opportunities. Where were the opportunities?
VJ: The opportunities for the most part were in black college libraries, and a few in public libraries. They were just beginning to have black school librarians. But at that time the real opportunities were in the colleges, because the foundations, the private philanthropic foundations, were giving money to colleges to develop their library resources, and of course to do this they had to have professionally trained librarians.
FB: All right, now you got out of college, and what did you do next?
VJ: Well, when I got out of college, I was offered a job as a school librarian back in Saint Louis, at a salary of $2800 a year. Now that was a big salary back in those days. I did not want to go back to Saint Louis, and the dean of the library school at Hampton Institute told me that if I wanted to go on and advance in the profession, I would do better to go on into college library service, because that was where I would get the opportunity to get fellowships to do further study. She pointed out that money was not everything in getting started. It was important to begin in the right place.
Well, my second job offer was in Clarksville, Tennessee, as a school librarian. I turned that down. Then I got a job offer to go to the Louisville Municipal College Library as assistant librarian, in Louisville, Kentucky, and that is what I took. Because, Dr. Clement, who later became president of Atlanta University, was the dean of that college, and his father was a bishop in the A.M.E. Zion Church, and I took that position. That was being in the right place at the right time. That moved me along to other things that have happened in my lifetime, and it was a very wise choice. I worked there '33 to '34, '34 to '35, and then the fall of '35, I went back to Hampton and got that other degree, the Bachelor of Science in Education.
Then, I went back to Municipal College. The woman who had been the head librarian had left, and I went back as head librarian. Now that was the black branch of the University of Louisville. See, at that time, Negroes could not go to the University of Louisville, but they had a separate college called Louisville Municipal College, on a separate campus for blacks. I went back there as librarian.﻿11
VJ: (cont.) My first year there I lived in a private home, and then other years I lived other places, but I got a General Education Board fellowship, after one year there, to go to the University of Illinois to get my master's degree. The General Education Board said that they were going to give a scholarship to a person on the faculty or staff at Municipal College, and Miss Florence Curtis, who was the director of Hampton Library School, suggested to Dr. Clement that it be given to me. Dr. Clement said that if anybody got a fellowship for further study on his staff, he would rather have it be a teacher instead of a librarian. Well, this hurt my feelings very much, but Miss Curtis went back to the General Education Board and asked them to give me a scholarship separate and apart, with no strings to Municipal College, because I would make a significant contribution to librarianship in general, not just to Municipal College. They gave it to me.
Then after I got my master's degree from the University of Illinois, I went back to Louisville for one year. I had an assistant librarian there who was the wife of a local doctor. She had gotten her master's degree from Illinois, and she would not do half her work in the library. She would sit up and read, and she would leave the job and go to meetings, and go downtown, and play bridge. One day I got after her, and told her (this was after Dr. Clement had left and come to Atlanta University) that she had to stop this, and she had her job description, she had her duties to perform, and that I could not tolerate that any longer. And she said, Well, she would do what she wanted to do, and I said, "Well, you know, if you are not going to cooperate and carry your part of the load," I would have to report her to the dean. So she said that was very well, I could do that, because she would do far more over the bridge table and the cocktail glass with the dean than I would ever do officially over the dean's desk. So I said if that is so, let us go see the dean this afternoon and ask him. So I called him and got an appointment and we went in, and when we went in I found that she was right, that she could do more with the dean over the cocktail glass and the bridge table than I could do officially. So I came back that afternoon and wrote my resignation before five o'clock. I did not know where I was going, I did not have any place to go, but I knew it was my time to move, because I was not going to do all the work and she not do anything, and if she was going to work, she was going to have to do what was outlined in the procedure for her to do. So, I resigned, and that evening before he left, the dean had my resignation. I knew by that time there were more library jobs, I did not know where I would go.
The next morning when I went to work, Dr. Clement was in my office. I never will forget, he was sitting on my desk swinging his feet, and I walked in, and I said, "Dr. Clement, what are you doing in Louisville?" You see, he had come to Atlanta, and he just laughed and he said, "I came by to offer you a job." He did not know anything about what had happened the day before. He said, "At Atlanta University we are going to have a library school, and I want somebody in my employment that I can send throughout the country to﻿12
(cont.) visit other library schools to see how they are organized and put together and could do the spade work to start a library school at Atlanta University." And he said, "I have just come from Chicago, and I have talked with the people in the American Library Association, and they told me that if I plan to start a library school that I ought to have you on the staff." Then, I started asking him what he was going to pay me, and he said $1800 a year, and I said, "Well, I would like to have $2000." Anyway we laughed, and I never told him that I had resigned the day before; he did not know it.
Those summers that I worked in Louisville, I taught library science out at Prairie View College in Prairie View, Texas, where the General Education Board and the American Library Association had put together a summer program for the training of school librarians. I had been going out there for four summers, and I was head of that program in the summertime in Texas. So I finished out the school year and went on to Texas. In the meantime, the University of Louisville chancellor called me, and said they did not want me to resign from Louisville, and that they were going to get this other person to "toe the line" or get rid of her if necessary. They offered me considerable more salary to stay there, but I did not. I wanted to leave Louisville by that time. So, during the summer, Dr. Clement and I corresponded, and he agreed to pay me $2000 to come here [to Atlanta].
My first job here was head of the cataloging department in Trevor Arnett Library of Atlanta University. I worked here those two years, and President Clement sent me to visit other library schools and libraries. I went to Columbia, to New Jersey College for Women which later was merged with the Rutgers University and it is now Rutgers Library School. I went to Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh, I went to Catholic University in Washington, I went to University of North Carolina, visited the classes of a very prominent and distinguished professor by the name of Susan Grey Akers because I knew that when the library school opened that I would be teaching cataloging, and she had written a book at that time that was used in teaching cataloging in library schools. I was visiting classes at Emory University, and visited many libraries.
World War II was going on then and there were army camp libraries. We had the idea of training librarians to work with special collections in army libraries. I visited some of them, Fort Belvedere up in Virginia, and Camp Dix in New Jersey, and visited their libraries, and I got to go a lot of places to collect materials and lay the foundations for the opening of this library school.
In the meantime, the woman who had been head of the library where I took my first job in Louisville was Eliza Atkins Gleason, and she had gone on to get her doctorate in library service, and was the first black person to get a doctorate in library service. She got her doctoral degree, I think, in early '40 or '41, but I was already here, and she was employed in Talladega, and she came up﻿13
VJ: (cont.) and was appointed dean of the library school; and a man by the name of Wallace Van Jackson was hired on the faculty of the library school. I was on [the faculty of] the library school, and Eliza Gleason, so the library school was opened in the fall of '41 with just the three of us teaching and Lillie Daly Caster, who had been a friend and classmate of mine at Hampton, was the librarian and secretary. And the whole operation was done on the third floor of this building.
FB: What was happening on the other two floors?
VJ: The library was. But we did not have this wing back here. This was built in 1954. When you come through that door out there, that was the end of the building then; that library school, library, these offices, and all these were not here.
FB: This is an interview with Dean Virginia Lacy Jones of the School of Library Service, Atlanta University, on June 20, 1978. Dean Jones, why don't you tell me something about how being black and female affected the choices you could make, the career choices and other options you had.
VJ: I cannot say that being black or female had any great role to play in my choice. I never had a hangup about limitations of being female, never. My mother, I think it was because my mother was a very domineering, aggressive kind of woman, and the women in my family were strong women, and I identified with them, and it just never bothered me. I never had a feeling that being a woman was a barrier in anything I wanted to do. And, another thing—I have never sought a position; every position I have ever had has been offered to me, so I never felt the competition of vying for a position with a man. Now, one of the reasons that positions were offered to me, I think, and certainly after I got my doctorate, was because there were no men, no black men, with a Ph.D. in library science. It was a long, long time before there were any, and I was the second black person to get a Ph.D. in library science. Dr. Eliza Atkins Gleason, the first dean at this school, was the first, and I was the second. It was a long time, then,before anyone else got a doctorate in library science, so I did not feel that kind of competition.
FB: In terms of the women's movement, what attitute do you have about the women's movement? What's your opinion?
VJ: I am not too much inclined toward the women's movement. I think if women would stop going on about women, and go on and do the work they are supposed to do, they would be much better off. Now I am bothered about certain things, I am bothered about the fact that there are some women who do not get the same pay for the same job that men do. I am bothered about unfair treatment of social security and that kind of thing with women, but the women's move-﻿14
(cont.) ment tends to turn me off, and I think that one of the reasons it has is that I have seen the women's movement in operation in the American Library Association in which I have held office and been very active, and I find that the women's movement is so infiltrated by lesbians that I just cannot stand it. I do not like that at all. And I think that that has been a thing that has sort of ruined the women's cause, the cause for real women.
In particular to black women, do you think that the women's movement has anything to offer?
I still say, "If women will apply themselves and do their work, avoid being so emotional about everything that happens, and stand up for their rights, compete on an equal basis with men, that they do not have to go to the extremes that they go to." This busines about not wanting to be called "chairman," and the use of words and to be a "chairperson"—I think that is stupid. The word human has M-A-N in it, and we are human beings just like anybody else. And I just do not go along with all that. I feel that I do not want to go to war, or be a soldier or a policeman, or a state trooper, or be in a construction business, and I think biologically women are different from men, that we have different roles in terms of the family. This does not mean that you do not work outside the home, but I think women by nature are more compassionate, they are more inclined to meet the needs of people in a sympathetic and understanding way than men, and I think that is beautiful about us. And I want to maintain that element of my own femininity. I do not want to act like a man. I am not very much taken up by the women's movement, except that I want to be treated fairly as a human being. But the other parts of it just do not turn me on.
You mentioned that you had been active in the American Library Association. I know you have been active in several other library organizations, and then been dean of a university library services school. What do you think is the most important achievement that you have made?
I have gotten a lot of honors on the national level for the work that I have done. But my own feeling of achievement is a feeling of gratification for having helped and touched the lives of so many young people who come through this school, many of whom have gone on to very important and responsible positions, and are rendering a great service as professional librarians. I feel that what I have done to help them represents my greatest achievement.
What about your church? You mentioned earlier that you were involved in the church and in Sunday school, the Sunday school contest. You did not mention much else about what church you go to and about matters related to that.
Well, I was reared in the Methodist church in Clarksburg, West Virginia.﻿15
Which one?
Methodist Episcopal Church. And my mother was treasurer of that church for many years, and I went to Sunday school, and I sang in the choir although I could not sing. But when I got to college for some reason or another, I became interested in Catholicism, and I joined the Catholic church. Religion has always been a very important part of my life, and I guess I was groping for something that made religion a little more personal. That is why I was taken up with Catholicism. But I did join the Catholic church and my mother joined the Catholic church, and when I came to Atlanta and got ready to marry my husband, he was a divorced man, and for two years I contemplated whether I would marry him or not, because if I did, it meant that I had to leave the church. Finally, I decided that I would leave the church. The thing that really made me decide was that the priest told me that if I had wanted to do this before 1929, I could have done it, but canon law was changed at that time; and I felt that if that was a man-made law, I did not need to be bound by it. So I left the church, and married my husband, and we both joined the Congregational church here in Atlanta, and we have been members of that church for more than thirty years. And we have enjoyed it. My husband is very active in the church and I am beginning to be a little more active than I used to be.
But I have come to the conclusion that religion is a very personal thing, and here again, I think that you evaluate yourself as a Christian in terms of your attitudes and your behavior towards your fellow man, and I think that is what life is all about. We are here on earth for God to act through us, to carry out His will, and I do not think that the different denominations are terribly important. It is your own personal philosophy, your own personal behavior which, as long as one lives, I think, you will be measuring yourself and striving to be better. You never achieve the ultimate goal that you may set for yourself as a Christian, but you never stop working toward it.
Now, you mentioned about coming here and meeting your husband. You'have not told me much about your husband. Tell me a little more about how you met him, and when you got married...
Well, I met him when I first came to Atlanta. I came here in '39. I think I met him the second day after I got here, and we went together for two years until we were married. And he is and has been on the faculty at Morehouse College in the field of Romance languages. He was head of the modern foreign language department up until a few years ago. He is on semiretirement now; he is editor of the College Language Association Journal and he teaches one class. We had a great deal in common. I think our goals and philosophy were similar. It has been a very happy marriage.
When were you married?﻿16
VJ: In November 1941.
FB: Now, this was after you had your Ph. D.?
VJ: No, I had my master's degree. We were married in '41, and neither one of us had a doctorate at that time. We decided that if we were going to stay in the academic world we had to have that degree. So the first year we were married (we married in November), and he went off to Cornell University the following year. He had already done considerable work toward his doctorate degree, and within one year's time he had gotten his doctorate. Then he came back and I got a fellowship, and I went off to the University of Chicago. I stayed two years and got my degree, in two years flat. I went in in September '43 and got my degree in September '45. My mother went up there and lived with me and I had an apartment on campus and she stayed with me the whole time. I got my degree in September '45 and came back here as the dean of the Atlanta University School of Library Service in September '45.
FB: What about the separation as a very young couple?
VJ: Well, that was bad, but the first three years we were separated. The year he was away, he only came home at Christmastime. But the following June he was home with his degree and he used to come to Chicago to see me frequently when I was in school there. And that was our goal, and we worked towards it, and we sacrificed for it. When he went off to get his degree, he had a little car. We had to sell the car, and we had to make very drastic financial sacrifices for those three years and then when the three years were over, we had accomplished our goals.
FB: Did you have any children?
VJ: I do not have any children. My husband had two children by a previous marriage, but they never really lived with me. They went to Morehouse College and took their meals at my house, but they lived on the campus. I never had the full responsibility of the children.
FB: Did you ever want children, or how did you feel about not having any?
VJ: Well, I did in a way, and in a way I did not. Before I was married, I had three serious operations on my spine. When I went to the University of Chicago, the doctor had told me that he did not think I was physically strong enough to stand up under the strain. When I went there as a student, I went through the physical examination. I was called back to the hospital, and I thought they were going to send me back home because of my back, but instead of that, they enrolled me in the University of Chicago Clinic, and I went there twice a week, as I had a problem of walking. They thought that I was going to become crippled, and they showed my mother how to massage my back. They put me on a routine of walking every day. My mother used to walk with me, and I lost a lot of weight, and I overcame the illness at that time, but they told me that I could never﻿17
VJ: (cont.) recover from my bad back and I could never have a child. And of course, I never did. It did bother me for a while. But I was more career-minded than I was home-minded and that made it easier. But in 1965, my back went bad, and I had to have a disc removed from my spine, and at that time they thought I would not walk. I had to learn to walk all over again. And it was the kind of surgery, they told me, that could have caused me to be paralyzed. But every day of my life I take a whole routine of physical exercises, because if I did not, my back would stiffen up and I would not be able to walk. Occasionally my back hurts me and I go to the doctor and they just marvel over the fact that I have done as well as I have. But my mother used to say, "Mind over matter, do not let this get you down." "Just keep working at it." And I did. Now I have built up very strong back muscles to overcome a weak bone structure. Physically I would say I'm pretty strong, but I had been through years of constant pain with a bad back. But I have never pampered myself. I have worked many days in pain all day long and I have just decided I am not going to let it get me down. I just keep on going.
FB: How did your husband feel about it?
VJ: About my back?
FB: Well, about the children.
VJ: Well, he had two children; he was not particular about any more
children. We would have liked to have had a child of our own, but we did not.
FB: Did he ever think about adopting children?
VJ: No.
FB: You said that you were more career-minded... Than home-minded.
VJ: FB:
VJ:
...than home-minded. Did you ever feel like you had to make a choice between one or the other?
No I balanced the two of them. Sometimes it bothers me that maybe I do not do as much on one end as I ought to do, but my husband has been very supportive. He helps me with everything. I seldom go to the grocery store, he does that. I go occasionally. My mother lived with me a long time and did the cooking and managing of the house, and then my aunt lived with me for a long time and did that, but now she is ill and is in a nursing home. That has been a great emotional strain on me, but we worked things out at home very well, and from time to time I had paid help in the home. This has been a great help to me.﻿18
All right, you told me something about the travels you got to do while you were beginning the school here. Tell me about some of your other travels.
Well, when I first started working in the library school, we had a grant from the General Education Board to serve in an advisory capacity for the development of school libraries in small towns and rural areas throughout the South. And Mrs. Hallie Brooks, who was on the faculty, traveled through Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and during that time I traveled through Tennessee and Kentucky, Virginia, North and South Carolina. School principals or teachers would write to request consultant services for their school. Mrs. Brooks or I would visit with the librarians or the teachers and the principal about how to get started in developing school libraries. Sometimes they were schools that were K [kindergarten] through 12, sometimes they were elementary schools, sometimes they were just high schools. And the travel experience during the days of segregation, going into these small towns, I could write a book about it. It was terrific. After about two years, we discontinued that because so often we went into these small towns and all they had was the idea of a library. They had no money, no trained people, and no facilities. They just wanted to have a library. Then we started having conferences and workshops here to bring those people to Atlanta University for training.
I traveled quite a bit through my activities with the American Library Association, throughout the whole United States. When I was teaching in Prairie View, Texas, I went to Mexico. I have been to Canada several times, once on a pleasure trip and once to a professional meeting. In 1954, before Castro took over Cuba, my husband and I spent a vacation period in Havana, Cuba. In 1952, we went to Europe together. We went to Paris and London, Rome and Florence, and then we visited some other cities in France. In 1958, we spent the whole summer in Europe. We went to Scotland and England, Belgium, to the World's Fair in Brussels, we went to Germany, to Switzerland, to Italy and Spain. And we went to Africa last year, fall of '76 we went to Senegal in West Africa. And I have been down in the Caribbean islands several times.
What was the most significant place you have been, or the place that meant more to you?
Well, I do not know. There are a lot of places. From a point of view'of pure pleasure, I think I enjoyed going to Sorrento and Naples, in Italy, and the island of Capri off the coast of Italy. From a'more serious point of view, I enjoyed the trip to Senegal in West Africa. We were invited as the guests of the president of Senegal to celebrate his seventieth birthday, which was done as an international conference of people from thirty-nine countries. That was a marvelous experience. We met many black writers from African countries. We met people from Europe, Asia, and South America. It was a very thrilling experience. We were entertained by the U.S.﻿19
VJ: (cont.) ambassador, whose sister had been a classmate of mine in college, and I knew him when he was a little boy, and that was very nice. I know that I have enjoyed all of the experiences that we had in foreign travels, and these were the highlights.
FB: In terms of community organizations, civil rights groups, or sororities , what have you been involved in?
VJ: Well, I belong to the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, but a long time ago I stopped being affiliated with it, simply because I did not have the time to spread myself so thin. I used to work with them on a special project they had in getting a bookmobile started down in Carrollton, Georgia. I was very active in the sorority at that time, but the job as dean of this library school has just consumed all of my time, because I have had to raise a lot of the money to operate the school I have been very successful in getting the money from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, and from the federal government. I have had many offices in the American Library Association. For six years I was secretary-treasurer of the Association of American Library Schools, which involved all the accredited library schools in the United States and Canada, and I was the editor of the publications they put out at that time. I served on a lot of committees of the American Library Association, and for five years was on the executive board of the American Library Association.
FB: That is like the organization of library people. Was there any problem about blacks getting into that?
VJ: Not getting into it. They were among the first of the professional organizations t© welcome blacks and give them opportunity to take part in it, awi I have been very active with it since 1946. When Lyndon Johnson was president, he appointed me to the National Advisory Committee on Library Education and Research, and I used to go to Washington quite a bit in that capacity. I have just finished a term on the Fulbright-Hays Fellowships for Foreign Study, which is under the U.S. Department of State, and I have worked with them for several years. I used to be on the Federal Relations Committee of the American Library Association, the legislation committee, the Intellectual Freedom Committee, and I have been very active with the Association of College and Research Libraries. In nineteen years of my profession, I served on the Council of the American Library Association, which is the policy-making group. So that, with all those commitments, I could just not spread myself out to do a lot of things in the community, and I have given all I have to this school and to the American Library Association.
Now 1 have gotten a number of prestigious awards from the American Library Association. The first one was the Melvil Dewey Award, which is given for outstanding and distinguished service in the library profession. That was given to me in Las Vegas, Nevada, in the summer of 1973. Then there is a Black Caucus, made of the black﻿20
VJ: (cont.) members of the Association, and they give an annual award for outstanding service, and I think it was about two years ago that I got that. Also two years ago, I was made an honorary member of the American Library Association, which is the highest award of the Association, and I have a huge plaque at home, with a large citation on it. You might like to see that. Then last year, I thought they were through giving me awards but I got what is known as the J. Lippincott Award, which came with a medal. I do not know if you noticed, on my academic robe I wear the ribbon and a golden medal. That is the Lippincott Award. It also included a check for a thousand dollars. Now I have had enough of that.
FB: You do not want any more awards? [laughs]
VJ: Well, there are plenty of people who deserve those same awards. They are nice, I guess.
FB: What about hobbies? What do you do in your spare time, if you have any?
VJ: Well, I like to play the organ. We have an organ in our home. And I like to do needlepoint work. I used to knit a lot, but I do not do that any more. But my most recent hobby is needlepoint. I like to do needlepoint. And of course I read a lot, when I have time.
FB: Do you ever play for church, or anything like that?
VJ: No, I used to. When I was in high school I used to play at church and used to play the piano. We used to have silent movies when I was in high school, and I used to play the piano for the silent movies.
FB: On another issue which you might address yourself to, teenage
pregnancy is a problem that especially affects the black community. What are your opinions about this whole area of illegitimacy that faces the black community?
VJ: Well, I think that one of the things is that black families are
not strong enough, and I think black and white families, families in general, are too permissive with children in this day and age. We're too permissive with people in schools. Children are brought up to do what they want to do when they want to do it, and if they want, to do it. And I was not brought up that way. I see so many parents who, you know, at the age of four, they have to do certain things that their children demand. Well, of course I was never brought up that way, and I think that parents make a mistake doing that. And children have anything they want. They get to do anything they want, and if they want the sensation of sex, that is just another thing they want, without really understanding what they are doing. I think the media has a lot to do with it in that children are exposed to everything. I do not think they need to be brought up in ignorance. I think a lot of this comes about because they really do not understand what they are getting into.﻿21
VJ: (cont.) And they do not have enough supervision because parents have to work. And it is a real, real hard-core problem. If people grow up without a sense of values, and everybody thinks that, "Whatever I want, I have got to have now," they are not willing to make any sacrifices for waiting till a later time when they really know what they are doing, or know what problems are involved with what they are doing. I think that is one of our major social problems, and I just do not know what to do. The answer is, I think, it all stems from a lack of home training and very often the home training is not there because of the economic status of the family. The parents are not there with the children, and then so many of the children are really not wanted. Relatively few people have children they want. I think, and I may be wrong about it, but I think that is true. The children get to be a burden. The parents want to live their lives, so they neglect the children.
FB: You mentioned that you got married in 1941, right? You were about twenty-nine years old then.
VJ: Oh, let's see... Yes, I was twenty-nine.
FB: Were you ever afraid that perhaps you would not get married? You know, in our day people are delaying marriages longer, but then I would suspect that people were already writing you off as an old maid, as it were, or whatever.
VJ: I did not think that, because I could have gotten married a long time ago. I just did not see anybody I really wanted.
FB: Did you always want to get married, or were you willing to say,
well, if the right person never came along you were willing to do without?
VJ: Oh, I always figured the right person would come around; I never entertained the thought of not getting married. I used to often say that I wanted to be a career woman, and I was going to get married on my lunch hour and go on back to work. And I almost did. We decided to get married on Sunday; we got married on Thursday, which was Thanksgiving Day. I took the weekend off and came back to work Monday. So it was pretty much like I had thought it would be. From a little girl, I used to say, "I am going to get married on my lunch hour because I am going to have a job." And I almost did.
We are here today at the School of Library Service with Dean Virginia Lacy Jones, on October 10, 1978. Dean Jones, how are you today? Doing pretty good? Before, when we talked, you told me about your parents, and about your growing-up years, and about some of the things you accomplished in your lifetime and in your career. You said that you would tell me some more about some of your experiences in terms of the racial situation as you were growing up. Could you begin to share some of those things with me?﻿22
VJ: Well, I grew up in a neighborhood that was made up of black people, white people, and Italian people. My playmates when I was quite young were for the most part white, but as we grew older and began to do things socially, we did not play together as much. I began to realize the differences in race, and began to develop friends among black children with whom I went to school And the earlier associations with children in the neighborhood grew further and further apart, because there were many places they could go that I could not go. You know this was quite obvious. I grew up in Clarksburg, West Virginia, where there was no segregation in the public library, and I was free to use the public library. Not many black children in the community used the library, but I used it because I was encouraged to do so by my mother.
I had several experiences there that I remember very vividly. The Ku Klux Klan was very active in this little town, and this to me was a rather frightening thing. I remember that they had a state convention of the Ku Klux Klan to meet there, and they had a parade, and my mother took to see the parade, and I was amazed to find out that there was a women's auxiliary among the Ku Klux Klan, and the women marched. I remember very vividly a woman with one leg walking in that parade on crutches. I do not know why that had always stuck in my mind, but it has.
In the church that I attended, which was the Trinity Methodist Church, I sang in the junior choir. My mother was the treasurer of the church, and the church was having severe financial difficulties because of a mortgage that they had, and they were desperately trying to raise money to save the church to pay off the mortgage. One morning during a church service, a white man opened the door and walked in the church up to the altar and handed the minister a piece of paper, and he left. The minister looked at it, and he read it, and it was a note saying that at the Sunday evening service a hundred members of the Ku Klux Klan would come to the service, donate money to help them pay off the mortgage of the church, and they wished to assemble in the basement of the church and put on their robes, and when they entered the sanctuary they would like for the choir to sing "Onward Christian Soldier." They had a church meeting immediately after the service, and there was a great deal of discussion of whether they should take it or not take it.
FB: A black church?
VJ: A black church. And they finally said the money was owed to white people, many of the members of that church worked for white people in the community, and they knew many of the people who had businesses, and that black people spent money with those businesses, and if they wanted to give the church the money to save the church from its impending loss, that they felt like they ought to take it. Well, I was just frightened, and my mother took this attitude: "We owe the money to white people. White people have always oppressed us. If they want to give us some money to save this church, we will take it." Well, that night the junior choir was to sing, and I was to be in the choir, and I did not want to go, but my mother said, "Yes, you are going. You are going to hold your head up high and﻿23
VJ: (cont.) sing and they are going to give that money and you think it is no more than what it deserves."
The word got over the little town, and the little street that the church was on was lined by people on both sides watching these white people come in, and they went in the basement of the church to put on their robes, and at the time they designated they came to the sanctuary with an American flag and a Ku Klux Klan flag, and they marched to the front of the church, and spread out across the altar, and one man stepped forward and made the speech about how they were in favor of things that were positive in the community, and this was a good group of Christian people that were making a worthwhile contribution to the community, and they were pleased to give this money to pay off this mortgage. And they put cash money down on the table in front of the lectern, and they turned and marched out, some of them just went out in back of the church, took their robes, and came back and stayed for the Sunday evening service. And when they did that, there were enough of them that we recognized. One	man who had the grocery store in our
neighborhood from whom we bought our groceries, and another that I remember was the man who owned the cleaning and pressing place where we got clothes cleaned. I said to my mother, "I do not ever want to buy anthing there any more. I do not want to take my clothes there to be cleaned," and Mother said that there was no black grocery store, there was not any black cleaning and pressing place, and those two people had always been very friendly and nice to us. So my mother said, "Just go on and act as if nothing ever happened." This was a difficult thing to do. But we did it, and nothing happened. And the church paid its mortgage, and they had a burning of the mortgage. I think that is an unusual story, but that did happen.
FB: Did the Klan ever try to terrorize the black community in any way?
VJ: No, not to my knowledge. But they did preach racial hatred, and
we knew that. And they were very anti-Catholic and Jews and blacks. But in that particular town, to my knowledge, they used to burn crosses, but they did not burn them in people's yards. In that town there were two very high hills—I would not call them mountains. One was Loundes Hill and the other one was Pinnapenick, and often we would look out at night and we could see the tops of these hills from where we lived, and there would be burning a cross on that hill, and that would terrorize people. There may have been other incidents that terrorized individuals; however, I do not remember anything of that kind. These were rather traumatic experiences for a young person. They bothered me and I think they are vividly etched in my memory.
Now, the worst racial experience that I ever had was when I was a student at the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois. I was there on a fellowship from the General Education Board to work towards the master's degree. There were no dormitories that black students could live in, so we had to find housing in the homes of black people who lived in that community. I happened to have a friend, who went there at the same time I did to study, who had an﻿24
VJ: (cont.) aunt who was married to a man who had a very large cleaning and pressing establishment in the immediate university community, and I lived there. We got our breakfast there, and we got our dinner there, but we did not get our lunch there. At the time I went to University of Illinois, students, black students, could not eat in any drugstores or restaurants or anything of that sort in Urbana, Illinois. In the moving pictures theater, you had to sit in the balcony. It was a very prejudiced place. First place, when you went to the University of Illinois, it was made quite clear to you that the faculty felt that black students were definitely inferior to white students, and their expectations of the academic performance would not be on the level with the white students. I felt this all the time.
I remember that I took a cataloging class. We had to do a special project in subject headings, and the teacher suggested to me that I do a project on subject headings related to Negroes, because we did not use the term black at that time. And I said to her, "There is a Mrs. Frances Yocum, the cataloger at Fisk University who has just published a comprehensive subject heading list to guide cata-logers in the cataloging of books by and about Negroes. And it would be a waste of time to do that over again, and I would prefer to do my project on the subject heading dealing with Labor and Laboring Classes." She said to me very curtly, "Oh, I can understand why you would not want to do that. I sometimes want to forget that I am of English descent," implying that I wanted to forget that I was black. Her name was Miss Bond.
The white students in the master's degxee program were not very friendly, and they were particularly curious about me, because I am fair of complexion. They used to ask me all kinds of questions about my background. Why was I fair? And why did I have hair just like their hair? One day a woman walked up to me in the library and took her hand and lifted my haiT up and felt it, and she said, "I just do not understand why your hair is just like mine and you are a Negro." And without thinking I just said, made this ugly statement to her, and I said, "Oh, that is because I am the daughter of a well-to-do white woman, and my father was her chauffeur, and I was reared in a Catholic convent." And she turned red and looked at me and she never said anything more to me after that. And I said that because I knew that white people would not like for a man-woman relationship to be between a white woman and a black man. I am sure she knew later that I was lying, but I did not take time to think that up, I just said it- And she turned purple.
Another thing happened there, as is customary in any graduate program, is that the dean of the library school had a Sunday afternoon tea for the students in the School of Library Science. At that time, there were two black students- It so happened that both of us were of fair complexion, one was brown, but neither one of us was invited. And we did not know that they had the tea until the next day. We heard the other students talking about how Mr. Winsor had entertained the library school students at his home the preceeding Sunday. When I went to the University of Illinois, the﻿25
VJ: (cont.) Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, with the assistance of a
lawyer from Chicago—I cannot think of his name right now—but he was sent there by the NAAC? in Chicago to help combat the racial situation in terms of black students not being able to eat in restaurants. So they planned one Sunday afternoon that some white students, white men and black men, would go to a restaurant together, and go and be seated and see if they would be served. They refused to serve them. They told them that all the food was gone and they did not have any more food. They made all kinds of excuses and they just let them sit there. They sat there all the rest of the day, and, to prove their case, they heard the manager tell them not to serve them.
FB: What year was this?
VJ: Nineteen thirty-six, I believe.
FB: This was a sit-in long before the civil rights days of the 1960s.
VJ: Oh, yes. So, after that, of course, with the assistance of this lawyer, they filed a suit, because Illinois had passed a law, a civil rights act for equal rights and that kind of thing. And there were thirteen thousand students on that campus, and there were 105 black students the year I was there. And we organized. This came up in a court case, and we went to the court. It was my first experience in a courtroom in my life, and I was just amazed at what happened. They put the white waitresses on the stand, and they testified that these black students came into the restaurant and tried to attack them. And that is why they did not serve them. Well, of course the black students gave their testimony and the white fellows that went with them gave their testimony which refuted what they had said. They also tried to prove in their testimony that they were out of food, and that they did not refuse to serve them because they were black, but because they did not have food, and because these black students tried to attack the white female waitresses. Well, anyway, at the end of the day, it was declared, the case was dropped on the basis that they were not refused food because they were black, and that black students had the right to eat in the restaurants. The NAACP lawyers that came down from Chicago told us not all to go to the same restaurants after this hearing, at the same time, but to scatter about and go in the various restaurants.
Well, that particular night we divided into small groups and went to various restaurants, and they had a man on the door of every restaurant around that campus, and when you started in, he asked you if you had a reservation, and if you told him no, he said, "We're only taking people by reservation." After that, in this particular restaurant—I think it was called Pren's, was the name of that restaurant—the next day when black students went to that restaurant, they served them food, but the food had in it long﻿26
(cont.) black hairs. It was just mixed up with long hairs, like hairs from a horse's tail. We were pretty sure that was what it was. Of course the food was not edible, and of course we walked out. They did that for several days, and then we reported this to the state health board, and then the next week when black students went in this restaurant, which was the most popular campus restaurant, they served the food, and when you got through eating, the waitress would come and push the dishes on the floor and break them up right in front of you. So we said, "Boy, that's beautiful. We'll just make them break up all the dishes they've got," and for three days they broke up those dishes.
Now in the meantime, the NAACP people came back from Chicago, and we wrote to the state health department to get some action on this kind of thing. But this type of thing would happen: If you would go in a drugstore or restaurant and buy a sandwich or a piece of pie, they would make you pay for it, and then when you got the sandwich and bit down into it, there was a thick layer of salt, iust as thick as this pencil. And under the pie crust they would put the salt. I arm a Coca-Cola fiend, and one time 1 went in and asked for a fountain coke, and they mixed the coke with kosher pickle juice. There was a young man there who was working in a Ph.D. program at the University of Illinois in chemistry, and he went in one day and got a glass of milk and tasted it, and realized it had carbolic acid in it. So he took it immediately to the laboratory and analyzed it and sent a report to the health department, and then they said that he could have put the carbolic acid in there when he left the store.
So all during the year that I was there, we were fighting this kind of thing, and the restaurant people organized and said that they did not mind serving black students, but they had to think in terms of their business. Would the white students come in a restaurant and eat where black students were eating? So we organized a little speakers' bureau, and various ones of us went to church groups in the city- We went to fraternity and sorority houses of the white people. We went to the club groups. We went to every group we could go to and presented our case, because they were going to have a vote in the university as to whether the students would patronize restaurants if they were serving blacks. I made several speeches to various groups about this. The human rights element of it, what Mack students wanted, and it came out very close in favor of the Negroes eating there, but was not an overwhelming vote in favor of this..
The other thing, the only place that we could eat lunch on the campus was the ho®e economics building. They served lunch there every day. Of course as studeuts there, they could not refuse us, but if we went in the cafeteria and sat down to the tables that seated about eight people, if there were four or five other people there very frequently when we sat down they would all get up and move,'or stand up with their plates, because they were showing that they did not want to eat with us. During the height of all of this, when I was going around as part of the little speakers'﻿27
VJ: (cont.) bureau we had, one night I left the library—I studied in the library every night I was there because I was so unhappy and I wanted to get my degree as fast as I could and get away from there—and as I came out of the library one night going to where I lived, alone, there were a bunch of white fellows standing there, and they said, "There she is." They said, "She's a good person to cut up in three parts and hang her body up. She's a Catholic, she looks like a Jew, and she's a nigger." Well, I was so frightened, I ran back in the library, and there was one white girl in that library school who was friendly to me, and I told her what happened, and I cried, and said, "I am afraid to go outside of this building." And you did not feel that there was anybody there who would be helpful to you. So she said, "Virginia, let's see if we can find some other black students, maybe some men in the library." And we did, we found three or four of them, and I told them, and they said, well, if I just waited a little while, they would walk home with me. And we did not go down the main street where all the students go. We went kind of on a back side street.
Along about May or the latter part of April, the NAACP had gotten the state health department to set up an office in Urbana, and directions were sent to us from NAACP that when we went to restaurants or drugstores to buy food we should always go in twos, so that if the food was not edible, one person could call the health department and the other would stay there with the food, because every time we reported this contaminated food, they would say we did it after we left the restaurant. But you see, by this time the school year was about over.
Another thing that happened during that year—there were a lot of Communist students on that campus who were in favor of the black cause and wanted to help us. And many mornings when I came out going to class, one or two of them would be standing out there, saying to come up and sit-in with them all day, because they were going to a certain restaurant, and taking their own lessons, and just sit there all day. Well, I was torn between two things. I was on a General Education Board fellowship, and I knew that money was given to me to get my degree and to prepare me to work. The reason they gave it to me was to work in a black college. They were very hard. They went out of their way to be very hard on black students, and sometimes required more of you in class than they did of other students. And I had to take the stand that I could not do this. I had to go to class, and I did my class work and my thesis all that year. That is why I stayed in the library all day. I stayed there every night because I wanted to get away from that place as fast as I could. And I felt very guilty about not doing it, and they did not like me because I did not do it, but I said to them, "I have got to go to class. I have got to use this time to study, because my one aim in life is to get this degree and get the heck out of here." Well, that was a hard decision that I felt guilty about. Here were white students, and I did not want to be connected with Communism either, although I appreciated their taking the attitude. But I felt like this, I cannot align myself with them, because they stand for other principles I do not like,﻿28
VJ: (cont.) and my best bet is to prove that I am a good student, good enough to get out of here. And I was, I think, about the first student in that graduate library school that did all that work in a nine-month period, and I got my degree.
When I left there, my feeling was,"I do not ever want even to fly over this campus in an airplane." I have been invited back there sometimes but I would never go. It was hard for me. I thought I was in the state of Illinois, where I felt that there would be some freedom. I was glad to come back down South. Now segregation was going on, but the difference was that up there you were supposed to have rights, but really you did not. Down here you knew what you could do and what you could not do.
I was called in by the director of the library school just before graduation, and he caught himself complimenting me on the fact that I was one of the best black students he had ever had any contact with, and I found this insulting. I did not want to be the best black student that he had come in contact with, T wanted to be a good student, period. And of course, it was just the day before commencement, something like that, and I told him that, and he looked real funny and turned real red, and said, "You know that you are a good student. It's just, you see, that we haven't had many black students." He indicated that he had not expected any quality. So that really was my most difficult time with racial discrimination.
FB: You said that there was one incident in your childhood with one of your playmates that made you realize things were different [between the races] even though you had grown up together.
VJ: Well, I knew that we could not go to the movies together, because whites sat downstairs and I had to go upstairs. When they-~the whites—first said, "Let's go to the movies," my mother said no. I said, "Well, we play together, why can we not go to the movies together?" My mother then began to tell me things like, "It would just be better not to go," because this was a form of segregation you did not have to accept. She tried to provide a lot of things for me in my own home. I took piano lessons. My mother taught me to sew and knit. I can embroider. I can crochet. My mother used to say, "You need to learn to do things on your own, creative type things, where you could get your own pleasure and enjoyment." And I had a lttle garden. My mother had a big garden, but one little part of this garden was mine. Mother did a whole lot of things to try to interest me, to try to keep me from wanting to do these kinds of things.
FB: How did she explain to you about racial differences? Did you feel bad about youself, and about having to go to the balcony?
VJ: Yes, I did feel bad, and my mother said that the kind of thing you went to the movies to see, you could very well do without. You could go to the public library and get some books to read, because﻿29
VJ: (cont.) it was not segregated. And I think that it was because of my experiences doing this that I found that I wanted to be a librarian, or I began to think about being a librarian. The white librarians in that library took a very special interest in me, and were very nice. And I used to get in arguments with them. I would want to get books from the adult side, and they would tell you to get books from the children's side. Sometimes I used to try to slip books from the adult side, and they would say no. Back in those days they were very strict about what children could read, and what adults could read. That used to be a real game with me, to see if I could slip out some books from the adult side, [laughter] I think that my mother must have done a very beautiful job of that, because she never instilled real hatred in me towards white people. But she kept trying to say that you have to develop your own character, your own principles. You have to stand up for what you think is right. And this is where I got the idea that it is better to be oppressed than to be the oppressor. My mother would say that the kinds of things white people do to black people are sinful and wrong. "Would you rather be in that position and doing these sinful, wrong things? For that reason you can feel superior to them, and you can rise above them. You do not let them tamper with your inner feelings about your own person." And as I look back on it, it was a feeling of, "You are better than they are, because you do not stoop to do to other human beings what they do." And this has seen me through a whole lot of things. And, right now, I actually feel it is wrong to be oppressed, but it is worse to be the oppressor.
And in my lifetime, and in that neighborhood, there were some white people who were very nice to me, and who were very friendly to me. I know when I went to college there was a white woman in my neighborhood who made a little quilt for me to take with me. They gave me gifts when I went away to college. And I would always go to see them when I came back. And, even today, if I go to Clarksburg, most of them are dead, but the few that are living I always go to see.
You know, I mentioned first about being in the Methodist church. Well, I was Methodist until after I finished high school. Then I joined the Catholic church. And of course through my college days, I was a Catholic until I married. I married a man who had been divorced, and for this reason could not remain in the Catholic church.
When I went to Louisville on my first job, there was a Catholic church near where I lived. And I used to go there. On the back row of seats they had a little sign on the arm of the pew that said, "Reserved for Coloreds." I got myself a little screwdriver, and I went in the church while the service was going on and I sat back there; as folks were kneeling and praying, I unscrewed those little signs and threw them away. The signs stayed off a long, long time, and after three or four months I went back there and the signs were there. I slipped in there several times to do it again, but there was always somebody else in there and I never did it any more. [laughs] And most of the time I did not sit in the back, and they never said anything.﻿30
FB: Did they have any black congregations?
VJ: In the Catholic church? Yes, they did in Louisville, but it was quite a long distance from where I lived.
When I came to Atlanta University, I was active in the American Library Association, and there was the Georgia Library Association. There was also a separate state library association for blacks, as we could not belong to the Georgia Library Association. I applied for membership in the Georgia Library Association and sent the annual membership dues. I received a letter stating that there was no provision in the Association for me to become a member. The membership dues were returned to me. But, there was a young man, E. J. Josey, at Savannah State College, who kept the protest up, and the Georgia Library Association as a chapter was dropped from the American Library Association. After, [in] 1954, the Association changed its constitution to admit Negroes and I finally joined. When I was in Louisville, Kentucky, black people could not belong to the Kentucky Library Association. I helped to organize the Kentucky state professional organization of black librarians. The formerly all-white state association also began after 1954 to accept black members. About eight or nine years ago, I was invited to the Kentucky Library Association as their guest banquet speaker. They have come a long way. Now Negroes are fully integrated into the Georgia Library Association, and in all the southern state library associations. There was a lot of segregation in the South, and I helped to protest that, to move them away from segregation.
At one time the Southeastern Library Association had a meeting here in Atlanta on library education, training librarians. And it was for all the colleges and universities in the Southeast ehat were giving courses in library science. They got the money to have this conference from the General Education Board, but they were having it at the Biltmore Hotel where we could not go. So I wrote the General Education Board, because they were giving money to support this conference, and said I did not think they knew that they were supporting a professional meeting which black library educators could not attend. I never will forget when they came out here to ask me (they knew I had protested) if I would be satisfied if they had one session of the meeting out here on the Atlanta University campus. We got into the hotel, but when we got there we could not go to any of the meals and so they agreed not to have meetings in connection with meals. We were told that we could not go beyond the mezzanine floor. We had to use the restrooms that were used by the help. So we went there, but at noon we had to come back on this side of town and get lunch and then go back, and it was a very humiliating thing to have to go down to the basement to the janitor's quarters to go to the restroom, or feel that you could not ride up the elevator. And then we would go back to the meeting and they would refer to something that had taken place in a meeting dur ing a meal. And the next time there was a. library association meet ing, we had it here in Atlanta.
