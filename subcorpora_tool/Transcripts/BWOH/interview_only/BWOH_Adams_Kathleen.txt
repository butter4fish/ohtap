We are at 970 Palmetto Avenue in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 30, 1976. Mrs. Adams, would you give us your full name, including your maiden name, please.
I was christened Wilmere Kathleen Redding, and I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, July 11, 1890. I happened to have been born on what was considered Atlanta's most prominent Negro street, Auburn Avenue. The residential section in which I was born was called Negro Peachtree. The people on that strip were very intelligent and very aspiring; they helped to make Atlanta. We had living next door to us—he came when I was five years old— Bishop L.H. Holsey, who was a founder of the CME' Church. And then another bishop out of the same denomination came to live with us. We had a man on the corner who was a finished shoemaker, came out of slavery being able to make fine handmade shoes.
So this is what he did when he was a slave?
When he was a slave. He must have been around thirty-five years old when he was freed. Because he was in the same age group of my paternal grandmother. That would give me an idea of his age. And then also, he was the man that set up the deacon board, the first deacon board of the First Congregational Church. So we had quite a number of people. We had a man that came out of slavery a finished plasterer, and he did work on the more influential houses on the north side of the city. And, oh, we just had a number of them, but it's probably not necessary to tell each one right now.
But going back, as I said, I was born on that strip, and of course that made me have aspirations also. I was put into kindergarten when I was about three years old. My mother had been in one of the first classes that had been taught, the kindergarten training at the old Storr School. And she and her class, some of her classmates, secured the services

KA: (cont.) of a Miss Robinson from the Northwest where the AMA* had been working with the Indians, more or less.
MR: Here in Atlanta?
KA: No, in Wisconsin.
MR: Oh, I see.
KA: Yes, in Wisconsin. Miss Robinson came down with her mother, and they
were definitely of Indian background. You could see the mother, particularly, was just like a squaw. And we had a wonderful time at Miss Robinson's kindergarten. Oh, I suppose about fifteen of us. The mothers who had been in the Storr School were having the little ones come along, and they'd take great pains, some to come from across town, and bring the children.
MR: Where was the Storr School located?
KA: The Storr School was in the middle of the block on Houston Street, between
Courtland and Piedmont, about 600 feet to the east of the First Congregational Church, as we know it now. We, as little ones, went to the kindergarten, to Miss Robinson, and most of us did attend the Sunday school of the First Congregational Church because that was the church that had been established by the Storr School in about 1865. We went to the day school. Some of us continued going to the Storr School, and some of us branched out and went to the city public school. It had been established several years after the Storr School.
MR: So this was in 18...
KA: The Atlanta public school system was established in 1872. And Storr in 1865.
MR: Did you go to separate schools?
KA: Oh yes, schools here were separate.
MR: And how far did you go? I mean, like, was it seventh grade, eighth grade?
KA: Oh, going back, I went to the public school. My father [stated] that the girls were finishing from Atlanta University. They should be given some of the children to instruct. Not just because the parents went to the Storr School to continue us in the Storr, because Storr was a private school. So I went to the Gate City School; the formal name was Houston Street Public School, which was operated by the Atlanta Board of Education. I entered there about 1898, and I went through eight grades there, finishing in June of 1906. From there, I went to Atlanta University, entering September 1906, about one week after the Atlanta riot. And I remained in Atlanta University and graduated from the normal course, which was the course then for young women who had in mind working in the schoolroom. And I finished there June 1, 1911.

American Missionary Association﻿3
KA: (cont.) From there, with the wonderful training that I had at Atlanta University, and the encouragement of my parents, I was able to go into the teaching profession as a full-fledged teacher without doing any supply or supernumerary work. I taught at the Roach Street School, which was at the corner of Roach and Greensferry. I was there for around twelve years, and then I married. At that time, when you married, that meant your resignation. The Atlanta board did not employ married teachers at that time. So I became a housewife and for twelve years I stayed in the home and cared for it. Then I was asked to help in the Fulton County system, and I did for seventeen years as a general supply teacher.
MR: Mrs. Adams, you mentioned that there were several ex-slaves who lived in
your neighborhood when you were a young girl. What about your own family? Did you have any mentioning of slavery in your own family?
KA: Oh yes. My people on both sides, maternal and paternal, were on large
plantations right here in Georgia. My maternal grandmother's family was on the plantation of John Hester Graves. Now that was in Washington, Georgia. Wilkes County; Washington-Wilkes, it's usually called. They were English people that had a literary background. The Graves family produced one governor for Alabama, and also an editor for one of the Birmingham newspapers. He had considerable fame here in Georgia. He was John Temple Graves, who edited the Birmingham paper. My grandmother's mother, my great-grandmother, was a mulatto from that family. When she was eighteen years old, the family started a hope chest for her, and in traveling to Europe, they brought back what she called a "fisher." And it's just like the scarves, and the size of the scarves that we use now. And I'm happy to say that I have that scarf that was brought back for her hope chest now. Which would make it, of course, nearly on to 200 years old.
MR: Oh, my. I hope you will permit us to see it sometime.
KA: Oh yes, I had it out the other day. They seem to have been very fond of
her, and when it was time for her to marry, this Graves, who I always just like to say was her sire, went to the Richmond block. He had heard of some slaves that had been brought in. He went to this block, because they said that they were rather intelligent people. The underground gave the information that they had been given to the ship captain, three young men, to bring to Atlanta—not to Atlanta, to America—to learn the ways that the colored people who returned to Africa had picked up in America.
There's a little joke maybe connected with that, where my brother and I were concerned, when my grandmother would tell that tale. We'd say, "Grandmother, the colored people did not go back to Africa; don't you see them walking the streets here every day?" We were eight and ten years old and we didn't exactly understand. I knew it all, because I was carrying the big geography from the fourth grade at that time, and I just knew all about the countries across the sea, and Grandmother had never been to school, and we knew she just didn't know what she was talking about. But we found out later, in her talk and with her talk; at least I found out later.﻿4
KA: (cont.) But she was dead and gone when I found it out, and realized that when she talked of her father, and used some of the expressions that he used, that he had had contact with the French language. In going back with the aid of Mr. Webster, who was the principal of the AU high school department, when he was writing his thesis, he said he had noticed something about two students there in the school who he wanted to use as the guinea pigs in his thesis. One was out of the Hawes family, several sisters having graduated from Atlanta University, and one was in my class, and of course I was there, so he began coming out to the home, talking with my mother. And when they really got into it, found out that this fellow that he purchased...he purchased the three of them because they made such an ado about parting, that he just couldn't see to part them. He brought all three of them back down to Washington, Georgia, and it was supposed that they were princes from Ghana. Now when my grandmother would reprimand us as children, she used the same thing that he used. She'd throw a hand up, "Sahh! Sani a ghana," and we knew that we were either too loud or our manners weren't just the thing they should be. That had been his way of telling her and her sisters and one brother that they were supposed to be dignified. They were supposed to set examples, and they were never to be rude to anyone. And that was a law in my family, never be rude to anyone. You can't afford to be rude. So as I say, I had to get grown and study languages to understand some of her expressions.
Now she had one that came to me the other day, this late in life. She used to say that her grandfather had traveled across the big sea. Well, we understood that he went across the Mediterranean and that he went to Mali. Oh, here last year I think it was, I read a novel on Mali and it came to me. I said, "Well now, this is the land that he is supposed to have visited." And then, the other day, as I worked around here, something came to me that she used to say, "He went 'cool' in Mali." And she would say it in the broad way, it sounded more like "coal" than "cool," and I remember my brother, who was a tease, said, "Why'd he go away where it was cold? Why didn't he stay where it was warm?" And it dawned upon me what she was saying, that he said he went to ecole; when they asked him how could he keep the accounts of the farm, he said he'd been to ecole. And it dawned upon me what she was trying to say and what he was saying to her, was the French word for school. That's where he had gotten his training. And it's wonderful to me now...of course Grandmother died when I was fifteen, and just at that age you know, oh, so much and know nothing. I didn't realize, and I don't think she realized just what her grandfather was trying to tell her. Now she said when he got to the place, when he was in his last illness, he kept begging for them to take him to his 'pot.' Take him to his 'pot.' Well, as I say, this teasing brother of mine said, "Well, why didn't they take him up and sit him on it?" And so it came to me sometime ago, now what he was saying, he wanted to go back to his country. He said his father told him to come back to his 'pot'**. And I just wished I had had just a little more understanding. I probably could have gotten so much along that line from her.
But I have been interested in Ghana, and one of my customers—I sew—went
Atlanta University ** patrie (French for country)﻿5
KA: (cont.) to Ghana the summer before last. She brought me back that cap
of Ghana. That's just a half of it up there. She kept half and brought me the other half, had me cut it in half and we halved it. And so I keep something to remind me of my African heritage before me all the time. And my brother was interested in African culture, and I miss him so much because we had so much that we could write and exchange and find things and share it...
MR: Were there just the two of you?
KA: Four. Two boys and two girls. But I don't know, my brothers were closer to me than the sister. We seem to have liked the same thing. Our tendencies all seem to have gone on to the historical side of things. Actually, my sister became a historian also. She taught history in Richmond, Virginia, in the high school there. So we all were interested in history. In fact, our father and mother, that was one of their interests, because my father was a mathematician, and my mother in her school days evidently had a leaning to English. She was very much interested in poetry, and the English poets particularly. She took them all in; she was the type of mother that observed the quiet hour in the afternoon, and in that hour she gathered us around her and she read poetry to us. And I think that's where I get the tendency to jot the little things down in a poetic line. So our bringing up from that maternal side was, well, I'll just have to say, it was of a very good culture.
MR: It sounds as though it was. Now, what did your father do? You said he was a mathematician. Did he teach school?
KA: No, he didn't. He was a teller-cashier in one of the major banks. He
handled the Negro accounts. Maybe before you leave, I'll let you see the picture that he liked best of himself. May I start back with the grandmother, his mother?
MR: Please do.
KA: His mother was on a plantation in southwest Georgia, and the name of the man was Pom Redding. I suppose it was "Pompey." But he always said, "the Pom Redding plantation." It was somewhere near Columbus, Georgia, in Stewart County. That was a plantation that was handled very intelligently, and it seems the slaves were given a good education, as they give when one is a slave.
My great-grandmother was trained as a cook, and she in turn trained my grandmother. Now, my grandmother's mother was an Indian maiden who was left on the plantation because she had weak ankles, it seems, and had trouble keeping up with the Trail of Tears in '23 as they passed through south Georgia. The soldiers, who were implementing this march of the Indians to the West, said they would come back and get her, but they never did. That, of course, made my grandmother the grandchild of a squaw. The squaw was not left on the plantation. She went on westward. So this maiden remained on the plantation and became a part of the slave holdings. Eventually she was married to a mulatto, and they raised a family, a boy and a girl. That is why I know that I am a Sambo—all American.﻿6
KA: (cont.) And then, of course, my grandmother married, and she in turn raised a family right there on the plantation. She had five children. My father was about the third; he was the middle child. They happened to have been very alert and were given a good training. The oldest boy was separated from my grandmother, probably when he got around fourteen or fifteen years old. She lost track of him. And then there was a sister, his sister, her oldest daughter, that remained with her until freedom came. My father was eight years old when he was freed.
And of course, the owners of the plantation were very anxious to get the people off of the plantations and into some type of livelihood where they could begin supporting themselves. Fortunately, the Storr School was being set up here in Atlanta by the American Missionary Association. The man who was working with the association was in contact with the man that the association was sending down as principal of this school, so he got with him and they sent another one of the workers down. These three men went all over the state of Georgia to the larger plantations, interviewing the proprietors and the freedmen, telling them about this school that was going to be established in Atlanta, and asking that they send their brightest pupils up to this school. There was an arrangement with the government that families who wanted to come and bring their children, and even children who were large enough to come and be mothered, could be transported by the Union soldiers. These three men happened to have been Edmund Asa Ware, who in two years' time did establish Atlanta University. The other was Erastus M. Cravath that I think about '68 established Fisk University. And the principal-to-be of the Storr School was Cyrus W. Francis, who worked also with the Indians in the Northwest.
These three men asked that the community choose mothers who would come to mother the boys; you know, they didn't think so much about the girls, but the young boys on the plantation, say, fourteen- or fifteen-year-old boys that would come up. They asked that this mother be chosen to come and help find living quarters for these motherless boys. My grandmother, Louisa Redding, happened to have been chosen by both the proprietors and the freedmen on the plantation to come and represent southwest Georgia. So all during my day and up through my living on Auburn Avenue, our house was the transition house. When one came from south Georgia to enter the schools here, they usually came to our house, would get in contact with my grandmother and let her tell them all the places that she knew, or let them stay in our house a week, maybe, until she could find a place for them. We always kept a room for students that were coming in, and most of the young men that graduated from Atlanta University, say from '76, which was our first class, through about 1890, came to our house before they went to the campus to get their bearings. Even after that, a few came. And then it was a habit, not only from the people coming in, to come to the house for information, but our house was just an information center. And the thing that I liked most about the King Center—the building that they will have for their information center—from the drawings, I believe, will be on the spot where my grandmother lived.
MR: So this was what you called Negro Peachtree strip?﻿7
KA: Yes, well, the whole street was called Negro Peachtree, but in this
particular strip between Jackson and Boulevard, the houses there were small replicas of the white people's residences, beginning where the Carnegie Library is downtown now, and running on through the Davison strip out to the Capitol City Club. Now that at first was the city limits of Atlanta, out around the Capitol City Club, out around Harris Street. And the better homes were there. The East Atlanta Land Company, when it got ready to develop Auburn Avenue, put in this strip of houses that were trimmed in what, in architecture, is called gingerbread trimming. Put the gingerbread trimming on this strip between Boulevard and Jackson. And it used the same trimming that was used in this strip up on Peachtree. Most of the houses were just three rooms. The rooms were sixteen feet by sixteen feet. And some of them had a breezeway and a little cookhouse, two rooms. And our house happened to have had the same trimming as on the governor's mansion, and we had the cookhouse.
MR: That's interesting.
KA: So my father was teased quite a bit. He never said his house nor his home, but he always said, "my residence," and said it with great dignity and pride. So his friends used to tease him and our neighbors about the mansion; they called it "the mansion." And I can hear Bishop Holsey's daughter now, calling over the fence to my mother, "Mrs. Ellen, Mrs. Ellen, what's he going to do to the mansion this year?"
Every year... My father knew the value of caring for property. And every year, he had something planned. To probably paint this year outside; maybe next year it was care for the interior walls. And on this particular occasion, Mama said, "Well, he can't find anything to do but put faucets all the way around the house this year!" He knew the value of washing down the house in the summer. See, we were on the thoroughfare and you would have to dust the interior twice a day if you were going to keep your furniture in good condition. See, Auburn Avenue was cherted then. That's crushed rock. And see, we were near Stone Mountain, and Atlanta used that before it started its pavement program. Just like crushed rock for the roadway. Well, anyway, my father would get up in the morning and wash down the house before he went to work. So to make things easy for himself—we already had the faucet in the front yard, and we had one in the back yard— so we had Mr. Henry, the plumber, to come out and put a faucet on either side of the house so it would make things easy. So that was a big joke with them, and they teased my family quite a bit about some of the ways that they had. But those ways really kept that house in good repair, and when the urban renewal took it, kept it about three years before they dismantled it. And it was in such good condition that they just, seemed to hate to...
MR: When was this? How long ago?
KA: They took it in '61, and that must have been around about '64, when they dismantled it there. And it and one other house across the street were left there, as I say, for about these three years. The other house was a house built a little later, probably the first of the nineties, and maybe﻿8
KA: (cont.) in our talk I'll tell you about that house, because it finally became the country club that was operated in 1895 when the Exposition was coming here, the Cotton States Exposition. Auburn Avenue was royal.
MR: Mrs. Adams, I don't know that we've ever established what your father's occupation was; I think we got off there. Would you tell us not only about your father's occupation, but what did the other people do who lived in this rather high-class, middle-class neighborhood.
KA: I'd be glad to do that. As a small boy, I'd say fourteen, fifteen years
old, he secured after school a little job as a bellboy at a boarding house which was upon Peachtree Street, not too far from the school. And then when he got older, and quit school when he was eighteen years old, he secured a job in Judge George Hillyer's office as an office boy. And had the position of what we call receptionist, now. There he stayed quite a number of years, and in the meantime, Judge Hillyer recognized that he was an alert person. And assigned reading to him, and when the reading was completed, he had a law education. Then it was time to get himself established for a family. He secured work with the Merchants Bank. It was one of the few banks in Atlanta; I really don't believe there were more than two or three at that time.
GFB: Primarily then, Mrs. Adams, what we would like to do is take up where
Dr. Rowley left off. I think you said she was asking you about student life, what women did on...
KA: No, we hadn't gotten to that. She just took the family history. I don't remember whether we finished talking on that line. And she was to come back, and we would start on the campus.
GFB: Okay. Well, we could start on the campus, then, today. Could you tell me, when were you attending school at Atlanta University? During what period?
KA: Oh, I entered there in September 1906. One week after the Atlanta riot.
School was supposed to open the Tuesday after the riot, which would be the Tuesday after Labor Day, but the riot came that Saturday night. So school opening was delayed for one week, and I went in the ninth of September, 1906. It was the second week there...
The campus, of course, was quite hushed so far as the teachers and of course the student body...the city students were a little wary because we had to cross town to get to the university. I lived in what was called the old Fourth Ward, and it was peopled principally by former students of Atlanta University. They had purchased property and built their homes near each other. Of course, we had other people in there, but on the principal street were the people who were the leaders of the Negro group...they lived mostly in that old Fourth Ward. And on Auburn Avenue, Howard Street, particularly, over there.

Gay Francine Banks﻿9
KA: (cont.) Of course, it was a five-year course; including the high school, three. Our high school carried three years but covered just about what you all get in one year in college then. And that drew me to finish in 1911. And I can remember the exact date of that was June 1, 1911. But as I said, the Atlanta riot had occurred the week before the opening. And the teachers, of course, were wary, because most of our teachers were Caucasians, and Atlanta University had been denied a state compensation because it was an integrated school. And, of course, the teachers were mostly from the North. And we, I suppose, weathered it and we got along all right. No one bothered us coming through town because we were an orderly group, of course.
GFB: So how did you get across town, did you walk?
KA: We walked. It seems so strange to me now to see the young folk hop in the car and run around the block to see a friend. We walked and from where I lived...and I lived in a block where they have the King Center. Our lot was just about in the center of that block, between Boulevard and Jackson, on the south side of the street. And every day from there, I walked to old Atlanta University. Of course, Morris Brown is housed in those buildings now, but that was a trek that we all made. And it was a very lovely sight, if you could think of it, because the children were mannered, and of course we saw that our clothing was correct, and this trek through town was noticeable by everyone. And we were not molested in any way more or less. We were^encouraged to come along certain walkways, thoroughfares; I see MARTA now is beginning to efface some of the route that we had through town to Mitchell Street. We cut through certain sections and came out where the old terminal station was, onto Mitchell Street, and then over the hill. And by the time the car—they had streetcars then, instead of buses, and some of them really were open cars too, especially in warm weather—by the time the streetcar went around the circle and came back to Jackson Street, we had walked almost to town. Then it would catch us when we got over to Mitchell Street, and then we'd try to outwalk it up to the campus. We had fun. We really had fun. We weren't noisy, really, but still as I say, we had fun. And now if we can come across some of those who walked it or knew about it, we can have a lot of reminiscing.
GFB: So, could you tell me something... I think you said that you studied under Dr. DuBois when he taught at Atlanta University. Could you tell me, what type of person was Dr. DuBois?
KA: Well, he was very astute; a scholarly person, a man of few words, but the words that came out of his mouth were meaningful. He did not waste words. And if there was anything that I tried to learn from him—I don't know whether I can do it as I talk—but in writing, I try to use the words that are most meaningful. I picked that up from him. In his class, if there was a distraction, you lost the thread of what he was saying. You just had to pay attention. And if you paid attention to him, he was the type of professor that saw that you were credited with what you had given back. And to have had a high grade under him is one of my cherished possessions.
GFB: So did he treat the females any different from the males?
Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority﻿10
KA: Oh no, at Atlanta University they didn't treat 'the males, give them any preference over the females. You were just one body. I tell you, the Atlanta University was nondenominational, but President Asa Ware, the founder, was Congregationalist. He happened to have been the first clerk of the First Congregational Church, and one of its cofounders here in Atlanta, so that denomination from the beginning in Atlanta started with the men and the women on equal status. And so he carried that over, of course, into the school. Now, I don't know if you heard that the first little school that was on the campus, on the spot where Morris Brown is performing now, was called the Diamond Hill School.
GFB: No, I don't...
KA: And I didn't realize, my father entered Diamond Hill School as a little
child. He was eight years old at the Emancipation, and his mother brought him up a year after, so he couldn't find his way across town to the Storr School. So she put him on Diamond Hill. I realized why it was called Diamond Hill. Early one morning, I was returning over the Southern Railway System from the north, and as I looked out of the window, I saw Atlanta University, the old Atlanta University with its spire and clock, gleaming in the early morning sun. And it looked just like a diamond, and the contour of the land goes up just like the mounting for a diamond. It was one of the beautiful sights that I'll carry with me all of my life.
He entered there as a child in the first grade. Hadn't been to school at all, of course, and progressed there until he was old enough to find his way across town. The first freedmen that came in here were brought by the Union soldiers in the box cars. Along where we had the Southern Railway building now, and where the old terminal station used to be, were some slave cabins, and that property was owned by a family. We have a street that bears their name, Peters Street, that runs out from where the old terminal used to be. Now, my grandmother lived in one of those cabins when she first came, and it was a straight route for my father to go down Mitchell Street to the Diamond Hill School.
Of course, after '67 when the school was chartered, the name Atlanta University was given the spot, and so many people, though, don't remember that. Now, I don't know, Mrs. Aiken may have referred to it as the Academy...
GFB: No, she didn't...
KA: Often I have heard her say, "You know, my father went to the Academy." Of course, they started there with the grades, starting at first grade. And there were some boys who were old enough, and in some way had obtained enough education to put them on a high school level, and that division of it was called the Academy. So there were a number of the first graduates from the institution, and some of the first students did go right into the Academy.
GFB: So I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit more about some of the other teachers that you had at Atlanta University.﻿11
Oh yes. Well, I'd have to name my favorites, of course. For math, Idella M. Swift. She not only taught math, but she taught you. And you picked it up subconsciously that whatever you did, let it have the exactness that a math problem had. That was one thing you learned from her, exactness. You did not go into her class without first turning in your paper. She taught you responsibility. Your parents were sending you there; you weren't to waste any time in her class; you paid attention.
And of course, the university accepted you through examination, and the better type of students went to Atlanta University...oh yes, you took an examination. Yes, you were examined; oh, when you were in the seventh grade, you went out and took geography and English, and when you got into the eighth grade, you took math and history, and you got in on those four subjects.
Now, let's go back to the teachers. Mr. Edgar Webster was the principal of the high school department, and he was someone with which to deal. He wanted everything done in the quietest, the shortest, most concise way and precise way. He was that kind. He wanted it done just right. The shortest way and the most expressive way.
Then of course, there was Mr. Towns. He belonged to our racial group, George A. Towns. He had finished with a master's in English from Harvard University, and had been an outstanding student when he was in Atlanta University, and he had charge of the English department while I was there. Working with him was a little teacher from the North, Julia A. Ellis, who had finished from Smith College. She was a delightful teacher, and I suppose I have had more enjoyment from her course than any other because I was already reading. Somehow my background goes into a literary group. My great-grandmother was born of a literary family in the antebellum stage, and reading was a part of the household. And it has come right straight on down to me, but Miss Ellis gave you such an insight into the English language that, oh, when you got a book and you started reading, you started applying and seeing what she had taught you in the classroom.
Mr. Towns gave me an insight into poetry, and I thoroughly enjoy that. I enjoyed it then, and I still enjoy it, because I'm trying to do doggerel myself. And so that's one of my hobbies. Now, I have put a good bit of my family... Well, I suppose in a way it's a history. I've made pictures in rhythm of my mother and my father, my reaction when my brother was born, and reaction to the younger members of the family. I always tried to see them when they were babies or very small children, and I have incidents written up of that, and also some humorous things on my grandmother and her churchgoing. And I ran a series in the Atlanta World. I intended to run one for Easter this year, but I got in the hospital and declined it. And I wanted to put...I have the Easter parade on Auburn Avenue; it's a picture of just how the people observed Easter in our old Fourth Ward section, their treks to the churches and so forth and so on.
We musn't leave out Mrs. Forbes, who was—we didn't say "home ec.," we just said "domestic science"—she was the domestic science teacher, and I still have her cookbook. We had to compile the recipes that we used in her lessons, and I still have mine and refer to it sometimes. She was from Miss Farmer's﻿12
(cont.) School of Cooking in New England. And following her was the matron of the domestic science cottage, which was known as Furber Cottage there on the campus. Mrs. Howe followed Mrs. Forbes, and was a very able matron for the building and the training of the girls. You had to take six months of training in that home; eighteen girls lived there with three teachers, and the cottage was ours to run. We had to do everything, marketing as well as preparing the meals and keeping the house. Just running the household as you would your own.
And sewing. I have to say something about that, because they furthered my hobby. I was from a family that didn't depend upon the teacher initiating and discovering your capabilities. Sewing was a part of my family background. My great-grandmother was a head of the weaving house on the plantation. She taught the girls to sew and to weave. She had full charge of the inner group of girls on the plantation. You know, the plantation was set up after the old German commune. And the house servants lived closer to the house, and then there was another group that did work more or less connected with the house, and then further out was the cotton field, and over to the side the men who did the maintenance work, like that. And my great-grandmother had charge of the girls of that inner group. She even had to decide what was best for them, which ones were to be the parlor maids. Which ones would be better with the food service, and so forth, like that. And as I say, the sewing, she had full charge of that, and the separate house in the yard was set up for that, and the schoolmaster's room to the side. And in a number of ways, it served as not only a workshop but a learning area for a good many of them. They could hear what was being taught, and so many of them absorbed it and came out with a fair education.
So the sewing was furthered, of course, when I went to Atlanta University, and I happened to havejnade up to that time the first silk dress that was made in the sewing rooms. Miss Smith, I believe, was the instructor, and after I made what was called a shirtwaist suit, a cotton gabardine shirtwaist and skirt, she said that I didn't need to work any more on cotton. If I would ask my parents if they would buy some silk. And my father was always on that, whatever you're going to have, whatever you're going to buy, let it be the best. You're not going to have a whole lot of cheap things that you can throw away overnight. And so he went down, and shantung was coming in as a new material for women's dresses, and he sent my mother down to look over the shantung and select a piece for me to sew in the sewing rooms. So I say he had great confidence in me, but it turned out all right. And as I say, it was the first silk dress that was made up to this time. Atlanta University didn't allow you to wear silk. No, nobody wore silk on the campus.
I'll tell you a little something that is funny. We teased Mrs. Howe, the matron; we went home on one Saturday of the month, and you could stay over and go to church, be back on the campus by four-thirty Sunday afternoon. So to tease her, we would borrow our mother's taffeta petticoats that they were wearing then under their dresses. You know, it rattled...and we would take great pains going up the steps and let Mrs. Howe hear our taffeta petticoats rustle. And she wouldn't come out and strip you, but she would wait around as if she hadn't heard, and then all of a sudden, she would appear at your door, maybe the next morning, the next day, and say, "I want﻿13
KA: (cont.) that silk petticoat that you brought back here!" She didn't catch mine, though, because I had wrapped it up and carried it over the bridge to my sister to take home. We'd tease her like that. We had a lot of fun with teachers, and they joined in with our jokes, and sometimes they played jokes on us. We were just a big family on the campus; the boarding department was just a big family. They tried to make it as homelike as possible for us. All of the teachers were nice.
And if you wanted to be taught quietness, how to move about without disturbing anyone, you had to think of Miss Johnson, who kept the study hall. She was the emblem of quietness and of dignity. I can see her now, she sat nearly, not stiff, but she was erect, and she could move all over the study hall and not make a sound. It was just good to look up and see her weaving in and out and checking the students, and to know that unless you just wanted to look up, rest your eyes, you wouldn't know that she was about. They instilled into us on that campus certain traits. You picked them up; we picked them up subconsciously. No one told you to do this or that. But they put it right in front of your eyes, and put it in such a way that you had to pay attention to it. Arid wish that you could do or could be as they were. And as they did.
GFB: So what about...
KA:	It was a lovely life on campus.
GFB: I didn't mean to cut you off, but...
KA:	That's all right.
GFB:	...I was wondering about, was it President Ware at the time?
KA: No, President Ware died in '84 or '85, so I didn't catch him. My mother
didn't even catch him. And my mother went out in '86, but she didn't stay there but about two months, because she had been an outstanding student in the old Storr School, and had taken even the first kindergarten course that was taught. So she had been recommended for teaching out in the county, and she got on out in Rockdale County, so she didn't continue in Atlanta University. In the Storr School, when they finished there, they had about what you would call a junior high now, so she made a reputable teacher down in the county for those days. She taught about three years, two and a half to three years, before she married.
GFB: So I was asking you about the president.
KA: Oh yes, he passed as I said, in '84 or '85. I'm not positive on that date now, I'd have to look that up. But when I went there, Mr. Horace Bumstead was the president. Now, he wasn't on the campus very much when I was there. He stayed in the North, more or less soliciting funds for the institution. But he was a very genteel and honorable character. And then after he left, the first President Ware's son, Edward Twichell Ware, became president, and he was on the campus on and off. The president didn't stay on the campus as they do. I don't suppose they stay in the office continuously now, even. They travel about. President Ware came to the campus though, oh, just around﻿14
KA: (cont.) Easter, or after Easter, and said he was going to stay and learn
the senior class. He didn't think it was fair to the students not to know their president, and he wanted to know the students, of course. So in order to know the senior class, he formed a Sunday school class and had us in his Sunday school class. He was a delightful teacher.
GFB: So who took care of the affairs once President Bumstead was away?
KA: Dr. Myron Winslow Adams took charge. Now he came after Bumstead. He was a teacher there, head of the languages. He taught Greek, and I'm not sure if he was vice-president, I'd have to look that up. But anyway, he took charge of affairs while...
GFB: So what were some of the activities that the young females did, you know, on campus?
KA: Well, on the campus...what do you mean, the work activities or the social activities, or did you have both in mind?
GFB: Yes, I was thinking about both.
KA: Well, let's take the work. They had a system there, if you wanted to be a work student, of course you could have your fees lowered, and for that work you waited, you served the meals to the table—or placed the meals on the table, I should say—and helped with the dishroom work. You could also have a sweeping area, probably two halls that you would sweep in the morning; just household duties there. You could—let me see, what else you could do—oh, you could assist in the laundry. Ordinarily you could do your own clothing, but if you wanted this work job, you could assist the laundress with the general laundry for the buildings, and you could iron—the boys' clothes were done by the laundresses. Some of the boys could act as
assistant to the librarian, assistant to the shop with Mr____I've forgotten
his name now, the teacher's name, but anyway, the teacher instructor down at the shop, and I think they had household duties too, such as sweeping. Oh yes, and could help, I suppose you'd call him the farm manager. They had a herd of cows there and a kitchen garden back now where Morris'Brown had the baseball field.
GFB: Right.
KA: The kitchen garden back there, and a little stream ran through there.
Oratory came under Mr. Towns's, the English instructor's, supervision, and we had to find things that we had had on the program for papers, discussion and debates and so forth. The young women had a YMCA connection, and we named our literary society The Phillis Wheatley, and that Miss Ellis, the assistant to Mr. Towns, had charge of the Phillis Wheatley Society. And she had you up there in the white dress and the ribbon bow tied at your back at least once during the year, appearing on oratoricals. And then the﻿15
KA: (cont.) young women had a debating society.
GFB: Did they debate among themselves, or...
KA: Yes, yes. The girls debated among themselves and the boys among themselves We had a lot of enjoyment from the debating society. And as I say, I was just one of these kind, I was just going to get my neck broken with everything. So I worked negative rebuttal with other girls. Janie Barnett was on the negative and A. Ernestine Bell, and Nellie E. Hawes, who is Mrs. Middleton now, worked on the affirmative side. We made the boys sit up and look at us when the first debate of our young women, the year that I was on the pane],,was announced; boys—and I don't remember the subject now—but the boys thought it was a subject that probably we wouldn't handle very well. And they thought they were coming there to have some fun and laugh, because in the senior class, the senior class vied, the girls vied with the boys, and they just knew that they were going to have some fun. But I can see Fred Toomer now saying, "Well, you girls certainly fooled us. We thought we were going to laugh so. But you really handled it very well." We had, as I say, enjoyment. It wasn't foolish giggling fun that we had, but we got pleasure out of the things that were required of us and that should have been. I formed many good friendships that lasted throughout our lives over at that debating team. I think Mrs. Middleton is still living and Mrs. Janie Barnett Charlton, so that three of us from that debating team are still living.
GFB: So, did they ever have any other, did you have any other social activities, like dances or...
KA: No, they didn't allow dancing, but at the end of the oratoricals there was always a social. And as I say again, I have to tell it as it is, I'm pigeon-toed. And Mr. Webster, the principal of the school, was pigeon-toed I don't know whether in his younger days the young ladies didn't want to march with him or not, or dance with him because of his pigeon toes, but let the music start and Mr. Webster was making a bow in front of me and we led the marches for the oratoricals. The year that I was on the campus, that was a job. And my roommate would say, "He doesn't ever let you get a chance to have any of the boys select you, he's up there." I'd say, "He's pigeon-toed and I'm pigeon-toed," and I'd say, "I think he thinks we look all right together." We had fun. No, we didn't dance, they didn't allow dancing, but you did march. And we learned to do, we'd be in the gym more or less for that; having a large space, you see, you could do the intricate turnings and make it almost like a dance. I had learned the marching techniques when I was in kindergarten, so it came easy, with me.
GFB: I noticed that there were certain groups on campus, you know. Would you know about the Owls and the Wolves?
KA: Yes, the school did not approve of that, but the boys had something that they called the Owls and the Wolves. You see, the school did not approve of fraternities, so they just had these, what they called societies, on the campus and... Well, the girls didn't pay too much attention to it because﻿16
KA: (cont.) we couldn't see the foundation for it, but the boys all did. The only thing that we, the girls, had to go on, was—because it was supposed to be, you know, a secret society—and the only thing we had to go on was, we noticed the top students were the Wolves on the campus. Some of the better students were the Owls, but more of the Wolves were evident, with their names. Now, we didn't have what was called the Dean's List; we didn't say, "You're on the Dean's List," but you'd say, "Your name is on the bulletin board,'and we could always find more of those boys on the bulletin board who were Wolves, like that.
GFB: But do you think the fact that someone was lighter than another person, did they have an advantage, do you think?
KA: Oh well, most of the lighter boys went to the Owls, and we said they were asleep, and that's... they weren't the, you know, top students, usually. And they had to have something to set them aside so, as you say, most of them were lighter skinned. I wouldn't want that published though. I don't think that was any credit to us.
GFB: I was wondering if we could sort of talk a little bit about the church now. I want to know, has the church played an important role in your life?
KA: You mean, my personal church or the church on the campus?
GFB: Your personal church.
KA: Well, my goodness. I am the historian of the First Congregational Church, and we don't want to get into that. But Atlanta University is so wrapped up with the First Congregational Church that you would say they were one and the same. As I told you before, President Edmund Asa Ware was the first clerk of the church. We have ten charter members of that church, and his name is the third name on the list. The First Congregational Church of Atlanta has always been an integrated church. The first three names are Caucasian because they were the ones selected for pastor, and his wife, of course, and then Edmund Asa Ware. And you see, I don't separate the two. You say Atlanta University, you mean First Congregational Church. You say First Congregational Church, that means Atlanta University.
And of course in that it was so connected with the Storr School...you see, I have a friend that called this to my attention, that most of the time you hear of a school being formed from the church body. But in that case, the church grew out of the school. So it's just Atlanta University. Atlanta University was so far away from the Storr School, and transportation being what it was in the late sixties, the teachers had no way, you see, of crossing town to the school, to a church. Or they felt a little queer in going into the Caucasian church, because they were called carpetbaggers; they weren't readily received. So, they formed the idea of forming a church where they could go, and where also the children of the school who had no church connection and whose parents had no church connection could have somewhere to come. Because the chapel of the Storr School had become the social center for the freedmen's activities here in Atlanta. So this﻿17
KA: (cont.) church was formed In the school and out' of the participants in the educational system that was being set up.
We didn't know anything except Atlanta University. Why, I don't know when I first knew I was going to Atlanta University, but there wasn't anywhere else to think about going. My father had been there, my mother had been— and stayed two months! All...I won't say all, but the vast majority of their friends went to Atlanta University. A good many of my mother's intimate friends and most of her associates went on from the Storr School to Atlanta University. All the people who were living around me, the majority of the people living around me were Atlanta University graduates or Atlanta University students...
GFB: Are you getting tired?
KA: Well, I don't think it's so much tired; I have a little hoarseness that
overtakes me sometimes. So Atlanta University was the goal and let's see, I had only three teachers in grade school who were not Atlanta University graduates. And one—no, two—from Clark, which was manned by Atlanta University graduates in the beginning. Another was from Fisk, and of course, Dr. Erastus M. Cravath helped set up the educational—aided, I would say—the educational setup here in the very beginning before he went on and founded Fisk. In fact he preached the initial sermon for the First Congregational Church. Have you been over to our church?
GFB: It's located at Houston and Courtland?
KA: That's right.
GFB: I haven't attended service there, but I know where the church is. I can't say I...
KA: Well, I wish you would come over and sometime worship with us, and then I wish you could come and especially investigate our windows. I would tell you to go into the office for information, but it would be what I put in there mostly. And I made not tapes, but I did write out something on our history for the archives of the American Missionary Association in '61. So I would like for you to come over and worship with us. And the windows on the church are very meaningful. You would say the church and my life... I think those windows probably governed my life anyway—the meaning of them. For the first window they have the parting of David and Jonathan. And then we have, of course, Abraham Lincoln in one of the windows, who had a very special spot where I am concerned; as I say, my father was eight years old when the Emancipation was signed. And then we have another window there, Christ in the garden of Gethsemane. We have a triptych to motherhood, then another to young womanhood, purity, and on the other side of the church we have Christ in the Temple, which we dedicated to the young men of the church. Then we have the educational triptych dedicated to one of the principals of the Storr School, a Miss Miller, who stayed there very long and was very important in the life of the students of that school. And in the center of that triptych is the Reverend George Standing, who was the first to give﻿18
KA: (cont.) out Bibles to Negro children. He worked for the American Bible Society.
And then the third window has a special meaning for me; it's the first missionary that Atlanta had of any sort. She was called the official missionary of the church, and her work covered all of Atlanta and all races in Atlanta. She returned to the church when the Storr School was closing in 1901. It was just the time I was finishing the third grade. She came out to our house; that little table right there saw her, and that's my family's parlor table. She of course had to see all of the family, and my father told me to go and get my, as we called it, "promoted card," and of course I was very happy over that, and finished the third grade the week before. She looked at it and praised me for it, for having brought home such a wonderful card, and she said, she stood up and put her hand on top of my head and prayed that I'd be as smart a little girl as my father was, because he was the smartest little boy that she ever taught. And that gave me something to work toward. And I very seldom go in that church that I don't turn my head as I sit down and look at that window of Miss Stevenson. And my goal is to do the best that I can, and has, you know, has always been through the years. She put that into it—always try to be as good as everybody else, not to let anyone particularly top me. That has been my goal from... I've had a wonderful connection from the church and the school. As I say, the church and the school to me is one, but my church means so much to me.
Going back to the windows, on the balcony we have this window to Dr. Cravath, the founder of this; there, it was given by the students of this university. We have also one to a Mr. and Mrs. Joseph E. Roy. Mrs. Roy gave it in honor of her husband, one of the secretaries of the American Missionary Association, that had a lot of influence in the founding of the Storr School here. And the dome of the church was dedicated to the American Missionary Association. And it's quite provocative, thinking of the herald angels bringing the good news of the birth of the Savior. Well, you don't want to leave the church before you look up at the dome. Dr. Henry Hugh Proctor used to say—that's one of the former ministers, the church was built during his regime—to bring your children to the church, bring the babies. They may not know what it's all about, but the windows of the church will be their first picture book. And as they grow, their knowledge will grow with the windows of the church. Behind the pulpit is a picture, in stained glass, of course, of the rich young ruler, and he was advised to sell his goods and give the money to the poor. It's very beautiful and you see, you face it all the time. It's over the baptistry. When I don't get to the church, I feel as if I've just missed something. It's just something to go in there and sit down in the presence of history. And the secular and the biblical history, it's always before you, always reminding you...beautiful.
GFB: So what kind of a person was Dr. Proctor?
KA: Oh, dynamic. That's the word for him. He was a man who was far ahead of
his time. Far ahead. There was something about him that was sacred. When you were in his presence...I had a young woman that finished up here at Atlanta University, since it's been a university; she lived with me for a﻿19
KA: (cont.) while. And she said when she was a little girl, Dr. Proctor had left Atlanta and had gone to Brooklyn to establish a church there; the AMA wanted him to see if he couldn't bring out the church in New York. And her mother, formerly from down here, took her, of course, along with her to church. And she said at four years old, Dr. Proctor came to their house one day, and she ran and opened the front door. She said she looked up at him, and she turned and flew back to her mother and said, "Mama, Reverend Proctor and God is here." And he gave you that feeling. That's the way you felt; you were in the presence of someone that was sacred. He was a very intelligent person; he was a graduate of Yale Theological Seminary. Fisk University, of course, first, and then Yale. And he was very intelligent; I don't think we've had anyone at the church who was any more intelligent than he was. And we haven't had one that inspired us to reach out and do as much as we did when he was there. Maybe it seems that way to most of us, because he came in 1895, just at the time when we needed someone to propel us forward. Of course now, I think the ministers feel that we have gotten to a certain point, and maybe they don't try to reach out and to seek new lines of endeavor, as he did. But he was into the civic matters of the city and particularly of our group.
Now, we don't tell anyone, "You must go and vote, and vote for so and so and so." We know that it is considered a part of our duty to attend to the development of the city and the country, but we don't go into politics as such. But we have from that church sent to the city hall the first Negro that had a position there—Yates. Well, in fact, we've had just about everywhere... If you want to name a position, they've had to pull the first one from our church. I think probably on this present city council we don't have anyone, butMaynard Jackson's mother was one of my Sunday school students. Maynard Jackson's grandfather and grandmother were officials in the First Congregational Church. So I just feel that although Irene, his mother, married a Baptist minister, and of course had to follow him in his church and that's where they raised their children, in the Friendship Baptist Church here, I say he belongs to us, because of the background there. His grandfather, Mr. Dobbs, was a trustee, and Mrs. Dobbs was a deaconess there in the church. And all of the children were christened there.
GFB: So what kind of a person was Mr. Dobbs?
KA: Oh, he was a civic leader; he was grand master of the Masons, when it came
to that type of endeavor, and he was a leader among I suppose what you would say the common people. Now, for his livelihood, he was really a postal clerk, but Mr. Dobbs was very outspoken. And Maynard Jackson, our present mayor, has a very good delivery, and I say that he doesn't come up to his grandfather, but he has the idea, and I think that he will finally, you know, achieve. But when Mr. Dobbs spoke, whether you wanted to or not, you listened. He was just that type of speaker. He would get you into his clutches, so to speak, and he had you there. You just stayed there practically spellbound until he got through, and when he got through your shoulders gave a slump. Why? Because he had interested you so. He was a man who got along with the common man.
GFB: So was he responsible for Auburn Avenue being known as Sweet Auburn? I mean﻿20
GFB: (cont.) being called that?
KA: Well, yes, I think he named it Sweet... I don't like that. You know, I
was born on Auburn, and Auburn Avenue was a dignified street, and we spoke of it as "The Avenue." And I resent "Sweet Auburn." Now, I never did get the import of that Sweet Auburn. Now, in later years, when he was grand master, the Masonic Temple was put up on Auburn. But when I was a child, going to grade school, Auburn was principally a residential street, and with better houses, better people. You had your grocer's, your drugstore; all were manned by pioneers in the business. See, Auburn Avenue at first was planned as a German village. I suppose it would be one of the first housing complexes set up in the city. And it was peopled by German-Americans at first, and they gradually moved out. Oh, it took them twenty or twenty-five years, though, to clear the settlement. My father bought there in 1884, from a Mrs. Reisman, who was a German Jew. And gradually the other part of Auburn was filled in, with our people. But in 1884, that was as far as we went down Auburn. Now some of those German Jews stayed there. I was, I know I was twenty-five or more years old, and my grandmother nursed Mrs. Seisinger that lived two blocks above us. And up on our corner there was a widow and her children. Dr. Maser was in there; but as I say, he put that temple down there, and then all of a sudden I heard them calling it Sweet Auburn. But by that time, so many of the businesses had opened up down there, small shops, restaurants and down around Butler Street, between Butler and Polk, came what we considered as a little letdown there. It was a hangout for some people that we didn't care about having in the neighborhood. So now what he meant by Sweet Auburn, I don't know, and I never did have it explained, just what he meant by Sweet Auburn. Because, as I say, we looked upon Auburn as a dignified street. Do you know where Wheat Street Baptist Church is?
GFB: Yes. Yes, I do.
KA: Well, from about a block below there, down on the corner below there, Lena Home's people, the Calhouns, her grandparents, lived. And on that spot was a very fine gingerbread type of trimmed house, and beginning there, coming on up to Boulevard, that was called Negro Peachtree. See, because the houses were replicas of the houses along Peachtree where Davidson is now, right in that. And the governor's mansion was there. And it so happened that those houses had that...you know what I mean when I say gingerbread trim.
GFB: Right, right, yes.
KA: Go back to pictures of Hansel and Gretel and you get the idea. Every other house was trimmed alike, and it so happened that on the corners there were those two-story houses with the double trimming upstairs and downstairs. Well, our house was right in the middle of the block, and they put the same trimming on it as was on the governor's mansion, so many of my father's friends used to call it "the mansion." Like that! And the people along there cared for their homes just as well as the people on Peachtree, and most of them were white collar workers. So as I said, we referred to it as "The Avenue," and I resent "Sweet Auburn" because that sounds a little letdown to me.﻿21
GFB: Okay, I was wondering if we could go back to your Congregational church again. I know a famous person, he also was a graduate of Atlanta University, Walter White, was a member there. I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about him.
KA: Walter? I went to school with him, a personal friend, all that kind of stuff. Yes, Walter lived diagonally across from the church there on Houston Street where Cathcart parks its big moving vans now. He grew up right there, and right in the church, and he went to the Houston Street School where most of us went, a public school one block down the street, and from there to Atlanta University. He also went through the Sunday school at First Congregational Church there as the rest of us did. He was just one of us. And he came out, I think he came out in 1916 from Atlanta University, got a job as an insurance agent for the present Atlanta Life Insurance. Was it Atlanta Life? Well, for an insurance company. Well, I suppose it was what is now the Atlanta Life; it went under another name then. And he was just out of school, as I said. And then he got to New York and got in with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and became its secretary, of course, and I think he held that until he passed. He did, as you know, a very outstanding piece of work where the National Association was concerned; he even became a White House lobbyist, a Congressional lobbyist.
His sister, Mrs. Eugene Lamont, is still at the church; of course, she has children and grandchildren. And I understand one of Walter's children died not too long ago. But I suppose you know he's nationally known, that he is very impatient, but just like any other home town boy, he's just considered among us all as Walter. And he was always a very fine, charming... In fact, all of Mr. and Mrs. White's children were very fine children. Mr. White, Walter's father, was our senior deacon there in the church for any number of years. He was a man that was loved by all, a genuine Christian type of man, quiet, and he was a...
GFB: Well, could I ask you one more question before we conclude our interview
for today? Going back to when you were a student at Atlanta University, I notice that you said you studied under Dr. DuBois. Did you ever pick up his reactions to Booker T. Washington?
KA: Not particularly. I tell you, he tried to get over to us what we are going into now, and that is the history and understanding of the African, the different African countries and tribal life. Now, I think it was in May, it was just before the commencement season began; he had the chapel lined with posters referring to the African countries and information that we are seeking now to get from Africa. Now, he tried to...that was the type of sociology that he started there at the university. And as I said, that would be 1910, was a class in sociology—they had the introduction of sociology—and it was in 1910. And this James Brawley, who left Morehouse, he was a professor at Morehouse then, he left Morehouse and went to Howard University. This is James Brawley; he started a class at Morehouse, and then Dr. DuBois and Brawley would exhange lectures. One time Brawley would come over and lecture to us, and that's the way it was started. But﻿22
KA: (cont.) no one got any credit for it, because they deemed it was time to start it in the curriculum. But no chair had been provided for it in either one of the institutions. So that was a start, and four or five years after I came out, Atlanta University did set up a chair for it. I'm quite sure it was that length of time after, because we all were teaching; me and my classmates were teaching, and several others, and we all contributed to that chair there. It was set up, Dr. DuBois was the first that...
GFB: Okay, at this particular point, then, I guess we could just end it anywhere..
KA: This is so rambling; when we first started...
GFB: Okay then, Mrs. Adams, I was wondering if today you could go back and tell me something about your attitude toward the women's movement today.
KA: My attitude toward the women's movement goes back to Genesis. The woman and the man are supposed to be helpmates; they're supposed to dovetail for the best performance. You will recall that in the first family, the man was the hunter and he went out and brought in provisions. The woman stayed in the home, the cave or the hut, or the teepee, whatever it happened to be, and cured or preserved what was brought in for food. Then we went a little further there with this correlation. The woman was a little more outside; maybe she started just finding the berries and certain roots that she used later on for medicinal purposes, while the man was still out with his hunting, we should say, although it was in probably a different form, after we learned of the fire and the wheel and so forth. As as the years went along, and we get to the Negro family particularly, and that role was really not in true evidence until after the Emancipation, because the regime under which Negroes lived required that there not be a family. The man probably lived on the one plantation, the woman on the other. And they saw it best that way, not to have the slaves on the one plantation marry one on the same plantation. And also it was to make a better work condition for the men; all of them could not do work on the plantation in the cotton field. They had to have some tradesmen, and probably one person who didn't even own a plantation would hire some of those groups of Negro men, and they did the building probably, things of that sort. Here in Georgia the Atlanta Constitution had an article several years ago about the most prestigious bridge builder in Georgia, and he was a Negro man.
GFB: What was his name?
KA: His name was William W. King. He married Georgia Swift, a graduate of
Atlanta University, and he lived in southwest Georgia. And he learned the trade, went after the Emancipation, why, of course, on his own. He became outstanding as a bridge builder. There were men who did the logging, seasoned the wood for the building of these colonial homes that are now standing; that work was all done by the men, while the women were in the﻿23
KA: (cont.) weaving rooms.
Most of the work for the carrying on of the plantation was done by the Negro women in majority. My great-grandmother had charge of the weaving, what she called the weaving room on the plantation. They wove the material and made the clothing for all of the people on the plantation, even to the suits for the men. My sister has a very interesting photo album of some of the people dressed in their Sunday best, and the men with the little piped pants that, oh, two or three years ago, the boys around were trying to wear, that style, type of fitting pants. It's very interesting to me to see that. I know where that style originated and when it originated— back in the early days of our country.
Now the women, in the days before the Emancipation, knew that some day there would be a better day for them and for their children. They looked forward to that. And history gives us some of the women who worked with the Underground Railroad and the antislavery societies in this country. I know you will recall that Sojourner Truth was a great help in the underground movement that they had, and Harriet Tubman went further than that. She became a lecturer in the antislavery movement. There were any number of women who worked with that, carried on their particular activities and also had their minds toward this forward movement.
Then we go along a little further, say, in the forties, fifties and into the sixties and seventies and we find that the women were, the Negro women were the first to enter the social movement, the social betterment that we have. The Negro woman also being the first to go into integration. They worked along with the other race, seeing and evaluating what was being accomplished, say, by the movement for betterment of young women. The young men were getting a good start in those early days, but there wasn't very much for the young woman. And you can remember that Jane Addams established Hull House, and that is something that the Negro woman looked into. And when we did establish the NAACP, we can recall that Mary White Ovington was an efficient worker in social service.
Further on, the woman, and I'm speaking particularly of the Negro woman, who saw an opportunity in business...and we have Madam Walker who established the hair-growing product, and along with her we have Mrs, Malone who established the Poro hair products. That put the Negro woman on the scene, and we found that she could be an efficient businesswoman and right on into things. Plus the Negro woman has gone in business; in my particular area, around the Auburn Avenue business section, there were any number of girls who first went into secretarial work here in Atlanta, working at the Odd Fellows, and the insurances that were being established up and down the Auburn Avenue business section. And the same things happened in Chicago. Young women were being taken in as secretaries. And of course from the very beginning of the young woman going out to schools, to college, she had the teaching course as the most lucrative and most profitable career for the young woman.
I should have mentioned also in literature, we had women entering that field﻿24
KA: (cont.) with the entrance of Phillis Wheatley. . Here in Atlanta we had
Georgia Douglas Johnson, who backed up that, and became a writer of note. She was a graduate of old Atlanta University, and had taught in the city schools of Atlanta. She married Henry Lincoln Johnson. Her husband was an eminent lawyer, and they finally went to Washington City to live, and most of her writing is done from there, in the area where she was living.
Now going back to my attitude toward the present movement, I feel that we should be sure of what this movement will bring us. Now, will it bring us to an elevation of our calling, which is teaching in the school and in the home—in the home first, and then in the schoolroom? The women are teachers. You take a little boy and a little girl not yet ready for kindergarten, put them down on the floor with blocks, building blocks, of course, and right away they start a castle. The girl is more adept at handling those blocks, and she's going to get her castle built before that boy. She's going to try to show him, leave her to show him how it gets done. And he doesn't want to get shown. And I feel that that's the way this movement... if we go too rapidly, we're going to run up against something. As long as the woman lives, she's going to attempt to teach, and there's got to be something worked out that will coordinate that.
Now if the woman is capable of doing the type of work and working in the same company that the man is, and doing the same thing, so far as the pay is concerned, I think she should have the equal pay. But I do believe, as the law of the universe is set, that the woman and the man are going to have to find a way to use their natural instincts. Because if a woman gets into a thing, in her home, she's going to teach; that is innate. She cannot help it. And I think we all know that males do not want to be taught by females. That, as I say, they're going to, but I think from the time you come out of school, or possibly a little before, you need to get out into the world to see, feel around, what you think is best for you, and stick with it for at least four years. It takes that long for a woman to really find out whether she can be self-sufficient, whether she has acquired enough knowledge to be able to support herself. But when she takes on the vows of wedlock, and does have a family growing, I think she should be at home to do the teaching. What the child learns in the home for the first five or six years, determines what he is going to be. You can add to it, you can dress it up in a few frills. But basically, it's the same as he was when he was five or six years old. His attitudes have been formed by that time, and I feel that is the woman's job. So much for the woman's movement.
GFB: Okay then, Mrs. Adams, I wonder if we could move on into another area then. I was wondering if you could tell us what you consider to be your most important achievement as you look back over your life?
KA: Well, since I've just come out of the hospital, and I am approaching my eighty-seventh birthday, to know that they could not find anything radically wrong with my body, that I carry within what I consider, and the doctors consider, a marvelous condition. And I think that probably one of my greatest achievements is to bring to this age a body that has responded to the care that has been given it. First my parents, because I feel that﻿25
(cont.) I was well born. My parents directed the care of my body until I was able to take over, and I have tried to maintain a healthy, active body, physically and mentally. And I think properly to have cared for that which God has given me, through the direction of my parents, and my own interest in it, is the highest achievement that I could have made.
Then when it comes down to the very thing that I have said, that it was given to woman, the ability to teach to children, to understand what makes a family for the development of humanity. If they can feel the teaching, I've got my reward. I start to sing praises when I say that, because so many of the children that I have taught are still giving very actively to the latter part of my life. To see them go forward and to have them tell me that I was part of it all: "You started me, you set my feet and my mind toward certain things"; that has been something that I have cherished through the years and still cherish.
When I hear the voice of a woman who sits in the Georgia legislature over the air, to have Grace Towns Hamilton in the legislature with her comparative thinking on the laws in the state of Georgia, I feel is an achievement. I feel that I did help her start...
There was another young man, I came across him in high school. I went to a class one day. I was a supply teacher, and as most classes think, when the regular teacher is out, they're going to have frolic today. I was able to pin them down and start questions on the lesson, and I found that they were not particularly interested. Then, of course, I started my little lecture on the importance of this particular assigned class—the importance of government law. This boy became interested. And when he was running for the House of Representatives, he came by my door and knocked, and told me that I was the cause of his becoming interested in government. That little visit to the door was more than a reward to me. Now he has gone on as part of the Carter, the president of the United States' advisory committee. These are simple incidents, but they mean so much to me as an achievement, to see the sons and the daughters of students that I have taught. And that the student has carried something, not just from the book, but something, a little everlasting growth.
And another incident, a young man that I had charge of when I was supplying in the Carrie Steele Orphan Home. There were things to be taught those children, many of them very underprivileged. This young man, you might say, was of middle class. He finally grew up and married, and went to the West Coast to study, and reared his family. He came back one year and brought his children to see me., stating that his children were anxious to see someone that they had to obey, and was not anywhere around them. They'd never seen her, but they knew her, because what she said was the better thing to do. And when as a matter of fact that, I think, things...I feel that those are the incidents, things that have passed between teacher and pupil, with the finest enjoyment and the highest achievement.
Then a week ago, on the bus, opposite me, I saw a woman who had to be in her forties, and her eyes were just sparkling and beaming at me. And she said, "Did you ever teach at the Roach Street School?" And I said, "Yes, I﻿26
KA: (cont.) did." She said, "I know you." And I said, "Come over and sit beside me." She did. And she said, "I'm Thelma Glanton. You were my first grade teacher. I've never forgotten the day; that we spent together." And I had not seen that woman for probably thirty or so years. And she still remembered. It must have been something that she had seen. And knowing that, I feel so good, and it comes as an achievement and a reward.
Now, you asked about awards. I worked at the Postal Alliance of Employees for a number of years and I did get an award for that service. But that has not been my goal, never was. And it will never be. But if I can be remembered for one little thing that I put into a child, I am thankful. Right here in Atlanta, I must say this too. This young man...he's not young any more, because he has retired from the Atlanta Board of Education as one of the finest teachers that they have ever had. When there was something new that the board wanted to initiate here in Atlanta, Ralph Long was chosen to write his name. He has been constantly around me. I taught most of his children in that family. I married before I had the chance to teach the baby boy, and he'll jump up and run and follow me and walk about with me and talk... Just little things of that sort, I think, are the finest thing that a woman can do. Teach. And teach the younger generation. Not look for any acclaim, not look for any award. But she will be rewarded by seeing the generation that she has tried to help go forward and move into new fields.
Okay then, I wonder if you could tell us then, now that you've retired from public life, I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about your hobb ies. What do you do for relaxation?
GFB:
KA: I am descended from an artistic family. In the field of music, however, I feel that I am most satisfied in the field of art; I listen. And in former years when it was more convenient for me to go, I would always have a season ticket to the arts that were brought into Atlanta. Just before you knocked on the door, I was being thrilled by Artur Rubinstein on the keyboard. No other artist, not even Paderewski, whom I heard, can do or could do different styles. A versatile pianist. I think I've heard the outstanding artists of the world that were brought here, including Marian Anderson's mellowing contralto, Lily Pons's feathery lightness, Arturo Toscanini and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Fritz Kreisler, the master of the violin. I heard Roland Hayes's first appearance as an artist in Atlanta's new Municipal Auditorium in 1909. In fact, of those artists, some passed on, but I find the stations on the radio that do their recordings, and I still enjoy them. The only thing that I miss now is the ballet. I don't get a chance to attend now. It isn't convenient to do so. And you don't find too much of that on the television.
Apart from music, I think probably I get the most out of sewing, because it is creative to take up material, spread it out, and then after some hours of working, to come up with a dress that brings beauty to someone's body; I just feel it. And I like to sew for young people whose bodies are alive, and are going somewhere. And when I make a dress for an older person, I want the young people's trait for going, because I think if there﻿27
(cont.) is anything that is thrilling and enlivening to any group, it is a beautifully dressed young woman. And when I say beautifully, I don't mean
to say that there is a decline in beauty of costume, but I do think our younger people are going to have to retrace the road, and find something to wear that is going to show God has given them a body to be adorned, not treated as if it was of no significance to anything, and just be thrown on; the beauty of costume is a hobby with me.
For twenty years of course, I haven't done very much in watercolors, but now I am working with the watercolors. One of my hobbies through the years has been the making of cards. I.don't buy the commercial cards to send to most of my particular friends, especially those who went to the grade school with me and on into the high school of Atlanta University, where we attended some of the same art classes. They just look for a card that I have made, and I do send them. In fact, I had a friend who had become an invalid and is now living in Detroit. But I had been in the hospital and I hadn't sent her a card in a long time. She said in a letter,"I've been looking for a card, a 'get well' card, from you. One that you've made yourself." So over the Easter season, I was a little hard hit for the time to reply, to make my "get well" card, to send "thank you" cards, and Easter cards too. But I thrill over it and I get to working with something of that sort, I can stay up half of the night, get up the next morning, and I'm not tired.
Then I have another hobby, and I have saved them [poems], and I've looked forward to what I would do with them through the years. And I'm not just bragging... I belong to a church club. In this club, most of the people are literary-minded, and I think most of us tried to express ourselves at least twice a year in that club. I always look forward to the time I would see them. About 1940, thereabout, maybe just a little before, I could see the idea of putting into the rhythm of line the history of the life with my family at 339 Auburn Avenue. And I pictured I was home, and what it meant to me, what the light in the old front door meant to me as a child coming up in that household. And from then on I started writing about different little incidents that happened in the home. Some serious to me, as when my brother was born. I was the oldest child and he was the fourth, and I just knew there were so many children in the home, I was soon to be put out of that home. And to me as a ten-year-old child, that was rather traumatic. And I captured that in rhythm. Visits with my grandmother to the church and the sight of my father walking down Auburn Avenue in his Prince Albert coat, a black Stetson hat, walking cane, striped trousers on a first Sunday morning. And I put into verse the tinkling voice of my mother, her bright eyes, big smile, right straight on through to my niece in her crib and how she could make those bootees fly off of her feet. Just little incidents like that.
And I did have, I wrote each for a Negro history group, the aspiration of one Negro mother from the days of slavery to her death, and the woman that I used for a model was my paternal grandmother, the one that I said in an earlier tape came here to work with Edmund Asa Ware, Dr. Cravath, and Reverend Francis In setting up the first school for Negroes here in Atlanta. That school, you recall, was sponsored by the AMA and it was situated on﻿28
(cont.) Houston Street, between Courtland and Piedmont. It occupied a building that had been the quartermaster's headquarters during the Civil War. It was known as the Storr School, named for one of the secretaries of the American Missionary Association. I think my family was typical of most Negro families as they came out of the days of slavery.
I get quite a thrill out of trying to rhyme work; I write in free verse mostly. I can rhyme but I like the free verse. I have written some things that have been used publicly for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the First Congregational Church which grew out of that Storr School. I wrote my impressions of the first little church, and what it was worth to the congregation. That was used that year, and I also had published in one of the brochures, the "100" brochure, the groundbreaking for the present church at the corner of Courtland and Houston Street. Booker T. Washington was the guest speaker for the occasion and it was memorable, and I thought it should be put into verse. One or two other things, since I am a historian for that church. Now I am probably, as far as I can see, the only child of the church; that is, I was christened in that church December 14, 1890. That is, received in the church. I do know that I am the oldest active member that came from the christening time to the present day. Those little hobbies keep me going, and when I'm not working with one, I'm working with the other.
GFB: Today is April 30, 1977. This is an interview with Mrs. Kathleen Adams at 970 Palmetto Avenue, Southwest, Atlanta, Georgia. Mrs. Adams, as a professional black woman, what are your attitudes toward illegitimacy?
KA: I am of the old school, and for a family I feel there should be marriage. I go with those who believe that the child is of special importance and should be cared for; it should be reared to carry the next generation forward. Now, that can only be done, as I see it, by legitimate marriage. Because the law will come in there and help the woman to have a way to support that child. I realize in the Negro family, under the regime of slavery, the family was not important to her; she could let the proprietor of the plantation have full possession of the child, even sell it, if he so desired. But if she is going to care for a child in this day and time, I firmly believe in marriage, having the law to protect her in the rearing of the child that she has brought into the world. It gives the man responsibility and makes him a real being. You're not just an animal. I saw a film last night on the tiger, how he mates and immediately leaves. He knows nothing of the care of those cubs. That's the mother's responsibility. And when a man does that, I feel he is no more than a tiger.
GFB: Okay then, Mrs. Adams. In moving away from that direction, I was wondering if you could perhaps tell us a little bit about some of the places that you have visited either in the United States or abroad, for that matter.
KA: Well, I have not been abroad, only in the armchair. I am a great armchair traveler. But I have covered the eastern United States beginning down in the northern part of Florida, visiting the schools down in that area that﻿29
(cont.) are pertinent to our development. In that I have lived in Georgia... maybe I haven't done enough traveling in Georgia, but I have been to the historic spots in Savannah, and on up into Augusta; just touched barely in Athens where we have the University of Georgia. From there, through Tennessee, touching into Memphis and on up into Ohio. Touching a little in Detroit, then Cleveland and Chicago, noting the trend of society in each of these places. I attended a convention in Ohio as a delegate for the auxiliary to the Alliance of Postal Employees. I had quite a stay there and it was very interesting to talk with the people and note their differences in views and even in language. In Chicago, it was the year of the World's Fair. Most of my time was spent there. I didn't see quite as much of the city as I wanted to see, because usually I would often go to the historic spots, museums.
From there, I circled on through the northern part of Pennsylvania into New York City. That was not my first time to New York City; I'd been to New York City when I was quite a young woman. It was interesting and very beautiful to see the changes that had been made in New York City where our people were concerned. I did go back and go over the museums and other places, even to Coney Island, an amusement park. But most of my time was spent downtown in public libraries—very interesting to me, that type of browsing. After New York, I visited in Massachusetts, the city of Worcester, where I had relatives. And that was quite a change from Georgia. Our people are not as outgoing there as they are in the South. I think we moved in a freer way, and the opportunities for Negroes in Georgia, I find, are far ahead of those in the state of Massachusetts. I took side trips on up into New Hampshire and Vermont. I was able to see the Great Stone Face and the beautiful mountains of that section. Coming on back I saw one of the most beautiful sunrises I've ever seen in my life. It was simply magnificent. I will long remember it. Coming on back through New York and on down, close on the coast, I entered Maryland and went on into Washington City. That was not my first trip to Washington City; I went there on my first trip up in 1917. And of course I redid Washington, took in the historical spots and, as I say, browsed in the Library of Congress. Went again to Rock Creek Park and enjoyed the flora there. And then on down through the Carolinas to home.
Then in the late fifties, I decided it was time to see the West, so I left Atlanta with a tour. We went down as our first stop to Montgomery, which, of course, is always put on the tour and given recognition in that it was the seat of the Confederacy. From there we went to New Orleans, and there we have our schools still in existence that were initiated by the American Missionary Association. Then we went to the French Quarter, of course, and made a thorough survey of the French market and the section that is devoted more or less to our people. It so happened though, it was the college town of the area. There we found a motel that was very interesting, probably one of the largest manned by one of our group in the South. It was a very lovely place; everything that one could wish for in a motel, he had under his roof. From there we went on along that southern trail through New Mexico and on to California. And of course we did the usual thing that you do in California—Los Angeles and San Francisco and all of the pertinent﻿30
KA: (cont.) spots there. It was all very Interesting. The foliage, the
vegetation was more lush than it was in Georgia; it was very interesting to view it. Then on the curve of the return, of course, we went to the Grand Canyon, and over... Before we left California though, I must speak of the redwoods. Oh, just to look up and see that cathedral of green carried you heavenward, and you really thought that you were floating upward. The peace that came over you from standing under their archway is something that everyone should experience. And then as I say, we went to the Grand Canyon, and of course we went over—what is it, the song calls it—Route 66, I believe, and that night we went over it at night and we had a deal of fun over that. I think more or less some of us were frightened; the driver was a little bit rough on the road, and he kept talking to keep himself awake.
GFB: Was it a car or bus?
KA: A bus, yes, we had a bus. I think we had twenty-eight on that bus. But we had a Jolly time that night, and we rode . on and reached Little Rock by daybreak. And it was just after the disturbance out there, but you would never know it; it was a beautiful place. The streets were beautiful, the homes well cared for. On back through Tennessee, on down to Georgia, that was the most enjoyable tour, because I think I took in just about everything that I had read about it, and I am an armchair traveler.
I traveled to California in my imagination when I first started reading. My parents took National Geographic, and they had bought a set of books on the national parks. And I remember sitting in the big rocking chair on the front porch with my legs crossed, a big book across my knees, going in and out of the parks and buildings when I was a child. It took me a couple of years probably to go through all of those books, but I said then, "When I get grown, I'm going." So I did go, I think, in '57.
I hope someday I can get back to the very Northwest of the United States. There are three states up there that I haven't touched—and I haven't touched Maine, I didn't get into Maine. But other than that, I have been over the United States. Now I am traveling, or did travel, a summer a year ago in imagination to Europe with one of my young friends. She went over to study at Oxford, and she would write me and tell me of what she was seeing and doing. And after school was over, she went on the Continent and lo and behold, one day I received a package and I had them in my hand the other day, pictures. So I am hoping that my next friend who goes in May will do the same. I'm going to think of her as she goes from place to place during this month of May, and I am hoping that she will also bring back something for me to handle.
GFB: Okay, at this particular time then, Mrs. Adams, I was wondering if you would like to say anything that I haven't asked you?
KA: Yes, I would. I would like to show how the educational setup began in Atlanta. It is well known that Atlanta is the focal point for Negro education here in the South. The Atlanta University complex is known all over the country—I should say, all over the world, because we have any﻿31
KA: (cont.) number of foreign students attending. ' Just a little history on
the Negroes' entrance into Atlanta should be stated. When the AMA decided to have this Atlanta as a center they sent Edmund Asa Ware, Dr. Cravath, and Reverend Francis, all who had been working in the North with the association. President Ware, along with the other two men covered Georgia, going to the plantations and telling the freedmen of this school that was to be established in Atlanta. It finally was established and became the Storr School. They asked key mothers from four sections of Georgia to come to Atlanta and work with them, preceding the students who would come, who had no families, finding places for them to reside in other established homes in Atlanta. From the southeast came Anne Bomer, from Washington, Georgia. Also from that section came Betsy Rucker. From the northeastern section, up around Athens and into Tennessee, came Georgia Payne and her sister, Mrs. Turner. From the northwest came Sybil Carter, who was the mother of E.R. [Edward Randolph] Carter. From the northwest came also Ellen Morgan, who was one of the charter members of the First Congregational Church of Atlanta. From the southwest came Louisa Redding. These worked faithfully in helping with the educational setup. In a few years, it was noticeable that that had been accomplished. Atlanta University was educating teachers, girls, in a normal course at Atlanta University. I'd like to mention just here those who did some of the first work, who opened the doors in Atlanta to education.
GFB: Excuse me, I was wondering, Mrs. Adams, what was the role of the key mother? Could you explain that?
KA: Yes, the key mother was to receive the students. Now, you know after the Emancipation, Negroes were just floating about on the plantations—nowhere to go, nothing particularly to do. So, as I said before, the American Missionary Association looked into that and sent workers to this area. These workers went about over the state and got women, and they voted on them, so my grandmother said. The community chose a woman that would come here, get herself established with the aid of Mr. Francis, Reverend Francis of the First Congregational Church who was principal of the Storr School, and get places for them to stay.
Now, these mothers at first stayed in the boxcars, and under the old terminal station's plateau there, where there were slave cabins belonging to the Peters family. Now they worked out from there with the children that were brought in; some of these children were just boys, say, fifteen, sixteen years old, who had no connection, but were bright young people who needed to be educated. These mothers would find homes for these boys, take them into their home or the home of friends, and even sometimes, into the homes of some of the whites. Because, say what you will or may, many of those children were sponsored by these white families who were not in favor so much of the segregation as some of them are today. They took them in their homes, some of them, educated them right along with their children, in many ways. These were called key mothers because they opened the door. And made a way for these children to come in. Now there were families that came as a family. You take R.R. [Richard Robert] Wright's mother. She was able to get a ride with the man that had formerly owned her and she worked, at least, on the plantation. She rode on the buggy with her﻿32
KA: (cont.) little daughter, but her son, R.R. Wright as we know him, walked all the way from Albany, Georgia, up to Atlanta to be able to join his mother and be put into school. And they were commonly called, these women— as I say, Mrs. Bomer, Mrs. Rucker, Mrs. Payne, Turner, Carter, Morgan and Redding—were called key mothers.
And I would like to mention some of the fruits of this work. Of course, the young children in the beginning went to the Storr School. From the Storr School they were piloted to Atlanta University, and by 1873, Atlanta was turning out its first normal class at the university. Now out of the normal division of Atlanta University the first teachers, colored teachers, for the public schools of Atlanta, came. The first one, two in number were from the class of '78. They were Indiana Clark, who became a Mrs. Pitts, Ella Townsley, who also became Mrs. Pitts. Mrs. Julia Turner of the very first class of '73 was the first woman to become an assistant principal in the Atlanta Board of Education's public schools. The first supervisor was M. Agnes Jones. She graduated from Atlanta University in 1892, the normal department, as a Mary Agnes Boswell. Another first in education was Mary Sue Goosby, who became a Mrs. Cranely. She was from the class of 1884. Her attainment was the first permanent certificate of teaching from the state of Georgia.
Now I would like to mention...yes, I would like to mention the emergence of social work in Atlanta. Out of the turmoil of the Negro's plight, we had women who began to think and to work toward a better life for the Negro here in Atlanta. There was a woman named Mary Crawley, who worked with the prisoner and his family. She was known all over town for her ardent endeavors to stifle crime and to lift the living standard of what we now call the underprivileged. Her name should long be remembered. We did not have transportation as we have now, and she walked, and you could see her many a day tired, shoulders beginning to droop, but^she was on her way to aid some family. Another one that must be recalled was Georgia Swift King. She was from one of the first classes in Atlanta University— in fact, she was of the second class of '74. She chose to be a city-wide missionary, dealing mostly with the alcoholic and his family. She lived to a ripe old age and was still working at her death. Further down the line in the social area we had such women as Selena Mae Sloan Butler, a graduate of Spelman Seminary, who was a club organizer, and along working at the same time was Alice Dugged Cary, who finally became the first Negro
librarian for the city. She was an assistant at the___she had charge of
the Negro division.
GFB: Now what time period was this, do you know what year that was?
KA: It was 1921 when the city first put up a library for Negroes, still segregated. Of course, you know today we have just seen Mrs. Yates installed as head of the city library—I believe her name is Ella Yates. Going further down the social line, the first real social work investigator
or visitor paid by the city was Hattie Jay Cater, a classmate of mine___the
class of 1911, Atlanta University. From then on, many a social worker has served the city, and we have come down now to Johnny Moats Johnson, who retired this month, I believe. She has worked in the juvenile department﻿33
KA: (cont.) for many, many years.
I would like to speak here on firsts in politics. From one of Atlanta University's first classes, the class of 1877, came Lavinia Wimbish, whose brother was collector of the port of Atlanta. As a small child I remember her assisting at the polls. When you saw Miss Lavinia coming, you knew what her subject was going to be—"We've got to get to the polls and vote. We'll never be able to accomplish anything without the vote." That, of course, has been a slogan in Atlanta right straight on down through the years to Grace Hamilton, who is now in the Georgia state legislature. She graduated as Grace Towns,, from Atlanta University, and is now a trustee also of Atlanta University. That is the beginning, and Grace Towns Hamilton is representative of what the Negro in Atlanta can accomplish.
One thing we have not mentioned, and Atlanta has to recognize this in the social work field, and that is the establishment of the Carrie Steele Orphan Home by a woman way back at the latter part of the seventies. She found several children on a seat in the railroad station where she was a maid. She took them home, and she commenced soliciting to help them. The First Congregational Church came to her aid through their missionary, and through the years they helped to support the organization. Mrs. Steele married, remarried, and passed on the whole, though it was still under the umbrella of the church. The church treasurer was also the treasurer of the institution. He married the widow of Lee B. Maxwell, the international secretary of the YMCA. She became interested in the work, and as it went on, the name of the institution was changed somewhere about 1937 or 1938 to the Carr ie Steele Pitts Home, in honor of the wonderful work that she did for the institution. The county has taken it over, and it is one of the best run institutions of that type in the South.
GFB: Did she ever get any aid from the white community in running her home?
KA: No, she didn't get aid from the white community, but probably in 1913,
somewhere in there, Fulton County, the county in which we live, established a social work service, and I can't tell you just how long after they did establish things there that they did take on Carrie Steele Home. It was still Carrie Steele Home when they took it on, supporting most of the children in the home. Now the home did take in besides those that were in from the county and from the juvenile detention home, in fact, it was used at one time... I supplied there as a matron, at one time, and during that time I had charge of children in the home who were, or should have been cared for by the juvenile department downtown. They did not have the proper accommodations for them at that time, because the building was being torn down to be replaced by the home out on Broad Street. I believe the courthouse was put on that spot downtown, and the children were finally transferred to a building out on Broad. The aid, as I say, came for the children who came under the county's care, but Mrs. Pitts also took in children whose mothers worked in service, probably lived on the premises where they worked, and needed a home for their children. There was a slight boarding fee that was asked for them, and the church, and the city and any friends who wished, contributed to make up the deficit that was﻿34
KA: (cont.) needed in that instance.
The girls who were there when I was there—I went there at first as a teacher of what we called domestic science, that was the sewing and the cooking—the girls, fourteen, fifteen years old, were given that training. Out of the girls that were there when I was there, I have kept up with the majority of them, and they have made reputable citizens here in Atlanta. Some in secretarial work, some in nursing. One got a chance to go overseas in the army. Mrs. Pitts's daughter at present is directing the home, but it is one of the stars in Atlanta's crown.
On your slip here I see the name of Peter J. Bryant, who was a pastor at the old Wheat Street Church, at the corner of Auburn and Port Streets. The church is named Wheat Street; it's on Auburn Avenue. It got its name, "Wheat," from the first name of Auburn Avenue. Auburn Avenue was first called Wheat Street. And may I say, since I am on Wheat Street, the first colored woman to own property in Atlanta was a Mary Coombs, who owned a piece of property at the head of Auburn Avenue, at the intersection of Peachtree, where we have one section of Central Park. She was a freedwoman, and she set in to buy her husband out of slavery. And they lived on this piece of property that she also bought. Bishop Henry McNeal Turner was the first chaplain, Negro chaplain in the U.S. Army. We have a school in Atlanta, a high school, that is named for him. Also I see here Reverend A.D. Williams, who was the grandfather of Martin Luther King, Jr. They were neighbors, personal friends. I saw him build a wonderful church; he had a small congregation on the back street, and he wanted his congregation to have a church on what he called a front street, so he brought it to the corner of Auburn Avenue and Jackson Street, one-half block below my birthplace.
GFB: Oh Auburn Avenue?
KA: Mm hmm. A very interesting spot. The piece of property had belonged to Alan J. Dolbridge, who first organized the deacon board in the First Congregational Church, way back in the latter part of the eighties. I also see here Mrs. Adrienne McNeil Herndon who taught dramatics at Atlanta University. She was the mother of Norris Herndon, whose father, Alfonso Herndon, founded the Atlanta Life Insurance Company, about the second largest Negro insurance company in the United States. A very brilliant woman, and a very beautiful woman. Also I see Professor Towns's name here. He was the English teacher that I knew. He was a Harvard graduate. First he was a graduate of the Atlanta University class of '94; then on to Harvard he went, and took his master's in English. He was a landmark at Atlanta University, and I should say the father of Grace Towns Hamilton, our state representative. President Bumstead was my president when I was in Atlanta University. Dr. Myron Adams became the president of Atlanta University just before I left. Their work, of course, is known all over the country. Here I see the name of Benjamin Davis, Sr., usually just called Ben Davis. He was the editor of the Atlanta Independent, a Negro paper published here in Atlanta under the auspices of the Odd Fellows.
GFB: I think you said that you wanted to talk a little bit more about two more personalities.﻿35
KA: Yes, two more of Atlanta University's graduates who were the firsts.
That's what I was talking on to do, just there are so many in Atlanta, there's no way to mention all of them. But those who have opened doors are very interesting, I think. There was a Mabel Hurt, who finished Atlanta University in 1905, I believe. She finally married a man named Bullard, a printer. Now after some years they decided to go to New York City to live. Mabel wrote a book on teaching tactics, and that book has been used by the city and the state, I think, of New York, as a textbook in teaching and training the teacher for classroom work. That, I think, is something commendable and mentionable. The other first was Janie B. Cunningham, who finished Atlanta University in 1906. After some teaching experience in Atlanta, she finally went to New York City, and became the first Negro principal of a city school. She did not work in her district, but was appointed to a district that was patronized, more or less, by the upper class of residents of the city. I should say the wealthy class of the city.
GFB: Today is May 3, 1977. This is an interview with Mrs. Kathleen Adams at
her home at 970 Palmetto Avenue, Southwest, Atlanta, Georgia. Mrs. Adams, the last time you talked with Dr. Rowley, you said that your father had secured a position at the Merchants Bank in Atlanta. I was wondering if we could continue with that today.
KA: Yes, we can. He secured this job in the first of the 1880s, being
assigned as teller and cashier for Negro accounts in this Merchants Bank. The president of the bank was a James H. Porter. This bank finally decided to dissolve the [board] who managed the bank, [and they] saw a need for more banks in Atlanta. Out of the group came the First National Bank of Atlanta, the Lowry National Bank of Atlanta, the Third National Bank of Atlanta, which finally went into the Citizens [Trust Bank] and southern groupings in later years. My father stayed there until probably 1896 or 1897. Now on the side, he had a little job.
But going back to the officers of the Merchants Bank, we find that he was advised to go among his people, the Negro people, and start a loan association. Most of the Negro business with the bank had been in the form of loans," probably a few deposits, but on the recommendation of my father... He was advised to start a loan association of four Negroes, and this he did in 1891. A group of responsible men were gathered, and by 1895 when the Cotton StatesExposition came to Atlanta, they had purchased two corners down in Auburn Avenue. Diagonal corners at Bell and Auburn, one piece on the northeastern corner, and the other on the southwestern corner. And I am very happy to say today that that property, although the association is not functioning and did not function after 1906, that piece of property has never changed hands. We are down to three of the founders, fathers of carrying certificates and shares in that property. About 1895, that property was improved for the section of the exposition and visitors that were coming into Atlanta. On the northeastern corner, the building was turned into a hotel, and called the European Hotel. The funds gleaned from that venture finished paying for the property.﻿36
KA: (cont.) Then my father had another little side job after he went to the Virginia-Carolina Chemical Company's shipping clerk's position. There he had charge of the shipping. In that he was known to the business section of Alabama—Peach tree, Whitehall, I believe it is, and Broad— and he was very cognizant of the need for janitorial help for the offices in that area, and he fought to get two women, the first that were known to do that type of work up in town. These two women headed a group of high school boys who cleaned those offices every day after their school hours. For the boy who was trying to go to high school there was very little in Atlanta for them to do. Men who wanted young boys' labor wanted it all day. But this janitorial service gave the high schoolboy a chance to help himself somewhat.
The law study that my father went through stayed with him until his death. He was generally advisor for the settlement in anything that pertained to law, especially civil law. He was quick to see the needs of young businessmen as they set themselves in the Auburn Avenue business section. Instead of banking savings, he took what he could save and invested it in these little businesses to help them to carry on. That continued until his death. After World War I, it was evident that the colored boy was having a hard time staying in college. Some of the little funds that my father had accumulated was applied to tuitions. He would make loans to the brighter type of student. All in all, he was a person who was always looking forward and trying to push the Negro youth ahead.
GFB: I was wondering if we could sort of go back and talk a little bit more
about your brothers and sisters. Mainly I was wondering if you could tell us, did they also attend school at Atlanta University?
KA: Now there were four of us, two girls and two boys. Three of us did attend the university. The first brother went north at the age of sixteen to live with relatives, and he did not attend Atlanta University. The other brother, George Henry, lacked one year of finishing the high school, there; he went to the tobacco farm in New Jersey to work during the summer, and he met with some treatment that he was not accustomed to have down here.
GFB: What kind of treatment?
KA: Well, the overseer of the tobacco field had a way of cursing, and that was something that was forbidden in our household, and the type of people that were around us did not curse. He resented this, and caught the train and went to New York City to his older brother and he did not return to Atlanta.
But my sister, Ethel Charlotte, and I completed the normal course of Atlanta University. She finished in the class of 1915, and I finished in 1911. Both of us became public schoolteachers here in Atlanta. I taught for around about twelve years before I married. At that time when one married, that was the end of that tenure with the Atlanta Board of Education. My sister stayed in Atlanta until after the death of my mother, and then she went out of town to work, first to Tennessee, and then finally in Virginia, and she is still in Virginia. She became a supervisor of music in Richmond, Virginia, and worked there for a number of years. She is now retired. And﻿37
KA: (cont.) of course, I have been retired some near eighteen years.
Now the younger brother, and I should say both of the brothers in a way, were like their father. They wanted to show the way, and actually both of them were what I call the restless type. If they were not forging ahead, they seemed to have been miserable. Restless. The older brother when he was eighteen did take the examination for the police force there in New York City, and he wasn't on the force very long before he was moved to a sergeant. And at his death in 1924, he was the first Negro to become a sergeant of detectives on New York's finest. George Henry, the youngest of our group, first worked in the post office in New York City. His assignment caused him to work at night only. He worked in the Spanish division, the outgoing mail, but he decided that working at night all the time, he'd never get a chance to see his family, because his days had to be spent mostly in sleep. So he took the examination for the police force there in the city, and he was assigned to the juvenile division, they called it "prevention of crime." He worked with that for a number of years, becoming a sergeant, and then, in that he was advancing ahead of any other person who was Negro in the force, he was taken out. And he was very proud that all of his progress was made through examinations. He became a lieutenant, and at his death—well, before that, in '53—he became a captain. And then at his death, he was in command of the Bedford-Stuyvesant precinct in Brooklyn. He was deputy chief inspector, and was the ranking Negro on the force, and one little magazine printed that he was the ranking Negro policeman in the United States at his death.
GFB: Mrs. Adams, I know that you are a member of First Congregational Church, and I was wondering, were your parents also members?
KA: My father was a member. The church was founded in 1867. He was a little boy attending the first school for Negroes, which was the Storr School, supported by the American Missionary Association, and my grandmother, his mother, Louisa Redding, was assisting the teachers at the school. I think I recall that she was called a key mother, and had charge of looking for places for unhoused students to reside as they came into town. Now the church was founded by the school, and the principal of the school was first minister of the church, Reverend Francis, and Edmund Asa Ware was the first clerk of that church. Well, my father was there to hear the initial sermon preached by Dr. Cravath, who founded Fisk University. So he was one of the ones for which the church was established. He became officially a member about 1872, and of course, he was funeralized from the church as a member.
My mother was brought up in the Storr School, and the Sunday school of the First Congregational Church. But when she was ready to join a church, her grandmother, who had been brought up in an antebellum Methodist family, asked her to go with her cousins and all join the Methodist church. She joined Big Bethel, which was the outstanding Methodist church in our area, and one of the older churches in Atlanta. I believe it came into being about two years before the First Congregational Church. It was well﻿38
(cont.) established and had such ministers as Bishop Turner, who was, as I stated before, the first Negro chaplain of the United States Army, a leader, of course, in the city. And there was a Bishop [Joseph] Flipper— I think my mother joined under him—and I am in proud possession of the photograph of Bishop Flipper; he was Reverend Flipper at that time. It was a custom in the Methodist church for the pastor to give his picture to the ones that he had taken into the church, and to those who had been married under his dictates.
My father never stopped attending the First Congregational Church, and he decided that I should be christened in the First Congregational Church, so I am on record there as of December 14, 1890. I must mention also a Reverend Fitman that was at the church. I attended the young people's league, I think it was called the Epworth League, and I was rather small. Reverend Fitman had three interesting daughters that I should mention. Everyone was trying to forge ahead at that particular time, and in that we did not have very many places of entertainment for Negroes in Atlanta, these three sisters, although they were minister's daughters, formed more or less a theatrical troupe. They performed in the city, and then they went on road tours. They were a most interesting group.
The very oldest daughter, May, was a coloratura soprano. The next daughter, Ese, the coal black wave of hair and a creamy complexion, rather robust, was a contralto. Then there was Alberta, still younger, who had a mezzo-soprano voice. To add to this troupe, they secured a little boy that they called Little Willy. He was under fifteen, I think, when they first took him in; he couldn't have been more than ten years old. And then there was a little girl in the troupe that they called Baby May. This group performed usually in what was called Turner's Tabernacle; that was a tent of enormous size that was Bishop Turner's side lot on Young Street. Atlanta would pack that tent for the Fitmans' performance. They advertised themselves in a parade down Auburn Avenue the day of their performance, and it was a sight to see. At that time automobiles were not in evidence on the streets of Atlanta, so they rode in what they call landaus, the tops thrown back, the driver sitting high on the seat in front, and beside him, an announcer with a trumpet. First rode May, all by herself in this landau. The next was Ese, and maybe someone with her. Then Alberta, and winding up the parade would be Little Willy dressed in long trousers, and Little May in a white or a blue sheer dress with a fairy wand in her hand and a little crown on her head. Their program went from the arias of the operas, managed by May. Ese sang the ballads, and religious songs. Alberta did the popular music. Little Willy and Baby May did the dancing, sang some. Their big feature was what was called the cakewalk, and that brought down the house always, and closed the program. It was a very interesting entertainment. Clean, and progressive. It used ideas. Probably that's the first idea we had of operatic singing, under that old tent, with the Fitman sisters. They should always be remembered in Atlanta as furnishing the music for the better type of people in the area.
Okay then, I would like to thank you on behalf of the Schlesinger Library's Black Women Oral History Project. I want to thank you very much for giving﻿39
GFB: (cont.) us your time.
KA: Well, I appreciate that, and I'm happy to do this, because I have lived
in the midst of it, and although I am a resident of Atlanta, and a graduate of Atlanta University, what has been done by the city at large and the university , where Negroes are concerned, should be recorded.﻿KATHLEEN ADAMS
