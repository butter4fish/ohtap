Gay Francine Banks:	This is Gay Francine Banks interviewing Miss
Frankie Adams on April 20, 1977. Miss Adams, when were you born?
Frankie Adams:	Well, now, let's see, I was born in Danville,
Kentucky, which is best classified as a rural part of Danville. And Danville, of course, is in Boyle County, Kentucky. My father and mother were engaged in what you call truck gardening. At one time I recall that my father had three wagons going each day three miles to the little town to sell vegetables. And these vegetables were all kinds of things, with the exception of collard greens and spinach; we weren't able to raise spinach at that time. And the general variety of cooking vegetables was what he had to raise. Now my mother, as a part of her contribution, made butter regularly, and I had to churn as I grew up, and I didn't like the idea of churning... but then, nevertheless, making butter was part of the production of my family. Now actually, my folks were quite unable to have enough land of their own to really grow much; but by the time my father had added little portions of land from a white man...a Mr. Lee was one, Mr. Joseph Lee was one of the people and the other person was... I guess his name was Will Johnson; I think he was called Will Johnson. These were the people who had nearby land, which my father used on a partnership basis to increase his production. I didn't tell you when I was born, did I?
Gay Francine Banks:	No.
Frankie Adams:	1902. July 9, 1902. And I remained, for the
most part, in Danville or the county of Boyle until I was about eight years of age. And then I went to live with a sister of mine who was married and living in Detroit and Bay City, Michigan. Her husband was traveling, and she had no children. She wanted me to be with her so that she had some company when her husband was traveling on the railroad.
Gay Francine Banks:
So how many brothers and sisters did you have?﻿2
FA: I had a total of seven brothers and sisters. There were actually eight, but I don't know anything about one of them. She apparently died in her birth. Three sisters and three brothers. And these sisters and brothers came in so-called pairs. My mother used to refer to "my other children," talking about the older ones. And then she called us the "you children." Now the "you children" were always regarded as so different from the "other children" in terms of adjustment and behavior and interests. Which of course is characteristic of our times today.
GFB: Which number were you?
FA: I was in the "you children." I'm the youngest of the family, actually the eighth.
GFB: So do you still have close contact with your brothers and sisters now?
FA: No, I'm afraid all three brothers are dead. And two of the sisters are confined in convalescent homes of one kind or the other. One sister is ninety-five years of age and the other one is ninety-one; the other one is up in her eighties. There's a twenty-year difference between my older sister and me. These sisters have residences in Bay City, Michigan; Detroit; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Here I am in Atlanta, and the only sisters that I have are somewhere else. And travel is a problem for me. After all, we are cut off these days, from family, really, except for writing, telephoning and a few letters from the sisters' children.
GFB: I was wondering if you could tell me something about your grandparents.
FA: I know very little about the grandparents. My mother's mother I did
know, but she died in my youth. My mother's name was Trumbo; I was quite young when she [my grandmother] was an old lady.
GFB: So I was wondering, do you remember any significant events or any influential person from the childhood that sort of motivated you to go in the direction that you went in?
FA: Well, not in childhood, per _se. Specific motivation came after entering Knoxville College for high School and college. Well, when I came home, back to Danville, I believe it was the influence of my mother that kept all of us in school, rather than the influence of my father. And actually, I had to do my grammar school work going back and forth to school with two brothers from the country to Danville, until they got out of school. And then it became necessary for my mother and father to put me in somebody else's home, in the town, so I could attend the Danville school that we had at that time—Bates High School, they called it, Bates Elementary School and a regular high school. And B.W. Bates was the controlling force.
But I didn't stay with them, I stayed with a family by the name of Jones, Dr. B.F. Jones. And Dr. Jones had three children whom I would say I played with and enjoyed quite a lot. The oldest daughter, who was referred to as Julia, Julia Mitchell Jones, is presently living in Louisville, Kentucky, and I regarded her as my "play ma." And I would think﻿3
FA: (cont.) she had a pretty good influence on me. She attended school at
Spelman, and taught at Spelman, in the home economics department, but that wasn't what they called it at the time. It was "domestic science," way back then. But she's still living, and visited me here last year, and we went over a number of the childhood contacts that we had. I would say that in general, she had a strong influence on me. Oh, there's another family that I have to mention too, that of the Reverend J.E. Wood, who was a pastor. He had some daughters: Orontes was the oldest one, and Ophelia was the other, my age, and Virginia was the other, the youngest. And I was under that family's influence for a couple of years. So you have a kind of childhood influence which I had really felt was pretty important, for continuing contact aside from my own home. I was usually at home for weekends.
GFB: You talked a little bit about your education, and I was wondering if you
could sort of go back to that for a minute. You said you attended primary school at Bates Elementary?
FA: That's right.
GFB: And from there you went where?
FA: Stony Point, a rural one-room number, which started out as an elementary school, and then it gave you some high school. But I didn't attend high school there. And my brothers were closest to me as I came along, brother Montague and brother James. James was the youngest. Now a war came in there, 1918 sometime or another, and it became necessary for me to attend school somewhere other than Danville. So my father sent me to Knoxville College when I got out of the elementary school in Danville, Kentucky. So I spent eight years at Knoxville College during the high school years and in a department called McGill. And then, college, after I got old enough to go to college. I did college work there and completed my college work in 1925. And it was during the college years that I had contact with the YWCA. The school of the YWCA at Knoxville College was a very active opportunity for participation, for black people. I would say that the school of the YWCA was probably in the South the main kind of general socializing, or social kind of a movement for the Negro person of that age. I am saying "Negro" on purpose, because that's the way we were referred to at that time. The opportunities for developing the leadership of the students were in their dealing with the setup of the national student movement. There were both men and women to my recall, one or as many as three people who were connected with this national student movement of the YWCA. All were colored, black. Frances Williams of Saint Louis, Missouri; Julia Derricott of Athens, Georgia; and Juanita Saddler. Now, I don't know where Juanita came from, but she was one of three national student secretaries who had great influence. I would say that Frances Williams had a major influence on me, in regard to the YWCA student movement... But that's part of the education and final career choice. Frances Williams was a graduate social worker; I think she was one of the first black ones in the nation to have her full credit for a master's degree in social work. Whether it was that... I think she's had her master's degree, I'm not sure. But we were friends and she had enormous influence in encouraging me to go on to graduate school after I left college, and so it was that I﻿4
FA: (cont.) did finish college in 1925. And I immediately got myself enrolled at the New York School of Social Work, now known as the Columbia University School of Social Work. I took the diploma there; at that time the school was not giving degrees. I subsequently went back, and took my degree by transferring some of the diploma credits to New York University.
GFB: What type of activities did one do as a member of the YWCA? Social...
FA: It was social... I would say that you could call it recreational education, I believe, in that period of time. In that the work of the YWCA was developing Christian leadership for all girls, at the age where a mixed group of girls, wherever we met, had in general combined meetings. I can recall one of these meetings in Danville with Spelman. I was at the time enrolled at Knoxville College and sent as a delegate to this conference. All the little black girls stayed out at Rockefeller Hall and the white ones stayed at various places in town—probably at the white YWCA, I don't know where they stayed—but anyway, I do recall staying at Rockefeller Hall, and got back there late one night around 10:30 p.m. and couldn't get in— the doors were locked—so I had to throw some little pebbles and things on the windows. Someone came down and unlatched the door so I could get inside. But these were conferences that had training, and activities related to them, entirely focused on the idea of developing a basic leadership within these organizations.
GFB: Okay, I was wondering if you could sort of go back for a minute. What was your parents' attitude toward your getting an education, as a female?
FA: Well, I wouldn't say that there was any... I don't think there was any
reaction to it. I would say no adverse reaction. After all, the two boys always in my segment of family were more or less away from home, and the matter of getting the girl to have some education was one way of taking care of the situation. There was no way in the world that she could live; there was nothing that she could get into in the way of work, or of that sort. Now this was not true with the other children of the family; the older girls had only, I would say, maybe eighth grade or what might be called a ninth or tenth grade, but they didn't graduate from high school or college. They got jobs. But you see, I came along as a stray in the period of time when there were not too many jobs for girls of my age, you see. And it was protection for me to go to and be in school.
GFB: Right. So were there many other black families that lived in Danville?
FA: There were, I would say... We were fairly well distributed in terms of
population, but not too many black families of Danville sent their children off to school. The Joneses did, the Woods, that I have named, sent theirs off. There were, to my knowledge, about four or five other families during my time who went off, as they call it, to school. There was one man who came to Knoxville while I was at school. He said he retired from teaching in Danville and went into business for himself as an antique finisher. You see, this is quite a span of years you're thinking about.
GFB: Right. So that if a young lady didn't go off to school like the way you did, I mean, what type of job would she do?﻿5
FA: Housework, or some kind of bus girl work in hotels, or small...we had about two little hotels I knew in Danville when I was a young girl. There wasn't too much that she could do. My own work time when I was home summers was spent helping my father and mother carry on their activities in the truck garden, in the preparation of the milk, the chickens, and stuff like that.
GFB: So were there many instances of young ladies being married at an early age?
FA: To my knowledge, this was not a problem within the social setting that I moved in.
GFB: Well, what about recreational activities; what did you do for relaxation?
FA: We went to church. [laughter] And we played ball, when we had time. We went to church and when we came back, I can recall the kids, going to church and coming back, and getting all the kids out in the country that 1 knew, yelling in the road, and taking off on whatever the preacher had preached that Sunday; I'd preach it. But not too much organized recreation for a small town in my youth.
GFB: So that church, more or less, was the...
FA: ...center of activity, social activity. Church and Sunday school, picnics, social clubs, dinners.
GFB: So has the fact that you are a Negro, and female, affected your purpose and role in life?
FA: To my knowledge, no. You see, one of the things that happened—and my father was a truck driver—one of the things that happened was that the white owner had three children; one was a girl, the others were boys. And when my mother would take on a special job with this white family, or any white family, for that matter, I went with her as a kid, and these boys and this girl comprised my "family." We would play like husband and play like mama to the younger children. So all this is to say that you develop, this develops in the individual a certain kind of interplay that was something I just know sort of later was true in relation to the Carter family down here in Plains, Georgia—part of the tradition, the sort of experiences that I went through. I don't know whether you've seen that or not, but in some articles, the article tells about how Jimmie had a little black boy and girl as playmates. And when he was working and on the job, they were in school with white children. This was the kind of process which was pretty characteristic of the life experience we gave to one another in the period of which I'm talking. I don't want to get on that, but since by comparison for what was picked up later...since we had efforts to desegregate the schools, you have another kind of clash there, which was not characteristic of my early girlhood.
GFB: So then you really...I mean, there wasn't that sort of animosity toward the white people; do you have a feeling of...
FA: No, I have no animosity toward them. And I have purposefully, over the years, developed an attitude of... I will not, I refuse to make a white﻿6
FA: (cont.) person mad at me under any circumstance, and this is part of my Christian belief, I believe, rather than anything else. This doesn't mean now that I have not felt disturbed by things that white people did before, or do to me after... I recall, for example, going on a field work trip from the Atlanta School of Social Work. I thought I was going to get all dressed up and I was in the Pullman. And a white lady got a very bad headache, and she had to go in the restroom and nobody was there to help her, so the Pullman porter knew me and asked me if I wouldn't give this woman some assistance. I said, "Yes, I'd be glad to." And so I went in and I gave her the necessary assistance. So she wanted to know how it was that I was on this Pullman going through to Boston. And I told her, in a joking manner—a serious manner, really, but as far as she was concerned, she didn't know—and I said, "Well, I work for a white woman who was very generous, and she gave me a vacation, and I'm on my way to Boston for my vacation." Here I was all dressed up and so forth. So I have used what some of the folks say, "devilment" reaction to bypass some of the key things that could have been a problem, you know.
GFB: So when was this? What was the time period; was this in the twenties?
FA: No, no, no. This was before I left the Atlanta School of Social Work, about 1959. I left the School of Social Work in 1964.
GFB: Well, earlier, you had mentioned the church as being more or less the center of social activity in your home town...
FA: In small towns, yes.
GFB: In small towns, and I was wondering, did everybody in your town more or less belong to the church?
FA: Well, I couldn't answer that, but I would say that your so-called better class or economically secure people belonged to some kind of church. As I recall, there were four churches in Danville in which Negroes were members: the First Baptist Church; an A.M.E. church; a Christian church, as they called it, which changed its name, I believe, in recent years; and then there was a Holiness church. I do not recall too much about it as a child, but in later years I did have contact with it, the Holiness church. But each of these churches had its element of influence upon certain economic and social groupings in the community.
GFB: Did the church that you attended have many activities? Did they have, like, cookouts, or picnics, or anything like that?
FA: Oh, we had church picnics, and we had church suppers and church dinners, and things of that sort, Christmas plays. We had outside speakers to come, and even a few went to state and national conventions about 1963; my church had got the means to come up there and for me to come back and to introduce someone to the people there. So that the church had, I would say, relatively
speaking___not too poor, it had some richness to it. Thanksgiving dinners...
one of the times that I got so mad at my ma, I had traveled all night from Atlanta to be back in Danville with her for Thanksgiving, only to find out﻿7
FA: (cont.) that she wasn't cooking dinner for me, she was going to the church to have dinner; and so, she was helping at the church. And so I had to go over there to the church for this Thanksgiving dinner. Traveled all night that I should be with her. Well, I was with her; later in the evening she and I had a delightful rabbit together in the home—that was my real Thanksgiving.
GFB: As you look back on the situation as it existed then for women, for females, what are your attitudes, say, toward the women's movement today?
FA: The women's movement as far as I'm concerned is a dead subject. It doesn't mean a blooming thing to me. The ERA, the NOW folks and so forth... I have worked with a few of the activities of the National Council of Negro Women, which Mary McLeod Bethune organized, and my general attitude toward the so-called "pure" black organizations is that I am on the side of the combined approach in women's activities and/or among the sexes. I mean men and women in terms of combined effort can get more things for each other than they can do in separate things. But it doesn't hold that you're going to be really on the know and on the inside workings of organizational efforts, particularly so for the colored.
My concern for various combinations of groups, based on race or sex, is probably best illustrated by a rather recent happening. An organization of black social workers asked me to permit it to set up a scholarship in my name, i.e., the Frankie V. Adams Scholarship Fund. I told the person contacting me I could not afford to accept it, for all my work life I have worked for the opening of opportunities in both white and black organizations to people regardless of color. Yes, more emphasis in the National Association of Social Workers to the complete—insofar as possible— use of competent black persons in funds, positions, and participation has been my operational approach for over fifty years.
GFB: Well, then, I was wondering, are you still active in various organizations and things today that relate to the National Council of Negro Women, or social work?
FA: No, I am not now, at age seventy-five, regularly active with any kind of so-called movement. I am a member of the National Association of Social Workers; I'm a gold star member, and I attend their meetings from time to time. I maintain membership in the Urban League, the Georgia Conference on Social Work, the YWCA, and a few, at least one social club, but I do not find it necessary to be engaged in major volunteer efforts. Presently, from time to time, I am requested by the School of Social Work at Athens to come to meetings of the advisory committee. Work activity—since my full involvement ended in 1967-- has included some social services and training activities with Head Start, as a part of 0E0.	As the director of per-
sonnel, I was developing short term training activities with local agencies.
GFB: What do you consider to be your most important achievement today?
FA: It's very difficult to separate achievement from the work experience.
Actually, one has to expect the accomplishments of students, it seems to me, to get at any kind of answer to one's achievement. The graduates of﻿8
FA: (cont.) the School of Social Work number about two thousand for the period
that I was connected with the teaching side. And one has to think that what these graduates were doing... there are any numbers of persons who tell me from time to time that I helped them to get a sound understanding of working with people on a community basis. I suspect that this would be my major accomplishment in the field of social work, i.e., developing leadership within students. On the other hand, there is another phase of contribution, which I believe is connected with the attitude which I took to certain agencies. The attitude that I pursued was to have a society in which all people were considered as people and not considered on the basis of color and race and previous conditions of servitude. The YWCA, for example, was one of my main organizations through which I worked, the National Conference of Social Workers...
[rest of tape incomprehensible]
GFB: The last time we met we talked about your family and educational background, Miss Adams, and I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about your professional career today. Once you graduated from the Columbia School of Social Work in 1927, where did you go?
FA: Let me correct that. I graduated from the New York School of Social Work,
a two-year course, which was a diploma course at the Russell Sage Foundation, in 1927. And the degree, which was a master's degree in education, was received from the New York University in 1937. So I'm really not a graduate of the Columbia University School of Social Work in this extent, although I am now considered a member of the alumni of Columbia University since the affiliation of the New York School. Special studies in community organization were pursued in 1954 at the University of Michigan. Subsequently I took what you call an undirected study course, which was a research of neighborhood centers. That activity took me to Detroit, Michigan, for approximately three weeks to work with agencies, the University of Michigan, the University of Pittsburgh, and considerable agency work in New York and Washington. This was what I call undirected study; I made the selection of cases to study and the people, in light of what I knew from my own research and reading.
The selection of opportunities to study after I came to the School of Social Work in 1931 was greatly handicapped by the small amounts of money available for time off. Although I did take a period of time off in 1951, and did some travel study, and wrote a research paper on the content of community organizations for selected cities of the South. Those cities included Greenville, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami—that one was done primarily to sneak a trip over to Havana, Cuba. Subsequently, a lengthy study was done in Richmond, Virginia, and in Washington, D.C. There is a document in the Atlanta University Library, I believe still, on the conclusions. This was done primarily to improve my own teaching at the Atlanta University School of Social Work in community organization.
During the summer of 1926, my opportunity for being employed came as a part-time study opportunity, under the supervision of the New York School of Social Work and the women's organization of the Methodist church. This work assignment was a day care director of a migrant camp in Hurlock, Maryland. Now a migrant camp on the east coast at that period of time was﻿9
FA: (cont.) made frequently of 100 to 200 of what were called heads of families. These heads could be women or men; most of them had children in the family, and my responsibility was to direct this day care center for the kids of families who were employed in a tomato or oyster enterprise. And I had two people under me as assistants; one was supposed to be trained in home economics, and the other one was supposed to be a nurse. Neither was outstandingly efficient at the time; consequently the director's job was not only as total planner and supervisor, but also to arrange about cooking and other activities. Now the entire population of Hurlock, Maryland, was probably not more than six or seven hundred people. These people in the camp stayed near the factories and they traveled, as had been described in other literature, from one work camp to the other up and down the east coast, Virginia border, and ending in New Jersey. This was a combination field work and paid employment kind of job.
Now the next job I had was as industrial secretary in the Chicago YWCA from 1927 to March 1931. This work was a characteristic type of work performed during that period by YWCA personnel, working with people who were employed. Our chief concerns were to get shorter hours for industrial girls, get something of an adequate wage, to provide group experience and social activities. In Chicago then at that period, I think I was fortunate in the fact that I had two individuals as supervisors who had some of the same ideas as I had in terms of interracial cooperation. Annetta Dieckman, now deceased, was one of them; and Anne Guthrie of the Chicago YWCA as the executive is now, at least, not available for verification of any of this material, because of age. Nevertheless, these two women as leaders in the YWCA did try to perform activities in such a way that all girls regardless of race or color had as much opportunity as they could have in the YWCA. Now it might be worthwhile to say at this point that the Chicago YWCA with its several branches did have some problems about the use of the various facilities by Negro girls—I mean black girls. I recall an experience where one or two of our branches found it impossible to permit black children to swim in the swimming pool. But one of my colleagues, when asked about the color of the children in her swimming pool by a board member, said, "Well, a friend of mine who is black says that they neither fade nor run." This individual, white, was Gertrude Wilson of the Chicago YWCA—who was somehow released from the Y at that time.
One of the outstanding jobs which my industrial club did was to assist in the desegregation of five central stores on the South Side of Chicago. One of these was Woolworth's on 47th Street, because there were portions of the period which were characteristic of the old Chicago quip: "Do not spend your money where you cannot work." This picketing activity persisted for approximately six months, and then the Woolworth's in the far South Side of Chicago opened up their employment opportunities to Negroes.
In 1931 I left Chicago at the request of Forrester B. Washington to become head of the teaching of community organizations in the Atlanta School of Social Work—it was not a university at that time. The school was located as a separate unit on Auburn Avenue on the top floor of what was then considered a hotel for Negroes. Four rooms comprised the school; Forrester Washington was the director. His private secretary was Madeline White, the sister of Mr. Walter White who was with the National Association for the﻿10
FA: (cont.) Advancement of Colored People. Ernestine McGill, a white woman,
headed up the casework department, and I had been employed to fill a position which Mrs. Sadie J. Mays, wife of Benjamin Mays, had occupied until I arrived, in which she was responsible for teaching casework and developing casework agencies.
Atlanta was solidly segregated in terms of eating places, streetcar transportation, and to some degree the opportunities to try on certain pieces of clothing in the various department stores.
The school did not have any courses in group work. Group work was beginning to become a part of the training for adequate social work activities. Subsequently, one of my first assignments was to develop a teaching sequence in social group work. This was accomplished in connection with my personal cooperation with the group work section of the American Association of Schools of Social Work, and also the National Conference of Social Work. It is well to note, perhaps, that community organization remained a strong course in the school throughout the period of my teaching, i.e., thirty-three years, but from time to time, it received slightly less support in terms of student recruitment. National community organization was not accepted until approximately 1952, as a part of the training sequence methodology for social work. Administration, however, was regarded as a related course in terms of any one of the then considered methods of social work. Nevertheless, the School of Social Work did introduce a separate course in administration, which it was my job to develop and teach. This, I think, occurred about 1955.
During the two or three years that the school was located on Auburn Avenue, it had its own offices under the complete authority of Forrester B. Washington as director. This included developing a catalogue, developing and improving its own student body, and finding jobs for graduates. There was a change which called for schools of social work to become affiliated with the nearest university. Subsequently the Atlanta School of Social Work moved from Auburn Avenue, probably it was the end of '32 or 133, to the campus of Atlanta University, and was housed in a separate building on the campus. Its director remained Forrester B. Washington, and he carried the same responsibilities primarily, except that certain resources of the university became available to the students. John Hope was president when the school moved to the campus, but his tenure was not known after the school had moved enough to get the school totally affiliated as part of the university system. Too, it must be remembered that Forrester Washington wished to be a director rather than a dean of the School of Social Work, and such he remained throughout his entire tenure at the school, which terminated in 1954 before his retirement age.
The School of Social Work shared in several kinds of affiliated activities with the university, particularly in meetings, faculty services and library. As I recall, it was in 1947 that the school gave up its status as a separate school and became a part of the Atlanta University. Prior to that it had remained a School of Social Work that had had its own commencement separate from the university, and had continued to give its diploma until 1939. In 1939 the university opened up the opportunity for social work students﻿11
FA: (cont.) to get the master's degree from the fruits of their two years of work and the writing of a satisfactory thesis. The pleasure of working under Forrester Washington was a very rich experience, although one did, as a faculty member, have to make certain demands on him; he was a fair kind of a man, with broad ideas on race and race relations, that inspired the course of direction for black students; and his writings, which could be found in both libraries, would tend to verify that point of view.
Whitney Young came to the school at the termination of Forrester Washington's period of service. Young was interested in social action, and for the most part maintained the same tradition that the school had during the Washington regime. However, he did encourage a great deal more research and study, and together, the participation of the faculty members with him. And community activities seemed to take on more emphasis in the program. Whitney Young had been a director of the Urban League in Minnesota, and some of the community action type of work that he had done formerly in Minnesota came into his practice in the teaching and participating at the School of Social Work. He broadened the base of recruitment for students. In 1954 the famous school desegregation act was passed, and this step made it possible for Whitney Young to do recruiting of white students. It must be noted, however, that the School of Social Work had had at least three white students prior to Whitney Young's coming, but without the knowledge of the general Atlanta community that the white students were taking special and separate courses at the school. This could not be publicized, because if it had been, the school would have lost its so-called financial base as far as the state of Georgia was concerned.
During my tenure of thirty-three years at the Atlanta University School of Social Work, a period of approximately one year was given to consulting work with the national board of the YWCA, developing community services on the west coast of the United States. This idea transpired in 1944-1945, and it included the efforts to open up social work agencies and housing for the migration of Negro people from southern communities as workers. The consulting work took place in Phoenix, Arizona; Pasadena, California; San Francisco; Colorado Springs; and Long Beach, California—did I mention L.A.?—Los Angeles. The contacts were primarily to be made through the YWCA. The YWCAs in these various communities were unaccustomed to having Negroes take part in their general activities. Phoenix, Arizona, for example, had a special housing facility within the YWCA district set aside for meeting needs as an individual, for sleeping and eating was out of the general community. The first contact in San Francisco was at a hotel where the national board tour person had engaged a room for me without saying that I was one color or the other, and this was the Saint Francis Hotel. On arrival I was told that the room was taken. I insisted that it wasn't and had my bags taken to it. The room was not quite the room that I would have picked on my own, but I did stay in the hotel. Note that this was in the period of 1944. The next part of my activity occurred in Pasadena, California, where it was quite obvious that every person was bending over backward to see to it that I had a beautiful time in the facility. However, it was awful obvious that having black people in this place was a new experience. One had to work through that, without calling too much attention to it but nevertheless getting the necessary credit for one's color.﻿12
(cont.) Throughout the West at the time, as far as migrant Negroes were concerned, or Negroes in general, there were very close lines as to where Negroes could work, what they could work at, where they could do it and where they could eat. Certain times throughout the communities, signs were posted in eating places saying, "We reserve the right to refuse service to undesirables," and underlined undesirables. Undesirables were people of any color, and at that time, Japanese and Spanish-speaking individuals from Mexico, as well as Negroes. This job took me frequently to New York City, where I would turn in reports from time to time.
One report which was preserved through the national board of the YWCA was that in a Colorado town in attendance at the Y teen meetings, one of the first ones, some thirty-five or forty individuals, teenagers, were asked as to what kind of work they wanted to do when they were finished with their high school work, and the response was as a soda jerker. One little girl only was aware that I, as a teacher, was something different, and wanted to know what my job was. And I explained it, and then she said, "Well, I want to be one of you." This was the first time that these little teenaged girls had heard of the possibility of Negro children doing other kind of work than the pitiful, menial type of work. In Denver, Colorado, I was called to speak for a white friend of mine at the University of Denver. In her class were four Negro girls who didn't get the idea that I, too, was going to be a Negro, but then I arrived to speak and they held their heads down against their hands. I suppose they felt that they were going to be embarrassed. I immediately said to myself, "I'm going to make them raise their heads up," and so I spoke on group work and I did; some of them raised them up, in evidence of pride.
It was one of the attitudes that segregation, discrimination encouraged in the West, not to the same degree as in the South, but it was the kind of segregation and discrimination which left one constantly questioning what was going to happen next, while in the South one knew at first where to go, and so it was really easier. During the whole course of my tenure at the Atlanta University School of Social Work, where travel was concerned, it was easier to find the kind of accommodation without mishap in the South than it was in many of the northern or the western cities where we had field work students placed and working regularly.
Now in connection with the Atlanta School of Social Work, my final activity was that after being, for a period of slightly over a year, in that capacity, one did miss a regular job of supervising a staff of approximately fourteen people...
After leaving the School of Social Work I had definitely decided that I wasn't going to work anywhere else, but it didn't turn out that way, quite. For almost within a period of six months, I found myself in a full-time job with the Atlanta Economic Opportunity program, which was a part of 0E0. My first job there was as director of aide training and staff development, and in that connection, in cooperation with the Community Council of Social Work, a course and program training activity was developed and funded by the federal 0E0. It was John Calhoun who was my colleague in conducting that program, and a Mrs. Martha Ryan, white, was my co-worker in the training﻿13
(cont.) program. And she lived long, and remains a very good friend of mine in Atlanta. She is not a social worker; she was trained as a teacher, and for that reason she was particularly useful. And the poverty program of the early EOA was to see to it that discrimination did not persist in the organization. My aide and staff training program was supposed to continue for a period of two full years, but it got interrupted and I was pushed into directorship of the neighborhood service unit here in Atlanta, and helped to develop the centers—from four up to twelve within the period of the time of less than a year and a half. Just prior to my leaving the agency in 1967, I was made associate administrator of the entire agency, which I considered certainly too close for me at my age, and immediately took with the idea of getting out of the agency.
The neighborhood service centers were developed with a director from certain sections of the city. These were areas including poor people, black and white, of twenty to thirty thousand people. The people in those areas were to be given casework services, -jobs where they could be found, counseling activities. These were poverty areas of Atlanta, and the centers were focused primarily at easing the problems of poverty, including health, housing, jobs and training. And as I said above, there were twelve of them under my supervision. There were twelve directors and it became my job to develop some training activity for the directors, for they were not all trained in social work, and for the social work staff people as well as the aides. These were the problems that 0E0 nationally had been developed to deal with, within the population areas throughout the country. Our project was considered one of the best 0E0 offices in the country, and it still is in existence, although its focus has changed as the times have changed. The entire ramifications of poverty were dealt with as indicated above, including unmarried mothers, low attainment in school levels, and problems of rat infestation of some areas, and the matter of some intensive casework that's not enough to deal with major problems such as the family service organizations dealt with.
During 1965-66, I was given the opportunity to teach in the beginning School of Social Work at the University of Georgia at Athens. I was the first and only black employee during the initial stages of that school, and helped the school by my presence to get its accreditation with the National Council on Social Work Education.

I am continuing the interview with Professor Adams at her home at 172 Racine Street. Today is May 11, 1977.
The parents' attitude toward the daughters attending school was largely due to the fact that being left at home as a girl, there was better protection for me as a girl to continue in school. Consequently that was the reason for picking out Knoxville College, which had been attended by a sister of ours, earlier, when she was preparing to do some teaching in rural schools; she completed what would be classified now as high school, and at the time I attended the school, she was teaching in the rural sections around Danville, Kentucky.

The idea of being black and female did not seem to have too great significance. It is well, probably, to recall that Knoxville College is a United Presbyterian Church school. The teachers, largely white with one exception, as I recall, did not make significant comments or teachings around the idea of what kind of jobs individuals took. I think the period, however, did look upon this separation of jobs as is still characteristic in our society today, namely that women went into teaching, domestic science, the various homemaking kinds of jobs, but I do not recall that any of this particularly had bearing on my own choice.
Now I am rather sure that the church and religion played an important part in my development. For as long as I can remember, my parents took me to church, and I taught Sunday school as soon as I was able to read some portions of the lesson,in quotation lessons. The general philosophy of church teaching has been revised to the point of my social work interest. I do not find it important to argue about what is in the Bible or what is not in the Bible that is considered true or false. Religion to me, as I continue to teach in the Sunday school setting, is important in light of what influence it may have on individuals' behavior.
I have served on a number of boards of directors, both locally and nationally. Some of these included the national board of the YWCA, the Council on Social Work Education as its secretary, the Atlanta Tuberculosis Association, the Gate City Day Nursery Association, the local YWCA, and the Urban League. I was on the National Conference of Social Welfare for a period of three years, and I also have served as a part of the professional organization of NASW. That organization was organized in 1955, and I became the first black secretary of the organization. Since that time the organization has extended its officership to any number of people, and it has also honored me with a special citation known as the Frankie V. Adams Award. There are several other awards: an accolade from the Georgia Conference of Social Welfare; two citations from Atlanta University School of Social Work; a hand-painted photograph hangs in the Atlanta University School building here in Atlanta—this was given by the alumni association; an Equal Opportunity Award from the National Urban League; and the Iota Phi Lambda Sorority of Atlanta honored me on two or three occasions as the "Bronze Woman in Education" and as an outstanding social worker of the year. Just recently the local Urban League honored me with the Jesse 0. Thomas Award; Jesse 0. Thomas was an outstanding founder in the Atlanta University School of Social Work and an activist in the organization of the Urban League in this region for a number of years.
I had maintained memberships in a number of organizations, but rarely in any per se city organizations. Most of the organizations that I have membership in now or formerly have been organizations related to social work as such. I belong to one social club known as the Utopian Literary Club. Its primary function is to improve its own membership in terms of the current literature and also current topics of the day. This is still in existence even though it is now sixty-one years of age, and still carries on the same type of program. It is not a social action group in the strictest sense.﻿15
FA: (cont.) During the civil rights activities of students in the early sixties, I gave financial support, but did not give membership or participatory support in terms of marching activities. At the time I was teaching at Atlanta University, and my primary concern was to get ideas before the young people, but not to take part in the sit-ins and that type of activity. My approach to the solution of problems over the years has been on the conference approach and incentive approach rather than the "marching" approach.
At the present time I would not consider myself as having any striking hobbies. When I was in college I did play tennis regularly, and I did play whist as a hobby, but one might consider the sketches on race and race relations or the little poems which X have written for one reason or the other as a kind of hobby. Probably the nearest thing that I now pursue as a hobby is maintaining a file of birthdays, which I remember with cards or messages on a monthly basis, to friends, family, and members of a Sunday school class.
Travel as such has been limited to the United States and islands in the Caribbean. The short trip into Canada several times probably was the nearest thing to a quasi-foreign experience. The travel for me over the United States has been wide, due to the kind of field work placement which the Atlanta University School of Social Work employed, in that students were placed throughout the country beginning in 1941. And part of my job entailed my visiting these students at least twice a year, or twice on the field work assignment period, and this took me to a great many places. One job with the national board of the YWCA during World War II called for extensive travel on the west coast. This involved helping to integrate newcomers, both white and black, into the general opportunities to use the service, to get housing and to get jobs in some selected communities on the west coast.
It may be of interest to know that on one occasion a speaker at the Utopian Club criticized the idea that unmarried mothers were in attendance as teenagers in one of the local high schools. The entire club was very much against the idea of such children being in the school with nonpregnant children, and I was one of the people who made the comment that they had a right to go to school, and that it would be to their advantage to go to school rather than to have their babies and then be unable to do any kind of work. Whereupon I was criticized as, "You see, she's a social worker!"﻿FRANKIE V. ADAMS
