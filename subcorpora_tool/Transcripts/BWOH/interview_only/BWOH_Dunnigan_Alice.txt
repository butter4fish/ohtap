Marcia M. Greenlee:
Alice Allison Dunnigan:
This is an interview with Alice Allison Dunnigan. The interview is taking place in Mrs. Dunnigan's home on the 8th of April, 1977. Her home is at 1462 Odgen Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C. Mrs. Dunnigan, although you retired from government service as a member of the Youth Council in 1970, and from journalism and politics at the same time, you've not stopped studying, learning, and writing. Your 662-page autobiography, A Black Woman's Experience—From Schoolhouse to White House, was published in 1974. Would you please describe your career as it is today? What projects are you at work on?
Today I'm doing research on a history of black Kentuckians. I chose that subject because I am a Kentuckian, I know a lot of people in Kentucky and I know the state better than any other state in the world. I have worked on newspapers in Kentucky and have a great deal of data collected during those newspaper days. After having completed my autobiography, I decided to pull together the information I had on Kentucky, update it, and put it together in a book which I haven't yet named. I'm thinking of calling it something like "Problems, Progress and Pride: Black Kentucky Heritage."
Marcia M. Greenlee:
Do you have any project in mind for after that?
Alice Allison Dunnigan:
No, I think by the time I finish this one, if I ever get it finished and published, I think I'll be ready to retire. Really retire!
Marcia M. Greenlee: Alice Allison Dunnigan: Marcia M. Greenlee:
Really retire?
Yes.
I'd like to discuss with you some of the early influences on your life, and the origins of your career interests. Perhaps we should start with your family background. You were﻿2
MMG: (cont.) born on April 27th, 1906 in Russellville, Kentucky. Your father was Willie Allison and your mother was Lena Pittman Allison. Would you tell me something about your parents and the most important influences you believe they had on you?
AAD: Well, my parents were just common laboring people. My father was a sharecropper, and my mother was a laundress. And of course I came up under very poor circumstances in a rural area, about two miles from the very small village of Russellville, Kentucky. My parents were very industrious. They worked hard all their lives, and they made me work from as far back as I can remember. So if they had any influence at all on my life, one of the things was to keep me busy, and to teach me to work and to make me love working, if there's any such thing as a person loving work.
MMG: You were the youngest of two children. You have a brother, Richard. Will you tell me something about your brother? Did you share any interests?
AAD: No. My brother and I weren't very close. I think that was because of the great difference in our age. My brother was seven years older than I. And of course when I was fourteen, for instance, a teenager, he was a young man of twenty-one. For that reason we didn't have too much in common. Another thing, I was always interested in school, in trying to obtain an education and he, on the other hand, hated school and wanted to go out into the workaday world.
MMG: Is your brother still living?
AAD: Yes, he is.
MMG: Who were some of your other relatives who were particularly important in your life? In what ways did they influence you?
AAD: Well, my relatives were just ordinary people, so I don't know if they had a great deal of influence on my life, other than to try to bring me up in what they considered the proper way. I would call it the "straight and narrow" because of their strict discipline. Other than that, we were just a normal family.
MMG: What are some of your earliest childhood memories?
AAD: One of the things I remember best is what I just mentioned about my
interest in education. I always wanted to go to school, even when I was only three or four years old. When my big brother would go to school, leaving me at home, I would always cry. I wanted to go to school with him. And of course I couldn't go, because we had a distance of about two miles one way, four miles a day, and naturally I was too small to take that long journey. But my teacher, the primary teacher in the school which my brother attended, told my mother on one occasion that when I reached the age of four, if she would buy me what they called in those days a penny pencil and a tablet, and let me come to school whenever she felt that I should come, she would teach me to read. That was a great day in my life. My mother would let me go to school about every Friday. 1 was taught along﻿3
AAD: (cont.) with the regular primary class. At the age of six, when I was entering school officially, I was ready for the first grade, which made me one grade ahead of the other children my age.
MMG: Was that Miss McCarley that you speak of in your autobiography?
AAD: Yes, yes. Her name was Mattie McCarley.
MMG: Mattie McCarley. What events stand out in your mind from your youth and your young adulthood?
AAD: Well, let's go back a little bit into my childhood.
MMG: All right.
AAD: After I became regular school age, I attended school almost every day.
Living a long distance from school, my mother would not let me go out on a rainy or snowy day. When I had to stay home, I cried all day. If it stopped rairing about ten o'clock in the morning, she would let me go to school if I could get there by noon, in time for afternoon classes. The children who lived in town had a grudge against me. As we said in those days, "they picked on me." Because for one thing, I was a country girl, and another thing, I was more interested in school. They wouldn't come to school if it was raining or snowing, although they lived nearby, while on the other hand, I would make this long journey to come to school. So the kids would call me all kinds of names like "stupid country bumpkin." I had a big nose as you can see, so the kids used to line up and run past me and hit me on the nose and call me "rubber nose." And I would cry about that, not knowing how to take up for myself. So those incidents stand out in my mind. But anyway, I kept on in school until I finished.
Now the other question was about young adulthood and my adolescent age. I just mentioned how strict my parents were cm me. When other teenagers were looking at members of the opposite sex, I was denied the opportunity to go around with young men. My parents never allowed me to go out with boyfriends, because they were afraid I would get in trouble, as they said. So that was something that bothered me all of my young life, because when other girls were going out to parties and other affairs with their own little boyfriends, I would always have to go with my brother, or go alone, or stay at home.
Another situation...living a long distance from school as I did, I was always looking for a boyfriend who had transportation. As the youngsters say today, I was looking for someone with wheels- I was looking for someone who could give me a lift home from school in the afternoons. Finally I became friendly with a young man who drove a grocery truck. He would pick me up after school and give me a lift home. He could never carry me all the way to my house. He had to put me out before Teaching the house, because my parents would not be very happy if they saw me getting out of the truck with some young man. So as time went on, somebody told my parents about this young man bringing me home, and it created quite a stir in our family. I soon became acquainted with another young man who was a chauffeur for a﻿4
AAD: (cont.) doctor. Sometimes he would bring me home from school, dropping me off out of sight of the house. My parents heard about that from nosy neighbors and broke it up.
MMG: Who were these people telling tales?
AAD: They were the neighbors who lived near the road side. They were all
white. And they had nothing better to do than sit out on the front porch and gaze at passersby, just watching everybody going up and down the road. This being a small community, everybody knew everybody. If they saw something they didn't approve of, they'd tell everybody about it. In that way they kept something going between neighbors or individual families all of the time. Because my mother always listened to their gossip and tried hard to please everybody, she denied me the opportunity of going out with young men and living a normal life as other girls did.
MMG: Let's talk a little about your formal education. You've already spoken of Miss McCarley who gave you a kind of private kindergarten before you entered the first grade. You attended the elementary school for black children in Russellville, and then you went on to graduate from the Knob City High School. How would you characterize your early education?
AAD: Now in cities or towns of that size, they only had one school. So it was
not broken down into elementary, junior high, et cetera. It was just one school, that started from the primary and went through the tenth grade. We didn't have a four-year high school at that time. We only had a two-year high school, so I kept in school until I finished those two years.
I wanted to continue my education. I wanted to go away to school, perhaps for more than one reason. I was very unhappy at home because of my lack of social activities, and because I wanted to better myself. I wanted to teach school. And I said "teach," because that was the only thing that black women could do in the South in those days, was to teach school. So I wanted to finish school, so I'd be prepared to do something other than what my parents had been doing all of their lives.
But my parents were not pleased with my wanting to go to school. I guess they were pleased with my ambition, but my father took the position, well, both parents took the position that they were not able to send me to school because they didn't make much money. My father, being a sharecropper, received no money until the end of the year when the tobacco crop was sold. So my mother had to do laundry work throughout the year to keep the family going, but she didn't make more than five dollars a week. She'd have to do about three families of washings before she could make that, because families paid one dollar or two dollars or something like that for a week's laundry. So with the small amount of money she earned, she knew she couldn't keep me in school. That bothered her some, I think, but she took it like a lamb. Well, my father just outright protested. He kept asking, "Why does Alice want to be a teacher? None of my folks were ever teachers. Why would she want to be a teacher?" He never did anything to try to help, or to encourage me.﻿5
AAD: (cont.) As time went on and schooltime drew near, I cried and I prayed, and I did everything. I wrote every school—I say every school, because there were only two black colleges in the state. And I wrote them to see if I could get a job to help pay my expenses. My requests were denied. Both schools said they had no jobs. Jobs were all taken. And at that time, they wouldn't allow a girl student to work off campus, so that eliminated many opportunities due to sex.
When it was almost time for school to begin, I had gotten to the place that I couldn't eat, I wouldn't talk, I was running a temperature. So my mother sent me away to visit a friend in a nearby little town, to get my mind off of school. I was to stay over the weekend with this friend. But on Sunday my mother and father came down (in those days they were using buggies), came down in a buggy to pick me up and carry me home. Of course I was very unhappy about this, because I had made up my mind to stay over the weekend. Mv parents just told me to come on and go home, saying, "You have to be there tomorrow because we're going to send you to school." That was quite a surprise for me, a very pleasant surprise, I must say.
When I got home, I discovered that three students of my graduating class were prepared to go to Frankfort. That's where the Kentucky State College is located. They were prepared to leave the next morning, Monday morning. But after my parents said I could go, my classmates stayed until Monday night to give me a chance to get myself together. I pulled one or two little pieces of clothing together in an old trunk which I borrowed from an aunt, and that night we were ready to go to school. I mean, I was ready to join them on their trip to Frankfort.
MMG: Did you feel that your education in Russellville was adequate preparation
for what you encountered once you were at Kentucky State? Was it comparable?
AAD: Yes. It was adequate in that all the black state schools were about the same. But there were things that just didn't conform, like we were graduates of a two-year high school rather than a four-year high school, but that was permissible in those days. Might I stop here to say why my mother and father changed their mind?
MMG: Yes.
AAD: About sending me to school? I was very active in church work. I was a Sunday School secretary for a long time, my mother knew this. And the Sunday School superintendent was a dentist, the only black dentist in my home town. As other students were getting ready to go to school, he asked me one Sunday morning where was I going to school? And I told him I wasn't going at all. He couldn't understand why I would not be going to school, because, he said, "You were valedictorian of your class, and had further to walk to school than anybody else. Why would you work so hard and make such sacrifices to finish school, and study so hard to become valedictorian, and just stop your education here?" I told him I was not going because my parents were not able to send me. So he told me that he wanted to talk with my parents.﻿6
AAD: (cont.) He never had a chance to talk to them until that Sunday
morning when I was visiting my friend. They went to church that morning, and the dentist, Dr. William Russell, had a talk with them. He told them that he thought they were depriving me of a future by not making any attempt to send me to school. They told him the same story that they were not able to send me to school. And he said, "Well, you try to send her anyway because I know, I believe, she'll make good. Do the best you can for her, and if you get to the place where you can't do any more, call on me, and I will lend her the money. I will not look to you to pay it back. I will look to her to repay it. I have enough faith in her to believe that she will finish school, and she will do well, and she will repay me." That gave them some encouragement. As a matter of fact, they couldn't get out of it, because he had really put it on the line. So anyway, that was how the situation changed.
Sow, I did go to school as I said. When we got to school that afternoon, of course everything was strange. None of us had ever been outside of Russellville before, so it was quite a new experience. I was sitting in the reception room in the girls' dormitory, just looking out the window that afternoon and feeling awfully blue, when a lady came to me and asked if I would help her in the dining room, and of course I went along. Well, she happened to be the stewardess in charge of food service. And she asked me if I would help set the tables up in the dining room, and serve the supper, as they called it in those days. I went along very willingly. When I finished, I asked if I could have a regular job working in the dining room. She said no, because the jobs were all taken. They'd been filled from the year before, I believe. Some of the girls just hadn't arrived yet. I went out feeling a little disappointed.
The next morning, really early in the morning, somebody was paging me in the hall of the girls' dormitory. "Mrs. Harrison wants to see you," the pager said. Mrs. Harrison was the same lady, the stewardess. When I went downstairs, she asked if I would help her serve breakfast. After breakfast, she told me that she would give me the job. Although the jobs had been promised to other girls last year, if they were interested in the job, they should have been on time. Since they weren't I could have the job of waiting tables and washing dishes. That's the way I got through school the first year. They didn't pay any money for that work, they only gave a reduction on the student's board. They got half-board deducted from the regular board bill. Board at that time was $15 a month. Which meant that I did this whole month's work for a $7.50 deduction. But at that rate my parents only had to send $7.50 for my board each month. They really sent $10 and that gave me $2.50 for spending for the whole month. That's the way I got through school for one year.
MMG: yes. Well, you were one year at Kentucky State, and then you received a teaching certificate. Could you explain a little how certificates were awarded and what they enabled you to do and the rest?
AAD: In those days, most black schools were normal schools. They were not
colleges. They started with a four-year high school and a two-year college.﻿7
AAD: (cont.) Students who had finished the eighth grade, and attended normal school for two years, taking a special teachers training course, would receive a two-year teachers certificate, permitting them to teach in any elementary school in the state. Students who had completed a two-year high school, as I had, could enroll in the intermediate teachers training course for two years of study and would be eligible to receive a four-year teachers certificate, which qualified them to teach in the elementary and junior high schools across the state. High school graduates, who attended the normal school for two years, would graduate with a diploma and a lifetime teachers certificate, qualifying them to teach in any elementary, junior high or senior high school in the state.
In my case, I enrolled in the intermediate teachers training course, which would have prepared me for a four-year certificate, had I been able to stay two years. But I wasn't able because my health gave out before the
end of the first year. I wasn't well. I wasn't able to continue working. And I knew my parents had made sacrifices for me, so at the end of the first year, I discovered that I couldn't return the next year, because of those two factors.
It occurred to me that maybe if I would talk to the dean, he would give me a two-year elementary teaching certificate, because I had already done a year's work over the required qualifications for that type of certificate. After discussing it with the dean, he presented the proposal to a faculty committee. The committee decided that if my grades were satisfactory, they would consider it. The grades hadn't been sent out at the time. The dean wrote a note and sent it by me to each of my instructors. The sealed letter was an inquiry regarding my grades. Each teacher listed my final grade in a sealed envelope which I delivered back to the dean. I was scared to death, because I didn't know whether I made it or not. My grades proved to be very good. I think the lowest was about 85, and they ran on up to about 93. The committee thought that it was great for me to have made that type of record, having worked as hard as I did as a dishwasher and waitress. They were so impressed with this record that they agreed to issue me a two-year teachers certificate, which gave me a chance to teach for awhile to earn some money to return to school.
I returned for further study during the spring and summer terms. Rural schools had only seven-month terms. At the end of seven months, the rural teacher could go back to school for five months, which was equivalent to one semester. By going back in the spring and summer terms, one could continue the educational progress-
MMG: You also attended, this was later on, West Kentucky Industrial College.
What are your memories from your education there? What sort of experience was it?
AAD: Well, I went back to Kentucky State College, let's get to that, after
that one year. I went back springs and summers from 1924 until the summer of 1926, when I completed my intermediate training course and received my four-year teaching certificate.﻿8
AAD: (cont.) Then I taught four years, after which I decided to go to West Kentucky Industrial College, which was a relatively new college. It wasn't exactly a new college, but it had just recently been accredited. I went down to the school in the summer and asked for a job. I was promised a job as cook. I went back in the fall for a full year, working as second cook. That school had the same arrangement as Kentucky State, only it allowed full board for the job. So I stayed there one year, hoping to graduate at the end of that year of 1931. At the end of the term, when they started adding up my credits, picked up from different schools, and through correspondence courses, they found that I lacked eight college hours of having a sufficient number of credits to graduate. But I was awarded a teachers certificate at the end of the term. This was just a two-year certificate, but I could teach until I went back to school and earned my additional eight hours. The next spring I returned to West Kentucky, and made up the extra eight hours and graduated with the class of 1932.
I was very disappointed because I didn't graduate in the class of '31. One reason I was so disappointed was that we were having a congressman as our commencement speaker.. He was Congressman Oscar DePriest, the first black man in Congress since Reconstruction. People in the Kentucky area, including myself, had never seen a Congressman, to say nothing of seeing a black Congressman. And oh, I wanted so much to parade across the platform and receive my certificate. But anyway, I was sitting in the back of the room during the commencement exercises, brooding, and I guess feeling sorry for myself, when all of a sudden I heard my name being called. It came after everybody else in the class had received their certificates. I felt so proud to walk from the back row of the auditorium, all the way up front. I felt as important as a movie star going up for her Oscar.
So anyway, they spotlighted me all the way from my back seat to the dais up front. When I got there, surprisingly enough, they gave me a certificate in home economics, because, in addition to my regular work load, I had taken every course in home economics that the school offered. Being a new school, they had just opened up a home economics department, and I had taken advantage of every course. I was very proud of myself, because I received more attention from the Congressman and from the general audience than the regular graduates. That was the first home economics certificate that the school had ever given. I was very proud of it. It now has great historic value. It was important even at the time it was awarded, because it qualified me to teach home economics in the high schools. That certificate hangs on my kitchen wall today.
^MG: As an inspiration?
Yes. In the cooking class there were only two students. I went to the dean at the beginning of the term and asked for a course in cooking. The school hadn't even organized one, but it had all the necessary equipment. The state had equipped the kitchen with proper utensils, but the school had not employed a home ec. teacher. The dean admitted that there was a home economics teacher on the faculty, but she was teaching other subjects. He could assign her to the cooking department, but there was no money available﻿9
AAD: (cont.) for food for practice work. My roommate and I, the only two
cooking students, agreed to buy our own food for practice, providing we were allowed to eat what we cooked. We had fun in that class, because we bought only what we liked, and ate what we bought, with no thought of balanced meals, nutrition or even vitamins. Needless to say that we were not interested in learning to prepare unusual dishes or fancy foods, we were only interested in cooking what we liked. And we just happened to like banana pie, and that is all we learned to cook. We had banana pie almost every day. We would cut it in quarters; the two students and the teacher would have their share, and the fourth quarter would always be carried to the school president for his lunch.
MMG: How were you received by your professors and your fellow students at these two schools?
AAD: At Kentucky State, it vas a little difficult. It was almost like being an outcast country girl in Russellville. Kentucky State was a school of snobs. That is, children of professionals. If you happened to be a son or daughter of a doctor or teacher or any professional, you got much more recognition than if you were just a child of an ordinary family. If you were a working student, you got still less consideration. So I had a pretty tough go there. Working students couldn't attend any social functions, because there was no time, for one thing. You were kept busy all of the time. When you weren't working, you had to spend every leisure minute studying. If the sororities and fraternities or any other social club gave any swank affairs, you couldn't attend because you were not a member. And you were not a member because you had no money to belong.
But West Kentucky College was a beautiful school. The atmosphere was pleasant; it was a pleasure working there. The college was built to provide opportunities for poor students. Everybody there had a job; we were all working students. Therefore, we were all on the same social level, and that made for a pleasant environment. I enjoyed working and studying and socializing there very much. There were no big "I's" and little "you's."
MMG: You mentioned earlier that your parents were not particularly supportive
toward your education early on. Was there any particular opinion expressed in the community about educating women in general, and you in particular?
AAD: No, I think not, because any woman who graduated from high school and was able to go to college always went. And I think people expected you to do that. And if you went to college, as I said earlier, there wasn't anything else you could do in the South, if you were a black woman, other than to teach. People of the South didn't bother too much about educating the boys in those days. The emphasis was on boys quitting school early and going to work.
MMG: Has there been an important influence played by any nonrelated persons in your life, and in your later career interests? You talked about the doctor that spoke to your parents before you went away to college. Was there anyone else that was really significant?﻿10
AAD: My Sunday School teacher was. As a young child, I admired her greatly.
She was really my brother's teacher in day school, but in Sunday School she was what we called the card class teacher, that was the class of very young children. I think there was a reason, or maybe two reasons, why I was so interested in her. For one thing, she was a very kind person, very understanding and very affectionate. She was a stout lady, light complexioned with long black hair, but still she was very friendly.
And I remember that one of my problems at school as a little girl (besides the "rubber nose" incident) was the slurs made about my complexion. I was kind of light complected, and the darker children would pick on me, calling me "little old half-white nigger," and other different kinds of names. My mother used to plait my hair, and tie bows of ribbon on my long braids like children were wearing in those days- The children would make slight remarks about my pigtails, jerk my braids, snatch off my hair ribbon and throw it away. This always gave me a feeling of inferiority. I used to think I was different from other children because my hair was long, my color light and my body chubby. But when I looked at this teacher (Arietta Vaughn was her name), I think she inspired me. I was a fat little girl, too. So I'd say to myself that I'm going to be just like Miss Arietta when I grow up. I'll be a big fat yellow woman (as people said in those days), and I'll have long hair, and the children and other people will not laugh at my hair, my color and my size. And furthermore I'll have the same disposition as she has. I'm going to be kind to other people and try to help them.
And then came the idea that I'm going to write. I'm going to write articles in the newspapers, and let people know what otheT people are doing around the world. So I think she was a great inspiration to me. When I got grown, and even after I came to Washington, I never forgot her. But I never told her how I felt about her. I kind of feel badly about that, because when I used to go home on vacations, I would talk about her to my mother. And she said, "Why don't you tell her? Tell her she was an inspiration when you were a little girl." I never got around to telling her before she died.
MMG: What has been the role of religion in your life? Has it been of any particular importance?
AAD: Well, we were a religious family. I think most people in the South are religious. So I think our only social outlet, my parents' only social outlet anyway, was to go to church. So I regularly attended Sunday School, as I mentioned earlier. All of my life I was a churchgoer, attending morning service, as we called it. Yes, I had great faith in religion. And I believed all the time that these things I mentioned about having a hard time trying to get into school, would work out if I prayed. I was just a child, but I prayed and I believed; I kept believing. It was faith, I guess you'd call it, that something would happen. And always, regardless of how rough the road seemed, at the last minute something would come up, like this business I told you about my going to school. I had that experience in several other instances. So I'm still a believer in religion. I'm not a fanatic, a religious fanatic, but I have faith, and believe that﻿11
AAD: (cont.) some day, somewhere, things will come about, if you work hard enough and pray hard enough.
MMG: You're well versed on national and world affairs. Have there been any
local or national or international events which you think were significant in affecting your life and work?
AAD: I can't think of any events that affected my work, unless you want to call World War II an event. Of course, I had been teaching down in Kentucky all these years, the number being about eighteen in all, I think, and I was very tired of teaching. I love teaching school. I love children. But I have one problem in my teaching experience. I'm a very, very poor disciplinarian. I feel like I'm a good teacher, good instructor, but I had problems with discipline, and of course as time goes on, discipline problems are greater. And I would say, well, I've done everything I can down here for these children. I would like to get out of Russellville. I'd like to go some other place. But you can't just go places without a job.
Then came World War II. Then one day I was in the post office at my little home town, and I saw these placards up on the bulletin board calling for clerk-typists in Washington. I had taken typing in my college career, and I went down to talk to the postmaster about giving the examination. He told me he would give me the examination if I would furnish my own typewriter. Then, poor as we were in the South, I was not used to typewriters, but anyway I had one little portable that I had ordered from a magazine. So I carried my little portable down and took the examination at the post office.
But I didn't pass the typing examination, because the typewriter was skipping spaces and all that. The examination papers had to be sent to the regional office in Cincinnati, Ohio, for grading. When they came back, the postmaster said that I'd made such a good grade on my oral examination that they were willing to give me another chance at the practice work on the typewriter. So I took it a second time, and this time I passed. Then I filled out the regular application for a job in the federal service. The application asked that if there were jobs available in various localities, what places would I be willing to work. I replied by saying that I would go anywhere in the United States. Within a few days, I sent off the application form about Monday, I received a reply on Wednesday telling me to come to Washington. So that's how I happened to get into the federal government in Washington as a clerk-typist. So there, I guess that's one big event that affected my work and changed my life's career.
MMG: Well, so far we've discussed persons and events important in your life
and work. Have there been any places or geographical regions that you think have influenced you and helped shape your career?
AAD: I had never done a great deal of traveling. That is one of the things I always wanted to do in life, was to travel. So of course coming to Washington was a pretty big thing for me. I traveled all over the United﻿12
AAD: (cont.) States after X got to Washington, because of the job assignments I had. But I didn't do any traveling overseas until many years later. I can't say that my travels influenced my life in any way, except to have a greater respect for people all over the world. I did study government in all the countries I visited. I always looked at the racial problems, since that was my greatest interest. I talked to dignitaries in various countries. And I guess that was quite inspirational to me. I did quite a lot of traveling in those days.
And then after I became a newspaper reporter, and especially attached to the State Department, I came in contact with many heads of states from all over the world. Meeting these diplomats was more thrilling than I can ever express. That was quite inspirational.
I think that one of my greatest thrills was to talk with Queen Mother Elizabeth of England. The three black women reporters present felt especially honored when the Queen Mother stepped out of the receiving line to shake hands with us. She seemed curious to know who we were and what our business was. She greeted us somewhat differently than she did the other reporters. She made no special effort to shake hands with the white reporters. Perhaps because there were too many of them. Or maybe because they were just the ordinary type of newsmen that she expected to see. But to see black reporters among the top echelon of the Washington press corps in those days was very unusual. She was anxious to know what we were doing there and who we represented.
I had already met and talked with the younger Queen Elizabeth when she was still a princess, but I think the greatest thrill was talking to the Queen Mother. And of course, in later years, the younger Queen Elizabeth revisited Washington after she became Queen. The press association held another reception for Queen Elizabeth's sister, Princess Margaret, during her visit to Washington. I guess those were some of the greatest thrills I experienced.
-IMG: in 1926, when you were nineteen, is that right, you married Walter Dickinson of Mt. Pisgah, Kentucky. And you were divorced in 1930. A year later, you married Charles Dunnigan, a childhood friend from Russellville. You and Mr. Dunnigan were separated in 1953. could you tell me something about each of these men. How did you meet each other?
I met Walter Dickinson during my first year of school teaching. I had a difficult time getting a job after I finished college, because the supply of teachers at that time was so much greater than the demand. So I had a most difficult time finding a job because I was young, that was the excuse. I was too young and inexperienced. And here's another time when something happened at the last minute. I had gone all through the summer trying to get a job. I had sent applications to every county in the state, and I had visited, in person, superintendents in the adjacent counties to my home.
Well, I didn't have any job. And this is what happened on the day before Labor Day. I was attending a baseball game, had given up the idea of having﻿13
AAD: (cont.) a job. And my brother came out to the baseball park on that day and said, "Come on home." Well, I was very mad with him because I had just relaxed to have a good time when he came for me. Well anyway, I wanted to know why, and he said, "You got to go to your school tomorrow." And I said, "What school?" I thought he was sort of pulling my leg. And he said, "Mama says to come home because she had a telephone call for you to report to a school in Todd County tomorrow morning."
When I got home my mother told me that the superintendent of that county had called. We didn't have a telephone, nobody in the country had telephones in those days. When the superintendent was unable to reach my parents, he called the pastor of our church and asked him to relay the message that he had a job for me, but I must report for duty early the next morning. The pastor drove out to our house and delivered the message. We got ourselves together quickly, and the pastor and I left around five o'clock the next morning to drive to the school. The name of the school was Mt. Pisgah. It was not in a town — just a little rural area. When I arrived I felt very lonely. It was my first time away from home all alone and the first job I had as a teacher. But as time went on I made friends. Walter Dickinson was one of the first friends I met. He was organist for the church.
When I got settled in the little community, I began giving little programs on holidays for the school children. The only music I had was the church organ. The church deacons agreed to let me use the organ for my programs. They would move the organ from the church to the schoolhouse, and Walter Dickinson would play for my programs. From that contact we became quite friendly. Finally we began going out together as young people will do, and eventually it led to marriage.
I began teaching at Mt. Pisgah in 1924. It was 1925, the next year, that we were married. I tried hard to make a go of it, because I guess he was a nice person, but he was a rural farmer, and of course we had different views and different values. He wanted me to give up teaching, but I was not willing to do that at the time. Then he vowed that teaching or not, I must help him with the farm work as other farmers' wives did. Trying to be compatible, I agreed to help. So when school was out every afternoon, I went home and changed into work clothes, and joined the field hands to help pick the cotton, cultivate the tobacco, gather the corn, or do whatever they were doing. I was trying to get along with the family, trying to be a "nice guy."
After a while I became very tired and couldn't keep up the pace. My husband was sharecropping with his father. And he would tell me that, at the end of the year when the crops were sold, he and his father would divide the money equally. Then we would have some money of our own. But at the end of the year, they came out with no money at all. In fact they were in debt to the landlord. This was not unusual among sharecroppers. The system was that the cropper could borrow money throughout the year, from the farm owner, for the necessary clothing for the family and other incidentals. In addition, the landlord would furnish food for the family. The sharecroppers themselves seldom kept records. So it was customary﻿14
AAD: (cont.) that at the end of the year, when the boss's account books were checked, the cropper would always come out in debt, or come out "in the hole," as they termed it.
This situation made me very unhappy, because I had been lending them money that I was making teaching school, and helping carry some of the family responsibilities. The family finance, or lack of it, brought very bad feelings between us. The unpleasantness continued to grow until finally he decided that we would move away from his family, at my request.
So we moved to a little town, Hopkinsville, twenty-one miles or so from where we were living. When we got there, neither of us had a job. He didn't try to get one. Being a farm boy, I don't think he knew how to do any other type of work. We lived off the little money I had saved. I had to pay the moving expense, the first month's rent, and buy the necessary furniture on installment. It wasn't long before my money began to run out. Somebody had to go to work, and it happened to be me. He kept saying he couldn't find a job. He would go out every morning, supposedly job seeking, but he never had any luck.
Then I went out job seeking, going from house to house, looking for domestic employment. The only work I could find was that of a nursemaid. I didn't like that, because I knew nothing about caring for babies. Finally I went into the home laundry business, just as my mother had done. Walter would sit on the porch and swing, while I tugged the bundles of dirty clothes home, washed and ironed them, and carried each family's clean laundry home in big baskets.
We used coal in those days in the kitchen stove, on which I had to heat my wash water. Since there wasn't much money, I had to buy the coal by the bushel. I hired a little boy across the street to pull the bushel of coal home in his little red wagon. He was too small to pull the wagon alone, and I had to go along and help, by pushing the wagon while he pulled. This was most embarrassing. That went on until I could stand it no longer. And too, winter was coming on, and I couldn't do a lot of laundry work, since the clothes had to be dried out-of-doors. It would have been impossible to dry a lot of clothes during the bad rainy or cold weather. I assured him that something else had to be done. That is exactly what he wanted. I think that is why he wouldn't get a job or help me in any way. He knew that after a while, I could give up and agree to move back to the country.
We did move, not back to his parents' home, but on the outskirts of another little town called Pembroke. Here he made a trade to work as a sharecropper. We moved in a tenant farmhouse, that I often speak of as being comparable to Snuffy Smith's house of comic strip fame. It was all open, with cracks in the walls, and a leaky roof. Neither of us had any money, so he arranged for both of us to rise at five o'clock in the morning, and go up to what they called the "big house" (just like they did in slavery days), and do chores for food. To pay for our breakfast, he would milk the cows and I would cook the breakfast and wash the dishes. This held true for the other meals.﻿15
AAD: (cont.) Things continued to get worse and I couldn't stand that any
longer. So I began looking for another school. I was finally called to teach at a school in Allensville the following fall. He still objected to my teaching. He told me that I ought to stay at home, as a farmer's wife should, and help with the crops. If I needed extra money I could always earn it by washing clothes for some of these good white folks.
Well, anyway, I took the job in this school, which was a little better school than the one I had previously. The first was a one-room school, and this was a two-room, two-teacher school. I worked there for about three years, I think, two or three years, until my certificate expired. This meant that I had to go back to school for a whole year, to renew my certificate. While planning to go back to West Kentucky College, he told me that he didn't want me to teach, and if I insisted on going back to school, I could just go and stay. So I went! And I stayed! That is the last time I ever saw Walter Dickinson.
MMG: Did Mr. Dickinson regard your teaching as an eccentricity for a woman or what?
AAD: Well, I think so. I think the one thing which "bugged" him most was
the people in the neighborhood, who kept needling him about his wife not working—not helping him with the crops. Apparently they didn't consider teaching school as working. Some of the people, who opposed his marrying me, kept telling him that "other people's wives have to work, why can't yours work?" They referred to me as a "parlor princess," or something like that. Some would say, "Oh, she doesn't want you. You're just a poor farm boy and she's a 'parlor princess-' She just wants to sit in the parlor (meaning the schoolhouse) all day doing nothing."
MMG: It wasn't really working.
AAD: Yes. They felt that while they were out in the hot sun working in the fields, I was doing nothing but sitting in the house in the shade. I think they just pumped that into his mind to the point where he was trying to please the neighbors and the family. There were no children from that marriage. So our marriage came quietly to an end.
MMG: You mentioned the fact there was a second husband.
AAD: Yes, I came back to Russellville, after I had finished my course at West Kentucky College. Then I began teaching in my home county. It was the first professional job I had ever held in my own home area. I believe I stayed on that job about six years. That was another one-room school. After a length of time, schools were being consolidated throughout the county. Many rural schools were closed, and many teachers lost their jobs. I happened to be one of the fortunate who got a job in the only black high school in the county. I taught there for about four years. There were six teachers at that school at the time. Eventually the four years of high school were removed from that location and consolidated with the so-called "city" high school. That meant the loss of two teachers from the staff of﻿16
AAD: (cont.) the Adairville (Logan County) High School. I was one of those let out and had to find myself another job. I was appointed to another rural school called Keysburg, where I worked for one full year and was beginning my second term, when I took the Civil Service examination and came to Washington.
In the meantime while I was living back in Russellville, and working in my own home county, this former boyfriend, Charles Dunnigan, who had been my brother's playmate as a child, and I guess you could call him my childhood sweetheart, came back to town. He had been away for a number of years, and had married and lived in Louisville with his wife until she died. After her death he returned home. I was just returning from college, and there we both were, old friends, both single again. We began going out together to the movies and parties and so forth. After a time we were married. Here again was a matter of incompatibility. I was interested in intellectual things. He was not. Our friends were different. Our outlooks were different. Our interests were different.
Anyway, I tried to adjust to his way of life, and to stay with him as long as I could... but I did marry against my parents' will, because they felt that he was not the right person for me. In my autobiography I refer to him as sort of a "good time Charlie." Anyway, he was a man of the world, and he liked fun and good times. My mother knew that from his early days, but I didn't realize it because, I guess, I was blindly in love. So anyway, because my parents objected to our marriage and predicted that we wouldn't be able to stay together for two months, I put up with an awful lot of unpleasant things to prove that we could live together. And we did live together for about twenty years.
We had one child. My parents took our baby to raise when he was only four months old, so that I could continue working to support myself and my son. I had discovered that I couldn't depend upon my husband for support. Our son, Robert William (Bob), was in his second year of college when my mother died. I worked hard, and kept him in school until he finished at Kentucky State College.
After Bob had finished college, and my mother had passed on, I felt that I no longer had to take the abuses I had been taking from my husband, just to keep my mother happy, and to shield my son from the embarrassment of being the product of a broken home. Since Charles Dunnigan and I had been friends all of our lives, we made no great fuss or fanfare about our separation. We just decided to live our separate lives, go our separate ways and remain friends. And that's the way it happened and has continued that way until this day.
MMG: Your son's name is Robert William and we know that, as you've just said, he graduated from Kentucky State?
AAD: Yes.
MMG: Could you say a little more about your son?
AAD; Yes. After finishing Kentucky State, Bob went into the military service,﻿17
AAD: (cont.) into the marines, where he stayed for four years. After coining out of the service he engaged in several types of jobs. He taught school in Maryland for two or three years, serving as coach and director of athletics. He worked as a counselor at a correction school for boys for a time. Then he went into the District government for a while. Then he went into a national joint industry and government training and employment program for youth. Then back into a local government training program for youth, under the auspices of the mayor of the District of Columbia. A few years ago, about 1975, he went in the business involving his first love— which is racehorses. He bought a farm in Maryland where he breeds, boards, and conditions racehorses. Being from Kentucky, he would naturally be interested in racehorses.
MMG: Yes. How important have friends been in your life? Are there any friends that you'd like to mention who have been particularly close?
AAD: No. I don't think so. Of course, I have a lot of friends, but I don't
think of any who have been close enough to really have been of service to me, other than the Dr. Russell who laid the groundwork for me to go to school many years ago. No one has advanced any money, or assisted me in getting any type of grant to help finance any of my writing projects, nor have they offered any special job or promotional opportunities. There have been many people, however, who have given me moral support.
MMG: You'd say you were more, maybe, of a loner then?
AAD: I think so. I have on my wall upstairs in my bedroom a picture of a wolf.
MMG: A lone wolf.
AAD: Yes, I think it's very fitting for me.
MMG: Mrs. Dunnigan, you've had so many careers, been a wife and mother, reporter, a schoolteacher, a home economist; you've worked as a federal employee with secretarial skills; you've studied economics; and I don't know, there might be even others that I haven't thought of or can't remember. What I want to ask you though is, do you view these careers in any particular order of importance?
AAD: Yes. I think my journalism career is the most important. I think I've done more in that field to help people, to bring about better race relations, and it was an enjoyable career. And I think that's the greatest field. I've worked in politics too; you didn't mention that one. That was an interesting, exciting and rewarding experience.
MMG: Oh, I didn't...
AAD: And you said I studied economics, but you didn't say I worked as an
economist in the federal government. I did that too. Well, I do think the journalism is my most important career. And I do love what I'm doing now, writing my autobiography, and researching material for publication. I love doing that. I think that'll be my contribution to the world, if I ever get﻿18
AAD: (cont.) it published. That is some information that should be left for posterity.
MMG: What have your experiences been in trying to accommodate a public and
private life? You've already give us an indication of what it was like with Mr. Dickinson, trying to accommodate a public and private life. Is there anything else you could say about that? What sort of tensions developed in the effort to accommodate the two, and how did you resolve them?
AAD: Well, I think we've just mentioned how I resolved the first one, by just leaving him, and of course the same was true of the second husband. With the second husband there was a great deal of tension. I think maybe it was jealousy. I don't mean jealous sex-wise, but I mean that he didn't like the fact that I was recognized as a leader and a very prominent speaker. He showed resentment by never going any place to hear me speak. He even resented compliments from his friends on my performance. I guess the only way we could resolve that was by going in different directions. He went his way with his friends, and I went my way with mine. This went on for years. We seldom, if ever, went out together, were rarely at home together, and hardly made conversation together. This way of life was certainly not to my liking, but I tried to adjust to it. There was tension. There was unhappiness. I think we resolved it by deciding that we would not consider ourselves as companions, or as husband and wife, but just as friends. This kind of lifestyle made our separation easier when we decided to make it official.
MMG: How about your child, your son? Did he ever resent your public life?
AAD: No, I don't think so. I don't think he showed it. Some people say he
resents it even now, but I don't know that he does. Sometimes I think that he doesn't appreciate me enough, but my friends say that's always true in any family, and some of my friends say, well, he resents you because you're the woman and recognized more. I'm getting more publicity, not making more money. So I don't really know if he resents it, or whether he just accepts me as a matter of course. To him, everything I'm trying to do is just ordinary.
MMG: Do you have preference among the terms "colored," "Negro," "black?" And if you do, why?
AAD: I have no special preference now. There was a time when I preferred the term "Negro," because that was popular in my generation. When the trend changed to "black," oh, I almost died. I thought, "I just can't accept that." I didn't want to say it at all. But since it is now the fad, people say it all the time. I have gotten used to it, and I prefer using it. I go along with whatever the trend is. When it was "colored," I went along with that. But sometimes in my writing I have the problem on which term I should use. If one only uses "black, black, black" all the way through an article, it becomes so monotonous that it actually sounds bad. For a little variety I sometimes use the word "Negro" or "colored" or "Afro-American" or "nonwhite" and sometimes even used the once accepted choice, "the race."﻿19
MMG: Well, how has being a Negro, a black woman, affected the options available to you in your life, in the choices that you've made?
AAD: Being...
MMG: Race is the main focus that I want to get at in this part of the question.
AAD: There has always been a racial problem. I didn't particularly recognize it in my early childhood. I do remember, as I look back now, a situation I encountered as a young child, about ten years old or so. The scene was the county courthouse, which had only one rest room marked "white ladies." That was the only public rest room in the little village. There were not even rest rooms for blacks in the stores. Country people had a custom of congregating in town on Saturday afternoons, and standing around on the street, greeting friends, swapping gossip, and exchanging small talk. My mother would carry me along on those "street social hours." Whenever I had to go to the rest room, I would head straight for the courthouse, and into the "white ladies" rest room. My mother opposed this action. Oh, she would get so mad with me, ordering me to stay out of the "white folks'" toilet. "Them white folks gonna get you in there some day, and beat you half to death, and there's nothing I can do about it." Nothing ever happened! Nobody ever said a word! But gosh, they did give me some nasty looks.
Even after I had become grown and was teaching school in the county, the situation at the courthouse had remained unchanged. As a county schoolteacher I was subjected to the standard rule of bringing the eighth grade graduating class to the courthouse for the final examination. This applied to all schools in the county, both black and white. Only one other black school showed up for the final examination the year I carried my students. That class was escorted by a male teacher. Therefore, the girls of both schools had to depend upon me for guidance and protection.
Their greatest problem was the availability of a usable rest room. They would come to me and ask, "Miss Alice, where can we go to the john?" "Go in there where the white children are going," I would advise. "But that says 'white ladies' and we are afraid to go in there." So I would have to escort each one of them in, whenever they had to go.
I think there must have been some protest from the white teachers. Although they said nothing to me directly, at one point the superintendent's administrative assistant presented me with a key to a special private rest room, and advised me not to instruct my children to use the white ladies' rest room. The rest room she made available to the black students was really the one used by the superintendent's staff. It had an elaborate lounge that was clean and well kept. So we had use of the best, the most comfortable and the most convenient rest room after all. That was really my first real confrontation with authorities on the race question. I considered it a quiet but significant victory.
Of course, when I became more mature, more observant and more race-conscious,﻿20
AAD: (cont.) I noted many city services which needed correcting. For instance, I became aware that mail was not delivered in the black community. Black people had become accustomed to having their mail addressed "General Delivery," which meant that they had to pick up their mail personally at the post office. Mail was delivered daily in the white section.
There were no gas or water lines installed in the 'tolored area." Residents in those areas had to use coal or kerosene for heating and cooking. I used to wonder what would happen had a big fire broken out in the area—fortunately none ever did while I was living there.
I was very resentful that black taxpayers were denied the very minimal services, and I let my views be known to city officials. The postmaster defended their policy by stating that there were no paved sidewalks in that area, and the law did not demand the delivery of mail on muddy streets. "Why
aren't the streets paved in that area, as they are in other sections of the city?" was my next question. "Colored folks don't want paved streets," was the reply. "They are not willing to pay the city half of the cost of paving them."
The utility people used the same excuse. "Colored people don't want gas and water installed on their streets," said the spokesman. "They say they can't afford to be paying extra gas and water bills. And they further state that they are afraid that the installation of these conveniences will result in increased taxes on their property."
I was very annoyed by the allegations made by the city officials, and very disgusted with the home owners if they were true. I discussed this situation with my brother-in-law, who is a preacher, and together we decided to try and do something about it. I had realized by this time that I could not fight the battle alone. There were no civic organizations in that town, no Urban League, no NAACP, or not even a local labor union. So my brother-in-law and I called together the citizens of these ghetto areas to meet at a church one Sunday afternoon, to discuss these conditions and try to find a solution. We had planned to organize a united front which we would call the Russellville Civic League.
The people came but they were noncommittal to our suggestions. While they didn't exactly speak out publicly, in opposition to our proposal that demands be made for equal treatment as citizens and property owners, neither did they express approval. Their attitudes indicated that they had made the statements charged to them by city officials sometime earlier on (before I got involved), when proposals for improving the area were discussed. Due to their attitude, we got no results from our effort. No additional utilities were installed, and no mail was delivered.
MMG: This was in the thirties? The time period we're talking about, is that right?
AAD: Yes, I think so. I think it must have been about the thirties. Since we didn't make much headway on the first complaints, we introduced another﻿21
AAD: (cont.) subject. That of low wages paid working women. I didn't know anything about organized labor, but I had admired their position on the rights of working people, from what I had heard. We instructed the women that, if they would organize themselves and stick together, they could demand better wages. The majority of nonprofessional black women in our town was engaged as cooks. There was nothing else there that they could do. No other work was available. The standard wage for women who prepared three meals a day for white families was five dollars per week. Those who cooked only two meals—breakfast and a heavy midday meal, which they called dinner— received three dollars per week.
My brother-in-law and I tried to impress upon the cooks the importance of organizing themselves into a united group similar to a labor union. Agree upon a decent wage scale and decline to accept any job offer below the set scale. In that way the white housewives would be forced to pay their price. Many of these women resented our suggestions, on the grounds that they had to work. And if they refused to accept the job and the wages offered, somebody else would. Some even became indignant, and struck back with the idea that "You two can afford to talk big. One of you is a preacher and the other is a teacher. You don't have to depend upon these 'white folks' for a living. We do! And we ain't gonna let you make us lose our jobs."
Some of these women reported to their "bosses"the first thing Monday morning about our meeting. Soon word was circulating around town that Alice Dunnigan and Reed Langley were trying to get the "colored folks in Black Bottom" to turn against the "white folks" in town—to refuse to work for them, or to demand more money. Said we were trying to make them lose their jobs. This rumor put both the Reverend and me in bad graces with both the white and black communities. The idea backfired, and instead of the cooks losing their jobs as they indicated, I almost lost mine.
Another racial incident which comes to mind involves an occasion when I was teaching school in Adairville and commuting from Russellville on the school bus. One afternoon I came home with a terrible migraine headache. I stopped in a drugstore to buy some aspirins and a Coke. I specifically asked for a bottle of Coke. The clerk sold me the aspirin and the Coke, instructing me that I would have to drink it outside. "That's why I asked for a Coke in a bottle," I flashed back. "I knew I wouldn't be allowed to sit in a booth. I just want one or two swallows to wash this aspirin down." Nevertheless, I had to carry it out onto the street. By this time I had become very sick. My head was hurting worse and my stomach was terribly upset. I sat down on the curb, sipping from my bottle of Coke, and regurgitating all on the sidewalk. This was most embarrassing because everybody knew me. A group of white people passed by, then turned around and looked at me, as I heard one ask, "Isn't that the Adairville teacher?" This made me feel that they thought I was sitting there on the pavement drunk, or something. Nobody stopped to ask if I was sick, or if they could help me in any way. I knew that this impression would give me a bad reputation, and I wished to myself that I had stayed inside, and vomited right on the drugstore floor. These are just a few of the racial situations which I experienced in Kentucky.﻿22
MMG: Would you mind recounting one other experience that impressed me a lot in reading your autobiography? That's your experience in Russellville during the Depression. You talked about when the WPA projects finally came to that area.
AAD: Back to the seven-months school. Working in a seven-months school,
where the highest salary I ever got was $86 a month for a seven-month term, and the lowest I received was $63 for seven months, it was impossible to save enough money to tide you over the five months of unemployment. So when school closed, the teacher had to find some supplementary income. There was nothing for a black woman to do but find a job "in the white folks' kitchen," as they used to say, and earn that three or five dollars, or whatever they were paying, in addition to food.
Then the WPA was established in the county, but it employed only white women. 1 have always been somewhat of a politician, so I was in a position to ask the man in charge of the project (who was a local politician) why they employed no blacks, since this was a federal project. He told me quite confidentially that the reason they didn't hire black women was due to protest raised by the white women of the town. They claimed that because the WPA was paying a dollar a day for workers, it would attract all of the household .help from their kitchens. They, the housewives, just couldn't compete with the federal government. As administrator of the program, he was unofficially trying to comply with the white women's requests. He said, "If you don't tell anybody this, I'll put you on the project, but we are not giving anybody a whole week's work. We're only giving people one day's employment a week." He further promised to put on some other black women. "Now, if you don't say anything, I'll give you two days' work a week." He employed a few blacks according to promise. He gave me two days' work, while the other women were getting only one day per week. They couldn't understand how that happened. They complained among themselves, but since no public protest was made of it, nothing was changed.
I held several jobs that summer. It might be hard to believe, but I was working at a milk dairy four hours a day — two in the mornings and two in the afternoons— for $2.00 a week. I worked on WPA, two days for $2.00 per week. And I was working at another place between times, cleaning house for a family five days for $1.50 per week. Then I was doing a washing for a family at night for $1.50 a week. Remember I had no washing machine, and the clothes had to be rubbed on a scrub board and ironed by hand. Altogether I was earning around $7.00 per week.
Back to the WPA program. Black women and white women were assigned to different jobs. White women were working on a sewing project. They were making dresses and shirts for the underprivileged children from material furnished by the government. Another group of white women was patching torn schoolbooks with scotch tape. They worked directly in the superintendent's office.
When black women were hired they had no work to do. Jobs had to be made for them. First they gave us the job of cleaning all of the public buildings﻿23
AAD: (cont.) in the city: a small town like that has very few public buildings.
We had two white colleges, one for boys and one for girls. We spent an awful lot of time cleaning those four buildings. We washed the walls, we washed the windows, and did everything that we could possibly find to be done. Then they sent us to clean the county courthouse, then the jail, and finally the calaboose. The latter was a little building where men were kept who were arrested for minor crimes, such as hoboes taken from freight trains, during these Depression days, and arrested for vagrancy. They were punished by making them break rock on a rock pile to pay their fines. The calaboose was infected with lice. When we discovered this, and refused to work there any longer, we were given the day off and instructed to go home, take a hot bath, and burn the clothes we were wearing. This ended our cleaning at places of detention.
The officials began to wonder what else they could find for us to do. Then they came up with the idea of sending us to the "colored cemetery" to dig wild onions out of the ground. We would sit around on the ground all day, or crawl around on our knees with a little spade digging up wild onions. Just beyond the cemetery was a junk yard, or a dump pile, where the grocery stores would dump their garbage every morning. We would watch for the grocery trucks to come. Then we would all race over to the dump and pick out any decayed food from which we thought we might find a few edible bits. We would pick out hot dogs and baloney and stuff that was molded a little, carry it home, scrape off the mold, soak it overnight and eat it. We would also pick out such food as half-rotten cabbage, potatoes and apples, cut off the rotten spots and prepare them for eating. That became a daily routine with all of us black women workers. After we had dug all of the wild onions from the colored cemetery, we were assigned to the white cemetery.
The white cemetery was well kept. The lawn was nice and green. No weeds or wild onions grew there. So we were given the task of washing tombstones. It was this incident which supplied materials for a magazine article, appearing in a national magazine years later, which the author titled something like, "It is a long way from tombstone washer to White House reporter— but Alice Dunnigan made it."
After all of the tombstones in the white cemetery had been scrubbed, there just wasn't anything else for us to do, except sweep the streets. That I refused to do. I felt that I had done enough degrading work, and I had no intention of sweeping streets like a convict. So I left the job. I could afford to quit now because it was near the time for my school to start. So I gave up all of the jobs I was holding, and returned to my teaching job. That was my experience with the OTA program during the Depression years.
MMG: Were black and white women paid the same? Were they all paid one dollar a day?
AAD: I think they all might have been paid one dollar a day. But I think the white women were allowed to work five days a week.﻿24
MMG: And what were the jobs... the jobs for the white women didn't run out? They continued to work on textbooks and made clothes?
AAD: Yes, they continued. I don't know for how long that project lasted, because I left it and, well, I guess when the allotted amount of money ran out, the program was discontinued.
MMG: Were there any other times later, let's say further on in your career,
after you'd come to Washington, when you felt that race was an inhibiting, a severely inhibiting factor?
AAD: Yes. I found discrimination in Washington when I came here. First of all, I was very dissatisfied when I found that grade 2, clerk-typist, was almost at the bottom of the economic ladder. That wasn't anybody's fault but mine. That was the only examination offered in the Kentucky post office where I took mine, and I didn't know any better. When I took my $1440-a~year job, and found some Howard University students working there part time being paid $1620, on grade level 3, I was very upset. I had taught school for a number of years, had spent some time doing public speaking, and was recognized as a writer of sorts, so I couldn't see why I should be working for less money than a college student. So I began to protest. The section of government in which I was working had a little shop union which went to bat for me. Finally I was promoted to a grade 3, assistant statistical clerk, making $1620. After working there for a while, I felt that I was still far below my capabilities. Again I protested and was promoted to a grade 4, statistical clerk, making $1800 a year.
I knew there was a great demand for economists, so I applied for an economist's job. I attended Howard University for a whole year in the evenings, studying economics to prepare myself for an economist job which I finally got. That paid $2000 a year, and I thought I was really making big money then. I hadn't had that job long before the war ended and the war agencies were closed.
An effort was made to find jobs for people who were without employment. I found it was difficult for black women to get a job beyond a grade 4. I think Congressman Adam Powell talked about that a great deal, and he was right. Black people with a grade CAF-5, or a P-l (Professional 1) rating, who were fired due to termination of their jobs, found it most difficult to get another job on that level. A sort of employment agency was set up within the OPA (Office of Price Administration), where I worked, to help match personnel with available jobs in other agencies- I was rejected everywhere I was sent for an interview. It was generally agreed that these rejections came to all black people who were seeking jobs on a professional level, even if it was only the first step in the professional bracket.
On one occasion, I was sent by the OPA personnel people on an interview for a library job at Walter Reed hospital. They had already evaluated my qualifications, and noted that I had a number of college hours in library science. When I reported for the interview, I was told that no such vacancy﻿25
AAD: (cont.) existed. When I reported this back to the placement officer in my agency, he blasted out, "He's a damn liar. They do have such a job. If they didn't want a Negro woman, why in the hell didn't they say so?"
Soon I was sent on another interview in another medical library. "I know they have a vacancy there for a librarian," the placement officer assured me. When I arrived, the personnel officer looked at my college transcript, and found that I had a sufficient number of college hours in library science to qualify me for the job. Then he began to question me on my experience as a librarian. After telling him the length of time I had worked in a library, he asked, "Was this full-time or part-time employment?" I had to say "part-time," because I was teaching in a school and serving part-time as a school librarian. That was all he was looking for— an excuse for an out. "Well, you are not qualified," he blabbed out almost gleefully. "You are required to have a certain number of years' experience— full time." So 1 missed out there.
The placement agent sent me to another job. And he says,"I know this is a sure thing, because this job is at the Office of Education, and they're asking for something that nobody else in this office is qualified for. They're looking for a person who's an educator and writer. You have training in education, ami you've had experience in writing. You are the very person for this job. Tt^s jtast tailor-made for you." I went over to the Office of Education to place my application. The girl with whom I talked informed me that the personnel officer was out sick, and suggested that I call within a few days. I called later, and was told that he was still out sick. I kept calling and calling and always received the same information. Finally, in response to one of my calls, she stated that, "The job has been filled." So the job was filled without ever interviewing me, or even looking at my qualifications at all. I know that these three incidents were racial.
MMG: Now a parallel question: How has being a woman affected the options available to you and the choices you've made?
AAD: The opposition I met as a woman correspondent in the Capitol galleries came mainly from a black man. The only black male correspondent in the galleries was accredited only a few days before I received my accreditation. He always showed prejudice to me, perhaps due to competition. He even resented my asking questions of the president. After another black woman came to Washington, Ethel Payne of the Chicago Defender, and received accreditation to the Capitol and White House, he started a protest against her. He gave both Ethel and me all kinds of problems. On one occasion he wrote in his column that we were trying to outdo each other by seeing which could ask the longest questions of the president.
At another time, when ~we were both doing little extra jobs on the side to supplement our salaries, he attempted to undercut us by having our Capitol and White House credentials nullified. I had a little job writing speeches for a top-flight woman in government. Ethel was doing some editorial writing﻿26
AAD: (cont.) for a little magazine put out by the CIO. Our male colleague reported my activities to the gallery officials suggesting that my Capitol pass be cancelled. He reported Ethel to White House authorities asking that her White House pass be annulled.
The NAACP came to our rescue, through one of its columnists who wrote that almost all of the white reporters do extra jobs. Some do commercials on TV, some write speeches for politicans or other public speakers, some accept speaking engagements around the country, some serve as literary agents, some do public relations and other types of related jobs. "Why not these two women?" The debate drew quite a bit of controversy. In trying to compare the source of my biggest problem, I concluded that it was based on sex rather than race.
MMG: Why do you think that is? Do you have any theories?
AAD: I don't know. It's perhaps jealousy, that's all I know. White men don't care about your work. I mean they might object to you being there, but they're not going to say anything. I found that out when I was working in the galleries. They might disapprove of your presence, but they don't bother you, because really you're no threat to them or their work. They just ignore you entirely. Just pass you up, as if you weren't there. I found this to be true also when working in the government or independent agencies. When whites disapprove of you, they just pass you up, as if you were a chair or a piece of furniture—just ignore you. I don't think they particularly try to hurt you. They just try to make you feel insignificant, like you're nothing.
MMG: You've mentioned earlier that you feel that of all your many careers, journalism has really been the most important one. Could you give us just a brief account of how your interest in writing began, and then how that particular career developed?
AAD: Well, I've always been interested in writing as far back as I can remember.
In grade school, I remember in the eighth grade, I used to always write, you know, poems and little short stories and compositions and so on. And my teachers, especially my eighth grade teacher, always encouraged me to qualify myself as a writer, and she gave me inspiration and encouragement. And, of course, I did these things for a while, and then I decided that I wanted to be a journalist. I got in contact with a newspaper. Oh, I ought to say first, though, that there were no black newspapers in that area where I lived. We didn't even see them. They didn't circulate there, so why I was interested in black newspapers I can hardly say, but I do know that I was interested. And I found out where the closest black newspaper was being published, in another little town.
I contacted this editor and told him my interest. So he had me to write a little column every week. The paper had a full page on what was called "Home Town News." People from various little towns would send in a column﻿27
AAD:
MMG: AAD:
(cont.) of what I called "one-sentence" stories to be included on that page. I began submitting that same type of column. It was a lot of fun, but no money. At first the editor gave me a small space. I could sell the paper to everyone whose name I used. The more names I'd use, the more space he would allow me. The more space, the more names. The more names, the more papers I could sell. This became a round robin but my column grew. He would send me copies of the paper, which were sold for a nickel a copy. I could keep about three cents from each copy I sold.
I remember one time, I did a little one-sentence story about an automobile being struck by a train, but no one was injured. That was just a little thing, but I guess the paper was scarce of news that week, so they took the little sentence out of context, and blew it up into a big front-page story with a bold black streaming headline across the top of the page. The editor made up a story — just sort of built up an imaginary story. Anvhow, T was proud of that headline, and vowed then and there that, "Someday I am going to have many headlines and by-lines." I think it was that incident which gave me inspiration and encouragement.
That first little paper was the Owensborough Enterprise?
That's right. And I guess that's why I've always realized that there was a need for cross-communication between black communities, and as I've just mentioned, there weren't any newspapers in my little home town, so I felt that I just sort of lived an isolated life, completely unaware of what my people were doing in other parts of the world. So I had this growing desire to be a newspaperwoman. I said, "I'm going to keep the public informed on what's happening around the nation, and especially among black people." And I wanted to be able to keep all the communities informed on what was being said and done in other locales. And again, I wanted to provide a platform for an interchange of thoughts and opinions on current issues.
As a writer I had hoped to perform sort of a watchdog function for black communities, publicizing and protesting injustices imposed upon black society, and to suggest a course of action for correcting these impositions. And as a journalist, again, I felt that it was my responsibility to analyze existing situations. I found this out more since I came to Washington, my responsibility of analyzing legislative proposals as they affect minority groups, and of offering suggestions on how these unfavorable pieces of legislation can be defeated. As a writer I thought that I could point out all the goods and the evils that existed in our society, and recommend steps that could be taken to correct the evils. Again, a newspaper reporter has the opportunity of preserving black culture, by keeping alive the interest in historic events and folk stories, by writing contemporary history, as well as publishing success stories of black people which might be inspirational to young people. Journalists have the opportunity of recording stories of individual and group achievement that might well be kept for posterity and might enlighten generations to come. That was my idea of the type of contributions made by top-flight journalists. That is why I went into it.﻿28
MMG: Then after you entered the field professionally, what were some of your major achievements?
AAD: I went into the field professionally after the war agency closed in Washington, and I was made chief of the Washington bureau of the Associated Negro Press. But prior to that I had been writing for newspapers all during my teaching career. I would write articles and little stories and poems for newspapers. So my greatest, what I felt one of my greatest achievements, was that of breaking down discrimination in the press gallery. I think that was one of the greatest things that has happened in my career. I didn't break it down alone, of course, but I led the fight, and as a result of my leading the fight, discrimination was broken down. Although the gallery people always denied that the lack of blacks in the gallery was racial. They said it was because the blacks did not meet certain qualifications. The qualifications being that an accredited newsman had to be a reporter for a daily paper. There were no black daily papers with reporters in Washington. There were no white papers there that had black reporters. So no blacks qualified. And that's why, after the long fight, I guess, the Senate Rules Committee called a hearing on the situation, and changed the rules so as to admit heads of news agencies. I was the one who put the first application in; I was the one who kept the thing going, so X think that was one of my greatest achievements.
MMG: And so you became the first black woman to enter the Capitol press corps?
AAD: And what is so strange, after I kept the wheel rolling as you might say, when they did change the rules and the standing committee of the press gallery decided they would take blacks, they first admitted the one black male reporter that I have been talking about all along. He and I were the only two heads of black news agencies in Washington. They brought him in as the first, and it wasn't but two or three days, or maybe a week later, that I was accredited, but I was the second choice. After I was admitted to the press galleries in the Capitol, there was no problem in being permitted to the White House Press Association, and then to the State Department. And it comes on down the line. I had no problem until I applied for a Metropolitan Police pass in Washington, and was opposed, again by a black male. But it came out all right.
MMG: And these were all firsts. When you became the first black woman White House correspondent, Truman was president and your first participation in a white House press conference was in August of 1947. In fact, all of these accreditations were granted in 1947. And then you went on to become a member of the State Department Press Association, and finally the Washington Police pass did come through...
AAD: It came through.
*®*G: Right.
AAD: And I, of course, I got an accreditation from the Supreme Court; that was no problem, just applied, and the pass was issued.﻿29
MMG: And the First Lady's press conference, you got credentials for that as well?
AAD: I don't think they have those any more, but they did under Mrs. Roosevelt and Mrs. Truman. Of course, I went in under Mrs. Truman. After that, I don't think the women continued to have press conferences.
MMG: Are there any other achievements, professional achievements, that you are particularly pleased with?
AAD: Did I mention my travel with Truman? I'm very pleased with that.
MMG: No, you haven't. Let's talk a little about that.
AAD: Okay. In 1948 during the Truman campaign, I happened to be one of the
correspondents who traveled with him on the first campaign train through, I suppose, about fifteen states between here and California. I thought that was an extra achievement for many reasons. Because it was the first time blacks had ever traveled with the president of the United States. Naturally it was the first time that women, well, black women, had traveled. So I felt like I was opening the doors for other black women, and also for the whole black press corps. You want to ask me about whether I had any problems on that trip?
MMG: Yes, let's hear about some of those. There were some interesting experiences on that trip.
AAD: I think the most interesting experience was in Cheyenne, Wyoming. I was
the only woman. I was one of two women reporters who went on this trip. The other woman reporter was Doris Fleeson, who was white. She went as far as Detroit, then left the train. I made the entire trip, so I was the only woman reporter who made the entire trip. Well, back to Cheyenne, Wyoming. We left the train, the president was going to the governor's mansion to make a speech, and of course, he went in one of the regular limousines as presidents usually do. It wasn't very far from the railroad track, where the train was sidetracked, to the governor's mansion, so the reporters decided they would walk. We walked down the middle of the street.(The street was blocked off for the occasion.) All the military was stationed on each side guarding the president and keeping the people back. So as I went along with the men, the white men reporters, and being the only black and the only woman, one of the military officers stepped out of rank and grabbed me in the collar, gave me a snatch, pushed me behind the lines and said, "Get back there behind this line where you belong." At that moment a white reporter stepped up and said, "I want you to know that you are messing with the party of the president of the United States. You know this woman is with us. She has a badge and she has it on."
MMG: And he knew, did he not, that you were accompanying the other pressmen?
AAD: Yes. And of course he made no further comment, he stepped back in formation,
and we went on. As far as I was concerned, the incident was closed. But later on as the train left there and went further and further, headed to Washington,﻿30
AAD: (cont.) that's Seattle, Washington... As we had settled down for the evening,
the train had stopped on a sidetrack, and everybody was composed for the night, and I had put a little table across my lap with a little portable typewriter, and started to write my copy for the day, there was a light tap on my compartment door, and in stepped the president of the United States. I was so flabbergasted because I had my bare feet up on the seat in front of me with my toes sticking up, and the table across my lap, preventing me from rising. I was bouncing up and down on the seat saying, "Mr. President. Mr. President." And he smiled as he said he just stopped by to see if I was being treated all right. I told him I was, and he said, "No, you haven't been. You had trouble in Cheyenne, Wyoming. I want you to know that any time anybody does anything to you on this trip, you're supposed to report directly to the president of the United States." That made me feel great and grand, gave me quite a great feeling of security.
MMG: What is your opinion, Mrs. Dunnigan, of the women's movement? First of all, what is the women's movement as you see it, and then secondly, what is your opinion of it?
AAD: Well, I don't quite know what the women's movement really is or what it stands for. So I guess I have mixed reactions on that particular subject. I think that women, like all other Americans, should have the right to pursue the type of jobs they want, and I definitely think that they should have equal pay for equal work. But I don't go along, I don't believe in all the things that I think the women's movement stands for. I don't see how a woman, or I don't see how a group of women, could ask or could fight for certain types of jobs that I don't think they can physically handle very well, any kind of job that would be detrimental to their health.
MMG: Like...
AAD: Well, I was just about to say... for example.
MMG: Oh, I'm sorry.
AAD: For example, there was a woman I think here in Washington who went to the
courts because she didn't get a job as a fireman (or fireperson). She did finally get the job but was fired when she was unable to do the work. I can't understand why a woman would want a job of that sort, when it means she'd have to pull those big heavy water hoses from wherever the truck is parked to the place where the fire is in progress. She couldn't do it, because the pipes are too heavy. Well, again, why would she want a job where she'd have to climb to the top of a tall building to rescue some survivors up there? Maybe it could be a big fat woman or a big heavy man, then she wouldn't be able to do that. So I don't think that we should go to extremes in asking for certain types of jobs.
There's another incident I remember reading in the paper, about a certain metropolitan city where the women were fighting for jobs on the loading platform of the post office. They employed a group of women, and these﻿31
AAD: (cont.) women soon found out that they had to lift those big heavy mail
sacks and throw them on the truck all day long. They just weren't physically able to cope with that type of work.
Let's see if I can think of another one now. Oh, there was another job that I can think of, where a woman applied for, and was given, a job as a telephone lineman. She had to climb to the top of the poles and pull the telephone wires up with her. She couldn't do it. And she became very indignant with the men who worked with her, thinking that they should help her carry the wires. Her male co-workers took the position that she asked for it, she got it, now let her handle it. So I think that within reason, we women must demand equal rights, but not fight for things that I don't think we can very well handle.
MMG: If a woman could take on a certain job of any of the type that you mentioned and handle it physically, then would you agree that she ought to...?
AAD: Yes. I think she should have the right if she wants to do it anyway; it's all right. I just don't see why they would fight for something if they think they can't do it. I watch T.V. sometimes when they have on those old war pictures. And I look at those men crawling through mud and through the underbrush and through the woods and through little bushes and wading water waist deep, and I say as I look on, "Why would a woman fight to be drafted into the military service to go into combat?" It's all right if she's going to be a nurse, a typist or office worker, but if she goes in and they give her combat duty, she'd have to take it. So I don't think that, I mean, it's all right, I guess, if they want to do it, but I don't think there are many women who want to do that.
And another point along this line that (maybe I'm a little different from the average woman, I don't know), but I don't believe in extreme independence. I take the position, from one viewpoint, that black women have for too long been forced into complete independence, having to play the supportive role for themselves and their children, and having been necessarily subjected to hard work as a means of supplementing the family income. Most black women might welcome the opportunity to have a reliable husband on whom they can depend for support, and to have a strong shoulder to lean on. I certainly would!
And furthermore, I am one of those women who enjoys being treated like a lady. I have no objection to a man on a crowded bus or in any crowded situation, getting up and giving me a seat. I feel that I am being respected, if a man opens a door for me, or if he helps me in and out of the car, or if he lights my cigarette, or holds my arm while crossing an icy street or busy thoroughfare. This is the type of courtesy that I adore. Special attention from a male knocks all ideas af women's lib from my mind. So I am not an extremely strong advocator, really, of ERA if it means abolishing or even amending women's protective laws that are already on the books, or if it means robbing or depriving women of their natural born femininity. This is the portion of the amendment that I am opposed to.﻿32
AAD: (cont.) On the other hand, I firmly believe that a woman has every right to any job that she is capable of filling physically and intellectually. I strongly support that section of the women's liberation movement and the Equal Rights Amendment which advocates and demands these rights. This might sound like double talk, but I said at the beginning that I had mixed feelings on this subject.
MMG: Do you feel that there's any particular deference that women should offer men because they're men? In other words, you've talked about men who extend certain courtesies, a seat on the bus and so on... Are there any parallel sorts of courtesies that you think women should extend to men because of their sex?
AAD: No, not really, not along those lines. I don't go along with the fact that a woman should bring her husband's slippers and newspaper when he comes in, or draw his bath water and do that kind of thing. i think these are things he is perfectly capable of doing for himself. I think you should treat him with respect and courtesy as you would any human being or business associate. But I don't think women should necessarily cater to men.
MMG: Something else too. When you say that women perhaps shouldn't be too independent, don't you think looking back on your own career, that there are probably a lot of people, both male and female, who felt Alice Dunnigan was too independent?
AAD: Probably so. But not too independent to receive courtesies from the male sex.
MMG: You have memberships and offices, have had offices, in many professional
and scholarly organizations. Are there any of these memberships or offices which you feel have been particularly rewarding?
AAD: Yes. I haven't held many offices in organizations because I don't like to be in the leadership position. I kind of like to stay in the background and keep things in order. Yes, I have worked in a number of organizations, especially the club which was called the Women's National Press Club at the time I joined. The name was later changed to Washington Press Club after opening its membership to male reporters.
The Women's National Press Club was very helpful in providing certain privileges which otherwise I would never have been able to obtain alone. I think they have done more in my behalf than any other group. For instance, when 100 newspaper reporters from Washington were given a free trip to Canada, prior to the opening of Expo '67, a member of the Women's National Press Club recommended that I be included. I was the lone black journalist. And without the support of the Press Club I would never have been invited.
My membership in this organization opened the way for my first trip overseas — to Israel. The Israeli government planned a trip for 100 newsmen from America﻿33
AAD: (cont.) to visit that country on its tenth birthday anniversary. A member
of the WPC suggested to a member of the New York Jewish organization which was coordinating the trip that, "You should include at least one Negro journalist. You ought to send Alice Dunnigan." The sponsoring organization agreed, and I was the only woman and the only black selected.
Of course, you know I traveled with Mrs. Lady Bird Johnson on a couple of trips. They were also arranged with the assistance of the Women's National Press Club.
I have been affiliated with a number of other organizations. One of which I am especially dedicated to is the Capital Press Club, because it was the first professional organization which I joined in Washington. It has been a very big factor in my success as a journalist.
I felt highly honored when I was invited to join the International Platform Association. I guess I felt honored because of the three important people who signed my letter of invitation to membership. They were Drew Pearson, Edgar Bergen and Hal Holbrook. The assumption that this membership offer represented personal recognition from such prominent people was indeed rewarding.
The National Association of Media Women gave a book party for me shortly after my book came off the press. The party was held in connection with its national convention held in New Orleans in 1974. I was made an honorary member of the organization at the time and presented an award of merit. This recognition coming from fellow journalists was very much appreciated.
A number of other organizations have presented awards for my work in journalism, community service, youth activities, employment opportunities, church work and politics. Each of these groups gave me encouragement and moral support. Included among them were the National Council of Negro Women, the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, and the National Association of Business and Professional Women. The National Business and Professional Women have given me two awards. One is known as the Sojourner Truth Award, which is the highest honor that the National Business and Professional Women's Club gives to people of distinction. So all in all, I guess all of them have been of some benefit to me.
MMG: I was going to ask you about your awards and honors. You had so many of them,
and maybe it's not a good idea to single out particular ones, but are there some of those awards and honors that you really feel are particularly satisfying?
AAD: Yes. It is maybe a little unfair to ask the question, because I don't want anybody to feel that I don't appreciate the awards presented me. But I do want to say that one of the awards that I greatly prize is the Kentucky Colonel Commission, which was presented by the governor of Kentucky. That is the highest honor that the State of Kentucky gives to its citizens.
Another unusual one, which I prize very highly, was the one given to me by President Francois Duvalier of Haiti. I think that was very rewarding because I had heard so many adverse criticisms on that country. When I visited the country and wrote about the situation as I saw it, the Haitian president sent me a very nice letter, thanking me for what he called "honest and unbiased"﻿34
AAD: (cont.) reporting on the conditions of his country. This complimentary letter was followed by an award from the president, which was presented, in a ceremony at the Haitian embassy, by the ambassador from that country and the minister counselor of Haiti to the Organization of American States.
From two trips around the country with Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson came two very unique and different awards, one for each trip, which are real conversation pieces. While traveling on one trip with the President and Mrs. Johnson, I had the opportunity to be among the invited guests to attend a reception at the mansion of the governor of Tennessee. From this contact, followed by a later trip to Nashville on a speaking engagement at Meharry Medical College, came an award from the Tennessee governor making me an honorary citizen of that state, "in recognition of outstanding qualities which merit the highest esteem of the citizens of the great Volunteer State." Another important recognition was an honorary Ph.D. degree presented in 1973 by the Colorado State Christian College at Evergreen, Colorado. I have a number of plaques and trophies besides the certificates of award. Several were presented by different departments of Howard University and various other organizations. I highly appreciate all of the honors which have been bestowed upon me from whatever source.
MMG: Do you have any hobbies and if so, what are they? You've been so busy!
AAD: I really don't have much time for hobbies, I stay so busy. But as I mentioned
early in our talk, my son has a racehorse farm, which means that he's interested in racehorses, and so am I. So one of my hobbies is horse racing. I like the beach, I like to lie in the sand, and wade in the water around the beach. It's one of my great pleasures in the summer. For recreation, I like sitting around sewing and crocheting and doing other handwork, which sort of takes my mind off the heavy things of life, and at the same time makes me feel like I'm creating something and doing something worthwhile. I believe those are my main hobbies. Horse racing, sewing, swimming.
MMG: You've traveled almost everywhere in the world but we haven't really discussed your travels as a separate subject. Where have you traveled?
AAD: Well, I've traveled all over the United States. I had a job working for President Johnson as educational consultant on the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, and one of my main responsibilities was traveling. So I went all over. I can't think of a state in the Union, hardly, that I haven't traveled in, including Hawaii. Outside of the United States I've already mentioned my going to Canada and I've mentioned also...
MMG: Israel.
AAD: ...Israel. Yes. En route to Israel, I had stop-offs in London and Paris. On the return trip I stopped off in Athens. One of my next trips was to the Dominican Republic, with a stop-off in San Juan, Puerto Rico, en route and in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on my return trip.
In 1968 I visited seven countries in South America. They were Peru, Chili, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, and Panama. I have also visited several﻿35
AAD: (cont.) cities in Mexico. My next trip was to Africa, with visits to
two European cities — London and Rome. In Africa I visited seven or eight countries. They included Tunisia, Nigeria, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Gambia. The latter country has recently been popularized as the scene of Alex Haley's famous book, Roots. I had no idea, at the time of my visit, that this little country would soon be recognized worldwide as a great historic center.
Later I made some Caribbean visits. The first was to Jamaica, where I visited the towns of Kingston, Ocho Rios and Montego Bay. The next was a cruise with stops in the Virigin Islands, Puerto Rico, Aruba and Curasao. And as I mentioned a little while ago, I did go to Hawaii. Although that's part of the United States, still to me it seems like a foreign country. So that about covers my travel, all I can think of at the moment.
MMG: Well, those are all the questions I have prepared for you. Is there any other comment or aspect of your life that you would like to speak of?
AAD: I could speak a little bit about my political experience. This includes a bit about discrimination in the federal government. In 1960 I worked in the political campaign. I don't think we talked at all about political campaigns, but I have worked in a number of them. In the '60 campaign, I worked for Senator Lyndon Johnson who was then candidate for president, along with Senators Kennedy, Humphrey and Symington. I went to the Democratic convention in Los Angeles as a guest of Senator Johnson. I traveled on his private plane and worked in the campaign upon my arrival in Los Angeles.
After Kennedy and Johnson teamed up and were elected president and vice president, one of the first things that President Kennedy did, after coming into office, was to issue an executive order setting up the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, and Vice President Johnson was made chairman. The vice president appointed me as education consultant for this committee. It was a nice job. It was a job where I think I fulfilled my duties very well. I think I did a great service to the country, for minority workers, as well as for the administration.
I traveled all over the country, attending all organizational conventions wherever they met. I visited schools and colleges, went to employment sites such as mines and factories, making public speeches, participating in workshops or holding individual conferences with labor, government and industry representatives --talking with them and trying to educate them on the work of the president's committee, offering suggestions on what they could do to help it achieve its purpose. At the same time informing them on what the committee could do for them, such as providing opportunities for job training, helping them find employment and assuring them equal job opportunities.
I stayed on that job, almost from the time the committee was established, until it was abolished by provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This act called for the replacement of the old Executive Order Committee with a permanent one called Equal Employment Opportunity Committee, now familiarly known as EEOC. With the abolition of the old committee, many staff members lost their jobs. I was fortunate enough to stay on the job for another year to help wind up affairs.﻿36
AAD: (cont.) After completing my work at PCEEO*, I was appointed editorial assistant for the President's Council on Youth Opportunity. The Youth Council was created by an executive order issued by President Johnson, and was chaired by Vice President Humphrey. It was on this committee that discrimination was discerned. Discrimination began to creep in after the administration changed, and Republicans began to replace Democrats on the Council staff.
MMG: This was after Nixon took office?
AAD: Yes. And Agnew was then made chairman of the Council. Soon the majority of
the Democratic staff members had quietly been replaced by Republican supporters. The Republicans were trying to get rid of me, because I was a Democratic appointee, but they didn't quite want to fire me, because they knew of my contacts with the black press and feared that there'd be some adverse publicity. Jet magazine had already carried a story saying that they were discriminating against me at the Council, because I was the only black professional left on the staff. So when the director would call meetings of the professional staff, he would fail to notify me. I went along with this omission for two or three meetings. Finally I got so angry that I blew my lid. I loudly expressed my protest by going through the corridor, saying whatever I wanted to say to whomever I wanted to say it. The secretaries, clerks, messengers and everybody heard it. So somebody along the line leaked this to the editor of Jet magazine, and it was published.
Naturally the officials blamed me for the leak. My superiors were enraged, but still they didn't know how to fire me without repercussions. Apparently, they agreed to give me the familiar old government practice of "silent treatment." They just simply refused to recognize me at all. They passed me by in the hall without looking at me, speaking to me or mumbling a single word. They refused to give me any assignment. If I initiated and presented a project to the director for approval or for suggestions, it was ignored entirely.
I began feeling very desolate, sitting in my room all alone day after day, with no work to do and nobody to talk to. I felt like a prisoner in solitary confinement. I started to resign. "I don't have to be subjected to this kind of treatment," I said to myself. Then on second thought I decided, "I will not resign. Why should I? That's exactly what they want me to do. They'd be getting rid of me the easy way. So I'm just going to sit here and draw my salary." I was getting a good salary, the best I had ever received, so why give it up? "If they don't want to give me any work, then I'll just sit here, do nothing, and draw my salary."
This leisure period lasted for several weeks before my immediate director called me into his office one day and informed me that the Council would soon be going through a reorganization period, that the funds were being cut, and the appropriation for my specific job had been terminated altogether, which meant that
* President's Committee on Equal Emplovment Opportunity﻿37
AAD: (cont.) my job would have to be abolished. Apparently he was expecting
some flak from me, but I expressed no protest. I only said, "Well, okay. That's fine." "What are you going to do about it?" he asked rather anxiously. "Nothing!" was my reply. "I'm going home to write my book—write the story of my life." That is how I came out of federal government and left the political scene.
After informing me of the termination of my job, this little second string supervisor ordered me to be off the job within the next three days. It was here that I protested. "No!" I emphasized. "I'm going to leave the job in due time, but certainly not within the next few days." I got in touch with the Civil Service Commission and inquired about the law in a situation such as this. They informed me to "sit tight" until I had an official notice from the CSC. I sat there for three more months before the official notice arrived, which gave me thirty days from the time the notice was received (four months in all). Because the job was abolished, the agency was forced to pay me a full year's severance pay. That is when I started to write my book. It took three years to write it, but at least I was receiving some income during the first year. This, I think, is one good example of discrimination in the federal government, but I can think of dozens of others I know about firsthand.
MMG: Do you want to say the name of the person who called you in to inform you that your job was no longer?
AAD: No, I think I'd better not. I could, but I	don't think I'm able to remember it.
MMG: Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to	comment on that's something that we've missed that should be discussed?
AAD: I think that brings it down to where I am today.
MMG: Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Dunnigan.﻿ALICE ALLISON DUNNIGAN
