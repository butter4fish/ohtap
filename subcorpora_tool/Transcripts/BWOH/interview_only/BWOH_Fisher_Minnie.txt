Dorothy Robinson:
Minnie Fisher:
I am in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, in the home of our interviewee, Mrs. Minnie Fisher. I am Dorothy R. Robinson. I have looked forward to meeting Mrs. Fisher for a period of some two years. We have carried on a correspondence, and we've carried on dialogue over the telephone, in an attempt to reach a time that was convenient for both of us. I was very anxious to interview this lady, because I had heard something about the many things in which she had been involved and I felt that the story of her life should certainly be recorded, that it might be a matter of information and inspiration to all people, and especially to black people.
Mrs. Fisher, I understand that you are a native of Mound Bayou, and that you're probably the oldest living citizen here now who is a native of this community. I wish you would share with us some information about your early childhood, your parents, and your grandparents. Anything that you can remember, anything that you heard about the early years, would you be kind enough to share with us?
My name is Minnie Lucinda Fisher, and I'm the daughter of Warren, the late Warren and Mary Elizabeth Fisher. I was born April 29, 1896, in the village of Mound Bayou, Mississippi. My parents were among the first group in Vicksburg, Mississippi, to be contacted by the Honorable Isaiah T. Montgomery when he made the historic decision to settle Mound Bayou as an all-Negro town. After making several trips here, from Vicksburg, he was able to get enough men to agree to follow him. It was not easy for these men to leave their homes, comfortable homes, and come to a wilderness to live. The land had to be cleared, huts or cabins had to be built, wild animals had to be destroyed. There was no comfort for them here, but they were determined to come and build a place for their children where﻿2
MF: (cont.) they could worship God and be educated. Now tell me if and when I go wrong.
DR: You're doing fine. Go right ahead.
MF: [laughs] In 1888, they returned to Vicksburg, and brou^it their families. My parents were among those who came at that time. They had already entered their land, and as now, we are right next to the Montgomerys. The trip was well spent... Next to the Montgomery land is the Fisher tract, known as the Minnie L. Fisher addition now, to the city of Mound Bayou. My parents had no children of their own, but they adopted a daughter of my mother's cousin, who had passed, and named her Mary Elizabeth Fisher. They brought her to Mound Bayou with them. In 1896 a baby girl was born to the proud parents, and named Minnie Lucinda Fisher. In 1900 death entered our family, and carried my mother from the family. In 1901 I lost my father, and I was left in the hands of my great-aunt and my adopted sister.
My early childhood was spent in the Mound Bayou Normal Institute, a school built and run by the American Missionary Association, and was in charge of Professor and Mrs. B.F. Ausley, who had spent a number of years as missionaries in Africa, where they had taught several years. They were devoted Christians, and taught the fear of God, and taught us to fear God, and how to keep His commandments. The lessons were learned well, because the punishment of being whipped was always over our heads. It was, it is with gratitude that I was able to be under their care at all times. I am grateful of them having a hand in seeing that I got the right direction in life.
After my great-aunt passed in 1912, I entered Tougaloo College, Tougaloo, Mississippi, and completed a four-year commercial course there. Having left Tougaloo College, I taught in the public school one year, of Bolivar County. And then I began my career as a servant of my people. I was taught that my parents wanted me to be able to serve my people. There were several of my parents' friends who helped to keep me...who helped to keep ever before me the things that my parents wanted me to do. And to carry on for Mound Bayou. There is just so much. My first job, after leaving Tougaloo College was clerk in the...
DR: ...city hall?
MF: No, it wasn't city hall. Mound Bayou express agent's building. And then after leaving him, I went to work for the Farmers' Cooperative Mercantile Company—the largest business in the town at that time. Pretty soon I decided to get married, and I married Will C. Collier, and moved to Leland, where I spent thirteen happy years. In 1933, I returned home, and farmed for several years. Then I went to work for Buffington, Taylor, and Company, in Memphis, and different other mercantile companies here in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. One was the Boos Mercantile Company, that I had a deal of dealings with the children where I had a deal... I had dealings with the oldest daughter of Isaiah T. Montgomery. She will be remembered as the daughter who, at this time... There is some of her relatives in Washington, her daughter in Washington. And at one﻿3
MF: (cont.) time, she was national Republican committeewoman from the city of Mound Bayou.
My next job was with the Knights and Daughters of Tabor, International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor, that built a Taborian Hospital, and it was for their members... The Honorable P.M. Smith, Chief Grand Master of the Knights and Daughter s of Tabor was happy when he was able to bring this hospital to meet the needs of his people in and around Mississippi. And not only in Mississippi, but all over the United States. I worked there for several years, in that hospital. And then the war came on us, and I decided to do something to help Uncle Sam. I left home and went to Detroit, Michigan, to work for the government as a clerk in the engineering and manufacturing department of the armed forces. There I remained until the war was over, and I returned home. I was then married to Frank Williams, who preceded me in death, and I was again in public life.
DR: Was that World War I or World War II?
MF: World War II, World War II.
DR: Mrs. Fisher, you mentioned the Ausleys as having something to do with your early education. Would you tell me if they were black or white people?
MF: The Ausleys were black. They were former slaves, down at Davis Bend, of Joe and Jeff Davis.
DR: Does that have something to do with Jeff Davis, who was the president of the South during the Civil War?
MF: He was the brother of Joe Davis, Joseph Davis. And of course, all of my people, my foreparents, were on that part of the plantation that Joseph Davis owned—they were brothers. And this Ausley was well educated. It so happened that also the Montgomerys, the ones who came here, they were born slaves. But they were edcated on this plantation down there—something that was not happening in the other part of the South. My mother was a student of Mr. Montgomery's sister...very, very intelligent woman. I remember her very much. So you see, we are a little ahead of a lot of the people who came from Davis Bend. They, their families were slaves. There was a connection between them and Joseph Davis... They even had a store...and that old man Montgomery served all of the folks on the plantation.
Not only that, but after the war, they bought...the Montgomerys bought the plantation. And naturally, after the government settled everything, the land was restored to those people who lost it... And Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, came back and took the land back, which left the Montgomerys out of a place. And in the end, they came here. Their highest hope was to build a Negro colony somewhere where he could get them all together again. Now that was his wish, and that's why, when the Y & MB railroad was built, running from Memphis to New Orleans, why they... All this was a wilderness, nothing here. But he came here, and he brought those men from Vicksburg with him. They had a hard time﻿4
MF: (cont.) living, but they stuck to it. And now we have this wonderful city of Mound Bayou.
DR: You are so correct in saying that it is a wonderful city. I did some
riding around yesterday afternoon. I have heard of Mound Bayou, I guess, all of my life as being an example of cooperative efforts of black people, and a symbol of their ambitions and their determinations, and what cooperation can do. And I'm so glad that you gave us that bit of background, because I was going to ask you anyway. Now I want to make sure I have this straight...that Isaiah T. Montgomery was inspired to settle and develop a black town, which developed into Mound Bayou, because some of his holdings had been taken from him after Jeff Davis came back at the end of the Civil War.
MF: At the end of the Civil War.
DR: That's interesting. And it's also interesting to note, though, that somebody in the Davis family saw to it that the slaves were educated. Is that correct?
MF: Oh yes, that's true, that's true. We have them all around here. And as I will show you...read you an article that Mr. Montgomery gave me when I reached womanhood... You spoke of, after my great-aunt died, how did I survive in Tougaloo College? It so happened that Mary Elizabeth Fisher and Warren Fisher left that forty-four acres of land for me. Not only that, but they had seen to it that they were members of all of those organizations back there that had money to put there, to see that I was educated. And after leaving school here and going to Tougaloo College, I had an administrator of my mother's estate—and I will say he was a wonderful white man to me. He saw to it that I had my food and that I had my clothes...my sister, my adopted sister had time to get my clothes ready for me. And my tuition was paid in the beginning of the year for the whole year down there, and I had nothing to worry about. Just stay down there and learn. And that I tried to do. [laughs]
DR: That is a very moving story... And it certainly sheds a new light on
what is sometimes considered the relationships between blacks and whites, because so often we think in terms of white people always exploiting black people. But that is not always true. It also shows a dichotomy there in that Jeff Davis withdrew from some of the black people their holdings, but there was some other good white person, just on the other end of spectrum, who tried to do what was right and fair by them. You were certainly a...you are a blessed person. And the thing that impresses me about you is that you are aware of the fact that you are a blessed person, and you have tried to show that by spilling it over into the lives of the persons whom you have touched. And the good Lord has blessed you with a long life to do that. You mentioned the fact that you taught school one year, and then you went to work for an express company. Can you tell us something about exactly what your duties were, on some of those jobs, just a brief...
MF: My duties in the express office was clerk. It so happened that the
express agent was a cousin of mine. And when I got out of school and said I wasn't going to teach anymore, he said, "Well, come into the office﻿5
MF: (cont.) and help me." That same fall, Mr. Montgomery and his son-in-law, Eugene P. Boos, did not have a bookkeeper in the Farmers' Cooperative Mercantile Company. And they came over and asked my cousin if he could let me come and take that job, because it was a bigger job than the one as clerk in the express office. And he readily agreed, he said, "Yes, I'd love to have her over there." The Montgomerys and the Joneses all came from down there in Mississippi. And the older people saw to it that I got a good beginning, and they sheltered me until I decided I wanted to get married, get somebody else to shelter me a while.
DR: Tell us something about your marriage to Mr. Collier. I think you
referred to it as thirteen years of happiness. I gather that he passed away. Do you want to, or will you be kind enough to tell us something about your married life to Mr. Collier, how did you meet him and that kind of thing.
MF: ^ It was through a friend of ours, from Greenville, that I met Mr. Collier. He was working then in the bank of Leland, as a runner for the people there in the bank...he had all of that, those kind of things to do. His father had worked for them a long time, and he was able to get work there. It was during my life in Leland that I learned a lot of things about other white people. Everybody wanted somebody to work for. I had never even said, "Good morning," too much to a white person, so that I didn't have any idea of working nowhere. In fact, I just knew that I wouldn't have it to do. That I had something else to do when I got out. So I said, "Well, I just don't like it down here. I'm happy here with you and everything."
But the depression came. And when the depression came, I lost money, because King Cotton had gone off. The second year after I married, the renter came to my house one Sunday morning, and said he wanted to talk with me. He said he'd lost everything, every nickel he had, up here in the bank. And he still had some cotton to sell, and he wanted to know what I could do to help him, to pull over as well as help myself. I told him I would see what I could do, and I would let him know the next day. But Monday morning banks had failed, all over the country. And what money I had up here, was there in that bank...the money that he had was there in that bank. And with the depression on, I found it necessary to do something myself to save what my parents had left me. So I came back to Mound Bayou. It was lucky for me that Mr. Montgomery was still living, and was able to help me do some of the things to save everything that I had.
DR: Did you ever work as a domestic in a white family at all?
MF: Never, never.
DR: Were you ever asked to work?
MF: I was asked to work. One -morning I was on my way to thepost office to
mail my letters, and one of the ladies walked to the gate and said, "Who are you?" I said, "I'm Minnie L. Fisher." "Where do you work?" I say, "I'm not working yet. I'm still in college." "You are in college?" I﻿6
MF: (cont.) said, "Yes, I am." "Well, what are you doing in Cleveland?" I said, "My sister is working for Lawyer and Mrs. Owens. And I stay awhile with her every year, and then I got back to school." She said, "Well, I need somebody to help me, and I'm going to call Mrs. Owens and see about it." So, she found out that I was telling her the truth. But my sister said, "Well, don't go up to that post office no more in the morning by her house. I'm sending you on back to Mound Bayou to Cousin Mary and Cousin Nelson. You stay there, I'll fix your clothes, get everything ready, until it's time for you to go back to Tougaloo. Because I don't want any trouble." [laughs]
DR: A very interesting commentary. How did your husband fare during the
depression? Did he lose his job at the bank, and if so, what did he do about further employment?
MF: He did not lose his job at the bank...he had been with those people ever since he was small. And they saw to it that he had something to do. But I couldn't lose what my parents had...I just couldn't do it, I couldn't lose what my parents had left me. And I was just willing to come home, go to work, and save every bit of it. And I still own it today.
DR: That is marvelous. And did you folks separate, or did he pass?
MF: He finally passed, down there.
DR: Thank you. I want to go back to even earlier years, when you were, say,
nine, ten, eleven. What sort of entertainment did you have as a youngster here in Mound Bayou, what sort of games did the kids play? Where there other black youngsters with whom you were associated? And did you think— as you look back now—do you think of your childhood as having been a relatively happy one? I gather you never knew want and hunger and that kind of thing, like many kids did.
MF: No, I didn't. But it was a happy, it was a happy one...my childhood was a happy one. We had other children to play with—and when you said, what kind of games we played, just a day or two ago I saw an article that I had written, how we played dropping handkerchief. And how we played other ring plays around. And I laughed, and then yesterday, when the kids from New York were here to see me, my family folks, I told them, I said, "I'm going to tell you an interesting thing." I said, "My nose has been itching all the week. And your grandparents have said that company was coming to the house to see you." I said to them, "Ooh, thank you, nose, they are all here." [laughs] And one of my cousins, he said, "Cousin Minnie," he said, "you don't mean it." He said, "Well, what did the rooster do?" I said, "No rooster now, but the rooster used to crow on the front porch, and that was a sign." I said, "I don't know how you all children are getting along now, with no signs to carry you through life." [laughs]
DR: That's an interesting observation, too, because many of the younger people just simply don't realize many of the superstitions and whatnot that were believed years ago. I believe you mentioned a second marriage. Do you want to comment on that marriage, how you met the Mr.—was it Williams?﻿7
MF: Williams.
DR: And how long that marriage lasted, and that kind of thing.
MF: That marriage... I met him here. I had a visit from my nieces and nephews by that marriage on yesterday. Some were from New York, some was from Los Angeles, some were from Memphis, Tennessee. We, that marriage went on the rocks, and I kept my correspondence with the family, and they are very dear and near... they're near and dear to me. And it's always "Aunt Minnie" this and "Aunt Minnie" that. They come regular to see me. They were here with me on the Minnie Fisher Day, and I was very happy to have them a part of the family.
DR: Thank you very much. Now you mentioned the Minnie Fisher Day, and
you passed me a program a few minutes ago. I wish every one who will ever read the transcript of this tape could see this program. Will you describe that occasion for us, and tell us how it all came about— who was involved, how you felt, and all that kind of thing. It must have been a very impressive occasion.
MF: I am a member of the Mound Bayou Civic Circle. And a few years ago, a number of our friends decided to organize another civic club—the name was the Mound Bayou Civic Improvement Society, Incorporated. And last year, they came to me and said, "We want to ask you to let us do something." I said, "What is that?" They said, "Well, we want to give you a day all your own, the Minnie Fisher Day. See, we understand that you are the oldest one living who was born here at that time, when the town was early, and it was nothing but in a wilderness and away." I finally said, "Well, I don't know whether I can live up to that." I said, "Old age is creeping up on me, and I might not be able to stand that." Said, "Oh, yes you will. Come on, we're going to do it." So, on April 21, 1979, they presented the Minnie Fisher Day, Mound Bayou's oldest living native-born citizen. It was at two o'clock...the house was packed; we had a wonderful time that day. The parade was beautiful, the band, from the school, led the parade... And then we had the mayor, my mayor, and my board of aldermen with me, right at my side. The pastor of my church and his wife were with me—and by the way, he was my escort down the aisle. He's a very, very dear pastor, and his wife is a very dear friend of mine.
DR: What's their name?
MF: Reverend and Mrs. L.J. Jordan, Jr., Greenville, Mississippi. This
program will long be remembered by everybody who witnessed it. They sent notices all over the country, to all of my friends in the North and South, East and West. A lot of my classmates and friends from Tougaloo College sent in greetings for me. The president of Tougaloo College, now, although he was a boy when I was there, I have a communication from him, in memory of Tougaloo College.﻿8
Tougaloo College April 2, 1979
Miss Minnie L. Fisher Mound Bayou, Mississippi
Dear Miss Fisher,
I'm privileged to write you this letter of congratulations on behalf of your alma mater, on the occasion of the celebration of Minnie L. Fisher Day, by the Mound Bayou Civic Improvement Society, Incorporated. Your long career and service to the citizens of Mound Bayou has brought honor to the city and to your alma mater. Your selfless dedication to the uplift and progress of your people have won the admiration and gratitude of all who know you. The lives that you have touched will continue your great tradition of service in continuing gratitude and thanksgiving to you. I commend the Mound Bayou Civic Improvement Society, Incorporated, for recognizing one so deserving as yourself. The students, faculty, administration, trustees and alumni of Tougaloo College join me in a great salute to you, and want you to know that you will always have our best wishes and prayers.
George A. Owens, President
DR: A beautiful expression, and certainly a deserving one. I notice
the pictures that you had made of the occasion, and it seems to me that gifts and flowers were very much in order as well as the presence of your many friends and congratulatory messages. How did you really feel about this occasion?
MF: Well, the... I don't know. The more tributes that came, the more I wanted to squeal. And I just had to hold myself down. The one coming from the mayor and board of aldermen, that I had served these eighteen years, was something that just touched my heart. I tried to do my very best, and sometimes when you do your very best, others will say that you haven't done anything. But when I got the number of cards and things from the staff that I had been over for eighteen years, and everything said, "Miss Minnie, we love you." "Miss Min, we love you. This is your day." "Miss Min, the whole city staff, we love you." And then when the mayor, who is a young man, very young man, and one that I helped to put in office, over a period of years, came to the rostrum and said, "I want to read this for you, Miss Min." He said,
Dear Miss Fisher,
On behalf of the mayor, board of aldermen, and municipal employees, I take the great pleasure and pride in writing this congratulatory message to you. Mound Bayou is truly blessed and proud to have you, one of the first-born native children in its wilderness days. Today, even greater is﻿9
Mound Bayou's glory because of your active participation in all of its affairs. Through the years of struggle, you've continued to work with unselfish dedication in an effort to see that the dream of the great founding fathers remained alive. As some expect, your work has been confined to eighteen years of loyal and competent service to the citizens of Mound Bayou through your initial and official capacity as city clerk, and later as clerk and tax collector. You've given of your time and talent in numerous affairs, morally, religiously, culturally, educationally, socially, and we thank you for it. We know truly no worthier person could have been chosen to receive the honors that have been bestowed upon you today. The Mound Bayou Civic Improvement Club deserves praise for having selected such a noteworthy individual in honor at this time. Because you have given so much of yourself to this community and the people, we take this method to say thank you and to salute you on this day, your day. May God grant you health and strength to continue in the work that you began so long ago. Mound Bayou needs you and others like you.
Yours truly, Earl S. Lucas Mayor,
City of Mound Bayou
DR: Another very beautiful expression. Do you serve now as tax assessor and collector?
MF: I am still on the payroll, [laughs]
DR: Well, I'm sure they couldn't have a more competent person on the payroll.
Let me ask you this. You've traveled a great deal over the United States, and certainly you know black people, and you've worked with black groups all over. Do you find that there is a greater pride, a sort of black pride that exists in Mound Bayou, that you do not find in other sections of the country? Would you react to that please?
MF: We really have pride. We think... I guess we think ourselves something even those, some of those who are richer than we are. There's a heritage behind us... And that heritage keeps our heads up. No matter what happened, I said, "Keep your chin up. Just keep your chin up."
DR: Thank you very much. Let me ask you something more about Mound Bayou, that is, the present Mound Bayou. I'd like to know about what the population is here, and tell us something about the industries. As I look at the houses and the businesses... the business houses, the business establishments...it doesn't look like a poverty-ridden community. And I'd like to know what do the people do for incomes. Would you tell us the population and something about the kinds of work that the people here do?
MF: The population is between three and four thousand now. We have part of
the city that has not been officially brought into the city yet, but will be in a few months. And that part, I know, will give us something like﻿10
MF: (cont.) five thousand people. But as it is now, it is between three and four thousand. The mayor that we have now has seen to it that some industry has been brought into the town, and that whatever the government has to give other people, he sees to it that we get some of it.
DR: About what is your scholastic population? How many kids are in school? And I believe you have both a Catholic school and a public school, if I'm right. Comment on that, please.
MF: We have a Catholic school, and we've had one for quite a number of years, because there was always a lot of Catholics around in this territory. The school...we have what is known as the I.T. Montgomery Elementary School. And then we have a high school Now in the high school, we have over five hundred children. We have a government project that's coming up right now, and we're going to give those children something to do. I don't know the exact number of children at the elementary school, but it is quite a number. And the Catholics have any number down there, because they not only help in the school life here, but other places, like Cleveland, and even some cities as far as Clarksdale have some children here in the school.
DR: Why is that, that the children, some children come from Cleveland, and some come from Clarksdale? Why do they come here? Is it that they feel there is better training being offered here? What's the story there?
MF: Well, some of their parents were former teachers down there at the Catholic school. And they bring their children, and take them to the Catholic school down there. A lot of our children now...we are everywhere now in the colleges, Cleveland and everywhere else. As fast as they get out from here, we send them on away. The only thing we are trying to do now is to have something for them to do when they get out of school.
DR: Do you have any white children in the school here?
MF: I don't...unless it's a doctor. We have some white doctors in our
hospitals and in our clinics. And their children, little small children, they go. And then we have Head Start, which is a government project. And they, if they are here, they go to school.
DR: Thank you. Are there any white residents within the corporate limits of Mound Bayou?
MF: No white residents.
DR: Have there ever been any here, to your knowledge?
MF: Not in the corporate limits.
DR: Have they tried to come in? Have they shown any interest? What's the background of that? It wasn't that you wouldn't let them in, is it?
MF: Well, I don't know, [laughs] But we haven't, we have stayed to ourselves. We have a white town on the north end of us, Shelby. And by the way, they have a Negro mayor now.﻿11
DR: Wonderful.
MF: And we have a white town just below us, Merigold. They have never
tried to bring their children to school here. We've had Negro children from Merigold to come here for school, even in my little school days. And we have tried to live peaceable. Things might turn up sometimes, but they smooth over.
DR: But for the most part, you do have good relationships with the surrounding communities?
MF: Yes, good...with the surrounding communities.
DR: Do hlack children attend school at Shelby and at Merigold, so far as you know?
MF: " They have their own schools.
DR: When you say they have their own schools, you mean there are schools for blacks and schools for whites?
MF: And for whites.
DR: In Shelby, perhaps, and in Merigold. So far as you know, the federal government hasn't said or done anything about it?
MF: No, we don't worry about it. [laughs]
DR: You still have black teachers in those black schools?
MF: Yes, and white teachers, too, in the...
DR: Well, do you know if you have any black teachers in the predominantly white schools there, do you know?
MF: I don't know that. But we stay...they stay and we stay on the inside of the law. See...
DR: Good.[laughter] Well now, you mentioned the presence of doctors in your hospital. I was very much impressed with the building, the plant of the hospital that I passed yesterday. And then, driving out, I saw something else, called the health center, I believe.
MF: Yes, it is.
DR: Is that another hospital, or is it a nursing home, or what is that? The health center.
MF: It is a health center. It is under the government control, too. And the health center and the...it is not the Taborian Hospital now. It's the Mound Bayou Hospital, and it's under government control. You see, we have white and black...
[break]﻿12
DR: Mrs. Fisher, you know, something that impressed me so much yesterday as I was driving around...I gathered that some of the new houses and maybe the hospital, and that kind of thing, might have been made available through some assistance with federal monies. But I thought to myself, "The community had to have some real leadership and somebody who was knowlegeable of help that was available from the federal government, and somebody who had enough concern to busy oneself to get it." And I thought that was just very commendable about Mound Bayou. I was also impressed with your churches. I saw several churches, and some of them were very imposing structures. Would you comment on the churches in Mound Bayou and that kind of thing?
MF: If you went north, there is one large brick church up there. That
happens to be my church, where I was born, when my mother was a member of the Brush Arbor [Church]. And she was on the mothers' board for a number of years before she passed. At this particular time now, I have been serving on the mothers' board of this new church for about eighteen years or more. We have everything there that is needed for the children, the educational rooms, the baptismal room, and everything. You would be happy to see what is on the inside of it..
DR: I'm sure I would, because the structure that I saw is a far cry from a brush arbor... And it's just a blessing to this community that you are still here and that you maintain some allegiance to that old Brush Arbor, and the fact that your mother was a mother of the church and all. About how many churches are in Mound Bayou, and could you tell us... I think I saw a C.M.E. or an A.M.E., and I belive one or two Baptist churches. And there must be Catholics. Do you have some other denominations represented?
MF: We have, after the Baptists, the first church...then we have the A.M.E. church on the highway... And at one time, they wereall members of the First Baptist Church. We laugh about it, because at that time, they all worshipped together, and they had their holy communion together. And when they were able, they built churches of their own. The A.M.E. church is right on the highway, as you go up. And on the...we have a C.M.E. church also. And then, we have an Apostolic church here. We're wonderfully blessed with churches—any denomination you want to attend, you can get there, you see. And you see a wonderful church built on the. if you went far enough, if you go far enough up on the highway, on the right-hand side. Then over on the left-hand side, we have a building that the Baptists in Bolivar County built. It is beautiful on the inside
DR: What is...is that just an ordinary church building, or is it a district auditorium or something? That Bolivar County Baptist Church?
MF: Oh, it's a county affair. It is supported.
DR: Like they hold associations...
MF: Yes, associations. And at one time, they allowed it to be used for Head Start, until we could get our building. Now we have a beautiful building... The mayor has seen to it that...﻿13
DR: I saw a building with a sign that said "Head Start."
MF: Head Start.
DR: With such close cooperation among the different denominations, it seems that religion is a great influence in this community, [break] Could you comment on crime here at Mound Bayou? How do you think it compares with crime elsewhere?
MF: Well, we don't have too much of it. But now and then, we have something that will flare up, and it'll make our hearts bleed. But in the end it's all over with, and... One thing I think about the crime here, you know, now juveniles are not punished for a lot of things they do. And they, we haven't just had too much of it. Now and then, we have something to happen, but not too often.
DR:: How do you feel about the punishment of criminals? Do you think we are too lenient or too rigid across the board in dealing with criminals, or people who commit crimes?
MF: Well, I think, in a way, most of the crimes, we are rather lenient with it..! The government has to take care of that, and I know they will. And when I see things go wrong, and look like it should have been another way, I say, "Oh well, it's nothing we can do about it right now."
DR: You've been here a long while in this all-black community. Do you feel the need of white citizens here, or do you think things would be different in a better way if we had white citizens? Or do you think we're doing very well as all blacks?
MF: I think we're doing very well. And why I say that...because we've had a lot of whites to come in and want to know how we do things.
DR: Yes, I think you're really in the national eye. I think a lot of people would like to know what happens in Mound Bayou [laughter] And I suspect that that's one of the purposes of this interview. Tell me this. You have mentioned the churches, you've mentioned your work at the city hall and all, what are some of the other organizations with which you are connected? I think you mentioned Heroines of Jericho—you have a meeting this afternoon.
MF: Yes, I sure do.
DR: What other organizations are you involved with, or have been involved with?
MF: I have, and I am still involved with the Eastern Star Grand Chapter and the Knights and Daughters of Tabor. And as I said, I have been a member of the Knights and Daughters of Tabor from a kid on up, and it's been over sixty-five years with them. Now with that organization, I am still serving in two or three departments with them. And at one time I was the International Chief Grand Recorder of the Knights and Daughters of Tabor... and we have a beautiful relationship.
DR: And I believe that organization started your first hospital here.﻿14
MF: Yeah, they built that first hospital.
DR: And the present hospital is really an outgrowth of the organization of the Knights and...
MF: ...Daughters of Tabor. That's ours.
DR: That's a very beautiful thing. And it's certainly served a purpose, I know.
MF: Oh yes, it's served a purpose.
DR: Because health conditions for black people throughout the nation leaves a lot to be desired.
MF: And see, in '42 you had to go around to back doors and wait, and sometimes die before anybody could get there to attend to you. And we put that there and we were so happy, you see.
DR: I know you were. Tell me, have you felt that being black or being a woman has hampered your activities in any way?
MF: Not mine. A lot of people seem to feel so, but as I told you, from the time that I was a little tot, and I had to go to Cleveland to get my money sometimes... They'd put me on the train here and send me down there. And my administrator had a man, Negro man, at the train to get me and meet me, bring me on, get my check, bring me back... I just haven't had too much...
DR: You've missed a lot of unpleasant things that a lot of people haven't.
MF: That a lot of people haven't.
DR: You feel, then, really, that you've been sheltered somewhat more than the average black woman.
MF: Than the average black woman. And you take, in my work as clerk and
tax collector, I have, I've had a wonderful relationship with the people in Cleveland.
DR: What do you think about the women's movement today? Do you think we need to be more liberalized, or do you think we just need to make use of what we have? Are you a women's libber, or how would you identify yourself in that area?
MF: Well, I go 'long, [laughs] I'm not, I don't raise a whole lot of fuss about it. I've been with the national group for years, and we've done a lot of good things together. And I think we ought to have a certain amount of connections to...[break]
DR: Mrs. Fisher, what do you consider your most significant achievement in
life? You've done many things, and you've achieved many things. But if you had to pick out one thing that stands out in your mind as the most﻿15
DR: (cont.) important thing you've ever done, or the most important thing you've ever been involved with, tell me what it was.
MF: One of the things that I think that I've been involved with that I've
loved most and have given more time, now...is children. I have...I did not have children of my own. And ever since I have been grown, I have dedicated my life to helping some child who did not have the opportunities that I had. And the bread has come back on the water, to me, for those things. Now, you, when you see most of the folks around here, they'll tell you that Mound Bayou belongs to me, and I belong to them.
DR: That's a beautiful way of putting it.
MF: I'm dedicated.
DR: Do you belong to any sororities?
MF: No, no, no.
DR: Tell me about some awards that have come your way. I know you've already told us about the Minnie Fisher Day. Have there been some other honors or awards that you received along the way?
MF: It was in, I have the date here for you. In 1975, under the leadership of Mayor Earl S. Lucas, the Mound Bayou Community Center, a government project, was dedicated on Sunday...1975. During this program, fifty units of the Mound Bayou Public Housing Authority was dedicated in honor of Mrs. Fisher by Cornelius Love. On Saturday, after that, Mound Bayou Civic Improvement Club began their record to make the Mound Bayou, the Minnie L. Fisher Day true. But what I wanted to tell you is that that unit out there was dedicated to me in 19 and 75, and we had a lovely time. They had a big program and everything there. And then, they came along and this was Senior Spotlights that they were giving. And Mrs. Searcy down at Cleveland came up to talk with me. She said, "Now, I worked with you a long time in the Parent-Teachers' Association in the county and in the state. And I want to spotlight you today with this." And she said, "This person whom we come in contact with is made up of a lot of things that are worthy to be acknowledged. You might not think it when you see her, that she's the age she is. But she has kept up her fellowship and her good feeling with everybody that she has come in contact with, and she is food for those who come after her. Our spotlight is a worthy senior at this time. She was born April 29, 18 and 96, in Mound Bayou. Her parents were the late Warren and Mary Elizabeth Fisher, and they were among the first settlers to be consulted by the Honorable Isaiah T. Montgomery when he envisioned the historic decision to develop Mound Bayou, an all-Negro colony in 18 and 87. She received her education at the Mound Bayou Normal Institute, and then went on to Tougaloo College, where she had four years of commercial work. She's a member of the First Baptist Church of Mound Bayou, and she has been a dedicated church worker there. She's presently acting as Sunday school teacher, assistant church clerk, and secretary of the Greater Bolivar Baptist Women's Association. During the war she went to Detroit and served her country, in that department. She has served as instructor in the public school of Bolivar County; clerk, bookkeeper in Farmers' Cooperative Mercantile Company; clerk and﻿16
MF: (cont.) bookkeeper of the Taborian Hospital, the Mound Bayou Hospital now; International Grand Recorder in the International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor. Aside from serving on a lot of other things that she has done in Bolivar Country, she is active, serving with her local and state Parent-Teachers' Association and city librarian. In case some of you might not realize the age of this remarkable woman," at that time I was eighty-one, "she seems to be in good health, and has a fine good communication with young people, as well as older people. She is generally employed as clerk and tax collector of the city of Mound Bayou, where she has been serving for years. When I asked her about her hobbies, she said, 'Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.' It is a pleasure to know the individual and to have an opportunity to spotlight her."
DR: That is another beautiful testimony to your many years of involvement. I was going to ask you about hobbies, but I guess that just about sums it up. "Early to bed, early to rise." [laughter] You don't fish, or do handwork, or work in the yard, or anything of that sort?
MF: No.
DR: You're too busy doing the more meaningful things.
MF: I get other folks to do that, [laughter] And then I can't fish. It's too, too slow...too slow for me. I sell the fishing license, but the fishing is too slow.
DR: That's interesting. Well, tell me, you've mentioned your living in Memphis a while, and then in Detroit. Have you traveled otherwise throughout the United States, or out of the United States?
MF: I have never gone out of the United States. But my work with the Baptist people in their work, in their boards, different boards, and with the Sunday school and BTU [Baptist Teachers Union] Congress and things— we have gone over quite a bit of the United States. As one of my members said when she was on the program on Minnie Fisher Day, she said, "We have put our toes in the Atlantic and the Pacific, all to see, and try to learn something to come back and give our children, that they might be better off."
DR: And I suppose that spells out for us to some degree why Mound Bayou is Mound Bayou. Because you've brought back into the community bits of information and inspiration from elsewhere. Mrs. Fisher, you've been a single woman much of your life. What is your attitude about marriage? It seems that so many marriages are going on the rocks nowadays. Why is it you think we have so many divorces, and what do you think about something that seems to be a trend in our days, that men and women just have each other for roommates without the benefit of a marriage ceremony? How do you feel about those things?
MF: Well, I have nothing to say about the young folks who decide to live
together without being married. It was not my bringing up to do things like that. You got married. You...it was just out of the question for﻿17
MF: (cont.) you to live together. I had a young friend who told me, "Well, you see, Mrs. Fisher, you married and you lost your husband, and then, the last one you divorced, you said there were things that you didn't like." I said, "Well, here's the thing about it. I wanted to do certain things. I had a calling to do certain things." And I said, "I've always..." I said, "Now I don't brag about it, but I've always had some money. And I spent it for what I wanted to spend it for. Nobody's had any boss over it or anything." I say, "You know you always go along with your husband on some things." I said, "But I think it would be nice if you would get married." I said, "I'd love to have grandchildren, and they could say, 'This is my grandmother and my grandfather, this is my great-grandmother and my great-grandfather."' I said, "It's lovely for me to even go back to the time when my grandparents and great-grandparents were slaves, and get those names together, and say that this is my roots." I say, "Now, you can't talk about roots, 'cause you didn't have any."
DR: Now, in the same connection, that brings to my mind the fact that there
is an increase in illegitimate births. Now do you feel about that, or do you care to comment on that?
MF: Well yes, there are a number of illegitimate births. But I still say,
where I'm concerned, I'd do everything I can to get young folks married. If they will marry after these children are born—give those children a name. I've never liked the idea that you had to go in your grandparents' name when you had a daddy.
DR: Thank you. I want to ask you another question that's very personal, but I do wish we could get your reaction to it. Now, you are a beautiful chocolate brown, a very beautiful lady, and nobody would think you were your age. If you were so inclined, you could lop off about twenty years and nobody would argue about it. Have you felt that your color has placed you at a disadvantage as it would relate to a Negro who was of lighter skin? Have you ever let that bother you, or has it in any way impeded any of your progress, or made you feel any less capable? Please comment on that for us.
MF: I have never felt anything about color. I do my job, and I want to do the best job it is in the bunch. Color hasn't made any big stride with me, I just go on. I've had colored friends, some that were so white you couldn't tell them. I never had...Inever felt inferior along those lines. I get out, and we do the job together. And if it's white, when we got a job to do, we do it. And I've had a chance to do quite a bit of that since I've been working in the tax collector's office, things like that. We go down, we sit down together, and we discuss things—and it's no funny feelings whatever.
DR: What do you think is the greatest challenge facing black people today? What is it you think we need to be doing that we are not doing, or what areas do you feel we need to stress more and focus on more, in order to improve our plight as black people?
MF: Well, we need to decide what we want to do and do it. That's the main thing. As black folks, we need to decide that if whites can do this, I can do it.﻿18
DR: Wonderful. But do you think our salvation lies in economic progress... do we need money more than education, education more than money—do we need them both?
MF: We need both of them. We need the education first, and then we need money to do the things that we see we would like to do.
DR: What do you think about the present home? Do you think the average
youngster is getting the wholesome kind of counseling and guidance in the home that they got a generation ago?
MF: They don't get it, because their parents don't have time to give it to
them. My parents and others, they stayed home; their mothers were home, they nursed the children themselves, they took care of them. And the man got out and made the money. But now the mother has to—there are so many children there, she has to be out making money too. And then that leaves her children to not get the teaching that they would get if the mother were are home.
DR: Do you think the church is doing all that it might do to sort of supplement what the home is no longer able to do?
MF: Well, in my church, we are doing what we can. We have a lot of members
who are not able to do certain things for their children. And then, too, you must remember that where you could get along on ten dollars thirty years ago, you can't get along on nothing, now. Everything is sky high. And it means that somebody has to raise some money to keep that family together.
DR: What are some of the things your church is doing? What are some of the organizations, auxiliaries, that you have to interest and train young people in your particular church?
MF: Well, in my particular church, we have the training there. We got a training school there among them, and we have classes that go all out to teach them different things, and we have wonderful things. You think, now, we have a bus ministry at my church. And they send out once or twice every week and bring children in, and train them to sing, and to recite, like that. And they are doing a lot, my church in particular, to help parents with their children now.
DR: I think you've mentioned the fact that you have a rather good rapport with the young people in the community. You haven't felt the generation gap, then, that many people talk about? As it relates to you as an individual?
MF: Not as it relates to me, because you... I can just walk down the street and, "Hi, Mrs. Min." "What you doing, Mrs. Min?" "Where you going, Mrs. Min?" If the car door's open, "Do you want to get out? Want me to help you out, or you want me to shut the door?" I have a good communication with them.
DR: That's marvelous. If you had to give a bit of, sort of, blanket advice to young blacks today, what would you tell them?﻿19
MF: Get their education. Get something upstairs. That's your only salvation.
DR: Where do most of the youngsters here go to college? Do they still go to Tougaloo? Do they go out of the state, or just what happens?
MF: A lot of them go out of	the state. They go to Tougaloo, they	go	to
Jackson College, and we	have several colleges now in...around	in	the
areas, different areas,	and then they leave there and they go	to	the colleges in the North.
DR: And some of your youngsters go to what have been predominantly white colleges here in Mississippi?
MF: Yes, they have gone. We've got lawyers and doctors turning out every
year now from the white colleges in Mississippi. See, we are staying in order, [laughs]
DR: And some of those young people come back here to serve, once they've completed their training.
MF: Oh yes, they are nursing and everything. They are right back in those hospitals.
DR: What do you see as the future for Mound Bayou? What do you think it will be like ten years from now?
MF: Well, I don't know. But if my mayor lives long enough it'll be a city right. I just don't want him to pass.
DR:	Well, he's still a young man.
MF:	Yes, he's still a young man.
DR:	And he has the general support of the community to have served more than one term.
MF:	Oh yes. This is his third term.
DR:	Well, that speaks well for Mound Bayou.
MF:	And he has a lovely family, a wife and a lovely group of children.
DR: That's interesting. Mrs. Fisher, you have perhaps the most complete set of notes and scrapbooks I think that I've ever seen. What are your plans for these very important materials after you have passed away? What do you plan to do with them or what would you like to see done with them?
MF: Well, I plan to see that the... Over there at the city hall, we have a place there now that we are going to use to store all of the records and things about Mound Bayou. And I hope someday that it'll be there for the children to go and see.﻿20
DR: Aren't you working on a history of Mound Bayou?
MF: Right now.
DR: Tell me about it. How far along are you, who's been giving you material outside of your own resources here?
MF: Well, we are going to get our material from those who are around. See, I happen to know all of those who are left from the early settlers and their children. And I plan to use those children to go from house to house, sit down with those people that I recommend them to go to, and get their life history. We were supposed to have started in September, but we had a little trouble. The money has been allowed from Washington, and we will be getting on with it.
DR: Let me refer again to federal monies. Who are the moving spirits here that have been able to get federal grants when so many communities say they can't get it? How have you been...
MF:	Mayor Earl S. Lucas, [laughs]
DR:	That answers a lot, doesn't it.
MF:	That he...answers a lot.
DR:	But my guess is, you have provided a great deal of inspiration to him.
MF: Oh yes, because when...if there's anything, he finds Mrs. Min. "Mrs. Min, now look. What about so and so and so and so?"
DR: Well, I certainly hope that I'll be able, that I'll be around and I can get a copy of Mound Bayou history once you folks have completed it.
MF: Well, we're working on it now. We're working on it.
DR: Mrs. Fisher, this has been one of the most interesting interviews it has been mine to conduct. And as I said in the beginning, I had looked forward to meeting you, and had looked forward to this interview, because I knew you had a very rich background, a rich heritage, and I felt that all of the United States would have been impoverished had we not had something of your life and your works in a permanent record. One other thing, before you close this interview. You have been married twice, but you still use the name Fisher, and that's your maiden name.
MF: That's my maiden name. And when I divorced the last husband, I told the judge, "Give me the name of the man who my mother said was my father." [laughter]
DR: This is interesting. You still have some of the property that your parents left you, is that correct?
MF: I still have it. I have it. I'm sitting on some of it right now.﻿21
DR: That is extremely interesting.
MF: ...very, very happy to have been able to get with the young lady
this morning and do this interview. She has tried a long time to pin me down, but I was running this way and that way, and she was going the other way. And finally, I just said, "Well, I'm going to stop and try to do it." I'm happy to do it. I'm always happy to let people know something about Hound Bayou, because this is home to me. I was born here, reared here, and I'm still here. Thanks a lot for having her to come and interview me. We will always remember her.
DR: On behalf of the persons involved with the Black Women Oral History Project and Schlesinger Library, we want to thank you, Mrs. Minnie L. Fisher.﻿MINNIE L. FISHER
