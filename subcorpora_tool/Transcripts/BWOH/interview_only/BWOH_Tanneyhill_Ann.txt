Cheryl Gilkes:	Miss Tanneyhill, could you please tell about
yourself?
Ann Tanneyhill:	Well, I guess the logical place to begin is
the date I was born, which was January 19, 1906, which makes me a Capricornian, if that means anything. Although my parents lived in Norwood, Massachusetts, I was born in New England Hospital for Women and Children because there was no hospital in Norwood and no midwife there. I think one's family background and early environment has a lot to do with where one ends up, so perhaps something about my own family background would be interesting.
My father was born in Frederick, Maryland, in 1863. Of course, that's the home of Barbara Frietschie,the heroine of John Greenleaf Whittier's poem by that name. He was the son of Aaron and Elizabeth Weems Tanneyhill. My middle name, Elizabeth, came from my paternal grandmother. I have always intended to look into my father's family. All I know was that his father was what was called "keeper of the courthouse" in Frederick, Maryland. Now I suppose in simple parlance, since he was black, that probably meant janitor, but at least he had this very high sounding title. And I've seen a picture of my paternal grandfather, and he has high cheekbones and looks Indian. So I do intend to trace my father's family.
Now my father came from Frederick to Walpole, Massachusetts, which is a town about four miles from Norwood. He followed the Diggs family there, and the Diggs family, as you'll hear about a little later, bears some relation to my family. The Diggs family moved from Walpole to Norwood, Massachusetts. Norwood is a small town—of course it's much larger now—but the main industries were printing and leather, the tanning of leather. My father came there and became the coachman and butler, coachman because there were horses in those days. This was about, in the late 1880s—I would believe 1888, from some of the documents I have at home. He became coachman and butler for Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Day.﻿2
AT: Mrs. Day's name was Anna Maria Smith. My first name, Anna, was given
because of Mrs. Day. So my name, Anna Elizabeth, comes from my paternal grandmother and from the matriarch of the family for which my father worked. And that family had a great deal of influence in my own personal life.
My mother was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her name was Adelaide Grandison. Her father, William Grandison, was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. His parents came to Halifax from, I believe, Louisiana, on the underground railroad. My grandfather was reputedly—and I say reputedly because these are among the things that I intend to trace a little bit more—the first black to go to Dalhousie College in Halifax. Dalhousie College, I believe, was probably really a prep school. When he was in Halifax, he learned the printer's trade, and he came to Cambridge. And here again, I don't know the exact date, but he came to Cambridge because a white friend of his from Halifax induced him to come down here. He was apprenticed, and his friend wanted him to work with him at the Riverside Press in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Well, there was a union at the Riverside Press and they had never had a colored—I use the word "colored" because I'm using the terms that were used in that day... they had never had a colored man working there at the Riverside Press. My grandfather would tell the story, I remember as a teenager hearing him tell the story, and it is published in the Boston Globe, June 11, 1905. For some reason or other, they went back and did the story. In the winter of 1870-71, the union had a meeting one night to decide whether they would let Mr. William Grandison become a member of the union. He came to the meeting and was told to sit outside the meeting room, and they stayed up all night, arguing as to whether or not to let this man in. And finally in the morning he was admitted. He is reputed to be the first black person to be admitted to a trade union in the United States. Now this may or may not be true, but at least he was among the first of the black trade unionists in the country. This story my grandfather used to tell was in the back of my mind as I was growing up. He taught my mother how to set type, so after he left the Riverside Press, he came to Norwood and worked for J.S. Cushing, the printing firm in Norwood. And my mother who was always my motivation, became a typesetter for J.S. Cushing.
My mother had a sister who was a little younger than she, so here we have in Norwood my father who came from Frederick, Maryland; the Diggs family who came from Frederick, Maryland; the Grandisons who came from Cambridge to Norwood. There were no other black people in this small town. The population was then about seven thousand. So, of course, these two black families became friends and it ended up that one of the Diggs young men asked my mother to marry him and she said no. He asked her sister to marry him, and she said yes. They married. Then my father and mother married, so the Diggses are our cousins. And we were the only two black families in that town. I don't think another black family came into that town until about 1935. I had two brothers and a sister. One brother was older than I. Then I came along, then my younger brother, and then my sister, who was the youngest of all.﻿3
CG: What are their names?
AT: My older brother was named Clayton. My younger brother was named William. And my sister was named Gertrude. I suppose it's difficult for a black person born and brought up in the South or who has stayed in a segregated environment all his or her life to comprehend what it's like growing up as a child in a small New England town with no other blacks except your cousins around. And people cannot seem to understand when I say—I don't say it any more—that I did not know, I did not realize that I was different from anybody else until I was about thirteen years old. We—my brothers, my cousins, we played together, but we played with the other children, went to school with the other children. We went to church, we went to the movies, did all the things kids do. I had a very happy childhood—holidays, Christmas, Thanksgiving, just normal holidays. And it wasn't until I was thirteen years old one day that one of the girls I played with called me a nigger. I didn't understand what she was saying and what it meant. But after my mother explained to me, then I understood. But it still had very little meaning for me, very little meaning. Other than my cousins, I knew no other colored children except the children of a friend of my mother's. My mother belonged to a club, The Golden Rule Club of Cambridge, and one of her club members had four boys, and we used to visit. They used to come to our house and we used to see them. They lived in Maiden. In fact, one of the sons is now a practicing physician here in New York City—Dr. Sylvester Jefferson Carter, a hand surgeon.
One of the reasons I think I am very sympathetic now, and have been all of my life, to older people was because my mother was very sympathetic to older people. Her great-aunt came to live with us when I was about twelve years old, maybe younger than that. This is another interesting family relationship. My maternal grandmother died when my mother was about ten years old. This woman, Mary Ann Taylor, who was her great-aunt, was called "Auntie Taylor." She lived in Cambridge and earned her living by operating a hand laundry, the Cambridge Hand Laundry. But she didn't have ordinary customers in the laundry. Her specialty was laundering for the Harvard College students. And after she became old and crippled with arthritis and my mother offered her a home in our home, I used to love to hear her tell the stories about this Cambridge Hand Laundry. And among the people whose laundry she did was that of Theodore Roosevelt when he was a student. This was the Theodore Roosevelt who later became president of the United States. And she also used to tell about one student who lived with her, and I never made the connection till years later when I read W.E.B. DuBois's autobiography. In it he told about living as a student in Auntie Taylor's house because the black students could not live in the dormitories at that time. So she opened her home and rented rooms to Harvard students who were black, and DuBois was one of them. She had also come from Halifax, Nova Scotia, my grandfather's home. So the stories that Auntie Taylor used to tell about her life in Cambridge, and the stories that my grandfather used to tell, always made an impression upon me as a growing child.
And they all got to Nova Scotia by way of the underground railroad, part of that black link...﻿4
AT: Yes, yes. Now as I said, my father worked for the Day family, and we as children... Well, the Day house was up the hill. It was a great big Tudor type house, which is now the Norwood Historical Society. This is not the original house that my father first started working in in 1888, but it was built shortly thereafter. The very interesting thing about this Day family...Of course, it was the relationship of this wealthy white family and this black man working for the family. I used to go up and Mrs. Day would send for me because I was named after her. She would give us presents at holidays and so forth. But her husband, Mr. Day, had died. She was a widow and she had a son named Fred Holland Day. The name may not mean much to many people, but Fred Holland Day was a photographer, and had quite a reputation. He was a friend of Edward Steichen , who was the world famous photographer. In fact, Edward Steichen did quite a portrait study of Fred Day that has been published in many places. Mr. Day also, in the past when he was younger, was a publisher of rare books, and headed the publishing firm of Copeland and Day. I don't know where along the line this happened, but at one point—and it is said that it was when World War I started, which was 1914—Mr. Day, Fred Day, withdrew from life and went to the top story of his house, and became a recluse in his room. He started doing three things. One, tracing his own family—he did a genealogical study of his own family. Second, he was writing a history of the town of Norwood because his ancesters were founders of the town. And third, he had a great collection, in fact, one of the two greatest collections in the world, of works of the poet John Keats. We now reach the time about 1919. World War I is over. I remember the war, I remember Armistice Day. Mr. Day wanted someone to help him gather some records. I don't know what transpired between my father and him, but I was asked to come up there and work for him after school. I was in grammar school. This was 1919, so I was thirteen years old. The first thing he started me on was going to the cemetery to copy tombstone records, and I used to have to go to the public library and look up vital statistics. Then I got to the point where he would dictate letters to me, I would handwrite these letters. And I would help him with the... He would get out these Keatsiana things that he liked to look at. He traced his own family from Adam. He had a genealogical chart with Adam at one end and he was at the other end. But the other thing—I was doing this after school — on Saturdays, I didn't work for him, I was taking care of little children—mother's helper, babysitter, whatever you call it. So he did some other strange things. He was considered in the family as an eccentric. I remember 1921 was the anniversary of the death of John Keats. Well, there was an exhibit at the Boston Public Library and all of his collection went there.	I had to
catalogue, list the stuff as it was sent to the Boston Public Library, so at that time I learned an awful lot about John Keats.
CG: And cataloging and all, researching. So this catalogue is essentially your work.
Not my work, but I listed the materials and when they were received by the public library, of course, they listed what they wanted. But most of this exhibit was from his collection. One of the most interesting stories in connection with Fred Day and Keats happened—and it's in a book—because Stephen Parrish, when he was doing his doctoral thesis at Harvard, did a book called Keats and the Bostonians. But strange thing, in my life, not only then but after I came to the Urban League, I had an opportunity to﻿5
AT: (cont.) meet all kinds of people from all walks of life, from the top way
down. The other person who had a Keats collection was Amy Lowell, the poet, who was the sister of President Lowell of Harvard. She wanted to see Mr. Day's Keats collection, and he didn't want her to see it, so he had me take some of the very special letters and put them between glass and bind the edges so you could see the beginning of the letter and the beginning of the next letter, but you could never see who these letters were from, and that's what Miss Lowell wanted to see. So he told her one day to come out to Norwood and he would show her these letters. Miss Lowell was a very large lady, she must have weighed close to two hundred fifty pounds. Mr. Day had all the chairs removed in the room except a very small chair with arms. She couldn't sit down. And she was ushered into his room. I can remember even now how Miss Lowell looked when she came in and she saw there was no chair to sit in, and she stood—I was in the room—and she talked to him for two hours. And then at one point, he said, "Anna, please bring Miss Lowell the letters." And I proceeded to come from behind where I was, and present Miss Lowell with these letters under glass. And I thought she would have a stroke.
CG: she was that same Lowell that smoked a pipe?
AT: Yes. That was one of the funny stories. This was 1923, I guess, when I was a junior in high school. I was taking a business course, and wanted to take a civil service examination and get a job in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I took a civil service examination and came out number one on the stenographer list. At that time any department in the state that wanted to hire anybody had the choice of the first three people on the list. So I was called in and returned home and didn't get the job. This happened three different times. So my father was a little disturbed at this. He knew what was happening. The lieutenant governor, who was then Frank G. Allen, was also president of the bank in Norwood. My father knew him, everybody in town knew him. It's still a real small town. He would stop at the bank before going into the statehouse every morning. So my father went into the bank one morning and he told Mr. Allen that I had taken this exam, that I was called but never got a job, that I needed the job because I wanted to earn some money. So Lieutenant Governor Allen went into the statehouse, and ten o'clock that morning I got a call to come in for a job. So I started working at the statehouse after school and nights. I was in college at that time. It was during the Sacco-Vanzetti trial and I remember having to go through the guards to get into the statehouse, particularly at night because the building was heavily guarded.	I
worked all one summer and then in the fall. I worked almost a year and a half in that job.
Now let's get back to... I was in high school and I thought I wanted to go to BU [Boston University] to take the two-year secretarial course because I had not thought about going to college, and I was taking the business course in high school. When Mr. Day learned that I wanted to go, he said, "BU is no good." He said, "The best place to go is Simmons College." Well, I had never heard of Simmons College. I said, "Well, I want to go to BU and it's only a two-year course." And he said, "Well, Simmons College will give you a college degree." He said, "If you continue to work for me a little longer, I'll pay your first year's tuition to Simmons." He wouldn't﻿6
AT: (cont.) say anything about any more, but he said, "I'll pay your first year's tuition to Simmons." So I said, "This is great." But I did not have the qualifications for admission to Simmons, so I went back to high school and took a postgraduate course and took French I and French II, because I had no languages, and algebra and math, all the same year, and was admitted to Simmons the following September. I was still working for him part time, because often I would get out of class by one or two o'clock. I commuted to school, which was only twenty-five minutes outside Boston. And at that point came my first contact with other young black people, other than the few that I've mentioned. The day I registered at Simmons, a girl came up and spoke to me. Hfer name was Bertha Harris, now Bertha Harris Wormley. She was a sophomore,, and she said she was so glad to see me because the only other black student had graduated that year. I think that that person was Dorothy Boulding—Dr. Dorothy Ferebee now.
CG: Dorothy Ferebee graduated from Simmons?
AT: Yes, before she went to medical school. I think she had just finished, but I may be wrong in that. But there were no other blacks in Simmons. Then the next day we met another girl named Ellen Miller, who was a freshman, and Ellen Miller and I were the only two freshmen. There were a couple other girls who came, but never stayed. So we went through the four years of college together. So then I began to meet these other women blacks, such as Thompson, Mary Crutchfield then, who attended Tufts Medical Dental School which was right down the street from Simmons. Simmons was on the Fenway and Tufts at that time was on Huntington Avenue.
CG: Right. I think that Northeastern's bought the building.
AT: The Delta Sigma Theta and the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority were courting the freshmen, for some reason or other—I don't know what it was. I think between Bertha and Mary Crutchfield, they convinced me to become an Ivy Leaf. So I joined the Ivy Leaf of AKA, and began to go to the Ivy Leaf meetings and to the AKA's... the first time I had ever been to parties where we were all black. Because probably some of the other people you've talked to—we're now in the middle twenties, '24, '25, '26— the middle-class blacks from the South who did not want to send their children to black colleges sent them to New England because the New England schools were so good. There was no school social life for the college student in the Boston area, none of it. We had to make our social life among ourselves. So that over the weekends and Easter holidays and various times when the students couldn't go back home because the travel distance was great to the South, or wherever they came from, we used to have all our social activities together, and the chapters of Omega and AKA and Delta and Alpha Phi Alpha— all these black boys and girls became friends.
I remember the first party I went to was a Valentine's Day party that AKA had and Ivy Leaf people were there. Countee Cullen was there, because he was a Harvard student. And through those four years when I was in college, Countee Cullen, Bob Weaver, Mortimer Weaver, people who now, if they're living are important men; if they're not living, they were important names during their lifetimes. Cecil Blue, Guichard Parris, Hollis Price,﻿7
AT: (cont.) who's past president of LeMoyne College; Allison Davis, Ed Morrow, Fred Morrow. I see Hollis off and on now. Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Bates, Bowdoin, Radcliffe, Smith, Mount Holyoke—Mae Wright, Billie Jeter— from all these colleges, all the group that was in school, we knew one another, and our social activities were...
CG: Where were parties held?
AT: In Boston there were two women's groups. One was the Women's Service
League, which was 464 Massachusetts Avenue, and the other was the Women's...
CG: League for Community Service?
AT: League for Community Service, at 558 Massachusetts Avenue. They used to have rooms for students, too. Many of the social activities were there. There was also what was called the Students' Union. Marian Conover was president of that Students' Union at one time, and Edward Hope, son of John Hope, president of Atlanta University, was at Tufts at that time. They later got married. The Robert Gould Shaw House was another student center on Hammond Street in Roxbury. Constance Ridley was the head, she was executive of the Shaw House at that time. She later married Attorney Jesse Heslip. A lot of the meetings were held there, the parties, the meetings—we came to most of these places. Then we would go around. By the time when I was a junior—yes, when I was a junior—another event happened that was significant in my life. Anne DeBerry came in as a sophomore. She was at Fisk University when the students had a strike at Fisk, and those students who went on strike, the administration wouldn't admit them back into the school, so she came to Simmons.
CG: Anne DeBerry. Why do I know the name?
AT: Well, maybe you'll recognize the name as I go along. In the spring of my junior year, which was spring '26, I went to Springfield with Anne on an Easter vacation. Her father was Reverend William Nelson DeBerry, he was executive of the Urban League branch in Springfield which was known as the St. John's Institutional Activities. He was also minister of the St. John's Congregational Church. So I remember, that Easter Anne had a party and invited all the students from the New England colleges. We had a nice party that weekend. I have to put a pinpoint on that, because that was my junior year. Also, after having associated with these other students, I began to be more concerned about colored people and so forth, and hearing all these various stories, and beginning to learn about discrimination. So I wanted to find out what people were doing about this, so I got the name of the NAACP and the Urban League, and I wrote to both organizations, asked for literature on their program. And for some reason or other, what I got from the Urban League interested me more than what I got from the NAACP. But I had to put a pinpoint in there, put it aside.
We are now at the point where I'm taking a secretarial course at Simmons. However, since I'd had so many business subjects in high school, I was taking more science courses at Simmons. But I did take accounting. In the senior year we had an accounting professor, and he warned us that the country was headed for a depression. He said, "When you graduate next June, if anybody﻿8
AT: (cont.) offers you a job for even $25 a week, you better take it, because jobs are going to be very scarce within a year." So we all listened to him and thought nothing of it. The spring of my senior year, Anne DeBerry's father came down to visit her in Boston, and he said the girl who was working for him as a secretary was getting ready to leave and go to New York to work for the Urban League, and he wanted somebody to take her position. Would I take the job? He told me he could pay maybe $25 a week. So remembern'na what Professor Wallace Turner said, I said, yes, I would take the job. I thought to myself, it's the Urban League and I was interested in the Urban League, so I think I'll take the job. So in the spring of 1928 I had a job offer for the day I graduated at $25 a week working for the Urban League.
I told my father and mother. They never had opposed anything that I wanted to do within reason. It meant leaving home, but that was no problem. When I was at Simmons, I didn't join too many things because I was working part time, I was commuting, I didn't have much time. I did join the YW and was active in the YW at school and in the city. And I did have a few friends among the other students there, but I never really formed any close friendships with any of the students. The other person that I mentioned in class with me, Ellen Miller—we were friends, and when I was a junior, another girl came in, Gertrude Franklin, who was registered in the School of Library Science. I was a junior, Anne DeBerry was a sophomore, and Gertrude Franklin was a freshman. There never were too many of us at one time—I think four were the most. But then came graduation time, and the commencement line was graded from the shortest to the tallest. Ellen Miller was 5'6" or 7" tall, she was a very tall girl. They put Ellen Miller and me together at the end of the line. I never forgot that—never. Two black girls at the end of the line. I was short, she was tall. I said, "If I ever have the chance, anywhere, to say anything about this, I'm going to say it," because it upset me at the time. I got my degree. I think this was the fourth of June, and on the fifteenth of June I started working for the Urban League affiliate in Springfield.
They operated Camp Atwater in East Brookfield, Massachusetts, and that is where I went to start my first job. And at Camp Atwater I did everything. I was Dr. DeBerry's secretary, handled the commissary, ordered the food and other goods for the commissary, and handled the children's fees, all that. And then in September, I went into Springfield and worked in Springfield. The job there included everything, because the organization operated a boys' club program and a girls' club program, an employment program where they furnished day workers. They had rental apartments, so that I had to handle the monies that came in for the rent, get the mail, take dictation, count the church collection after Sunday services. It was an all-around job. As I say, they were affiliated with the National Urban League, although at that time it was not called the Springfield Urban League. The national office used to send its staff members around in the field to meet and talk with the local executives.
In 1929, after I'd been there about a year, T. Arnold Hill, who was the director of industrial relations at the National Urban League, made a field visit. And I don't know what there was about what I was doing impressed﻿9
AT: (cont.) him, but he asked me if I would like to come to the national office because his secretary was leaving. Now you remember, I mentioned that Dr. DeBerry told me the person who worked for him was going to the national. She was down there. I had met her and worked with her about a week before she left. So I said, "I've just been here a year. I don't think I should leave and go to New York." But the idea of coming to New York was very fascinating. So Mr. Hill said, "Well, think about it. Maybe some other time you would like to." So I told Dr. DeBerry and he said, well...he gave me more money, and I stayed. Mr. Hill came again on a field visit in 1930, and he asked me did I want to come to New York to the National Urban League, and this time I said yes. On December 1, 1930, I left Springfield and came to the National Urban League to be the secretary to T. Arnold Hill, director of industrial relations.
The interesting thing was that I reported on December 1, 1930. A week later Mr. Hill left on an extended field trip to the West. At that time League workers didn't get on a plane and go to Los Angeles or elsewhere and come back in two days. On a field trip, the executives would leave and be gone for two or three weeks, because they stopped at all the various Urban Leagues across the country.
So here I was, new to the National Urban League, in a job that I knew a very little bit about; and all Mr. Hill told me to do was to open the mail and acknowledge, and say he was on a field trip and it would have his attention when he came back; and to do some filing of some materials that hadn't been filed; and if I wanted to reset the files up, I should do so. Well, when the mail started coming in, it distressed me a great deal to answer a question by saying Mr. Hill is away and it would have his attention when he comes back, because the mail that was coming in was from teachers, young people, parents, and they were all in the same vein. The teachers were saying, "What shall we tell these children about jobs, and what kind of jobs and careers can they plan for?" And there were letters coming in from people with college training saying, "I've been to college, I've got a degree, but I can't find a job. Where are the best jobs?" Other letters were saying they felt there was too much discrimination, their college education was wasted. And some of the teachers were saying, "We need to give these children vocational guidance." I didn't know what vocational guidance was—I'd never had any. So I said, "Well, I can't even answer these letters intelligently. I think I'll find out what vocational guidance is all about, and what some of the problems are." And since I had my bachelor's degree, I thought, well, maybe I've got to take an evening course at Columbia.
I went up to Columbia in September—not at that time, but the following year^-because I couldn't answer these letters, but they kept coming in. So the following year I went up to Columbia and I registered for a course in vocational guidance. It became interesting to me. I thought maybe I had better register for a degree. So I went up on the hill and asked who was the advisor in the vocational guidance field. He was a person named Dr. Harry D. Kitson. He was one of the leading authorities in the country in the vocational guidance field. Dr. Kitson said to me, "I'm very glad to see you.﻿10
AT: (cont.) There are no colored people trained in vocational guidance." He
said, "You're in the Urban League, it's an excellent field in which you'll be, because as time goes on colored people are going to need vocational guidance." He suggested that I register for a master's degree. I registered for a master's degree in vocational guidance and personnel administration. That was the degree they were granting at that time. And it took me ten years from the time I got my bachelor's degree to get this master's degree. The reason it took so long was I could only take a few courses at a time at night and on Saturday. I was working full time and the pressure got too great, and I got sick and had to stop, and went back, and by the time I had half of the thirty points required, I thought, well, I might as well finish. I' ve gotten this far, there's no sense in quitting. Dr. Kitson was the one person who encouraged me to keep on going. He helped me, he guided me, and as you'll note a little later, some of the things I was doing in the Urban League, I got credit for as part of my course up at Columbia.
In 1930, T. Arnold Hill had said to a group of Urban League executives that it was time young people, young colored girls and boys were given some opportunity to get more in terms of interesting careers to think about, and that vocational variation was the thing that we had to be concerned with. He initiated in the spring of 1930 what was called a Vocational Opportunity Campaign. And every spring the Urban League planned to do something to call the attention of young people and their parents and teachers to jobs and careers. The first campaign was in the spring of '30, and beginning with the second campaign in 1931 until the last one, and I can't remember when the last one was...I directed these efforts.
CP
And this was during the depression too, wasn't it? The depression had started?
AT: From '31 to... We ran those campaigns about fifteen years, and he turned over the operation of those campaigns to me. Now at that time I bore the title of secretary, and from 1930 to 1940 I had the title of secretary, but I was doing a job in the field of vocational guidance. In 1941 I got a title, assistant in charge of guidance and personnel.
c r •
It s absolutely interesting to see how things have changed in terms of what you would take in college, and what you really were was a college-educated secretary.
AT:
Oh, well, I was the first college-trained secretary ever to come into the Urban League. Now they are here, but I was the first one with college training who entered the Urban League. I don't like to sound pretentious, but Lloyd Garrison, who was president of the Urban League in 1951, did the introduction to a booklet called "Ever Widening Horizons," and the introduction pays a tribute to me. The booklet tells the story of all these campaigns. But the tribute says—this is a quotation—"To Ann Tanneyhill, the National Urban League's Director of Vocational Guidance. The Urban League movement must pay a special tribute in telling the story of the Vocational Opportunity Campaign. Starting with the League in 1930 as clerical assistant to the late T. Arnold Hill, director of the Department﻿11
AT: (cont.) of Industrial Relations, Miss Tanneyhill has worked on every campaign but the first; and she, more than any other individual, has been responsible for organizing and steering the work. 'I am going to put you down in my memoirs as the modern Joan of Arc of the Urban League,' the executive director of the Los Angeles Urban League wrote to her. To that appraisal I would only add this: the armies of the maid of Orleans went down to defeat, but the Urban League movement marches forward with ever growing strength, under the inspiring leadership of many soldiers of humanity, of whom Ann Tanneyhill is among the foremost."
CG: That is nice.
AT: Now I will say that the whole operation of vocational guidance for Negro youth has been the thing that has been the whole consuming...has consumed my life in the Urban League. In fact, I would not have stayed with the Urban League as long as I have stayed if I hadn't been motivated by this, if I hadn't felt that it was the one area of black life that needed the most attention. And I feel very distressed today when I see so many youngsters on the streets with nothing to do.	Using the phrase that President
Conant of Harvard used twenty years ago, they're "social dynamite" because they have no direction; the schools are not giving them what they need, they're not career minded. And that's why I kept at this for so many, many years. You see, I'm just completing my fiftieth year with the Urban League. I've been in the Urban League since 1928, and this is 1978. So that some of the things that happened during this process of helping Negro youth toward jobs may be sort of interesting.
The Vocational Opportunity Campaigns, as I said, were conducted in the spring of each year. We worked with high schools and colleges all over the country—with the black high schools in the South, with the black colleges, and the integrated, so-called integrated, schools of the North. During the depression years, we weren't able to do much, but we still worked on the problem. We had all kinds of meetings, we worked with parents, with teachers. One of the things that was most interesting was during the war years, right before the war. This was before the days of television. The radio stations had a lot of public service time. Of course, in my younger days I would try anything once, you know. And I had the freedom to do pretty much as I wanted. We wrote to the various radio stations around the country to see if we could get some time on radio to tell the Urban League story. And one of the most interesting programs was in the spring of 1941. I'm jumping around a little here. I wrote a letter to Columbia Broadcasting Company and asked them if we could have fifteen minutes of time to tell something about the Vocational Opportunity Campaign. We didn't get any answer from the letter. And then about three weeks after, a letter came from CBS saying they would be very happy to grant us an hour's time on Sunday afternoon at four o'clock on the CBS network, if we could give them some kind of a program that would be of interest to the general public. Well, at that time there was a fellow named Ed Lawson who was on the staff. He was editor of Opportunity at that time. So we sat down and said, "What can we do?"
Opportunity was the journal?﻿12
AT: Opportunity was the journal of the Urban League. The full title was
Opportunity: Journal of Negro Life. We said, "What can we do?" So he said, "Well, the best thing, if they want something, let's get some entertainment." So we said, "What kind of entertainment can we get?" So he said, "Let's get together something that will be exciting." We sat down and figured out a show, and they only gave us ten days to do it. It required an awful lot of hard work. So between the two of us, we appealed to a lot of people to help. First, we went to the union and asked them to give us a union waiver, so we wouldn't have to pay artists any costs. We got a waiver from Local 802 of the AF of L, the Musicians' Union. Then we knew a lot of people. All of the letters of invitation went out over Mr. Eugene Kinckle Jones's signature, because he was the head of the organization. We asked Marian Anderson. Well, I knew Bill Robinson because I used to eat in a restaurant where he dined every night, and I saw him frequently.
CG; This is in New York now?
AT: This was in New York. I asked Bill Robinson, we wrote to Ethel Waters, we
wrote to Rochester, who was on the "Jack Benny Show," called Ella Fitzgerald, we asked Duke Ellington, we asked Louis Armstrong, John Kirby the musician and bass fiddler, and then Canada Lee. He was playing on Broadway in Native Son at the time. I knew Canada—he was a friend of mine. I told you a long time ago, being around here and being in the Urban League, you have an opportunity to meet all kinds of people. So we asked Canada if he would narrate the show for us, and he said yes. And we put together a one-hour coast-to-coast network show that had all these people in it. The lieutenant-governor of New York, W. Charles Poletti, was on the Urban League board; he spoke. Mr. Jones spoke. Joe Louis was on the show. This was the first time that there had been an hour-long network show with an all-black cast. So it gave a lot of publicity to what we were doing through our program.
The next year, getting ready for war, we were in defense industry. I was always full of ideas. I dreamed up the idea to get some matches and put an Urban League slogan on them and get the matches distributed around the country. We had some matches made with the slogan, "One-tenth of America's citizens are Negroes. Train them, hire them, and work with them." Wendell Wilkie was campaigning at that time, and Anne Wiggins Brown was in Porgy and Bess. We asked Anne Wiggins Brown and Wendell Wilkie to help. She presented the first packet of these matches to Wendell Wilkie. Then we got all kinds of prominent people to distribute the matches, to use the matches. We sent complimentary boxes to the governors, to senators, to Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of the president; and local Urban Leagues bought them and distributed them. And that was our match campaign, which was part of the Vocational Opportunity Campaign that year. That was '42. Then in 'A3 we were in the middle of the war, and I went to see Edward G. Robinson and asked him if he would do something for the Urban League. So he said, "Yes, I'll read something on the radio if you'll get the script." So I got together a script. Edward G. Robinson read it on the air.
Of course, when I first visited New York in '28, it was just the ending of the Negro Renaissance in Harlem. So I began to meet a lot of people. I had met Langston Hughes. Langston and I were good friends. I said, "Look,﻿13
AT: (cont.) Langston, will you write a poem for the Urban League? If you write
the poem, we'll get it on radio some way or other." So he said, "Sure, sure." I was living in the Dunbar Apartments at that time, so I said, "Come on up to the house and let's sit down and talk about it." So one evening Langston came up to my house. We had a little dinette, sort of, as a dining room. Langston sat on one side of the table and I sat on the other side of the table. He said, "What do you want?" I said, "I can't tell you what we want." He said, "Well, I got an idea." And he started writing a poem for the Urban League. He entitled it "Freedom's Plow." And when he got home, he typed out the first draft and brought it back, and we looked at it and read it. He was finally satisfied with it. That was '43.
Paul Muni was playing in Inherit the Wind. I would dare do anything, you know. And for some reason or another, I've always found that entertainers are very receptive to... So somebody else and I—I don't remember who it was—went backstage at the theater to ask Paul Muni. Told him Langston Hughes had written a poem, and would he read it on the radio for us. Well, we worked out a date, Paul Muni read the poem "Freedom's Plow" with background music by the Golden Gate Quartet. It made quite an impression at schools.	Everybody was asking Langston for copies, so we assigned
the copyright to Langston- It was very popular, a very popular poem. And that was the year also that CBS said, "You want some more time?" We said, "Yes, give us an hour." So we felt that we ought to do something about women on this program, because that was the year we used the slogan, "Woman Power is Vital to Victory." We were in the midst of war industry then. CBS said, "We want dramatics, something dramatic." I didn't know anything about radio writing. But I went to the public library and got a book on radio script writing, and I wrote a script because I felt we should do something about women. So I wrote the script and took it off to CBS, and the producer said, "Who did this script?" I said, "I did." He said, "Where did you learn to write radio script?" I said, "Out of a book."
So anyway, they edited it and worked it over, and we came up with a script called "Heroines in Bronze," and Canada Lee again did the narration. We started out with Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, and worked up to some of the women who were in the armed services, and who were in the Red Cross overseas. And we did pickups overseas, we did one of the Red Cross workers, and we did a pickup of a woman in the war industry who was in a war plant, and so forth. That was a really good show. I'm trying to remember some of the other outstanding...
Well, by that time we felt in order to get youngsters more interested in some of the important Negroes whom we considered heroes.	Knowing
that comic books were very popular, I said, "Let's do a comic book for kids." Well, the Urban League didn't have too much money then, so we tried to enlist the support of another group, and Delta Sigma Theta came along and said, "We'll cosponsor this with you, and we'll put up the money." So we did two issues, one in 1947 and one in 1948, called "Negro Heroes." And we did stories of George Washington Carver, Joe Louis, Dorie Miller, the navy hero. They were very popular books, but the distribution was beyond our capability. We had to give it up. They were so popular, and the distribution for comic books is a business, and we just couldn't do it. But I still have a few copies around.﻿14
AT: (cont.) I'm skipping around now, some of the important things. I forgot
to mention that somewhere around the line in the 1930s, we edited... That is, Mr. Hill was in the industrial department; he edited a series of booklets called"The Color Line Series." Some were about jobs. But I did one called "Guiding Negro Youth Toward Jobs," and this was a booklet for the local Urban Leagues around the country, what to do to help young people find jobs. And one of the things I had in it was about creating job opportunities; I recommended something. It was really consumer protest, to withhold purchasing from certain companies that didn't employ Negroes.	I had
recommended boycotting, which wasn't a thing the Urban League was doing in those days for a couple years. And this was one of the things that Dr. Kitson gave me course credit for when I was going to my last year up at Teachers College,
CG: So did you have anything to do with the Urban League fellowship program that was...
AT: No. I stayed strictly...I was moved along, I became secretary of the Bureau of Vocational Guidance, and then they combined the guidance and the placement of the people in the Urban League movement. I used to interview the people who came to look for jobs in the Urban League. I can't place the date now. One of the other things that I was assigned to do was do placement, and guidance and placement was my title... but to interview people who wanted to work in the Urban League.	At that time people who were looking
for jobs, who had college training, would come to the Urban League whether they wanted to work for the Urban League or other social agencies. And so I did an awful lot of interviewing. Here again, I met and I talked and gave guidance and counsel to many people who today are spread all around the country. Many of them are executives. But I think one of the most interesting letters that I had was, and I'm quoting now from an article I wrote for Columbia Library Columns last year, and this is a quotation: "On a morning in the fall of 1946, seated at my desk in the National Urban League headquarters in New York City, I was reviewing the morning's mail. My duties included handling correspondence from persons seeking employment in the Urban League movement. Little did I realize that one letter among those on my desk was to profoundly change the direction and future of the entire Urban League. The letter, postmarked Saint Paul, Minnesota, was short, simple and to the point. 'Dear Miss Tanneyhill, I am interested in working for the Urban League. Please send me an application for employment. Whitney M. Young, Jr.' The application was sent by return mail. Often we do not know and cannot foresee how insignificant acts or events become the catalyst to change the destiny of men and of nations. So it was with that simple letter, for it began the steady and inexorable journey of one man from obscurity to national leadership, and then to^a tragic death on the beach at Lagos, Nigeria, twenty-five years later." The first letter Whitney Young ever wrote to the Urban League came to my desk. Whitney used to joke about that many years later. He used to talk about it. So that was during the time I did guidance and placement. Then one year I left that job—no, let me go back.﻿15
AT: (cont.) One of the other things we did in connection with the Vocational Opportunity Campaign and trying to urge young people to choose jobs and careers, we decided that not enough blacks were taking civil service examinations. So we arranged at the national office to give instruction to people how to fill out civil service applications, what to expect in the examination, and we really coached them. We had coaching classes, and we urged the local Urban Leagues to do the same on their local level. Particularly we were concerned about the jobs in the public employment service, because through the public employment service came so many blacks who were being discriminated against by interviewers.	There were not enough black
interviewers in the civil service system around the nation. The employment system had then become public, it was the United States Employment Service, but it was operated in all the states. So we began a series, in New York City,of preparation to take the employment service examination for the New York State Employment Service," and we urged the local leagues in other cities—Illinois, Virginia, wherever it was—and we prepared the materials, sent them out, sample questions and so forth, and told the people how to act in an interview, oral interview.	I'm not positive about the
year, but I think it was '41 or '42 that we made a special effort, concentrated on the employment service. And when the exams came out in New York State, most of the people who were in our coaching class came out on top of the lists. They got some jobs, and one of the people who started out as an employment interviewer ended up a number of years later as the director of the employment service office in Jamaica. The most outstanding example was in the state of Virginia, when all the people on all the lists—the top people were black. And of course, the system was segregated then, and they didn't know what to do about it.	I.n Virginia what they finally did,
and in Georgia--they opened up employment offices in the black neighborhoods. There were none then. They opened them in the neighborhoods and put in charge the people who came out on top of the exam.
Now, I did the same thing. I decided if you're going to coach for an exam, you'd better take an exam yourself, so you know what all this employment service job is about. So I took the exam for employment service interviewer in the state of New York, and I came out number one. No, it wasn't employment. The one I took was director of education for the department of hospitals.	I came out number one on the list. So they sent for me to
take the job as director of education up at the hospital in upstate New York. Well, I went and had the oral interview and everything, but then I decided I didn't want the job, I'd rather stay in the Urban League. So I turned the job down, stayed with the Urban League. Mr. Granger said at that time, in a news release,when they'd said that I'd placed first on the list, he said, "Miss Tanneyhill's action is typical of the action that Urban League secretaries throughout the country have taken in refusing posts which are open to them in government and private employment. They feel that their work in the League is the most important service that they can render and are therefore choosing to remain at their battle stations."
CG: At their battle stations.
AT: So staying at this battle station, I moved on to a program which we call... Of course, the Urban League had all kinds of ways of raising money, and usually staff was not allowed to participate in any fundraising. But one time there was a gentleman named Dr. Ross Thalheimer. He wanted to﻿16
AT: (cont.) give some money to the Urban League, and a number of the ideas he
was presented with he didn't like. So finally Granger suggested maybe he'd like to give some money to offer some cash prizes for essays. So we did offer some prizes for essays and we ran this contest for a number of years. Then each year in Opportunity magazine, the spring issue was devoted to the Vocational Opportunity Campaign, and I was coeditor of those issues. And one year—and here again I'm not sure of the date, it was in the forties— we had a series of essays, "What I Want to Be," and one of the winners of the essay at that time-r-we published it in the Opportunity magazine-was a girl who was a student at Antioch College, and her name was Coretta Scott. I had not met her, and after that, when I was doing one of my field trips—I haven't mentioned field trips—I went to Antioch College to speak to a group of students, and Coretta was there and I met her. She was about to graduate, and she wanted to go to Boston to the conservatory of music.	We became friends at that time. And it became a question
pf where she was to live in Boston. She couldn't afford to live in a dormitory, she had no place to live. So I suggested that a friend of mine— and we go back again to Bertha Harris, who was a sophomore when I was a freshman, who was then married and lived in Natick, and had a room— I suggested to Coretta that maybe she could live with Bertha and her husband. And Coretta did live in Natick with Bertha and her husband. Of course you know Coretta later married Martin Luther King, so that was the relationship that developed there.
So now we get up to about, through World War II when people were employed in defense industry and the Urban League was making great inroads into employment. And we had been operating the Vocational Opportunity Campaigns, working with the schools and colleges, in the main with young people, with their teachers and counselors, and doing some work with the parents. But Mr. Hill had left the Urban League and Julius Thomas came in as director of industrial relations.	He began working with big industry and came
up with the idea that maybe—since when the industry recruiters went out in the spring, they never went to black colleges, they went to the white colleges, and seldom interviewed black students who might be in white colleges—that maybe he could get a couple of the industries to go down to one of the black colleges and do some recruiting. So he invited General Electric Company, General Cable Corporation, Radio Corporation of America to interview the June 1949 graduates of the School of Engineering at Howard...
CG: Okay. So you were saying it was at the School of Engineering at Howard.
AT: At Howard. And of course I was in the department, still doing vocational guidance, so I went down to Howard with Mr. Thomas.	The program was
so successful that we decided maybe we should broaden this whole program and develop what we call career conferences. So we developed a series of career conferences beginning in 1950, in the spring of the year, when we Invited the personnel representatives from large companies, from labor unions, and from government, to come to the campuses of black colleges and spend a couple of days talking about jobs, opportunities in their firms, and so forth. And we offered these career conferences for about five years.
Did you do the design and layout of these?﻿17
AT: No. We went to Tennessee A&I, to Bethune-Cookman, to Virginia State, to Arkansas State, to Howard University, among the schools that we visited. We took anywhere from fifty to a hundred consultants from these industrial firms, who sat with the students, who talked with them, who had individual conferences, group conferences, and we had some of the biggest industries in the country represented. Now for instance, in the school year '51-'52... We went to Tuskegee also. We had about ninety-nine firms represented, who sent one or more consultants, including the government agencies, and these programs lasted for four or five years. It was one of the big events in the whole career guidance operation. This was what we would do. We would go down into the campus, meet with the students and the faculty ahe d of time, plan it out, and an awful lot of field work was done. Even before the career conferences, which I forgot to mention, we did a great deal of field work. We had a southern regional office in Atlanta. I would leave New York City and pick up a staff person in the southern region. After the guidance program got underway, we were able to hire somebody to work in the southern regional office, and we would make a field trip visiting local Urban Leagues, meeting with the students, teachers, parents in the evenings.	I remember one year I did about fifty-thousand miles
in the South, gOxng up and down the coast, down to Miami, back up the coast, visiting all the schools and colleges, even some backwoods schools.
CG= What did you think of the South? 'Cause you told me you were born in the North.
AT: Oh, by this time I had gotten used to all that. I had traveled around so much. Of course I...it was hard to defy the segregation, which was... but you see, then we traveled by train or automobile. I could go down to Atlanta by train... One of the very interesting things about travel in that day and time—I've only ridden in Jim Crow once, and that was between Washington and Virginia—but the people who traveled in the main in that day and time were NAACP staff, Urban League staff, and entertainers and musicians. Of course, you couldn't stay in hotels, so that around the country in the South there were families who had special provisions, either their homes, they had rooms, or some people had little additions built on their house, or special sections. I know a woman in Jacksonville, Florida, Mrs. Smith—everyone called her "Ma Smith"—she had two bedrooms and a special bath, and a portion of her house was only for the people who traveled. In the main she would have Urban League staff, NAACP staff, and some of the musicians. If you didn't stay there, then you stayed at a college campus that had a faculty house or guest house. Many times I've stayed in Dorothy Hall at Tuskegee or in Holly Tree Inn in Hampton, wherever it might be, because the colleges then had special guest houses. And you rode in Pullman. You do not know what lower thirteen is, do you?
CG: No, no.
There was no such berth as lower thirteen, because they don't use the number thirteen. If a black person came to a ticket office and wanted a Pullman accommodation, they would be given a bedroom, and the ticket would read lower thirteen. Everybody knew, conductors, everybody knew that this was a black person who was going to have a bedroom, and it was alower-berth rate, so they wouldn't come in contact with a white traveler.﻿18
CG: And that's how you avoided the Jim Crow.
AT: But you ate in the dining car behind the curtains. You ate behind the curtain in the dining car. There was a section, at the end of the dining car; there was a separation for a table that would seat four, and a curtain was drawn around it. This was where the waiters ate, too. But you would be ushered into there. You would walk into the dining car, you'd be seated immediately because you were put behind the curtain in the special section. And you were in lower thirteen. And many is the time I've ridden in the Pullman with a bedroom, and eaten in the diner. You got awfully nice treatment from the dining car waiters and the Pullman porters. But this is the way we traveled. That went on for many years. Of course, sometimes when I went South, I would go to Atlanta and then drive. There would be a person from the southern field. I remember one trip I made with George Edwards, who was the guidance person in the southern field, and we left Atlanta, went all down the Georgia coast; we stopped at Albany State, Savannah State, the high schools in town, all down in through Jacksonville, West Palm Beach, Miami, up the other side, by automobile. But we stayed on the campuses. We had to sleep on the campus, you see. And there were some times when you'd have to drive a longer distance because you dare not stop, you know, along the way. But that was the way it went, just the way it went. It was many years after that the Urban League staff started plane travel, and sometimes it amuses me now, staff people going out on these field trips; they really don't know what a field trip is— don't know what a field trip is. I remember once in Jacksonville, there were some places you couldn't eat, and if you did eat in a public restaurant, it was a very bad restaurant. Usually if you went into an Urban League town, you had to stay with the local executive director and sometimes eat in his home. But this was what you did. I made my first field trip in 1936, when I visited a number of local Urban Leagues around the country, in Pennsylvania and Ohio. When I first came into the Urban League, there were fourteen people on the national staff and today there are about three hundred. But there were just fourteen when I first came.
In 1958, after we were operating the career conferences, we started a program which was called "Tomorrow's Scientists and Technicians." We were trying to get... There was a need for people in the sciences, science field, so we had a program which was really a motivation program for young people, and we got older people to serve as sort of role models for young people. And this was conducted in Urban League cities around the country. That program went on for a number of years. In 1958 we did our first motion picture. We got a special grant to do a movie and we did a motion picture called, A Morning for Jimmy, and one of the first...I believe it was the first really motivational film for black youth. It was very popular. It took a young boy whose father told him he shouldn't aspire, you know, to anything, shouldn't go on and study. His mother wanted to motivate him to do so, and his sister told him it'd be no use anyway. Incidentally, the sister in that film was Cecily Tyson. And that film was very successful, it was part of the "Tomorrow's Scientists and Technicians" program. And a couple years later we did another film called The Road Ahead, which was also a motivational film.﻿19
AT: (cont.) When I first came into the Urban League, the executive director was Eugene Kinckle Jones. Mr. Jones served from 1917 to 1941, so he was the first executive under whom I served. And he was really an elder statesman. He did a great deal for the Urban League movement in the days when it was unpopular to be doing things for blacks. Then Lester Granger came and served from 1941 to 1961. I was very fond of Lester, and we developed a very warm friendship over the years. Whitney Young came in 1961 and served until 1971. He died in 1971.
The retirement from the Urban League is based on twenty-five years service and age 65, so I was due to retire in January 1971. At the Urban League conference in July 1970, Whitney Young established in my name what is called the Ann Tanneyhill Award. It is a plaque and a check for a thousand dollars, which is given to an employee of the National Urban League, who has demonstrated, in my tradition, "commitment and dedication to the National Urban League through years of service." It was a complete surprise to me. "it was given to me as the first recipient in July 1970, and it's been awarded every year since, and continues to be awarded to a person on the National Urban League staff. Right before I retired in January '71, Whitney asked me if I would continue to stay on as a special assistant in his office, working on either a part-time or full-time basis, whatever I chose. So I agreed to do this, and so I began almost immediately, the first of February, '71, and on the 11th of March '71, Whitney died. Harold Simms came in as the acting director and he said I had to stay because, to help him get over the, you know,	task of assuming the acting
directorship. Then in the fall of '71, when Vernon Jordan came, he asked me to stay, and I'm still here. So I'm a consultant, but I bear the title of special assistant in the executive office, and I work with Vernon and some of the other staff members on a lot of things. You see, I am now the person oldest in terms of service, and with a continuity of service that no one else possesses.
'Cause you came in under the second director.
■^T: That's right. I have served under every executive director except the
first, who was George Edmund Haynes, and under every president except the first two. And people come to me and ask me what happened in x year or something, and I do my best to remember and bring them up to date.
CG: How often do people do that?
A-T: All the time. Now there are some things that I've left out. One of the things is to do...I stopped where I was doing the guidance work. All this period of time I used to do a lot of writing. I'm not a great writer, but I can write. I did an awful lot of ghostwriting over the years, both for Hill and for Granger, and I wrote a lot of booklets and pamphlets which were published by the Urban League. I've contributed many articles to guidance publications when I was doing guidance work. Whitney came in; before he got his regular writer, I used to write some of his speeches, so I've been writing over the years. One of the pieces I did write was a booklet for Public Affairs Pamphlets called, "From School to Job: Guidance for Minority Youth." And one of the things that I said in this booklet, and which was the basic philosophy under which I've operated over the years,﻿20
(cont.) "We believe that Negro youth have the capacity to perform all kinds of jobs, and that it is dangerous in the long run for society to place any barriers against the maximum use of an individual's ability to produce for the entire society." Even when I was in school—I talked about Dr. Kitson—but there was a master's degree program at NYU...and the person in charge of that department was Dr. Robert Hoppock. And Dr. Hoppock and I were at swords' points all the time. He used to bring groups of his graduate students to the Urban League, and I would meet with these groups. He took the position that you should not guide Negro or colored boys and girls into, help them to jobs that they could not get, jobs that there were no Negroes in, and that they should be guided toward the traditional jobs. I always took the opposite point of view, and even in front of his students I had arguments with him on this. And it was many years later he conceded to me that I was quite correct. Because when the job picture changed, if we had not been guiding these youngsters to get training for these jobs, then where would we be? I did an article for Occupational Trends, back in 1951. It was entitled, "They Made It and Others Can TooT" It traced the change in the job narket and what the Urban League was doing in motivating young people to take training to get certain kinds of jobs, and the fact that if we had not helped guide and direct them, then they would not have been ready for some of these jobs when they came along. I'm hopping around now because there's some things that I forgot...
Now when Granger left and Whitney Young came in, I took the position, the new boss is coming in, maybe see if he wants you to stay. But in the meantime, I had gotten an assistant in the vocational guidance operation.' So Whitney said, "Well, let your assistant take over, and why don't you go into the public relations department, because I think, you know, with your writing skills and everything else, you can be helpful there." So in 1961 I went into the...I became assistant director for public relations, and Guichard Parris was the public relations director. That's another interesting experience, because Parris was a student at Amherst College while I was a student at Simmons and I met him the spring of '26, the time I met Hollis Price and some of these other people, at this party that Anne DeBerry had.
°h, yes.
And we are friends to this day. In fact, I was partially responsible for him coming into the Urban League. He came into the Urban League in the industrial relations department to help raise funds, and he remained in the Urban League until he retired. So, he was director of public relations, I was assistant director of public relations, and then in this job I continued to do a lot of writing. I worked with publications, I was director of the little information bureau we had; then I moved up into associate director of public relations. All the Urban League conferences at that time were the operation of the public relations department, so I began to work in planning and arranging the annual conferences of the Urban League.
Now it so happened that back in the early years, the conferences were held in Urban League cities, but we couldn't use hotels, so we were housed in people's homes, and when I was in the industrial relations department,﻿21
(cont.) I used to work helping plan the conferences. We had no public relations department then, so that I was working on the Urban League conferences then. So they moved into the fifties, the first hotel conference was held, I think, in either '50 or '51, in a hotel. This was in '50, Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was the first Urban League conference in a hotel. In fact, it was the first major black or interracial organization that held a conference in a center-city hotel, and it was so successful, the hotel management was so pleased with the way it operated, that we began to have offers from other hotels all around the country. And not only Urban League, but other black organizations were invited to have hotel conferences, and of course it's a big operation now.
After Mr. Parris retired, they set up a conferences department.	I
served as director of conferences from 1968 to 1971, and I had to make the contacts with the hotels. It's very interesting to see the expression on some of the faces of the convention managers when I showed up. In the first place, I guess they expected to see a black person, but they certainly didn't expect to see a black woman. I don't know if there's any black women in convention operations today, dealing directly with hotel and convention bureau managers. But it proved very interesting and very fascinating work, and I made a number of friendships with some of these convention managers in the hotels around the country. I know today, that I could go into some of these hotels now and have hotel courtesies because I'm known to them. And when I retired, I retired as director of conferences. That was my last job.
Who were your heroes and heroines? You mentioned your family...
Well, one of the greatest things, I think, that happens in the Urban League is that you have an opportunity to meet all kinds of people. And the Urban League has always been an interracial organization, so that during the years I have been with the Urban League, I have met a great number of really unprejudiced, dedicated white people who have helped make the Urban League, because it wouldn't be the Urban League unless it was an interracial organization. I've met a great number of blacks.
Of course, I had met Mrs. Mary McLeod Bethune first when she was on the board at the Urban League. She was an Urban League board member for a number of years, but my relationship with her developed during the NYA. Of course, the National Youth Administration, the NYA, was one of the alphabet letters set up during the pre-World War II years, and there was what was called the division of youth affairs of the NYA, and Mrs. Bethune was in charge of that. They set up an advisory committee for New York and Long Island, and the director of Negro affairs for New England, New York and Long Island was Guichard Parris. This was just before he came into the Urban League. He asked me to serve on the advisory committee, this NYA advisory committee for this area. I did have contact with Mrs. Bethune, and I admired her a great deal, and had an opportunity to contribute whatever I might have acquired in the guidance field to the NYA or activities in this area. Then when we started our career conference program, of course, we asked Mrs. Bethune if we could have one down at Bethune-Cookman. She by then had retired, but she was on the campus. She was living there as a president emeritus. I think Dr. Moore was president. So one of the career﻿22
AT: (cont.) conferences we had at Bethune-Cookman was, I think, one of the best we had, and Mrs. Bethune spoke at the meeting. I had my picture taken with her. She was a collector of elephants. We had a picture taken on the lawn, in front of one of her elephants. It was a very moving kind of thing, to have the association with Mrs. Bethune.
I think all of the people with whom I worked in the Urban League—T. Arnold Hill, Lester Granger, Eugene Kinckle Jones, Whitney Young—they motivated me, too, or I wouldn't have stayed there as long as I did. But I had their encouragement and motivation and support of what I was doing. And as I said, all the years I was there, I was pretty free to do almost anything I wanted to do in connection with program.
CG" Each of those people that you worked under, what was their special achievement that you noticed working under... starting with Eugene Kinckle Jones
and Lester Granger?
^■T: Mr. Jones was of the old school, but he was a determined kind of person, and he was kind of... taskmaster. You couldn't be sick and work for Mr. Jones. He had no sympathy with anybody who was ill. I remember that very well. You really had to toe the line with Mr. Jones.
He brooked no foolishness. Granger was very fond of young people. This is probably due to his work before at the Bordentown Industrial School out in Bordentown, New Jersey. And Granger always stayed young himself and was always very sympathetic. I know during...part of the problem, you know, during the depression years, was the fact that we didn't get paid. There were many payless pay days, both during the Jones era and the Granger era. I remember one time when Mr. Jones was executive, and that was in the thirties, there was no money to pay, and Mr. Jones went and mortgaged his home so he'd have enough money to pay the staff at Christmastime. I know that during the Granger episode, if you were ever broke and had no money, Granger would always lend staff money, personally, to tide them over. Granger had a great sense of humor which Jones didn't have. Granger had a sense of humor.
T. Arnold Hill had a great sense of humor, and he was a very easy person to work with.	I think for his time, he was a little ahead of his time,
because he envisioned a great deal for Negro workers that has come to pass, that people had a hard time believing would ever come to pass during his day and time. He used to write a monthly column for Opportunity magazine, labor column in Opportunity magazine- and some of the things that he forecast that the people found it hard to believe at that time really did come to pass. Elmer Carter, who was the editor of Opportunity when I came here — I formed a very warm personal friendship with Elmer Carter and his wife, Thelma, and we were friends long after he left the Urban League.
I knew Whitney Young. As I say, when he first came into the Urban League, he came from a local Urban League in Saint Paul, and was the industrial and vocational guidance secretary, so that I knew him first almost as a coworker. He later became my boss.	Whitney had a great sense of humor
and a great feeling for people, and there was quite a difference. As I say, I only have been associated with Vernon Jordan, not as a full staff﻿(cont.) person, but as a consultant. Vernon was a completely different kind of person from any of the others. He's a much younger person and I couldn't really say that I've had the association with him that I've had with the others over a prolonged period of time, but I think Vernon came along with a personality at the time when he was needed, too. It seems that during these various eras the right person was right there in the job.
One of the other things I forgot to mention. There is a national professional association, years ago, which was called the National Vocational and Guidance Association. It is now called the American Personnel and Guidance Association. But it was composed of professionals in the vocational guidance field, and there were chapters on college campuses for graduate students. So at Dr. Kitson's urging, when I was doing my graduate work, I joined the campus chapter at Columbia. And then when I graduated, I joined the New York chapter and I was active in the Vocational Guidance Association for a number of years. I was a member of the board of trustees of the New York Vocational Guidance Association and a member of the board of trustees of the National Vocational Guidance Association. I don't remember the dates. This was in the fifties. One of the interesting things about the National Vocational Guidance Association, they used to meet in major cities around the country. They also had segregated chapters. When I got into the National Vocational and Guidance Association and realized this, I began a fight to see if we couldn't eliminate these segregated chapters. Because as the years go on, more and more blacks were taking vocational guidance, there were more black counselors and so forth, and teachers, but they were in these I remember especially the Baltimore chapter. I'll never forget one of the conventions in Atlantic City, New Jersey. I had a few white friends and we decided we would set up a campaign to try and eliminate the segregated chapters. But we had a little political ploy, that I was to get up and make a proposal and then I would be backed by these white people—not the blacks but the whites—who had helped make the proposal. And it took a couple of years. We finally were able to abolish the chapters. Another time...they met in Atlantic City a lot, but then they also met in some other places, and come to find out in New Orleans they set a meeting, and the hotels would not accept the blacks. So here again we started a campaign not to meet in any city that would not accept the black members? and we were able to get that through. As in the Urban League, you can't do this job alone. You have to have some dedicated white people on your side to get some of these things accomplished. So that's why I've always continued to believe in interracial activities, just like some of the people who were presidents of the Urban League. Lloyd Garrison, the great-grandson of William Lloyd Garrison, the abolitionist, was an Urban League president for a number of years, and he's another one of the people that I've found to be a very unprejudiced and dedicated kind of a person. Do you have some other questions
Oh yes. I want to go back a bit and ask you, what was it about your parents or your family, that your parents made sure you got a good education? It was in the days when women didn't get good educations all the time, and black women specifically.﻿24
AT: We were not rich, we were not poverty stricken, we were poor. But we always had books in the house. Now part of this had to do with the fact that my grandfather was a printer, he printed books. My mother typeset the books. They loved books and reading. As a child we were given books, we had books in the house, we'd go to the public library. I think I've had a public library card since I could read, and every Saturday we'd go to the library and get books. In fact, I still...Saturday is my day to get books from the public library. We loved to read, all of us loved to read. My mother and father believed in education although they never saw their way that they would be able to send me to college, so I had to pay my way through. I worked and paid my own tuition to college, except for that first year. When I finished Simmons, I wanted my sister to go to Simmons and she was interested...My sister Gertrude. She's twelve years younger than I am. She was interested in studying nursing, so she applied to Simmons College School of Nursing. They wrote back and told her they were very sorry, but none of the affiliated schools of nursing would take blacks. They would take her at Simmons to study for two years, but they could not guarantee she would get in a hospital, because after two years students go into hospital training. So my sister lost her interest in nursing, but she decided she'd go to Simmons anyway into the School of Social Work. So she registered at Simmons. Now we're still in the same position. My father and mother wanted us to go to school, but they could not pay tuition, so I sent my sister to Simmons, and when she finished Simmons, the Urban League was offering—had a fellowship program for students who wanted to study social work. Well, I had applied for graduate study, but they wouldn't give me a fellowship because they said, we do not give employees... So my sister applied for a fellowship and was awarded a fellowship, and studied at the University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work under Dr. Francis Tyson.
My brothers never wanted to go to college. Both became automobile mechanics, and my younger brother operated his own gasoline and service station for a number of years. His daughter, my younger brother's daughter, I told her I would like her to go to Simmons. But she didn't want to go to Simmons, so she went to Bridgewater to study to become a teacher—Bridgewater State Normal School. She stayed there two years and didn't like it, and transferred to Simmons. Well, I helped her finish school, so she graduated from Simmons, so three of us have been Simmons graduates.
One of the other things I forgot to mention. There existed a long time ago an organization called the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses, because the nurses could not belong to the American Nurses' Association. The motivating force behind the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses was a nurse named Mabel Keaton Staupers.
CG: Oh, you wouldn't have her address, would you? Let me ask that to you later.
Now Mabel Keaton Staupers worked for the Tuberculosis Association and
set up the first tuberculosis clinic here in Harlem with the New York Urban
League many, many years ago. She formed a Citizens Committee for the
National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses, and she asked me if I
would be on that committee. So I joined that committee, and this organization
was in the business of trying to integrate into the American Nurses Association.﻿25
AT: (cont.) They were trying to get girls during World War II to become
navy and army nurses and what all and what not. And at that time, of course, in the city of New York, in the forties, one could not get into a hospital unless you were admitted by your own physician; and there were no black physicians in any of the proprietary hospitals in the city of New York. They were in city hospitals, but they weren't in New York Hospital, Columbia Presbyterian, nothing —no nurses, no doctors, no nothing So this Citizens Committee decided we'd make a study and find out what the situation was, and since I was in the personnel and guidance field, I was chairman of this little subcommittee. We made a study of the New York City hospitals and found an appalling situation insofar as nurses were concerned. And the committee started a campaign. Well, to make a long story short, the war was coming on, so finally the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses was merged with the American Nurses Association. It's now out of existence, but it took a long, steady fight, and Mrs. "Staupers led that fight. Mrs. Staupers now has, of course...is in her eighties, mid-eighties, she must be 84, 85. She lives in Washington, D.C., with her sister, and I'm in touch with her off and on.

That's good, because we kept sending letters to New York to her and they kept coming back.
I'll give you her address.
Okay. Do you remember about what year this was? Again, I... In the forties. Right before the war.
Because there were navy nurses and army nurses, and it was in the forties. Yes, Mrs. Staupers can tell you very interesting... She has written a book which you ought to...you ought to get her book. No Time for Prejudice, yes,
Have you read it? No. But I know of it.
AT: So that's one of the other things that in talking I neglected to tell you about the...
You were involved in that?
Yes...National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses.
Because there are no references to...[inaudible] job of referencing black women's organizations and specifically the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses is not...at all.
Should be.
Yes. I'm noticing these chunks that are missing, now that I'm attuned to...﻿26
AT: I think May Chinn worked with us, Dr. May Chinn, who is now doing her own autobiography, one of the first black physicians in around here in New York City. I've forgotten where she went to medical school, but she was one of the first...I might as well give you these addresses now. [interruption]
CG: What was your experience and contact with the black church? I know you
mentioned you went to church in Norwood, but you said there was just a...
AT: When I went to church in Norwood, I went to the Universalist church-7-it' s now Universalist-Unitarian church-r-and as a child I sang in the choir, participated in, you know, youth groups and all that kind of stuff. My first association with the black church was when I went to Springfield to work for Reverend DeBerry. And of course he was a black minister, but he had a Congregational church, so that the Congregational church, the black Congregational church, was no different than the white Congregational church. It was a staid, conservative... it had no emotional appeal whatsoever. When I came to New York, I was attracted to the Church of the Master, particularly because of Reverend James H. Robinson. ' I went there, and here again, in the Presbyterian church—I've never been associated with an emotional kind of a church, like the Baptist or the Methodist church— and I did go to the Presbyterian church and worked with Jim Robinson and his African group. I did volunteer work there, Crossroads Africa, when he was working with that group.	I've known Father Johnson at St.
Martin's personally, because of the church, but I have had very little church time in my adult years.
CG: What kind of perspective did being a black female give you?
AT: See, I don't consider... it's hard for me to think of myself in terms of being a black female, to start off with. I was the first woman in the Urban League movement to acquire professional status because all of the women in the Urban League when I first came in were secretaries. And as I said, I moved up from being a secretary. I don't think it had anything to do with being a woman or not being a woman. It was because I had a certain kind of training to meet a need, and was able to do something in the Urban League.	I don't think any other professional woman came along
in the National Urban League until late forties, early fifties, which was a long period of time. Now there were some local women executives in the local Urban League, head of the local, but in the national office I can't really put my finger on the first professional who came in as professional status. I think it was Betty Whaley, who came in as a director of community services. I had never felt threatened by any of the males who were professionals, because I either supported them or was on a level with them. And of course, I've never held my tongue about anything I felt, or failed to express my conviction —even to the executive, if I felt something, and felt it was important to the welfare of the organization or for the people for whom I was concerned and the program I was operating. So that I've never felt, especially anything in terms of being a black woman...it's a very difficult thing to answer now when they talk about this feminist movement and women. I have no interest in that.﻿27
CG: How do you view it, because obviously you had a very different experience from many of the other women who...
AT: I don't know how to answer that, really. I have always been accepted as
an individual and I don't think there has been any prejudice against me in the Urban League because I'm a woman.

Did you ever get a chance to travel overseas'
Personally, yes. Very recently I went to Europe, '71. But that was a personal trip, vacation. And I've been to the West Indies, that was a visit.
CG: Did the West Indies have any effect on your perspective at all? AT: No.
What other groups do you belong to, that you're active in... I don't belong to groups.
You don't. Are you still active with your sorority?
AT: Well, let me back up. When you said women, I don't like women's organizations.
Tell me about it.
I joined the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority as a student and after I finished school and came down here, I joined a graduate chapter, but I found it was too competitive, too divisive, and I withdrew.	I've never joined any
women's organization because that was a bad experience for me. When you get with groups of women, there's too much of a tendency to gossip, to do a lot of infighting, and I just don't want any part of it. So I've never joined any women's groups, I've never joined the National Council of Business and Professional Women, I've never joined a bridge club, never played cards.
Did you know in high school that you definitely wanted a career?
No.
No.
A career, I did not know what the word meant, really. Because we had no guidance, no career counseling in high school. But I do think that, here, my grandfather taught, my mother taught, Auntie Taylor taught, these various people taught. I had a pleasant childhood as a child, we went down to Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard Island, which now is not anything like it used to be. It's a social center now, but we were part of the Oak Bluffs tradition.﻿28
CG: Can you tell me a little about the Oak Bluffs tradition and what that meant?
AT: Well, the center, which was Cottage City at one time and then changed its name to Oak Bluffs, was set up as a Methodist camp meeting and in the center of Oak Bluffs was a camp meeting ground, which later became the tabernacle. And Methodist ministers and their wives would come down there in the summer for camp meetings, and they built their little summer cottages in a circle around the tabernacle. You would find these little gingerbread cottages all around down in the downtown area of Oak Bluffs. Why they settled on Oak Bluffs and Martha's Vineyard, I do not know. But up on the hill, traditionally—it's a separate community, up the hill near the schoolhouse—was a community of colored people who worked for, as maids and so forth, Methodist ministers' families. There was no sleeping for them at the camp meeting site, so they had their little cottages. My grandmother, my mother's mother, had a little cottage there and her aunt, Auntie Taylor that I mentioned before, had another little cottage. She brought the Cambridge Hand Laundry to Oak Bluffs in the summer, because the Harvard students were awayj school was closed. She did hand laundry for camp meeting people. So that my mother as a child came down there. When her mother died, she inherited—she and her sister, my aunt—inherited this little cottage. So my mother came down to Oak Bluffs in the summer and my first visit there...I was born in January and in June, six months old, I was down at Oak Bluffs. And we used to come down there every summer until the world war came around.
CG:
CG: AT:
CG: AT:
World War I?
World War I. And there were submarines off the coast, German submarines were off the coast.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Except for the natives, the natives stayed on the island, people deserted the island, and they didn't come back.	I had a very pleasant, happy
childhood in the summer at Oak Bluffs. Then after the war, the people came back to Oak Bluffs, but it was after the war that a lot of the white people who were not the ministers down here, but the others who had these big homes and cottages up on the hill, began to sell their homes and that's when the middle-class blacks began to buy some of these homes. I remember a doctor from New York was one of the first people to buy a house and I think he paid two thousand dollars—probably you couldn't replace it now for fifteen or twenty. And then gradually over the years it came to be a summer resort for New York and Boston black people. That's the background of Oak Bluffs.
See, I never knew about that.
I went back there a few years ago, about five years ago, and of course all this is changed, the house is gone. I learned to iron, Auntie Taylor taught me how to iron and she used to pay me two cents for handkerchiefs or something like that, for ironing handkerchiefs. I learned how to iron shirts from her, because she knew how to iron.﻿29
CG: I never knew that about Oak Bluffs. I have these...
AT: There used to be a narrow-gauge railroad that ran along the coast from Oak Bluffs to Edgartown. When I was a kid I used to see the tracks. Of course, the train had stopped running by then.
CG: That's another thing I wanted to ask you about. What is your opinion,
perspective, sort of long view of the black middle class. You mentioned the black middle class, its interests...
AT: Well, I still live in Harlem, you know. When I came to New York there
was no place else to live. When I came to Harlem, it was the first time I had ever been in an area concentrated with all-black living, because all through college I was living at home, still in Norwood. When I went to Springfield, of course I was in the middle-class black area of Springfield, but it wasn't all black because there were whites around. So when I came to Harlem, it was the first time I had ever lived in an all-black neighborhood. One day I realized the only white people 1 ever talked to... When I came to New York, all the people I saw were the few board members that I ran into, students at college, at Columbia.	I was living in
a ghetto. The first year I came, I roomed. The second year, I had an apartment with a friend of mine and then the third year I moved on to Striver's Row in a private house.
CG: Which streets now are Striver's Row?
AT: 139th Street, between 7th and 8th Avenues. I lived with Mr. and Mrs.
Harry Austin. Bernia Austin was one of the what might be called social arbiters of Harlem, and I lived there for about ten years, then I moved to the Dunbar Apartments at 150th and 7th, and then from there I moved to Riverton. The Metropolitan Life Insurance opened Riverton, '46, and I moved there in '47. I've lived there ever since. So I've always lived in Harlem. I've been in Harlem...when I first came, as I said, which was the tail end of the Harlem Renaissance, but the Lafayette Theater was operating then and the night clubs. I used to go to the Lafayette Theater. I never went to the Apollo. But I would go to the Lafayette Theater.
When I first came to New York, the Fifth Avenue buses were ten cents. The subways were five, but the buses were ten cents. The number 4 bus which went up Riverside Drive, the number 3 bus which went up St. Nicholas Avenue, the number 15 which went to Long Island, would not pick up black people on the street. If you signaled the bus, it would never pick you up. The only bus you could get on was the number 2 bus, unless you started at the end of the line. Because there's no blacks living in those areas, no blacks up on Riverside Drive, and no blacks on Saint Nicholas Avenue area, and so the only bus you could get on was the number 2 which went through Harlem. Of course, that has changed. I used to use the el coming to work, because the Urban League was on Broadway and 26th Street. From there we moved to 48th Street, then to 52nd Street, and later to this building at 62nd Street. But 7th Avenue was a beautiful avenue, one of the widest streets in New York City, and it is true as you've read, and probably other people have﻿30
AT: (cont.) told you, that if you walked out on 7th Avenue, you'd see all your friends. It was a meeting place, nice place to be. Go up to the Lafayette Theater, you would see all your friends, you knew the people who were in the shows, and you'd go see Porgy and Bess, things like that. You knew the actors and actresses, Rose McClendon, for example. Bessie—what's her name?—Bearden (the mother of the famous artist Romare Bearden) was taking tickets; she was in the ticket office at the Lafayette Theater. It was a nice place to be. Harlem was at its height. There were actors' groups and literary groups. At the 135th Street public library they had a theater downstairs, a place where you'd see your friends, meet people. It was a nice place to be, fabulous. I used to come to New York when I was in college. My first time I ever came to New York I think was 1925. I think I first came to New York in 1925, although I didn't live here until 1930.
CG: The other thing that I'd like to know from you, because I've found in my travels that there are a lot of younger people who think that the black middle class has done them in.
AT: Oh, well yes. You did ask me about the black middle class: What do I
think of the black middle class? Well, you've got to have... There will always be a middle class, I don't care whether it's black, white, or whatever, there will always be a middle class.	I think many people over the years
have risen from a lower group, whatever you may call them...lower group, who have come out of poverty or have been very poor and become educated, and...a better economic position and make more money, and they are in this so-called middle class. Some of them forget where they came from, and others will never forget where they came from. But the middle class, whether we like it or not, seems to be the aspiration... Everybody aspires to be part of the middle class, I think. Now whether they reach there or not, you don't reach there unless you make some effort to get there, unless you'do something that's positive. And I do believe that the middle-class people have an obligation to try and help others to get where they are, or to even go further than they. We've always said in our guidance work with the young people that part of the motivation of young people is to make them improve whatever their present situation is, and get the education and training to find a better life for themselves and for their children... and finding that better life means moving up from where you are to some other place.
I haven't deserted Harlem. Maybe I would if I could afford to move somewhere else, but I can't afford to live anywhere else.	I don't feel afraid
in Harlem. I don't go out anywhere at night, because I don't go out by myself, but I'm not afraid of living in Harlem. A lot of people say they're afraid'to live there, but New York City is practically the same everywhere in this day. But when I see a lot of the youngsters on the street and on the public transportation... The schools are not giving young people what they need today. So that some of them will remain forever in the under class, and some of them will continue to be dependent upon public assistance because they've been brought up on public assistance and their children and their grandchildren have followed them.﻿31
At the end of the Harlem Renaissance—you're really one of the first people I've interviewed who's actually talked about it. You know, people may have lived through it, but you knew people, you mentioned all sorts of names and things, and you said you've lived in Harlem all this time. What happened afterwards? During the depression and afterwards you read things by Richard Wright, he talks about the Communist Party in Harlem among the intellectuals. Did you ever see any of that, did you ever have the chance to observe any of that?
A-T: I don't know anything about the Communist Party in Harlem. But you see, one of the things, Harlem was contained because you could not go downtown and go to a hotel, you couldn't go downtown and go to a restaurant. I remember Channing Tobias who was head of the Negro YMCA division. At that time Horn and Hardart had a restaurant in addition to their nickel and dime service at the Automat. Dr. Tobias was discriminated against in a Horn and Hardart restaurant. Well, you just could not go downtown and walk in a restaurant to eat. You couldn't go downtown and go to a hotel. Well, after the war, this broke. So that there was a dispersal of people. And people in Harlem who had the money could go downtown and go in a restaurant and go into the theater or whatever. So this had something to do with the change. And it was just dispersed. And they were beginning to develop, now, white friendships and visit their friends downtown. I would have friends come uptown, but I wouldn't... Nowadays you find very few white people in Harlem, very few. And of course a lot of the middle-class blacks have moved out in the suburbs, into Westchester or wherever. And then the community itself is not as beautiful as it was. When you go block after block and see the devastation, you go up 7th Avenue and all those beautiful buildings are gone, the trees have gone, the streets are dirty. One time you could walk from 125th to 135th or 145th or whatever on 7th Avenue and you would see no dirt, no poverty, no drunks, no drug addicts, people well dressed, just out on the street, strolling. That's gone, and that was part of the Harlem Renaissance. The places like little restaurants—Craig's Restaurant up on the hill, where you'd go on a Sunday morning, there's where the middle-class blacks went to eat dinner Sunday. It's gone. It's just different. But as I say, it's hard to remember some of these places and people and names, unless you have some specific, you know, people or names that you would like to ask me about.
CG: Now you mentioned that you knew Countee Cullen, and you mentioned that you knew, actually, quite a few people, people that you met through school. And one of the reasons I asked you about the middle class was that many people don't realize how much the middle class depend on one another to sort of keep back some of the pains of...
AT: Yes. Well now, you see these people that I met...The other thing that's interesting, a lot of the people who were young when I was young and who were in school, where could they go? They could not find jobs and the only jobs they could find were teaching jobs at black schools in the South. Where could they go but to the South to teach school? So later when I started traveling to these schools and colleges, I'd be going to the campus, look up, look in a class, and here's somebody teaching who I knew as a student going to Harvard or Smith or wherever it was years before. 'Cause that's where they ended up.﻿32
AT: (cont.) Speaking of...sometimes the people fail to understand what we were trying to do in the guidance program in the Urban League. Now, an excellent example of that is—there was a fellow named Curtis who was older than I am, because he finished MIT—I did not know him as a student, but he was a graduate of MIT, got his bachelor's—went down to Tuskegee and taught, went back to MIT and got his master's degree or Ph.D. or something in engineering and went back to Tuskegee. There was nowhere else he could go, because he couldn't be employed in industry at that time. When we took the career conference to Tuskegee and met with the faculty before, to talk to them about what we wanted to do, Curtis was very scornful of what we were attempting to do. He said there was no point in guiding these youngsters into thinking they could get jobs in the big corporations because it wasn't possible. "Look at me, I've got all the degrees in the world from one of the best schools of engineering, and I'm down here teaching." We tried to show him that we've got to prepare these youngsters because times are changing. Well, we took the conference down there and actually when some of our consultants were there, he said to the students it was all right for the Urban League to tell you these things, but it isn't going to happen. And one of the groups that we took there, one of the consultants we took was from RCA, Radio Corporation of America. After we left, he made a contact with this very man, the Radio Corporation man, who offered him a job.	He left Tuskegee and went to RCA in Camden, New Jersey, and
stayed there for twenty-five or more years.	When he retired from RCA,
he had one of the highest and best paying jobs in the Radio Corporation of America.
CG: AT CG AT
AT:
And he was so scornful. And he was scornful. And times changed for him. Times changed for him.
What kind of changes have you seen? How are things different now from when you first started? Make believe I don't have any idea. [laughs]
Well, I explained in one of the pamphlets I wrote that in 1930, of 534 major occupational groupings in the United States census, I think blacks were employed in all but four. Even if there was only one black in a job, which was reason enough to believe that there could be more in all categories if we motivated the youngsters to prepare for this. If they wanted to be a chemist, then go ahead and be a chemist. We dug out stories that we could find and put it in a little booklet in The Color Line Series, called "They Made It," of people who even if there's one chemist or one electrical engineer, whatever, to show the youngsters that there was somebody in the occupation. And it came to pass.
Now when I first came to New York, they were getting ready to build the Eighth Avenue subway. They had the Seventh Avenue, the Lexington Avenue; the Eighth Avenue subway was not built, it was in the process of being built. And the New York Urban League and the National Urban League together﻿33
AT: (cont.) were working to try and get the city of New York to hire blacks to work on the subway and, when the subway was built, to help them be motormen and conductors. It was a long, hard struggle, and we recruited people. Finally, when the subway opened, they hired two black motormen and now most of motormen, and conductors, and in other jobs on the subway are black.
But the telephone industry, another example. Now the New York Telephone Company, we conducted—and I say we, it was the industrial relations department under Julius Thomas—had what we call a pilot placement program, and we were placing young blacks in jobs that were never held before by Negroes, and we called them pilots. A lot of these people got training during the war, in war industry. One of the most interesting stories was the whole telephone company situation. When the New York and the National Urban League tackled that together...because there were no telephone operators and there were no blacks employed in any lines or anything in the telephone company. We started recruiting jobs for telephone operators, and we got girls, and recruited them. We started with a large group—four or five hundred we recruited—we counseled them, we guided them, told them what to do in a job interview and all that. Finally we got down to a small few, and they were sent to the telephone company and they hired a couple. That was the beginning of the use of blacks in the telephone company. It started right here in New York.
CG: This was after the war, wasn't it?
AT: This was after the war. One of the pictures that I used to illustrate an article showed a young black girl placing the first dial-operated, longdistance telephone call between New York and Los Angeles. When they instituted the new dial system, it was a black girl who was one of the first recruits. But when I came to New York, you didn't see them. It's a pleasure to pick up magazines and see all these blacks as models there are now. That's another field that we worked in, to get girls to go to school, modeling school and apply for these modeling jobs. A lot of them wanted to model.
When I first came here, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company was across Madison Square Park. We were at Broadway and 26th; the Metropolitan Life was across the park at 25th and Madison, and at noontime, if you'd go out in the park and sit down^-a lot of people in the spring and summer used to eat their lunch in the park. The girls from the life insurance company were all white. Of course, one of the things that started	after
the war was the New York State Fair Employment Practices Law which went into effect in '45. Anticipating the passage of the law, we began working with some of these firms. They began recruiting stenographers, and clerks, and typists, and everything in the insurance field, and the Metropolitan Life was one of the first... And after that, between 1945 and 1950, you'd go out during lunch period and see many blacks, both male and female. You would see [inaudible] change. One of the things that happened to Urban League staff people themselves, once the FEPC was passed—who was the first Fair Employment Practices commissioner?—Elmer Carter, formerly editor of Opportunity magazine, became commissioner of the New York State Commission Against Discrimination. Because the Urban League people had the kinds of experience that was needed in the government.﻿34
CG: I was going to say, how much did the Urban League have to do with that law, that Fair Employment Practices Law?
AT: of course, we don't operate in...We're nonpartisan, but we go to testify when called upon, to testify to the condition of blacks or the needs of whatever it may be. And many, many Urban League people were employed by the government because they had the background and experience they need. But the whole picture, the whole picture, when you walk in the streets even now downtown, there are blacks everywhere, because they're working down there, they're working. That wasn't the picture a long time ago. Many blacks never went below 125th Street...never went below 125th Street. It just wasn't something they felt comfortable about—they were treated as if they weren't wanted.
CG: What was your reaction to the sixties?
AT: The sixties was very exciting, very exciting, because I was in complete sympathy with what the young people were trying to do, and that's... During the sixties we began to get young people more involved in the Urban League. We set a standard for having at least twenty-five percent of the boards at the Urban Leagues young people thirty years and younger. And of course I had been working with young people in this guidance program over the years, but we established a youth program. I worked closely with Ronald Brown who was in charge of the student program we had then, and the Urban League was active in the March on Washington.
CG: You mentioned an award that you received that was named in your honor
for service in the Urban League. What other awards did you receive and how do you feel about them?
AT:
CG:
CG:
AT:
Well, I got an award from the New York Vocational Guidance Association, that was in '50, for contributions to the guidance field.	I got an
award from the National Vocational Guidance Association for outstanding contributions to the field of guidance. I got the Simmons College Alumnae Award in 1971 for an outstanding member of the alumnae. That's enough. Incidentally, I'm going back to my alumnae reunion in June, fifty.
Oh, it'll be your fiftieth reunion next June?
AT: And Ellen Miller and I will both be there. I had a note from her the other day. She's the other person who was in my class. We'll both be there. I've heard from a couple of my classmates. As I said, I had a few friends in the class among the white girls, and I've heard from a couple of them. We'll all be there.
That was another thing. Everything that you've done has been interracial. What were your feelings in the sixties toward groups that began to espouse —I don't know--separatism?
Oh, well, I don't believe in it, don't believe in it. I mean we can never achieve anything as separatists. It's just absolutely impossible. Because 1 believe within my lifetime —of course, my lifetime isn't much more—but﻿35
AT: (cont.) I don't believe that blacks will ever be in power anywhere, anywhere... impossible. Now, people can talk about the fact that the world has more darker-skinned people, but it won't happen in this country, because we do not control the seats of power. It's very interesting that money is now in the hands of the Arabians—the wealth that is now being displayed by the Saudi Arabians. Very interesting, and it's disturbing a great many people. I overheard a woman say one time something about going to London. And she said, "I always stay at the Dorchester, but now the Dorchester is owned by Arabians, Arabian oil owns Dorchester. I can't stay there." But the civil rights movement in the sixties never would have succeeded if it had been an all-black movement. We had too many whites on our side.
CG: You know, it goes back to what you talked about earlier, wanting to have this resolution passed to stop the guidance counselors from...and doing it in concert. That was important.
AT: Another person that I remember meeting when she was around New York was Margaret Walker [Alexander]. That was in later years, though, that was in the late forties, I think, early fifties, and Margaret was in New York. Right after she wrote For M^ People.
CG: What do you think are going to be the problems that blacks face? Priorities in terms of change? You mentioned earlier the...
AT: The problems would be to the extent...I don't see the problems changing.
They may change in quantity, but the problem is still going to be getting training for jobs and careers, and being able to get an education, being able to make it, that's all. My hours now, I work from nine to four. I hate to get on the bus and run into the schoolchildren, because the conduct of the little black children coming out of school and riding on the public transportation is terrible. They're rude; their language is terrible. I see some of the girls, thirteen, fourteen, smoking cigarettes on the bus, everything. They don't have training. They don't get it at home; they don't get it at school. Where they'll end up, I don't know. But I think years ago, there was better home training than is available now. But how can they have better home training when their parents — they come from broken homes—their parents are discriminated against, discouraged, ill, poor. So I think the problems are the same.
CG:
One other thing. When you were working...when you retired you said you retired as director of conferences. But during the period you went from secretary to special assistant in charge of vocational guidance...
AT: Oh, I had all kinds of titles. I started out as a secretary, and moved
up once I got my guidance training. In the process of getting that training...
I carried a secretarial title until after I got my degree, although I was doing the guidance work, and I had a professional title from then on. Is that what you...
CG: One of the things I wanted to ask you was during that period, what was a typical day like with you?﻿36
A typical day? Yes.
I have all my diaries—see up on the shelf there, those red diaries, '75, '76, '77? I have all the diaries that I've ever had since 1932. They are home in my closet. I put them up there because I said, "Some day I'm going over them." But a typical day—now when I was going to school, I used to come to work at eight because I left at four to go to school. I'd usually get in a five o'clock class. But a typical day! When I was doing secretarial work and guidance together, I would come in, I would open the mail, I would take dictation, I would transcribe dictation, I would make appointments for myself or for Mr. Hill, I would do research if I needed factual information to work with.	I always was full of ideas. I would
whip out ideas and memoranda. Many ideas went in the wastebasket, many were thrown out, many were too ambitious, and many were accepted.
What were the ones that were too ambitious?
Oh, all kinds of ideas. I can't be specific, but...well, bringing up these radio programs and all the ideas I had of going out to get these stars of stage, screen, and radio, because they were names that would attract, and just'something that I thought the Urban League should be doing that I put on paper. They would say, no, we don't have.the money for it, it's too ambitious, or we can't do it now. Then I would do interviewing, so if I had any one of those diaries in front of me for those middle years, I could tell you the people who were looking for jobs. I served on a lot of committees, that's one of the things I was on. I was on the committee for the trade school up in Harlem, YWCA Trade School; I was on the committee for young workers for the United States Department of Labor. I went to conferences and meetings; I was on the Women in Radio group. After I wrote that first radio script, I said, "Maybe I need to learn something about radio writing other than what I can get in a book." So I went down to NYU and took a summer course...had to go to class in radio writing at seven o'clock in the morning before I went to work. I would have meetings to go to, and in the middle years, in the forties, the book was full of those meetings with the advisory committee on the nursing group. I went to a lot of those meetings. Then I would do a lot of counseling, across-the-desk counseling with people who came in for vocational guidance which...we weren't supposed to be doing individual counseling, but we had to do it. These people would come in looking for a job, didn't know where to go, didn't know where to turn, didn't know the resources in the community. I did an awful lot of writing of as I said these little booklets, guides, what to do... compiled bibliographies of all kinds, did a lot of reading, and participated in staff meetings when the staff would get together and talk about programs. I had a vocational guidance committee, one of the chairmen of my committee was Mrs. Marietta Tree when she was on the board of the Urban League. She was chairman of the guidance committee at one time. Dr. Kenneth Clark was chairman another time.	I'd meet with the committee. A typical
day was filled from...all day long, doing something, doing something.
What do you consider your most outstanding achievement?﻿37
There isn't anything I consider my most outstanding achievement. I think my greatest contribution has been what I may have done to motivate some people,who were young people at that time, to keep on going or to choose a career. I now run into people who say, don't you remember, you advised me to do something, or you suggested to do something, or you helped me get my job here and there and the other? Over a period of many years I had something to do with the lives of a lot of people. But as to anything the most outstanding, I just don't know. I think I can truthfully say, and I think that's the thing that Whitney Young recognized when he decided to set up the Ann Tanneyhill Award, that in one's day-to-day work, you're working to earn your living, but in that day-to-day work, you go above and beyond that.	If you have the dedication and commitment to whatever
you're doing at the organization for which you're working, that can be an inspiration and motivation for other people. So that is what I guess I'm all about. Of course, I've developed some friendships over the years, and of course when you get along to my age, many of the friendships you've developed and the people you associated with are no longer here. You can just look back and remember what those days were like. I've started, but I don't suppose I'll ever get it all together. I've saved a lot of stuff over the years, and I have a lot of material I suppose I should put together some day in scrapbook form...I don't know. People say why don't I write, but I... A lot of people tell me I'm too self-effacing, don't want to give myself credit for anything, but I don't know if my autobiography would be of particular interest. Maybe just get this on tape and put it somewhere for other people to refer to, would be as far as I'll ever get. But I've enjoyed every moment of it. Some people say, "Well, how could you stay in the Urban League this long?" Because I've found the Urban League to be a fascinating place in which to be, and I've felt that I could make some kind of contribution, and that I believe in the Urban League cause.
Plus when you talk about the early times, when you first	discovered
your fellow blacks, you wrote to the NAACP and to the Urban League and then you looked them over and you chose, you chose well.
My first association with the NAACP was my first year in Springfield. The NAACP had a national conference in Springfield and I met some of the NAACP people at that time—Robert Bagnall, Walter White, George Schuyler, James Weldon Johnson. During that time I met those people, and then after the years being in New York, you know, they were on the scene and I would be places... I suppose, from the beginning in the Urban League, I never accepted reality, being just a secretary or stenographer. I was into everything. And in my off times I went places and did things where I met a lot of these people. And in Urban League meetings, I was always there for some reason or other, to take some dictation or take notes or hand out something, but I was always there. These people flowed in and out, around and about, and I liked to talk to them, you know. So that's how I met so many people. And there is no doubt that the Urban League was the meeting ground for important people in federal, state, city government, so that in New York you probably met every mayor or every governor who was ever around during those years.﻿38
CG: Did you ever meet any of the presidents?
AT: I met Kennedy, Johnson. I met Lyndon B. Johnson when he was vice-president, not when he was president. And President Carter, of course, I met Jimmy Carter when he was...Carter was here during his campaign,meeting the staff here. Because we had a lot of these candidates in the office to indicate to the staff what they were doing, what they planned to do. And of course people like Ed Brooke, you know, he's the senator from Massachusetts; although I was no longer a resident of Massachusetts, I had known him from a long time. Governor Herbert H. Lehman, Governor Charles Poletti, they were all part of the Urban League. They either spoke for the Urban League at one time or other, had something to do with the Urban League. I think of the old veterans like John W. Davis, who is now...when I first met him, he was president of West Virginia State, and now we just honored him a year ago—not a year ago, a few months ago—College Fund honored him. He was working with the College Fund after he left West Virginia State. All the black college presidents, of course, I have met because we worked with the colleges. Dr. Patterson—Frederick D. Patterson, former president of Tuskegee—is upstairs now with the College Fund, doing things off and on. I see him from time to time. So that the so-called important black people you had to meet if you were in the Urban League...and many of the important white people you had to meet if you were in the Urban League. It was inevitable.
CG: it must have been exciting.
AT: it was exciting.
CG: I think I've asked you all my questions, and the ones that I didn't mention you answered.
I suppose I've forgotten something or failed to say something, or something that might be important that I've just forgotten about. But you know, I wrote down some of these dates...and I think I've covered all of that. I just did that Saturday so that I wouldn't forget some of them.
CG: That was really...
AT: One other thing that is very interesting. When I was...we're going back
to the twenties, now. As I told you, I was working for Mr. Day, even though I was a youngster. He was a recluse and stayed in bed; he wouldn't go out. But he wanted to know what was going on, so he used to send me to observe things and come back and tell him. And I remember 1921 was the—when did the Pilgrims land?
CG: 1620.
1620. So it was 1920, tricentennial of the landing of the Pilgrims. He sent me to Plymouth, and I was so young my mother had to go with me. They had a replica of the Mayflower, and, of course, Plymouth Rock. I saw the pageant, saw the village recreated, I had to come back and tell him everything.﻿39
AT: (cont.) So at one time, when I was in college, I think it was either
'25 or '26, the poet Khalil Gibran was in Boston, reading his poetry, and he sent me to listen to this poetry reading and come back and tell him the... Well, I knew that he, Gibran, was somewhere in Mr. Day's past, but it wasn't clear to me. But I went and met Gibran and heard him read the poetry and came back and told him. So in 1974, I think '74, I got a telephone call from a woman who said her name was Jean Gibran, and she was in Boston. Her husband was named Khalil Gibran and he was the nephew of the poet, and he was doing a book, a biography of his uncle, and wanted to talk to me. I couldn't understand why she wanted to talk to me, and he said the original Khalil Gibran was a protege of Fred Day, and that I was the only living person who knew Fred Day, and wanted to talk to me about it.
So we had long correspondence, and I told her all I knew about Fred Day. And then when they sent me the book after it was written, I found out what the real relationship with Gibran was, that he actually was a protege'. But of course I didn't know it at the time, back in 1925 you know.
CG: You had a fascinating job as a high school student. That was a really fascinating job.
AT: That's right.
CG: And you know, the skills that you did then, you used later to research the observations...
AT'- That's right. And of course that's when I started doing the history of my own family, back in the thirties because the genealogical knowledge... I started doing my own family history. So when Alex Haley came up with this Roots business, it was nothing new to me. And of course I have not gone to Frederick, Maryland, to do my father's family, but I've done as much as I can of my mother's family.	All I've done are the genealogical
tables of my mother's family.
CG: Have you gone past the Canadian experience back before the —
No, I want to go to Nova Scotia to get that documentation, but I think it'll be difficult to find. But I do have third or fourth cousins still up in Nova Scotia. I do want to go to Frederick, Maryland, because I think there'll be some interesting things in my father's family that I'll find there. In fact, one day, one year, when I was living in the Dunbar Apartments, I got a lot of Christmas cards, but they weren't from people I knew, and I said, "Something must be wrong." So I looked in the telephone book and I found out there was another Tanneyhill in the telephone book; so I called this woman up and told her that I had been getting these Christmas cards from people I did not know, and they were probably for her; so she invited me to come down and have tea with her. She was down in the seventies downtown. It had to be before 1945. I told her where I lived and I said, "Before I come down there, I want to let you know I'm colored." She didn't say anything. I went down and had tea with her. Come to find out her husband, who was dead, was from Maryland—not Frederick, but was﻿40
AT: (cont.) from Maryland—and he was a songwriter, and he wrote songs at the turn of the century. Well, that hit something in my mind. My father had some sheet music by a person named Frank Tanneyhill, which he bought because it had the Tanneyhill name on it. He was this woman's husband. So I will have to dig back into the Tanneyhill part of the family. There's some connection here —'got to be, got to be.
I go down to the Cape now in the summer, down into Mashpee, the Indian community. My brother and I bought some land down there, and my brother opened a gas station there in 1956. Gas station and store, and I go down in the summer to help him. I work in the store and so forth. But that's the community where, now...that's split apart by this Indian controversy, you know. But I've been going down there ever since... Of course I've been going down to the Cape and the islands for years and years, but I've been going to Mashpee since '48.
CG: Was the part of Mashpee that you live in involved in the suit as well, or...
AT: Well, the whole town's involved.
CG: The whole town was involved...some areas that weren't.
AT: The whole town. It's very unfortunate, very unfortunate. I cannot think of anything else to tell you, but if something does occur to me as I look at these typed manuscripts, then I'll make some additional notations. Now do you want any materials of any kind, any documentation?
CG: Yes.
CG: I came back to ask you about your religious philosophy and experience.
AT: Well, I don't know whether it's exactly a religious philosophy as much as it is a philosophy for living, and probably that is the same thing. When we were children, I was brought up in the Universalist church, and of course, I don't think in that day and time the Universalist church was very large or had too much of a membership around the country. But as a very small child I remember going to Sunday school and then growing up and singing in the choir. But the philosophy of the Universalist church was based on the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God, and it was not an emotional kind of thing, it was more of the adult, an intellectual sort of religious philosophy. But that was the beginning in my background, that I was brought up to believe in the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God. I suppose throughout my life, it has really influenced me. I belonged to little groups, I joined the Campfire Girls which was led by my Sunday school teacher, and I kept up with that Sunday school teacher I had when I was probably seven or eight years old; I've kept up with her until the time she died. And she lived to be quite an elderly person, and her daughter and I were very close and we still remain friends, although she is in California and I'm out here in the East Coast.﻿41
(cont.) When I came to New York, I had some friends here who belonged to the Congregational church. So I went to the Congregational church for a little while, but I wasn't too pleased with that. And when I was in Springfield, I worked for a Congregational minister, because my first job was with Dr. DeBerry, who was the Urban League secretary, but also head of the St. John's Congregational Church there. Then I tried the Presbyterian church for a little while, but there was something about both the Congregational and Presbyterian that didn't seem to me to be just what I wanted. I went back to my original philosophy, and I just didn't go to church, formally go to church any more, and I haven't until this day. I go in churches—that is, most people do, I suppose, to enter, rest and pray—whatever church may be around or however I may be feeling at a particular time. But as a child my mother's philosophy was that of the Golden Rule and we absorbed that as children. When I was in college, I took a couple of courses in Bible, particularly Bible as literature, and I became familiar with the Bible and I would read the Bible. And one time I just chose to be reading something, and learned a lot of quotations from the Bible that I would use from time to time, especially in my writing. Then a friend of mine got me for a Christmas gift, a subscription to the Daily Word, and I have used the Daily Word, reading not only daily, but whenever I wanted to read, and absorbed the kind of philosophy that you find in Unity. I think really my personal concern for other people, no matter who they might be, and willingness to listen to other people's problems and to try to help other people, and not to offend other people in anything I may say or do, combined with the serenity prayer, which I have on a charm bracelet...you familiar with that? "Lord, give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."
Yes.
And the Saint Francis, "Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace," I think that whole combination is what I live by. I think that explains what might be called my religious philosophy.
One other thing, I might comment...I don't know whether I said that my mother's aunt, my great-aunt, lived with us when I was a child. And I think I did discuss her, because I said she had the Cambridge Hand Laundry...
Yes, yes, and she took students into her house.
And I told you about the group she belonged with, the Cambridge Praying Band?
No, you didn't tell us about the Cambridge Praying Band. She was from Nova Scotia, and... Auntie Taylor, right?﻿42
AT: Auntie Taylor. She was from Nova Scotia; she and her sister, they maintained the Cambridge Hand Laundry, but they belonged to what was called the Cambridge Praying Band.	it was never clear to me as to whether the
group in the Cambridge Praying Band were all friends from Nova Scotia, or whether they were friends that developed during their life in Cambridge. But they used to meet Sunday afternoons and some other night during the week, and sing hymns. Most of the hymns were either Methodist or Baptist hymns, and when she came to live with us, she wanted to continue singing hymns; and I recall when I was in high school, after supper in the evenings sometimes, we'd go into the front parlor and I would play the piano and we would sing hymns. I learned many, many of the Baptist and the Methodist hymns that way.	I think my piano lessons were forced upon me, but
I did love to play hymns, and I learned to play hymns, and I think now the only thing I can play on the piano are some of those old hymns.
CG: Which ones were your favorites?
AT: Oh, I knew them all.
CG: Are there any that stand out in your mind? The ones that you end up humming in the middle of the day?
AT: Now that you ask me suddenly, I probably can't think, but, "Jesus, Lover
of My Soul," "Rock of Ages," "The Old Rugged Cross," "I Came to the Garden," __all of those. So that if I hear them now, I remember most of the words.
CG: You hadn't told me you'd taken piano lessons before.
AT: Oh, I guess...I hated them, so that was probably part of the reason. I
found practicing when I wanted to do other things, when I preferred really to read.., I realize now that that was an error on my part. It's too late to be remedied.
CG: Did you take the lessons in Norwood, or...
AT: Yes. In Norwood, yes.
CG: Another question we wanted to go over again was the question of the
restructure of the Urban League. We had talked about the specific secretaries, but we hadn't talked about the larger organization.
AT: That's one thing I would like to get on the record, because since my
whole life has been in the Urban League ... and in this oral history project you may have one or two other individuals who have been affiliated with the Urban League, I don't know.
CG: i don't know either, I'm not sure.
AT: But the Urban League history is an important history in the development of blacks in America, so I thought I would delineate that history. I've got some dates down here so I won't make a mistake. Back in 1906, 1905, there was a group in New York made up of black women and white women called the National League for the Protection of Colored Women. This group was working﻿43
AT: (cont.) in the behalf of black women who were coming up from the South into the major cities in the North to be employed as domestic workers, and they were being exploited.	This group of women got together to work on
their behalf. At the same time there was another group, mainly men, called the Committee for the Improvement of the Industrial Conditions Among Negroes in New York. This was a New York City-based group and they were doing the same thing for black men who were coming from the South. And then there was a third group that had a little broader interest, not only the jobs that these people were getting, this was called the Committee on Urban Conditions Among Negroes. This was formed in 1909, 1910. The motivating force behind this group was the wife of the president of the Long Island Railroad. The president of the Long Island Railroad at that time was Mr. William H. Baldwin, and he also had a great philanthropic interest in Tuskegee Institute and was on the board of Tuskegee. Mrs. Baldwin was interested in the broader, the living conditions, the economic conditions, the living conditions, of Negroes, as they were called at that time, in the city. And that's where the word urban, the city, came in. There was a young graduate student at Columbia University called Dr. George Edmund Haynes. Mrs. Baldwin was intrigued by some of the studies that he was doing for his master's thesis and doctoral dissertation, and Mrs. Baldwin and Dr. Haynes got together and they're called the cofounders. They felt these three groups were too much; they were all concerned with the same thing. So they got together and persuaded the members of the three groups to consolidate,and they amalgamated in 1910 and 1911 into one group called the National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes. Mrs. Baldwin and Mr. Haynes are called the cofounders of that group, and the first president of the group was Professor Seligman.
CG: Seligman?
AT: yes, Professor E.R.A.—he used the initials—Seligman, at Columbia University. He became the first president and Mrs. Baldwin was on the board and Mr. Haynes was hired as the first executive.	The budget that year was
$8,500, and they started off with this one organization in New York City. And within the next three years they began to move toward helping similar organizations, local, what they called local groups, in a number of cities. But the name, the National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes, was so long, they changed it to the National Urban League and the name has remained the same. They had an identifying logo which had the name, National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes. It was a circular logo, with blind justice in the center and a city back of it with high buildings in the background. That remained the same identifying symbol of the Urban League until ... I've forgotten the year it was changed into two figures, one black and one white, still against the city background. And then the third symbol was changed in the mid-sixties after the March on Washington, to an equality symbol, with two equal bars, and that remains the symbol.
Now during the first three years, between 1910 and 1913, the National Urban League remained here in New York City, and they set up a New York branch. They also put branches in Philadelphia, Saint Louis, Nashville, Baltimore, Memphis, and Louisville; and then the expansion continued from that first national office in New York City with a budget of $8,500 and two staff people, to where we are today, with branches, we call them﻿44
AT: (cont.) affiliates, in 112 cities across the country. We have approximately three thousand full-time staff and thirty thousand volunteers. Volunteers are the board members of the organization who serve on boards and committee. The League has always maintained that the board should be interracial and the National Urban League board and the local boards are all interracial boards. The National Urban League budget today is around four million dollars, and the combined budget of the affiliates is around between sixty and seventy million dollars. Over this period since 1910 to 1972, which is sixty-two years, we've had eleven different presidents.
As I've said, Mr. Seligman was the first president; then Mrs. Baldwin, and she preferred to use her own name, Ruth Standish Baldwin, rather than Mrs. William H. Baldwin; she was the second president.
CG: That's interesting.
AT: The third president was L. Hollingsworth Wood, who was a Quaker. He was on the board of Fisk University, he was interested in education, and he was a supporter of Fisk University. He remained the president longer than any other person, from 1915 to 1941, and it was after that that they started... the bylaws were revised and they had presidents rotate. The fourth president was William H. Baldwin, Jr., Mrs. Baldwin's son, and he is still living, he's in his eighties. Following him was Lloyd K. Garrison, the great-grandson of William Lloyd Garrison, the abolitionist. Now those presidents all had a tradition somewhere within their family for interracial work...
CG: And activism.
AT: Activism in [inaudible]. Then after that the president was Mr. Dowling, Robert W. Dowling. He was a businessman in New York City who owned a lot of real estate and property and so forth, and he became interested in the League. Theodore Kheel was the next president. Kheel was a young lawyer at that time. Now he is one of the nationally known labor mediators. The next president was Henry Steeger, who was a -magazine publisher. The ninth president was Lindsley Kimball, who was with The Rockefeller Foundation. The Rockefellers had an interest in the Urban League over many years, the Rockefeller family. The tenth president was James Linen. During the period he was president, he was also president of Time magazine. And the person who is presently the president, he's the eleventh president, is Donald H. McGannon. He is chairman of the board of Westinghouse Broadcasting, and he's also a very devout Catholic.
Now from 1910 until the present time, there have been eleven Urban League presidents and I have been employed during the presidency of all but the first two.' When I came into the League, L. Hollingsworth Wood was the president. So I have known them all. And the leadership of the Urban League, as I said, the interracial boards composed of men and women, black and white, of various backgrounds, religions.. .-nome have been educators. Mrs. Bethune was a member of the board some years ago. Roger Baldwin, who was the great civil rights advocate and one of the founders of the American Civil Liberties Union, was on our board. We've had many distinguished people who﻿45
AT: (cont.) have believed in the Urban League cause and have given leadership to the board.
The employed executives, as I said, the first one was George Edmund Haynes, and I served beginning with the second executive, who was Eugene Kinckle Jones; the third executive, Lester B. Granger; and the fourth executive, Whitney M. Young, Jr.; and the present executive, Vernon E. Jordan, Jr. This year in January they changed the name from executive director to president. The executive head had always been called the executive director. This year it was changed to president, and the board person was changed to chairman.
CG: Chairman of the board.
AT: Chairman of the board. But I have served, and I think in my previous discussion with you that I told you I'd served with all the executives except the first. And when I came into the League, there were fourteen paid staff people, and now we have around three hundred fifty in the National Urban League.
All during this period the goal of the Urban League has been the same, and it has been, as I said, interracial. In the early days our major interest was serving Negroes, colored people, whatever you call them—now we say black—but beginning in the early sixties, we broadened to include the constituents .. .other minorities and the poor. Now the League over these years has sought to promote equal opportunity, and the programs that we have conducted have been, first, researched. Everything that is done, we develop programs, there is basic research that goes first. And our first research director was Charles S. Johnson. The second research director was Ira de A. Reid. He had been an Urban League fellow, and I'll tell you about the fellows a little later. And the third was Warren Banner, he was also an Urban League fellow; and the present head of our research department is Robert Hill.
We've had a lot of different addresses. We started out in Harlem; the National Urban League was in Harlem at 2303 Seventh Avenue, near the corner of 135th Street. Then when the New York Urban League was organized, the National moved downtown, and we've been downtown ever since. We were on 23rd Street; we were on Madison Avenue. When I came they had just moved to 1133 Broadway, and this was rented space. In 1956, Winthrop Rockefeller gave us a grant of money to buy a building, and the League bought a building on 48th Street between Madison and Fifth, and that became our own headquarters building, 14 East 48th Street. It grew too small and in '66 we sold that building and bought another on 52nd Street; that was 55 East 52nd, right around the corner from Madison. However, we bought that building jointly with the United Negro College Fund and the Urban League owned two-thirds and the College Fund, which was a smaller group, owned one-third. We stayed there until 1975. In 1975 the Urban League and the College Fund, both having grown larger, bought the present building, 500 East 62nd Street; and we jointly own and occupy this building, which is way over on the East Side, on York Avenue and 62nd, near the East River. During this period also, beginning in the mid-sixties, we expanded so that we opened a Washington operation of the National Urban League, and we have there the Washington bureau and the research department.﻿46
AT: (cont.) Over the years... The first regional office was set up in 1917 in Atlanta, Georgia, and Jesse 0. Thomas headed that regional office for many years. This is just a brief outline, explaining how the League has expanded. Then in the sixties we found we needed more regional offices, so that the operations of the local affiliates from the regions could be supervised by a national staff that wouldn't have to travel from New York City to the West Coast or wherever every time they needed to do something, and to organize them and make new leagues. So now we have more regional offices—we have four. The southern regional office is still in Atlanta. There's a central regional office in Chicago. There's an eastern regional office outside of this building, here in New York City. And there's a western regional office in Los Angeles, California.
While Charles S. Johnson was research director, he and Mr. Jones felt that there needed to be some publication so that black writers who were not being published in journals and magazines could have an outlet for their writing, and that some of the research work we were doing could be published in a magazine or some sort of publication. Since equal opportunity was really our slogan, Opportunity magazine came into being and was called Opportunity: Journal of Negro Life. It was a monthly publication and Dr. Johnson was the editor of it, and that was started in 1923. Opportunity magazine remained a very viable publication until 1948. By 1948, black writers and authors were being published and were writing books and so forth. But some of the great artists and writers like Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, first published in Opportunity magazine. Some of the playwrights, some of the artists---E. Sims Campbell's first publication of any
drawings in New York City were published in Opportunity magazine. So the Urban League made a contribution to Negro life through Opportunity magazine. And through its research department, as I said, everything we did was developed and researched.
But the basic program of the Urban League has not changed over the years, although we have different names for things. We are still, as in the beginning, concerned with employment, with health, with housing, with education, and with general community relations. And although there were no departments as such, this was the area of our program operation. And today we may have departments and operations with names, like we have Job Development and Employment, we have Housing, we have Health and Social Welfare, Education; since World War II we had Military and Veterans' Affairs; we now have a program called the Minority Aged. We have a program in the field of the Administration of Justice. But back in the twenties we were still concerned with blacks who were incarcerated in prison and what was happening to them, but we did not call it administration of justice. We were concerned with police brutality, but it had no special department or name. It was part of the Urban League's continuing search to find an equal opportunity for blacks. And we have now what we call Advocacy, but advocacy was what the Urban League was all about since 1910. The advocacy role of the League is to speak out on behalf of issues that concern blacks, whatever they may be. So the program has not changed. One program that we felt... Well, Mr. Jones used to say, "The Urban League will eventually work itself out of a job." But this has not yet occurred in 68 years. But there are some programs that we instituted﻿47
AT: (cont.) that we no longer carry. Now at one time the Urban League was
concerned with finding recreation outlets for children. We no longer have that program because, for the segregated programs that were in operation, we were able to get blacks involved in them and we dropped that recreation program, the National Recreation Association and the Children's Aid Society. A lot of the other programs... At one time we had a placement service for domestic workers, because that in 1910 was one of our major programs, and for other nonskilled jobs. But when the public employment service came along, that job was turned over to the public employment service. I don't know whether I did mention what we did in connection with getting civil service jobs for people...mentioned how we conducted training—yes, I did—training for civil service exams.
CG: Right.
AT: And many of those trainees went into the state employment services around the nation.
CG: 'Cause you took one of the tests yourself.
AT: Yes, I did mention that. So that was a job—the placement service of domestic and personal service and unskilled jobs—that one worked itself out. Now what we do in terms of job development and employment is for the more highly skilled jobs, the technical jobs, those jobs requiring training beyond high school.
One of the other things that we conducted for a long period of time, from the very beginning, was a fellowship program. Because in 1910 there were so few people trained in social work, and the Urban League was primarily a social work organization, so we established what was called the National Urban League Fellowship Program; and this was conducted for many years, up into the late fifties and early sixties. We had a board committee that got together and reviewed applications, interviewed, and then selected men and women to go to graduate training in social work, subsidized by the Urban League. We paid their tuition. In many instances the schools granted the tuition and set up an Urban League fellowship tuition and we paid their living expenses. And over the years we had many distinguished fellows, some of whom immediately came into the Urban League as employees. Forrester B. Washington was an early Urban League fellow and he became executive, the first executive of the Urban League in Detroit,' and later he went to Atlanta and became head of the Atlanta University School of Social Work. As I said, Ira deA.Reid was an Urban League fellow, so was Warren Banner, both of our research directors. Joe Allen, Alexander J. Allen, who is now vice-president here in this office, was an Urban League fellow. He studied at the University of Pittsburgh. Alonzo G. Moron, who became president of
Hampton__he was the first black president of Hampton—was an Urban League
fellow. Inabel Lindsay—and incidentally, do you remember hearing of Inabel Lindsay?
CG: I don't know. I've forgotten.
AT: Inabel Burns Lindsay was dean of the Howard University School of Social Work for many years, and she's a former Urban League fellow. She is in Washington now, and she would be a good...I'm sure she's among your names, for the oral history.﻿48
CG: I'll check it.
AT: I just, I've forgotten some of the people who were Urban League fellows, but we have a long distinguished list of...Pauline, what was her name? Redmond, yes. She's now out at the University of...well, she may have retired now. She was at the University of Wisconsin. Pauline Redmond Coggs, she's associate professor in social services at the University of Wisconsin. She is a former Urban League fellow, and became an executive of one of our leagues before she married and went to Wisconsin. A number of the executives who have now retired have been Urban League fellows. My sister was an Urban League fellow...
CG: And she's now...
AT: And she's now the chairperson of the Massachusetts Parole Board. But she had a pretty extended long career in social work, and worked in the Urban League. So that the Urban League fellowship program at least has made an outstanding contribution to what blacks have done.
Well, the executive operating head of the National Urban League for many years was called the executive director and he— it has always been a man— and has always been a black man, is in charge of the day-to-day operation of the Urban League in terms of hiring and firing staff and developing programs...
CG: Did that just happen, or was that conscious, this always being a man?
AT: The executive's been...it's always been a man. Just like the president has always been white, we've never had a black president. I mean, well now, I'm saying president before...when they made this change from executive director to president, the president now is the chief operating person, and the chairman of the board is the person who heads up the board of volunteer people, men and women, who are responsible for the affairs and property of the Urban League. And they hire the president. They are unpaid volunteers, whereas the president—he is the paid executive head.
CG: I was just wondering if it was always conscious that it was male, or did that just happen?
AT: I guess it was always conscious that it was a man to head up the agency.
And most of the organizations, unless they're really women's organizations, among blacks, are headed by males. Most of the professional organizations, the medical, the dental, all of these.
CG: That's true.
AT: But whether in the foreseeable future there will be a woman executive head of the Urban League, or whether there will be a black chairman, I don't know. Now the very interesting thing, insofar as the local Urban Leagues are concerned, the local Urban Leagues were always headed by a white person and the paid executives would be black. There was so much turmoil created during the sixties when the change came from being colored or Negro to being black, and for...I hate to use the word grass roots, but﻿49
AT: (cont.) this is the word that was used during that time. When grass roots people wanted to be identified more, and when—and the controversy is going on now between middle-class blacks and those who are middle class and who aren't middle class—there was a trend then to begin to make blacks the president of the local Urban Leagues. With one or two exceptions, the locals still use the phrase executive director for the paid person, and president for the head of the volunteer board. Since the sixties there has been an increasing number of blacks as presidents and many of them are women.
Now in two cities—there may be more than two—well, Boston is a good example...where they, too, changed from just a president to having two people on the volunteer board: a chairman of the board, who is white, and a president, who is black. And in Boston there happens to be the chairman of the board, who is white, is a male, and the president of the League, a black female. But it still has the interracial character and this is true. Now the reason, from the very beginning, I believe that the head of the "volunteer board has been white has been because in many communities, and it's true both South and North, that in order to form an Urban League, you had to buck great community pressure. In some of these communities where there was an important businessman, he was a leader in his community, he had community clout? if he agreed to become a leader in the Urban League, he could overcome a lot of opposition in the community. And this is the reason why not only nationally, but locally we have had white businessmen as Urban League chief of the volunteer group that led the Urban League. Now we have never had a white paid executive in either the National or the local Urban Leagues. And here again this has been because in the beginning there were so few jobs of this kind for blacks, we trained them, we paid for their training and then we wanted them to head up the organization, so I think that's the reason.
CG: Do you know anything about some of the projects that have been started in the area of other minorities? What kinds of problems those are...
AT:
Well when we said we work with blacks and urban minorities, we're an advocate for them, and they're all under this one umbrella. There's no special project for Puerto Ricans...
CG: So it's essentially an urban...
AT-	..or Indians or what. We are all together under this...We formed coalitions
in"the sixties, we formed coalitions. Now you will find on the West Coast among the board members, you will find Chicanos, you will find native Americans--there are two in Denver, in Kansas City, San Francisco, Los Angeles Portland, Oregon, down the West Coast. At one time the New York Urban League...and it's true of staff too, we've had interracial staffs all along except the director, but the deputies, the child development people, the education people, we've had interracial staffs, and we have on our staff here--we have not only native Americans, we have West Indian Americans, those of West Indian parentage, we have Jews, Gentiles, Orientals, Puerto Ricans. on the national staff and on local staffs, all around. In New York City there was a period in the sixties when the Puerto Rican population did not want to identify with the black population, but some of the things we were pushing for and things that the League obtained turned^ out for the benefit of Puerto Ricans and poor whites and blacks. So that's why I say now we use the term blacks, the poor and other minorities.﻿50
CG: I have another question I want to ask you. What is the greatest crisis that the Urban League has ever faced that you can remember?
AT: That's a tough question. I don't think I could say that I remember any greatest crisis.
CG: What crises do you remember? Any?
AT: I wouldn't call them crisis periods, I would call them some of the high points, high points, and not in the National Urban League alone, it has been the local and National Urban League involved now. For instance, I would say the Chicago race riots of 1919 was a high point in the whole Urban League history. We had a branch in Chicago and the executive there had some responsibilities to the national, because we at that time had no regional office in Chicago. And when the Chicago race riots came along, the Chicago Urban League was called in by the city of Chicago, and T. Arnold Hill, who was executive at that time, was placed on the mayor's committee. And that mayor's committee expanded to become the, I think they called it the Chicago Interracial Commission, that did the well-known study headed by Dr. Clark of the University of Chicago, called the Chicago Race Relations Study, or something like that.	And the Urban League was involved
in that, and the Urban League became a center, a clearinghouse for information, and for rehousing blacks. The Urban League was in the whole center of the Chicago race riots in 1919.
The same was true when they had the Detroit riots in '43, and the Detroit Urban League, here again, and John Dancy was the executive. And that was well documented, and the Detroit Urban League was called by the city to help ameliorate the conditions. The same was true in New York City when they had the race riot, the first one in New York City in recent years. Mayor LaGuardia was mayor at that time. There were two in New York, but the first one, not only the Urban League but the NAACP was called in. But the NAACP, being a volunteer group without paid staff and an office as such, was not able to do some of the things that the Urban League could do, as a center, clearinghouse. There were so many rumors going around, the Urban League again had to staunch some of the rumors and build up rapport and confidence. So if they are crisis situations, they were not crisis situations for the Urban League per se. They were crisis situations for the black population, and the Urban League moved in to give assistance and aid and whatever it could.	I have not touched at all
upon some of the things that I didn't think was necessary to talk about because they're well documented in the Urban League official history, Blacks in the City, and they're well documented in other studies of black life. There was the study that the Urban League in Chicago did. But this was not a crisis situation, but the first...when blacks were not being hired in the war industry, and the NAACP and the Urban League and other organizations got together.	Philip Randolph and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car
Porters was the main mover there.	Walter White and Lester Granger
were involved in it. When they had their first plan for a March on Washington and President Eisenhower...Wait a minute, who was president? It wasn't Eisenhower.﻿51
CG: Roosevelt. This Is World War II, right? It was Roosevelt, right.
AT: Philip Randolph, and Lester Granger and Walter White and they planned the March on Washington—it was in 1941—and they went down to Washington to meet with President Roosevelt and the stress was so great, that that's when Executive Order 8802 was signed. So the Urban League was involved in that crisis situation. And then in 1960s...the second March on Washington became a reality.
CG: '63.
AT: '63. And that, of course, involved all of the civil rights groups. And in August, 1963, the March on Washington took place. It was a reality that time. I remember very well all the planning that went into this first march on Washington. We were ready to move as the executive order came. And the Urban League was very much involved in the second march on Washington. Whitney Young was the executive then. And so that was a crisis situation. In the early sixties, when the civil rights groups got together, with Martin Luther King, Whitney Young, Roy Wilkins, James Farmer, Floyd McKissick, A. Philip Randolph, John Lewis and CORE...
CG: Wasn't Floyd McKissick with CORE?
AT: Floyd McKissick was in CORE. They formed that civil rights group that organized the march on Washington and stayed together for so long. Afterwards the group was called the United Council on Civil Rights Leadership. And many people claim that Whitney Young was really the one who kept that group together. It's only been last fall, I think, Vernon Jordan got the coalition together again out at Chicago. The National Council of Negro Women was part of that, but... So that the crisis situations that the Urban League faced as a league have been crisis situations in terms of having enough money to operate. Now I can recall the crisis situation in the thirties, during the depression days, of '32, '33, '34, '35—we didn't even have enough money, and that was when New York City was really in dire straits. They had the bread lines, food lines and all, where the New York Urban League had a soup kitchen and lines stringing out into the street.	Mrs. August Belmont, who was a very wealthy woman in New
York City, set up the first unit that now became really the welfare department of the City of New York, because the City of New York was doing very little in terms of welfare.
CG: Mrs. August Belmont?
AT: Yes. And in order to qualify for welfare, you had to be in real need. Then they set up a program where the people who went on welfare were given paid work in terms of what they did. But they were signing some of these people for social welfare organizations. In other words, if you got on welfare, in order to earn the money, you would be assigned to work in a social welfare agency in New York, and then each week the welfare department would come in and pay you your check. The Urban League had to get rid of, really fire some people because we didn't have enough money. So some of these people applied for welfare and were assigned to work in the Urban League. So we were able to maintain some of our staff people. However, there were some staff people who were not eligible for welfare and they still could not be paid.﻿52
AT: The Urban League couldn't pay them, so many executives used their savings (cont.)and went from week to week without any paycheck. Then when we would get a contribution, then we'd get our back pay.	I remember very well the
Christmas of the one year, and it was in the thirties, when there was no paycheck. We hadn't gotten paid for November, December, and Mr. Jones owned his home in Flushing{	He and Mrs. Jones went to the bank and co-
signed a note, mortgaged their home in order to meet the payroll so we would have one check for Christmas for that year. Now that was what I called a crisis situation for the League, and during the early part of Mr. Granger's administration, we had some crises where we went long periods without pay. I remember the Chicago Urban League was paying their employees in scrip. Some of the scrip was never redeemed. But they were using scrip throughout Chicago during the depression, but New York never got to that point. But I remember days when we wouldn't get paid. We were at 1133 Broadway and there was a drugstore on the ground floor; they had a lunch counter, and they served lunches and so forth—run by a very nice Jewish couple——and they would let us run up tabs on meals. I would come down, eat my breakfast; I'd eat my lunch and my dinner there. And I remember one time when finally we got paid... Of course, the food didn't cost as much then. So finally I remember one day when I got paid, I think I took almost half of my paycheck and paid them back for the meals that I had eaten there. So the lack of money was a crisis situation.
I mentioned that Winthrop Rockefeller had given us money to buy a building. Now he came on the board right after the war. The Rockefeller family had always had an interest in the League, because much League money comes from foundations and funds and wealthy philanthropy, and he personally gave an awful lot of money to the Urban League, as well as the Rockefeller family. The Rosenwald family, the Rosenwalds supported the Urban League in Chicago and Nashville. And then when we got to the turning point, right after World War II, when many more...and that was at the time when we began to get... I sort of drew a line between the Urban League presidents who came from families with a tradition of interracial activity. Mr. Robert W. Dowling was a white businessman, and Theodore Kheel was a labor mediator and a lawyer. Their leadership of the Urban League, leading fund-raising campaigns and appealing to businessmen in the community they knew, began to bring to us a lot of financial support that was not from foundations. That was the beginning of the interest of commercial and industrial operations. And you know from your own life how that... now the main corporations that produce household products that you use, now support the Urban League and they support other interracial activities. So that anything you name, Proctor and Gamble, Westinghouse, Western Electric, Bell Telephone, Westinghouse—all of these large corporations—Philip Morris, cigarette companies, all of them now support the Urban League, and our financial support has increased. And through government projects, the federal government itself from the various departments—Labor or HEW—support programs and projects of nonprofit agencies. A lot of our money now comes from government. So that the money crisis that we faced many times does not exist now.﻿53
CG: That's good. Do you remember, was the Urban League involved in the abolishment of the, I think they used to call them slave markets in New York City where the women used to go and stand and wait...
AT: The New York Urban League. We had a person on our staff, Leroy Jeffries, who did an article on the slave markets in connection with some of his studies at Columbia University. It was published in Opportunity magazine, I've forgotten which year. But the New York Urban League was involved in that, yes. And for the record, the slave markets were places, and they were very prominent in the Bronx, where women who wanted domestic jobs would go out and stand in the morning and women would come and hire them on the spot, and, of course, underpay them. This was, we were active in the whole movement to organize household workers. That was after the slave markets, when the movement became...there was a national committee on household employment, I think, led by Eleanor Coit, and the Urban League was involved in that.
CG: I looked over my notes, and I...things I asked you before, but maybe I
took bad notes. What are some of the most important problems that you feel black women face?
AT: I don't know that I can answer that. Because women face some problems, and black women will face s ome of the same problems that women face in terms of upward mobility on jobs and recognition on jobs. Blacks have pioneered before women, so that some of the things that blacks have done to open up opportunities, women, both black and white, have moved into. I think many women's groups will acknowledge that. I think it is acknowledged by some of the native American groups, that the forward movement of blacks for identity and for recognition in the sixties was the forerunner of the American Indian movement that has now swollen to such proportions that the native American groups are asking for their land back. But I think black women have moved into jobs, they've moved into...some black women have even gone ahead of black men in terms of opportunity. But I can't articulate on things that I feel are problems for black women.
CG: Do you have any special perspectives on being single in American society?
AT: Not really. I think things happen as they're supposed to happen and I
often don't question why they happen. But from the very beginning when I began to work in the Urban League and found the Urban League so absorbing and such an outlet for the things that I felt I wanted to do, and the years went by so fast, that I didn't ever want to stop working for the Urban League. I guess that's got to stop now, but I never seemed to want to stop working for the Urban League. Then I felt, I come from a family of two boys and two girls, and the two girls are the only ones in the family who have had college training. My older brother was not interested, my younger brother was not interested in going further in school. They both became automobile mechanics. And I felt that my sister ought to go to college just as I did.

She was assistant to executives Granger, Young, and Jordan, the right hand of these executives, and yet she was married and has a child and has grandchildren. But she was able to... But her work was at the desk almost daily. She would go home in the evenings, and periods when she traveled were of short duration.
