REDMAN: So Louise my last question was again about how the men and the women
interacted at the plant. Do you have any other thoughts on that as far as, were
some of them more like mentors to these young women engineers?

MCCLAIN: Yes, yes.

REDMAN: Now how about, it’s interesting to me because prior to the war it
would have been fairly uncommon for a woman to become a professional engineer.
Is that correct?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Even after the war many women left their jobs and the sort of popular
notion was that many women were leaving their jobs as Rosie the Riveter and then
going back to the home or buying a house in the suburbs. Was it ever your
intention to stay with engineering, or did you think that most of the women who
were in your program wanted to stay in math and science careers, or did they,
did you get the impression that a lot of people were doing this as part of the
war effort and they knew it was a temporary sort of position?

MCCLAIN: Yes, they knew it was sort of temporary, and I think, I know I did,
after the war I went back to Denver University. I still majored in math.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: But didn’t do the engineering.

REDMAN: Okay, so tell me then about, we’ll get back in a minute to your work
in the plant because I do want to talk more about that, but in your actual work
as an engineer and then going back to Denver University and studying math rather
than engineering, did you just get kind of a taste for engineering and decide
that’s not exactly what you wanted to do or wanted to study, or how did that
sort of work?

MCCLAIN: I really, it was a matter of wanting to get through college.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: And I --

REDMAN: And math came easy to you.

MCCLAIN: And math came easy, and I don’t think I ever wanted to be an engineer really.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so for you then as well did you think of your work as an
engineer at Curtiss-Wright as a temporary wartime position?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so did the plant ever have any war bond drives?

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes, yes.

REDMAN: Do you recall, can you tell me a little bit about what that was like?

MCCLAIN: They did very well, I don’t remember any figures or anything for, but
yeah, but we had lots of them as I recall.

REDMAN: Okay, so how about yourself? Did you buy war bonds at that time?

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes.

REDMAN: And did that come out of your salary, or did you purchase them just kind
of as you went along.

MCCLAIN: Purchased as we went along, well, there was always as I recall a place
or person to see if you wanted to get one any time at all it was.

REDMAN: Okay, now how did you, so tell me then about if you’re working mainly
at the drafting table, you said that periodically engineers could go down and
take a look at what was going on in the assembly line, is that correct?

MCCLAIN: I think mainly on their lunch hour I think.

REDMAN: Okay, and how about you, did you ever go down to the assembly line and
watch these planes being put together.

MCCLAIN: Yes, I did a couple of times.

REDMAN: Okay, what are your recollections about that?

MCCLAIN: It was the first time I saw a Rosie the Riveter.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: It was terribly noisy.

REDMAN: Oh, really, okay.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, between the rivet guns and all the other equipment, it was noisy.

REDMAN: Yeah, what were your impressions of these young women, women of all ages
I guess that were working on these assembly lines, the Rosie and Riveters?

MCCLAIN: Most of them worked quite hard obviously, and some of them seemed a
little rough or tough, but I didn’t really know any of them so --

REDMAN: Okay, okay, now I know at the, I’ve done one interview with a woman
who worked in a P37 plant in Burbank, and she mentioned that workers were
divided into crews working on the body of the plane, and then they had two
additional crews working on the wings. So they’d have a riveter on one side, a
riveter on the other side, and then maybe a riveter who was working on the body
of the plane along with a welder, maybe divided up as they assembled the plane
on the way through. Do you recall how the line was set up at all at the plant?

MCCLAIN: I do remember that there were I would guess, and it isn’t a large
plane, the Helldiver. I would guess there would be a half dozen workers on it,
three on one side and three on the other.

REDMAN: Okay, and do you recall, so definitely there were riveters with rivet
guns, and then were there also welders?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so these crews made up of riveters and welders would work on
a different side of the plane maybe for a number of hours at a time, okay.

MCCLAIN: I think so, and on a wing, for instance.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so when you walked through the plant in particular, did you
pay any special attention to how the landing gear and hydraulics were actually assembled?

MCCLAIN: I never saw the landing gear actually go on.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: So no, I did see the bomb bay and see them testing it to up and down.

REDMAN: Right, yeah, to make sure it actually opens.

MCCLAIN: Yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so you mentioned it being quite loud, and it must have been
a quite different environment in the engineering room.

MCCLAIN: Yes, it was not quiet, but compared to the line it was very quiet.

REDMAN: Okay, so there was maybe a lot more vocal noise, a lot of people talking
at any one time?

MCCLAIN: Oh, yeah.

REDMAN: Okay. How many people did the engineering room hold at any given time,
do you know how, can you describe how large it was?

MCCLAIN: It was very large. I would guess at any given time there were at least
a hundred people.

REDMAN: A hundred people, wow, okay, so quite a number of people working on
these two planes in particular for Curtiss-Wright.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, go ahead.

MCCLAIN: Well, that also didn’t include the engine. The engine was the plane
moved elsewhere to Pratt Whitney, I believe, to get an engine on it.

REDMAN: Do you know where abouts that was?

MCCLAIN: No.

REDMAN: Where Pratt Whitney was? Okay, so it would go somewhere else to have an
engine placed in it.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Wow, that’s incredible, okay, okay, so did you get the impression that
throughout the entire duration of the war, so you arrived then in late ’43 or
early ’44 is that correct?

MCCLAIN: That’s correct.

REDMAN: And then worked there through the end of the war.

MCCLAIN: Yes, and a couple of months beyond even.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so one of the things I’d like to ask is that, I’ve seen
in some places or heard that towards the end of the war when it became maybe a
little clear that the United States was on the side that was going to ultimately
win the war, some people started to leave their jobs at factories and production
may have slowed down a little bit. Did you get that feeling, or did you get the
feeling that this was a humming plant that was just constantly turning out these planes?

MCCLAIN: I got the feeling that they were pretty humming. Of course, they were
strictly in the Pacific by then, and so the planes were going to the Pacific,
and when the little scout plane was finished, it would have had an order right
away. It was just being tested towards the last of the war.

REDMAN: Okay, so were they using a lot of the, I assume building a new plane is
kind of a completely different system compared to this assembly line for this
tried and true hell cat diver that you’ve built for a number of years, so this
new plane would have involved new designs and new engineering protocol and new assembly.

MCCLAIN: Probably, yeah

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so but you were only working on the diver?

MCCLAIN: No, I worked on the experimental plane, too. I don’t remember what I
was doing.

REDMAN: Can’t recall that, okay, but you did work a little bit on the --

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: But the majority of your time would have been on the diver, is that right?

MCCLAIN: On the Helldiver, yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so do you remember, this is maybe a question you might not
be able to recall, but do you remember what type of music you would listen to
during the war, or what would the girls do when you got home? Were they all
working on the same shift?

MCCLAIN: Yes, we were all working the same shift. We took walks and swimming a
lot, and listened to the popular music of the time.

REDMAN: Okay, do you recall, there are a couple of songs I wanted to ask you
about, do you remember the original Rosie the Riveter song by any chance?

MCCLAIN: No, I don’t.

REDMAN: There was also a song at the time, it was called, “Don’t be an
absentee,” that was encouraging people to go to work.

MCCLAIN: People to go to work, I don’t remember.

REDMAN: Okay, all right, but there was a campaign a “Don’t be an absentee”
campaign with posters and things of that time.

MCCLAIN: Uh huh.

REDMAN: Yeah, so tell me a little bit more about, were there three shifts at the plant?

MCCLAIN: No, there was only the one shift. It closed down at night. We worked
five and a half days a week.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: Forty-four hours, and then a lot of overtime. I had several, many weeks
of forty-eight hours, sixty hours.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: A women was not allowed to go beyond sixty.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, would that mostly take place in terms of working into the
evening, or showing up early, or a little bit of both, or working on weekends?
How did that overtime -- ?

MCCLAIN: It was working evenings.

REDMAN: Working evenings, okay, so you’d maybe be working on a particular
problem or something that you wanted to finish?

MCCLAIN: That they wanted to finish.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so there would be pressure to stay.

MCCLAIN: Yes, yes.

REDMAN: But there was a rule that you could only accumulate sixty hours of --

MCCLAIN: Yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, and what did you think about that at the time?

MCCLAIN: Well, that’s another kind of funny story. I rather enjoyed it. I
guess I felt I worked more I think than my, I only had two roommates by that
time, one girl had gone back home, and I guess I felt kind of superior, I’m
going to have to work late.

REDMAN: Okay, so there was a pride involved in taking on a little bit of extra --

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: So how were your roommates? Can you tell me a little bit about, we
talked a little bit about what you guys would do together, were they your
primary social connection in Columbus, or did you make other friends gradually,
or how did that work?

MCCLAIN: A few neighbors we were very friendly with, I don’t think we ever did
much with them, though. It was mostly the roommates, and other cadets that lived
around town.

REDMAN: So there would be other cadets that you’d gone through this program with.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: But then were at the plant that you continued to spend time with.

MCCLAIN: Yes, and a couple of girls that had been at other schools still in the
cadets program that, oh, I was very good friends with one.

REDMAN: So you’d mentioned that they’d gone to places like Penn State and
Iowa State and Ohio State, as well as Minnesota.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: So then these women would come to Columbus as well.

MCCLAIN: Some of them.

REDMAN: Some of them, okay, do you know the other locations that they were being
sent to?

MCCLAIN: You know I don’t.

REDMAN: Okay, okay.

MCCLAIN: I should, but I don’t.

REDMAN: Well, let’s talk about Columbus. Can you tell me a little bit about
what Columbus was like during the war? Did it change at all? Were there, because
I know a lot of different places had a lot of new people coming in for work, and
so there were new apartment buildings going up, there were new businesses
opening in order to accommodate these folks. Was that the case in Columbus? Was
Columbus a bustling town at the time or -- ?

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes, yes. Well, our apartment was brand new, and the outskirts of
town were bustling.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so a lot of people who might have been working at
Curtiss-Wright, is that correct, or were there other major plants or factories
in town?

MCCLAIN: Oh, that I don’t recall. I don’t think so. Of course, it’s the
Ohio capitol.

REDMAN: And it’s where Ohio State is as well.

MCCLAIN: Yes, oh, yes. In fact, that’s probably the reason we didn’t work
Saturday afternoons.

REDMAN: Oh is that right? Okay, yeah, yeah, and would you, watching football at
the campus of Ohio State is kind of a religious pastime.

MCCLAIN: Yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, so would the town just kind of shut down and -- ?

MCCLAIN: Almost.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then did your job stay more or less the same at the
factory, or did it change over time?

MCCLAIN: I think I was given a little more responsibility over time.

REDMAN: Can you tell me about that, about how that took place, do you recall how
your job may have changed, how you might have gotten more responsibility?

MCCLAIN: Well, I think working with the engineer on drawing the final plans of
the landing gear and hydraulics landing gear, and bomb bay hydraulic system was
a big step forward.

REDMAN: Okay, that’s a large responsibility.

MCCLAIN: Yes, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, so that was that project alone, do you recall how time consuming
that was, how much of your time that took?

MCCLAIN: No, I don’t.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: We finished it, I remember, I debated about whether I should tell you
this, but I think it’s funny and you can use it or not. The man I worked with
-- really all the hydraulic parts or many of them are either internal or
external, and those were the words he used, even though their numbers would be
like 361F or 361W, or M, and he would never use the M or the F, and I thought
someday he’s going to miss and I’m going to laugh, and he’s going to be so hurt.

REDMAN: Right, yeah.

MCCLAIN: But I never did.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so yeah, you were always ready for that.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, yeah.

REDMAN: So tell me at the end of the war do you recall VE Day or VJ Day?

MCCLAIN: I recall VJ Day, I don’t recall VE Day. VJ Day my roommates and I
went downtown and yelled and shouted with the crowd.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and can you describe what that atmosphere felt like, after
years of being at war?

MCCLAIN: Oh, it was a release, I think, for all the people there. You just,
everybody was friendly, it wasn’t like now I think I would be afraid to go to
downtown New York. It gets pretty wild, but it wasn’t wild. There was some
drinking, but not excessive, and the police on duty, too.

REDMAN: Yeah, yeah, so people were having a good time and letting a little
loose, but it wasn’t too crazy.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, right.

REDMAN: Okay, so then your girlfriends went downtown with you as well, is that correct?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Did most people at the end of the war, most people were just happy for
the war to be done, but at the same time a lot of people had gotten their first
job at defense industry or they’d maybe been pulled out of the Depression by
getting these jobs in defense, so did you get the feeling, was anybody saddened
by the idea that they knew that these war time jobs were coming to an end?

MCCLAIN: I don’t remember that. I remember people who had lost loved ones that
were saddened, but the war ended, and their feeling was sort of so what, it
didn’t end soon enough.

REDMAN: Right, okay, okay, so some people regretted the fact that they had lost
loved ones, okay. How did you feel about the dropping of the atomic bombs in 1945?

MCCLAIN: In 1945 I think I felt it ended the war and was necessary. I’m not
sure now how I really feel.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so your feelings have maybe changed a little over time?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, do you think that most people at the time would have agreed
with you that they were just happy that the war was over --

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Even if it required dropping --

MCCLAIN: The atomic bombs, yeah.

REDMAN: Do you remember learning about the death of FDR? I’m trying to think,
he had been President for much of your adult life.

MCCLAIN: Yes. I don’t remember, I know he died and all, but I don’t remember
how or when I found out.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and did you have any feelings about Harry Truman then as President?

MCCLAIN: I think I doubted his ability, but I changed my mind and thought he was
quite good.

REDMAN: Okay, so early on you maybe didn’t think he could live up to the
standard that FDR had set.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then tell me about what happened at the end of the war.
Were a lot of people let go from the plant where you worked?

MCCLAIN: No, they weren’t. I think they still hoped to get a contract,
probably on the little scout ship, or possibly still on the Helldiver. They were
wonderful about not letting, we had very little work. I can remember going up to
my lead man and asking for something to do, and he gave me a small job which
should have been finished in a day, and I took it to him three days later.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: He said, “You’ve got a nerve. I give you a job, and you get it done.”

REDMAN: Okay, so work really slowed down.

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes, terribly.

REDMAN: Yeah, yeah, so was it clear then that eventually people would be let go,
or did you sort of hold out hope that these contracts would come through?

MCCLAIN: I didn’t want to continue working, but I think quite a few people did.

REDMAN: Okay, now how long did you stay at the plant before returning to the
University of Denver?

MCCLAIN: Well, up until about two weeks before Christmas, and I think by then I
had already signed up, Denver you always, their quarter system worked so you’d
have Christmas vacation between quarters, and there wasn’t the mob trying to
go to school then that there, well, there was quite a few, but you could get
classes even late, and so I decided I’d go back and start school again.

REDMAN: What were your feelings about that? Were you looking forward to starting
school? Were you sad to leave the plant? Were you sad to leave your friends in
Columbus? All of the above.

MCCLAIN: All of the above, yeah. But well, it wasn’t the same any more in
Columbus or at the plant, and so I just felt the time had come to get back to school.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then tell me about what it was like to return to the
University of Denver, so this would have been in early ’46, so in the spring
semester of ’46. So what I’m curious about is that a lot of people would
have come back to school at around the same time or maybe the following semester
using the GI Bill, so there must have been an influx of men back to campus, is
that correct?

MCCLAIN: That’s correct.

REDMAN: How did that change the dynamic, and then also I’d like to ask if your
being a little older and having a few years of experience working as an engineer
change your experience on campus at all?

MCCLAIN: Well, I had been a sorority girl before I left, but when I went back, I
was older than most of the girls and just didn’t feel it was for me, and asked
to become inactive, and they said there was no such a thing, and then I said,
“Well, I’m going to drop,” and did.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then your social life must have changed a little from
before when you were involved in a sorority to maybe being a little more
independent in ’46.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, and then what was your, did you move back in with your parents at
that time, or -- ?

MCCLAIN: Yes, I did, and it worked.

REDMAN: Okay, so they had continued on with the same careers during the war.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Were they just happy to have you back in Denver?

MCCLAIN: Yes, I think they were. I didn’t tell them I was coming. I just
walked in the door, and I thought they’d be so surprised. My mother said, “I
thought we’d be seeing you.”

REDMAN: Is that right, okay, so you thought you were just going to blow them away.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, no.

REDMAN: They were just, “All right, welcome back.”

MCCLAIN: Yeah, yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, excellent. Now how about your sister? What did she do during the
war? So she was a little older.

MCCLAIN: She was older. She was married. She had by then their son was two or
three I guess, then she had a baby girl, which her husband hardly got to know.
He was so thrilled to come home and really be a father to his baby girl.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and where abouts did she live then?

MCCLAIN: Denver.

REDMAN: Okay, so did you then get to see your niece quite a bit and okay, so how
about your boyfriend that you had been dating while in Denver? What happened
with that story?

MCCLAIN: We broke up. We became engaged and broke up shortly after. I think we
both realized that we were much too different. It wasn’t working. It was a
mutual thing.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and then tell me about continuing on in school and
graduating from college.

MCCLAIN: Well, it was exciting for me. I enjoyed it.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and you majored in math all the way through.

MCCLAIN: Yes, and I also was able to get some credits for the schooling I did in Minnesota.

REDMAN: Oh, is that right, okay.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, it amounted to a quarter about, which helped.

REDMAN: Okay, and then how about, can you tell me about did any of the things
that you learned while working in the engineering room apply at all to going
back to the college classroom and taking these math and science courses?

MCCLAIN: No, it applied best because I could get a job as a draftsman and help
earn my expenses for school.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: I could get, you could almost always get a job at Denver U, but it
didn’t pay very much, so --

REDMAN: Right, okay, so you could work in the library or something like that,
but you were a draftsman.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: So where did you find work as a draftsman in Denver?

MCCLAIN: Well, the first place was Prouty Brothers Engineering Company, they did
a lot of surveying, and I did maps of the surveys.

REDMAN: So how do you spell Prouty, I’m sorry.

MCCLAIN: P R O U T Y.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so Prouty Brothers, and they would do surveying in maps and
you would draft.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, they would make a picture of where a house sat on the lot or
something like that, yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then did you, you worked for another private engineering --

MCCLAIN: Then after that I went to Sterns Roger Manufacturing and Engineering,
and they did a lot of pressure work, and anyway, it was quite a large company.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so you continued on in an engineering career and a drafting
career for some time.

MCCLAIN: Until I graduated, yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and then what did you do after graduation?

MCCLAIN: Well, I did continue until my new boyfriend got out of school, and we
came to California and I was able to get a job as a statistician.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so you were excited to get a job that was more along the
lines of math and numbers.

MCCLAIN: Oh, yeah, yes. I didn’t ever want to sit on a drafting stool again.

REDMAN: Oh, is that right? Okay, yeah.

MCCLAIN: I had a bad experience, this is kind of funny. If you have the time
I’ll tell you.

REDMAN: Oh, of course.

MCCLAIN: When the little scout ship, we knew it was ready to be tested, flight
tested, but the testers really take their time. I learned to admire them. They
would maybe taxi around for days.

REDMAN: Is that right, okay.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, so you never knew when it was going to fly. One day a call came
across the room and spread to the whole engineering department the SC’s
airborne. Everybody rushed to the windows to see it, and I as usual had my feet
twined around my drafting stool.

REDMAN: Oh, no.

MCCLAIN: And I went down with the drafting stool, so one man stopped and said,
“Are you all right?” I said, “I’m fine, don’t miss it, go.” So I got
up in time to see it. It had flown up runway, and actually it was in the air up
runway and it came back about two stories high.

REDMAN: Okay, you know it sounds like being in first grade and seeing the first
snowfall of the season, all of the kids would run to the windows to see it.

MCCLAIN: Run to the windows to see it. If we’d been in a ship, we would have sunk.

REDMAN: Yeah, everybody would have just gone to the wrong side. Well, yeah,
it’s interesting that you had this career in engineering and it seems like
sort out of utility, out of the opportunities that were there, but you may not
have been passionate about it, and indeed, you may wanted to have never seen a
drafting table again after that. But tell me what you did as a statistician then
after --

MCCLAIN: Well, I worked for Douglas Aircraft, and they --

REDMAN: In Southern California?

MCCLAIN: In Los Angeles, yeah, and they, for instance, there are some things the
mass of a plane is a good indicator of how fast you can get it done and how you
can schedule it.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: It was master scheduling, I can’t think of the rest of our title, but
it was interesting, didn’t get enough of it, a lot of it was --

REDMAN: Your hands, one more time, your hands.

MCCLAIN: Oh.

REDMAN: No problem, its fine, its fine. I even hear your better, yeah. Yeah, so
I’m sorry based on the mass of the plane, the statisticians would be able to
figure out how long it would take to construct the entire plane?

MCCLAIN: Um hm.

REDMAN: Was that more or less based on just my very simple understanding of how
this might work, of just the history of developing these planes and how long it
would take to develop a small plane versus a large plane?

MCCLAIN: I think so, yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, so you would maybe compare and contrast the numbers of other
projects, or how -- ?

MCCLAIN: Well, they could figure the mass of the plane if they had to, just add
up the weight of the --

REDMAN: Components, or yeah.

MCCLAIN: Yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so did any of your, when you found this job at Douglas,
well, first of all, can I ask how you found the job at Douglas? Do you recall -- ?

MCCLAIN: I went around everywhere I could think of.

REDMAN: So my question is, did working for Curtiss-Wright help you in securing
the job at Douglas at all? It sounds like pretty unrelated work, but I’m
curious if, it’s both in airplane production.

MCCLAIN: Yeah. I would suspect it did help me a little.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: But it was somebody’s imagination I think.

REDMAN: Okay, yeah. Even though you may have been working at an airplane
production factory, the work was totally different.

MCCLAIN: Totally different, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so but you liked the job at Douglas significantly more in
terms of the actual work, is that correct?

MCCLAIN: Yes, that’s right.

REDMAN: It was more pure numbers, mathematics, the type of work that you were into.

MCCLAIN: Yeah.

REDMAN: Now were there more women in this type of role after the war, or were
you still part of a minority, a very small minority of women working in this
type of career.

MCCLAIN: Well, I was the only statistician in my department that was a woman.

REDMAN: Okay, so how many statisticians would there have been in your
department, roughly, do you recall?

MCCLAIN: Three.

REDMAN: Okay, and the others would be men.

MCCLAIN: Oh, gee, I don’t know what they did.

REDMAN: Okay, if they were statisticians or if they were just hanging around.

MCCLAIN: No, They were working.

REDMAN: They were working, okay, okay. So then would you be in a particular
office with -- ?

MCCLAIN: Yes, yes. Our office had in our little room, there were three of us and
then were a lot of little rooms not like they are now, but just probably twenty
people in the department.

REDMAN: Okay. Can I ask about the process of doing math and engineering before
modern calculators and things of that nature? The job today must be wildly
different from what it would have been like during the war and then immediately
after, is that correct?

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes. Computers have changed it a great deal. And like drafting,
when we almost always when you were drawing or drafting anything you did a front
view and a side view. Well, now they just set the computer, and it goes around.

REDMAN: Okay, so they could do a 360 --

MCCLAIN: Yeah, yeah. And the math, of course, the computers help speed it up so much.

REDMAN: Okay, yeah, well, I can imagine there would have been times when you
wish you could have rotated a --

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes. Yes, I drew one piece of just a bracket of some kind, and I
did a front view and that was okay, it kind of had shape. Then I did the side
view, and it looked like a meat cleaver, it was the weirdest thing I ever saw.
So yeah, that has changed tremendously, and statistics, too, has changed so much.

REDMAN: Being able to use graphing software and all kind of calculations.

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes, yeah. I can’t imagine really.

REDMAN: Okay, okay. So then you eventually got married and were living in
Southern California.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, and then did you start a family there as well?

MCCLAIN: Yes, I did, and you could not work for Douglas Aircraft after your
third month of pregnancy.

REDMAN: Is that right, okay.

MCCLAIN: I took that to court.

REDMAN: Is that right, so basically as soon as you start showing, you need to --

MCCLAIN: Yeah, you’re out of there.

REDMAN: Okay, so you went to court.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, I think the lawyer I got said, “You aren’t going to get
anywhere with this at all.” And I believed him.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so it was a short-lived battle for that, okay. But you
wanted to stay at Douglas.

MCCLAIN: Yes, at least for a while longer, and I don’t’ know whether I’d
have stayed, I doubt if I’d stay after my baby was born, but I would have
liked to have stayed nine months, we needed the money.

REDMAN: Okay, yeah, yeah. So then you raised, you then left work for a little
while or more or less for good.

MCCLAIN: More or less permanently, which is something I have regretted I think,
but yeah.

REDMAN: Tell me a little bit about that, so you in substance you may not have
wanted to stay at Douglas forever, but you would have preferred to stay working.

MCCLAIN: I think so, I did a lot of volunteer jobs, and some of them were really fun.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: But I guess I thought if I had it all to do over again, I would have
liked to have been a teacher in the primary grades.

REDMAN: Is that right, okay, okay. Would you have wanted to teach in particular
math or pass on your love of mathematics?

MCCLAIN: Not particularly. I just loved to work with little children, first,
second grade at most.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: Whether I’d have been a success I have no idea.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, well, what I’d like end on is I’d like to ask if there,
we’ve talked about a lot of things today.

MCCLAIN: Yes, we surely have.

REDMAN: We have talked about growing up in Denver, what your favorite subjects
were in school, how you sort of absorbed all of the subjects in school growing
up, and what your parents were like, what they did for work, this jobs training
program with Curtiss-Wright, being a cadet, and then the actual job and working
and what happened to you after the war. Is there anything you’d like to add to
this, anything that you think we passed over? You can go ahead and take a look
at your notes if you like.

MCCLAIN: Well, I don’t think it’s probably, no, I did cover that. No, I
think we practically covered my whole life.

REDMAN: We’ve done a pretty darn good job, yeah.

MCCLAIN: I will say maybe I would have enjoyed trying to get kids less afraid of
math, because that’s why a lot of them don’t like it, they’re afraid of
it. I think this may have been handed down by an older sibling or by their
parents or something.

REDMAN: How about women in mathematics in particular? That’s one thing that
I’ve wanted to ask about, and I asked you about in a couple of different ways.
It strikes me that even today women are in subtle ways discouraged from careers
in math in particular, but math and science as well, but mathematics in
particular, so it’s pretty unusual this program sort out of necessity where
700 girls go into an engineering program that would have in some sense bucked
social norms at the time. It would have been pretty different for these college
classes to then be filled with young women.

MCCLAIN: Well, yes, but our classes were completely separate from the rest of
the university.

REDMAN: Okay, okay.

MCCLAIN: Because of our ten-month schedule.

REDMAN: Okay, do you think the professors got used to that, that they were then
walking into an engineering classroom that would be entirely women?

MCCLAIN: Yes, I think they did.

REDMAN: Okay, but then there was a little bit more strife then with some of the
male engineers at Curtiss-Wright sometimes. Most of them you said were quite
nice, but sometimes some of them resented having women, and that in ’46 and
beyond at Douglas Aircraft with your pregnancy and then being told you had to
leave this career, it seems that women had some disadvantages in terms of
education and then getting these jobs.

MCCLAIN: Yes, yes.

REDMAN: Could you just reflect on that for a moment?

MCCLAIN: Yes, I think that I’ve always had the feeling if they’d just given
us a chance, we could do it, and that’s still necessary I think, that they
don’t give women a chance. If a man and women applied for the same job, but
she had better credentials, they would take the man. Things are changing. For
one thing, women are able to have families and still work, although that can be
very, very hard, but anyway I don’t have any more thoughts on that.

REDMAN: Okay, sort of the last thing that I’d like to ask is that over the
last couple of the decades in particular, the Rosie the Riveter image, that sort
of the iconic that “We can do it” poster or the Norman Rockwell poster, this
has come to symbolize women workers during World War II. But you mentioned
walking down to the assembly line and seeing your first Rosie the Riveter. Do
you think, I would say a lot of people would consider you a Rosie?

MCCLAIN: Probably.

REDMAN: So can you sort of reflect on this idea of Rosie the Riveter? Do you
identify with that as a Rosie now today, or do you think that those were the
women who were holding the riveting gun or do you think they were just as much
the engineers who were doing these types of programs, or the cadets?

MCCLAIN: I think they were just the same, met probably very similar experiences
with maybe not being accepted at first and then finding out that “By Jove, she
can rivet.” My husband had a woman working for him, he was a road
commissioner, and one of the crews they had, which were always all men, and so I
asked her crew boss one evening I said, “How has that worked out?” He said,
“She can do anything that a man her size can do, and she’s very welcome.”
That was good.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so you maybe saw some attitudes changing.

MCCLAIN: I think so, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, but it’s interesting then there’s kind of a tension there with
women still having to leave work and the men coming in and taking some of these
jobs back with the idea that the war time work would be temporary, but then at
the same time these people who’d sort of realized during the war that, “Wow,
she can be a draftswoman,” or “you can be a successful statistician,” so
there was, it must have been in some sense kind of a hard pill to swallow when
Douglas told you you couldn’t come back to work when you were more than three
months pregnant, is that right?

MCCLAIN: Yes, yes, well it completely surprised me, I had no idea, and I don’t
know whether it was well, women can work now I think anywhere as long as
they’re feeling well enough, and no, I don’t know, it was just a hard and
fast rule.

REDMAN: That’s so funny, well, let me ask if you could just reflect on the war
in just your life and how it fits in your life and when you think back on the
war years, what do you think about primarily?

MCCLAIN: I think I am saddest about many of the boys in high school. It’s made
me a little bit bitter with the ROTC because these boys that I remember that
were killed first were ROTC. They were officers in ROTC and then became officers
in the Army, and they weren’t ready for it.

REDMAN: Okay, so thinking about how that system works is one of the things that
stands out in your mind.

MCCLAIN: Um hm.

REDMAN: Okay, well, on that I’d like to thank you so much for sitting down
with me today and telling me so much about your life.

MCCLAIN: Well, thank you. Like I say, I enjoyed it. I know I’ve gotten off
subject a few times.

REDMAN: Oh, no, that’s great. We like that, and has it helped you recall some
different things that --

MCCLAIN: Yes, yes, it has, and when I was sitting here writing, the things I
thought, “Oh my goodness, that’s funny.” Oh, I’ll tell you one more
funny thing.

REDMAN: Great.

MCCLAIN: This professor at Minnesota confessed one day that he, we just assumed
he was married. He had a gold ring on his ring finger. He said, “Well, I’m
not married. I didn’t want to be bothered by the girls.”

REDMAN: Oh, that is so funny.

MCCLAIN: He didn’t have a personality to appeal to any of, everybody went out
of there saying he didn’t have a problem.

REDMAN: What girl would have, that is so funny.

MCCLAIN: Plus his being oh, six or seven years older, and that was a century then.

REDMAN: Right, yeah, oh, that is so funny. Well, what a good story. Well, once
again I appreciate everything. Thank you so much.

MCCLAIN: Thank you.

REDMAN: Excellent.

MCCLAIN: I hope I haven’t ruined any –
