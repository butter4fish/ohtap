FARRELL: This is Shanna Farrell with Ellen Kleidosty Roberts on Monday, November
30, 2015. This is an interview for the Rosie the Riveter Project. Ellen, can you
start by telling me where and when you were born and a little bit about your
early life?

ROBERTS: I was born April 5, 1939, in Coeur d&#039;Alene, Idaho. I had an older
brother, Wayne Henry Kleidosty, who was eighteen months older than I was. We
lived in a small house in Coeur d&#039;Alene. My mother did not work out of the
house. She was a homemaker. At the time I was born--I&#039;m not sure just exactly
when, but my father drove a bus. I believe it was the Farragut Naval Station in
Spokane. He basically transported, I would imagine, civilian workers, maybe,
from Coeur d&#039;Alene or Spokane, from that area. I don&#039;t know very much about that.

FARRELL: Do you have any early memories of Coeur d&#039;Alene?

ROBERTS: I remember the house that we lived in. It was a very small house, but
there was an unfinished upstairs. My brother and I slept up there. One memory I
have of it, we must have had a metal roof, because I remember rain pounding on
the roof. I do remember my dad sitting at the bed next to me, because I don&#039;t
know if I was afraid, or just calming or whatever. I have a memory of that. I
remember we had a garden in front of the house. The house set back in the lot,
and there was a garden in the front. There was an alley in the back, and down a
couple houses was a little girl that I played with, but it was her grandmother&#039;s
house. She lived part-time with her grandmother. When she was there, we could
run back and forth from her house to my house. Pretty much, that&#039;s about what I remember.

FARRELL: Did you grow up near extended family, or because your father was
working for the Navy, did you get transferred a lot?

ROBERTS: My mother&#039;s entire family lived in the Coeur d&#039;Alene area. She had a
sister and four brothers, I believe. My father grew up in Colville, Washington,
which is north of Spokane. It&#039;s up close to the Canadian border. He had a
brother and a sister. His sister lived in Spokane. They had two children, my
aunt in Spokane, but those cousins were older than I was. My brother and I were
the youngest, so we didn&#039;t have a whole lot of contact with them, but they all
lived in the Spokane/Coeur d&#039;Alene area.

FARRELL: How old were you when you moved to Oregon?

ROBERTS: Well, I was born in &#039;39, and the war was over in &#039;45. I would say &#039;44,
so that would make me maybe five. I was always told that my father, because he
was too old for the draft, had to work in the defense project. So he went over
to Portland. I guess that must have been the closest civil defense project. I&#039;m
not sure. He went to Portland to get a job and, I think, to find a place for us
to live. When he found a place for us to live, then my mother, my brother and I,
and my grandmother, which was my father&#039;s mother, drove from Coeur d&#039;Alene over
to Portland to join my dad. That was the only part of my extended family that
worked in the defense project. Nobody that I can recall was even in the
military, which I now see as odd, but that&#039;s the way it was.

FARRELL: Do you have any sense of what they were doing and why they weren&#039;t
involved in defense work?

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t. I really don&#039;t. After we moved to Portland in the following
ten or fifteen--well, if I was five, until I was through high school--we never
went back. We couldn&#039;t afford to go to Coeur d&#039;Alene. We didn&#039;t see much of
either side of the family maybe more than three or four times. We kept in touch,
like Christmas cards and stuff, but as far as any kind of a personal--didn&#039;t
happen. I&#039;m not sure why.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about your father? What his name was,
and maybe some of your early memories about him?

ROBERTS: His name was Lorenz Kleidosty was his last name. He was about fifteen
years older than my mother. He was born in 1902, and she was born in 1915. I
think they married shortly after she finished high school. That would have made
him close to thirty years old, I guess. That was in &#039;36, &#039;37. He would have been
close to forty, I suppose--late thirties, early forties--when he came over to
Portland. He was kind of a gentleman. He was quiet. I think he sowed his wild
oats before he met my mother, because my mother wouldn&#039;t have tolerated it. She
was pretty strict as far as partying. That&#039;s pretty much what I remember about
him. He was in charge of the family. He was the breadwinner. My mother, that I
know, did not work until we moved to Portland and she started working in the shipyards.

FARRELL: Do you have an idea of how long the gap was between your father out to
Portland to when your family followed?

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t know exactly, but it couldn&#039;t have been very long. The thing
that I&#039;ve thought about since this whole subject came up is, when we drove from
Coeur d&#039;Alene to Portland, I guess it was our only clothing and some suitcases
in the car. I don&#039;t remember any furniture. Then when we got to Vanport, I don&#039;t
know if those places were furnished, or if they bought furniture. I don&#039;t
remember any furniture moving from any place. They sold or traded or something
the house in Coeur d&#039;Alene and decided to stay in Portland, so they bought a
house in Portland. It got furnished; I don&#039;t know how.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about your mother, what her name was
and some of your early memories of her?

ROBERTS: My mother&#039;s name was Erma Williamson Kleidosty. Her father married a
woman from Iowa, and they homesteaded something like 600 acres--I remember this
because my mother used to talk about it all the time--in Montana. They had a
sheep ranch or something. I&#039;ve seen pictures of that house they lived in. There
were six in the family. Life must have really been tough. I mean, really, really
tough. She was the second youngest of the six children. When she was in high
school--it must have been her last year or so of high school--they moved to
Coeur d&#039;Alene, and she graduated from high school, and apparently, at some
point, then, she met my father. Did she work? I don&#039;t know. I have no idea.

FARRELL: Can you tell me, actually, a little bit about your older brother?

ROBERTS: My brother, my early memories of him are--it&#039;s really funny. The only
memory I have of him is--the property line where our house was in Coeur d&#039;Alene,
there was a fence. He and some friend of his used to always walk on that fence.
Now, my brother would have been--if I was five, he would have been seven, maybe.
They used to walk on that fence all the time, and the neighbor who owned that
fence would go out and yell at them. I can remember. I don&#039;t know if that was
occasionally or constantly. I don&#039;t know. But that&#039;s about the only thing I
remember about my brother.

FARRELL: What&#039;s his name?

ROBERTS: His name is Wayne Henry Kleidosty.

FARRELL: What were some of your memories of Vanport? And maybe, I guess, if you
have a recollection of what the difference is between Coeur d&#039;Alene and Vanport
when you moved there?

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t recall many differences. We were sort of a family again. I do
remember my grandmother staying with us for a short period of time. Her plan was
to go home, but I came down with the measles, so she stayed and took care of me
while I had the measles. I don&#039;t know if that maybe was less than a week. I&#039;m
not sure. I remember one night, I stayed with the woman next door, across the
hall. We lived upstairs. She did not work. Her husband--I don&#039;t even know what
he did, but she didn&#039;t work. She kept me, or I stayed with her, that one night.
She made a doll dress for one of my dolls, and I still have that dress. I do
remember that. She did it all by hand. Then there were kids in the area. I don&#039;t
remember much about them, but apparently we played in the yard. I don&#039;t think
the unit was very big. I seem to remember something about sleeping on a narrow
bed, like a cot or something, and it seems like it was in a hallway.

FARRELL: You said that you lived upstairs? Was it a duplex or a multi-family or
a complex?

ROBERTS: I&#039;m trying to think. If you&#039;re looking at it straight on, there was two
end units, and then a unit, and then there was a stairway, and then there was
two units in the middle. Up each stairway, there was a unit on either side. So
there would have been maybe eight units, something like that, eight or nine
units in this--and it was just a wood frame. The unit that we lived in faced a
grassy area and a drainage ditch. I guess there must have been a parking lot in
the back. My brother tells me that the shipyards ran something like a big old
bus. He said it was like something you hauled cattle in, apparently. That&#039;s what
he remembered. They transported workers from Vanport to the shipyards. I don&#039;t
think my folks rode it, because we went to a nursery school, they picked us up.
So I think they must have driven.

FARRELL: Your father, when he was working in Oregon, was that when he was--he
worked in the shipyards? Is that right?

ROBERTS: He worked in the shipyards. He was a welder. Once the war was over, did
they lay people off? Did he quit? I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know. I think it was
only a few months that he was there, because it seemed like it was summer, and
then I started first grade while there, and I was only there maybe a month at
their school, and then we moved over into the St. Johns area, and my brother and
I both went to school, and I, again, resumed first grade. So it couldn&#039;t have
been very long.

FARRELL: You said that your mother also went to work in the shipyards as well?

ROBERTS: She did. I don&#039;t know what the circumstances and why, unless they were
looking for workers--they both worked the second shift, the four to midnight.
The daycare must have been convenient for them, so maybe it was money-driven?
Need for workers? Again, I don&#039;t know.

FARRELL: You said your parents worked the second shift, four to midnight?

ROBERTS: Four to midnight.

FARRELL: So you were in childcare in the evening?

ROBERTS: Yeah. Yeah.

FARRELL: When we talked before, you had mentioned that you had gotten measles
and that your grandmother took care of you, and after you had recovered, you
went to daycare. Do you have any memories of having measles?

ROBERTS: I just remember with this woman, staying with her. I remember that. I
know that I didn&#039;t start day care at the same time my brother did. He started
maybe a week or so ahead of me. So by the time I started, he was already there.
They seemed to segregate us for some reason, because he was in an older group,
or a different group. Once we went through the door, I didn&#039;t see him again. My
memory is I didn&#039;t like being there. I did not like being there.

FARRELL: Do you have a sense of why you didn&#039;t like being there?

ROBERTS: I was kind of a shy crybaby, whatever. Never been away from my mother,
I suppose. I don&#039;t even remember how long we were there. But I do remember
crying, and didn&#039;t want to go. I&#039;d say my stomach hurt and I wasn&#039;t feeling
good. Didn&#039;t make a difference. I went.

FARRELL: Also, when we talked, you had some memories of cots.

ROBERTS: Yeah. Now, I guess this was a twenty-four-hour daycare. I don&#039;t know
that much about it, but we went at four o&#039;clock. I&#039;m assuming that there was
dinner that was served. I kind of remember long tables. I do remember that there
were group showers, and we put our pajamas on, and we slept in--they had cots
set up in this big--probably about the size of a, I don&#039;t know, maybe a small
gymnasium or something. There were rows and rows of cots, and we slept in--we
went to bed in these cots. Then, when my folks got off work, midnight or so,
they&#039;d come by and pick us up and wrap us up in a blanket, take us home. That
was it.

FARRELL: Do you have any memory of the diversity among your class? The boys and
girls were separated, but do you remember it being predominantly having white classmates?

ROBERTS: I have no recollection of whether they were white, and I have no
recollection if there was segregated boys and girls. I always assumed it was
segregated by age rather than sex. But I don&#039;t know.

FARRELL: Then when your parents came to pick you up, would they, the next
morning, if they didn&#039;t have to be to work until four, would they spend the day
with you?

ROBERTS: We generally slept in late, because--whatever. Then if they had errands
or going to the market, I don&#039;t remember what we did during the day, because I
think part of it was during the summer. I don&#039;t recall my brother going to
school. I don&#039;t know what we did.

FARRELL: Also when we had talked before, you had mentioned the term--that you
had just learned the term &quot;eight-hour orphans.&quot;

ROBERTS: I saw that at the Rosie the Riveter Museum, that big chart that they
have there. So I called my brother and said, &quot;Did you know we were eight-hour
orphans?&quot; And he said, &quot;No. I don&#039;t remember.&quot; But that was kind of cute. Yeah,
I could feel like an eight-hour orphan at that time.

FARRELL: Do you have an idea of how long you went to childcare for, the
childcare center?

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t. I don&#039;t, because I&#039;m not sure about when--the date that we
left Coeur d&#039;Alene and came over. The only thing I can feel is that we moved out
of there in the fall, because I had started first grade and then transferred to
another school. So it was in the fall sometime. I don&#039;t think we were there more
than a year. I really don&#039;t.

FARRELL: You would have been around six or seven, probably around six, when you
left? When you were starting first grade, were you around six then?

ROBERTS: I probably was. My birthday is in April. I don&#039;t know what the
age--would I have already been six, or would I only been five? I think I
probably already would have been six.

FARRELL: I guess that would have been right around the time that the war ended
as well.

ROBERTS: I think it was shortly before. I do remember my dad taking us down to
the shipyards for a christening of a boat. For years, my mother had with all of
her stuff, had a program of that boat being christened. I do kind of vaguely
remember that. But when that was, again, I don&#039;t know.

FARRELL: What are your memories of that, the christening of the boat?

ROBERTS: I just remember that there was a big crowd and there were speakers.
Somehow, it pushed off from the dock. I remember it pushed out into the water.

FARRELL: Did your parents keep any ephemera or things from that era that you
remember looking back on?

ROBERTS: They never talked about it. The only thing was that sledgehammer that I
took down to the Rosie museum. When we moved to Portland from Vancouver, my mom
and dad each had one. My younger sister hadn&#039;t been born yet. She&#039;s sixteen
years younger than I am. My dad&#039;s belonged to my brother, and my mom&#039;s belonged
to me. What the story I had heard was they had to make their own, these little
sledgehammers, but the handle of my mother&#039;s was very intricately wired, kind of
a woven stuff. I don&#039;t think my mother would have done that. She wasn&#039;t a
welder. She wasn&#039;t even a welder when she worked there, although that was her
title. Then there was a few union cards and ID cards and stuff that I also--that
was in that group of stuff that my mother kept. But no, they did not talk about
it at all. Never. Maybe we didn&#039;t ask, or whatever.

FARRELL: Did your dad continue, after the war had ended and you had moved to St.
Johns in Oregon--that was the neighborhood in Portland?

ROBERTS: Mm-hmm.

FARRELL: Do you remember if your dad kept working in defense or for the Navy, or
if he moved on after that?

ROBERTS: He went to work as a mechanic in a bus garage, and I think it was
called the Oregon Motor Company or something. They weren&#039;t commuter buses, but
they were more like Greyhound, from city to city, but their main shop was in
Portland, and he worked as a mechanic. How he got that training, I don&#039;t know.
Maybe from the prior--yeah, whatever.

FARRELL: And so a little bit more about Vanport. You had left Vanport and moved
to St. Johns before the war ended? Is that right?

ROBERTS: It was after the war, because I have a feeling, but again, I don&#039;t know
for sure, my folks must have been laid off. When the war was over, they had no
more use for all of those workers. They weren&#039;t building ships. I don&#039;t know if
my mother was laid off first, but both of them. At that point, again, I don&#039;t
know if they chose not to stay there or if they--I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know. But
that&#039;s when we moved over to St. Johns. It was a smooth transition. I don&#039;t
think there was anything--you know. But a lot of people were moving out of the
Vanport area, too.

FARRELL: So Vanport City, also called Kaiser, do you remember it ever being
called Kaiserville?

ROBERTS: Mm-mm.

FARRELL: No?

ROBERTS: Actually, the shipyards that my folks worked for was not a Kaiser
Shipyards. It was called the Oregon Shipyards, I believe.

FARRELL: Yeah. Was it the--I have this written down. Oh, the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation?

ROBERTS: Something like that, but it wasn&#039;t--Kaiser was on down the river closer
to central Portland.

FARRELL: I think that there were a couple.

ROBERTS: There was a couple.

FARRELL: I think Kaiser had opened one, but it wasn&#039;t called Kaiser. He owned
and opened the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation in 1941, but I think later had
other shipyards as well.

ROBERTS: Yeah, because there were two in Portland. One was the Oregon one, and
the other one was a Kaiser Shipyards.

FARRELL: That&#039;s interesting, because in some of the research I had done, people
who lived in Vanport were working in the Kaiser Shipyards. There weren&#039;t as many
who worked in the other that were moving in there. So it&#039;s possible that your
family, when people started to move out and your family moved in because a
vacancy had opened up, and it was because they were shipyard workers.

ROBERTS: Could be. I have no idea.

FARRELL: Do you remember how far the neighborhood of St. Johns is from where
Vanport was?

ROBERTS: Yeah. Probably within ten miles.

FARRELL: Portland was pretty segregated, but Vanport was as well. Do you have
any memories of the segregation or encountering black families?

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t, because I think I was just used to them living in their area,
us living in our area. I don&#039;t. I don&#039;t remember any contact with them. I do
remember my folks saying that they worked with all white--my dad worked in a
male group as a welder. My mother worked in a white female group, and all she
did was clean up the stuff off of the welds. They didn&#039;t talk much about it.

FARRELL: Then, in 1948, there was a pretty dramatic flood that wiped out Vanport
City after a dike holding back the Columbia River collapsed. Do you have any
memories of that day, or the event in general?

ROBERTS: I do remember quite a bit about it. There was a lot of vacancies there
at that point, but there were still a lot of people living there, simply because
I guess what they could afford. We were living in St. Johns. The schools closed
and totally opened up to refugees. Of course, rumors just abounded that there
was X number of people dead, the morgues were full, but I don&#039;t know if that was
ever substantiated. I don&#039;t remember that much about the death tolls. We had a
very small house, but we had a couple just for maybe a couple days until they
had relatives someplace that they were able to move to. Some of our neighbors
had families with a couple small children, and they had bigger houses than we
did, so they were able to accommodate them. I can remember one family that they
took in this couple, and they had a little boy who was pre-school. The woman
actually practically become a maid in their house for a period of time. She was
so grateful to have someplace to live and to be able to take care of her
children. I think her husband maybe worked someplace while they were looking for
a house. But then they later moved into that area down--there was a black
community down closer to Portland, and they found a place to live down there.

FARRELL: So the families that you remember your parents taking in and neighbors
taking in were predominantly black?

ROBERTS: Predominantly black, yeah. But the school, the grade school I went to,
was maybe two or three blocks away from where we lived, and they just opened up
the gymnasium, the cafeteria, wherever, and they brought in cots and stuff. I
don&#039;t know how long. It seemed like it was probably at least a week until they
were able to relocate people out of there and reestablish living conditions. I
know a lot of families took in refugees or homeless people. They had nothing.
They had no place to go.

FARRELL: Do you remember how the area changed after that?

ROBERTS: It didn&#039;t. You mean Vanport or--

FARRELL: Sort of the larger area, because Vanport was gone at that point.

ROBERTS: Vanport was gone, yeah.

FARRELL: If there were families that left or stayed.

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t know. There was black communities in the Portland area, and I
just always assumed they integrated into there. They had friends or family or
something in these black communities, and they just were able to integrate into
those communities. I guess I didn&#039;t think much about it. But as far did they
integrate in the community where I was, no, they did not.

FARRELL: Did you ever go visit the remains of Vanport, or do you remember seeing
the physical damage that was done?

ROBERTS: I just remember the newspaper articles. It was a tremendous flood. I
mean, it was a wall of flood that came down, and it was like it just kind of
wiped out everything. There were these--what I described as these apartment,
these housing--they were floating. They couldn&#039;t have been built very strong.
They were floating.

FARRELL: During that period where there was actual flooding and floating houses,
were any of the families in your community worried that the flood was going to
affect your neighborhood?

ROBERTS: As I recall, the dikes surrounded Vanport. So when this one broke, the
water went this way, and there was another one over there that kept--

FARRELL: The other parts of Portland protected? So there was a couple levels of
security there?

ROBERTS: Yeah. This area of Vanport was traditionally a floodplain. That&#039;s how I
would identify Vanport, as a floodplain. But the dike was built all around, and
the Columbia River, generally there was a lot of rain there, and it would always
raise, and it would be right up at the level. They were always worried about
those dikes breaking, always. There was a bridge that went from Portland over to
Vancouver, and the water would be right up underneath the bridge, many, many
years. They always worried about that dike breaking, always. I do think they
probably encouraged people to move after the war. Wasn&#039;t a safe place to be. But
there was just no place for people to go.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about what you mean by it wasn&#039;t a
safe place to be?

ROBERTS: Those dikes. Because of the potential for flood in the spring.

FARRELL: In some of the research that I&#039;ve done, there were some things, some
pieces of information about there was a perception that Vanport was an unsafe
neighborhood because it had a lot of black families living there. So I didn&#039;t
know if that&#039;s--

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t know anything about that. I don&#039;t know anything about that. I
think after we moved, I don&#039;t remember ever going back there to visit anybody.
The people that my folks had became friends with moved out of there. I just
don&#039;t remember.

FARRELL: Kind of getting back to your family after the war, your father kept
working, but did your mother stay in the workforce?

ROBERTS: Not for a while. I always have the feeling that my mom, she wasn&#039;t a
homemaker. She didn&#039;t love taking care of the house and being a cook. She would
rather be outside. So when I was in the third grade, she decided that we were
going to pick strawberries in the summertime. During that six-week season, we&#039;d
get up in the morning. She&#039;d herd my brother and I out, and we&#039;d pick
strawberries for the day. We&#039;d leave at six in the morning, come home and be
home at three o&#039;clock in the afternoon. We did that for my entire childhood. I
think she liked being out there. Then even after we moved over into Washington
state, she would follow my dad around, because we&#039;d bought a small farm. She
loved being outside with him. She&#039;d know somebody who needed their strawberries
hoed or something, and she&#039;d work for a few days or something. I think she just
was a woman who preferred to be in the workforce.

FARRELL: Do you remember how--I know that you were young during World War II, so
it would be hard to compare it to anything, but some of the changes that the war
brought maybe to your town, or kind of generally to the larger cultural climate?

ROBERTS: That&#039;s interesting, because I took a class at Sacremento State a few
years ago that was fifties, sixties, and seventies history, and they were
talking about, after the war, all of the development and the housing projects
they built in, and the houses that were identical, and everybody had a turquoise
refrigerator and the whole thing. It&#039;s like, where was I during that time? I
don&#039;t remember any of that kind of stuff. All these clichés about what happened
after the war. I don&#039;t remember that. I just remember that I just went to
school. We had sort of a happy little community there in Portland. My dad
actually got sick as a bus mechanic. He had worked in the coal mines up in
Washington state as a young man and had, apparently, black lungs. He got some
carbon dioxide gas poisoning, because they worked down in pits underneath these
diesel buses, the ventilation wasn&#039;t good. So he decided that he needed to move
his family out of the Portland area. He bought this small farm--actually traded
the house for the small farm--over in Washington state.

FARRELL: Do you remember any sort of feeling of patriotism, either during or
after the war, if there was much of that?

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t remember anything more than--mm-mm.

FARRELL: Any rationing that you had to do at all?

ROBERTS: I do not remember rationing. But in that stuff that my mom--those
little pieces of paper and stuff like that--there was a ration book, an empty
ration book with my name on it, and it was from Coeur d&#039;Alene. So they must have
had ration books when I was even younger than that. But ration books, did they
have them after the war ended? I don&#039;t remember. I just don&#039;t remember that.

FARRELL: Growing up, either during the war or in that period of time, what kind
of things would you do for fun?

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t remember much while we lived in Vanport, but once we moved over
to Portland, there was a whole neighborhood full of kids, and it was just
playing outside. Having a bike was a big deal. I do remember there was a girl
who was a couple years older than I was, who lived a couple doors away, and I
remember we&#039;d take the bus on a Saturday morning and go downtown Portland, and
go to Woolworths and get something to eat, go to the movies, come back home, by
ourselves. Today, you wouldn&#039;t allow your daughters to do that. We were probably
ten, twelve years old, something like that. I would go to a friend&#039;s house after
school, which might be across town--not across Portland, but across the St.
Johns community--and I&#039;d walk home, five o&#039;clock at night. That was life. There
was no fear. You weren&#039;t afraid of anything.

FARRELL: Were there any sort of lessons or things that you took from that period
of time that you kind of applied to later on, or habits that you acquired, or I
guess things that you learned in general?

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t remember anything other than just the lessons you learn from
your parents and things like that. As far as worldwide or community-wide or
anything, no. We all kind of were in the same economical situation, I guess. For
the most part, the community where I lived, the moms stayed home, and kids went
to school, and dads went to work. That&#039;s the kind of community it was.

FARRELL: What were, I guess from any period of time, some of the biggest lessons
that you learned from both of your parents, or things that you saw them do that
you tried to emulate later?

ROBERTS: They were fairly conservative. They were fairly conservative. I would
say they never had a lot of money. They were very economical. They always
debated over and over--I can remember my mother said, &quot;I&#039;m tired of looking for
a couch. Can we just buy one?&quot; It was that kind of a thing. We had a walnut tree
in the backyard, and my mother would bag walnuts and send them to her relatives
in Coeur d&#039;Alene for Christmas presents, like a bag of walnuts. That would be
their Christmas present. It&#039;s kind of interesting.

FARRELL: Are there any things that you hope that future generations take from
that period of time and remember or try to keep in mind as we move forward in time?

ROBERTS: I think people were more--I don&#039;t think &quot;patriotic&quot; is the word. I
think they cared about the country more so. They weren&#039;t so divisive. It&#039;s sort
of the feeling I get. Of course, we didn&#039;t have quite a global network as we do
now, so you really--if you were patriotic, you supported the president because
he was the president, and you didn&#039;t read a lot of negative stuff. My mom worked
on the election board, and they voted. They never missed an election. They voted
all--that&#039;s what they did. Those are the kind of things I remember.

FARRELL: Is there anything else that you want to add?

ROBERTS: I don&#039;t know. Did you get enough information from me?

FARRELL: Yeah, that was great. Thank you.
