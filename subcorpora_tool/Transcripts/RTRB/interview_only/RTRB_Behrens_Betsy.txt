FARRELL: This is Shanna Farrell, with Betsy Hess Behrens. Is that how you
pronounce your name?

BEHRENS: That&#039;s right.

FARRELL: Okay. It is Friday, April 10, 2015, and this is interview number one.
Betsy, can you start by telling me where and when you were born and a little bit
about your early life?

BEHRENS: I was born in Buffalo, New York in 1923. March 5, 1923. Well, I was
born during the Jazz Age, of course. My father was a contractor and he was doing
very well. He had built a whole lot of houses in Buffalo and Kenmore, which is
right adjacent to Buffalo. Everything was going fine. They held a lot of second
mortgages on the houses and when the crash came, nobody could pay. Only one man
paid off. Because he was a dentist, we got free dental care all my childhood, to
help him pay off; but the others defaulted and my father and his partner went
into bankruptcy. My father&#039;s partner committed suicide, and that left my father
stuck with the whole thing. It was a very dreary time. I remember having to
watch every penny. My father would resole our shoes. I remember seeing my mother
crying, working on the books, trying to figure out how to make the money last.
My father took a job as an insurance salesman, at the same time, and he went
back to school to get his teaching certificate. Anyhow, it was just chaotic.

I remember one Christmas, when radios were quite new, they bought a little table
radio. But they warned us children that it was our Christmas present. They could
buy us a present, but they couldn&#039;t buy anything for the house for themselves
because of bankruptcy. I remember feeling that wasn&#039;t quite right, it wasn&#039;t
quite fair. But on the other hand, the radio was the only thing that kept you in
touch with --. As far as knowing what went on, we got two papers a day: the
morning paper, the Buffalo Courier-Express, and evening paper, Buffalo Daily News.

We managed to eke out enough money to go to a movie every week, but that&#039;s
because you got free dishes. You&#039;d get a cup and saucer one week and a plate
another week. I don&#039;t even remember what the pattern was. But anyhow, we&#039;d see
Buck Rogers of the 25th Century and Tarzan and all kinds of things like that.
But that was our only luxury, to go once in a while to the movies. But I could
go on and on about what the Depression years are like, and the constant
impression it has. It&#039;s never left me. I can&#039;t spend money, because everything
was made over, make do. Sometimes I look at all the waste nowadays and I&#039;m just
appalled because we didn&#039;t waste anything. I remember one summer, we couldn&#039;t
afford any meat. My father had an Oakland Landau sedan. It had four doors and
the doors all opened out from the middle. He invented a tent-like construction
that went on top of the car and the four posts to the tent fit down into the
hinges of the car. During the daytime, we would keep our luggage up there and
he&#039;d pull the posts down far. At night, he&#039;d pull the posts up, take the luggage
out, and we three children would sleep up there. That&#039;s the way we traveled one
summer. They didn&#039;t have to spend any money on entertainment; we went and looked
at free historical places of the Northeast, and further down, to Washington. No,
to Gettysburg. So we got history lessons and had a good time and had a wonderful
summer, but we just ate out of little sort of cabinets that Daddy attached to
the back of the car. Mother would fix little snacks and that. When it was really
bad weather, we&#039;d stay in a little cabin. They were, I think, fifty cents a
night or something like that, at the most, and we&#039;d all pile into one cabin.

Well, anyhow, they were hard times. I could go on and on, because you have
probably [heard] lots of stories about the Depression. But education was very
important and my father started teaching school at Technical High school, day
and night. He started teaching three nights a week, and days, also, and he had
an insurance business besides. Then he started working for his Master&#039;s degree.
So education and schooling was always part of our background. My mother was a
great storyteller and she would keep us occupied. We had a table that was
enamel. White enamel, I guess it was, in the kitchen. Porcelain? I&#039;m trying to
think what it was made of. But anyhow, after dinner, when Daddy was away
teaching, if we cleared off the table very quickly and did the dishes, Mama
would tell us a story and illustrate it with a pencil, a soft pencil, on this
white table. Then after she told the story, we&#039;d have to wipe it off with Bon
Ami, so it would be ready for the next morning, when it always had a tablecloth
on it. Then she&#039;d tell us stories at night, to help us go to sleep. She sat in
the hall. Our doors opened out into the hall and she&#039;d sit there under a little
hall light and make up stories to tell us.

The toys, we didn&#039;t have much in the way of toys. We&#039;d get one book at Christmas
and we&#039;d get shoes for Christmas. I&#039;m not sure whether we&#039;d get --. Shoes at
Easter, I guess. Then in the fall, we&#039;d get shoes to go to school. Well, I could
go on and on and on. There&#039;s no end to telling what life was like. But for us,
it was mostly reading and telling stories and Mother drawing. My father brought
home a lot of cigar boxes from some store, some man he knew, and we used those
like building blocks. We would built little structures in the basement and then
knock them down. Everything was what you could make, or make out of things, but
we didn&#039;t have much in the way of store-bought toys, like they do nowadays.

FARRELL: Can you tell me how many siblings you had, what their names were, and a
little bit about some of your memories of them as a child?

BEHRENS: I had a brother two years older. His name was Robert. He became a
designer. He was an industrial designer, and he also designed houses. He moved
back east, to the East Coast. But he was a wonderful dancer. Because of him --he
was two years older than I was --there were always lots of kids around, boys and
girls. It was fun. My father made his own beer and his own wine, in the
basement. If we kids helped him make the beer or bottled it, then he would make
root beer for us and we&#039;d bottle it. So that&#039;s how we got through. So there was
always free root beer at our house. You&#039;d buy a little jar of Hires Root Beer,
little-bitty things. Just seems like it wasn&#039;t much bigger than this. It was an
extract, and you&#039;d mix it with water, I don&#039;t know what all. But it was
delicious root beer.

My sister was two years younger. Her name was Doris. Our last name, well, that
was interesting. It was Milkie; the German name is M-U with an umlaut-H-L-K-E.
[pronounces it:] Muelke, sort of. When they came over, I guess a lot of the
immigration officials at Ellis Island couldn&#039;t read the script and couldn&#039;t
understand the pronunciation, so they just called it Milky, M-I-L-K-I-E. When my
father went to the university and studied German, the professor said, &quot;That
isn&#039;t a real German name, M-I-L-K-I-E.&quot; They got out immigrations papers and
discovered the correct spelling. So my father changed it to, (not with the
umlaut and everything) but an Americanized version of the sound, which was
M-U-E-L-K-E, Muelke. His father was happy to have the real right name that
sounded better. But his brother was furious, because he said my father was
putting on airs. He was jealous because my father went to college and he didn&#039;t,
and he was mad at my father for talking his father into changing the spelling.
It just mixed up everything for him. So that was it. But even though it was
spelled M-U-E-L-K-E, all during school, kids called me Betsy Milkie. One boy --I
remember his name, Junior DeCoot --used to taunt me with, &quot;Betsy Milkie, the cow
girl. Ha, ha, ha.&quot; So anyhow, my sister is two years younger. She was born
August 1, 1925. My brother was born April 3, 1921. Yeah.

All of our grandparents lived in the city. Every Sunday, we went to church and
then we went to my mother&#039;s parents and had dinner. Usually homemade chicken
soup and chicken and stuff like that. Then we&#039;d chat and do the dishes and that.
Around three o&#039;clock, we&#039;d go to my father&#039;s mother and father and take them for
a ride. That&#039;s what they loved to do. The grownups would talk German. I don&#039;t
know what they talked about because we kids couldn&#039;t understand it. But Grandma
would make Pflaumkuchen, she called it. It&#039;s like a coffee cake. We loved that.
We kids would run around out in the yard, when it was nice. In the house, there
was nothing for us to do, except there were two books. One was a joke book, like
&quot;when&#039;s a door not a door? When it&#039;s ajar.&quot; There was another upside-down book.
When you&#039;d turn it upside-down, the face would be frowning and so forth. That
was all there was to do in there. We memorized those two books, I guess. But
that was our background.

FARRELL: You had mentioned that education was important in your family. Can you
tell me a little bit about your time in grade school, maybe what your favorite
subject were, or if you had any teachers that were influential?

BEHRENS: We started kindergarten in a former church. That was only one year.
Then the church was sold and a brand new elementary school was built. It was
Public School Number 81. It was unbelievable. It was, of course, during the &#039;30s
and during Roosevelt&#039;s time. I deplore the schools, the public schools my
children went to, compared to that school. It was magnificent. We had an
auditorium that had seating on an angle, so everybody could see, and regular
seats that folded up and had an arm rest. There were WPA murals on the wall.
Beautiful murals of the pilgrims, and I think there were Indians but I don&#039;t
remember that. But I remember all the color, and on both walls. The stage had
velvet curtains and footlights and wings. It was just unbelievably beautiful.
One whole part of the top floor of the school was for art, and we had a great
big art room, with storage and tables, and sinks to clean up afterwards.
Everybody had to take art; it was a regular part of the curriculum. In addition,
we had a music teacher --full-time --and we had an orchestra and a band.

There was another whole room for girls, for domestic arts, it was called. In the
seventh grade, you learned how to cook and how to keep house, even how to do
dishes properly. There were four sinks, four beds, and you learned how to miter
the corners, how to make a bed properly, and the order in which you did dishes.
And we had to learn to cook. We had little books. Every week, or whenever it
was, we&#039;d get little written pieces about --I can remember for example --how to
make a basic white sauce. That was in seventh grade. We learned to be good
housekeepers. In eighth grade, we learned sewing. We had four sewing machines.
And we had to learn how to darn socks. We had to learn how to make all different
kinds of mending. Right angle tear. We had to learn how to make all different
kinds of seams. I remember a flat fell seam and a French seam. At the end of the
year, we had to, each of us, make a garment that we could wear for ourselves. I
don&#039;t know what possessed me, but --people made a blouse or a skirt or something
--I decided to make a two-piece wool suit that was lined. It was the most
God-awful-looking thing. It was beautifully made. I was very [precise]. I love
sewing. But I was so skinny. I was anemic, so I didn&#039;t have much color anyhow,
and it was brown wool, which was an awful color for me. And a straight skirt. I
have a picture of me wearing that. I was so proud of it, and I look like a
skinny little nothing. It was terrible. But it was fun making it. I was very
proud of that. But in addition, while the girls took domestic arts, the boys had
manual training, they called it. They had a whole metal workshop and a wood
workshop, in the basement of the school. We were really being prepared to be
homemakers. They learned how to use all the tools that they&#039;d need for metalwork
and woodwork.

Then in addition, we had two gymnasiums, completely outfitted. They were never
used for anything but gym. And changing rooms, little shower rooms, for the boys
and the girls. I think, if I remember right, the gyms were separated by a
movable wall, partitions. I think I remember for seventh grade, we had a dance,
and we were able to move the walls aside, so we could have one great big space
for the dance. There was a theme for the dance. It was, I think, the pilgrim
period. I remember everyone was wearing fancy dresses. It was probably 17-
1800s, and everyone had big full skirts and stuff their mothers made however
they could. I had in my head I was going to be a pioneer woman. I had a straw
hat and a pipe, and I carried my brother&#039;s BB gun. I don&#039;t know what got into
me, but anyhow, that&#039;s what happened. People came around every week to teach
musical instruments, band or orchestra instruments. I had to take violin lessons
--and so did my brother and so did my sister --because we owned a violin; my
father had one. Although I desperately wanted to take piano lessons. Piano
lessons, you had to take outside of school, and they were a dollar. Violin
lessons were only fifty cents in school, so we all learned to play the violin.
But none of us particularly liked it. But at least we learned something about
music. They had a solo club. And a great big playground and a cafeteria.

There was a huge cafeteria, where people could eat lunch; but most everybody
went home for lunch if they lived near enough because they couldn&#039;t afford to
eat in the cafeteria. But it was there. When I think of all everything we had
available to us --. My children, at one point, went to school down in Palo Alto.
They had room called a multipurpose room, and that&#039;s all. They had fold-up
chairs, so if they had any kind of a show or something, you&#039;ll pull the chairs
out. I remember going to an art class there. They had only --what was it --fifty
minutes. That was all the time they had to set up the art stuff, have their art,
clean up afterwards and leave. That&#039;s ridiculous. They had to leave it spotless
for the next class, which might be, I don&#039;t know, some history class or program
or whatever. I think during the Depression, what Roosevelt made available to us,
compared to what, in an upper class or whatever you want to call it, affluent
neighborhood like Palo Alto, how little they had --it&#039;s just astonishing. So
anyhow, did I answer your question?

FARRELL: You did. So then you, after that, had gone to Buffalo State Teachers
College. Was that right after high school?

BEHRENS: Yeah.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit about your decision to go to Teachers
College and your experience there?

BEHRENS: Well, my father had been a teacher, and his cousin Edna --I can&#039;t
remember her last name --had been a teacher. My father talked me into going. I
had no desire to be a teacher, but I didn&#039;t know what else to do. Well, this is
interesting. In high school, I can clearly remember in the senior year, they had
two weeks where men came to talk to the boys, from all different professions.
They got a very in-depth look at what was available. For the girls, we had a
secretary, a woman who worked in domestic arts, and a teacher and a nurse.
That&#039;s all. One day, that took care of us. That&#039;s all the career information
that was available to us then. So of all the ones that seemed available, well, I
just thought, my father wanted me to be a teacher and follow in his footsteps,
so I went. It was the most ghastly experience of my life. I told you a little
bit about it earlier. Do you want me to tell --?

FARRELL: Sure, yeah.

BEHRENS: Well, to start with, now, psychology was very new at that time. This is
1940. There was a psychology teacher and everybody had to take a psych class
from her. But she started out, when you came in as a freshman, you had to have
an IQ test and a personality test and I don&#039;t remember what all. We were all
given an identification number. We had to go to assembly and they took
attendance. We had to sit in certain places in the assembly and they took
attendance, which was a regimentation that was infuriating, to start with. She
had put together a profeel, she called it --she didn&#039;t call it a &quot;profile,&quot; it
was a &quot;profeel&quot; --of everybody, that included your IQ, your personality test,
your attitude, and your grade.

Then she called in all the freshmen one by one, to tell them their report. You
had to sit there waiting till your number came up, and compare yourself with all
the other freshmen in the class. It was a hell of a thing to do to young kids.
She called me up and she said, &quot;Well, my dear, you don&#039;t have a high enough IQ
to qualify for being a college student.&quot; She said, &quot;You don&#039;t show any interest
in your classes, your effort is very low.&quot; She said, &quot;But, you&#039;re very
successful. Your grades are very high.&quot; She said, &quot;Now, how do we account for
this, my dear?&quot; She said, &quot;It can only figure one thing: it&#039;s your personality.&quot;
Then she said, &quot;And 9/10th of your personality, we have to admit, was your
looks.&quot; Then she said, &quot;Someday you&#039;ll be middle-aged and you&#039;ll discover you&#039;re
nothing but an empty shell.&quot; That&#039;s what my psychology teacher told me at
Teachers [College]. I&#039;m quoting verbatim. That was it.

Well, it turns out that I didn&#039;t want to take the IQ test; I didn&#039;t think I
should have to. A friend had to push me in the door and close the door after me.
I don&#039;t even remember taking it, I was so furious about the whole thing, all
this testing at this level. Any student that didn&#039;t seem to come out right,
according to this, she would call them in for a private consultation. She wasn&#039;t
a therapist; she didn&#039;t have the legal right to do it. In fact, one boy
committed suicide, I remember. But anyhow, that was one teacher.

Then another teacher --it was history of Western civilization --I asked her a
question once and she said, &quot;The children will never ask you that.&quot; I remember
saying, &quot;Well, I don&#039;t have the education of a child. I want the education of an
adult.&quot; In art class, we had to draw a picture of a human being, just so
--thenteacher said --she could get an idea of where we were at. I had been going
to the Art Institute, the Albright Art Institute Albright-Knox Art Gallery, and
the Art Institute of Buffalo, and so I worked really hard to make a life
drawing. She said, &quot;My dear, we can&#039;t all be Rembrandts. The children won&#039;t make
anything out of that.&quot; She said, &quot;You have to make sausage arms, like a sausage
where the elbow is and where the knees are, and a big round balloon for the
head.&quot; So during my lunch hour, I just made a sausage person and got an A.

And the music teacher was deaf! We didn&#039;t learn anything about music, but we had
to come in and show how we would teach a song to the children by using our
hands. [sings] I had a little donkey that&#039;s gray. I feed it in the barn
everyday. And when it hears me whistle, it knows I have a thistle. It&#039;d rather a
thistle than hay. Hee-haw, hee-haw. That is all my donkey can say. Got an A.
Well, the children could follow that and I had the words right, and that was it.
I remember one boy. We had to give a report of something we&#039;d read in the paper,
something related to music. I remember somebody giving a report talking about an
opera that was being shown. It was Die Walkure by Wagner. She accepted that,
&quot;Dye Walliker, by Wagner.&quot; The whole thing was insane. The science teacher, to
make it interesting when he was teaching astronomy, every time he&#039;d have to
refer to the sun, he&#039;d say, &quot;The raging sea, the spitting monster.&quot; That was the
sun. It was terrible. After a half year, I wanted to quit and my father wouldn&#039;t
let me. He said, &quot;You need to have a full year, in order to transfer any
credit.&quot; So I quit and worked in factories, to save up money.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit about getting a job in a factory?

BEHRENS: Well, that was sort of strange. The first job, I saw an ad in the paper
for a tracer at Worthington Pump and Machinery Corporation. I think it started
out making pumps, during the heyday of the Erie Barge Canal, and for steam
engines and that. I don&#039;t remember much what they made for the war effort. Now,
this was 1941. But it was a war industry at the time, in Buffalo. But it was
just steam pumps. What did I know? What did I care about it? I just needed a job
as a tracer. But I didn&#039;t know anything about tracing. My father taught drafting
at Technical High School, so the night before my appointment, I asked my dad, I
said, &quot;Hey, Dad, I&#039;ve got an appointment with Mr. Shwander at Worthington Pump
and Machinery. I&#039;ve got to take in a sample of my work.&quot; Well, he always had
tracing paper and tools and drafting tools. I said, &quot;Would you show me how?&quot; He
said, &quot;Kids take a year to study drafting and tracing.&quot; He said, &quot;You want me to
show you in one night?&quot; He was just furious. &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I&#039;ve got the
appointment tomorrow, I&#039;ve got to take something in.&quot; I knew I was dexterous
with my hands because I had been taking art classes for a couple years. So he
got out some --in those days, it was linen, sort of --it was a material that was
filled with some kind of goopy stuff that made it hard. I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve
ever seen tracing paper.

FARRELL: Yeah.

BEHRENS: Well, anyhow, it was fixed with something that took the ink
beautifully. So I made a drawing that night, and I went to bed and got up the
next morning and went in. Saw Mr. Shwander and he said, &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;This
is fine work. Where did you study?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, my father taught me.&quot; &quot;And
who is your father?&quot; I told him and he said, &quot;Oh, well,&quot; he said, &quot;He sends me a
lot of students from Tech High School.&quot; He said, &quot;How long did you study?&quot; I
didn&#039;t want to lie, but I couldn&#039;t say, just last night, so I said, &quot;Well, on an
off for about a year.&quot; It was true; it was off all year, but on just the night
before. But I felt I had saved my soul that way. So I got the job. I have a
picture of the first tracing I did when I got there. It&#039;s huge. It&#039;s a great big
thing like this. I have the blueprint of it and I couldn&#039;t find it for today.
I&#039;ll try to find it. But I sat down at this high stool in the drafting room,
with all these people hard at work, and I looked at this great big thing I was
supposed to copy. I thought, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m going to do. I don&#039;t know
what to do. Well, nothing to do but just start. So I started. Went in and worked
the other. When I got through he said, &quot;You&#039;re finished already?&quot; I had been so
terrified that I wasn&#039;t going to get it done in time, I wouldn&#039;t even be able to
do it at all, that I just must&#039;ve been going on high octane of some sort, of
just terror that I would be found out. So it worked out.

FARRELL: Why a tracer?

BEHRENS: Well, they were making the pumps. The workers had to have blueprints to
work from. We had to learn how to make blueprints, too. So in the drafting room,
we would put together the designs and make them into blueprints that would then
be given into the factory workers to make the pumps.

FARRELL: Oh, why did you decide that you wanted to be a tracer, as opposed to
taking a different job?

BEHRENS: [laughs] I didn&#039;t know how to do anything! I tried taking typing and I
was no good at it. I couldn&#039;t catch on to shorthand. I hadn&#039;t any skills. I
could sew. If I had known where to go to make clothes --. But I didn&#039;t. I knew I
was handy with a pen or pencil or charcoal or whatever, so I figured --. And
there was a job opening. It wasn&#039;t easy to get a job. All during high school, I
worked as a salesgirl in department stores, on weekends. In those days --you
won&#039;t believe it --you had to wear high heels. I can remember going home on the
streetcar and taking my shoes off on the streetcar, and walking home carrying my
high heels because my feet hurt so much. I tore up my stockings. We didn&#039;t have
nylons, we had silk stockings. I had to mend my silk stocking, because I had
made holes in them walking home in them. You always mended them. You never would
throw them out, until they became too funny looking, with all the mends and the
runs and everything.

FARRELL: What were some of the things that you were tracing? Do you remember?

BEHRENS: Well, it was all the pumps.

FARRELL: It was all pumps, okay.

BEHRENS: The different parts of the pumps. Because that&#039;s all they made there,
were these pumps. I don&#039;t know enough how they were used. But I tried to Google
it to find out, but I didn&#039;t use all the right inquiring questions, I don&#039;t
think. But it was probably for battleships because the pumps had to do with
pumping. I don&#039;t know. But in those days, you didn&#039;t think about it; you just
had a job. I don&#039;t know. I would have to investigate a little further to see
where Worthington pumps were used during the war, but it was a war industry;
that&#039;s all I know.

FARRELL: Do you remember any of the other industries in either the shipyards or
by the waterfront or the industrial center of Buffalo, if they grew or --? What
are your memories of them during wartime?

BEHRENS: Oh, well, this was a big thing for Buffalo because it had suffered
terribly during the Depression because the steel industry and the granaries --.
One of the big troubles that Buffalo had, it had been the conduit for --. Things
that had landed on the East Coast went down the Erie Barge Canal and ended up in
Buffalo to be processed and so forth. From Buffalo, they could go on Lake Erie
and through the lakes to Detroit and Chicago and so forth. But the Erie Barge
Canal was closed after the St. Lawrence Freeway came through. Buffalo had a very
hard time during the war. I once looked it up, but I don&#039;t remember all the
details. But it was really grim.

The Chevrolet plant --well, I think I made a note here to remember what they
made. Yeah. The P-40 was known as a Tomahawk, a Kittyhawk or the Warhawk. That
was one of the famous planes during the war. The Curtiss-Wright engines were
made there. That really helped Buffalo to stay alive. It was a huge plant. I
worked there. I left my tracing job at Worthington, which I loved, and I loved
the people there. They put a little radio in the garbage cans by their desk, by
the chief draftsman. Everybody would have to go to him for questions about what
they were doing, so nobody ever questioned people gathering around the chief
draftsman&#039;s desk, but we were all just listening to the radio in the garbage
can, in the wastebasket.

I developed an eye problem and I couldn&#039;t work any longer. That just broke my
heart, because I loved working there. So then I got a job at the Chevrolet
plant, which brought a lot of money to Buffalo and employed lots of people. That
is a really most interesting part of my life as a factory worker. I don&#039;t
remember applying for the job; I just knew I would take any job. I needed it
because I was determined to save money to go to the University of Chicago.
That&#039;s why I was working at the time. The first job they put me on, I wish I
knew more about it because at the time, [but] it was just a job. I didn&#039;t know
anything about engines and stuff.

There was a moving conveyor belt with a great big engine on top of it, moving
along. At my end of the conveyor belt, I had to get a ladder and attach --.
Somehow, I had to attach a ladder to this engine. Climb up to the ladder, to the
very top, which was way high off the ground, and with a torque wrench, torque a
big nut or something at the top as hard as I could, to a certain tolerance; then
climb down, detach the ladder, and have it ready for the next engine that came
through --all within a short space of time. You were just climbing up, climbing
down, with the big wrench, torque. After a couple of days, I just couldn&#039;t do
it. I weighed 105 pounds or something like that, just a little teenager. I went
to the foreman. I said, &quot;I&#039;m sorry, the speed at which you have to do it and the
strength to pull that big torch wrench, I --.&quot; He said, &quot;You get a man&#039;s pay,
you do a man&#039;s job.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;ll do a man&#039;s job somewhere
else in the factory, but I can&#039;t do this one.&quot;

I found out after I quit that the man who&#039;d had the job before was a big,
hulking African American, who&#039;d been a boxer. And he quit because it was too
demanding and too hard. So they gave me a job then with an electric drill. I
figured I must&#039;ve been drilling at least a half an hour and I&#039;d find I&#039;d only
been drilling for ten minutes. It was so repetitious, so nothingness. An animal
could&#039;ve done it. In fact, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a robot job now. And the screeching of
the metal in the drill. They never had anybody have ear plugs or anything, or
mask, nothing. The only thing, we had to wear our hair in either a kerchief or a
snood. I don&#039;t know if you know what a snood is, but it&#039;s a little net kind of
basket sort of thing, a soft net with a ribbon at each end. You take your hair
in it, in the little basket part, then you&#039;d pull the ribbon up and tie it in a
bow on top, and that would keep your hair all in. That was called a snood. I
have a picture of me in my outfit that I wore -- I&#039;ll have to look for that, too
--with the snood and the little baseball style hat.

Anyhow, I complained about that job, too. I said, &quot;Well, I want to work for you,
but I can&#039;t do this; it&#039;s too boring.&quot; We put in nine hours a day, and we had
two days off a month. But that was the general idea; people worked hard. So I
said, &quot;I&#039;ve got to have a job that&#039;s more interesting.&quot; So this is the job he
put me on, a vertical milling machine. Now, I don&#039;t know if you know what that
is. It was milling out portions of a master rod. Again, I didn&#039;t know much about
it. What did I know about machines? But there was a big, huge machine, and about
waist high was this bed, set down in like that. Then you&#039;d have this
twenty-pound master rod. The conveyor belt was down low. You&#039;d bend over, pick
up that twenty-pound master rod, lift it up, and then bend over this machine and
fit it on the central post, and then drop it in. Can you imagine the pull on
your back? Especially a little girl like I was. I was only just a teenager. I
didn&#039;t know. But lifting it to fit it, so it would go down. Then you&#039;d work
whatever levers or buttons; I don&#039;t remember now. It would drill out the
different spaces around, of the master rod, for the other --. Any man listening
to this is probably just cringing right now.

But after I worked on that a little while, the foreman came over. He said, &quot;Oh,&quot;
he said, &quot;you&#039;re doing a great job. You&#039;ve really found the right job for you.&quot;
He said, &quot;Now you can do two.&quot; I said, &quot;I guess I can.&quot; So I&#039;m bending down,
putting the one in, getting it set, going down to the next one, moving it, and
then dropping it back down on the conveyor belt, then going over here. I was
just [pants] like that. After a while, &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;you&#039;re ready to do
three.&quot; So here I am, bending down, putting them on, moving to the next one,
then the next one, then going back again, until I had all of the master rods
finished. But bending down. Then the union boss came around. He said, &quot;What the
hell are you doing?&quot; I said, &quot;I&#039;m doing my job the best I can. I get a man&#039;s
pay, I&#039;m doing a man&#039;s work.&quot; He said, &quot;That job is for only one milling machine
at a time.&quot; He said, &quot;You don&#039;t realize. You&#039;re young. After the war&#039;s over,
you&#039;re going to quit. You&#039;re not going to be here anymore.&quot; He said, &quot;But the
older guys, this is their life. They have to go home and mow their lawns and
take care of their families.&quot; He said, &quot;They can&#039;t keep up three milling
machines.&quot; He said, &quot;This job is designated for just one milling machine, that&#039;s
all.&quot; He said, &quot;You&#039;re changing the quota indefinitely.&quot; He said, &quot;You&#039;ve got to
quit doing that.&quot; So here I was, with the company on one side and the union on
the other side. I think I went back down to two. I don&#039;t remember exactly how it
ended, but it was a disaster.

FARRELL: But you decided not to quit.

BEHRENS: No, I couldn&#039;t because I was trying to save money and I had gone
through a couple of different jobs. So I stayed on, but I think I went back to
two milling machines instead of three. But it was the most fascinating job,
because [of] the people that worked in my area. One was an Indian chief. There
was an Indian reservation right near Buffalo. I think it was the Iroquois. He
told me all about what life was like on the reservation, about his role as the
chief, and how the money meant so much; that they lived in just tar paper
shacks. Then there was a Jewish furrier from New York. He would tell me about
living in New York and about what his life had been life, trying to make a
living as a furrier. And there was a young girl who had been raised in a
convent, and never saw any man except the priest, in all her years. When she was
eighteen, she was given some clothes to wear, just one outfit and a little bit
of money, and just sent out, goodbye. She had ended up as a prostitute, until
she found this job. It was a new chance for her. She didn&#039;t know anything about
what went on. She didn&#039;t know what prostitution was. She had to feed herself.
She was an orphan, and that&#039;s all she knew.

But now, here&#039;s an interesting part of it. I went to art school, nights. I was
married by this time. I got married when I was nineteen, to my high school
sweetheart. He worked for Bell Airplane Factory in Buffalo and I worked here at
the Chevrolet plant. We lived upstairs of the Art Institute of Buffalo, Buffalo
Art Institute, and I took classes in the evening. There was this magnificent
artist. Oh, God, he was good! His name was Oliver Lomax. But he was black. I
never knew any black people and there weren&#039;t any black people in my life.
Buffalo was a very segmented city. As matter of fact, when I took an
anthropology course at one time, I did a paper on the setup of Buffalo. It was
segmented. On the West Side, near the Peace Bridge, was the Italian section.
There was the old German section, what they called the Orchard, because all the
streets were named like Apple and Peach Street and that. There was a Jewish
section, and there was a Polish section. In fact, it was called Buffalo pole,
and they had their own government. They could pass laws and do everything, as
long as it didn&#039;t conflict with Buffalo laws. You could live and die, and never
leave Buffalo pole. In fact, I was in school with a young fellow --Al Orlowsky
was his name --from Buffalo pole. He was in a special program for exceptionally
bright people. He said to me once, &quot;Doesn&#039;t matter how good a scholar I am or
how smart I am, I&#039;m never going to make it, because I can&#039;t get rid of my
accent.&quot; It was just a heavy Polish accent because he&#039;d lived there.

So anyhow, Oliver Lomax and his wife became friends of my husband and me at the
Art Institute and we went to their house once, in the black part of Buffalo,
which was just an enclave by itself. I never saw black people. I didn&#039;t live in
a neighborhood that was rich enough to have servants and they shopped mostly in
their own area. Sometimes you&#039;d see them downtown, maybe, but they didn&#039;t even
--. The Depression was so bad that to get a job as an elevator operator, you had
to have a college degree. It wasn&#039;t prejudice or anything, people just lived
separately. They might as well have been different countries. You just didn&#039;t
see other people. Except the Indians. They would come in in the spring and sell
violets. They&#039;d sit on the street corners with big bunches of violets and sell
them. And sassafras, I think --roots. But there again, you didn&#039;t think about it
much one way or another. They were just part of the scene. It sounds terrible,
but that&#039;s the way it was. People would go out to look at the reservation, but
in the &#039;30s, there was no thought about integrating. They lived in their world;
everybody lived in their own little world.

BEHRENS: But anyhow, Oliver worked at the Chevrolet plant, too, and I went to
see him during my lunch break. I thought, well, I&#039;ll have lunch will Oliver it
would be nice. I went to see him once or twice at his station. He never came up
to mine. But then I was called a &quot;nigger lover.&quot; That was what was bandied
around. People went by and threw things at me. I was called into the boss&#039;s
office and was going to be fired. I explained to him. I said, &quot;I&#039;m a married
woman. My husband is a friend of Oliver&#039;s.&quot; Anyhow, he didn&#039;t fire me. I was
able to stay on my job. It was very unpleasant. Not too long after that, I had
saved up enough money and moved to Chicago, to go to the university.

FARRELL: Did you see those racial tensions play out in other ways in the
factories? Or did you see other types of discrimination at work?

BEHRENS: Well, the black people all ate by themselves. There were never any
riots or anything. I was shocked. I have no idea I couldn&#039;t go visit my friend.
Like I said, everything was so separated. There weren&#039;t any blacks in my school.
I just didn&#039;t --I was dumb. I was just a silly little girl, making some money to
go to [school]. It&#039;s hard, in retrospect, knowing the history and having the
consciousness that I have now. It&#039;s quite different from a little kid, a young
woman, who hated the Teachers College and was trying to save money and
contribute to the war effort. But I don&#039;t think I was even thinking much about
the war effort, at that time. It was a job that was available. I didn&#039;t have
anybody close to me who was in the war. I know I was very conscientious about my
work, because I knew it was for the war effort. I was meticulous.

I don&#039;t know what to say. I don&#039;t want to sound shallow, but I didn&#039;t think
about race relations. I was just working and doing my thing, and Oliver was a
friend. I don&#039;t know if there was much in the way of racial tension in Buffalo.
I just don&#039;t remember anything about it. As I say, people lived in their own
little areas. But that was pretty shocking to me and I remember when I went into
the president or the boss or whoever it was, I can remember going into his
office being furious and very indignant. It wasn&#039;t a cause. I wasn&#039;t trying to
prove anything; I was just trying to disprove something. Because I just never
thought about it causing any trouble. I was shocked to be labeled. I said,
&quot;Well, you can come to my house and meet my husband. He works at Bell,&quot; and so
forth. So anyhow, that was that.

Then when I went to the university, I had different jobs for a while. But then I
went to work for Dodge, the Dodge plant where they made superchargers for the
B-29 bomber. If I had known what it was going to be used for --. That was the
airplane that bombed Hiroshima. But I didn&#039;t know that at the time, of course.
In fact, it was right after I left there that the bombing took place. But I was
working in the subassembly of the supercharger of the B-29 bomber. That was one
of the best jobs I ever had. I loved it. I had a great big bin --it must&#039;ve been
about this big --and it had all compartments. In the compartments were different
pieces that had to go into the assembly, subassembly of the supercharger. Now,
what the big assembly is, I don&#039;t know, but this had something --. There were
all different kinds of cotter pins and nuts and bolts. Some things were blue
steel and some were copper and some were brass. It was just magnificent. I had
to pick out all these things and put them together and put them in the right
place. Then I would send them across the table, to the fellow who did the
wiring. So they all had to be wired together somehow. We had a very strict
tolerance that they had to measure up to.

The thing is, I had a feeler gauge that I would use to check the tolerance, and
I forget what else --calipers or something. If it didn&#039;t meet the
specifications, then I had a little grinder that I would do, to fit it. I
remember thinking, this has got to be perfect, because it&#039;s going to go into an
airplane and somebody&#039;s going to be flying that airplane. I can&#039;t have anything
wrong. So I remember being so anxious about having --. But to think of it
nowadays. They would never check tolerances and that with feeler gauges and
things, like I did. But the only thing I remember about the people I worked with
--. It was a different sort of a situation.

But there was a Russian fellow. He was always trying to teach me to sing, [sings
in Russian]. He would just nearly weep because I couldn&#039;t get it right. I
remember him bleaching his hair, because he had always been blonde and he wanted
still to look young, so he told me he bleached it. I went to work at four in the
afternoon. I&#039;d have to take a streetcar and then transfer somewhere, to get out
to the plant. It was out in South Chicago somewhere. I have some statistics here
on it. It was the largest, under one roof, in the country. They built engines
for the B-29 super something. It was 6.3 million square feet, and thirty city
blocks; that&#039;s how big it was. That was a huge plant. You could easily get lost
in it. It was Dodge Chicago. What&#039;s that super --? Looks like super fabulous,
but that isn&#039;t it. But I wrote it in a hurry.

FARRELL: What were some of the differences between working at the Chevy plant
and then working at the Dodge plant?

BEHRENS: Well, for one thing, I was older and more tired. But the Chevy plant
was not too far for me to get to. The Dodge plant, I remember coming home in the
winter at --. Well, I went to work at four; it must&#039;ve been three or four in the
morning, because we worked nine hours. I remember standing on the street corner
in the snow, in the middle of the night, waiting for the next streetcar. It was
huge, as I say. That was why I gave you those figures, because it was a huge
place. I don&#039;t remember so much the whole plant, because it was so big. I just
remember my little table and the man across from the table. He was a black
fellow. The only thing I remember --we didn&#039;t talk much because we were so busy
and it was the middle of the night --but he had the longest, most beautiful
fingers, and I used to love to watch him doing the wiring, with these wonderful
long fingers. He was pleasant. Mostly I remember eating my dinner in the middle
of the night, because I left too early to eat dinner at home. I remember
everything was leftover from the day shift. I can distinctly remember the salad
was all limp and greasy. I don&#039;t remember what else we had to eat, but that
leftover salad with the dressing on it was pretty grim. I was so tired. I just
dragged myself home, and then I had an eight o&#039;clock class at the university, on
Wordsworth. Actually, it was taught by [Norman] Maclean, the guy who wrote A
River Runs Through It. That&#039;s a real funny story, because I was so tired. The
university was on a quarter system, so you only had three months for one class.
You&#039;d just get into it and then you had to start writing your paper. Your grade
depended on your paper. I was so tired I didn&#039;t have time to do much in the way
of extra reading. I was trying to keep house, too and everything. I remember my
question. The question was to discuss the symbolism in Wordsworth&#039;s poem about
Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802 or something, a poem about a bridge. I
don&#039;t know, do you remember what it is? I don&#039;t know.

FARRELL: No.

BEHRENS: Well, anyhow. I thought I had done a good job, but I failed. I went
into him. Oh, on my paper, it just said --my name was Harmon, at the time --it
said, &quot;Too much Harmon, not enough Wordsworth.&quot; That was all. The total comment.
I went in and I said, &quot;What do you mean? He said, &quot;Well, this symbolism is your
symbolism and not Wordsworth&#039;s.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, I&#039;m not Wordsworth, and neither
are you.&quot; I was a snippy thing, I guess. I said, &quot;Internally, within the poem,
the symbolism makes sense, and that&#039;s how I saw it. I haven&#039;t had a chance to
study Wordsworth&#039;s life, I haven&#039;t had a chance to read all of his other poems,
so I can&#039;t relate it to anything outside of the poem, so I&#039;ve only done the
symbolism within the poem.&quot; He changed my grade, which I thought was wonderful.
The funny thing is --the very funny thing is --that later, I married a professor
at the University of Chicago and we all lived in the same building.

FARRELL: What did he end up changing your grade to?

BEHRENS: I don&#039;t remember, but it was a good enough grade. Probably a B. But I
think he must&#039;ve been astonished, because he was so famous, such a great
teacher, for me to criticize his test. But it meant so much to me to go to the
University of Chicago. I loved it so much. I remember just leaping up in the air
after one class. I was having the kind of education I wanted. It was worth
everything to go there.

FARRELL: Do you remember what effect the war had on the campus culture?

BEHRENS: At Chicago?

FARRELL: Yeah.

BEHRENS: Well, there were a lot of sailors, I think. It was just sort of
subdued. I was involved with a magazine, The Chicago Maroon. Being married, I
didn&#039;t live in a dorm or I didn&#039;t partake of social activities very much, so I
don&#039;t know. I just remember there were a lot of people that were in the navy
there. I hate to sound like I was so outside of it, but I kind of was, working
in a factory and trying to keep house. I couldn&#039;t even go to the extra sessions.
I could go to the lectures, but I couldn&#039;t go to the group meetings for
anything. It was just hard. It was a hard time for me.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about maybe some of the things that
you experienced in the factory in Chicago? Were there other women that were
working in the factory?

BEHRENS: Oh, yeah. There were, because a lot of the able-bodied men were in the
service, so there were a lot of women. I remember there was a USO in Chicago,
and they had various affairs --contests and promotional things going on. And I
do remember V-J Day very clearly, in Grant Park. That&#039;s where everybody
collected, in Grant Park and along Michigan Boulevard. It was a riotous affair.
Everybody was so happy. There were sailors and all kinds of people, and
everybody was singing and shouting and drinking. It was such a relief from all
the tension. And all the worry, of course, and tragedies. My life as a student
during the war was sort of an isolating life. I&#039;d go into a classroom and I
remember when I first went to the university, I&#039;d have --. I don&#039;t remember
breakfast, but for lunch I&#039;d have a peanut butter sandwich, because that cheap
and protein. For dinner, I&#039;d have a sandwich that was with meat in it, and that
was it at first. That&#039;s all I could afford. So it was a time when the Depression
still hung heavy. And the university was an isolated world and my working was an
isolated world; and then I&#039;d go home to trying to keep my little apartment and
do the laundry. I didn&#039;t have a washing machine. I was kind of out of it, at the
same time I was in it. It&#039;s sort of hard to explain. Since I didn&#039;t have anybody
close to me in the service, my brother --. Well, that&#039;s an interesting thing. My
brother wanted to be a Conscientious Objector. I don&#039;t know where he got it
from. My father had been in the service in World War I, but he had been a
draftsman during World War I. He had belonged to the army, but because of his
technical background, he was sent working on Curtiss airplanes in Long Island.
But he was no Conscientious Objector at all, so my brother didn&#039;t get it from
him. But I think it was because he was given a BB gun one Christmas, and my
father took him out and had him shoot a bird. When he saw the bird drop at his
feet and realized he&#039;d killed it, he said, &quot;I&#039;ll never pick up a gun again as
long as I live.&quot; So he tried to be a Conscientious Objector, but he wasn&#039;t
accepted. He said, &quot;I&#039;ll be an ambulance driver, I&#039;ll work in an office, but I
will not pick up a gun.&quot; Well, you can&#039;t be in the service if you don&#039;t go
through basic training; you have to pick up a gun. He said, &quot;Well, I&#039;m sorry, I
can&#039;t.&quot; So they put him in the hospital for observation for two weeks. It was
right on Main Street, and he spent a lot of time looking out the window. He
didn&#039;t have anything to do; they just kept him in a room and interviewed him now
and then. He tells of one time they interviewed him and asked him if he ever
heard voices. He said, &quot;You mean the kind that sits on one shoulder, you hear it
in one ear, and then he pops over to the other shoulder and you hear it in that
ear and it tells you things to do and how to think?&quot; &quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; they said,
&quot;Yeah, yeah?&quot; He said, &quot;Nope, never heard them.&quot; So they decided he was not fit
for service for 4-F, psychological reasons. He carried that with him all his
life, and it really hurt him. But he went to a Lutheran church and the Lutheran
church did not oppose being a member of the service. He&#039;d never written any
papers of any kind, he&#039;d never joined any organization. He had nothing to prove
that he was a sincere [Conscientious Objector], just that he said he&#039;d never
pick up a gun, so they didn&#039;t credit that at all. So that&#039;s why my brother
wasn&#039;t in it.

My husband was 4-F. So kids I went to high school with, I kind of lost track of,
because I was off in Chicago. So it was a strange thing, to be part of it and
not part of it. I would see the newsreels and I would agonize over the
destruction. I remember seeing All Quiet on the Western Front when I was in high
school. On one Memorial Day, we had to write essays. I remember writing an essay
against war, that was very intense. I don&#039;t know what to say, how to think about
it. There was so much hoopla, so much marching and so much going on, so much
destruction. Having come from a German background, this was very hard, because
my father had spoken German before he spoke English. He went into my
grandmother, his mother, one day crying because the children wouldn&#039;t play with
him. They called him a dumb heine. He said, &quot;Someday I&#039;ll speak better English
than all the rest of them.&quot; And he did. He ended up with a magnificent
vocabulary and quite a prestigious job with the state. But for me, German was
songs and games, and I said my prayers in German. I couldn&#039;t speak German, but
we were taught these little childhood things. When my grandparents would all be
together, they&#039;d all speak German. My mother had heard German in her home and
took it in high school, so they could converse with their parents. But they
wouldn&#039;t speak German to us children. They taught us the little prayers and
things, and we ate German cooking and we knew quite a lot about German culture.
But I remember how awful it was for my grandparents. My grandfather Berns had
been a member of the Socialist Labor party, and they were all very
liberal-minded people. I remember how awful it was for them. They would see the
destruction of German cities and Germans, and knew that there were Germans who
were not Nazis. But even as recently as ten years ago, one of my friends, who
knew I had a German background, twice said to me in a conversation, &quot;Well, the
only good German is a dead German.&quot; Well, that was the way people felt during
the war. It was awful. Sometimes when people would say, with my name, &quot;Oh,
you&#039;re German, aren&#039;t you?&quot; &quot;No, I&#039;m Swedish. There was just a German married
into somebody.&quot; Because it was incomprehensible. We&#039;d know from the news and
from the newscasts. You&#039;d go to the movies, you&#039;d see Pathé news. But they were
all old; it wasn&#039;t at the moment. But you&#039;d see the bombers and you&#039;d see the
destruction. And having seen All Quiet on the Western Front, you knew it was
that and more, much more, larger scale. It was just hard to hold it all in, to
figure how it could be.

In fact, I&#039;ve been writing a story --in fact, it&#039;s a novella --about the way the
Germans felt about Hitler and about the protests. We know about the protests.
Protesters were people like those who tried to assassinate Hitler. We know about
the people who helped the Jews escape. We know about a lot of it. But the little
things that went on, the organizations, the efforts of the people who hated
Hitler and were appalled by it in Germany, you don&#039;t know too much about what
went on with them and what organizations --. My first art teacher was in
Buffalo, in the thirties. Margaret Hyne, her name was. She had been part of a
protest moment, and her husband. I think they put out papers or brochures or
something. I don&#039;t know exactly what they did, but there was a whole
organization. She had a newborn baby, and she and her husband and her parents,
and his parents, too, I guess --I don&#039;t know who all --were working somewhere
putting on the protest flyers. Whatever they were doing, I don&#039;t know. She went
home to nurse her baby, and she&#039;d only barely gotten home when somebody came in
and said, &quot;They&#039;ve found them and they&#039;ve killed them all. You&#039;ve got to get out
of here.&quot; She just grabbed up her baby with what she had, and through an
underground of some sort, she got to France. From France, she found sponsors in
America, because she was an artist. She had actually worked with Käthe
Kollwitz, who was a very famous German woman artist, who was banished by Hitler.
But anyhow, she was telling me about what it was like, and about the refugees
that managed to escape. But she was telling me about the anguish of people who
were so opposed to everything that Hitler had wrought. But you don&#039;t know much
about all those little stories like that, unless it happened to somebody famous.

FARRELL: Had you heard a lot of those sentiments or those stories during or
after the war?

BEHRENS: Did I hear about them during or after the war?

FARRELL: Yeah.

BEHRENS: Oh, during.

FARRELL: During.

BEHRENS: This was in &#039;38, I guess, that I knew Margaret Hyne and she was my
teacher. She had got out her guitar and sang German Lieder. It was so beautiful
and so sad. She was a fine artist. She told me about Käthe Kollwitz. I don&#039;t
know if you&#039;ve ever seen any of Käthe Kollwitz&#039;s work. She was a socialist. All
her work had to do with the poor. Her husband, too was a doctor in Berlin. They
lived in the poorest section of Berlin. From what I understood from Margaret
Hyne, if I&#039;m remembering correctly, she was banished to some mountain retreat.
And not allowed to have any of her stuff sold or distributed in any way. But
they couldn&#039;t kill her outright, because she was so popular, so well-known and
loved by forward-thinking people in Germany.

FARRELL: Did that affect your feelings towards working in a factory during the war?

BEHRENS: That&#039;s the curious thing. Because after all, I was an American, and we
had to win. The war effort was everywhere. It was everything you did. It was all
about the war. Even your rationing and --. You couldn&#039;t escape it. You were so
appalled at what was going on over there. We were so appalled at Hitler and
Nazism. I had Jewish friends, and their suffering --. And Margaret, her story.
You couldn&#039;t escape it; it was just everywhere. So working in a factory --that&#039;s
the part that&#039;s so awful --to help create engines of destruction, things that
were going to destroy other people and cities, whole cities. When I think of
Dresden, I just don&#039;t want to think. You didn&#039;t know. It wasn&#039;t instant like it
is now, instant news. You&#039;d get stuff later and it was something that had
happened. The immediacy of war in America must&#039;ve been quite different from the
immediacy of war in Europe. We didn&#039;t have bombings here. All we had was
rationing and work, and we had our Victory Gardens and we did without. There was
always the theme of sacrificing and doing without, and the war effort and
support the boys. You would dread hearing reports of losses. Of course, a big
assault --. I can&#039;t think of the name now. Not Omaha Beach. Well, you know. I
can&#039;t think of it.

FARRELL: Normandy Beach?

BEHRENS: I&#039;m trying to think of the name of the huge assault where they pulled
the boats up near the shore, in France. Just right at the moment, it escapes me.
But that was so shocking. And to see pictures later, movies later, of the boys
being gunned down in the water, it was just --. It&#039;s so hard to imagine --to
believe, even --what was going on. Being 3,000 miles away from it --. More than
that, because 3,000 miles across the Atlantic and then wherever we were here. I
don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t know what to say. It&#039;s just a time that is hard to contain.
But everybody felt like, we&#039;re all in this together, we&#039;ve got to do whatever we
can do. We do without, we donate things, we donate our time. You&#039;d work for the
USO, you worked in factories. It was chaotic.

FARRELL: Those feelings of working together and doing without, and those
feelings of patriotism and sacrifice, how long did that continue after the war ended?

BEHRENS: I don&#039;t know. I really don&#039;t know, because it was quite a time before
normalcy, shall we say, returned. I think it was just exhaustion, as much as
anything, relief it was over. Then the gradual unfolding of the leftovers of war
and the Holocaust, and the information that kept coming out, and Anne Frank and
all. There was just a generalized feeling --for me, at least, as far as I knew
and everybody I knew --was revulsion and exhaustion, and glad it was over. But
you knew it wasn&#039;t over. There still had to be healing and there had to be
reconstruction. It was just a terrible time, all the way around.

FARRELL: Do you remember how that healing and reconstruction played out, or how
that unfolded? Do you remember what that healing and reconstruction was like?

BEHRENS: Well, not really, because my own persona life was so chaotic at the
time. I was divorced and living alone in Chicago. All the people I had gone to
school with were gone, back to their hometowns or whatever, and I was living in
a basement apartment all alone. It was a bachelor&#039;s degree and I was back to
square one. I couldn&#039;t type and take shorthand, and I didn&#039;t want to work in a
factory, and the factory jobs closed down, of course. Then when I remarried,
that was during the fifties, the crazy time where we all wore little aprons and
had the cocktails all ready for our husbands when they came home, and raising
children, which came so close after the end of the war, and trying to make a
different life for them. I guess everybody missed Roosevelt, too. Things were
very unsettled, in lots of ways. But also there was getting the men back into
the jobs, getting the women out of the workforce. One of the things I remember
most about that period were his-and-her towels in the bathrooms. Everything was
geared toward domesticity, toward having lots of children and buying houses and
trying to return to normalcy. Normalcy meant the status quo, as it had been. But
not as it had been during the Depression, in terms of money, but in terms of
role playing. All the women where I lived, we all lived the same kind of life.
Everything revolved around our husbands&#039; careers and raising children and
reading women&#039;s magazines. I can remember sharing recipes, how to make meatloaf
in a different way. It was sort of like everybody just wanted to get back to the
good old days, but the new days, because there were --. Danish modern furniture
came in at that time. Everybody was trying to fix their houses with Danish
modern furniture and spun aluminum candlesticks and split-level houses. There
was just a preoccupation with --. I really can&#039;t say return to normalcy, because
that wouldn&#039;t be right. It was to have the good life. As a matter of fact, I
went to Germany in 1970-something. I met different people, who really thought
that their image of America was that everybody was rich and had two cars and
everybody owned their own home. That was the image that we lived with, and I
guess people in other parts of the world had of us, too. It&#039;s hard to go back
and remember how you were and things were. After all, that&#039;s half a century ago
for me.

FARRELL: Do you remember how long you stayed working in the factory, after the
war ended?

BEHRENS: No, not very long, because --. No, I don&#039;t think so. I don&#039;t remember
exactly when I quit. But they didn&#039;t need so many people. I guess I was getting
near my degree, and my marriage broke up, so that&#039;s sort of a vague time for me.
I don&#039;t remember.

FARRELL: What did you do for work after the factory? Or was there a period where
you weren&#039;t working?

BEHRENS: I had the damnedest job. I worked as a department store specialist for
Lee and Brewer. That&#039;s all I remember, their name, but what the name of their
company was --. It had to do with promoting stuff in department stores. My
special area was the Cordite Company. They made plastic clothes lines, which was
something brand new, and plastic clothes pins that were little, instead of the
great big wooden ones. They&#039;re little plastic [ones]. Plastics were really
coming in then, in great abundance. I remember these colorful plastic clothes
pins. My job was to see to it that demonstrations were set up in different
department stores. I&#039;d hire the women who would have their spiel, and I&#039;d tell
them what they had to say, and check on the inventory and the ads and all that.
Had nothing to do with my education or my interests or anything, but it was a
job and it was something I could do, because I didn&#039;t have to type or take shorthand.

FARRELL: Do you remember when the men were coming back from overseas, and how it
sort of unfolded that they were getting their jobs back and the women who were
working weren&#039;t anymore?

BEHRENS: I don&#039;t remember too much about that because I was in a university
community. My husband was a professor there, and it was kind of a little closed
scene down there, in the south part of Chicago. I remember racial tensions in
the area where I lived, in Hyde Park. On the north side of Hyde Park were the
Devil&#039;s Disciples, I think; and the south side of Hyde Park were the Blackstone
Rangers. Or just vice versa, I&#039;m not sure. The university was a little enclave
in the middle, and these communities, these gangs --. In fact, it was so bad
that everybody on my street had a dog or a gun. My daughter was treed once, on
the way home from school. She had to climb a tree to get away. Nobody rode their
bikes around because they were afraid that somebody with a chain was going to
threaten to whip them in the face and take their bikes away from them. This was
the time when Saul Alinsky was working in South Chicago. It was a hard time,
because people in the university understood the tensions of social problems, and
were not prejudiced; but they had to watch out for themselves anyhow. You&#039;d go
to meetings with Saul Alinsky and hear him speak, and try to do the right thing.
But it was sort of more turned inward, at the time, I would say, for me, because
as I say, I had four children and I was in a suburban kind of a life. Doris Day
could&#039;ve been my middle name.

FARRELL: Do you remember, after the war ended, how the cultural landscape of
Chicago changed at all?

BEHRENS: The culture of Chicago?

FARRELL: Yeah, how that changed after the war ended, if it did at all.

BEHRENS: Well, gradually, Navy Pier was not as active as it had been and you
didn&#039;t see the servicemen on the streets anymore. It was all sort of like trying
to turn back. The politics of Chicago itself became sort of prominent in
people&#039;s minds. I just remember I was at the convention in Chicago where
Roosevelt was nominated for his fourth term. I got to go to the convention,
because I was with The Chicago Maroon, the university paper, as the art editor.
I took my pad and I did caricatures of all the different people. I sat right on
the floor, with all the delegates. I&#039;ve still got some of those pictures that I
drew. I don&#039;t know who they were now. But I&#039;d draw a picture of one delegate,
&quot;Oh, oh, do this one. Do him.&quot; So I&#039;d go on and draw somebody else. But I wasn&#039;t
that involved with President Roosevelt at the time; I was more involved with
drawing pictures. I don&#039;t mean to sound empty-headed, but at different times in
your life, and different age and different situations, your social conscience,
it just takes different turns and different shapes. I remember being appalled by
racial problems. I remember feeling outside of it, in some way. I remember going
to a black nightclub in South Chicago to hear Billie Holiday sing. That was so
thrilling. We were the only white couple there. We didn&#039;t think to be afraid and
nobody bothered us. It was very strange, very strange, to be so uninvolved, in a
way, but right in the thick of it. I guess it&#039;s just sort of like, I knew what I
believed and my husband believed, and we tried to vote and be part of what we
believed in, and all this stuff is going on around. I&#039;m sorry I can&#039;t be more
helpful in some way.

FARRELL: No, this is fantastic. How did your life, either maybe mentally or
structurally, change after the war? Did it change at all permanently or temporarily?

BEHRENS: How did it change? Well, just a minute; I&#039;ve got to have a little sip here.

FARRELL: Sure.

BEHRENS: Well, I told you after the war, within five years, I was married and
started raising a family. Between the time when I got my degree and got married
again, I was just sort of surviving. I don&#039;t remember too much about that time.
No, that&#039;s sort of blanked out, because I was all alone in this basement
apartment. My sister came and lived with me for a year, but we didn&#039;t get along
because she was a voice major. She was studying voice with Vittorio Trevisan,
who had been a bass singer with the Italian opera, La Scala. We had this little
apartment. It was just [a] one room apartment with a kitchen. I had a piano in
the kitchen and she would practice. Her voice was so big and so loud, and I
couldn&#039;t study. She had the right to practice and sing loud; I had the right to
not be disturbed while I was trying to [study]. So that was only that one year.
I don&#039;t remember too much about that time. It was sort of a dead time. I&#039;m sorry.

FARRELL: No. how do you feel America changed after World War II?

BEHRENS: Well, it was incredible. As I say, the whole thing was to retool, to
get back to making goods to sell to people, to have babies. That was a big
thing, have babies. Then there was a big market for baby furniture. That&#039;s when
they started with all the formulas, bottles and formulas, and women&#039;s magazines.
And movies, too. It was all to try to reestablish a good life in America. Two
cars in every garage, and lots of babies and lots of furniture. I don&#039;t remember
much, except that everything was turned inward, into your split-level houses and
your barbecues in the backyard, and retooling for consumer goods. Actually, I
think we lost a lot of sort of a moral compass, in a way, became too
consumer-oriented. I may be wrong about that, because I&#039;m not a social sciences
or a political science major; but that&#039;s my feeling, that there was a
stereotypical of sense of what an American good life was.

FARRELL: Is there anything else that you maybe wanted to add about this period?

BEHRENS: Probably lots of stuff I&#039;ll think about. I could go on and on, but I
can&#039;t think of anything right now. Because I don&#039;t know how much my experience
reflects the experience in general and how much was my own turned-inward kind of
world of trying to survive and go to school. And my private life was kind of a
shambles. So I don&#039;t know who I speak for, except for myself. I would like to
have more political wisdom. But I remember working on every Democratic
presidential campaign. I remember even wheeling my babies in the baby carriage,
and the carriage was full of literature that I would take to different houses
and try to talk up. I remember working for [Eugene] McCarthy and [George]
McGovern and I don&#039;t know who else right now --all the Democratic candidates
--and being heartbroken when they didn&#039;t win. And licking envelopes and --. I
always tried to do what I could, on my little personal level. But it wasn&#039;t
until later --. But during that period, from President Roosevelt on up to --oh,
let&#039;s see; I don&#039;t know, I guess up until now --I&#039;ve always worked, but just at
the local level. So I wish I could tell you more that would be helpful, but --.

FARRELL: No, this has been fantastic.

BEHRENS: But I would like to find that picture and those early tracings, because
they&#039;re such a part of that time.

FARRELL: Yeah, yeah. Well, this is a good place to leave it here for today, so
thank you.

BEHRENS: Okay.
