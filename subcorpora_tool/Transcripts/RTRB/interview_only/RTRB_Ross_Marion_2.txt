REDMAN: All right. My name is Sam Redman, and I’m here today again with
Marion Ross. It’s our second session today, on July 12, 2011, and today
we’ll be starting with the Second World War, and following that, we’ll talk
about some time you spent on the campus of the University of California, and
specifically, your involvement with the International House, I’d like ask about.

ROSS: Yes. What happened to the shipyard experience? I thought that’s what it
was all about.

REDMAN: Yes, let’s get into that. Let’s spend the majority of today talking
about that. So I’d like to begin, then, situating us in time at the very start
of the war, what your recollections were about Pearl Harbor.

ROSS: Now, am I to look at the camera or look at you?

REDMAN: You’re to look at me, if that’s all right.

ROSS: Oh, sure, All right. It was Sunday, December 7. I first heard about the
bombing of Pearl Harbor when I was walking back to my hall, after chapel. There
were these girls screaming down the corridors. We had a great many Hawaiian
residents in Olney; that was their hall. So we had about twenty, divided over
the four years. We also had a number of Japanese Americans and a couple of
Japanese students from Japan. Now, the thing is, I can’t remember; I think
they lived in Mills Hall. They did not live in Olney. At any rate, so everyone
was excited. The girls were trying to get in touch with their parents. They
nearly all lived in Honolulu. Cissy lived in Paia, which is on Maui, and another
girl lived on the island of Hawaii, but the others were all Honolulu students.
Nobody knew anything, and so it was a very frantic time. Our head resident --
Dear me, the whole idea of a chaperone now is so long gone. Mrs. Judd had been
the governor’s lady of Hawaii for many years, and she was divorced, but she
still had lots of friends in Honolulu. I can’t remember the rest of the day.

REDMAN: Do you have a sense of how so many students from Hawaii or from Japan,
or Japanese American students had ended up at Mills in particular? Do you think
it was sort of a coincidence, or was there a reason for that?

ROSS: Oh, well, no, Mr. and Mrs. Mills had been missionaries. They were mostly
in what is now Sri Lanka, but they had had a stint in Hawaii, and I think that
was probably the origin. Also it was a time of women’s colleges flourishing,
and Mills was closest to Hawaii. I think that also had a bearing. Then, once you
get a group coming from a particular area, then they have friends and
enrollments build on that. Because we had a strong contingent from New Trier
Township High School, outside of Chicago, and another contingent from Oklahoma.
This happens. At any rate, I remember we usually had assemblies on Wednesday
afternoon; but we had a special college meeting on the Monday, and President
Reinhardt gave a wonderful address. What I remember her saying to us is that
Japan is the enemy of the United States, but the Japanese people are not my
enemy or yours. That made a lasting impression on me, about the distinction
between people who were our friends and their government.

REDMAN: It’s a very powerful statement.

ROSS: Oh, yes, it was. Well, she was a powerful woman. And she believed it, and
you knew that.

REDMAN: It’s a really interesting statement, as well because it seems, just in
terms of what I’ve read about the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbor, it
sounds as though that was something that needed to be said, as well.

ROSS: Oh, yes!

REDMAN: Can you maybe elaborate for me why someone would be moved to make that
very powerful statement at that time?

ROSS: Well, I don’t know if I told you that I’d gone to elementary school
with a great many Japanese children. I don’t remember any prejudice about them
in that period in my life. But I had seen some of it when I went to high school
downtown. Did I tell you that all the Japanese people -- except for the farmers,
who provided the children that came to my school -- that the Japanese in San
Pedro were all living on Terminal Island.

REDMAN: Yes, yeah.

ROSS: And the Navy took that over. So I think that I became aware that there was
prejudice. I may have told you that in my high school, there was one Negro girl,
and there were no -- and we called them Negroes then -- workforce in San Pedro
at all. So I don’t know why I became aware. I don’t know. But I was aware
that there was prejudice. My parents admired the work ethic of the Japanese,
which was evident to them and to us. Us, meaning my sister and me. So when you
say about the need, well, President Reinhardt was very, very smart. She was, in
my view, very old then; she was sixty-plus. So, she had experienced a lot in her
life. So I can’t really explain, except in retrospect, it was necessary, and
I’m grateful to her for being so able to express it so beautifully. Then as I
told you -- she must’ve persuaded the faculty to do this, but -- [she] did
grant the seniors degrees in absentia. The executive order, which removed the
Japanese beyond the Rockies, restricted them to beyond the Rockies, was very
traumatic for them and traumatic for the people that missed them.

REDMAN: Now, it’s interesting, because so many people that I have interviewed
have talked about their communities in California as being somewhat separated
from the Japanese community in California. They often express feelings as though
the Japanese community maybe self-isolated or they were isolated for one reason
or another. Now, as a student, I would assume that you’re living in a dorm, on
the same floor with many Japanese students, and you’re interacting with them,
you’re learning with them, you’re perhaps studying with them. It seems more
traumatic, in some sense, to --

ROSS: They did not live in my hall.

REDMAN: Okay.

ROSS: I’m trying to think of the class which -- No, May was the only girl I
really knew. She was a Japanese American.

REDMAN: She was taken to a camp, is that correct.

ROSS: Yes. Yes.

REDMAN: So when that happened, some people seem to have had conflicted feelings
about that.

ROSS: Oh, I didn’t.

REDMAN: You didn’t.

ROSS: I thought it was wrong.

REDMAN: Yeah. It’s very clear to you at that time, that --

ROSS: Yes. No, I should tell you that in San Pedro, there were two men who were
rounded up the day or two after Pearl Harbor. One of them committed suicide in
the hospital, and I don’t know what happened to the other one. But otherwise,
they were Americans. I may have told you that this wonderful man worked for
Daddy. Did I tell you that?

REDMAN: Yes.

ROSS: Yeah, Frank Inouye. Well, he was born in Hawaii, but he wanted to be an
American, and he was an American. His brother-in-law served in the U.S. Army.
But no, in March, he was carted off.

REDMAN: So there seemed immediately to be a tension there for you between, to
state it baldly, the democratic ideals and freedoms of the United States and the
treatment of the Japanese.

ROSS: Yes. Yes. Well, I don’t know. This order [Executive Order 9066] was
signed by Franklin Roosevelt. One of my historian friends made an error, one of
the few errors he ever made, by telling me that it was an order put out by
General -- I think his name was DeWitt -- who was in charge of the whole western
United States. No, it was right straight from President Roosevelt. I can only
think there was such confusion in Washington, and I think it’s human nature to
want to blame somebody. So who do you have to pin the tail on the donkey?

REDMAN: Is it your sense that that confused a lot of progressives, even at the
time, in terms of maybe the faculty members at Mills or at Berkeley. It seems as
though when I talk to people who were ardent supporters of Franklin Roosevelt
all along, and even continuing on through the war, a lot of people were either
quietly frustrated by that decision or very upset by it.

ROSS: Well, I honestly thing that it receded from most of our minds, except for
the one or two people that I was in touch with. There was so much else going on.
There was a strong, strong view about keeping America out of the war. And this
was a shock. I don’t think we’d ever had foreign troops -- maybe Mexico at
some time; I’m a little hazy on my history there. So it was a great shock. I
think a lot of people just thought, well, this is a terrible price to pay, but
we’re going to pay l</transcript><transcript_alt></transcript_alt><rights></rights><fmt></fmt><usage></usage><userestrict>0</userestrict><xmllocation></xmllocation><xmlfilename></xmlfilename><collection_link></collection_link><series_link></series_link></record></ROOT>
