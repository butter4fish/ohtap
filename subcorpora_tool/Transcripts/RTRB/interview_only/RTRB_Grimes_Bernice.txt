DUNHAM: Today is April 29, 2014, and I’m here in the lovely home of Bernice
Grimes, who’s a narrator today for our Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home
Front oral history project. My name is David Dunham. This is interview one, tape
one. Bernice, we usually start in the beginning, so could you just tell me your
full name?

GRIMES: Bernice June Landis Grimes. Landis is what people back in the 1940s knew
me by.

DUNHAM: When and where were you born?

GRIMES: I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, May 16, 1928.

DUNHAM: Got a birthday coming up.

GRIMES: Yeah.

DUNHAM: Can you tell me a little bit about your family background, your parents,
if you knew your grandparents?

GRIMES: Well, my grandmother had thirteen kids. I did know her. I never met my
grandfather on my blood father’s side, except an aunt. I never met any of my
grandfathers. My mother was a showgirl in the twenties. She started at sixteen
years old. After I was born, she decided she needed a home for me. Of course, my
father didn’t want a home; he was a professional gambler, so he was on the
road all the time. So she married my stepfather in 1933.

DUNHAM: Can I ask for a minute, as a showgirl, what did that mean in the twenties?

GRIMES: Oh, I can’t remember the outfit that she was with, but it was like
burlesque. But it was a step above that. I have a big picture in there I can
show you of her. A big marquee one.

DUNHAM: I would love to see that. As a gambler, too, what did that mean for your father?

GRIMES: Oh, cards. He was a professional card player, for money, during the
Prohibition Era.

DUNHAM: Poker?

GRIMES: Yes. And he was always running from the cops, my mother said.
Prohibition days. So then in 1933, my mother retired from show business. She was
twenty years older than me, so she was born in 1908. So then we moved to a
little village called Okauchee, in Wisconsin.

DUNHAM: Now, I’ve seen Okauchee Lake. Is that -- ?

GRIMES: That’s it. Yeah, it was Jakels Resort, Okauchee Lake, in Wakausha
County, thirty miles north of Milwaukee.

DUNHAM: I notice in your bio that it said you have American Indian ancestry.

GRIMES: Yeah. My grandmother’s -- I couldn’t find out, because I’ve always
heard that we’re part Indian. When I asked Mother, she said, “Yeah, Cherokee
and Sioux.” But no further. For some reason, back in those days, it was like
being a colored person. They weren’t even allowed in the bars, where I was from.

DUNHAM: So you didn’t disclose it.

GRIMES: Dogs could go in, but no Indians. True story. So then I asked my aunt,
and she said, “Well, we’re gypsy.” And I asked my uncle, and he said,
“You’re a mixture between a jackass and a wheelbarrow.” That’s the
stories I got. So I finally wrote my grandmother. It was after I had my kids.
Then she wrote me a brief letter, and she tells, “Yeah, on both sides.” But
she never told us what tribes we’re from. But yeah, it’s all through our
family. So we’ve been trying to do the genealogy, trying to find out
something; but without an exact tribe it’s tough. So we are part Cherokee, and
we are part Sioux.

DUNHAM: So your mother remarried your stepfather in -- was that ’33?

GRIMES: 1933.

DUNHAM: That’s when you moved to -- ?

GRIMES: Okauchee.

DUNHAM: What was life like in Okauchee?

GRIMES: Oh, country. Nothing. They finally found a garage to live in. There was
no floor, no heat. I remember Mother -- I was five years old, because I was
boarded out while she worked, with an elderly lady, until I was five years old.
So she would hang blankets around. I still have the little kerosene stove she
used to keep us warm. That’s the way we lived for a long time. It was during
Depression days.

DUNHAM: So how did your family survive?

GRIMES: Well, my mother fished. My dad was always a salesman, my stepdad, and he
worked for the {Ballston?} store in Milwaukee. He drove thirty miles, would be
sixty miles back and forth, every day, and at one point was lost in a snowstorm
for three days. They would save twenty-five cents a week and buy a piece of
board to try to put in the house. The neighbors sold them the garage, and all
the neighbors got together and put it on a great big wooden type of sled and
pulled it up the driveway. My parents had put some money down on a plot on a
hill, and they built a platform and put it up on the hill and started building
from there. No water, no electricity, nothing.

DUNHAM: The winters must’ve been really hard.

GRIMES: Oh, yeah. Very cold.

DUNHAM: What kind of heating did you have?

GRIMES: Well, we just had the kerosene for a while. Then after they built the
house, we had oil heat. Some kind of oil that they bought, and a stove. Some of
them still had the old coal stoves and stuff, but we didn’t have that.

DUNHAM: Was there a school there?

GRIMES: Yeah, it was Okauchee School. Someplace, I still have my graduation picture.

DUNHAM: What was school like in Okauchee?

GRIMES: Well, there were three rooms. It was first, second, third grade in one
room, with one teacher; and fourth, fifth, and sixth in the other room with a
teacher; and seventh and eighth, the principal had. So a country-type school.

DUNHAM: What was a typical day like for your mother, then, after you moved to Okauchee?

GRIMES: She was very lonely, because she’d had a very active life, a very
active life. So she put a garden in. She’d have a garden in the summertime,
and raise chickens. I would go around to the rich people that came out on the
lake for the summertime and take chicken orders and vegetable orders, and I’d
do a little hula for them while I was there.

DUNHAM: Oh, you did? So you were a performer too.

GRIMES: Yeah, yeah. That’s what she did in the summertime. And then she
fished. We ate a lot of fish. And she worked in the resort, in the cabins that
they had. I think I have a letter someplace; I think she made like twenty-five
cents a week turning mattresses and stuff.

DUNHAM: What was a typical day for you like, as a child, then?

GRIMES: Play. I had a canoe. Summertime, I could go out in the canoe, and fish
or swim. She taught me to swim immediately. I was a very good swimmer.

DUNHAM: Did you have siblings?

GRIMES: No. No. She raised my cousin for a while. He didn’t have anyplace to
live, so he was with us off and on, and then the sisters would take turns with
him. But outside of that, no; just me.

DUNHAM: Was your cousin younger or older then?

GRIMES: No, I was two days older.

DUNHAM: Oh, very close in age.

GRIMES: Yeah, and his mother was a showgirl, too.

DUNHAM: Were there any community organizations or churches there or anything
that you did?

GRIMES: They had several churches, but my folks didn’t go to them. Well, we
had a monastery in Okauchee, and I used to go down and visit with the monks all
the time.

DUNHAM: What was that like?

GRIMES: Well, I don’t know, I just enjoyed it. I wasn’t raised Christian or
anything, but I just really enjoyed them. Then we had an Episcopal church there
that I used to go to. And then kind of a walk, which is four miles away from me,
we had a Lutheran church, and then a Catholic church. They had churches. Once in
a while, if the neighbors went, I would go. But a lot of times I would just walk
the mile and go up to the Episcopal church.

DUNHAM: Well, so you stayed in Okauchee until ’42?

GRIMES: Yeah.

DUNHAM: Do you remember when you first heard about the attack on Pearl Harbor?

GRIMES: I really don’t remember that much about it.

DUNHAM: Yeah, you were pretty young, yeah.

GRIMES: Because I was thinking, I don’t know whether it was kept from me or
what. But we were living in Rockford then; my dad had gotten a good job. Every
weekend, we drove back to Wisconsin, to stay at the house. But he was a
representative for Thor Manufacturers. I still have his pictures from there.

DUNHAM: Oh, yeah, I’ve seen the photo.

GRIMES: Yeah, pictures from the newspapers and stuff that I have.

DUNHAM: So what did he do for them? He was a salesman?

GRIMES: Well, uh-huh. He’d go out to homes and -- I have the pictures here,
demonstrating. Then my mother went to work there, too. They worked for Progress
Electric Shop, on State Street, in Rockford. That’s where he started making
some decent money. So we stayed there until the war came. Of course, then
everything was going into the materials for the military.

DUNHAM: Yeah. How did Rockford change, once the war started?

GRIMES: I don’t know, because we left. We went back. We went right back to Okauchee.

DUNHAM: Had Okauchee changed much? Or as a small town it was -- ?

GRIMES: No. No, it hadn’t changed. No. There was just nothing there. I took a
trip back there in, I guess it was the early fifties, and there wasn’t too
much change. They did have a different school, but the old houses were still
there, and the lake was all weeded up.

DUNHAM: Well, before we head to California, is there anything else about
Okauchee you’d like to share, in what was going on there?

GRIMES: Well, it was just a very simple life. Very simple life, and a sheltered
life. So when I came to California, it was a, wow!

CARLYLE: She used to ice fish, didn’t she?

GRIMES: My mother ice fished, yeah.

DUNHAM: Did you learn to ice fish?

GRIMES: I fished, but I didn’t ice fish. She didn’t let me go out on the ice.

DUNHAM: Yeah, was that pretty treacherous?

GRIMES: Well, yeah, because if you didn’t watch what you were doing and it
started melting -- we lost a few people there. And she’d stay till the very
last minute.

DUNHAM: Did she ever have any close calls with that?

GRIMES: No. No, we got her out. Well, the last time, we had to go get her out,
because it was melting so fast. But no, not really a close call.

DUNHAM: So what was that like, when you had to get her out, though?

GRIMES: Oh, kind of scary. “Oh, why don’t you come on?” But she just loved
to fish. The whole family did.

DUNHAM: How did you hear about, your family hear about, California?

GRIMES: My aunt -- well, my mother had two sisters. After she got into show
business, she brought in the other sisters. The one, after Mother retired, then
somehow she ended up in Sacramento. I don’t know how she ended up here, but
she started a nightclub in San Pablo, called Club Thunderbird. She was going to
open up a steakhouse, because during the war everything went night and day, and
things were booming. She needed some help, so she asked my mother if she would
come and help her open the steakhouse. So they came out to do that. Of course,
in the meantime, the weather was so nice here. Of course, my dad, having to
drive in those -- get out and shovel the show every day, and try to -- it was
horrible. He loved the weather here. Then they heard about the shipyards, so he
got a job out at the shipyards as an electrician. They liked the weather, and
they just never went back. They just called their friend that sold houses and
sold the house, and that was it.

DUNHAM: Did you originally move right out to Walnut Creek?

GRIMES: No, we stayed there. My cousin and I -- he was with us -- he and I
stayed in the nightclub, upstairs; and my mother and dad had a little tiny
mobile -- I don’t know, they weren’t even mobiles in those days. They stayed
in that, and then they rented a house over on Standard Avenue for a while.

DUNHAM: What was it like living in the nightclub?

GRIMES: Oh, [laughs] you’d hear that jukebox going all night long. Of course,
in those days -- Ginger didn’t have slot machines, but they were all over in
the area. It was a rough and tough area.

DUNHAM: Yeah, so slot machines were legal anywhere?

GRIMES: They were. And I read an article not so long ago, they said that they
weren’t legal -- it was like ’44 and ’45 -- but I know they were, because
my kids’ father worked in a restaurant in Rodeo, and we had slot machines
there, and that was 1945. Mrs. Pechart was the wife of the big gangster [Walter
“Big Bill”] Pechart that ran everything in Contra Costa County. She used to
tell me, “You don’t play those slot machines, Bernice.” They were only
nickel ones. “Because,” she said, “you’re never going to win.” So
yeah, they were. But Ginger didn’t have them. She had a poker room. She had
one of the gangsters in the poker room, and I used to get in the kitchen at the
steakhouse, and climb upstairs and watch them gamble. They’d catch me, and
they’d get so mad at me.

DUNHAM: Were there fights and things coming out of that?

GRIMES: No, she didn’t have any fights there with that, no. But across the
street there was a bar. I forgot the name of it, but they were always having fights.

DUNHAM: What street? On San Pablo, is this?

GRIMES: Right on San Pablo Avenue. It’s no longer there.

DUNHAM: Do you know what the nearest cross street was or would have been?

GRIMES: It’s changed so much, when I go back over there, I couldn’t even
tell you.

DUNHAM: So you were living upstairs there for a while, and then you said you got
a -- ?

GRIMES: Then they found a house on Standard Avenue, which we stayed in until
they came out here.

DUNHAM: This is all within ’42 or into ’43?

GRIMES: Well, it’s ’42. I think it was early ’43 when we got started
purchasing the house out here. So we came out here in, I think it was the fall
of ’43. I can’t remember exactly.

DUNHAM: Right on this property here on -- ?

GRIMES: Yeah.

DUNHAM: Was it called Main Street at the [time]?

GRIMES: No, it was called Danville Boulevard. Route 1, Box 27 was our address.

DUNHAM: Do you know what the property was originally purchased for?

GRIMES: $6,000. We had two and a half acres.

DUNHAM: Was there a home?

GRIMES: Yeah, there was a beautiful -- and I’ll show you that eventually --
big stone house that we have never been able to find out who build it. All
stone. I was told it was from Mount Diablo. It had a huge cathedral fireplace in
the basement, with all wood floors, and it had a fireplace upstairs. The heat
was some sort of gas jets that you had to light with a match. Gorgeous,
gorgeous. There were some little things on the wall that we heard at one time;
it could’ve been a gambling house. Then of course, with the war, there
weren’t any places to live, and we had Port Chicago quite close to here. My
parents divided up and made four apartments in that stone house, plus the
downstairs, and rented them to service people and people that could afford.

DUNHAM: And then they were commuting to Port Chicago?

GRIMES: Yeah.

DUNHAM: It was Navy folks and their families?

GRIMES: Yeah. Well, if they had their families with them. Sometimes it was just
the sailors and their buddies. Actually, we had one that I knew, {Sutherlands?},
that he did bring his wife from New York, and they stayed with us for years.
Then we had another house, a little tiny cottage on the side. Then my dad built
a house by himself, with the bricks and stuff. Made the bricks and built a
little house. Then the little red house -- the second one when you came in --
was a garage up front, and they made that into an apartment and rented that out.
Then when the freeway come through, we moved that one back to where it is now.

DUNHAM: When did they put the freeway in?

GRIMES: Oh, God. Was it late fifties?

DUNHAM: I’m not sure.

GRIMES: I’d have to go back and look at the dates again.

HANSON: They bulldozed this townhouse down. The freeway lays over it.

DUNHAM: Oh, wow, so it was --

GRIMES: Yeah, just took a bulldozer, pfft. We had a well with a big tank up there.

DUNHAM: What was Walnut Creek like in ’43?

GRIMES: Well, it was really just the main street. Like I said, we had a
constable and a -- I forgot the other one already.

DUNHAM: What did you say? It was before we started recording. A constable and a
-- ?

GRIMES: Night watchman. Night watchman and a constable.

DUNHAM: Did they see much activity?

GRIMES: Oh, just kids. They’d drag the main on the weekends and switch drivers
so the cops wouldn’t know who it was. Of course, they always knew, because
everybody knew everybody. We knew everybody in town. It was a nice little town.
Nice little town. I’ve hated to see it change like it has.

DUNHAM: Well, growth can be hard.

GRIMES: Oh, yeah, too much. Too much, yeah.

DUNHAM: You’ve seen a lot.

GRIMES: Yeah.

DUNHAM: What were you doing then? You were fifteen, when you first got into
town, and then here in Walnut Creek.

GRIMES: Oh, I did everything. I worked some of the restaurants, I worked out in
the fields, I ran the hullers for across the street when he had a big walnut
orchard. We had walnut trees here that paid for our taxes. I still have the
walnut pole that I knock the walnuts. Just worked out in the fields. Then I
worked for {Dick Lamelle?}, who had a big creamery. I don’t know if you
remember him or not.

DUNHAM: No, I don’t know.

GRIMES: It’s where the bus depot was in later years. But he had a creamery
there, and I worked for him off and on.

DUNHAM: What did you do there?

GRIMES: Served. He made the ice cream, though, himself, and I helped him as a
waitress and a cashier, whatever. In those days, one person did it all. Then my
mother was very patriotic. Both of her brothers were in the service, and all of
her life, she’s been very patriotic. So she got a job at the shipyards, as a
Coast Guard Police. They’re the ones that manned the gates and did all the
investigating through the whole shipyards. When I took her picture down to the
museum there, they didn’t even know about them.

DUNHAM: Yeah. So what type of investigations would she be -- ?

GRIMES: Well, they were just like the cops there. It was their job. It was
through the Richmond Police Department.

DUNHAM: And I’ve heard given twenty-four hour and all these different people
coming together, that there was a fair amount of stuff going on.

GRIMES: Oh, yeah.

DUNHAM: So I’m just curious. Did she have stories of what she was having to
deal with?

GRIMES: She never said much to me. But that was her job. So when she got out
there, then she got her sister, who had been a showgirl but got married, and her
and her husband were welders out in Shipyard Number Two. So Mother talked Aunt
Scottie into going out, and she ended up being a Coast Guard Police. That’s
how I met my first husband. He was an ex-Marine, and he was Coast Guard Police
out there.

DUNHAM: How exactly did you guys meet?

GRIMES: Well, my mother had met him, and she introduced us.

DUNHAM: You’re still pretty young at the time.

GRIMES: Yeah, yeah.

DUNHAM: But mature.

GRIMES: Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. Just a kid. Yeah, and everything
went twenty-four hours a day.

DUNHAM: When did you begin working at the shipyards? How did that come about?

GRIMES: Well, Mother just decided that I should be doing something for the
government, too, and for our service people. That’s when she took me down,
helped me lie about my age, and we got in.

DUNHAM: Tell us about that, exactly. Did anybody question -- ?

GRIMES: I don’t remember too much about it. They never really asked a lot of
questions. But I looked pretty mature for my age, and, yeah, went to the union
and got right in.

DUNHAM: You started as a scaler, is that correct?

GRIMES: Yeah.

DUNHAM: So what did that mean? Do you remember your first day on the job?

GRIMES: Oh, yeah. I do. Not a lot of training. Hundred-pound air pressure gun.
Has a big hose that’s fastened on the wall, with air, and has a big chisel on
the end of it. I have a picture of somebody that had been one there. So they
told me very little. I’m supposed to go behind the welders. They weld, and
I’m supposed to use this chisel air gun and chisel the slag away. And not get
too close to the welders, because of the flash. Always wore my glasses and not
because of the burns, welder burns. So I’m looking at this. I put the chisel
in, the pig chisel, and I’m looking down at it, and I push the lever, and the
thing popped up and cut me right in the face. So first day, right away, my
mother went, “Oh, my God!” But that’s how I learned to do it, and that’s
how I did it. Then I got too close. I never got a flash, but I did get a welder
burn. I learned to stay away from them.

DUNHAM: When you got that first chisel to the face, was there a treatment?

GRIMES: It was just like a slight cut.

DUNHAM: So did you get some type of treatment for it?

GRIMES: Yeah, I went to first aid. They had first aid there.

DUNHAM: Then were you off the rest of that day, or you’re right back to work?

GRIMES: No. No.

DUNHAM: Then another time, you got burned, later on?

GRIMES: Yeah. They have some ointment or something they put on you.

DUNHAM: What was that like? How did you get burned, exactly?

GRIMES: Oh, that hurts. That stuff hurts. I got too close to them with their
torches. You had to stay a certain distance away. You get to working, and you
forget. First thing you know you’re right behind them. You can’t do that.

DUNHAM: In your bio, you wrote about the uniform you wore, and then also
something you did especially with makeup, relative to -- ?

GRIMES: We wore, yeah, a lot of pancake makeup, to protect our skin. A lot of
it, really heavy. Because you’re out in the elements anyway, but with that
heat from those welders all the time it was hard on your skin. Then of course,
there weren’t any nylons or anything, because everything went to military, so
we would just take eyebrow pencil and draw a line down the back of our leg, like
we had stockings on, and then put pancake makeup on.

DUNHAM: How long did that take to prepare?

GRIMES: Oh, I guess it depends upon how slow you were and who was helping you.

DUNHAM: Who was helping you, your mom?

GRIMES: Yeah, Mother would help me.

DUNHAM: What else in your initial days of being a scale do you recall?

GRIMES: Well, because I was small, they have double bottoms and all these little
ladders you have to crawl up and down. They had -- I can’t remember what
they’re called, but -- these huge round things. They would stack them up and
the welders would weld them. Then they would drop me down inside to scale off
the weld. Well, one time they forgot I was down there. It was all noisy and
everything -- it was change of shift -- and I thought, “Oh, my God.” They
finally heard me and pulled me out.

DUNHAM: Because you couldn’t have gotten out of there?

GRIMES: No, no, I couldn’t get out myself at all. No, they would just drop me
down in there, and then to lift me out. Yeah, it’s just all the little things
that was crazy.

DUNHAM: What was the makeup of the workforce? Were other scalers mainly men or women?

GRIMES: We were mostly all women. I don’t remember any men scalers. We did
have a lot of elderly men, or men that couldn’t get into the service because
of health reasons. We had a lot of men out there that should be getting credit,
too, for what they did, really.

DUNHAM: We’ve interviewed some of them.

GRIMES: Yeah, you really should.

DUNHAM: But because they tended to be older, unfortunately, we didn’t start
interviewing in time for most of them. But we’ve interviewed some men who
worked there.

GRIMES: Have you?

DUNHAM: Yes. Yeah, definitely. Oh, you just made me think of something else. I
know Richmond went from 20,000 to 120,000 during this war.

GRIMES: When we came over from Pinole, down -- I don’t remember which highway
we took but, but when we drove down in there, I was never so shocked in my life,
because like I said, I lived a very sheltered life. There were people living in
ditches, tents, lean-tos, anyplace and everywhere. It was a shock, because there
was no place to live. Not until [Henry J.] Kaiser started building stuff for
people. Dormitories and places for them to live. He did a wonderful job. But
there was just no place. The shows, naturally, stayed open day and night because
everything did. Nothing closed. Nothing. So people would go into the theaters
and sleep. It’s the only thing they had.

DUNHAM: Right. And the bowling alleys, I heard, as well.

GRIMES: Yeah, yeah, anything, yeah.

DUNHAM: So did you go up to the shows and such?

GRIMES: Not so much here, no. When I was in Rockford as a kid I went a lot
because the folks were making pretty good money, and I would go to the cowboy
shows every Saturday.

DUNHAM: What were those like?

GRIMES: Oh, my God. Lone Ranger and Hopalong Cassidy.

DUNHAM: So these are the movies?

GRIMES: Yeah, the movies. And they always had the serials.

DUNHAM: What were you doing during the war years, during your off hours and for fun?

GRIMES: Well, it was a long trip going over and back, and you’re tired; you
just went to bed. Because the tunnel only had two lanes, and we would have to
leave -- I forget what time -- early, early in the morning. Then my dad would
drop us off across -- there was a restaurant across the street from One, where
we worked, and he worked in Three. He had to be there, so he’d drop us off,
and we’d have to wait. He’d go on to work, and then when our time come, then
we’d go across the street to work. So it was a long trip in the car.

DUNHAM: How long did it take, and what was that drive like then, compared to now?

GRIMES: Dark, cold, and miserable, that’s how I remember that. I remember,
when I was cold you’d get the old blankets and try to wrap up. Of course, you
had to keep the headlights stripped so that you’d only have a strip of light.

DUNHAM: Because it was wartime?

GRIMES: Well, yeah, everything here. And at the shipyards we had the
antiaircraft guns on top all the time. And your blinds had to be closed -- well,
because we were on the coast. We were on the coast.

DUNHAM: So there were air raid sirens?

GRIMES: Air raid sirens, yeah.

DUNHAM: How often, and what happened when they went off?

GRIMES: Well, out here we didn’t hear them as much as you did in there. You
just wait and look and wait. There wasn’t anyplace for maybe us to hide.

CARLYLE: During the war, when he said, “What did you do in your free time?,”
did you guys not help at Aunt Ginger’s club, because she entertained -- ?

GRIMES: I didn’t; I was too young.

CARLYLE: Weren’t you and Sonny over there at her club?

GRIMES: No, we just lived there. No.

DUNHAM: So you passed at work, but you weren’t able to get into the clubs?

GRIMES: We’d walk through and up the stairs and stuff, but we were not allowed
to be in the clubs, no. But she had the restaurant next door, where we ate.

DUNHAM: Was eighteen the legal age, at that point, for the club?

GRIMES: I can’t remember. I think so. I think with military, it was more than
that, and it was a problem because military couldn’t go in the clubs, supposedly.

DUNHAM: Supposedly; but did they?

GRIMES: Yeah, because they were only eighteen. That changed, in later years.

DUNHAM: So let’s see. Your father was working as a welder?

GRIMES: No, he was an electrician.

DUNHAM: Electrician, pardon me. What do you know of his experiences as an electrician?

GRIMES: Well, I know he was either a leaderman or a foreman, I can’t remember
which one. He was quite a ways up there. We have a picture of him that was
signed by Kaiser, on one of the ships he worked on. But I really don’t
remember that much. All I know is he was very good at whatever he did. He was
just a natural-born person that could do anything.

DUNHAM: Your aunt who had the club also did entertain at the shipyards?

GRIMES: She did, yeah. The way it started out there is they tried to get -- they
would get the Andrews Sisters and Sophie Tucker. Well, Sophie Tucker couldn’t
go one day, and my aunt was very well-known in town, so they asked her to go
out. So she used to go out and start entertaining. We always had entertainment
in the afternoon, if you could be there.

DUNHAM: Were you able to be there?

GRIMES: I was there once or twice, yeah, yeah.

DUNHAM: Your aunt, she sang and danced?

GRIMES: She sang, yeah. She wasn’t really much of a dance dancer, except like
in performing hulas and stuff like that. But she sang. She was more on the
rougher type, like a Sophie Tucker.

DUNHAM: You mentioned performing hulas; as a kid, you did that. Was that
Hawaiian-style hula?

GRIMES: Yeah, well, my mother taught me that. I was never allowed to be like a
showgirl, because they didn’t want me to do that; but she did teach me a
little bit of that. So all the rich neighbors that came used to get a kick out
of that. They’d buy their chickens and tomatoes, and I would give them a hula.

DUNHAM: As a bonus, huh? Did you ever want to be a showgirl?

GRIMES: I did, but it was, no. They said that’s a no-no, all of them did. I
guess it was a pretty rough life.

DUNHAM: So how long were you a scaler at the shipyards?

GRIMES: Oh, I don’t remember month-wise. But after a while, my wrists gave
out, and I kept having to wear supports on them. So they transferred me to the
war bond department and I operated the graphotype. I made the metal plates where
the names and address went on your war bonds, or Victory Bonds, whatever you
want to call them. That’s what I did for a while.

DUNHAM: How did you do that? How did that work?

GRIMES: Well, it was fine, because I knew how to type because I used to write
plays when I was a kid, and I was very good at it. My dad had bought me a
typewriter when I was in fifth grade or so, so I had taught myself how to type,
so I didn’t have any problem with that. With the graphotype, you don’t have
to be speedy; you just to be accurate. So I did good on that.

DUNHAM: I’m not familiar with the graphotype. What does that look like, or how
does it work?

GRIMES: Well, it’s a big machine. Have you ever seen how they make credit
cards? Or how they used to? Well, it’s the same type of thing, except
everything is backwards. When you read it, it’s backwards. These were metal
plates, sharp metal plates that we used. It was just that you punch the keys.
You had the applications. You filled in an application for your war bonds, and
then I would type up the information, and then proofread it and get it back. I
liked that, yeah.

DUNHAM: Did you and your family buy war bonds?

GRIMES: Oh, yeah, we did. But I only have the empty book; I don’t have the
stamps. I think they were ten cents apiece or something like that.

DUNHAM: You mentioned writing plays. This was back in Wisconsin?

GRIMES: Yes.

DUNHAM: Did you continue to write when you were out here?

GRIMES: No, I didn’t. And I should have; I was very good at it. I used to
write the school plays.

DUNHAM: So they were put on in the school?

GRIMES: Yeah.

DUNHAM: And did you perform in them, as well?

GRIMES: Yeah, that’s right.

DUNHAM: Do you remember what any of them were about?

GRIMES: A lot of them were like the radio programs that you watched, like Baby
Snooks and those type of things. Mostly comedy.

HANSON: We keep telling her she needs to write a book about her life.

DUNHAM: That would be great. Well, maybe when you get this, that can help
stimulating thinking about that again.

GRIMES: That would be nice, yeah.

DUNHAM: I wanted to ask, when you were first working in the shipyards --
sometimes we’ve heard, you starting in ’43 a couple years in, but that it
was still -- men gave women a hard time sometimes, and it could be a little
challenging, in that regard. How was that?

GRIMES: Yeah. I don’t really remember them giving me a bad time, but you
couldn’t get any information out of them. Nobody wanted to help you. That’s
like I said, they handed me this hundred-pound air pressure gun with a chisel.
And that’s got to be in there right. Poor dumb me. But you learn the hard way.

DUNHAM: Why do you think that was?

GRIMES: The olden days. It’s just that’s the way men were. It was a man’s
world, and they weren’t used to women being out in it, I guess.

DUNHAM: How about the mix of races and people coming from all over the country?

GRIMES: Oh, we had everything and anything. Of course, I was never raised to be
a racist type of person, so it didn’t matter to me whether they were Japanese,
Chinese, whatever. If I liked a person, I liked them; if they treated me right,
that’s all that counted. We had a lot of black, and I can remember when I
first went, that most of the black people were picking up nuts and bolts, before
they were really given decent jobs. Then they found out that, yeah, they can.

DUNHAM: Do you know what that job was called then, if they were just kind of
doing that?

GRIMES: No, just labor. Just labor.

DUNHAM: Anything else you did as a scaler? Or the main thing was following the
welders and -- ?

GRIMES: Yeah, and then if there were debris afterwards, you’d have to clean
up. If we were on the ship itself, doing something, then we would have to sweep
up. I can’t remember whether one of the other girls and I had a radio or
whether they played music or whatever, but she and I used to dance with a broom
when we weren’t being watched.

DUNHAM: Tell us about that.

GRIMES: Mostly with the Andrews Sisters; we loved that. So we’d be dancing
with the broom, and then here’d come the boss. We never got fired for it, but
it was kind of fun.

DUNHAM: Were there other things you did when you weren’t busy working, when
you maybe had breaks or time?

GRIMES: Not really. Well, you had a break, but I can’t remember doing
anything. Even nowadays, if you give me a break at work, I’d just rather be working.

DUNHAM: We’ve heard, with all the different folks, sometimes there were some
shenanigans going on in the shipyard. Maybe more than just dancing. You
mentioned knowing a lot about gambling. Did you ever see any gambling going on?

GRIMES: No, I didn’t. I’ve heard that they would sneak stuff in and out,
like alcohol in their thermoses. That part, I did hear from my mother. Or try to
steal wires or something, anything that they could get out the gates. But
outside of that -- there were fights with guys. Not so much women, that I can
remember, but guys would get in fights.

DUNHAM: Did you see any of those?

GRIMES: No, I didn’t, I just heard. Well, my husband, or future husband, got
into one with a guy. It was a stupid thing, but it was a big fight.

DUNHAM: Do you know what it was about then?

GRIMES: Oh, he put something in his lunchbox that wasn’t presentable to him.
He had a very bad temper anyway, and I guess he really just knocked him out.
That’s about -- that one, I remember. But that’s the kind of stuff that went
on, prank stuff.

DUNHAM: Your husband, you said, then worked in the Coast Guard Police, as well, right?

GRIMES: Mm-hm.

DUNHAM: Did he have any stories about having to deal with challenging situations?

GRIMES: Not really. Not to me. But see, with him, I was still a kid.

DUNHAM: How old was your husband? How much older was he than you?

GRIMES: He was eighteen.

DUNHAM: Oh, so he was very young, too.

GRIMES: Yeah, yeah.

DUNHAM: So you married soon thereafter?

GRIMES: I got married in 1944. Met him, and then left in early ’44 and moved
back to Missouri and got married.

DUNHAM: Was that where he was from?

GRIMES: Yeah.

DUNHAM: What was Missouri like?

GRIMES: Hah. [laughs] Worse than Okauchee. Oh, my God, yeah.

DUNHAM: How so?

GRIMES: Oh, yeah. Quite an adjustment to that type of living.

CARLYLE: Rural.

GRIMES: Yeah, very rural.

DUNHAM: What part of Missouri?

GRIMES: Greentop and Sublette. They were about ten miles from Kirksville.

DUNHAM: What were you and he doing there in Missouri?

GRIMES: Nothing, really. He was still a kid. We stayed with his father and his stepmother.

DUNHAM: So there wasn’t work to be had there?

GRIMES: Well, at one point, he had gone on to {Idowa?} and worked at the
ordinance plant and different things. He couldn’t find himself. It was just
one thing and then another.

DUNHAM: Then you had your first child soon then?

GRIMES: Yeah. She was born in Missouri. In Greentop, Missouri.

DUNHAM: How long were you in Missouri then?

GRIMES: Oh, not too long, because we traveled quite a bit. Then we went to
Florida for a while, and then back out here, and then back to Missouri. He just
had that sand-in-the-shoes feeling.

DUNHAM: So all through the forties, kind of, and beyond?

GRIMES: Yeah, yeah.

DUNHAM: You worked in the war bond department for a little bit. Now, I was
looking at your union cards that you scanned. Do you remember about joining the union?

GRIMES: Very little. I didn’t know that much about it; all I knew is you had
to join the union. I’m sure my mother was with me.

DUNHAM: What I wanted to ask was the different sort of names there. The first
one said, the International Hod Carriers Building and Common Laborers Union.

GRIMES: Yeah, that was the laborers. Yeah, it was weird, huh?

DUNHAM: That was when you were a scaler?

GRIMES: Yeah.

DUNHAM: And then it said Shipyard and Marine Shop Laborers, so that was maybe
the local outfit. Then I saw Office Workers Union, which I assume was when you
were with the war bonds work.

GRIMES: Right.

DUNHAM: But then I saw General Truck Drivers and Helpers, in Contra Costa
County. Was that for you?

GRIMES: Yeah, it was my name on it. I worked three different unions, but I never
could figure that -- .

DUNHAM: That was just while you were working at the shipyards, too?

GRIMES: Yeah, yeah. I don’t know where that came in. No, I don’t know.

DUNHAM: You’ve talked about your mom being very patriotic. How did you feel
about the war effort and kind of your working there?

GRIMES: I don’t think I really thought too much about it until we were out
here and I would see the convoys going by. In those days, we had the truck
convoys, with all the service people. My aunt that had the nightclub, very
patriotic. Always for the servicemen, when they came. But I don’t think I
really thought too much about it. I knew my uncles were both in the service. One
of them was in Alaska. I’ve forgot where it was already; way out in the end of
it. And one of them was in Africa; he was an airplane mechanic. But outside of
that, I don’t really -- I was thinking about that the other day; I don’t
even really think I thought much about it. We knew everything was rationed. You
couldn’t have this, that. You’d get in a line to maybe wait for butter, if
you had a stamp for it. Gasoline was hard to get.

DUNHAM: With your long commute, was that a problem?

GRIMES: Well, we all had the stamps, and so -- .

DUNHAM: Okay. How many of you were commuting together?

GRIMES: Well, it was me and my dad and my mother. Of course, you got stamps the
minute a child was born, so -- then she had a neighbor back here that rode with
us for a while, and then Dale would ride with us. So we all chipped in together
on that.

DUNHAM: So Dale initially moved out here with you guys?

GRIMES: Yeah, for a little while, yeah. But with gas, I think those that worked
in that industry got a little better rate, or a little better amount that they
could get, than somebody else.

DUNHAM: Why did you move out to Missouri?

GRIMES: Why’d I go to Missouri? It’s because his folks were there and he
wanted to go see them

DUNHAM: Did you know that you would be kind of leaving indefinitely, when you went?

GRIMES: No. At that age, you don’t really think that -- I didn’t think that
much, just go.

DUNHAM: How did you travel?

GRIMES: Bus. Greyhound bus.

DUNHAM: What was a Greyhound bus like in ’44?

GRIMES: Miserable. I think it took five days. Yeah, miserable.

DUNHAM: Were you pregnant then?

GRIMES: No.

DUNHAM: So at least it wasn’t that, too.

GRIMES: No. Yeah. Yeah, bad enough that way.

DUNHAM: Do you remember where you stopped on that bus journey?

GRIMES: No. They made several stops, but as I say, it was a miserable trip.
Because we didn’t have bathrooms on them, like they do nowadays. You’d have
to wait till you got to a stop.

DUNHAM: And then would the bathrooms vary? Or would it just be maybe on the side
of the road?

GRIMES: Oh, it was like anyplace else. Yeah, sometimes good, sometimes bad.

DUNHAM: You mentioned the convoys. Were those right down Danville Boulevard?

GRIMES: Yeah.

DUNHAM: Yeah, so right by your house?

GRIMES: Yeah. Because they had fort -- and I forget what is over here near
Livermore. And then we had Fort Ord, up in Monterey. I forgot the one that was
over here; it was an Army fort of some kind.

DUNHAM: So was there a particular way family and you would observe, when they
came by?

GRIMES: Oh, just wave to everybody.

DUNHAM: Just wave, yeah, yeah.

GRIMES: It was just a little two-way street. We always waved at all of them.

DUNHAM: I know a lot of times, because you were a kid, you said that your
parents and aunt didn’t talk to you so much about it. Did they ever, later,
kind of tell you about their experiences during that time? Running a nightclub,
I know you said she was open to the soldiers, but must’ve been in that
boomtown, right?

GRIMES: Yeah, boomtown. I remember a lot about, well, the gangster talk and
stuff like that. There was a lot of that.

DUNHAM: Yeah. Well, I haven’t heard much about that. Can you tell me a little
about what -- ?

GRIMES: Well, I can’t remember Pechart’s first name, but he ran the whole
Contra Costa County. He had a big, beautiful home there in El Cerrito. A few
years, or a few months ago -- or maybe last year -- I know one of the places
where he lived, they were going to remodel it, and they found all these steel
doors and everything. Yeah, he was mafia, one of the big ones. He ran
everything. Everything.

DUNHAM: Yeah. So what, that meant gambling?

GRIMES: Gambling -- .

DUNHAM: Liquor or drugs at the time?

GRIMES: Yeah, horse races.

DUNHAM: Where were the horse races then, do you know?

GRIMES: Well, I can’t remember. Do you remember the name of the -- ? Out there?

CARLYLE: There’s one that’s still out there.

GRIMES: Golden Gate Fields. It used to smell real bad. There was no control over
the sewage out there. When you could cross that bridge, my God, you’d want to
die. But that’s where they had horse races.

DUNHAM: Did you ever go there?

GRIMES: No, I didn’t. My uncle used to go all the time, but I didn’t.

CARLYLE: Mom, tell him about Aunt Ginger recording when Uncle Bill came home and
had to go back, and they had all the sailors and all the military people talk
over at Club Thunderbird.

GRIMES: Well, she did a lot of that. She entertained. We do have a tape
someplace, but I don’t know where it’s at. They weren’t talking very nice
about the Japanese, of course.

DUNHAM: Sure, yeah. During the war, yeah.

GRIMES: Yeah. Was a whole bunch of them, and she interviewed every one of them.
I don’t know where that tape is; I got it here someplace.

DUNHAM: Interviewed them during that time?

GRIMES: In her nightclub. In her nightclub, when they would come in, yeah.

DUNHAM: So what was that recorded on, on a reel-to-reel?

CARLYLE: Originally, it was a reel -- . Well, we don’t know, originally.

GRIMES: No.

CARLYLE: She had it re-done to eight track, and then later, to a DVD.

DUNHAM: Well, I would be very interested in hearing that.

GRIMES: Okay, I’ll see if I can find it.

DUNHAM: Would you be open to our possibly transcribing that, if it -- ?

GRIMES: Oh, sure.

DUNHAM: We don’t mind the rough talk. That’s a primary document that would
be of interest.

GRIMES: They should be all in that one place where -- my mother was great on
recording everything and anything. We’ve got tapes from, my God, before she
was born or where she was little. So I spent several thousand dollars and went
down, because it was done on those big reel-type, and I had them all redone on
CDs. I’ll see if I can find that for you.

DUNHAM: But so you were describing, so this is just soldiers who were visiting.

GRIMES: Sailors.

DUNHAM: She would interview them about their experiences?

GRIMES: Mm-hm. Because my uncle had come back from Kodiak, Alaska, and he had
brought three friends with him. They stopped at my aunt’s club, and she put
them up there while they were on leave. So that she was interviewing them before
they had to leave again. They had to go out again, and go back. So we found that
one day.

DUNHAM: So it’s your uncle and his fellow soldiers.

GRIMES: Mm-hm, mm-hm. He was a Seabee.

CARLYLE: It had Aunt Scottie on it, too, and Aunt Scottie worked at the
shipyard, too.

GRIMES: Yeah. I have her picture there, too.

DUNHAM: Aunt Scottie was the welder? Or she was also -- ?

GRIMES: No, she was a welder, and then Mother got her a job out with the Coast
Guard Police.

DUNHAM: Oh, and she transferred. What else do you remember about Kaiser and the
shipyards and patriotism at the shipyards, or other guests?

GRIMES: Everybody was very, very patriotic. You thought nothing about having to
give up types of food, meat, bacon, anything. Everybody was very patriotic. More
so than I can ever remember before. It just was nothing. If you used up your
coupons and couldn’t get anymore, tough. You didn’t worry about that. That
was it. You knew it had to go to our military.

DUNHAM: Was there anything you particularly missed?

GRIMES: It’s not that you missed it, but the harder things were gasoline and
butter and bacon; and of course, meat was a no-no. You just got canned goods, if
you could.

CARLYLE: You still don’t like Spam.

GRIMES: No, I can’t eat Spam by itself, no.

DUNHAM: Did you have to during that time?

GRIMES: We had Spam, yeah. Of course, when we went to work, my mother made fried
egg sandwiches for us, or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches; that’s what we had.

DUNHAM: I know with the gas being limited, it was hard to get around extra, but
did you travel ever to San Francisco or elsewhere around the Bay Area, at that time?

GRIMES: Not during the wartime. Afterwards, we did, but not during that.

DUNHAM: You always worked the day shift, too, is that right?

GRIMES: Yeah. Yeah.

DUNHAM: Were you working six days a week?

GRIMES: Five.

DUNHAM: What did you do evenings and weekends?

GRIMES: Well, we had walnut trees. During the season, we had to take care of the
walnut trees. Like I said, there were two and a half acres here; you had to see
that it was weeded and get somebody to disc for you.

DUNHAM: What is that, disc?

GRIMES: Well, that’s what the farmers did when they have this big metal thing,
and they go through the fields and make the furrows. That got the weeds up.

CARLYLE: Kind of like plowing.

GRIMES: There was an old man here -- we called him Nature Boy -- and we used to
hire him to come in and do the discing for us, because you had to keep the weeds
down because of fir</transcript><transcript_alt></transcript_alt><rights></rights><fmt></fmt><usage></usage><userestrict>0</userestrict><xmllocation></xmllocation><xmlfilename></xmlfilename><collection_link></collection_link><series_link></series_link></record></ROOT>
