SELVIDGE: Okay. So this is our tape one, August 11, 2010. This is Sarah
Selvidge. Just go ahead and say and spell your name.

CHAPPAT: My name is Eleth Chappat. Eleth is E-L-E-T-H. Chappat is C-H-A-P-P-A-T.

SELVIDGE: Great. So I’d like to start more or less from the beginning and have
you talk a little bit about when you were born and your family and sort of your
early life as a child.

CHAPPAT: I was born and raised in Ojai, California on July 2, 1925. And then
when I got a little older, we moved to Ventura. So I was raised in Ventura
County. I went to several schools because my parents moved around quite a bit.
So my education, I didn’t get too much because they moved all the time. I
don’t know. My dad couldn’t get a job, but when he did, then we’d have to
move to it. So it was just moving all the time as a kid. So that’s what happened.

SELVIDGE: So you moved around a lot in the Southern California area?

CHAPPAT: Moved a lot. I think our biggest move was to Bakersfield and he wanted
to become a contractor and sell houses and things. Then he took sick and he
couldn’t sell the houses, so we had to move back to Ventura. We went to Ojai
every Sunday to my grandmother’s house for dinner. That went on every Sunday
of the year. This one particular Sunday, we were on our way to Ojai to go have
dinner with grandma and the radio came on and President Roosevelt said, “We
have declared war on Japan.” And the chills and everything just went through
our bodies. We couldn’t believe it. So when we got to Ojai and we turned the
radio on and we heard about Pearl Harbor being bombed. It was awful. Just
silence all over the country. So we ate our dinner and went to church and
everything and prayed for peace and stuff. Then we went back to Ventura and soon
my dad got a job in San Francisco building a shipyard at Marinship in Sausalito.

SELVIDGE: Oh, okay. So you were just a teenager then.

CHAPPAT: I was sixteen. SELVIDGE: I’d be almost seventeen.

SELVIDGE: And so after moving around and your father working in agricultural and
other types of jobs, you followed him to San Francisco as a whole family?

CHAPPAT: No.

CHAPPAT: Oh, no. Okay. Just tell me who went with your father.

CHAPPAT: My dad had to go and he lived on --

CHAPPAT: Oh, just your father.

CHAPPAT: My dad. CHAPPAT: He went up there because they had to build the
shipyard before they could build ships. So I think it took a year. So after the
year, he called and came down and got me and took me back on a bus. I was
seventeen by now. So I tried to get a job up there but nobody would hire me.

SELVIDGE: Why wouldn’t they hire you?

CHAPPAT: I was too young.

SELVIDGE: Too young.

CHAPPAT: So my dad used to give me five dollars to go to the show or something
like that. Then Roosevelt called out to the country and said that women were
needed in the shipyards. By this time the yards were all finished and ready to
build ships. So my dad, he says, “Come on, I’m going to get you a job.” I
said, “Doing what?” He says, “Welding.” He says, “Now, when you start
to arc -- “ I didn’t know what an arc was -- he said, “you strike it like
a match.” Strike it like a match. He pounded that into my head and I had to go
to the class at midnight until eight o’clock the next morning. So I went into
the class. I was striking that thing like a match and it didn’t work. Didn’t
work. And I’m so upset over it because I’m not going to get a job because I
can’t do it. So the instructor came by and he says, “What’s the matter,
miss?” I said, “I can’t do this job. It don’t work.” He said, “Well,
hon, you don’t have your machine hot enough.” He says, “Let’s turn it
up,” and he put the proper heat on it and I struck it. I was on my way! I did
vertical, I did overhead and I passed. They hired me. So my dad bought me the
leathers to go to work. My mother put them in a big suitcase. So here’s this
seventeen year old kid going into the shipyard.

SELVIDGE: Yes, wow. I have a couple of questions before we get to the shipyard.
I’m wondering, first, did the rest of your family stay in Ventura then?

CHAPPAT: In Ventura. Yes.

SELVIDGE: Oh, so it was just you and your dad at the shipyards?

CHAPPAT: Yes. Yes.

SELVIDGE: And how many siblings did you have?

CHAPPAT: Well, my mother had nine children. One died. She was a young widow at
age 22 or 23. She had to adopt three of them out. She was washing dishes in the
Ojai hotel and she couldn’t support them and everything and this rich family
wanted to adopt them. She didn’t want to do it but her father said, “You
can’t support them. They can get an education with this family.” So she let
them go. In the meantime, she met my dad in Ojai and they got married.

SELVIDGE: Oh, so she was a single mother before then?

CHAPPAT: Right. She was a single mother. Had five children and she adopted the
youngest three out. Kept Bud and my sister, Florence.

SELVIDGE: Wow.

CHAPPAT: Then she married my dad and eventually he had three girls and a son who
died during birth.

SELVIDGE: He had three girls with your mom? Together?

CHAPPAT: Yes. So I have two sisters and I have one half-sister and one half-brother.

SELVIDGE: And, if you don’t mind my asking a couple of questions about that.

CHAPPAT: No, go ahead.

SELVIDGE: Did your mother keep contact with the children that were adopted or
was it just --

CHAPPAT: She kept in contact with the youngest boy, Jerry. Alvin, the oldest,
went to New York and he invested in radio. Then when TV came in, he was a big
shot in TV. Then the other boy, John, became a mortician. He had three or four
mortuaries there in Inglewood, and then he built a beautiful mortuary in Palm
Springs. But we knew all about the boys. Yes.

SELVIDGE: So you did hear news of them and your mother was able to know that
they were doing well?

CHAPPAT: Yes.

SELVIDGE: And you said you did keep in contact, in closer contact, with one?

CHAPPAT: With the youngest boy, Jerry.

SELVIDGE: With the youngest boy.

CHAPPAT: He was an embalmer. Yes.

SELVIDGE: And did he live close to you, then?

CHAPPAT: No, he lived in Long Beach, down in there.

SELVIDGE: Oh, okay. But the family that adopted him did sort of maintain ties
with him?

CHAPPAT: Oh, yes.

SELVIDGE: Interesting. So it was a pretty big family then.

CHAPPAT: Oh, yes. At that point my mother and two sisters, they stayed in
Ventura until my dad got situated up here. I stayed in a hotel with him. The
police came one day and wanted to know why this man had a young girl with him.
We happened to be father and daughter, so that was okay. Then my sister June,
she came up and she got a job at the shipyard as a rigger. I think she was the
only rigger in the United States! She did a real good job.

SELVIDGE: What do you mean when you say she’s the only rigger? The only woman --

CHAPPAT: A woman. Woman rigger.

SELVIDGE: -- that’s a rigger. Yes.

CHAPPAT: And then my other sister, the oldest one, Esther, she got a job as a
sweeper. She used to sweep. But she was real feminine, real pretty woman. She
couldn’t work there. It was too dirty. She only lasted three days.

SELVIDGE: She didn’t like it?

CHAPPAT: No, she didn’t like it. She got a job at Safeway.
