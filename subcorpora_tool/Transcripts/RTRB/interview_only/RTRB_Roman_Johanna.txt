FARRELL: This is Shanna Farrell with Johanna Roman on Friday, September 18,
2015, and this is our interview for the Rosie the Riveter project. Johanna, can
you start by telling me where and when you were born, and a little bit about
your early life?

ROMAN: I was born in Breslau, Germany, July 28, 1925. My family emigrated in
1928, when I was three years old, to New York City. I’ve spent most of my life
in New York City. I grew up here, I was educated here. Of course I’ve been
away from New York as well, traveling around much. I’ve lived here, I married
here, had a child here. I’m a New Yorker, with one foot in Europe.

FARRELL: Do you have any memories from Germany, when you were younger?

ROMAN: Yes, I do. I suppose, I don’t know whether it’s called gifted or
lucky or not, but I do have, considering my age, what’s considered an
excellent memory. I have very good recall, and you don’t want me to recall
everything, it’ll be much too long. But I do remember particularly at my
paternal, and maternal, grandparents’ home, little incidents. Nothing
traumatic, always very pleasant, very pretty, the surroundings. I also remember
where I lived. We lived in a very contemporary, at the time, modern garden
apartment. In the back was a playground for children. I had a nanny. There was a
beautiful park across the street, I have a picture of it in my mind. It was very
pleasant. I also remember the trip coming over here on a ship called the
Deutschland. It was a Hansa Lloyd ship. One incident is very, very clear in my
mind. I had a huge teddy bear -- of course we remember things sometimes bigger
than they are -- it was one of those wonderful German old teddy bears -- I
forget the name of the company but it was very famously sold here too -- almost
as big as I was, and when we left the ship, it was lost. I never took it with
me. And I remember crying about that. Okay, that sets a pattern for fear of
loss, right? Page Freud. [Laughs] I’ve always spoken two languages. I don’t
remember a time when I didn’t speak German or didn’t speak English. I’m
still fluent in German because we spoke German at home, and I’ve traveled to
Europe a great deal in my adulthood, I have friends in Europe. Mostly in the
German-speaking countries, like Austria, Switzerland, parts of Czechoslovakia.
My mother was part Czech, part Austrian, so I was always interested in those
countries. We lived in the Bronx. I went to local schools there. Because I was
artistic, I mean artistic as a painter, so-called, gifted and painting, I
applied for a special high school. Even in those days there was some form of
open enrollment. It was a school called Washington Irving High School, which had
an academic art department. Half of it was commercial, half of it was for
students who wanted to study arts. My ambition was to be a designer for theater
and stage. That was a highfalutin’ ambition. I was about fifteen when the war
started; I was still in high school. In 1943 I was graduated from Washington
Irving. I didn’t go to college then, the war was on and there were a very
strong desire on everyone’s part to do something for the war effort. I took a
temporary job, using my art. I was painting -- coloring photos, when somehow, I
don’t remember where I saw a listing for examinations for training women, with
many kinds of men’s jobs among them, aircraft mechanic. I always had a great
interest in aviation. Also, I had good mechanical abilities. I passed an arduous
test where your, I’ve forgotten the word, for your mechanical ability --
aptitude is the word, thank you. Aptitude, mechanical aptitude was excellent, so
I was accepted in the program, along with a close friend. Of course we did
everything together as teenagers, and she got in too. The program had a training
point at the Academy of Aeronautics, which was just across from La Guardia
Airport, sort of an extension to La Guardia Airport. There was a three-month,
only a three-month training program, I did that. When you signed up, it was like
signing up for the military. As a matter of fact, I should go back, that I
wanted to join the WAVEs or the WACs at the time, the women’s military corps.
But I was very petite, I didn’t weigh 110 pounds, there was a prerequisite for
a certain weight and height then, of course. I was not eligible for that, but I
certainly was eligible for training as aircraft mechanic. But when you signed
up, you had no choice of where you were being sent. You were going to be sent to
one of the major airports. We were sent to Presque Isle, Maine, which was the
last point of flying off in the United States. I went up there in the spring of
1945, the war had not ended yet in Europe, it was just about to. We were based
at a normal school, which was a teaching school at the time. We lived in the
dormitories, it was all very pleasant, and we were assigned to different
hangars. And there’s an interesting little side story to that. Since a lot of
the mechanics were women, there were a few fellows. We were not at first given
the jobs we were trained for. We were washing parts in kerosene. We had no
gloves to protect our skin. We were doing what I would consider the menial jobs.
So a group of us organized a strike, a protest, shall we say. We wouldn’t work
-- it only lasted a couple of days. I mean, we demanded and then negotiated that
we would be given the proper jobs we were trained for, that washing parts should
be done on a rotation basis. So we won that one.

FARRELL: Before we get into a little bit, because I want to talk to you a little
bit more about your training, I want to back up a little bit and ask you a
little bit more about your parents and some of your early memories. Can you tell
me about both of your parents, what their names were and some of your early memories?

ROMAN: Yes. My mother’s name was Frieda, my father’s name was Louis, changed
from Ludwig. My father was very militant about the war. We were German Jews, by
the way. Nevertheless, I had a brother, who’s since died, died a few years
ago, my brother was very self-conscious about our speaking German if he had
friends up. He’d say, “Please don’t speak German” -- he was born here,
in the States. “Please don’t speak German when my friends are here,
they’ll think we’re Nazis!” [Laughs] It was a very sensitive time, of
course. Both my parents were very well educated. My father had been in textiles.
We came here just in time for the Great Depression. Lost everything. My mother
was more upper-middle class, my father was a good middle-class family. My
paternal grandmother did something very unusual for her time. She was a midwife
and a career woman. In fact, she came here a couple of years after we had
emigrated to see us, of course, but to visit New York hospitals, maternity
departments and so on. So she was quite an advanced person. My mother was an
early flower child. She was the dreamer, my father was the practical one. I
would say now I was a father’s daughter. I had the play ethics from my mother
and the work ethic from my father, so there’s a nice balance there and I’m
still that way today. We had a lot of music in my home. My mother was a pianist,
that is, not a concert pianist, but she was very well educated musically, and my
father too. The big memory I have is that there was always music in our home. My
parents were very compatible, everyone called them Romeo and Juliet, they were
lovely. And I thought everybody was that way at home. That was my vision of
marriage. My father came here, as I said, lost everything, could not find work,
and through an uncle who had been here, he became a house painter and became
involved in, in those days, union activities and enjoyed his life that way, and
still was able to take care of his family. During the war my mother, who had had
some basic nursing training in Europe, volunteered for some hospital work. My
father, I don’t know how many pints of blood he gave, because he had O type
blood. In fact, recently, I sold at an auction letters tom my father from the
mayor’s office here at that time, La Guardia, signed letters by Fiorello,
commending him. And he had a letter from the White House at the time, too,
signed by McIntyre, representing President Roosevelt. I was very proud of those.
I don’t know if I can call it poverty, but we lived on the thin line. When the
war started -- well, if you know the history of the Depression, I lived through
that, I grew up in that time here. We had food, we had clothing, we had shelter.
That was it. I never asked my parents for allowance, because I knew things were
slim. What I remember best about my youth is the culture. It’s what made me
what I am, I guess, till today.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about that: what you remember, the
culture, or how that influenced you?

ROMAN: Early on, my parents were reading Shakespeare to me, they were very well
read. I always read a lot. I realize now I was probably a nerd kid, but I was
also very pretty, and a conflict came in because I got more attention than I
really should have, and I didn’t even want it. People pay a lot of attention
to looks. I was maybe a little prettier than most pretty kids are when I was
very young, and that always bothered me, too, so I sort of ignored that part of
it. I’ve never let looks interfere with what I wanted to do or how I reacted
to people. Because I know that passes. I knew that somehow, even very young,
that you don’t rely on that. In fact, as I was growing up and looking for
jobs, I would dress down so that people wouldn’t pay so much attention to how
I looked. I wanted them to pay attention to who I was and what I knew, that was
important: what I knew. So the intellectual aspect of life was also very
important in our home. My mother knew an awful lot. She was so well read. She
collected every book of Dickens and read every book Dickens ever wrote. Of
course they were both bilingual, that’s another thing, once they came here.
She was a wonderful baker, I learned to bake and cook from her. They loved
theater, drama, opera. Even the little we had, they managed somehow to do that.
And also to develop a love for that in me. My father was very strict. I was
brought up in a very Germanic way, with all that love and everything, you know,
nevertheless he was very strict. Actually I think my father brought me up more
than my mother; my mother, being bohemian, took an easier view of life. So as I
said, I guess in a way I had the best of both worlds. My mother told me
something very early on; I must have been twelve or thirteen. She said,
“Remember this: you can do anything you want to, even anything a man does, you
can do. Do not become a housewife. It is not rewarding.” So you could say that
both parents had strong feminist views.

FARRELL: How did that influence you later, that statement?

ROMAN: Well, the fact that I actually applied to do a man’s job as an aircraft
mechanic, that’s the result of all that.

FARRELL: So you were in high school when the war started. Do you remember any
conversations that your parents had about the war? Were they in favor of it or
against it, or it was just part of life?

ROMAN: No, they were worried because my father’s parents were still alive, and
so was his sister and husband and children, and of course they were killed by
the Nazis. My mother’s family -- my mother had four brothers, and one of them
went to Israel, although they were not very Jewish, my mother’s family’s
sort of mixed, watered-down Jews, I call it. Let’s see, one went to Israel,
and I think the three others were gone, except one who had emigrated here before
my parents came, my mother’s brother, my uncle Bert. And my aunt Ruth, who
lived to be 102. But she was part of the family, she was a second cousin.

FARRELL: Thinking about, you were from Germany and you had family there, so the
war started when you were in high school, can you tell me about your initial
reaction to the war or your early thoughts before you joined the ATC?

ROMAN: I don’t know. I kind of stuck my head in the sand about being afraid.
But of course my purpose in doing something for the war effort was clear. This
country was very unified during the war. It was a wonderful feeling of, let’s
all take care of this together and take care of each other. When I say I had a
good time during the war, because I grew up in it, it’s a terrible thing to
say, but I did. It was a wonderful time for me. Also, Americans just worked
together. When you hear things about that, it’s absolutely true; I can verify
that. There was a very hopeful environment here that we were going to do this,
we were going to win this thing. And we did, of course. And my father was an air
raid warden. My mother worked, as I told you, volunteered working in the
hospitals. And I join the ATC.

FARRELL: When you were in high school and the war started, had you always known
that you wanted, as soon as you graduated, to go help the war effort?

ROMAN: Yes. As I mentioned, I tried to join the women’s armed forces but was
rejected due to the reasons I’ve already mentioned.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about what that was like for you,
being rejected and then having to find an alternative plan?

ROMAN: I accepted it. I didn’t have a problem with it because if those were
the rules, what was I going to do? I wasn’t all gung-ho, I just thought it was
practical, that’s what it was.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit about when you initially joined the Air
Transport Command, which is also known as the ATC? Maybe you’re being
interviewed, taking the aptitude test on your first day?

ROMAN: I don’t remember much about that. I remember going to a specific
office, and there was a room full of people like myself. My friend Molly and I
did it at the same time. We took the test and we read the rules about if you got
in, where you’d be placed. It was fine, because I guess we had a great sense
of adventure about this whole thing, too. I was kind of pleased that we were
going to be on the east coast. I didn’t realize how vital a spot we were being
sent to, and I’ll tell you why later. It was, as I said, the jumping-off point
from the States. The first place the planes landed from there was Goose Bay,
Greenland, and then they went off to Scotland, to the base in Scotland. You know
what the Air Transport Command did, don’t you?

FARRELL: I do, but for future listeners, do you mind explaining that?

ROMAN: Air Transport Command were cargo flyers, supplies, cargo. The planes they
used, at least the planes we worked on -- shall I go into that now? -- were
mainly the C-54s, they were huge transport planes, propellor. No jet in those
days, yet. They were big empty dugout things, the planes themselves, I learned,
of course, when I started working on them, for supplies they carry over. It was
not manpower that they were flying, but cargo.

FARRELL: You had three months of training at the Academy of Aeronautics in
Queens. Can you tell me a little bit more about your training, what you learned,
the types of things they were teaching you?

ROMAN: Well, let me see. We had training in electricity, electrical work. Basics
of flight, math. God, I wish I had a record of this. And of course the breakdown
and build-up of engines, that was the most important thing, breakdown and
build-up. That’s what we did, actually. The planes would come in to the base,
and you would have to change spark plugs, balance them -- these huge engines
were taken down, taken off, and refreshed for the next flight.

FARRELL: Can you explain a little bit more about what refreshing meant? Was that
taking things, cleaning them in kerosene, or making sure that they worked properly?

ROMAN: Yeah, cleaning, oiling, spark plug change. You cannot compare the flying
today to what it was then. We only had the prop planes. There was timing of the
spark plugs, making sure they shoot off at the right time. Let me see, what
else? It’s been so long. Of course, cleaning the parts. You took things apart
on the engine itself. Really working on engines was the basic thing.

FARRELL: How was that for you, to learn how to do that?

ROMAN: Oh, I loved it. I took to it very quickly. I still do all my mechanical
work. In fact, in my marriage with a pilot, as I mentioned, we were very
compatible, we always said the only thing we’d ever fight over is who’s
going to do the work, that is, the mechanical work around the house or [Laughs] --

FARRELL: So you lived in a group housing for your time during training. What was
that like for you, leaving home and being relatively close to home, but living
in a new situation?

ROMAN: You mean during the Academy of Aeronautics, because we lived off base, as
you know. The government rented space in private homes around Queens, maybe a
walk away or a bus ride away from the academy. I liked it. I enjoyed it very
much, because it was my first time away from home. When I think of it now, I was
pretty courageous for doing that, being independent.

FARRELL: Were you living with -- it wasn’t a coed --

ROMAN: It was a group home. It was coed, but a group home. I shared a room with
Molly, because we knew each other since we were kids. We had our meals there,
our major meals, breakfast and dinner. I can’t remember what we did when
weren’t at the academy. I suppose we just hung out or went to a movie or
studied. We had to study, of course. That’s all I can recall about that time.

FARRELL: So there was ongoing training and education while you were there, and
you were -- were you taking tests?

ROMAN: Oh yes, you had to pass your tests.

FARRELL: What kinds of things were you being tested on?

ROMAN: Well, your knowledge of electricity that they had tried to teach you. The
basics of flight. The plane parts. That’s what we were being tested on.

FARRELL: So while you were in training, you got word -- you knew that you were
going to have to move to a new location --

ROMAN: Well, we were going to go to an air base, to an ATC base, and they were
all over the country. But the biggest ones were probably on the east coast.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit about getting the news that you were going
to Maine, how you felt about that?

ROMAN: I was thrilled. I was also thrilled that -- that’s where we met Lois
Benvenuti, Molly and I. So we became a threesome, and we were all sent to the
same place. In fact, we begged to be sent to the same place, and they were able
to fulfill our request.

FARRELL: What was it like leaving New York and going to Maine?

ROMAN: Exciting, because they flew us there. It was my first flight in a C-47, a
smaller plane. It was very exciting.

FARRELL: When you got to Maine, can you tell me a little bit more about what you
were doing and what the base was like?

ROMAN: Presque Isle was what we used to call potato country, russet potatoes,
Maine potatoes. The normal school where we were housed was just at the edge of a
huge acreage of farmland, potato farms. That’s all there was up there. We were
right at the Canadian border, as you probably know. We had a foreman, a black
American, John, and he was our father, our protector -- we were all quite young,
you know. I don’t think anybody was more than twenty-one years old. He had
worked at Pan Am, had a major job with Pan Am in the aircraft mechanics
division, and this is what he did during the war. So he was the foreman up
there. He’s the one we went to when we had any problems, he’s the one we
discussed sexism about just letting women wash parts. The town was very nice. It
was a small town, maybe fifteen blocks long, but it was lovely. They had diners
to eat in, we’d do that. The base was huge and it was very thrilling to be in
an aircraft base. The first time I saw it, I was just thrilled. I just loved it.
They also had an NCO club, noncommissioned officers’ club there, and we were
able to use it. Molly and I, who loved music due to my family’s influence, at
our lunch break would go to the NCO club with a sandwich and sit there and
listen to records, music. That’s all we did. We also had fun getting into the
planes when they were in the hangar, to examine the whole airplane. There were
C-rations there. C-rations were the boxes of food that they kept on the plane
that they also dropped down for military as well as people in any village, but
mostly it was for the military, it was food. Famously, dried eggs; it was kind
of disgusting. Cheese, everything was dried but we’d eat it just for fun, see
what it was like for the soldiers. We’d examine the plane quite thoroughly,
got to know the innards a little bit. Hangar 2 was where I was posted. And
upstairs, above the hangar, there was an office and a contingent of signalmen,
soldiers, Army soldiers. In those days, there was no distinction, there was no
Air Force, that came right after the war. There was the Army Air Force. It was
only maybe ’45 or ’46, I don’t remember when it became the United States
Air Force independently, as a fourth part of the military. So we had the Army,
the Army Air Force now, Marines, and the Navy. Before that we only had three,
until flying became such an important aspect of our lives. Did I veer away from
what we were talking about?

FARRELL: No, not at all. I’m curious, so the side story you were telling about
you weren’t given gloves and you had to wash parts in kerosene --

ROMAN: Yeah, our hands broke out.

FARRELL: -- that was in Maine.

ROMAN: Yeah, that was at the base, our working place.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about how you were able to organize
the other women that were working there?

ROMAN: Several of us had skin problems as a result of that, and the guys were
given the other jobs. The couple of guys that were there, even, three or four of
them. We just banded together and talked about it. We said, “We’ve got to do
something about this.” Just about three of us, Molly and myself, maybe Lois,
too, we spoke to John, and we said, “John, there has to be a change. We
can’t do this.” You know, women were much less outspoken in those days. I
think I was one of the nervy ones because of my upbringing, probably. I always
spoke up if I had -- not if I didn’t have to, but if I felt I had to. It’s
still that way today. Only if one has to. Keep it important. Yeah, we said,
“We can’t do that and we’re not going to. We’re not going to work unless
you put us on -- we had training at the academy to do all these other things and
we’re not being used that way.” It took a lot of nerve to do that in those
days. And he was kind of our rep in this. And they said, “Okay, we won’t be
doing that anymore.”

FARRELL: So it was a couple of days that you refused to work. Did that garner
any attention from any of the other officials?

ROMAN: No, I think it was quite private. They kept it quite private. They
realized that it was not fair. It didn’t turn into a big hullabaloo, it didn’t.

FARRELL: Did your relationship with John change after that?

ROMAN: No. John was our friend for a long time, even after the war. He lived in
Queens and went back to work for one of the big airlines. He’s gone now, of
course; he was older than we were.

FARRELL: Yes. You mentioned that there were only a few other men who were
working on the base, so it was mostly women that you were working with?

ROMAN: Yeah.

FARRELL: And you had also mentioned that the women and men had different jobs.
Can you tell me what -- do you remember what the difference in the jobs were?

ROMAN: No.

FARRELL: Okay.

ROMAN: Only what I’ve mentioned.

FARRELL: So it was a government subsidized program and you were getting paid. Do
you remember the wages?

ROMAN: I have no idea. Isn’t that funny? Those things weren’t important in
my memory anymore.

FARRELL: At that period of time, do you remember the type of housing that you
were living in?

ROMAN: Yes, of course. It was a dormitory, two in a room. It was, let’s see,
we took a bus from there, because that was, as I said, near the farm just at the
edge of town, that was the last block of town where the normal school was. There
was a teachers’ college there.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit more about -- well, I guess I’m sort of
interested in how -- you know, life had changed so drastically for you. You were
in high school and you were living with your parents, and then all of a sudden
you’re in Maine living in a dormitory, working. Just some of the -- I don’t
know if you remember some of how that felt or some of the differences.

ROMAN: I don’t have any memory of being sad about it, or “Mommy and Daddy,
I’d like to come back.” Nothing like that. I was eager to fly, I mean not
literally, but to fly on my own, so to speak. I felt it was so worthwhile. I
don’t want to sound phony patriotic, but I felt I was accomplishing something.
I was contributing something by doing this. This was the mentality of the day
for so many of us then. I was very interested in flying, and became more so
then. I had one break during the time we were there, and we decided to go to New
York, of course. We were able to hop a ride on a C-47 again, and then we were
let down because something happened to the plane, we were let down somewhere
around Boston and we took a train the rest of the way. That I do remember. And
then went back, of course. We had a few days off. That was another memory. Also,
we dated some of the soldiers, if that’s of interest.

FARRELL: Absolutely.

ROMAN: There was one hotel there where they had dinner and dancing, one little
hotel, and that was the place for dates. These were young guys, maybe two years
older than we were, in the Army being shipped over. So that was fun. One
marriage came out of that. Lois married John Adams.

FARRELL: Were there any other memorable soldiers that you remember from that time?

ROMAN: No, because I had kind of a boyfriend who was in the Army, who I later
married here in New York. We weren’t anything steady, but he was sort of in
the back of my mind, and I wasn’t too interested in people who I knew I would
never see again. I was a nerd. I didn’t know it then. [Laughs] I had lots of
fun, though, lots of dates.

FARRELL: So you were seeing somebody that was in the -- was he overseas?

ROMAN: Oh yes.

FARRELL: What was that like, having somebody in your life --

ROMAN: Well, we had a huge correspondence going. But I corresponded with a lot
of young fellows. I had a lot of boyfriends. When I was a teenager, there were
three fellows who were friends, and we became a foursome, safe. And I married
one of them, after the war, of course. I didn’t miss not being home. What I
think was remarkable, when I’ve told the story to others, was that my parents
were so wonderful. Who would let an eighteen- or a nineteen-year-old girl go off
by herself to do this, right? Not my parents -- I mean, they wouldn&#039;t object. My
father and mother encouraged me. It’s like, go for it, this is an opportunity
for you to learn about life. They never stopped me, and I’ve always
appreciated it -- I just took it for granted, I’ll tell you. I was very lucky,
I was kind of spoiled that way that I didn’t have to fight my way with my parents.

FARRELL: You got support, which is --

ROMAN: They were very, we used to use the word modern, and they were very
supportive. I was brought up with a sense of being a free soul, a free person.
My father, I remember my father taught me one important thing, sort of almost
cliché now. He said, “You can do anything you want, but you have to take
responsibility for whatever you do. And try to consider the consequences, and
then make your decision.” And that’s how I still live. Take risks if you
wish, but consider the consequences. And if you think it’s worth it, then you
do it.

FARRELL: Insightful. It’s a good lesson to carry with you, I’m sure.

ROMAN: Yeah, I taught my son the same thing.

FARRELL: So you did mention that you had the sense that you were doing
something, that there was patriotism.

ROMAN: Oh yes, oh yes.

FARRELL: Do you remember what the general feeling of the other women and men at
the base were? Was there a sense of patriotism there?

ROMAN: There was a strong sense of patriotism, especially being on the base and
seeing pilots and soldiers, you felt you were part of the war effort. Those were
the big two words: war effort. We were part of it. We were doing something. We
were contributing.

FARRELL: When you went into the ATC, you knew that you were contractually
obligated to commit until the war ended plus six months. What was that like for
you, committing an unknown amount of time?

ROMAN: I had nothing else to do. I had no obligations, I wasn’t going back to
school until it was all over.

FARRELL: And you had a sense that you knew it was temporary, but you were
committed to it as long as --

ROMAN: Yeah. Don’t forget, I was there the last year of the war. Things were
looking differently already.

FARRELL: Did you have a sense that the end of the war was coming? Could you feel that?

ROMAN: That the end was coming? No, not really. Not until May 6, when the
Germans capitulated. I believe it was May 6, 1945.

FARRELL: Can you tell me a little bit about learning that, and then your
memories of the end of the war?

ROMAN: Yeah. I was a little disappointed that we were shipped home so quickly
after the Japanese ended, because I liked the idea -- I liked the whole program.
I liked living with everyone, I liked the community feeling. I’ve always been
that way. I find it difficult to live alone, as I do now, of course. I still
find it difficult. I’ve always liked big community and being part of it.

FARRELL: There was also -- actually, you had mentioned, speaking of community,
you had mentioned Molly and Lois. Can you tell me about some of the friendships
that you formed there and what that meant to you?

ROMAN: Lois was the one we all became closest to. Soon after the war, we went
back to North Adams. She came from a big Italian family, a Massachusetts Italian
family. It was from her mother from whom I learned how to make the best marinara
sauce. I remember going there, getting there at night, late, rather. She went
into her freezer, she had a freezer then, taking out some sauce, defrosting it,
boiling up a pot of pasta. Oh, it was so wonderful. And we were always welcome
there. Lois and Molly and I were the three. There were other friends, of course,
but not on that intimate friendship level. We sort of lost touch. But the three
of us kept in touch through most of our lives, as Lois and I are still in touch.

FARRELL: Before we get to sort of the end of the war, did your job and your
role, did that change over time? I mean, I know that you had organized the
strike, so you got gloves, but were you doing different jobs?

ROMAN: On the base, you mean? Yeah. We started doing the regular work that we
were trained for. That is, working on the engines, preparing the engines for the
next flight.

FARRELL: So that just -- it all came to --

ROMAN: I don’t ever remember having to go into the kerosene tub again.

FARRELL: So you also had, in a bio that you wrote, you had talked about some of
your memories of shortly after V-E Day. Can you tell me a little bit about what
you remember of people arriving back at the base?

ROMAN: That was the very most exciting incident that I remember. We were at the
field and suddenly there was a roar of B-25s, and they started flying in and
landing on the base. B-24s, excuse me, there is a difference. The B-24s. And we
saw them coming in, and as the pilots got out of the plane, we ran out, just ran
out to the field and embraced every one of them. These were people who’d come
back from the war zones. They shipped them back so quickly, within days they
were coming back to the U.S. That’s a picture that’ll always be in my mind,
all the women running out and embracing the first guys we saw. Almost like that
kissing picture in Times Square, come to think of it. [Laughs] That famous one,
you know?

FARRELL: After that, were there a lot of other soldiers that were coming back
from overseas? Did you encounter a lot of that?

ROMAN: Not too much. It’s that first day, the first group that came over, the
B-24s that landed.

FARRELL: Did they stay at the base after they arrived?

ROMAN: I have no idea. I have no idea whether they stayed at the base or if then
they were rerouted. I have no idea how the Army did that.

FARRELL: So the war had ended, but you still had -- did you stay there for the
full six months after?

ROMAN: No. There was no need. We were disbanded, let go, very quickly.

FARRELL: Do you remember what the time period was?

ROMAN: It was late August, maybe early September of ’45. I got home, and it
was over. Had to look for a job. But first, I remember a few days after I came
home, I came back to our apartment -- I was living with my parents, of course --
and there’s an Army cap there, just one of those caps, and that meant that my
to-be first husband had arrived back from Europe also. He was in Germany -- he
was in military in Germany. He’s one of those college boys that got pulled
into the Army. He was at Rutgers at the time, and then was drafted.

FARRELL: What was that like?

ROMAN: Exciting. He was the first one back, of the three guys that I’d sent
off, literally. They all came back, thank goodness, and went on to marry and
live long lives.

FARRELL: Did you have conversations with him when he came home about what his
experiences were like?

ROMAN: Oh sure, sure. He was in Germany and was at that famous Battle of the
Bulge. He was military police, that’s what he did. Along that road in Germany,
I forget what specific place, one of our friends was in the engineering corps,
and all these trucks and cars were coming by and he was directing traffic, and
coincidentally one of our friends, one of the engineering group, drove by both
our friend. Isn’t that weird? It was chilling, you know? Battle of the Bulge.

FARRELL: When you came back, how did you see New York changing, or had it
changed after the war?

ROMAN: Well, there was a great spirit of joy, of happiness and future and plans
to be made. And of course those who had been in the service were applying for
universities, the G.I. Bill was in place. In fact, that’s how my first husband
was able to finish college, and then go to law school. I didn’t quite know
what to do. We didn’t have any money, so I needed to have a job, but I applied
for NYU, English major, and worked and went to school at the same time. My
father had said, “I have no money. You have to do it yourself.” INo one has
ever supported me. I’ve always contributed equally to any partnership.

FARRELL: You also had mentioned that you had this real interest in aeronautics.
Can you tell me a little bit more about how that developed, and then after the
war how that evolved?

ROMAN: I would say the only reason I didn’t follow through on that was that we
were living in a time when there was no room for women. It wasn’t even an
option. Of course I could’ve done it. I don’t know why I didn’t. I have a
good engineering skills. But I guess I was influenced and went along with the
time. I think my intellectual development was in flux and I didn’t know what I
wanted to do. I wanted to learn more, I wanted to read a lot, as I did. I was
also a literature minor. That’s how I got involved in the publishing field. I
was very interested in writing and so on. Not as a writer myself, just as a
critic, I am still today. [Laughs] I don’t have too many regrets, because I
do, as I said, take responsibility for what I do. But I do have a regret that I
didn’t ever follow through and do something in aeronautics, because I loved
it. I just kept up with what was happening in aviation. The great coincidence,
as I mentioned earlier on, was my third and last husband. When I found out he
was a pilot and we spoke the same language, it brought us together. For him, I
was a woman who could understand his language. He was an inventor, innovative
and brilliant. I was his mechanical helper. We were in the field very often
working on his newest parachutes. So that’s where, forty years later, I was
able to use the skills I’d actually started with. It was wonderful for both of
us. I did what I loved, I could do it, and he loved having a partner like me.

FARRELL: Did you find that after the war ended, that the workforce had changed?

ROMAN: Oh yes, women -- well, you know what happened in the fifties right after
the war. You know that history. We went right back to where we were.

FARRELL: Did you find it, because you had that experience working, was it easier
for you to find a job after NYU? Did that help?

ROMAN: Yeah, because I felt sure of myself. I’ve always felt capable, because
I’ve -- I never had a problem feeling capable. And of course that experience
in Presque Isle fortified that feeling. I’ve never been shy about going to
interviews or facing men, which in my time was quite something. Yeah, I think
the whole experience certainly made me a stronger woman.

FARRELL: Aside from making a stronger woman, what are some of the big lessons
that you learned from your time working for the ATC?

ROMAN: Getting along with people. Working side-by-side with people. Cooperating.
It sounds so cliché, but it’s true. Not being afraid to venture out and do
something new, certainly. I think that was a big influence, that whole
experience, doing something different, or being different. Not many women went
out for this. There must have been many, several, because we filled the job.
There were just no men there to do this. Either they were rejects from the Army
and they did something else. I do remember one young man, and I know now, I knew
later, that he was gay, and this was what he wanted to do. Or maybe he wasn’t
accepted into the service because of that. We don’t know that, so long ago.
Could be any of those things.

FARRELL: What are some of the things that you hope people remember about that
period of time?

ROMAN: I enjoyed it. And it made me grow, in knowledge, not necessarily just
about aeronautics, but of course it did that. It fortified whatever I knew about
how things work, mechanical things. And it taught me not to be afraid of flying.
I used to say to people who were afraid of flying, “Why don’t you read
something about it, because if you know how it works, you won’t be afraid.”
That’s my theory, anyway. I made it all up. [Laughs] B Fear of flying,
everybody&#039;s afraid of flying.

FARRELL: Is there anything else that you want to add or talk about?

ROMAN: I tell you, if I had not had the experience that I had with the ATC,
I’m not sure that my last and happiest marriage would have succeeded. Because
in some curious way, it brought David T. Barash and Johanna Roman together. It
joined us, that we had that passion, we shared it.

FARRELL: Well, that’s great. Thank you so much.

ROMAN: I hope it was useful.

FARRELL: It was great, yeah. Thank you.

ROMAN: [Break in audio] I’ve always wanted to take flying lessons. Somehow I
didn&#039;t have the impetus to do it, but being with a flyer, with a pilot, and he
flew every kind of airplane, it just gave me the push to do it. We used to go
upstate in order to have space to practice on the newest paraglider, the newest
invention, and there was a little airport nearby, and I took flying lessons
there. And I went to flying school, because you have to have ground school as
well. I stopped after about ten hours -- it’s an expensive hobby. I flew in a
Piper Cub, by the way. I like small planes, the worst kind, they’re dangerous,
of course. I stopped after about ten hours, which is a lot for flying lessons,
because I realized that it was a great financial investment, I was already in my
sixties. I thought, where am I going with this? Do I really want to do a
cross-country solo flight? And how many times am I going to rent a plane to fly?
So I got enough out of it and satisfied my need.

FARRELL: Sated that desire to fly.

ROMAN: So I put a couple of hours in, and that was that.
