REDMAN: Today is April 3, 2012 and I&#039;m delighted to be in Oakland, California
sitting down with K. Patricia Cross. Today Pat Cross resides in Oakland and is
Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. But we&#039;ll be
talking about her life a bit earlier, before she went back to college and then
on to graduate school. We&#039;ll be talking about her life during World War II. Pat,
let&#039;s begin with the basics, if we could. Would you state and spell your name?

CROSS: My name is K, the initial, Patricia Cross. K P-A-T-R-I-C-I-A C-R-O-S-S.

REDMAN: Great. And you go by Pat Cross?

CROSS: I go by Pat.

REDMAN: Would you mind telling me when and where you were born?

CROSS: I was born on Saint Patrick&#039;s Day; it&#039;s the reason for Pat. In 1926 in
Normal, Illinois.

REDMAN: Will you tell me a little bit about what Normal, Illinois was like
growing up very early on?

CROSS: Well, in the first place, I was born in Normal, Illinois, lived on Normal
Avenue, and attended Illinois State Normal University. It was a very normal town
of about 7,000, dominated by a teacher&#039;s college, which was ISNU, Illinois State
Normal University, at that time. It was about 3,000 students. Normal was a
typical small university town. I just want to add now it is over 50,000, home to
a major university, Illinois State University, and so it&#039;s a very different town.

REDMAN: So it&#039;s grown significantly since that time.

CROSS: It has grown and changed, and industry has come in. There was really no
industry except the university and the education. And, of course, everybody more
or less was in the same curriculum. That is, we were all planning to be
teachers. And my father was a physics professor at the University. And I went to
what were called the training schools at that time. They were demonstration
schools where the students from the college could practice on the kids in the
grade school. I went to the Thomas Metcalf Training School, which was on campus,
and we had so-called practice teachers.

REDMAN: Now, I&#039;d like to get back to that in just a moment. But first can I ask
about your parents? You&#039;ve mentioned your father was a physics professor.

CROSS: Yes.

REDMAN: For the record, would you mind sharing a little bit about your mother?
Who is--?

CROSS: Both my parents came from Kansas, and my mother had a kind of business
college education. And in that time, of course, women were at home raising
children. She was very musically talented but mostly for her own use. She sang
around the house, she played piano, she made sure all of us had music lessons. I
played the violin, my sister played the piano, and my brother the clarinet.

REDMAN: A very musical family.

CROSS: That was the music part of the family. We were in walking distance of the
University. And at least in the early years we took in roomers. They were
students from the University. Had a room and they had a kind of--I guess you&#039;d
call it, you know, a little stove down in the basement and a little refrigerator
where they could do what was called &quot;light housekeeping.&quot; And they were handy
&quot;baby sitters.&quot;

REDMAN: I understand that the University of Chicago--maybe about this time,
maybe a little bit earlier--and some scholars, like James Dewey, and some other
scholars there, were innovating in terms of elementary education, in particular,
but in terms of--they created a similar sort of practice, like a lab school on
the campus. I assume Illinois State was sort of mimicking--

CROSS: That is exactly what this was. It was a lab school. It wasn&#039;t called
that. And it would be called a private school today, although anybody from the
community was welcome. There were a lot of faculty kids there. I mean, faculty
kids automatically went there. And then eight grades of grade school were
followed by the University High School. That&#039;s what it was called. U High. And
U-High had students. We did the usual things. But, again, the classrooms were
largely run by practice teachers. That is, we had a critic teacher, and then we
usually had two students who were practicing on us to teach high school in the
schools of Illinois.

REDMAN: So tell me about, from the perspective of an elementary school-aged
girl, what that experience was like for you and then in the context, too,
presumably of the Great Depression. I assume that your family or these students
weren&#039;t shielded from the Great Depression. Can you talk about that a little bit?

CROSS: Well, I think I was only vaguely aware of the Depression. My father had a
secure position. It was minimal salary, and my mother was the greatest economist
I&#039;ve ever known. She looked at everything; she shopped where she got the best
bargains. And the other thing that was very important about my childhood, my
father was a diabetic. He discovered he had diabetes just two years after
insulin was discovered. Otherwise he would not have lived, but they discovered
insulin. Therefore, my mother became a nutritionist, and at that time the only
way to control diabetics was through insulin and very careful diet. And so she
knew the value of every kind of food, and she read and she studied. My father
really lived a very healthy life under her supervision of diet. So it was a very
healthy family situation, yes.

REDMAN: And maybe can you talk a little bit about housing. What your housing was
like in Normal in those days.

CROSS: Well, it was practically all owned and taken care of by the owners. I
don&#039;t remember that we ever even had a plumber from outside. My father did
plumbing, gardening, anything electrical. Of course, he was a physicist, so he
knew something about some of those things. But most all people on Normal Avenue,
heavily professors, did their own work. The only people I can remember coming to
the house were the milkman--it was delivered by truck daily--and the iceman
because there were not electric refrigerators. He brought the big chunks of ice
into the back and put it in the--

REDMAN: How long might that last you in the icebox? A big chunk of ice that the
iceman would have brought you. Would that last a week?

CROSS: I can&#039;t remember how long it would have lasted. I remember the kids all
went out and followed the ice truck to get little chunks of ice. That was a big
treat. I think he came daily. I wouldn&#039;t swear to that. But yes, he brought
those very large chunks. He walked around to the back and put it directly in the
icebox, which opened to the outside.

REDMAN: How about religion? Were your parents religious at all?

CROSS: No. More like academic communities. Although we had quite a strong group
of Unitarians who went to the Unitarian church from which the Adlai Stevenson
came. He was a Bloomington boy, and the Stevensons were pillars of the Unitarian
church in Bloomington. So we kind of went off and on, you know, on Easter. That
kind of thing. But I think both of my parents--my mother had grown up as a
Presbyterian but she didn&#039;t pay a whole lot of attention to it either, so we
weren&#039;t really--we went occasionally as a family or sometimes I went with my
friend who was a very good Baptist, and I went to the Baptist church.

REDMAN: Would you mind talking about the other kids? You said that many of the
students at the lab school or the school in Normal, Illinois that you were
attending were other children of faculty.

CROSS: Yes.

REDMAN: Can you talk about what they were like?

CROSS: Well, let me divert just a little bit to say by the time we got to high
school it was half faculty kids and half students from the Illinois Soldiers and
Sailors Children&#039;s School, which was primarily the orphan children of World War
I. They had set up a very large what we called the orphanage then. And so many
of the students in the high school were from that segment of society. They were
either orphans of World War I soldiers or for some reason under the care of the
state. And then we had this other group, which were the faculty kids.

REDMAN: That must have made for a very interesting practice environment for
these young educators.

CROSS: It was. Well, we just didn&#039;t mix. The kids from the orphans&#039; home, as we
called it, were the athletes. And the kids from the faculty were the bookies.

REDMAN: [laughs] Different groups of students.

CROSS: Great socio-economic differences, yes.

REDMAN: Right. Great socio-economic differences. Did you find that that was an
eye-opening experience for you as a young girl?

CROSS: Not necessarily. We just accepted them for kind of who they were. There
wasn&#039;t any great talk about discriminating or anything of that sort. They were
just there, and we were there. Nobody thought we should necessarily include them
in our parties or anything. It was just--no one talked about it. But neither was
it any kind of pressure or any kind of discomfort connected with it. They came
and went by bus on regular hours, so except for special events--football games--
they were not around after school.

REDMAN: Did people talk about the Great Depression in terms of so-and-so&#039;s
father having work or so-and-so&#039;s father not having work?

CROSS: I don&#039;t remember any talk of that but, of course, mostly it was faculty
who had work but who were economizing in the general flavor of the country, I
guess, yes. And, of course, my parents both came from kind of godforsaken farms
in Kansas, so they were--their families, I think, suffered a little bit but they
were such large families that we didn&#039;t have much contact with them either.

REDMAN: Did your parents have any particular thoughts--did they ever talk about
Herbert Hoover? I&#039;ll ask about FDR in a moment. But who I suspect for most
people of your generation--

CROSS: Well, all I really remember is they were very staunch enthusiasts about
FDR. What era was he any--

REDMAN: So he comes in in &#039;33. So you&#039;re born in &#039;26. So when you&#039;re about seven
years old he would have been inaugurated.

CROSS: Yes, yes. So I remember that they were strongly in favor of FDR but I
don&#039;t remember it being dinner-table conversation or anything.

REDMAN: Soon after he&#039;s inaugurated he starts doing something called Fireside
Chats over the radio.

CROSS: I remember. And my mother was very enthusiastic about Fireside Chats, and
I do remember them listening to that. I don&#039;t remember my listening to it or
having any particular impression.

REDMAN: But she talked about listening to it, or you remember her listening?

CROSS: Well, I remember her listening to it. Yes. And both my parents were
pretty avid radio--news on the radio was what they got and, of course, the
comedians of the time, I guess. But they followed news quite carefully.

REDMAN: [Brief pause to fix audio] Pat, when we left off we were talking about
listening to the radio at home, and I was wondering if maybe there were any
other programs you might be able to recall.

CROSS: Well, wasn&#039;t Charlie McCarthy on at that time?

REDMAN: Okay, yes. And Amos &#039;n&#039; Andy, a lot of people talk about.

CROSS: Amos &#039;n&#039; Andy. Sunday evening, as I remember, were kind of the comedy
programs. And some of the music programs. Now I can&#039;t remember what they were.

REDMAN: Things like Grand Ole Opry or things--

CROSS: My mother actually had books on opera. She was never an opera singer, but
she was very interested in opera and so--but I don&#039;t remember us listening to opera.

REDMAN: How about reading the newspaper? Did your parents get newspapers?

CROSS: Oh, yes.

REDMAN: Would they get multiple newspapers? Was that the type of news--?

CROSS: No, the Daily Pantagraph from Bloomington. And my very best friend was
the daughter of the owner of the Pantagraph. And several of the students at
University High School came from the parents who worked at the Daily Pantagraph.
So the Pantagraph really dominated the scene. I don&#039;t know that people took, or
at least they didn&#039;t talk about the Chicago Tribune or anything like that.
Everything was in the Pantagraph.

REDMAN: So I&#039;m from the Midwest and people will tell me these old stories about
being able to tune into the radio and you could listen to St. Louis or Chicago
or Pittsburgh or something. That they would boost the signal at night of these
different--so you might be able to hear the radio--

CROSS: I don&#039;t remember that. My father, of course, remember, built radios. He
built some of our first kind of radio things because it was of general interest
to physicists. And anyway, he was very much interested in sound systems. He, for
instance, was responsible for the sound systems at college graduation. He and
his students were climbing trees around the outdoor graduation grounds to put in
the loudspeakers and so forth. So he really handled sound. He also ran the
university movies. The university put on free movies every Friday night, and my
father was responsible for ordering the movies, getting the students to run
them. I ran the machines for a while. So it was small town life really at its best.

REDMAN: Even as a young girl, did you start to get a little bit of a sense of
what faculty life was like for--?

CROSS: I don&#039;t think I distinguished it from anything else. My friends, for
instance, were not by and large faculty friends. The friends I had who were
faculty were children of my parents&#039; friends. My friends were more likely to be
neighbors. Which were often faculty but sometimes not. My best friend was the
daughter of a--he rapidly became a millionaire in Normal, Illinois, over
inventing hybrid seed corn. Stiegelmeier hybrid seed corn. They lived in a very
modest house, and the money just poured in for hybrid seed corn. They had much
more money than I did, but I don&#039;t think any of us ever thought anything of it.
I was simply unaware of it.

REDMAN: Was there racial segregation to an extent that you were able to notice
as a university--?

CROSS: Yes. There was a little section of town where the black students came
from. And there was a black student, her name was Jackie White, and she was in
my brother&#039;s class. And Sherma Dabney. It&#039;s interesting that I can remember
those names, not the names of the people on the floor here. And they were quite
accepted. We never thought anything one way or another about them. The boys were
quite frequently athletic stars.

REDMAN: I wanted to ask about boys and girls, how they got along in those days.

CROSS: Well, let me see. Some of my good friends were boys. They tended to be
neighborhood boys. There was no talk in those days about sex, nor was anybody
doing any experimenting, or at least not that I was aware of. They were just
friends like my girlfriends were friends.

REDMAN: How about sex ed in school? Was that something that was taught or was
that a subject that was completely--?

CROSS: That was a subject that never even came up to my knowledge. I don&#039;t
remember anything. I don&#039;t even remember having a sex talk with my parents.

REDMAN: So it&#039;s sort of find out on your own, good luck.

CROSS: I don&#039;t know. And I didn&#039;t feel any particular need to bring it up. There
didn&#039;t seem to be any little clusters of students that I knew that were
interested in it. So just completely naïve.

REDMAN: I imagine that for a lot of people, when the war came, and then they
moved to big cities or they were drafted into the military, that would have been
quite a shock in that--

CROSS: It might have been. Yes, it might have been quite different, yes.

REDMAN: Well, let&#039;s talk for a moment, if we could, about some activities that
people would have done in high school. Actually, this is a pretty good segue.
What about dating?

CROSS: Well, we dated. You really needed a date for the high school prom.

REDMAN: Can you talk about prom?

CROSS: The prom was once a year. It was the senior prom, and you were supposed
to have a date. I didn&#039;t have a date, so my good friend had to get me a date not
from our school who took me to the prom because I didn&#039;t have a boyfriend. She
was fairly well connected with a boy, a boyfriend. But I don&#039;t think sex was
part of it at all. It wasn&#039;t much talked about. I wasn&#039;t much aware of it. I
don&#039;t think there were girls who were known as &quot;date bait.&quot; Although there were
girls who were more interested in boys. And I say girls because I don&#039;t think it
went the other way necessarily. We didn&#039;t have boys who chased after girls, or
at least not after me! We had some girls who were very interested in boys. Well,
I guess some of my friends were pretty good date bait now that I think about it.

REDMAN: Of course, it seems like the idea of homosexuality in Normal, Illinois
in those days would have been something that would have been far less discussed
than, say, today. But I wonder if there was ever a thought of a gay boy or a gay
girl or anything like that?

CROSS: No, I think in those days we might have called them &quot;sissies.&quot; But there
wasn&#039;t a sexual implication. It was just that they weren&#039;t athletic and they did
girlish things. But I don&#039;t think it had any other connotation.

REDMAN: They didn&#039;t fit the masculine--

CROSS: They didn&#039;t fit the masculine [images of the time]. And my brother wasn&#039;t
a sissy, but he was kind of an isolate, a social isolate. But he didn&#039;t have
either the athletic or the sissy title. He was just not very sociable.

REDMAN: Were you pretty successful in school as a young child?

CROSS: Yes. I was successful both as a--I was popular. I was president of my
senior class. I think one of the few girls that was president of her class. And
I was in the honor society and I was the salutatorian. My sister was really the
brilliant student. She was valedictorian for her class, and she was the better
student. But I was a very good student. I made good grades all the way through.
But I would say mostly As with a few Bs sprinkled around.

REDMAN: And what year did you graduate from high school? Do you recall?

CROSS: Oh, I guess it would have been--let&#039;s see, seventeen and 1926. About 1943.

REDMAN: So the war had already come around by the time you graduated from high school.

CROSS: Yes.

REDMAN: First of all, what might you have worn to prom? Do you recall what young
girls would wear to prom in those days?

CROSS: Oh, yes. My mother slaved long and hard over my dress. It was a long
dress, and it was an organdy kind of thing. Very dressy. I loved the dress, but
it was the only time I ever wore it, I think. But yes. And everybody got a
corsage, and the boys called for the girls. They had a car, and they bought
either wrist corsage or--I think in those days it was more likely to be quite
frequently an orchid, something like that. That was the prized corsage.

REDMAN: I want to ask a question. About food. Is there anything related to
eating or food that are any particularly strong memories? Was your mother a cook
or anything like that?

CROSS: She was a cook. She was a nutritionist and a dietician.

REDMAN: So she paid very careful attention.

CROSS: And she was very careful. We had a huge garden, and we had very strange
things in it. Anything that was new, my mother jumped on with enthusiasm. So we
raised edible soybeans, and we raised artichokes and parsnips and all sorts of
strange things. We canned up to seventy quarts of tomatoes a year.

REDMAN: Tell me about canning.

CROSS: We did a lot of canning. Particularly because my father&#039;s diet was
heavily on vegetables.

REDMAN: So you would harvest these vegetables from your garden?

CROSS: Yes. He would grow them, and we were always growing the very latest. They
were just absolutely wonderful. We had the best tomatoes anywhere. We could can
seventy quarts from our own garden--

REDMAN: So then you&#039;d be able to preserve those.

CROSS: Well, a lot of my summers were spent in the kitchen skinning those darn
tomatoes. Dropping them in boiling water, peeling off the skins. I have vivid
memories of that. And shelling peas on the front porch. Yes, our garden was
extremely important. We had rhubarb, we had fruit trees, and we had cherries.

REDMAN: So it seems like a lot of the family activity may have taken place
around the activity of harvesting the garden and canning and preparing the vegetables?

CROSS: Yes. I didn&#039;t think of it as a farm family, but now that you mention it,
it certainly was around the garden, outdoors. Both of my parents loved the
garden. They worked in it, and they had the excitement of ordering the new seeds
or getting the new plants. Maybe both coming from farms helped.

REDMAN: Your dad, would you describe your dad as an intellectual?

CROSS: I think these days he would have been really heavily into electronics. He
loved how things worked. He wasn&#039;t necessarily an intellectual then, but he ran
practically everything around the campus that had to do with any kind of new
technology. And at that time there were a lot of new things. Even the movie theater.

REDMAN: You talked about building his own radios and things like that?

CROSS: Yes. He really introduced free movies at the University. And he hired
students to run the movies. And it usually filled the auditorium every Friday afternoon.

REDMAN: So they were quite popular.

CROSS: It was quite popular, yes.

REDMAN: In the late thirties, I&#039;ll say [1941], the US and Britain enter an
agreement called Lend-Lease, where we start building ships and airplanes and
things like that for Britain.

CROSS: I was aware of it but not in any way that impacted directly on me and
anything that I thought about. I suppose I might have read about it. I don&#039;t know.

REDMAN: Then in December of 1941, when you maybe would have been a sophomore or
junior in high school, when Pearl Harbor happens, Pearl Harbor was attacked.

CROSS: Yes, I probably was in high school. I don&#039;t have any really clear
recollection of it at all. I think as enthusiastic as both of my parents were
about keeping in touch with things, both by newspaper and by radio, we were
certainly aware of it, and we certainly must have talked about it around the
dinner table. But I don&#039;t have any vivid experiences.

REDMAN: How old were your brothers?

CROSS: My brother was two years older; my sister two years younger. So I was the middle.

REDMAN: Were you concerned at all? Do you remember being concerned for your
brother or do you remember--?

CROSS: Yes. My brother went into the service. Actually my parents thought it
would be a good thing for him to get in the service and get some discipline. He
was kind of a difficult boy. And so it wasn&#039;t viewed with alarm. Nor was it
viewed as a hero protecting our country. The draft was in full flower, and most
men volunteered or were drafted.

REDMAN: The war came on right as he would have been graduating, I suspect.

CROSS: Barton, my brother, would have been just graduating from high school. I
guess he enlisted prior to being drafted. I&#039;m not sure. At any rate, he pulled
off some very wonderful jobs in the military. He got a job, I remember, on
Mobile Bay where he just took a boat and sailed it around. He was in the Army,
just a draftee, a buck private. But he got this wonderful, kind of isolationist
job. He had his own boat. Drove it around the Bay. I don&#039;t know whether this was
supposed to be security or what.

REDMAN: So that&#039;s it for him.

CROSS: Sent us wonderful pictures. And he was kind of a technician like my
father. He was very bright.

REDMAN: So did he end up staying in the US during the war?

CROSS: Yes, he was stateside all the time.

REDMAN: Was he on the West Coast by--or do you know where was he stationed?

CROSS: He was stationed mostly in the South, Alabama, I think. And he seemed to
stay fairly close to that. I don&#039;t think he moved around a lot. And somehow or
other I don&#039;t think he was ever threatened with going overseas.

REDMAN: There&#039;s a funny story from the Civil War about a guy who was stationed
in Florida for all four years of the war watching an intersection. I think that
that happens on occasion.

But let&#039;s get back to your story. We talked about Pearl Harbor. I&#039;m wondering if
you have any sort of recollections about Germany and the Nazi Party or Hitler as
being a threat and the Japanese as being an enemy.

CROSS: Yes. My real experience with the war came much later, after I came back.
I don&#039;t remember much as a high school kid, but by the time I was in graduate
school, when all of the servicemen were coming back, those were the more vivid
experiences. During my undergraduate years at ISNU most of the men on campus
were enlisted in an officer-training program, Navy V-12. They were rigidly
supervised with the closing hours usually associated with &quot;women&#039;s hours.&quot; So it
was a complete reversal of roles. The Navy had taken over the women&#039;s dorms, and
most of the women were in rooming houses on their own. I remember that as
students we used to walk the men to their dorm because they had closing hours.
Some ridiculous closing hours, like 7:00 o&#039;clock in the evening. We&#039;d walk the
men to the dorms, and then we&#039;d go home.

REDMAN: When you finished high school--it&#039;s about &#039;43--and you are faced with
your campus, sort of your home campus of Illinois State, you know, not being a
college campus.

CROSS: Yes, I&#039;m a little ahead of myself, because after I finished high school I
took one year of college at INSU. I enrolled as a freshman at Illinois State,
planning to be a teacher, albeit not very enthusiastic about that as a future.
Somehow I got a description of an interesting wartime program for women
students. It was a six-month training program for &quot;radar engineer aides,&quot;
conducted at the University of Minnesota. After training we would go to Wright
Field in Dayton, Ohio and work in various technical jobs for the war effort. We
were not in the military; the program was civil service.

It was exciting for me because it was the first time I had really been on my
own. I took the train by myself from Bloomington, Illinois to Chicago to
Minneapolis, where I made my way somehow to the dorms and met with thirty other
women. Maybe thirty or forty of us. And we were the entering class. I think I
was probably the youngest. I was probably eighteen. My roommate was twenty-seven
and she had a master&#039;s degree in physics, I think, or one of the sciences. And
so the group ranged in age but they were closer to my age. They were college
kids, really, and they were college girls who had an interest in science, which
by itself was a little bit unusual--in those times. We lived in the college
dorms. We went to class at the Electrical Engineering School of the University
of Minnesota.

And they were all kind of like I was. They came from protected homes. They were
all very bright. They were interested in science. The courses were taught to us
alone. We weren&#039;t just integrated into university classes, and we had our own
section of the dormitory. But we really lived very much like college students.

REDMAN: To what extent--there being other young women who were interested in
science and also women with this sort of varied spectrum, say, for instance,
your roommate that already had a master&#039;s degree in science--did that encourage
your own interest in engineering and math and science?

CROSS: Didn&#039;t seem to be anything special. We didn&#039;t think anything of it. We
must have been selected on some kind of criteria. But I don&#039;t remember that we
thought we were anything particularly special. We were in this program, and the
idea was we&#039;d go for six months of training and then we would go perform our
duties. And a lot of the girls were there for the same reason I was. Campuses
weren&#039;t very exciting. The men were all gone. There was a break in the kind of
social fabric of the society. We were mostly away from home. A few of the girls,
like my roommate, happened to be older. Most of them were roughly my age. They
were college kids, really.

REDMAN: Can you talk about your professors there?

CROSS: They were the regular staff of the Electrical Engineering School. And I
don&#039;t remember that we were a particular shock to them or privilege or anything.
It just seemed like it was very much like our college classes. Very much.

REDMAN: So you don&#039;t get the impression that they were surprised at having young
female students, for instance? Many of their students, I&#039;m sure, predominantly
are men.

CROSS: We didn&#039;t even feel very special, I don&#039;t think, or at least I didn&#039;t.
Well, and remember, it was the war years. There weren&#039;t a lot of men around, so
they were probably very grateful to have us. [laughs] And none of us were dating
men there. So we must have been rather segregated from the men, but there
weren&#039;t many men on campus anyway, except for the carefully regulated military
education programs like the Navy V-12.

REDMAN: Regarding social life during those six months, were you predominantly
studying, or were you able to explore the campus?

CROSS: We were predominantly studying. We didn&#039;t even travel around much. I
think we went to St. Paul maybe. We did the kind of things college girls would
do and we basically considered ourselves college kids. It wasn&#039;t that much
different from when I was a freshman, except that we had a busy and greatly
regulated program.

REDMAN: When these young women went into this program, was there a pipeline for
a job at the end of it?

CROSS: Oh, yes. The understanding was we then owed them after they trained us.
We took all required courses and they were mostly--I guess they didn&#039;t differ a
great deal from my physics courses and math courses in college except that they
had more technology to them.

REDMAN: That&#039;s a subtle point that I suspect is pretty important. Were there
more practical applications with--?

CROSS: It was practical. My assignment when I got to Wright Field was to measure
the transmission through radomes. So there was obviously equipment involved in
it. And we were trained primarily in that. But most of our Minnesota cohort went
to very diverse jobs at Wright Field.

REDMAN: I understand that there was another program called the Curtiss-Wright
Cadets Program, that it was also on the University of Minnesota at the time.
There would have been a group of young women even wearing uniforms. The
Curtiss-Wright cadets.

CROSS: Yes.

REDMAN: They had to go to Curtiss-Wright plants. This sounds like there were
multiple plants or places--

CROSS: No, our particular group all went to Wright Field. We didn&#039;t wear
uniforms or anything. Nor did we have any identifying marks or caps or anything
else. But the commitment was they were training us for jobs at Wright Field. We
were civil service, just like any other civilian worker at Wright Field.

REDMAN: What was your reaction to the University of Minnesota campus?

CROSS: Oh, I loved it. Because it was something I had kind of hoped for but I
was kind of stuck in Normal, Illinois in a teacher&#039;s college. And here I was in
electrical engineering at the University of Minnesota. That was wonderful. And I
think my parents thought it was wonderful.

REDMAN: So they were very supportive of this?

CROSS: They were very supportive. Particularly my mother; she was something of
an adventurer. And she thought the more interesting things we did, the better.
She wasn&#039;t pushing us to get married or date or anything like that. She wanted
us to do interesting things.

REDMAN: Was that part of her reason of being so supportive of your brother
enlisting do you think?

CROSS: Probably. Yes.

REDMAN: Is there anything else that you&#039;d like to add about the University of
Minnesota training program, that six months there?

CROSS: Well, let me see. It was a very rich experience, and I made very good
friends. To this day we exchange Christmas cards. So that would have been, what,
seventy years of exchange? Well, sixty years of exchanging Christmas cards. And
we were really a very good group. As I remember, there weren&#039;t little pockets of
people off here and there. Everybody kind of--we all had our individual friends.
I look at the photographs in that book, and I&#039;m consistently with eight people
who are about my age. And I think there were an older group but I don&#039;t remember
doing much with them.

REDMAN: Sure. It was a pretty normal--

CROSS: It seemed to me perfectly normal. I loved being in a dorm, eating in the
cafeteria, all of those college things that I think I felt kind of denied in my
having to go to the teachers&#039; college and live at home.

REDMAN: When you first arrive at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, what that
experience is then like. Did you sign up for the job and work? Was there sort of
a first day?

CROSS: I think that the various offices at Wright Field probably had some choice
of who they took. I was assigned to--I can remember his name. Captain Fred
Barrons. And he was a captain in the Air Corps.

REDMAN: Sure. Army Air Corps.

CROSS: Right, yes. Wright Field was--. Anyway, he was our boss, and I think he
had a master&#039;s degree, probably in physics or math or some science. I was the
only one from our group assigned to that particular unit. And others were
assigned other places.

Three of us rented an apartment in Dayton. At this point we were pretty much on
our own. We rented an apartment, and we made arrangements for--they had a car
pool that picked me up. But my friends worked elsewhere at Wright Field. I was
one of the very few who was assigned to what was called the &quot;flight line.&quot; I was
in the hangar. We measured the transmission of radar through a--at that time
they had a huge dome that was on the belly of the airplane, and the antennae
stuck out in that dome. Our task was to measure the transmission of the radar
through that material of the dome. I&#039;m still kind of amazed. Remember, by this
time I&#039;m eighteen or nineteen. I have a group of what was then known as &quot;Section
Eight.&quot; Section Eight were disabled through war service or--I don&#039;t think
anybody considered them in any way dangerous or anything. But part of my task
was I had three or four of these guys to supervise. And we got along fine. [laughs]

REDMAN: As a twenty-year-old young woman, that seems like a big responsibility.

CROSS: Yes, yes, yes. And there weren&#039;t any advances or anything that I
remember, any uncomfortable situations. I was pretty much in charge. They did
some of the heavy work. I measured. I have a very vague recollection of what I
actually did.

REDMAN: So were you testing the materials that they would put to protect the radar?

CROSS: Yes. And all I did was really take readings and turn in the reports. I
gave them to Captain Barrons, and he had his crew, and he presumably as a
scientist himself knew what to do with them. But I remember I dated very heavily
for the first time in my life in Dayton, Ohio. A guy who I certainly think my
mother would not have approved. And I think all of the girls dated off and on.
But they were usually guys from the field. I don&#039;t remember any incidents or
anything. It was very, very much like a college scene.

REDMAN: A lot of the young people--

CROSS: A lot of young people. We had our own apartment. We kind of did our own
thing. We were much more independent than college kids, so--

REDMAN: One of the things you mentioned was carpooling, and I&#039;d like to know
more about rationing, how rationing might have worked out for three young girls
living in a house.

CROSS: We lived in Dayton, and Wright Field was I don&#039;t know how far away. Maybe
twenty minutes by car.

REDMAN: So people had to carpool to a certain extent?

CROSS: So people had to carpool, just as you would in any company. And the guy
who drove us was an employee, a civilian employee. And he picked up two of us at
our apartment, and then he brought us back home again. So it was a carpool. I
don&#039;t remember any talk of--you know, I remember talk at home about gas
rationing and coupons and all of that kind of thing. I don&#039;t know whether he had
a special dispensation because of Wright Field. Anyway, we paid him weekly.

REDMAN: Of the rationing experiences, was there anything that was particularly
hard for your family to get? Some people talk about shoes or meat or stockings.

CROSS: I don&#039;t remember that. I do remember coloring the oleo to make butter.

REDMAN: Can you talk about that? For someone who hasn&#039;t experienced
that--nowadays, margarine is falsely colored yellow.

CROSS: Yes.

REDMAN: I think we&#039;re sort of ignorant of this.

CROSS: For some reason or other, you bought--margarine was white and you bought
little packets. And everybody insisted on coloring the margarine. Butter wasn&#039;t
even a choice. I think about half the time I did the mixing of this powder,
sprinkled this powder into this white lard-like stuff.

REDMAN: And did it taste all right? Was it a good substitute or was it not?

CROSS: I don&#039;t think I noticed it particularly. We just assumed it was butter.
We knew it was oleo. But, of course, by the time I got to Minnesota I was kind
of removed from that. I do remember my mother cutting coupons and doing
rationing and all of that sort of thing, which was kind of a big planning event.

REDMAN: But your mother was good at things like that?

CROSS: She was very good at it. Yes.

REDMAN: So that was not a problem?

CROSS: And so it wasn&#039;t a problem.

REDMAN: But then when you got to the University of Minnesota, I presume to a
certain extent those sorts of things were taken care of.

CROSS: They were taken care of automatically; it was like living in a dorm.

REDMAN: How about that apartment in Dayton? A lot of places, when there were new
defense plants popping up; it was really hard to find housing. Was that a
problem for the participants?

CROSS: Well, somebody must have helped us. It was a very modest little house. We
didn&#039;t have the whole house. And the three of us, three girls, had the second
floor, and we had a kitchen and all. It was kind of in--21 Point View Avenue was
the address. [laughs]

REDMAN: You do remember that? That&#039;s remarkable.

CROSS: It was a neighborhood of what I would call workmen, small houses, small
yards. Modest but not poor.

REDMAN: Let me ask one final question about the work, the actual job there. Were
you working on radar systems for only bombers, fighters, or for all types of aircraft?

CROSS: I think it was primarily bombers. The pictures I have in my folio are
mostly bombers. I think at that time the jet fighters were just coming in, and
they were very exciting. Now, there&#039;s something called a P-80, and a P-80 was
the very newest thing. So all of us around the field were very much intrigued
with the new things coming in. I was primarily concerned with these old big
bombers and just--it wasn&#039;t a particularly exciting job, but it was interesting
just because of the other things going on. And, of course, Wright Field
celebrated all kinds of parades and anything like that.

REDMAN: So you were intrigued, you might say, by these big bombers. But as the
technology just continued--and, of course, the war itself seems to only rapidly
increase the pace of the technological innovation.

CROSS: Yes, yes.

REDMAN: So the P-51 that comes out; I understand the nickname is the &quot;Cadillac
of the Sky.&quot; It looks like this gorgeous plane and then side by side with these
kind of clunkier big bombers. But then jets to come out at the end. It must have
been a remarkable transition.

CROSS: It really was, and we were fascinated with the jets in the sky as they
came in and landed. In fact, I blame part of my hearing trouble on that
experience at Wright Field, which was constantly planes taking off. We also had
the added privilege of being right near the machine gun firing range. And so
these machine guns would go off periodically. It was very, very noisy, as I look
back on it. Even at the time, I thought it was very noisy.

REDMAN: But things like hearing protection would have been unknown in those days.

CROSS: I didn&#039;t think anything of it, nor did anybody else. And I didn&#039;t develop
hearing loss until I was retired. So it wasn&#039;t a thing that I took home with me.

REDMAN: Certainly. This is the last question on this tape, but were there any
other sort of safety considerations that jump to mind?

CROSS: I don&#039;t remember that we were overly concerned--

REDMAN: You obviously must have had identification to enter and leave.

CROSS: Yes, of course, that, but I don&#039;t remember that it was even as much as an
airport is now. It was pretty casual. I think anybody really could have gotten
in if they really wanted--

REDMAN: Today is April 3, 2012 and this is my second tape today with Pat Cross
in Oakland, California. When we left off we were talking about your time at
Dayton Field in Ohio as a radar engineering aide. We were talking about some of
the major technological changes and innovations that were coming onboard. When
talking with people who worked in World War II during those days, I ask about
women entering the workforce. You&#039;d talked about how the campus environment was
changed in terms of the gender ratio, that so many men went away. But on the
other hand, uniformed men came to campuses. How about the factory? How about the
airplane plant? Or, sorry, the fields there.

CROSS: Well, you want to stay within the war years?

REDMAN: Sure.

CROSS: Because the things I have such vivid impression are the return of
servicemen after the war.

REDMAN: So we&#039;ll talk about that towards the end of the interview. So when you
come back between &#039;48 and &#039;58, when you get your bachelors through your PhD.
I&#039;ll ask about that. Because the GI Bill does all sorts of interesting things to
campuses that I&#039;d like to ask you about.

CROSS: Yes. That&#039;s much more vivid to me--

REDMAN: That&#039;s fine.

CROSS: --than the kind of war years but--

REDMAN: So we&#039;ll just jump through what you remember about the remainder of the
war years here. Can you talk about patriotism in those days? Wartime patriotism?

CROSS: Not much. Well, I think, actually, or maybe it&#039;s just my memory, but it
seems to me that we talk more about &quot;serving&quot; our country today than we did
then. It was just kind of assumed that the men were going away to war. I don&#039;t
think people thought of it in patriotic terms, or at least I didn&#039;t. It was
something that men had to do in those days. And most of the men I knew, of
course, were getting a college education out of it. They were not necessarily
the men who were going overseas and fighting. What we saw were the guys who
would not have had an education otherwise who were into the officer training on
university campuses and who were getting this wonderful education without a lot
of threat of going overseas at the time.

REDMAN: So you saw a lot of these young men who were coming to college campuses
and taking officer candidate school or language training or engineering or
things like that?

CROSS: Who had never entertained the idea of college before that time. So it was
a great privilege.

REDMAN: How about feelings of dissent? Were there people that wanted to stay out
of the war, get out of the war? Does that seem to disappear?

CROSS: Not like today. Or like my days as Dean of Students. No. There certainly
must have been, but they were not in my social realm. And I don&#039;t think we had
much talk of service to our country or criticism of the war. We were kind of
doing what was expected. We were typically middleclass, going along routes that
were neither terribly political, nor terribly economic. We were kind of the
great middle class.

REDMAN: Can you talk about perceptions, if you had any, of the Japanese or
Germans or Russians as an enemy or as a group?

CROSS: Well, we certainly thought the Nazis were really awful. And certainly we
must have thought that about others. It&#039;s not really something that stands out
in my mind.

REDMAN: But the Nazis, the evil of the Nazis--

CROSS: The Nazis stand out in my mind as really, yes. That was beyond.

REDMAN: Because it takes a while for Americans to learn about the depths of the
Holocaust, and really not until the end of the war do the images start to come
in in addition to the text descriptions of what was going on in Europe, I
understand. And stateside, I want to ask about the internment of the Japanese,
the order to send Japanese to relocation camps. That was an order that was
issued along the coast. I&#039;m wondering if you heard about that at all at the time.

CROSS: Well, obviously we were aware of it, but it didn&#039;t hit us like in
California. In Illinois and in Ohio, we would see it through the newspaper and
the news items, yes.

REDMAN: How about war bonds?

CROSS: Oh, yes. Well, war bonds.

REDMAN: Can you tell me, what&#039;s a war bond? Why would someone buy war bonds?

CROSS: Well, I think I bought mostly $25 war bonds. It was as an investment. I
think it was also expected. I don&#039;t think you made the decision about, &quot;I&#039;m
going to buy war bonds.&quot;

REDMAN: So it could come out of your paycheck, for instance?

CROSS: Yes. That was something you did. You automatically bought war bonds. I
think probably, now that I go back, food rationing had much more impact on the
societal things. What you could get at the grocery store and so forth. But I
don&#039;t think I regarded shortages of many things as particularly depriving or
anything. It was just something that was.

REDMAN: How about songs? Do you remember any popular songs? There was an old
song, I understand, that talked about men, that was &quot;they&#039;re all either too old
or too young.&quot;

CROSS: Yes, yes.

REDMAN: That&#039;s sort of an idea that we&#039;ve been talking about.

CROSS: Now, let me see. What were some of the songs? Was Bing Crosby--?

REDMAN: Sure.

CROSS: No? Well, Frank Sinatra.

REDMAN: Frank Sinatra early in that--okay.

CROSS: Yes. I think I remember it as a music culture, and I still love some of
those songs, contrary to today&#039;s music. [laughs]

REDMAN: Let&#039;s talk about when FDR dies. A lot of people are obviously very
saddened by that, and your family had for a long time been supporters of FDR. He
was probably the only president that you&#039;d ever known, so when he passes away
during the war did you have any particular feelings about that at that time or anything?

CROSS: Oh, I remember it was a very, very big national event. I don&#039;t think it
had personal impact, but we were glued, of course, to the television. My parents
followed his funeral to where he went in Georgia or where--

REDMAN: I don&#039;t recall, yes.

CROSS: And they particularly liked Eleanor. My mother loved Eleanor. And they
liked FDR, too, but Eleanor was really a very unusual woman in those days. My
mother liked unusual women, which is probably where [laughs] I took my encouragement.

REDMAN: We talked about how many people had to move during World War II and your
experience of being able to see Chicago and then Minneapolis for the first time
and then moving to Dayton, Ohio. What do you think that wartime migration of
people did to the country?

CROSS: Well, again, I don&#039;t think I was really aware of migration. It was more
to me like a college girl going off to a dorm. And even when I lived with my
fellow students in Dayton, Ohio, it wasn&#039;t as part of a community. It was just
three kind of college kids during a break in the war. So I wasn&#039;t aware of any
big migration. There certainly must have been one in Dayton, Ohio, with the
enormous influx of workers to Wright Field.

REDMAN: How long were you at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio?

CROSS: Probably about a year.

REDMAN: So at the end of the war, the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki. Were you still in Ohio at that time?

CROSS: Well, let me see. I guess I must have been because the war was pretty
much over when I came back home. A newspaper event.

REDMAN: Do you have any sort of recollections about what your thought was at the
end of the war? The direction sort of now that your life would take you?
Obviously you come back to Illinois.

CROSS: Well, I came back to Illinois and remember the war was almost more vivid
when I came back than it was during the war. One of the men without a leg and on
crutches was one of our friends. A lot of the men at college were coming back
from service. They were looking for wives. They didn&#039;t want to fool around. And
when I wasn&#039;t terribly interested in getting married, it was pretty irritating. [laughs]

REDMAN: So they were off to the next thing.

CROSS: Because, also, the thing that had really happened socially was women had
begun--I had been a minor supervisor of people, and I wasn&#039;t terribly interested
in settling down with a man, to cook and raise kids and so forth. I&#039;d had a
taste of independence, of being on my own. The men who came back from the war
were understandably interested in marriage and children. I did more dating then,
but the men became serious so fast that it was frightening, or at least to me.

REDMAN: I understand a lot of pressures on women--you would have been a unique
circumstance because you were college aged. But I understand a lot of women had
conflicting feelings in those days as the war was ending. They really loved
their independence. They loved their new job. They loved the accomplishment, the
sense of pride that went along with that work. But on the other hand, there was
a pressure, both from the men and often a personal desire, for them to have
children or do something else. Can you talk about maybe some of those tensions
that were swirling around in those days?

CROSS: Yes, the tension on me was very clear. I was still very much a career
woman. While I dated a lot, and even had a number of proposals, I wasn&#039;t
interested in settling down to raise a family. Until I really fell very much in
love with a guy who had not been in the service, who died unexpectedly, I
suspect because of radiation. He was a physicist, and he worked as a grad
assistant in the laboratory, the Betatron at the University of Illinois. He
enlisted and got required military service out of the way before we were
married. And he died after a short illness. Nobody could ever explain it.
Perhaps from the radiation at the Betatron. But I was madly in love with him, so
I had a very difficult time.

CROSS: I was working on a doctor&#039;s degree by this time. I got my master&#039;s, and
then there didn&#039;t seem to be anything exciting to do, and I kind of went on to
my doctorate. But the most interesting thing, I think the real changing point in
my life: I was working as a research psychologist. I was doing a lot of
statistics. IBM had just come in. Computers were big. I was working for a
research psychologist, and I was primarily a statistician. Even then I knew it
was terribly boring. But it was a well-paid assistantship, and there were labs,
of course supported by the government, all over the campus of the University of
Illinois. And these were labs that had to do mostly with the rising importance
of statistical data. So I always had an assistantship.

One day I was walking by the Dean of Women&#039;s office, and the door was open. She
looked like a nice friendly person. I walked in and I said, &quot;You know, I&#039;m not
sure I&#039;m in the right profession. I&#039;m finding myself really bored with these
assistantships, and I&#039;m not sure I want to be a professor. Tell me about
university administration.&quot; And so she told me a little bit about university
administration and I thanked her very much and left. Six months later she called
me, and she said, &quot;I remember you from our conversation.&quot; And she said, &quot;My Dean
of Sorority Women is getting married.&quot; Of course, if she was getting married,
she was resigning her position. She certainly wasn&#039;t going to do both. And she
said, &quot;I wonder if you would be interested in talking to me about being Dean of
Sorority Women.&quot; I said, &quot;I&#039;ve never even been in a sorority. I don&#039;t know the
Greek alphabet or anything about them.&quot; She said, &quot;Well, come talk to me anyway.&quot;

I really wasn&#039;t very happy with a doctorate in psychology, statistical
psychology. I went in and talked to her, and I said, &quot;I&#039;m still not sure about
sororities.&quot; And she said, &quot;Well, okay. I want you to come talk to our Dean of
Men.&quot; I talked to him about fraternities and so forth. So I was beginning to
think more and more about a change. I was really on kind of a fast track toward
a research psychology job. That fall she offered me a job as Dean of Sorority
Women. Well, what then? What did I do with my skills?

I put sorority rush on IBM machines. Which was the first time that had been done
in the country. Well, that swept the country, so I became rather well known as
that assistant dean at Illinois who introduced this new technology. That was a
huge change in my career at that point.

REDMAN: And you continued to do research in terms of educational psychology,
learning ability--

CROSS: It wasn&#039;t &quot;learning&quot; at that time at all. It was social psychology.
Largely &quot;population sampling&quot; and &quot;Pavlovian conditioning.&quot;

REDMAN: So if you would, in brief, when did the education aspect of it come in?

CROSS: Well, when I became Assistant Dean of Women.

REDMAN: So that really sparked your interest in higher education?

CROSS: That sparked my absorbed interest in higher education. But I went ahead
and got my PhD in social psychology. I didn&#039;t switch to education, which was
probably a good thing because the degree in psychology as a research degree had
more prestige to it and accounted for some of my other appointments, which would
not have been as possible if my doctorate had been education.

REDMAN: I recognize the next few questions I&#039;m going to ask you are absolutely
enormous. But I feel like we should, since we&#039;re having a good conversation
about higher education and some of the changes--in those days between. We talked
a little bit about the GI students that were coming back. And one thing that I
think is my distinct impression of something that happened at Berkeley and
elsewhere is that a lot of these young GIs--we sort of think about them in US
history as coming back and maybe getting bachelors degrees and then doing
something else. But for a number of these young men, I think it vaulted them
onto higher degrees.

CROSS: Yes.

REDMAN: Professional degrees, masters, PhDs. Was that the case with the young
men in your cohort?

CROSS: Well, that was of course the case with all of the men that I was dating.
They were in graduate school under the GI Bill. They were very bright, dedicated
to going on. And in most cases they were being paid, of course, by the federal
government, so that helped. But also there was a lot of work available. I had
plenty of work, both as a research psychologist and the Dean of Women&#039;s Office
then. So money was not a big problem. Continuation was. Part of the thing that
drove me out of psychology was the competition was just very bitter and very nasty.

REDMAN: I&#039;ve heard that before about psychology.

CROSS: It was very popular during the war, and so they were very selective. The
only reason I got in, I think, was because they were becoming very mathematical
at that point. It was dominated by Pavlov and &quot;conditioning&quot; and all of that. I
got accepted because of my math/physics background. But then the competition was
brutal. At the time of our prelims I think there were twelve of us who took
prelims. They failed six. Those six got together and offered themselves to the
University of Pittsburgh as a group. Went ahead and got their doctorate at the
University of Pittsburgh. Really thumbing their nose at Illinois.

REDMAN: So it was bitter in those--

CROSS: It was very, very nasty competition. And, of course, there were very few women.

REDMAN: Was that a draw in terms of your desire to get out of the research in
terms of--not get out of the research world; that would be inaccurate--but to
move away from that into more of a university administrative type of position?

CROSS: I think part of it was. I was driven out of it by the kind of nasty
things that I felt. I did not enjoy my graduate study in psychology at all
because it wasn&#039;t a holistic kind of thing, of thinking what you could do with
the knowledge. It was very much, of course, in the era of &quot;conditioned
responses.&quot; And the atmosphere was bad. I think part of my interest was escaping
in any way possible out of this future as a statistician.

REDMAN: Now, what about teaching? In terms of your own personal teaching and
pedagogy, did you fall in love with the activity of becoming a teacher or--?

CROSS: Not really. [laughs] What I did, of course, by the time I got my doctor&#039;s
degree in psychology, now I had a nice academic degree. And I had six years of
experience in Dean of Women&#039;s Office. So when I got my doctor&#039;s degree I could
have been an assistant professor of psychology maybe at a salary of $3,500 at a
state college, or I could go to a major university as dean of women at 6,500
annual salary.

REDMAN: Seems like a no-brainer.

CROSS: There was a lot of difference. And by this time, after six years as
assistant dean, I was really very interested in university administration. I was
offered a job at--and, again, it wasn&#039;t like today where you could be grateful
if you had an offer. It was where do I really want to go? And University of
Pennsylvania and Cornell both offered me jobs on the spot at my first interview.
I chose Cornell because, in part, I didn&#039;t want to live in the city. I liked
Urbana and I liked Ithaca. So it was really a very plush time to have that kind
of choice. Dean of Women at--

REDMAN: And combining that with a statistical and math background, focus on
women, and a PhD in psychology. It seems like it was a perfect moment to--

CROSS: Well, it made me very acceptable to faculty and students and the like. At
the University of Illinois--I should say this because you&#039;re interested in the
history of discrimination issues. At the University of Illinois, when I came in,
we had two rush periods. We had what was known as Chicago rush, which was
primarily Jewish and black sororities. We had four Jewish sororities and two
black sororities. And then we had twenty so-called &quot;general&quot; sororities. White.

And the Dean of Women, I must say, it was more her, but I went along with it.
She said, &quot;This is ridiculous to have this segregated rush.&quot; Presumably it was
on the grounds that the Chicago school systems graduated at a different time, so
it was called Chicago rush, and downstate rush held at different times during
the summer for recent high school graduates--. So she said, &quot;Let&#039;s offer only
one rush period.&quot;

REDMAN: That was a big change.

CROSS: It was very bold. During the campus discussions of integrated rush I
began to get visit after visit from national sorority officers. I finally said
to the Dean of Women, &quot;Is this usual?&quot; And she said, &quot;No, I think there&#039;s a
reason.&quot; Finally, one refreshing woman in &quot;sensible&quot; shoes stormed into my
office, and she said, &quot;Here&#039;s why I&#039;m here.&quot; And she laid this note on my desk
that said, &quot;Get down to the University of Illinois and find out what that new
dean is doing.&quot; And she said, &quot;So what are you doing?&quot;

REDMAN: So people were curious and maybe afraid of potential implications or
maybe imagined implications.

CROSS: Well, actually, I think the most threatened sorority houses were more the
Jewish houses. Because the Jewish girls were not that discriminated against. So
the other houses, the general houses, would take their best Jewish leaders. The
blacks didn&#039;t care much one way or the other. They knew they weren&#039;t going to
pledge the &quot;white&quot; sororities.

Let me take just a moment to talk about the sorority system at that time.
University of Illinois was the largest &quot;Greek System&quot; in the country. We had
twenty-seven national sororities. All new pledges, entering freshmen, were
required to live in the sorority house their first year. The national and local
sororities provided housing and full dormitory needs and supervision for some
1500 women students. My job at the tender age of twenty-seven was to work with
the resident &quot;house mothers&quot; who were usually upper-class widows, hired by the
national and local chapters to &#039;manage&#039; what were really small college dorms of
twenty to sixty women.

REDMAN: Some of these changes that you made on campus really caught the
attention of national sorority and fraternity organizations but then also other
deans and administrators, I presume.

CROSS: Oh, yes.

REDMAN: So that led then subsequently to the offer to go to Cornell and beyond.

CROSS: Yes. Well, the experience at Cornell was also kind of interesting
because, again, the social trends. I was the first female dean of students in
the country. Now, that&#039;s odd because you&#039;d ordinarily think of counseling as a
female occupation. I came as Dean of Women, and one year later I became Dean of
Men and Women! I want to just tell you because it was such a dramatic incident.
It was the beginning of the student uprisings, and the Free Speech Movement here
in Berkeley had spread around. Campuses were just kind of--&quot;unrest&quot; was the
right name. Unrest. And so the campus was in this period of unrest. At Cornell
as well as nationwide.

The Dean of Men at Cornell was an older man, not terribly popular with the new
movement, and so they kicked him upstairs, to Secretary of the University, and
decided to recruit a younger man for Dean of Men. I spent my entire time at the
professional meetings that spring looking for a compatible Dean of Men. When I
got back, the President came to my office and said, &quot;We&#039;d like to talk to you.&quot;
I said, &quot;Oh, wonderful, because I have this wonderful list. I have these two
wonderful assistant deans that I think we can get at Cornell as Dean of Men.&quot;
And he said, &quot;Well, come up to my office and we&#039;ll talk about it.&quot; I went up,
and I gave him these wonderful credentials. And he said, &quot;Well, we&#039;ve already
made a decision. We&#039;ve already selected the Dean of Men, and it&#039;s you.&quot; I
couldn&#039;t even absorb it.

REDMAN: How do you even process that in those days?

CROSS: In those days, there were deans of men and deans of women because there
were women&#039;s hours and all of these things. Women had house mothers, women&#039;s
hours, and an assortment of regulations that did not apply to men.

REDMAN: Did they combine your title then into Dean of Students?

CROSS: Anyway, I went away and I thought, &quot;I don&#039;t know.&quot;

REDMAN: So you were unsure at first.

CROSS: Well, what would be the men&#039;s reaction to having a woman as their dean? A
few campuses had begun to do it the other way. But the Dean of Men was promoted
to Dean of Students and the Dean of Women to Associate Dean of Students.

REDMAN: In those days. Sure, yeah.

CROSS: And to this day that exists to some extent. At any rate, it was unusual
enough to get my picture in Newsweek magazine [May 2, 1960] under the caption
&quot;Boss of 8,000 men.&quot; Well, that didn&#039;t help a whole lot either. But if I had
survived the racial and religious integration of sororities at University of
Illinois I was likely to survive the integration of genders at Cornell.

REDMAN: So you&#039;d gone from being the boss for three section eight guys
and--right, right?

CROSS: Yes, yes.

REDMAN: To 12,000 young Cornell students.

CROSS: It was 8,000 men and 4,000 women. And it went relatively well. Again,
there were certain people who were very much opposed to a woman. And one of the
men, one of the full professors, had the gall to suggest to me, he said, &quot;Well,
now who&#039;s going to serve on our discipline committee? The Dean of Men serves
there.&quot; I said, &quot;I guess I will.&quot; He said, &quot;Men do things that we wouldn&#039;t want
to talk about in front of you.&quot;

REDMAN: That was taken for granted that there was--

CROSS: That was taken for granted that this would be unseemly conversations to
be on the discipline committee that handled men and their various--

REDMAN: I wish I could talk to you about this all day because this is really
interesting. But unfortunately I&#039;m going to have to summarize this in one
question. Can you talk for me for just a moment, by way of summary, what you
think in terms of for--as being a woman who is a scholar who--and also an
administrator who&#039;s attracting attention in this regard on a campus and being
very successful and bold and making these--do you think the perception of you as
a woman, as a young female scholar at that time, that must be extraordinarily
different from what people go through today? Not to say that there is no
discrimination today because that would obviously not be the case. But can you
describe some of the changes?

CROSS: It was really very vivid. People can&#039;t even imagine it today. What the
perception of a woman in charge of men&#039;s programs would be.

REDMAN: You&#039;d mentioned the marital statuses. When a woman became married, that
she would--that was her ticket for retirement essentially.

CROSS: Yes. Now, remember, Cornell&#039;s a little bit later.

REDMAN: So now we&#039;re in the fifties and sixties.

CROSS: But the women&#039;s movement had not yet really taken place. It wasn&#039;t really
being talked about a lot, so this was a shock. And it was something of a shock
to me.

REDMAN: So for the benefit of this being at the Bancroft Library and UC Berkeley
in the future, can you talk for just a moment about how you ended up at Berkeley
later on?

CROSS: Yes. Let me see. I had left administration, and after several other
research and administrative and scholarly jobs and good opportunity to publish
and serve on national boards of higher education, I was a professor at Harvard.
I was very happy at Harvard. And once again I have to point out that at the time
we had one of the very first deans at Harvard as Dean of the School of
Education. And I was the chair of the largest department at Harvard, the Ed.
School--APSP [Administration, Planning, and Social Policy]. So I was very happy
at Harvard.

But Berkeley came courting and asked if I would come to Berkeley. I was looking
at the snows of Harvard, and I was pretty close to retirement age. I was within
five years of retirement when Berkeley came, and they said, &quot;We are going to get
an endowed chair.&quot; So at any rate, I came to Berkeley primarily--well, I was a
little bit concerned about the role of higher education, but I was assured of
future and--which didn&#039;t happen. So higher education really did not get full
play at Berkeley. Elementary and high school had become the big reform issues. I
enjoyed my time here, but it was not a role-changing kind of model.

REDMAN: Is there anything else that you&#039;d like to add about your time in
California? You&#039;ve now ended up in Oakland, and you&#039;ve got a fantastic view of
the lake and a lovely place. Instead of making you think of that that, what I
like to summarize with people, I like to ask, go over--we&#039;ve talked about the
Great Depression, elementary school, and life near the campus, and then going
away to the University of Minnesota, then to Wright Field, and then back to
Illinois State and the University of Illinois. Can you maybe think just for a
moment for me about World War II in the place of your life? We&#039;ve talked about
turning points today quite a bit. It seems like that in some ways was a big
turning point and in other ways it&#039;s sort of set up for other later turning
points in your life.

CROSS: Well, I guess I would say it was a turning point among many turning
points. The huge turning points were more in my role as a female. I happened to
be on that particular wave of change. The big thing about my war-years
experience, I suppose, was getting out of Normal, Illinois, being exposed to all
of this kind of environment, these new things. I might not have gone on for my
doctorate. I might have been a high school teacher forever. So that was a big
change. The women&#039;s movement had far more impact on my career than the war or
anything else, really.

REDMAN: So subsequently we&#039;re going to have to come back and do a women&#039;s
movement conversation. With that, I&#039;d like to say thank you so much for sitting down.

CROSS: Well, you&#039;re a wonderful interviewer.

REDMAN: Thank you so much.
