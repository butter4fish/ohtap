DUNHAM: It&#039;s May 6, 2016, and I&#039;m here in Suisun City, in the lovely home of
Elizabeth Fisher Tate, with her daughter Rella Rosboro, and we&#039;re here for the
Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front Oral History Project. So, we usually
start at the beginning. Can you tell me when and where you were born?

TATE: I was born in Plaquemines, Louisiana, February 2, 1923.

DUNHAM: Okay, and where is Plaquemines in Louisiana?

TATE: Plaquemines Parish is right outside of New Orleans. My dad was doing truck
farming at that time.

DUNHAM: Truck farming?

TATE: Yes.

DUNHAM: Okay, so what does that mean?

TATE: Gardening and things like that, but I knew nothing about Plaquemines,
because I went back to New Orleans with him as a baby.

DUNHAM: And can you tell me a little bit about your family background, maybe
starting on your mom&#039;s side, as much as you know of it?

TATE: I don&#039;t know too much about my mom&#039;s side. I only met my grandmother
through her and her sisters. They were mixed with French and Creole, and they
lived across in Algiers, in Louisiana. We used to ride a ferry boat to go over
to her place from New Orleans.

DUNHAM: So did you--you knew your maternal grandmother?

TATE: Yes, I knew her.

DUNHAM: What was life like for her?

TATE: Well, I don&#039;t know too much. She stayed with my aunt and I didn&#039;t get to
see her too much unless my mom would take us over to visit. She didn&#039;t speak
very good English, because she spoke broken French, and we could hardly
understand that.

DUNHAM: And how about on your father&#039;s side?

TATE: My father&#039;s side, I knew too. He was born in New Orleans and he didn&#039;t
speak the language like they did. When the family members would come over he&#039;d
ask them to speak so he could understand it, so that went on in the family for
quite a while. But he came from a family that, with--I think there were four
brothers and I think about three sisters, and my dad went to school. In fact, he
did--even college, but he never got good jobs because he was hard of hearing,
and in those days you didn&#039;t have the hearing aids and things like you have now.
So he just had to take any type of job, so he did a lot of work for the whites
as a gardener.

DUNHAM: And do you know where he went to college?

TATE: I don&#039;t know where he went to college, but he did say he did one year. He
was very smart and he was good--in fact, when I was in high school he would help
me with my math and everything. And I took trigonometry in my last class. He was
there to help me with that too.

DUNHAM: Okay, great. Well, how many brothers and sisters did you have, and where
did you fall?

TATE: I fell in the middle. Three older ones, and I had three sisters and three
brothers, and I made the middle one, which was seven of us, yeah.

DUNHAM: All right. And so what was life like growing up in New Orleans at that time?

TATE: Well, we were very poor, but I didn&#039;t know we were poor. And I remember a
time when I was in elementary school, and my dad had different ones to go stand
in line to get commodities and things when--my turn I told him no, I didn&#039;t want
to go. And he said, &quot;Well, you&#039;re going to have to go. Everybody else went.&quot; But
I didn&#039;t want anybody to see me in line. So when I went and got in line, most of
my classmates were in line, so it made me feel different about it then.
[laughing] You know, you&#039;re poor but yet still you had a lot of pride too.

DUNHAM: And what part of New Orleans were you in?

TATE: I was just across from Jefferson Parish, that&#039;s where Mom and Dad stayed,
and we moved into the middle part of the city near South Claiborne Avenue and
Third Street. That&#039;s where I grew up, and I went to high school in that area too.

DUNHAM: So what was school like? What do you remember of grammar school and that age?

TATE: I went to three grammar schools, one of which was Paul Laurence Dunbar,
James Weldon Johnson, and then from there I went to Hoffman High and my high
school was McDonogh 35. So I finished--we only went to the eleventh grade then.
Yes, so I finished high school from there.

DUNHAM: In the spring of &#039;40?

TATE: In June of 1940.

DUNHAM: June of &#039;40, okay. Well, can you tell me a little bit more about what
life was like for you growing up? What did you do for fun?

TATE: Well, we did our own thing. We were very creative in doing things. We
made--my brothers would cut up wood in thin sides and make frames for a kite. We
used paper for the kite and used flour and water to paste it with. Then old rags
around we&#039;d make the tail, and it flew just as high as the kites you see flying
now. And then we had--we played jacks a lot. There&#039;s a game called jacks we
played. And for a yo-yo, I remember taking Coca-Cola tops and putting a kitchen,
in between the--

DUNHAM: String?

TATE: String, and then put the string on and made our yo-yos. We did all of
these things to entertain ourselves. And then I remember--I was saying I was an
entrepreneur before my time. I bought a scraper and some ice and I had a
snowball stand on my porch.

DUNHAM: Oh wow!

TATE: So I got the prettiest colors, like grape and strawberry. Those were the
only two colors I had, and I sold three cents a scoop and two for a nickel. It
was really--[laughing]

DUNHAM: Oh my goodness! How old were you when you started that?

TATE: I was about--I guess about twelve or thirteen, yeah.

DUNHAM: So where would you get the ice and the syrups?

TATE: Well, see I&#039;d get the block from the people that came around on a wagon
and horses. And my dad brought the scraper for me, so that&#039;s how.

DUNHAM: Did he show you how to use it then?

TATE: No, I knew how to use it because I had seen other people do it, you know?

DUNHAM: Okay, wow! That&#039;s quite entrepreneurial. So what did you do with your earnings?

TATE: Well, my earnings I kept it for myself, and then later on my sister wanted
to help me, but she was giving it away to her friends, so I wasn&#039;t making any
money then. [laughter] But the money I made would buy different little things,
like I wanted--like to make candy, with the coconut and sugar. I would make
praline candies for my church to raise some money for our Sunday school classes
and things like that.

DUNHAM: Did you teach yourself how to make the pralines too?

TATE: Yeah, I did that.

DUNHAM: So where did you go to church?

TATE: I went to a Baptist church that was next door to where we lived, and I&#039;d
study--when I was a little girl I had a lot of time, because I was teaching
Sunday school at that time, and then I sang in a choir. The children, they were
my age and some older, so we had--we had different things, programs that we had
at our church that I took part in and recited in. My dad would tell me--he would
write papers for me to do, welcome addresses and responses at different
churches. But I couldn&#039;t read it. I had to memorize it, and right now that
memory is doing me well, because I recite poems now, all over.

DUNHAM: Wow. Well, I can tell your memory is outstanding!

TATE: [laughing] I just did a poem yesterday for the Women of Wisdom. It&#039;s a
club here. They invited me over. And about two weeks ago the sorority sisters
had a crab feast and I was invited there to do a poem there for them.

DUNHAM: Wow. So what are some of the poems that you do?

TATE: One of them is &quot;The Master.&quot; And I did a Mother&#039;s Day poem, &quot;Somebody&#039;s
Mother.&quot; And then I also do scriptures that I study and remember them and do
those things too. And &quot;The Creation&quot; is one of them I did, by James Weldon
Johnson. That&#039;s one of the schools I went to, and he was the author of that
poem. Most of my poems were by black authors.

DUNHAM: And so growing up was--the area and the school were completely segregated?

TATE: Oh yes. We had our separate schools. We used books from the white schools.
I never will forget. Most of the books they had written in them and you could
barely see what you were reading, so that&#039;s the type of life that we had at that
time. But my dad always taught us different things about life, you know, just
study hard, and you&#039;ll be able to make something out of yourselves when you get
older, so that&#039;s what we did. And coming home from school we would have lots of
things that--I remember one time we were coming home from school and a guy had a
bakery, and he had taught his parrot to call us the N word.

DUNHAM: Oh my.

TATE: Yes, and so when we would come home from school--the parrot was upstairs
in the window saying those things to us. The boys wanted to go up, but they
couldn&#039;t. I said no, they&#039;d get in trouble, so we&#039;d just pass him by. So many
different things that happened at that time, but my dad kept us close at home.
In fact, he wouldn&#039;t let his girls go out to work for the whites at all. We&#039;d
stay at home. But the boys had paper routes and milk routes. And I remember my
two brothers were working in a white neighborhood, and they called the cops and
put them in jail. But my dad worked for some rich whites called the Werleins,
and she called and told them, &quot;Those boys were working. Let them out of there.&quot;
See, that&#039;s the way you got things done then, by rich people at that time.

DUNHAM: Wow. That you&#039;d had to build up a relation--

TATE: Yes.

DUNHAM: Do you know what they were accused of?

TATE: They were in a white neighborhood.

DUNHAM: Just being there. They were just arrested.

TATE: Yeah, but they were delivering milk. So I remember those things. So my dad
used to try to keep us as close as he could, at home, and so we wouldn&#039;t have
get into things like that, you know.

DUNHAM: Well, so he protected you more, but did you have some interactions with
whites growing up then? Or what was--?

TATE: Not really. Not really.

DUNHAM: When you said they had written in the book, do you mean that they
crossed out the--?

TATE: That&#039;s right. The books we used were written in because--and then they
would give it to the black schools. That&#039;s what we had.

DUNHAM: But you mean just notes? Or you mean that they deliberately made them unusable?

TATE: Well, I guess they wrote in the book and things like that, but things
that--a lot of times we had a chance to read what my teachers would tell us what
the next thing was, if it was a letter missing or something like that.

DUNHAM: Did you have any particular inspirational teachers growing up?

TATE: Oh yes! We had some very good teachers. All my teachers were black
teachers. And my daughter just found out about my principal, Mr. [Lucien Victor]
Alexis. She was telling me, she said, she remembered me calling his name, so she
saw on the Internet some things about him. He was a very educated man. And she
said the school I went to was a good school because he had the school, and all
his teachers that he brought in were very learned people, and that taught us
very well.

DUNHAM: Were there other--so your father protected you and knew folks to help
when your brothers got in trouble. Did you know of other kids or adults who were
African American who were not so fortunate and who had--?

TATE: No. I didn&#039;t. It was just things that I knew at home that would happen and
things like that.

DUNHAM: What kinds of things?

TATE: Yeah, well kids--they couldn&#039;t go in certain areas and neighborhoods. If
you were in a white neighborhood, you were subject to get picked up or
something. And I know this much too--in the neighborhood we lived my dad paid
taxes like everybody else, but our streets were never paved like other streets.
It was always mud. You walked through the mud to get home when it rained and
stuff like that. So that was an injustice to the black race at that time too.
And we all--in fact, everything we did was among ourselves, like baseball. We&#039;d
go to the parks, we&#039;d sit, and watch the guys play ball. My cousin was a
left-handed pitcher. We would go out to the park, and that&#039;s the way we enjoyed
ourselves, and we had things going on for ourselves.

DUNHAM: And then were there stores and restaurants that were black-owned and
that you could--?

TATE: No. We had nothing--most of--we had an Italian store on the corner. At
that time you could buy on credit. They had a list. They&#039;d put your name down
and things like that, what you would buy. And my mother had a brother that would
come over and visit--he lived across the river, like I told you. His friends
were Italian and he learned how to speak the Italian language. So when he&#039;d come
over to the store he would listen and he would say things. A lot of them
followed us home to find out where he learned how to speak their language. But
he was an unlearned man. He had never gone to school, but by being among his
friends, he learned their language.

DUNHAM: Interesting.

TATE: And my sister used to say ooh, if he had gone to school and had a brain,
he would have really been something. But most of my mom&#039;s people they didn&#039;t
hardly go to school. My mom didn&#039;t either. I taught my mom, when my minister had
a room at his house that he asked me would I teach them how to read and write,
which I did. And my mom was one of my students too. They would pay me
twenty-five cents to teach them, and I would go to the--it wasn&#039;t a bookstore, a
Salvation Army store, and get books from there to have it there. I had one guy,
he was a carpenter and he built homes and things, but I didn&#039;t know he couldn&#039;t
read and write. But he was smart enough to hire people that did know how. And so
when he learned how to write his name in my class, he cried and I did too. I was
just a young person, but I had a heart for him, and I always thought he was
smart, but this is the way--but he built beautiful homes and everything.

DUNHAM: Yeah, what an opportunity. So these--you were doing these classes with
groups of people or one-on-one?

TATE: With groups, yeah. From my church they would come, those that couldn&#039;t
write their names. He would have them come, and I&#039;d teach them the ABCs from the beginning.

DUNHAM: So about how old were you when you started doing that?

TATE: I was in high school then.

DUNHAM: So you were, it seems like, excelling all around. Did you have
opportunities in high school, with your memory, speeches or that type of thing?

TATE: Well, in high school, a lot of times, like in my literature class, we had
to memorize. Well, that&#039;s how we did poems. And from my dad having me to
memorize the papers he wrote, that&#039;s how I got my memory going and everything.
So even when I moved here, I wanted to learn different scriptures. When I
walked, I used to walk four miles a day and I would go over and over until I got
it. Some of my scriptures I&#039;d do chapters from the Bible too.

DUNHAM: Well, when you were growing up, what was a typical day like for your mom?

TATE: My mom did domestic work and we kids had to do the work at home, cooking
and--my oldest sister--well, the older you were, you took care of the rest of
the family. My older sister would cook, and my brothers learned how to cook. I
remember one time when my sister married, my brother was in charge of the
cooking and he made spaghetti, and we couldn&#039;t eat it, because he didn&#039;t rinse
the spaghetti, and so we wouldn&#039;t eat it. [laughing] So he told Mama he tried to
get us to eat, and she tasted it and she said no wonder it didn&#039;t taste good.
Later on, he got to be a steward on a ship, then promoted to a chef when he put
his cooking experience to use.

DUNHAM: Okay, okay, so he remembered to rinse after that. [laughter] Well, and
what about for your father then, what was a typical day like for him?

TATE: My father worked--he did work for the rich. He did gardens and things like
that. My dad worked for the Werleins. They owned a music store there in New
Orleans. He worked for them. And then he worked for some people called the
Stewards. And I remember my dad--not his parents, some members of the family had
purchased a home. We lived on General Scott Street, and his mom was a cook for
the Stewards, and they would offer her gifts. She would take it and they would
put a price on it, but she didn&#039;t know it. So, they took our home from us. They
added everything up, and we couldn&#039;t fight them because we had no way of doing
it. We had no money and everybody was white, the juries, the lawyers, and things
like that. So, that&#039;s how we lost our home.

DUNHAM: Wow. So can you tell me a little more about that? When was that?

TATE: That was when I was a little girl, and you could hear your parents talk
about these things. And his mom worked for them, and they would give her gifts,
you know, but she didn&#039;t know they were putting a price on it. So, I remember
that so well.

DUNHAM: Wait, his--who worked for who?

TATE: My dad&#039;s mom.

DUNHAM: Your dad&#039;s mom worked for this family.

TATE: My grandmother.

DUNHAM: And they gave her gifts, which then they say added up to taking your home?

TATE: That&#039;s right, to taking their home from them. He couldn&#039;t do anything
about it. My brother, when he got of some size, he tried to go to the courts to
bring it up again, but he couldn&#039;t do anything because you had to hire the white
lawyers and things like that, and everybody was for each other, so we couldn&#039;t
do anything.

DUNHAM: Now was the home in a--?

TATE: It was in New Orleans on General Scott Street. I never will forget it.

DUNHAM: And was it an all-black neighborhood?

TATE: Yes, an all-black neighborhood. And the houses then were built like
double, together, you know, so they had a double house together. And then he had
a little place in the back of the house, like a little apartment and everything.
So, all of that was gone. It was a corner house. When I got older he would take
us down where they used to live and then I could see all of what he was telling
us about.

DUNHAM: So they had owned the home and then--

TATE: It was taken away from them.

DUNHAM: --a white family took the home.

TATE: By white rich people.

DUNHAM: But they didn&#039;t move in there, did they?

TATE: No. I don&#039;t know what happened to it after that.

DUNHAM: Wow.

TATE: Yeah, that was some experience I remember from a child.

DUNHAM: Was there anything else about your childhood that you wanted to share,
and growing up in New Orleans before we--?

TATE: Well, I was always a type that read--I read a lot and everything, and my
minister would ask me to teach the class and things.

So. when I was a teenager my dad never wanted us to go to nightclubs or
anything. This particular time the Ink Spots were singing at a nightclub and my
middle sister, she said that she had been working some place, at a store or
something, saved her money and bought a ticket for me, and I believed what she
said, that Papa knew all about her ticket and we could go. So the night that we
were supposed to go my mom said, &quot;Does your daddy know that you&#039;re going?&quot;
Because he didn&#039;t believe in those kinds, so she said, &quot;Yes.&quot; So Mama asked him.
He said, &quot;No, they&#039;re not going.&quot; So we had to go sell our tickets, and in the
meantime we had told the kids in church that we wouldn&#039;t be at church because we
were going to the Rhythm Club. &quot;Your dad&#039;s letting you go to Rhythm Club?&quot; So,
we said yes. So, he could have let us stay home, but they were singing that
night in a choir and he made us go to church. And when they saw us everybody
just laughed, and I was so disappointed. [laughing] I could have gone through
the floor, because I had them believing we were going to do all of this, first
time going--so that&#039;s something I remembered in my life. My dad was very strict.

DUNHAM: Why did he not want you to go?

TATE: Because he didn&#039;t believe in nightclubs and places like that, you know?
Very religious, he was a Bible scholar. My dad had read the Bible from front to back.

DUNHAM: Okay, because they serve alcohol there?

TATE: Yeah, things like that and dancing and stuff--

DUNHAM: So did you rebel against that in any other ways, or your siblings? Did they?

TATE: No. We had to accept it. We had to accept whatever he said--I should have
asked him myself, but she told me she had asked, and I believed her. But I
didn&#039;t want the kids to think that we weren&#039;t there. So that was one--we never
tried that again.

DUNHAM: Did your mom hold the same views?

TATE: My mom always would tell us we could do a thing, &quot;But did you ask your
dad?&quot; So, we knew what was going to happen if we asked him, and he was like that
on the boys too. Nine o&#039;clock they had to be in the house. Nobody had a key to
the house. He was like that.

DUNHAM: And so you graduate high school in June of &#039;40, right?

TATE: Forty.

DUNHAM: Okay, and then what happened from there?

TATE: From there, that&#039;s when I saw in the paper that they were asking for
people for defense work and they would train you, and I asked my dad could I go?
And he said yes, so then I went to this school where Mrs. Roosevelt was over it,
but she had Ms. Mary McLeod Bethune to be over the National Youth
Administration, and that&#039;s when I had the training there, for defense work, when
the war had started then.

DUNHAM: So what was that training like? And did you meet Ms. Bethune?

TATE: I never met her. I&#039;ve read about her.

DUNHAM: Okay, but you knew she--yeah, really amazing.

TATE: But I never met her.

DUNHAM: Okay, so what was that--how long was that training?

TATE: Well, the training--I guess it lasted about two or three months or so, and
when we finished that we had to have more training, and they sent us away to
Bremerton, Washington. That&#039;s where I did my other training.

DUNHAM: So was the training right after high school?

TATE: Yes.

DUNHAM: Okay, and did you--?

TATE: I had just finished high school.

DUNHAM: And did you ask your dad?

TATE: Oh yes!

DUNHAM: And he was--

TATE: I was so glad that was the first time I&#039;d ever left New Orleans, and they
were willing to let me go.

DUNHAM: He didn&#039;t have any concerns?

TATE: No, but he always told me to be careful of wolves in sheep&#039;s clothing. So
I learned what that was about. [laughing] Yeah, so--they were at the train
station to see me off and everything.

DUNHAM: Yeah. Well, can you tell me a little more about that? So that initial
training you got, what were you doing exactly?

TATE: Well, they had the Lathe machine. On that machine, we&#039;d work with the
material to make bolts and nuts. It was a greasy job, and the measurements had
to be perfect. So it was good training, and we had the same training when we
went to Bremerton, Washington, except we learned how to read blueprints.

DUNHAM: Okay, and when you got the training in New Orleans was it all African
American women who were giving the training?

TATE: Well, it was several whites in the training too, but they didn&#039;t leave
when we left. I guess they were separated then. See, all of us, all the black
girls left together on the train.

DUNHAM: Did you interact during the training? Or what was that like, do you remember?

TATE: No, we didn&#039;t.

DUNHAM: And who was doing the training?

TATE: It was a white guy training us in everything. All our trainers were white,
because I don&#039;t know if any blacks were in machining training, had anything to
do with it. So, when we went to Bremerton it was the same way there, but it was
a larger place. People from all over were there, whereas in New Orleans we just
had the one shop there that they were training us in.

DUNHAM: Okay, and so the training is through the summer of &#039;40? And then is it
the fall of &#039;40--?

TATE: Yeah, and it lasted about--yeah, we left about--the weather was good when
we left. At that time, you know, you never pay attention to different things.

DUNHAM: So this is well before Pearl Harbor and the United States joining the war.

TATE: Oh yes, yes.

DUNHAM: And so had you been out of state before?

TATE: No. The first time I&#039;ve ever left home, and from the training we got at
home we knew how to handle ourselves when we went away.

DUNHAM: So what kind of training, or what did you know to do?

TATE: Well, separating the good from the bad. That&#039;s the way it is. When you saw
something bad, you didn&#039;t bother with that. You didn&#039;t want to be a part of it,
because we were brought up in a Christian home. Mostly the Bible we went by.

And when I got to Bremerton I did meet a white girl there, and she got to be my
friend. But my friends didn&#039;t want me around her. It works both ways because I
was with them, I said, &quot;No, she&#039;s my friend.&quot; We ate lunch together. I think she
was from Wisconsin, and she had never been around the blacks before other than
seeing them in the movies. So, she had a chance to learn from me, and I had a
chance to learn from her. So she says, &quot;In your race,&quot; she says, &quot;that&#039;s all
I&#039;ve ever seen.&quot; And I said, &quot;We have the same thing in our race that you have.
We have doctors, lawyers, teachers, but those things you don&#039;t see.&quot; She only
saw butlers and dancers and stuff like that, you know. So I told my friends, I
said, &quot;She&#039;s learning from me.&quot; And I said she was telling me about her family
and everything.&quot; You know, how she was kept close at home too. She was never
around the blacks, and she was so happy--she didn&#039;t know how to react with me.
So I told her, &quot;I&#039;m just like you! This is the color of our skin.&quot; She got to be
my best friend while I was in Bremerton.

DUNHAM: Oh wow. Did you work together?

TATE: Yeah, we worked together, and ate lunch together and everything.

DUNHAM: She was doing--and where were you living when you first--?

TATE: We were living in dormitories. We were mixed in the dormitories.

DUNHAM: Oh yeah?

TATE: Yeah.

DUNHAM: So what was that like?

TATE: That was really something, because it was just like you had just showers
and things. I&#039;d never been in anything, because I always--it was private for
bathing and things. And I said, &quot;Oh my gosh! They&#039;re going to be looking at you
taking your shower.&quot; Well, I got used to that and everything.

One of our chaperones wanted to go out one night, and I don&#039;t know why she
picked me to take her place. She said, &quot;Watch over the girls.&quot; So I said, &quot;You
want me?&quot; She said, &quot;Yeah, I want you to do it.&quot; So I did, and I took care,
watching over--and they thought they were going to go out because I was young
like them. And so I just told them, I said, &quot;If you go, I&#039;m going to write your
name down.&quot; So that went--they didn&#039;t go anyplace. They were kept in. So, they
were angry with me because I&#039;m being strict now. But I had to do what she told
me to do, you know?

DUNHAM: Now, you weren&#039;t the oldest, were you? You just were the--?

TATE: No, I wasn&#039;t. Just something about me that she just figured she could
trust the girls with me, you know?

DUNHAM: Yeah, I&#039;m not surprised. But I just wanted to clarify that you were one
of the youngest, I assume, right?

TATE: Yes. But I followed her direction, and everybody stayed in. When she came
back they were all--everybody was in their rooms and things.

DUNHAM: Because you&#039;re--are you seventeen still?

TATE: I was seventeen. I was eighteen when I left because you had to be
eighteen. But I was seventeen when I finished high school.

DUNHAM: So when you left it was early in &#039;41?

TATE: It was in--I know I finished in &#039;40. It could have been in &#039;41. You know,
you&#039;re not keeping up with dates or anything.

DUNHAM: But you would turn eighteen February of &#039;41, right?

TATE: Yeah, I turned eighteen. Yeah.

DUNHAM: So you had to be eighteen, unless--

TATE: Yeah, to, yeah to--yes.

DUNHAM: I know sometimes people didn&#039;t--they might have exaggerated their age

TATE: No, no, not--

DUNHAM: But no, probably not you.

TATE: No, because my brothers had gone to the military. They were inducted those
days, two of them. And then the youngest one left later.

DUNHAM: So that would have been after Pearl Harbor?

TATE: Yes.

DUNHAM: But you were there--well, do you remember where you were when you heard
about the attack on Pearl Harbor?

TATE: No, I don&#039;t remember that. I only remember when the war ended.

DUNHAM: At the end, okay.

TATE: I remember that.

DUNHAM: Okay, well, we&#039;ll get to that. I was curious too, going back to New
Orleans, I know you mentioned also that your father had some--you lived through
the Depression, of course, but some opportunities through the New Deal and
public works? Is that right?

TATE: Yeah, he worked for the WPA.

DUNHAM: And what did he do?

TATE: They did streets and things like that, digging roads and stuff like that.
That&#039;s what he did.

DUNHAM: And was that a good opportunity for him? Did that--?

TATE: Yeah, it was more money to take care of his family.

DUNHAM: So, he did that instead of having to work for the white families?

TATE: The whites, that&#039;s right.

DUNHAM: And did it change any opportunities for your mom?

TATE: No, Mom still worked, did domestic work. But we were left home to take
care of the cooking, the cleaning, and the washing and stuff, so she wouldn&#039;t
have to do that.

DUNHAM: I know in your bio you mentioned about, of course, not having money for
doctors, per se, and the family believed in--or--go ahead. Home--?

TATE: We did home remedies.

DUNHAM: Yeah, can you tell me a little about that?

TATE: Okay. My dad would slice red onions and put sugar on them and put it
outside on the top of a shed for the dew to hit it. It made syrup for us for our
coughing and everything.

DUNHAM: Oh! So how did you collect the syrup then?

TATE: From the juice from the onion and the sugar. And then he would take a
brown paper bag and put mutton, mutton comes--on it and put it in front of the
fireplace, heat it up when we had bad chest colds, and put it on our chests to
break the cold and everything. So we did a lot of three sixes [666 Cold
Preparation], castor oil and--

DUNHAM: Three sixes? What&#039;s that?

TATE: It&#039;s a bitter medicine that was for colds and things like that, and then
castor oil. We hated that. It was oil and they would put it in orange juice or
else some black coffee and give it to us.

DUNHAM: Just when you&#039;re sick? Or is that a preventive?

TATE: When we were sick from a cold. But to prevent us, in the spring, from
being sick, he would mix up sulfur and molasses, and we would all line up and
get a tablespoon of that to clear your body out for the spring. So those--

DUNHAM: How was that? Was that tough to get down too?

TATE: Oh yeah, it was awful! It was bad. [laughing]

DUNHAM: Did you keep any of these home remedies? Are there any that you still use?

TATE: I did. I did with my kids, yeah. [laughter]

DUNHAM: I guess so. Did they go another generation? Or was that the end?

Rosboro: That was the end.

DUNHAM: Oh, all right. Well, I was curious--

TATE: Because we didn&#039;t have money to go to doctors or anything. And then my dad
and my oldest sister, they were the only two that were sort of deaf in the
family. And we found out that they did have a black doctor at the time that used
a lot of--I forget the name of this medicine that they would--

Rosboro: Quinine.

TATE: Quinine. A lot of quinine. And they seemed to think that that&#039;s what
caused the deafness. I don&#039;t know.

DUNHAM: The hearing.

TATE: Yeah, the hearing, yes.

DUNHAM: Did they go completely deaf?

TATE: Well, my sister, she could hear a little. My dad could hear a little, but
you had to scream at him.

DUNHAM: At a pretty early age? Or only--

TATE: Yeah, my sister was at an early age. And she got operated on at Children&#039;s
Hospital in San Francisco. They found out that they could help her. And her kids
had been yelling at mom all the time. So, she had never heard the rain hit the
windows or anything till that next morning after her operation. She cried
because she had never heard the rain.

DUNHAM: She was living out here at the time?

TATE: Yes. So my dad, when he came out, we had him go. It helped him a little
because he was older then. So, we got a hearing aid for him and everything and
he had the little phone that he used. If you telephoned, he would--his hearing
aid was down in here and he would put the phone down there and talk. Yeah, so
when he was out here.

DUNHAM: So that would connect. How did that work?

TATE: It worked well with him! I don&#039;t know why it was like that, but he would
always put the phone on his chest because the hearing part--I don&#039;t know. It
wasn&#039;t in his ear; it was down here some kind of way. I don&#039;t know.

DUNHAM: Well, back to--so Bremerton. So, when you got there you got some
more--well, let me ask first--when you got the training in New Orleans and you
agreed to come up to Bremerton, did you already have a job contract?

TATE: Yes. They already had jobs for us there.

DUNHAM: Okay, and so did you know what it would pay, and do you remember what it paid?

TATE: I don&#039;t remember what it paid, but it paid me enough that I could help my
dad and mom. So, they didn&#039;t own anything, and I talked to mom on the phone and
told her to tell dad to look for some land, and I would help them. So, every two
weeks I would send part of my check to them, and they bought the land. After it
was paid for, I told them for him to start building and that I would continue to
send money. And I did. And my dad was very smart. He laid the foundation for his
house and he built a three-bedroom house and a bath and a living room and a
kitchen. My dad came to California, my sister was living in Richmond and
working. My dad laid the foundation for her home. And the city came out to check
it out and asked him what school did he go to? Because it was a perfect thing.
He had made no mistake in it.

DUNHAM: So, how did he learn to do that?

TATE: Well, he had one year of college, I told you. He was very smart in math,
he was very smart. And all of my nephews, they all were good in math too. They
formed a corporation in Oakland for surveying and mapping, they went to school
for that too.

DUNHAM: And did you like math as well?

TATE: Well, I didn&#039;t--I wasn&#039;t very good in math, but then I began to put things
together, and the Roman numerals and all that--I said, &quot;I wonder why do we have
to learn all of this.&quot; [laughing] But we did. So anyway, I did enough to pass my
geometry class and all, and also my algebra class. I passed that and everything.
But I took French, and my people talked the broken French. My dad didn&#039;t want it
in the house. I wish he had, because it would have been better for me to have
known that.

DUNHAM: Why did he not want it?

TATE: Because he didn&#039;t understand what they were saying. But Mama would talk
with her family when they--they would talk and everything. My grandmother and my
aunt, you couldn&#039;t hardly understand what they were saying because they had more
of that in them than speaking English.

DUNHAM: When you studied French did it help you pick up more?

TATE: Oh yes, it did! Yeah. Because like we were saying comment ça va?, in
broken French and comment allez-vous when we were saying it in schools, you
know, so those kinds of things I was picking up on too. I used to speak it real
good, but then when you get away from those things. I even took sign language in
North Carolina, because most of the people were deaf there.

DUNHAM: Oh, later.

TATE: That lived around where I was.

DUNHAM: Oh really?

TATE: Yeah. But I learned enough to communicate with them a little and I even
did a song, &quot;What a Friend We Have in Jesus,&quot; in sign language. I couldn&#039;t do it
now because--[laughing]

DUNHAM: Okay, okay. Well, I won&#039;t ask you. I won&#039;t put you on the spot. Well, I
didn&#039;t ask before--when you were growing up--but what types of things did you
eat growing up? Did you have French Creole influence?

TATE: We had vegetables and meats and things like that. My dad had a big garden.
We had string beans and greens, lots of greens, cabbage, onions, and stuff. He
grew all of that. The only thing he had to buy was the meat, and then he would
go to the waterfront and bring the plantains home. You know what a--the
plantain. It&#039;s like a banana.

DUNHAM: Oh okay, plantain.

TATE: Yes, so we had a lot of that. And most of the time they&#039;d buy things by
the sackful, so potatoes and stuff like that.

DUNHAM: Did you learn to work in the garden at all, growing up?

TATE: Yeah, I have a flower garden I used to work here, since I&#039;ve been--even in
North Carolina I did. Growing tomatoes and stuff, I did that too.

DUNHAM: Well, I ask because I was wondering what was it like leaving home that
first time when you got to Bremerton?

TATE: Oh, it was really something, because my first--we used to drink coffee out
of a small cup, and when I left home it was big cups of coffee, and I
couldn&#039;t--I said why would they serve it in big cups like that? [laughing] Well,
I couldn&#039;t drink it all because I was used to small cups. My mama kept little
cups at home. That&#039;s what we drank out of. Anyway, the food--I had to learn to
enjoy whatever I had. When we were in Bremerton there was this girl and her
brother that got a little apartment together. They didn&#039;t live with us. And so
we would go to their place to cook. So, I cooked cabbage and corn bread, and I
had pork chops, so that was my day for cooking. So, after they ate my cooking,
they wanted me to be the cook. I said &quot;no&quot; because everybody is going to do
their own cooking.&quot; On my day I did what I had to do.

DUNHAM: So was that at the dorm or somewhere else?

TATE: That was at this brother and sister&#039;s. They got a place by themselves, and
they had a stove and a kitchen.

DUNHAM: Was this part of the group of seven that came out originally? No, it was
a different girl.

TATE: No, no, these were the people that we met when we got there.

DUNHAM: The additional training you got at Bremerton, how long did that go on?

TATE: Well, it wasn&#039;t too long, because we were getting paid while we were being trained.

DUNHAM: And in New Orleans during the training you did not get--?

TATE: No, no.

DUNHAM: Did you have to pay for it?

TATE: No.

DUNHAM: Okay, it was free, but you didn&#039;t get paid.

TATE: Free, because Miss Bethune wanted to have jobs for black girls for defense
work, so we didn&#039;t have to pay anything, because we couldn&#039;t afford to.

DUNHAM: So, do you remember your first day on the job?

TATE: At Bremerton? Yeah, I remember we all went in, and the person that was in
charge of us in the shop introduced himself and told us what we had to do. He
assigned us to different machines and gave us blueprints. That&#039;s when we learned
how to read the blueprints there.

DUNHAM: So you hadn&#039;t seen blueprints before?

TATE: No, no, no.

DUNHAM: So, how did you learn?

TATE: He told us how to. And the measurements, they would have it on the paper,
the measurements of each thing. Threads, how many inches of threads in a head
and stuff like that, so that&#039;s how we learned how to do that.

DUNHAM: Was it challenging?

TATE: Yes, because it was new to you. Anything new is challenging, but if you&#039;re
willing to learn you just go in and put your head into doing that, you know.

DUNHAM: And so was it fun?

TATE: Well, it wasn&#039;t fun at first, but after you got into it, it was just like
any other job. You knew what you were doing. When you don&#039;t know a thing, it&#039;s
different, but once you get to know it then everything just falls right into place.

DUNHAM: And so what was a typical day? Were you working day shift? Did they have--?

TATE: Yeah, we worked from eight to four thirty, half an hour for lunch. I
remember that, because I had never been on a job before, but I remember from
eight to four thirty. We&#039;d have half an hour for lunch, and then we&#039;d get off
and go back to the dormitories.

DUNHAM: And so at the--I know you were talking about eating at the other place,
but did the dormitories have food, or how did that work?

TATE: Yes, they had food there, because we had kitchen duties. It seemed like in
the military, you know, so you had KP and you had to watch everything that went
on to know what to do and everything. We had to keep our quarters clean and
everything like that.

DUNHAM: So who--the chaperones would enforce--?

TATE: Chaperones, yes.

DUNHAM: So what would happen if you didn&#039;t do right?

TATE: Well, they&#039;d put you on KP. You&#039;d go--and if you didn&#039;t do right in the
kitchen, you&#039;d go cut up those onions and cry! [laughing]

DUNHAM: So was living in the dorm--were you required to live in the dormitories?

TATE: Yes, yes. They were built for the defense workers.

DUNHAM: And were they right at the Puget Sound--that&#039;s where you [were]--Puget
Sound Shipyards?

TATE: It wasn&#039;t too far away. We could walk to work.

DUNHAM: You walked to work, okay. And what were some of the other rules then, of
the chaperones?

TATE: Well, we had certain times to be in bed, a certain time to bathe. You had
to take turns, because they didn&#039;t have that many shower stalls. And at certain
times to set up the tables, and everybody was assigned different things. But you
didn&#039;t do it all the time. They&#039;d move you around.

DUNHAM: And what were your living quarters like?

TATE: It was nice.

DUNHAM: Like a lot of beds in one room?

TATE: A lot of beds in one room and the shower stalls--and when you weren&#039;t used
to people watching you taking a shower. To me--that&#039;s the hardest thing for me,
because I had never been around where people watch you taking a shower. Then I
had to get used to it, because we never were without your clothes on in front of
anybody, not at my house either. My brothers always had to have a shirt on, and
I had never seen my dad in his pajamas. When my dad went to bed he put his
pajamas on. When he&#039;d get up in the morning, he would put his clothes on. That
was the way we were brought [up]. One of my friends at JC Penney&#039;s couldn&#039;t
understand it. She asked me, &quot;Well, how could you deal with that?&quot; I said that&#039;s
the way we were raised. The boys had to respect the girls and everything,
because you couldn&#039;t walk around without your clothes on.

DUNHAM: Did you say anything when you first encountered this?

TATE: No, I kept it to myself, because I didn&#039;t want them to know that that&#039;s
the way I was brought up.

DUNHAM: Were your girlfriends from New Orleans, did they have a similar upbringing?

TATE: No.

DUNHAM: No, they were not as uncomfortable.

TATE: No. They were used to swearing and things. We never did swear in our
house. That used to get next to me because my dad never used a swear word.

DUNHAM: So had you been exposed to that already being around them in New
Orleans, or was it just in--?

TATE: No, when I got used to being around them so much and hearing this, you
know, I was just--oh my gosh, I couldn&#039;t understand. Every home was different,
because my dad, when we&#039;d come home from school, the kids used to wonder, did he
ever talk? Because they would see him reading on the porch all the time. I said,
&quot;Yeah, he talks. When he talks, it&#039;s final and everything like that.&quot; Because my
brothers, they had to obey him and everything.

DUNHAM: What kind of things would he be reading, do you know?

TATE: He read the Bible lots. And one thing I used to notice when he&#039;d get a
paper, the funny papers was the first thing he read before he read the news. I
watched him do that.

DUNHAM: Did you read the paper or the funny papers yourself?

TATE: No, no. We got into our books. We had to study every evening. When you&#039;d
come home, after all your chores were done, it was time for studying.

DUNHAM: What were your chores?

TATE: Washing dishes, helping in the kitchen, and making the beds. At that time
everybody used springs on their bed, and it used to have the bedbugs and stuff.
You had to know how to take care of that with--

DUNHAM: The bed what?

TATE: Bedbugs, you know.

DUNHAM: Oh, okay. How did you take care of them?

TATE: Well, we&#039;d take the springs out and wash them down and everything, and
then take kerosene and rub on them.

DUNHAM: Did you have an indoor shower and bathroom?

TATE: No, we had tin tubs. We had to heat the water to take your bath in it.

DUNHAM: Okay, okay. So had you also not had a shower before you went to these dorms?

TATE: No.

DUNHAM: So that was new too.

TATE: That&#039;s what I was telling you, yeah.

DUNHAM: Not just the group aspect but everything.

TATE: No, because that&#039;s what I couldn&#039;t understand. But I got used to it.

DUNHAM: And you said, already, the dorms were integrated? Or within the bed
areas and shower, everything?

TATE: Yeah, everything was integrated over there.

DUNHAM: And were there any challenges with that? Did any things come up?

TATE: We had good chaperones. They kept things orderly.

DUNHAM: Were they all white, the chaperones?

TATE: Yes, everybody had to listen, and everything, to them. So, in order to
stay there, you had to do exactly what they would ask you to do.

DUNHAM: Did they treat blacks and whites differently in any ways?

TATE: No, because like I told you, they picked me out to be the head of the dormitory.

DUNHAM: Okay, so I know you had older women there, older than you.

TATE: Oh yeah!

DUNHAM: Did any of them, or the whites in particular, give you a hard time?

TATE: No, no. Everybody--

DUNHAM: They were all kind of upset with you.

TATE: Because everybody was working--and I guess they all were away from home
and they were trying to do the best that they could among each other. Yeah, so
it was okay and everything. I thought about those days too, because that was my
first time leaving home.

DUNHAM: Okay, yeah--what else about--were you homesick?

TATE: No, not really. It was a different way of living, so I had to do exactly
what was told to be done. And we had good chaperones. They set the rules when
you got there and then you follow them. Everybody had to do what they have asked
you to do, so we did that.

DUNHAM: Well, what about dealing with race? Your dad said to beware of a wolf in
sheep&#039;s clothing. Did that caution come true in ways, or were there--how did--?

TATE: Yeah, because we had--when we would go out, naturally the blacks would be
among each other. You know, in places and things like that. But then you watched
things, different how people react and staring at you, and you knew exactly if
they were doing the right thing or the wrong thing. So we were taught--my dad
always told us to pay attention to people, and then he says to us, too, it
doesn&#039;t go by the color of their skins, it&#039;s their character. So we went on that.

DUNHAM: So were there any specific examples from when you went out of how things
came up?

TATE: No, we knew the bad guys from the good ones. I did, because of the way
they would react. We watched things.

DUNHAM: And so is this at work?

TATE: At work and after, because if they respect you, then you know they came
from a good family. But when they say anything in front of you and act--and you
knew not to be around that, you know, just have a way of moving away from it.

DUNHAM: So what types of things did you encounter, I guess at work, that were
challenging in those ways?

TATE: No, nothing at work because most of the time we were on the machines, and
then for lunchtime, we had a half an hour. And when you go home you had work to
do there, and then you take a shower and go to bed.

DUNHAM: So what was the makeup of your work crew?

TATE: What do you mean?

DUNHAM: Like race, gender, or where they were from.

TATE: Oh, they were from all over! You had all types of people, and you knew the
good from the bad. I know I did because we were taught how to read people.

DUNHAM: Just by what they said?

TATE: What they say and how they react towards you and everything like that.

DUNHAM: Aside from the one good friend you made from Wisconsin, did you--what
kind of interactions did you have with other folks?

TATE: Folks--well, all right. I&#039;ve always been a type that--I&#039;d speak to people
and if they&#039;re friendly to me, I&#039;m friendly to you, something like that. But I
never was a rebellious-type person. Never. Even now. Everybody--they call me
Mother Tate. &quot;How could you be so nice and kind to people?&quot; Well, this is the
way I am. And everybody wants, &quot;I want to be like Mother Tate.&quot; [laughing]
Things like that. Even kids used to call home to talk to my kids, they&#039;d say,
&quot;Your mother talks so nice and kind.&quot; They&#039;d say, &quot;No, but you should be at home
with us.&quot; [laughing] Well, I sometimes I raised my voice to straighten them out.

DUNHAM: You had some of your father&#039;s strictness too.

TATE: Yeah, yeah.

DUNHAM: Well, what about with your bosses? Did you have, sometimes--

TATE: No. I listen and go do what I have to do.

DUNHAM: How was your work reviewed or evaluated?

TATE: Very good, because I got so--I was so good at the machine that he would
have me set up other people that would come in, like new people come in, I would
go set them up.

DUNHAM: So what did that entail, setting them up? What do you do to do that?

TATE: You show them what to do, the material used, and how to set their machine
up and how to gauge your threads from the things like measurements.

DUNHAM: So you took to it very well and helped train people. I&#039;ve heard
sometimes people had a hard time doing the work, or what--?

TATE: Oh yeah, they had--sometimes they did, because it&#039;s new to them. And I
know how if things are new you have to take your time with them to say, &quot;You can
do it.&quot; And then, &quot;Try, keep trying.&quot; And at the end they got it all, like
they&#039;re supposed to.

Yeah, even with my teaching, even in North Carolina, I taught people that had
never read in their lives. I had a sixty-two-year-old lady. My mother-in-law had
told me that she couldn&#039;t read or write, but she didn&#039;t want anybody to know it.
And I got to her and told her nobody would know it, because see, I went through
the Literacy Council and they didn&#039;t want you to go into the homes. They had
places set up for you, like at the church and the library, but I went to her
home she was hard to teach. I prayed many days that I could keep going and
helping her. I would teach her the alphabet, and the next day she would forget
it. So she said, &quot;You know, only one thing I want you to do--teach me to write
my name.&quot; And we worked days till she got that. And she was going to a social
place to get her check and she always made an X, so she told me that the morning
after she had really got it down, she says, &quot;I don&#039;t make x&#039;s anymore.&quot; So when
she wrote her name, they called everybody that knew her to come in and she
cried. I was crying too! [laughing] To see the joy! So--[voice breaking]

DUNHAM: Well, you were a teacher from such a young age. At the shipyards did you
encounter that as well? Did you help people learn to read or write there?

TATE: No.

DUNHAM: Not at Bremerton, okay.

TATE: This is in North Carolina and even in New Orleans before I left. You know,
I told you my minister--

DUNHAM: Yeah, we talked about that. North Carolina was in the eighties and nineties?

TATE: I went there in &#039;85 and I worked for the Literacy Council, and then I
would go to the community places and these were kids that were Hmongs and came
from other places and I&#039;d read to them and stuff like that.

DUNHAM: At the shipyards in Bremerton were there any Asian Americans or Mexican
Americans or others?

TATE: In Bremerton, Wash[ington]?

DUNHAM: Yeah, do you remember if there were?

TATE: I am sure there were.

DUNHAM: Well, or working at the--either.

TATE: Oh working, yeah. There were Asian Americans, all kinds at the shipyards.
Yeah, you had everybody there working.

DUNHAM: And had you--so well, did you have any time for fun or to go out exploring?

TATE: Yeah, we&#039;d go--

DUNHAM: Okay, what did you do then?

TATE: On the weekend they would let us go out. We&#039;d go to church and stuff. In
fact, it was a military base close by. We would go to services there and they
would invite us to lunch. I never saw so much fried chicken in all my life!
[laughing] And we would eat lunch there with the soldiers and everything, and
then a lot of times--I had never been to a nightclub before--and we went to this
place. It was Jack Teagarden and Louis Armstrong.

DUNHAM: Oh wow!

TATE: And we went to see them perform and that&#039;s the first time I&#039;d ever seen a
live thing like that.

DUNHAM: What was that like?

TATE: It was really nice. I really enjoyed that. But we had a certain time to
get home and everything, so we did.

DUNHAM: Did you have any voice of your father in your head that you weren&#039;t
supposed to be there?

TATE: Oh yeah, yeah.

DUNHAM: Were you okay?

TATE: Yeah, yeah, because--and we met guys and they would try to talk a hole in
your head, but you don&#039;t have to bother with them and go home.

DUNHAM: Okay. Did you go to dances?

TATE: Yeah, at home we used to put on little shows in the home, my brothers and sisters.

DUNHAM: Oh yeah?

TATE: Yeah, we used to have--when my dad and mom wasn&#039;t home we would have a
show in there.

DUNHAM: So you couldn&#039;t even do that if they were home?

TATE: Oh no. He didn&#039;t care too much for dancing. He liked--all the things were
mostly singing religious songs and studying. That&#039;s the way my dad was.

DUNHAM: So what kind of music would you dance to back in the home?

TATE: Everything! We had--what&#039;s his name--Cab Calloway. We had--well, we did
have a little record player at home. He would let us play that sometimes, but we
couldn&#039;t play it often. That&#039;s just when friends come over or something. And I
played the piano just a little, and I had a boyfriend that played the piano and
everybody would come and sit in the living room. You had no privacy. Everybody
would come in if you had company, you&#039;d sit and sing and play the piano.

DUNHAM: So this was in high school when you were--?

TATE: It was after high school.

DUNHAM: So what was it like dating then?

TATE: Well, it was like dating the family. That&#039;s the way it was.

DUNHAM: Okay, so you&#039;d never--you never went out on a date just the two of you?

TATE: Oh no, no. My dad was very strict.

DUNHAM: But he was--but you considered him a boyfriend.

TATE: Oh yeah, he let us have friends come to the house, but they would come in
the living room and sit with us.

DUNHAM: I see, all right. Well, when you--so when you&#039;re in Bremerton, what was
it like when you went out to the dances then? Were they USO dances?

TATE: No, we had--well, we&#039;d dance and everything. We had what, the jitterbug at
that time. You know how they threw them--nobody was dancing close, they were
just, that&#039;s--

DUNHAM: And were they segregated dances?

TATE: Yes, oh yeah, it was.

DUNHAM: Were the shops and different things, were they segregated mostly in Washington?

TATE: I don&#039;t think so. We were there to work in the shipyard.

DUNHAM: But outside of the work? When you went out?

TATE: Outside of work everybody would separate themselves. You know how, it&#039;s just--

DUNHAM: So that was more similar than different from New Orleans? Or were there differences?

TATE: Well, the differences were we were together at one time, but when work was
over everybody went their separate ways. The blacks were with the blacks and the
whites with the whites.

DUNHAM: And were there places where you knew you weren&#039;t allowed to go?

TATE: Well, we didn&#039;t go too many places. In Bremerton there just wasn&#039;t many
places to go to.

DUNHAM: Okay, and were you in Bremerton the whole--you were there two and a half years?

TATE: Yeah, the whole time. Sometimes--I think several times we went into
Seattle and things like that, but we had a lot of guys that came from Canada
that were there and they used to call us--they had a name for us because we were
from New Orleans. I&#039;ve forgotten what it was.

DUNHAM: The Canadian--there were Canadian guys who worked--?

TATE: Black guys from Canada.

DUNHAM: Oh, okay.

TATE: Yeah.

DUNHAM: And so did you--were you doing any dating then?

TATE: No.

DUNHAM: And so do you remember what it was like when you went to Seattle?

TATE: Yeah, it was hilly and damp.

DUNHAM: Did you go to any clubs?

TATE: No. And on the street people, were surprised if you&#039;d speak to them. I was
facing a lady coming toward me and I said, &quot;Good morning.&quot; She said, &quot;Where are
you from?&quot; Because she said people don&#039;t speak to you. Well, that was the way we
were brought up. You spoke to people, good morning or good evening to them. So I
was still doing what I always did, you know?

DUNHAM: Sure. Did that change at all for you?

TATE: No, I stayed the same, but she was so shocked that I&#039;d speak! People don&#039;t
speak to anybody. What a world. At least you could say hello.

DUNHAM: Yeah, certainly. Well, I&#039;ve read about an organization called the Puget
Sound Civic Society. Had you heard of that?

TATE: I didn&#039;t know about them.

DUNHAM: There was a woman named Lillian Walker who--it was around the issue of
businesses that had signs We Cater to White Trade Only.

TATE: No, let&#039;s see--

DUNHAM: It was in about &#039;44 though. Maybe you had--

TATE: No, I was in San Francisco in--

DUNHAM: By then, okay.

TATE: By then.

DUNHAM: But certainly indicated that there was, I guess as you said, still quite
a bit of segregation.

TATE: Yeah, because even in Richmond it was segregated, you know. When you&#039;d get
on a bus, I remember incidents, if you were sitting down and whites get on, they
want you to get up. And I witnessed a thing--we were sitting down and they had
one black lady get up, and when she got up the white man sat down, and she sat
in his lap. They had to stop the bus and get off! [laughing]

DUNHAM: Wait, what happened?

TATE: She sat on his lap. So they stopped the bus, because there would have been
a fight on there.

DUNHAM: I mean stopped the--was there not a fight? No? They avoided a fight?

TATE: No, the bus driver put her off for doing that thing.

DUNHAM: He pulled her off. Wow.

TATE: Yeah, yeah, because you had to get up and give the whites the seats.

DUNHAM: Were you on that bus?

TATE: I was on there. I was standing up looking at everything, you know, holding
on to the pole.

DUNHAM: Wow. But they only made her get off.

TATE: Yeah, but she sat--she had a seat. See, when we got on she was already
sitting. So--

DUNHAM: Right. Was she upset then? Did she--?

TATE: Oh yes, she was upset when they told her to get up. She got up and then
she sat right on his lap and it was--it was the funniest thing, but they put her
off the bus. [laughing]

DUNHAM: Wow.

TATE: There are so many things you don&#039;t remember, but it comes back to you. But
I remember it so well. It was right in Richmond, California.

DUNHAM: Did anyone else say anything, do you know?

TATE: No. Nobody said anything. It was really something.

And in New Orleans, we had incidents, even in high school, which0020was situated
on Rampart Street. My principal would stand on the corner, because the red-light
district was to the right, so he would make us go the other way to get home. And
we had friends in our class that lived in the French Quarter and they could
pass, so they were blondes, brunettes, and everything else. So when we&#039;d get on
the streetcar they would have the sign where you only have about two seats left
and all the other seats are empty, those girls would go up there and take a
seat. They&#039;d pass for white. But we had to stand up. That was in high school.

DUNHAM: Were there other ways in which they were able to pass, beyond just
sitting on the bus?

TATE: Yeah, some of them came out here and was passing too, getting big, nice
jobs and things.

DUNHAM: So what were the different kinds of opportunities being able to pass or not?

TATE: Well, they could get better jobs. Like we had Woolworth&#039;s. In fact, there
was one girl in our machine shop, she looked like a white girl, and she would
say she was working at--we called them five-and-ten-cent stores at that time,
and she said she was invited to the whites&#039; house. They thought she was white.
And she said all they talked about was the blacks. And she says--and here she
was listening to all this and she was black too, but she said she had to go
along with it, you know. She says it&#039;s really--because we hadn&#039;t experienced
anything. She would tell us all about this stuff that she was experiencing, for
passing and everything, and got a chance to work at the dime store where we
couldn&#039;t work there. You&#039;d put in an application, but it was thrown in the garbage.

DUNHAM: Could you go to the dime store as a customer?

TATE: Oh yeah, you can go--

DUNHAM: But you couldn&#039;t work there.

TATE: You can go and buy and everything, because even when I was working at JC
Penney&#039;s right here in California, you would find you&#039;d run into things like
that too.

DUNHAM: Years later.

TATE: I was in management and you had to have a certain code to get out on the
phone, and it was a white lady who came in and they called me up to okay her
check. And she said, &quot;No, she&#039;s not.&quot; So she picked up the phone and she said,
&quot;I&#039;m going to call my maid at home.&quot; And we knew she couldn&#039;t get out because
she didn&#039;t know our code to get out, and she acted like she was talking to her
maid and all this kind of nonsense. I went through a lot when I was in
management at JC Penney&#039;s, right here in California.

DUNHAM: Sure. What city did you work in?

TATE: Over here in Daly City.

DUNHAM: So--wow. Well, so back in--so Bremer[ton], you said you stayed in the
dormitories the whole time?

TATE: Yeah, we stayed in the dormitory the whole time because that was the only
place we could live to work. They had made a preparation for the workers to come
to Bremerton.

DUNHAM: Were you not--you couldn&#039;t have lived--did some of the workers [live] in
other residences?

TATE: Well, the only one I knew who lived off was this girl and her brother.
They got a place together and we used to go cook at their place.

DUNHAM: Right, and they were black?

TATE: Yeah, they were black.

DUNHAM: And did they have any trouble finding a place as--was it hard in terms of--?

TATE: Well, see we never--we never even asked about it. We were so glad that we
had a place to go to. So we didn&#039;t know how they got the place or not. Yeah, it
was two--just brothers and sisters together and they got a place, so we can all
go cook at their place. I remember that.

DUNHAM: Did you join a union?

TATE: No, but I had never--like income tax, taking out money--I didn&#039;t want them
to take any because I didn&#039;t know what they were talking about, you know, at
that time.

DUNHAM: Okay, oh--so they had a union but you had the option?

TATE: No, this is for--to pay taxes on our income. I never paid income tax in my
life! You know, I was young then and I wondered why they want to take my money. [laughing]

DUNHAM: When you went to pay taxes.

TATE: So my boss said, &quot;As long as you work they&#039;re going to be taking money out
of your check.&quot; But it was new to me. So I said--that was the only thing I was
questioning about. Why take my money? I&#039;m working for it. Well, I had to pay
income tax. I didn&#039;t know that.

DUNHAM: And two of your brothers were drafted by this time?

TATE: Yeah.

DUNHAM: So were you following news of the war?

TATE: No, because we didn&#039;t--we knew where they were. My dad and mom would let
us know the different places where they were. And they came home--they couldn&#039;t
get jobs or anything either.

DUNHAM: When was that? After the war?

TATE: That was after the war.

DUNHAM: They came back to New Orleans?

TATE: Came back to New Orleans, they couldn&#039;t--

DUNHAM: So how did they make do?

TATE: Well, they had to just take any kind of job, like going to the golf course
and being a caddy or something like that or working in the yards cleaning up
yards and gardening--mowing the lawn.

DUNHAM: Were they able to use the GI Bill at all?

TATE: No, they never used any of that. Not like my son used the GI--now, Jimmy
went back to school. He got his master&#039;s degree. That&#039;s here, lately, you know,
because he was in the Air Force.

DUNHAM: Right, much later. So over the course of your time at Puget Sound, did
the makeup of the workforce change?

TATE: No, I left because the girls left. They saw in the paper that they were
hiring in San Francisco at the Navy Shipyard, so they left me.

DUNHAM: How long were they there about?

TATE: They were there about--I guess almost a year, because Mama told me to
leave from there by myself, and my sister had moved to Richmond doing defense
work at Kaiser Shipyards. She and her family was there. She said, &quot;Go stay with
your sister Jan.&quot; So when I went to Richmond I didn&#039;t--

DUNHAM: Well, how long did you stay after your friends left?

TATE: I think I stayed--oh, just almost a year I think.

DUNHAM: So maybe--two years, okay, total.

TATE: Something like that. And then--

DUNHAM: I didn&#039;t ask too, before we go to Richmond, did you--so the white woman
who you had lunch with and stuff, did you ever go out with her outside of work?

TATE: No, just right there. Just right there--then my friends were angry with me because--

DUNHAM: Just for even hanging out with her there.

TATE: With her, yeah. And I said, &quot;No, that&#039;s my friend.&quot;

DUNHAM: Would it ever have been a consideration to go out with her outside of work?

TATE: No. We never discussed that.

DUNHAM: And was she religious?

TATE: Now, I don&#039;t know whether she was or not, but she was a very nice person.
We would sit and eat lunch and she wanted to find out about the blacks because
she had never been around, other than what she saw in a movie.

DUNHAM: And what was your church like there? Was it a lot different from home?

TATE: We didn&#039;t really go hardly to too many churches there. We went to the
church there on base, you know, the base was there. We went to their church and
everything. And then some Sundays we just didn&#039;t go to church at all. We went to
visit one church I think, one Sunday we did. But my friends, they weren&#039;t church
people. And see if I had to go, I had to go by myself or somebody else off of
the job.

DUNHAM: Did you miss that?

TATE: I missed going to church, because I had been going every Sunday from when
I was at home. I just couldn&#039;t--just couldn&#039;t find friends enough that would do
things like that, but they didn&#039;t mind staying around doing nothing, but I used
to--that&#039;s one thing I missed about that. But when I came to San Francisco I
found churches to go to and things like that.

DUNHAM: And you had been--you were sending money home.

TATE: To my parents.

DUNHAM: And then what did you do with the rest of your paycheck? Were you able
to save some, or--?

TATE: I saved some for myself, you know, to buy my clothes and shoes and stuff
like that, but not a lot of big things.

DUNHAM: Did you have to buy your own work clothes?

TATE: Oh yeah. We worked--well, we had--not special work clothes. You worked
in--you had jeans or pants, something like that and a shirt. And then we would
have an apron they would give us because of the oil.

DUNHAM: Because of the--

TATE: Oil. A lot of oil you put on the machine.

DUNHAM: Oh, oil, yeah okay.

TATE: It would splash, that oil, so you had to have an apron. Everybody had an
apron when they&#039;d go in.

DUNHAM: How were injuries handled?

TATE: Well, I don&#039;t remember any injuries. I don&#039;t remember.

DUNHAM: Okay. Did you ever have any close calls?

TATE: No, you were careful because everything--those blades were sharp and you
had to be very careful. They stressed that a lot when we were trained. And so we
had to be careful of that.

DUNHAM: Did they have a swing and graveyard shift?

TATE: Not that I know of. We only went in the day shift. I don&#039;t know if they
had a swing shift or not, but we had--mine was day shift, eight to four thirty.

DUNHAM: Was there a sense of patriotism there? Did they have any events during
lunch or that kind of thing that you noticed?

TATE: No, not that I remember.

DUNHAM: Did you go to the movies and see the newsreels or that type of thing?

TATE: No, because I wasn&#039;t used to going to movies at home. So I didn&#039;t bother
about that.

DUNHAM: What about rationing? Did that affect you?

TATE: At home we had rationing, so I was in line--like I told you.

DUNHAM: Oh right, okay.

TATE: I didn&#039;t want to be in line.

DUNHAM: But that was before the war or it was during the war?

TATE: That was--I think that was just before the war. Yeah.

Rosboro: That&#039;s when she had to be pressured to get in line for the rations.

DUNHAM: Oh okay, right, when you would have--but during the war when they also,
when they limited items so you had coupons, further restrictions.

TATE: We had further things, yeah, because we used to have certain things--I
remember they had horse meat at the time in cans, and my older sister, I don&#039;t
know how she knew about it, but she would make a salad, like a chicken salad,
with it. Yeah, we thought it was delicious!

DUNHAM: Okay, very well. Well, before we talk about your coming down to the Bay
Area then, is there anything else about your experience in the Northwest that we
didn&#039;t cover?

TATE: Not really. It was mostly for working purpose.

DUNHAM: And do you remember--did you get any raises while you were there? And do
you know if you were paid the same as white women or men doing the same work?

TATE: We didn&#039;t know that. We didn&#039;t know that.

DUNHAM: Yeah, because you talked about, of course, the different opportunities
at different places, but you didn&#039;t have a sense of that.

TATE: No, we didn&#039;t--in fact, we were too glad to get a check, because we had
never worked before. And so I never questioned anything like that, you know.
Even if you did, I don&#039;t know.

DUNHAM: So when your friends left, did that--how did that affect you? Who did
you hang out with?

TATE: Well, I had met lots of people there on the job, so I was still friendly
with the ones that were left there. But my mother didn&#039;t want me there by myself
because she knew I was with the other girls when I left, and I told them that
they had gone. Well, I guess she started worrying about me, yeah, so--but I had
met people that were very nice to me and everything. And my chaperones were very
good to me. They were nice.

DUNHAM: Did you go back and forth at all? Or were you there that entire time?

TATE: I just stayed there the whole time.

DUNHAM: Yeah, so how were holidays?

TATE: Holidays, well, we just--I guess we just got together and would sit around
and talk. It wasn&#039;t very much like a home life thing. You&#039;re just away from home
and trying to do the best you can and everything, so that&#039;s the way it was with us.

DUNHAM: Okay. So tell me then now about when you came down to Richmond, I guess
that was--

TATE: Yeah, when I came to Richmond and I went to my sister&#039;s house. But I
didn&#039;t like Richmond. Because see Bremerton and Seattle, that part, it was nice
there. But to come to Richmond, I didn&#039;t particularly care for the looks of
Richmond. They had a lot of project homes and stuff. So I told my sister I was
going to go check out the navy shipyard where my friends were, I knew they were there.

DUNHAM: Just to back up, sorry, a second. So with Richmond, partly it was the
overpopulation, if you will. It had gone from 20,000 to 120,000, so just--

TATE: My sister--she had a big family. She had seven children.

DUNHAM: Oh okay, where were they living?

TATE: They were living with her.

DUNHAM: But where--?

TATE: In Richmond.

DUNHAM: But where, do you recall?

TATE: I forget the--

DUNHAM: In a temporary housing project?

TATE: Yeah, temporary, before--did I tell you my dad built a place for them?

DUNHAM: That was later?

TATE: Later, yeah. They were living in project homes. Yeah, that&#039;s where they
were. And then when my dad built the place, laid the foundation for them, then
they moved in, because the husband was working--he was working helping building
the highways. He was making pretty good money, because my sister was working in
the shipyard, and then her husband started working for the highways and stuff,
so he had enough money that he could start building a place.

DUNHAM: What did your sister do at the shipyards?

TATE: I don&#039;t know what kind of work she did, because I never did go to the navy shipyard.

DUNHAM: To the Kaiser Shipyards?

TATE: Yeah, Kaiser--

DUNHAM: But that&#039;s what she and your mom maybe wanted you to do was go--?

TATE: No, see that&#039;s what Mom wanted me to do, to stay and go get a job where
she was. But then I found out where the A-train was and I told my sister I was
going to go check out the place where my friends were. And so she said okay, so
I got on the A-train and found my way to the navy shipyard and got hired the
same day! So they had dormitories built for workers there too.

DUNHAM: Oh, they did?

TATE: Yeah, so I got the job there and then I got a place at the dormitory.

DUNHAM: Well, tell me more detail about applying for that job, because you told
me when we talked before--

TATE: When I applied for the job--when I went they told me I wasn&#039;t going to get
the job, because it was sweeping the yards out.

DUNHAM: Who told you that?

TATE: My friends. All of them were out with brooms sweeping the yard. And I
said, &quot;Well, I&#039;m going to go in and put in an application.&quot; So I did and when I
went in, I will never forget this guy. He was Italian, named Giulio. He gave me
a blueprint and he put me at a machine. He says, &quot;Now, when I come back I&#039;ll
check your measurements.&quot; He did, so he said, &quot;You&#039;ve got a job.&quot; So they were
waiting for me to come out on the yard, but I never did go--so they came in to
look for me and they said, &quot;How did you get your job?&quot; I said, &quot;Because while
you all were goofing off, I was paying attention.&quot;

DUNHAM: Back up in Bremerton?

TATE: Yeah, in Bremerton.

DUNHAM: Because they worked there too, but you&#039;re saying they didn&#039;t--?

TATE: They worked, they got the same training I had.

DUNHAM: But they didn&#039;t take it as seriously?

TATE: No.

DUNHAM: But they did all right there? They kept their jobs in Bremerton?

TATE: They did. They kept the job there, but then when--they didn&#039;t really get
into it. Because I wanted to learn everything about what I was doing and more.
And then they could go by how much you were producing when you were on a
machine. So that&#039;s what I did, we made tubs of bolts.

DUNHAM: Yeah, so did you--did they have competitions at all for who would
produce the most?

TATE: No, it was just that they would check you out and they&#039;d know who was
working and who wasn&#039;t working.

DUNHAM: Okay, but none of them lost their jobs.

TATE: No, they didn&#039;t lose their job. They decided they wanted to leave, so they
all got together and left me.

DUNHAM: Did they give you any more money for doing more? Or was it just--?

TATE: No, it was just--we just got a regular check.

DUNHAM: You said--and to learn and do better. Did you have to ask questions of
different people to--?

TATE: No. The ones--see, they would come around and check your machine and check
you out, and then if you had questions you would ask them then. So I wanted to
know everything about what I was doing, and I did. And then I told you--I was so
good that he had me setting up people that came in later to the machines.

So anyway, I got a ticket. My mom wanted me to leave. I went to Richmond, I
didn&#039;t like it, and that was while I was at the shipyard we were talking about.
So anyway, I had the job and I kept that job for quite a while, until most of
the men were leaving to go to the war and they needed people for the municipal
railway, and I read about that, so I applied for a conductorette job.

DUNHAM: Can I ask you a little more about Hunter&#039;s Point first? I definitely
want to hear about that, but--so were you the only African American in your area
working on--?

TATE: No, no.

DUNHAM: No? There were others.

TATE: It was mixed. We were all mixed up there.

DUNHAM: Okay, because--so there were other blacks who already worked there, but
your friends just--had they tried to take the test, do you know?

TATE: Oh, you mean at the navy shipyard?

DUNHAM: Yeah, yeah. At Hunter&#039;s Point.

TATE: They went--sure, everybody would go in. They have to take the test.

DUNHAM: Okay, so they took the test but didn&#039;t do well enough.

TATE: And they didn&#039;t pass.

DUNHAM: And they had to do janitorial work.

TATE: That&#039;s right.

DUNHAM: All right, but you--okay, so you weren&#039;t--?

TATE: I worked on a machine, while our friends were outside.

DUNHAM: And how did it compare with the work you&#039;d done in Bremerton? Was it--

TATE: It was about the same thing, you know, because all your lathe machines are
the same way and we worked with a material called Monel. They were working with
that too, making the bolts and things out of Monel material.

DUNHAM: What was different, if anything, about working at Hunter&#039;s Point?

TATE: Well, at Hunter&#039;s Point it was--it wasn&#039;t--they had more people. It was a
huge shop that we worked in at Hunter&#039;s Point. And then again, I met lots of
other folk at the dormitories, because you didn&#039;t have the same people that you
were with. You got to be friendly with lots of different ones that lived in the
dormitories, because we--

DUNHAM: Were the dorms there integrated or were they segregated?

TATE: No, they were segregated.

DUNHAM: At Hunter&#039;s Point.

TATE: Yeah, Hunter&#039;s Point.

DUNHAM: So that was different.

TATE: Yeah, you had your one set for the blacks and one--and then they were
separated with women and men. Yeah, you had--

DUNHAM: Well, that was the same at Bremerton, I assume.

TATE: The same thing yeah.

DUNHAM: Were you surprised that Bremerton was integrated in the dorms?

TATE: I was, really, because we didn&#039;t know that we would work together, but we did.

DUNHAM: So San Francisco, you&#039;re living right there in the dorms at Hunter&#039;s
Point or did you get--?

TATE: At Hunter&#039;s Point, right. It was outside the yard the dorms were built.

DUNHAM: Was it just as restrictive in terms of a chaperone and that type of thing?

TATE: No, you were on your own there.

DUNHAM: Okay, no chaperones.

TATE: No chaperones. It was just like you were renting a room or an apartment or
something. We didn&#039;t have chaperones there.

DUNHAM: Did you like that?

TATE: Yeah, I liked it because I was supposed to have been grown then, you know.

DUNHAM: How old are you now, at this time?

TATE: At this time I was in my early twenties I guess then. Yeah, in my early twenties.

DUNHAM: So what did you do with your new independence?

TATE: Well, then I would be able to go to different clubs and things. I would
go--and I would join a church there and then I would put in a lot of time at
church and stuff like that.

DUNHAM: Which church?

TATE: A Baptist church. I forget the name of it. It was close by, everything,
because we had no cars or anything. Most things was walking distance of where we were.

DUNHAM: And what about the clubs? Do you remember what clubs you went to?

TATE: Yeah, we went--there was one on Third Street, not too far away. It
was--that&#039;s where I met the kids&#039; dad. I met him. He was a bartender there.

DUNHAM: Oh wow!

TATE: And I told him that I didn&#039;t drink. So he would make my drinks up like it
was alcohol. He&#039;d put the oranges and the olives on it, and my friends that I
was with thought that I was drinking, but I wasn&#039;t drinking. [laughing]

DUNHAM: Did you ever drink?

TATE: Later on I&#039;d drink a little, but not too much. I never did care too much
for the alcohol anyway.

DUNHAM: So he was the bartender there.

TATE: Bartender, and I told him to fix me a drink and then I told him don&#039;t put
any alcohol in, so that&#039;s how I met him.

DUNHAM: So you wanted to pretend to your friends that you were drinking?

TATE: Yeah, sort of the same thing.

DUNHAM: Because they would give you a hard time?

TATE: Well, you know that, you know? Yeah, so they thought I was drinking the
same as they were, but I wasn&#039;t.

DUNHAM: So how did you--?

TATE: I met him--he was thirteen years older than me, but he was very nice and
everything, so we got to be very good friends. And he started coming and picking
me up and taking me out to dinner and stuff like that.

DUNHAM: What were some of the places you would go out to, do you remember?

TATE: We would go to different restaurants for eating and things like that. A
couple of movies or something. Yeah.

DUNHAM: Was he the first guy you dated?

TATE: That was my first boyfriend. Yeah. So we went together--I guess a couple
of years or more and he asked me would I marry him, because he wasn&#039;t married or
anything. The Rosborough family. My kids are Rosboroughs, yes, out of Texas. And
their uncle [Garfield A. Rosborough] was a principal in the high school there in
Marshall, Texas. So my husband had gone to the military. He was out then. Now,
he didn&#039;t serve but four years and then he was out.

DUNHAM: So he got out during the war?

TATE: Yeah.

DUNHAM: Or before the war ended?

TATE: Yeah, before it ended he was there.

DUNHAM: And did your--when did you let your dad know you were dating a
bartender? [laughing]

TATE: I told my dad--I didn&#039;t tell him what he was. So my dad had a chance to
meet him after--my dad liked him. He was very respectable. He came from a good
family, and most of his side of the family were educators, but he and his two
brothers they weren&#039;t, but they went to school, high school. Never went to
college or anything, but they were taught how to treat people and everything
like that.

DUNHAM: Okay. And would you guys go out dancing?

TATE: Yeah. He wasn&#039;t a dancer. He was a wallflower. [laughing]

DUNHAM: Okay. Did you go out dancing in the city at all?

TATE: Because see, I learned how to dance at home. My brothers used to teach us
how to dance. When my dad wasn&#039;t home we would dance and stuff. But my dad knew
that my brothers, when they&#039;d go out they had girlfriends. They would go to
dances and things like that.

DUNHAM: So they were allowed to but you weren&#039;t allowed?

TATE: No, he didn&#039;t care--the girls were very protective and the boys were in a
way too, because he wouldn&#039;t let them stay out too late at night. You had to
come home. That&#039;s the way our household was. The boys had to be very respective
to the girls and stuff.

DUNHAM: Okay. I would like to do a little more, but do you want to take a break?
Do you need water or anything? [interruption in recording]

DUNHAM: All right, we&#039;re just resuming here with Mrs. Elizabeth Tate. So you&#039;re
working at the Hunter&#039;s [Point] Shipyard. You&#039;ve met your husband-to-be. How
long did you work at the Hunter&#039;s Point Shipyard?

TATE: I worked at Hunter&#039;s Point--I guess just about a year--about a year. And
when I heard that they were hiring for the municipal railway, then I went to be
a conductorette there. So I stayed.

DUNHAM: So what made you want to make that transition?

TATE: Well, changing jobs, you know. I wanted to do something different than
working in a machine shop.

DUNHAM: Was it similar wages?

TATE: More.

DUNHAM: It was more too! Oh! Well, that probably didn&#039;t hurt.

TATE: Yeah, no it didn&#039;t. So that&#039;s when I started working for the municipal
railway, and I was a conductorette at that time. It was very interesting and
everything. I liked meeting people.

DUNHAM: How did you get that job?

TATE: I applied for it, out at Geneva and San Jose Avenue at the car barn. You
go in and put in an application, so they hired me. It was quite a few young
people my age were working at the time, women, you know.

DUNHAM: African American women?

TATE: Yes.

DUNHAM: And white women too, or mixed?

TATE: Yeah, they had--they were white, men too. They had older white guys who
were working there. Because most of them were the motormen and we were conductorettes.

DUNHAM: So what does a conductorette do?

TATE: Collect the money and ring the bells to go and stop. So I had a changer, a
moneychanger on, and then a box that they&#039;d put the money in and if they didn&#039;t
have it I would make the change and give it to them.

DUNHAM: How much did it cost?

TATE: They would give us--I can&#039;t even think. I don&#039;t know how much they were
paying then, but a lot of times if they didn&#039;t have the correct amount we would
give them the change from the changer.

DUNHAM: Right, so you were ready to go. Okay. And so what was it like doing that?

TATE: It was really an interesting--you met all kinds of people. You&#039;d meet
people coming--there was one guy that would sing the whole while, go through
every car singing. And if you looked sad he&#039;d say, &quot;What in the hell is wrong
with you?&quot; That kind of stuff made everybody laugh. Early in the morning, they
were laughing--he was a fun guy that would get on and do all this kind of stuff.
But anyway, you met all kinds of people and some of them were friendly and some
weren&#039;t. You know how to treat them, they&#039;d get on.

DUNHAM: Yeah, you said you had one particularly--

TATE: Yeah, this guy would get on and--oh, you mean when I had the guy that
wanted to buy the streetcar? No--

DUNHAM: Yeah, do you want to tell us that?

TATE: Okay, he got on and he stayed in the back, because see the conductorettes
stay in the back and the motorman is in the front. So he stood there a long time
and then he says where he came from--he used the N word on me and said they
didn&#039;t do this kind of work there. And he said, &quot;Well, how much does the
streetcar cost?&quot; So I told him I didn&#039;t know. I said, &quot;If you want to buy it,
I&#039;ll tell you where to,&quot; and I wrote the name of the car barn on it, everything,
and gave it to him. But I didn&#039;t think he was going to want to buy it. He just
kept talking about where he came from, what they didn&#039;t do, and this, that, and
the other. So he did--I went in that evening and told them it was a guy going to
come buy the streetcar. And they said, &quot;Oh Elizabeth, you&#039;re just pulling our
leg.&quot; I said, &quot;No, he told me he was. I gave him the address.&quot;

And sure enough, he found his way there, and when he came in they all just
laughed at him and everything. So I don&#039;t know what happened after that, because
I had to check in and bring the money and go in a place where we&#039;d check in
everything. But they told me that they thought I was just kidding and he did
come. I saw him, when I was going into the room to turn in my money, you know. I
said my gosh, was he that crazy?

And the soldiers were bad. They&#039;d come on and they&#039;d take the bell from you and
they&#039;d start ringing and ringing. So the motorman would come, stop the street
car, and come and say, &quot;You guys are throwing me off. She rings it for what I&#039;m
supposed to be doing.&quot; And so they were all young soldiers, white soldiers and
everything. So then he told them, he had a crowbar in his hand. He couldn&#039;t do
anything with it, but he told them they&#039;d have to get off if they didn&#039;t do
right. So they did--some of them did get off.

DUNHAM: Was that type of thing, was that racially motivated do you think?

TATE: Yes, it was.

DUNHAM: It was too, okay.

TATE: Yeah, it was, because they couldn&#039;t stand to see me ringing the bell on
the--they wanted to do it. You know, that kind of stuff. But to me, I never said
anything, because I didn&#039;t want to get into trouble with any of them. So they
took it from me, I just let them have it, and the motorman knew what was going
on because he knew I wasn&#039;t back there, just pulling that bell for him.

DUNHAM: Did you ever feel scared in a situation like that?

TATE: Not really, not really.

DUNHAM: You&#039;d grown up in a challenging time and environment.

TATE: Right.

DUNHAM: But protected. But so now when you experienced that first-hand, how did
you feel?

TATE: Yes, right. I didn&#039;t feel afraid or anything, I guess. Because to me, I
was very religious, and so I just thought my protection came from above and
everything turned out okay for me. Because if you say a lot, say things, you
stir up lots of stuff, so the best thing is to keep quiet and don&#039;t say
anything. So that&#039;s what I did.

DUNHAM: So when you became the conductorette where did you live?

TATE: Well, I had an apartment.

DUNHAM: Because up until then you&#039;d been at the dormitory at Hunter&#039;s Point?

TATE: Yeah, and then when I had to move out I had to get a place of my own, so I
had to work to pay for where I was living.

DUNHAM: So where was that? Did you have any trouble finding it?

TATE: No, because they had built these projects where you can rent apartments
and stay there. So that&#039;s what I was doing.

DUNHAM: Specifically for working on the rail[way]?

TATE: Yeah, there were places you could not rent.

DUNHAM: Oh okay, so there was still employer-related--where were they?

TATE: Right. Hunter&#039;s Point. They called it the Hunter&#039;s Point area, you know,
so I moved out of the dorm and moved in one of the places there. They kept them
for a long time, and then they started tearing them down and building homes out there.

DUNHAM: So what was--living on your own in the apartment, what was that like?

TATE: Well, it was really nice, because then I had to buy things--my cooking
things. I cooked and everything, and my beddings and stuff like that. I had to
start from scratch, yeah, so I had to have money for that and everything. So
that&#039;s how I lived. My brother wanted me to come stay with them, but I didn&#039;t
want to. I wanted to be by myself.

DUNHAM: Were they in San Francisco?

TATE: Yeah, they called them projects too. They lived there too with their
families. I didn&#039;t have a family at the time, just myself.

DUNHAM: And you had started dating by then?

TATE: Yes, and I told you I met their father. So I had an apartment then when I
met him.

DUNHAM: Where did he live?

TATE: He lived in the city. His older brother had come to San Francisco and
bought an apartment house, which he rented out. That&#039;s how he made his money. So
we rented from him too.

DUNHAM: But you would go out and you were independent?

TATE: Oh yes.

DUNHAM: And how did you get around then?

TATE: We&#039;d catch the streetcar and the buses and things like that. Then later
on, after I married, then we bought a car and stuff and I had to learn how to
drive and everything.

DUNHAM: Did you work one particular streetcar line or various?

TATE: No, it was one particular--right from Geneva Avenue and San Jose. They
still have a car barn there now. Yeah, I worked from there on the--M-[Ocean
View] line. And in fact I&#039;d go on out to Market Street and back. I worked there
for quite a few years before I changed jobs again.

DUNHAM: So do you remember when you heard about the end of the war? V-E Day--?

TATE: I was on a street car. And everybody was screaming and hollering--and they
had some soldiers on there too. It was just like one big happy family,
everybody. They didn&#039;t care who you were. They were just shaking hands. I was
just so happy that it was over.

DUNHAM: And I didn&#039;t ask too--we were talking about it off-camera, but did you
hear about the Port Chicago explosion in &#039;44?

TATE: Yeah, my sister lived there in Richmond at the time during the problems
with Port Chicago.

DUNHAM: Yeah, the aftermath with the trial. Did you hear about it then?

TATE: No, I heard about how they were treated and things like that, but I never
did keep up with it after that, because I think my older sister knew--they knew
all about what was going on.

DUNHAM: Were you in San Francisco by this--?

TATE: Yes, I was in San Francisco.

DUNHAM: Okay, so you were.

TATE: Because I had left them in Richmond. I went to San Francisco.

DUNHAM: What do you remember of her--what she would tell you?

TATE: About the blacks and things that they were doing to them there at the--

DUNHAM: What were her experiences like at the Richmond shipyard? Did she talk
about that at all and any challenges she had there?

TATE: No, she didn&#039;t because with her seven children she was working to rush
home because she had to take care of her family too, you know.

DUNHAM: Did she have--did they have, did she use childcare during the day? Was
she able to, do you know?

TATE: Well, just like in our family, the oldest one takes care of the youngest.
That&#039;s the way our home was too. When Mom and Dad worked, the older ones had to
take care of the younger ones and it went on like that.

DUNHAM: Okay, so she never, to your knowledge, utilized the--because they just
were starting childcare services because of the women.

TATE: No. The older children took care of the younger ones. That&#039;s the way it was.

DUNHAM: So what, when you got to San Francisco, other memories of what that was
like culturally or socially?

TATE: We were separated in the housing projects. They had a place for blacks to
live and a place for the whites. I remember it was a hill where we were living
and that we were renting, and you had to walk so far up the hill to get to your
place and only too glad to get home and rest before you got out again.

DUNHAM: So how did you feel about that, being marginalized in that way, of
having the separate housing?

TATE: Well, I was used to that at home. In New Orleans we&#039;d live in certain
areas and the whites lived in certain areas.

DUNHAM: When you came out west did you think that you would be escaping that
type of racism?

TATE: I never thought about it.

DUNHAM: Okay, it wasn&#039;t--okay.

TATE: I never thought about it.

DUNHAM: What about--did your parents visit? You said your father came out. Did
your mom come out too?

TATE: When my sister was living in Richmond my dad came out. It was a long time
before he caught a plane because he was afraid to travel, but he did and then
Mom came out. That&#039;s when he came out to help them when they were going to build
a home. That&#039;s when my dad came out.

DUNHAM: What were their impressions of California?

TATE: Well, the boys all mixed up with the groups in school, her children. They
were all mixed in mixed schools there at that time. And I told you, they all
were engineers and things. They formed their own corporation with surveying.

DUNHAM: But your mom and dad, when they visited, what did they think of the West?

TATE: Well, they stayed at the house most of the time and we took them out. They
couldn&#039;t stand the hills in San Francisco, because Mama would say if you can&#039;t
look down the hills, no need to go in town. She was afraid of the hills. But my
dad said that he likes the lowlands. So my other sister lived in San Jose, so
that&#039;s where he wanted to go. He didn&#039;t care too much about San Francisco and
those hills.

DUNHAM: Okay, so the hills--interesting.

TATE: So he went to San Jose, you know, the flatland.

DUNHAM: But they didn&#039;t move out here. They just visited.

TATE: No, they only visited. His last days, after Mom had passed, they brought
him to San Jose to stay. That&#039;s where he died, in San Jose.

DUNHAM: And did you visit New Orleans?

TATE: I visited New Orleans five years after I left, and I was so happy to visit
them and I went--I had--I was making money then. I took them out and we bought
new things for the kitchen and fixed the bathrooms up. I always liked to do
things for my parents, because I knew what a hard time they had with us. So
that&#039;s what I did.

DUNHAM: Well, that&#039;s a great thing that you were able to help them buy their
land and their--built the home.

TATE: Yeah, so he wanted to make an estate, like if the kids didn&#039;t have a place
to stay they can all come back there.

DUNHAM: Did any of them come back?

TATE: Some of them did. They did at one time.

DUNHAM: Is the property still in the family?

TATE: No. My younger sister, when they passed, I turned the property over to
her. She had about eight or nine children. So they stayed there, and then
something happened. The house caught on fire, so when it got burned out we
didn&#039;t bother with it anymore.

DUNHAM: Was there anything else--you were looking at your notes--that I haven&#039;t
asked you about that you wanted to share with me?

TATE: No, just--when I was with my two kids I had opened up a foster home and
took in four more children. And I kept them till high school and then their
mother remarried and she wanted them back. So she would come to the house. I
always asked her when she&#039;d come to don&#039;t have alcohol in her. I would set the
kitchen up. She&#039;s getting there and making cookies with her children and just
having fun. So anyway, she married a guy that was marrying her for the sake of
getting the money, from the children, you know, for himself. I went to visit. He
put me out. He didn&#039;t want me there. I told the social worker what was going on,
so they wanted me to take them back. I couldn&#039;t take them all back because I had
two other little foster girls already. So I took the older girls back and they
stayed with me until high school. One of them got to be a nurse, a registered
nurse. She was a nurse there in Daly City at the hospital there. I still hear
from her and she has grandkids. She sends me pictures of her grandkids and her
children. One of the four girls passed away. There were four that I had. The
other one lives in Santa Clara. So I hear from them quite often. I&#039;m still Mama
Rosborough to them, you know.

DUNHAM: Where did you live in San Francisco after you got married and settled?

TATE: Well, I lived on Frederick Street. Willie Brown didn&#039;t live too far from
us, up in the Haight-Ashbury District. And then we bought a home out in the
Ingleside area when they were selling houses there.

DUNHAM: About when was that, do you know?

TATE: That was when the kids were--Rella was about a year old or something like
that when we moved there.

DUNHAM: Is this in the fifties?

TATE: Rella was born in--yeah, it was in the fifties. And then Webster was born
later, three years later.

DUNHAM: Did you have any trouble as an African American buying a house at that time?

TATE: Well, at that time the whites were selling out. They were moving out.

DUNHAM: From that particular neighborhood.

TATE: From that particular area, and it wasn&#039;t too hard for you to get a place.
Before then you couldn&#039;t, because all whites lived there exclusively.

DUNHAM: Had you tried or had you had to face that?

TATE: Oh you tried, but they--they didn&#039;t want any blacks in the neighborhood,
so the realtor would say, &quot;Well, you know, we keep our places up real nice and
everything. In fact, the neighborhood we moved in, they had a few whites there
and we got to be good neighbors. Then we had some neighbors from Samoa. They got
to be friendly with my son. In fact, one of the kids died. My son was one of the
pallbearers. They were all children together. So everything worked out. We were
living on Victoria Street right off of Randolph. We had different races on our
block, some mixed couples.

One lady had, one white lady had--her house, it wasn&#039;t attached like most of the
houses. She was sorry the day she ever bought it, because when we had the
earthquake she lost--so much of her stuff just fell. But see, our houses were
protecting each other when they&#039;re close together.

DUNHAM: Oh, because they were con[nected]. Okay. Interesting.

TATE: During the earthquake, when my husband was at work, the furniture began
moving from the wall. I grabbed my kids and I got in the car and went to
Richmond. And they say I did the worst thing to go across the bridge, but I
wanted to be around my sister and her family. [laughing] My husband was working
and he said we went off and left him in San Francisco.

DUNHAM: You went on the Bay Bridge? Or you went around the other bridge?

TATE: Bay Bridge. No, the Bay Bridge.

DUNHAM: Oh, I thought it was closed for a while though because it had--

TATE: No, that was later. This was a long time ago when the kids were babies.

DUNHAM: Oh. What year was that earthquake?

TATE: The year was 1957. Yeah, because Rella was four years old and Webster
Junior was a one-year-old baby. I just put them in the car and left, and that
was a big one then. Yeah, because a lot of time--people lost a lot of things
then and they were afraid of fires because of the gas pipes breaking and
everything. So when I left, my furniture was moving from the wall and I said,
&quot;Oh, I&#039;ve got to get out of here.&quot;

DUNHAM: Was that the first time you&#039;d felt an earthquake?

TATE: First time!

DUNHAM: Oh!

TATE: Yeah, that was my first time it happened. And then you could almost tell
when it&#039;s going to come, because your dog started making that long, that howling
sound. That was going on, and then my little glass table had something on it
and, it was just shaking like that. So, that&#039;s the first time I&#039;d ever witnessed
an earthquake.

DUNHAM: And so the earthquake of &#039;89 you were back in North Carolina then? You
weren&#039;t here.

TATE: Oh yeah, I was in North Carolina, because I was calling them. They were
still in the Bay Area and they were grown and had their own places. I called to
see how they were doing.

DUNHAM: And so when your children were growing up did you focus on raising the
kids or did you work or volunteer outside?

TATE: I worked a while when they were growing up and then I opened up the home
for foster kids, so I had a supplemented income. And I was sewing then. I would
make all the clothes. The money from foster care was used food and clothing. And
then later on I started working for a company called Jermarie Lingerie and I
started doing shows in people&#039;s homes. I had one girl that was my model and I
would do a show. I did a show in Brentwood. It was an all-white neighborhood on
the outskirts of San Francisco.

DUNHAM: Oh, out in the East Bay?

TATE: No, there in San Francisco.

DUNHAM: Oh, an area.

TATE: So I have the show in Brentwood. The hostess was a nurse working in a
hospital and she had white nurses working with her and they came to the show.
And one of the nurses decided to book a show from me as well. I went to her home
and it was real classy! They were serving champagne and the husbands were there
and they bought my lingerie. I made a thousand dollars on that show in one night.

DUNHAM: In what year about? [laughter] A thousand dollars?

TATE: Orders, taking orders, yeah.

DUNHAM: Must be good models, too, huh?

TATE: Oh yeah, and I had--and Jermarie had beautiful stuff. So after--

DUNHAM: So the name of the company?

TATE: Jermarie Lingerie. The company was owned by a doctor and his wife.

DUNHAM: How is that spelled?

TATE: J-E-R-M-A-R-I-E [spells] Jermarie.

DUNHAM: So I&#039;ve never heard of this. So you did home modeling of [lingerie].

TATE: Home modeling, and I did that, and when the company found that I could
sell like that, they gave me a trip to Orange County and had a salesman from New
York to come there and give us clues and tips on how to sell.

DUNHAM: More training.

TATE: Training. So, I did that and came up the first runner to the queen. The
queen won a mink coat, but I got a diamond ring and things like that. So I did
real well working for them, and I bought new furniture for my home.

DUNHAM: Okay, now you don&#039;t mind my asking--so is this lingerie--is it pretty
revealing? What year are we talking about?

TATE: You&#039;re talking about--around in the fifties going toward the sixties,
something like that.

DUNHAM: Okay, and so the shows are for women and men?

TATE: Well, the shows actually were for the women, but at this house I went to
they invited their husbands.

DUNHAM: Oh, just that one. Well, it sounded like that worked pretty well.

TATE: Oh, it did! I told you I sold all that. When I sent in my sales to the
Jermarie company, they were so excited that I had sold so much. From that show,
that&#039;s how I got the Penney&#039;s job. I told the Store Manager at JC Penney about
my sales experience with Jermarie, and he said, &quot;You&#039;re hired.&quot; So I started
working for Penney&#039;s after that.

DUNHAM: Wow, and about--so about when was that that you started working for Penney&#039;s?

TATE: Penney&#039;s in the early seventies, I think.

DUNHAM: Okay, and then you worked there for the rest of your career?

Rosboro: I thought it was the late sixties you started.

DUNHAM: Late sixties?

Rosboro: Late sixties.

TATE: Late sixties into the seventies.

Rosboro: The lingerie was modest.

DUNHAM: Okay. Well, I was just curious.

Rosboro: Like Frederick&#039;s of Hollywood.

DUNHAM: Well, I don&#039;t--but maybe for the time it was, I mean, to be--

Rosboro: No, it was very modest.

DUNHAM: Okay.

TATE: We had to learn all about the deniers then, in lingerie, how much denier
was in each garment. The garments weren&#039;t too expensive, but they were good
quality material that we were selling. The owners started their business in a
garage, with one sewing machine. Later on, they had to get a factory, and when
they moved their operation Orange County, they were making in the millions of
dollars. They had supervisors that trained and hired us. I got to be so good
from my training that I did so well in selling. I love selling, and I did real
well with it.

DUNHAM: Yeah, back from the--now, you didn&#039;t call it shave ice, what did you
call it? I call it shave ice, but you called it the--

TATE: Shaving the ice with my snowball stand on the porch.

DUNHAM: Snowball stand, yes, yes. I&#039;m a big fan of shave ice.

TATE: And my praline candies.

DUNHAM: And your--oh right!

TATE: Coconut candy made into pralines.

DUNHAM: So you would sell those too.

TATE: Yes.

DUNHAM: So you&#039;ve always been an entrepreneur.

TATE: I have and didn&#039;t even know it then.

DUNHAM: So how about today? Are you--?

TATE: Today, well--I have been, today I don&#039;t do very much of anything. My
husband has been very sick.

DUNHAM: I&#039;m sorry.

TATE: He&#039;s a retired and 100% disabled veteran from the Air Force.

I did a lot of drama when I was in North Carolina. My sister-in-law had sent me
a play to do that they had done in Washington and I kept it for three years, and
I said I should give it to somebody, but then I said, &quot;I&#039;m going to do it.&quot; So I
talked to my minister and I put on this show. I had fifty people I had to work
with for eight months, because I didn&#039;t want anybody reading. I want you to play
the part. My sister-in-law said, &quot;People are not going to come out on a Saturday
night to something like this.&quot; So I said, &quot;It&#039;s your advertising.&quot; I learned
that from Penney&#039;s. So I had the girls to go to the church and advertise it and
put it on the TV.

And so that night of the show, when we were coming out dressed to go into the
church--we had a house next door that we dressed in--I told them to wait a
minute. People were just flying in there--to let them go in. Then I made the
church a part of my play. When we went in we went in singing, &quot;There&#039;s a Meeting
Tonight,&quot; and shook hands with people. So the audience was included in the play
because the play was really a church convention.

DUNHAM: Okay, so you made it interactive.

TATE: It was very good. My min[ister]--

DUNHAM: What was the play called? Do you remember, or the author?

TATE: The play was called the Slabtown Convention. The author, Nannie H.
Burroughs, a black woman. The Slabtown Convention was a popular church play and
a one-act comedy.

DUNHAM: Okay, well we could check, maybe, if you want, or you can tell me later.
I&#039;m just curious.

TATE: Anyway, we had that play that night and we had--it was packed. They had to
get chairs to put out. My minister told me he didn&#039;t hardly have a place to sit
down. He said, &quot;Where did all these people come from?&quot; So anyway, after the play
I had--like in a convention, I didn&#039;t charge to come in, but we picked up a
collection like they were part of the convention. And at that time we raised
over $300! And I asked him, could I have part of it to thank the people that was
in the play? He said, &quot;Why, sure!&quot; So we had catered food the next weekend. And
I didn&#039;t know this, they had a huge cake made for me to thank me for working
with them so hard to put on a play. So it was nice. And when we left North
Carolina, I have pictures in there. We were on the front page. The mayor came
and bid us farewell, because we had been workers in that town and they knew it.

DUNHAM: Wow. Well, yeah, it seems like you&#039;ve made a mark wherever you&#039;ve gone.

TATE: I did! Really.

DUNHAM: Reflecting back on the war years, can you tell me how you think it has
impacted your life, the opportunity, starting in Bremerton?

TATE: Well, it gave me a chance to be on my own and learn how to do things, with
working in a machine shop. That was my first job. I didn&#039;t have any work before
then. And it was my first job, so it gave me a security thing, like I can work
and make a living for myself. So I felt great about doing those things. And then
for the war, knowing that I was helping out, doing defense work and making
things for the ships, warships and things, I felt good about doing that, you know.

DUNHAM: Yeah, did you have a sense of patriotism at that time?

TATE: Oh yes. Yes, I did, because they needed these things, so here I was a part
of it, working to see that they had it.

DUNHAM: And when the war ended you were able to keep your job as a conductorette?

TATE: Yes, I kept that job for a while.

DUNHAM: But did you leave the job right at the--

TATE: No.

DUNHAM: You were able to keep the--?

TATE: I was able to keep the job.

DUNHAM: Because a lot of the defense industry jobs--

TATE: Right. Then till I make up my mind as to what I wanted to do. So then my
next job was working at the Youth Guidance Center with children.

DUNHAM: And looking back on, again, on your work during the war years doing
so-called men&#039;s work, that considered--how do you think that has influenced
future generations and opportunities for women?

TATE: Well, it gave us a start that we can work just like the men could work.
Because a lot of times they say that the women weren&#039;t getting paid the same as
the men, but we were doing the same work. I didn&#039;t know much about all of this.
It was hearsay, you know. I didn&#039;t know what the men were making. But in the
machine shop, they say that was a job that the men made quite a bit of money
working in a machine shop. And that&#039;s what we were doing. I don&#039;t know how much
they were making after we were, and a lot of times I used to think maybe I
should have kept the job if they were making that kind of money, after the
war--you see what I mean? But no, I didn&#039;t.

DUNHAM: Do you know any women who continued doing machine shop work?

TATE: No, I don&#039;t. No, I don&#039;t.

DUNHAM: Is there anything else you&#039;d like for future generations to know,
particularly about that World War II period?

TATE: Well, it gave us a start, that we can work just like the men could work.
Because a lot of times they say that the women weren&#039;t getting paid the same as
the men but we were doing the same work. I didn&#039;t know much about all of this.
It was hearsay, you know. I didn&#039;t know what the men were making. But in the
machine shop, they say that was a job that the men made quite a bit of money

they were making after we were, and a lot of times I used to think maybe I
should have kept the job if they were making that kind of money, after the
war--you see what I mean? But no, I didn&#039;t.

DUNHAM: Yeah, well it sounds like you had that innately in you or taught you
well. It seems when you weren&#039;t outright leading it seems like you were always
leading by example, if you will.

TATE: Right.

DUNHAM: Well, I want to wrap up. Is there anything else you wanted to share from
your notes today before we close?

TATE: I don&#039;t think so. I think we covered everything. [papers rustling] Yeah, I
think we covered everything. I told you about my job in North Carolina and my
work with kids. I used to pick up kids from their home and go in the park, teach
them how to crochet and things like that. I crochet and knit too, and let them
know that they could do anything if they put their mind to it-- if they were
willing to learn. They made little potholders, and they&#039;d thank me for it and
everything. And one of my little grandnieces had the teacher to invite me to the
class to read to them.

DUNHAM: Right. Well, and you said you&#039;re still active with your church and
beyond, doing readings.

TATE: Yeah, I would do readings for my niece&#039;s 5th grade class. She would sit
there and she was so proud of me because I was her aunt. Her teacher said to me,
&quot;It must be a gift you have, because they&#039;ve never been so quiet before to just
sit and listen to you read to them.&quot;

DUNHAM: What did you read to them?

TATE: Some storybooks she would give me, so I&#039;d read it.

DUNHAM: Well, before we close today is there any poem or anything you might like
to share with us?

TATE: Well, I could do one called &quot;The Master.&quot;

DUNHAM: Okay, if you&#039;d like.

TATE: The title of my poem is &quot;The Master.&quot; [reciting from memory]

They say that the master is coming to visit this town today. But nobody knows
whose house or home that the master might choose to stay. I thought, as my heart
beat wildly, what if he should come to mine? How could I strive to entertain and
honor a guest so divine? Then straightaway I went to toiling, trying to make my
little home more neat. I&#039;d dust, polish, and varnish and deck the blossoms
sweet. Then, right in the midst of my duties a woman came to my door. She had
come to tell me her troubles, and my comfort and help to implore. But I said,
&quot;I&#039;m sorry. I cannot help you today. For I have quite a few things to attend
to,&quot; and the woman went on her way. There was another. And then there was
another, crippled, pale, thin and gray. And she said &quot;Oh, please let me stop and
rest a while in your home, I pray. I have traveled far since morning. I&#039;m
hungry, faint, and weak. My heart is longing for comfort and it&#039;s help I seek.&quot;
But I said, &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I cannot help you today, for I&#039;m looking for a great and
noble guest,&quot; and that woman went on her way. At last the day was ended and my
task was over and done. My house was clean and varnished, so I watched the
setting sun. No one paused at my gate, no one knocked on my cottage door. I
could only pray and wait. I waited until the night had ended and the master to
me had not come. My labor had been for nothing, so I bowed my head and wept. In
spite of all I slept. Then the master appeared before me, with a face so sweet
and fair. &quot;Three times I&#039;ve come to your door to crave your pity and care. Three
times you&#039;ve sent me onward, uncomforted and unblessed.&quot; But I said, &quot;Master,
dear Master. How could I have known it was thee?&quot; And my own soul, shamed and
blamed in the midst of humanity. But he said, &quot;Your sins are forgiven, but the
blessings you might have received was lost unto thee, for failing to comfort the
least of mine, you have failed to comfort me.&quot; That&#039;s it.

DUNHAM: Wow, thank you. I appreciate it.

TATE: You&#039;re welcome.

DUNHAM: And who is that by?

TATE: I don&#039;t know. It was an unknown author.

DUNHAM: Okay. Wow. Well, I think we&#039;ll close with that, and thank you very much.
