WILMOT: Good morning. Today is March 30, 2005. We are here today with Ermestine
Martin. So just to begin, I want to ask you when and where you were born.

MARTIN: I was born May 5, 1926.

WILMOT: And where were you born?

MARTIN: Checotah Oklahoma.

WILMOT: How do you spell that?

MARTIN: Excuse me, Checotah.

WILMOT: Checo--MARTIN: Checotah.

WILMOT: Checotah, Oklahoma. And was that a small town?

MARTIN: Small town, yes.

WILMOT: Can you tell me your parents&#039; names?

MARTIN: My father was Roy Williams and my mother was Tressy Malvrin, later Williams.

WILMOT: Where did they come from? Where are their families from?

MARTIN: They were, Oklahoma, I guess, by way of Africa.

WILMOT: Had they migrated to Oklahoma from another place, do you know?

MARTIN: I don&#039;t think they lived in any other state than Oklahoma. I haven&#039;t
heard them discuss the bordering states like Texas or Kansas. Although my mother
went to school at Topeka, Kansas at Kansas Industrial Education, KIEI. Kansas
Industrial Education Institution. She graduated from there, I think it was in
Topeka, Kansas. I know it was in Kansas. I&#039;m not sure of the city.

WILMOT: Did they ever tell you the story of how they met each other?

MARTIN: No, I didn&#039;t hear that. I heard that my dad proposed to my mom in their
orchard. They had a fruit orchard surrounding their home. I remember the orchard
because I used to work with my grandfather while he was trimming those trees and
things. Later I guess I heard my dad say how he proposed to her father. He asked
for her there in the orchard. I thought that was kind of cute. [laughter]

WILMOT: And what kind of stories did you hear about your mother&#039;s family from
your mother, what did she tell you about them, her family?

MARTIN: She didn&#039;t tell me very much because she didn&#039;t know a lot. She knew her
father, but she didn&#039;t remember her mother. I think her mother was a
schoolteacher and I guess she was pregnant and had the baby and then went back
and caught pneumonia, something like that.

WILMOT: So she died young.

MARTIN: She died when my mother was just an infant. Also, she was my dad&#039;s
teacher at Paradise School, and of course then, I guess he knew her by his
teacher there in school. And then later.WILMOT: Your mother&#039;s mother was your
father&#039;s teacher?

MARTIN: Yes. My father was some years older than my mother.

WILMOT: This was at Paradise School?

MARTIN: Yes. There&#039;s a district there at Checotah, and this is called Checotah
Route 1 area. That was the school, and then the church there, Paradise church
and Paradise School.

WILMOT: Was it like another town?

MARTIN: No, sort of like a district.

WILMOT: Outside of Checotah.

MARTIN: Outside, yes, but the town that accommodated them for the necessities
and so forth was Checotah, it was a base.

WILMOT: A base?

MARTIN: The base for them to go in and do their government affairs.

WILMOT: Like, post office, everything.

MARTIN: Yes, all of that was there. The banks. Either there or another town, but
that was the closest.

WILMOT: Was this one of those famous all-black towns in Oklahoma?

MARTIN: No. It wasn&#039;t. I went to high school in an adjacent district to Route 1,
which was my area, was Rentiesville, and that was an all-black school. I went up
to, graduated from Rentiesville High School. It was Rentiesville School, because
I think it went k-12.

WILMOT: Do you remember who you went to school with?

MARTIN: Oh yes, I remember all my schoolmates.

WILMOT: Who were they?

MARTIN: They weren&#039;t that many, you know, it was small. My classmates or schoolmates?

WILMOT: Your schoolmates, classmates. If you describe them generally, was this
an integrated school was it segregated, was it all black?

MARTIN: It was all black. There were a few families that were very very fair,
you probably couldn&#039;t tell, they were, you know, fair enough to be sometimes
missed as far as what nationality they were. But everyone considered themselves black.

WILMOT: And was there a native American presence at this school, with your
classmates, in the community rather? I should really speak to the community.

MARTIN: Was there Indians in the area? I&#039;m sure, but they weren&#039;t at that school.

WILMOT: Were there other people there like yourself who were part native, part
Indian and were on the rolls?

MARTIN: What--my father, I believe, was possibly more Indian, I mean, a large
percentage. But they were considered Creek Freedmen, they were there when
Oklahoma became a state, and the government sort of--similar to what they&#039;re
doing today, they kind of brought in ownership, home ownership, and then land to
go with that. That&#039;s what--both of my parents were Creek Freedmen.

WILMOT: What does it mean to be a Creek Freedperson?

MARTIN: Well, the Indians and the blacks were both given a settlement in a
sense. They were there at the time and place, and they were given 160 acres of
land. I&#039;m not sure what the Indians were given, but my mother still has her
land. Most of them didn&#039;t keep it. I don&#039;t think they--again, I don&#039;t think it
was done in the sense that to give a person something without enough education
and so forth to handle that--it takes a lot of strength. I don&#039;t know exactly
why but most of them didn&#039;t keep the land, didn&#039;t hold onto it.

WILMOT: Is that piece of land still in your family?

MARTIN: Yes.

WILMOT: Your mom&#039;s land.

MARTIN: My mother&#039;s land.

WILMOT: Can you tell me a little bit more about what you knew about your
father&#039;s family, what he talked about?

MARTIN: I heard him talk about his family, and I knew his mother.

WILMOT: You grew up with your grandmother on your father&#039;s side.

MARTIN: I really didn&#039;t grow up with her, but I would sometimes stop by her home
in Checotah. She lived in town. Because she too had land, and my dad too, but
somehow they weren&#039;t able to hold onto it. For whatever reason they did not have
it. Seemingly, they didn&#039;t even remember exactly where, what part of the area
that was their land. Evidently someone got to them and got some kind of
negotiation and took the land.

WILMOT: Was it, was there, did you know, did that land pass into white peoples&#039;
hands? Or did it stay--

MARTIN: Yes, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s--most of the people that I think took the land or
bought the land, or made a deal, was other than black.

WILMOT: White people. Did you ever hear that song, &quot;Coming to the territory,
coming to the nation?&quot;

MARTIN: I never heard that one.

WILMOT: It&#039;s about Oklahoma. It was actually a Bessie Smith song.

MARTIN: How does it go? I&#039;ve never--

WILMOT: I don&#039;t know the tune, because I&#039;ve only seen the words.

MARTIN: What are the words?

WILMOT: Coming to the territory, coming to the nation. And then it goes on from
there, and I don&#039;t know the rest of it. It&#039;s about Oklahoma and how it was a
place where there was more opportunity for black people to be free.

MARTIN: More opportunity for black people to be free.

WILMOT: In the very early, in the 1800s.

MARTIN: Well, I think--1800s, I don&#039;t know.

WILMOT: Of course not, you weren&#039;t--MARTIN: But I did hear, I know there were,
they had--my dad was born in 1888. They had a school there that the black
children were attending, that was the Paradise School. So I don&#039;t know of the
opportunities that they got by being free. I don&#039;t know whether they were slaves
of Indians, I don&#039;t think they were.

WILMOT: No, when I say free, I don&#039;t mean free versus slave, I mean free, more
opportunities period.

MARTIN: Perhaps so.

WILMOT: And also more of a strong community. That&#039;s the reputation in Oklahoma,
in addition to kind of the very violent things that also happened in Oklahoma in
terms of the Oklahoma race riots. There&#039;s all those, you know, it&#039;s like these
two histories that meet.

MARTIN: Yes, but, I never knew that the Indians--I don&#039;t really know what
happened to the land. As I said, I think quite a few of the people that granted
that land probably never really knew that area that they bought, because someone
with possibly quite a bit of knowledge and understanding took it from them in a
sense, but not really.

WILMOT: Do you mean, kind of craftily, swindled them?

MARTIN: I don&#039;t think it took much to do that, but they were aware that that
person was not quite aware. As I understood a story my dad would tell of a man
that had some land and someone bought him this, offered him this beautiful horse
and a silver saddle, all of the works just for his land. It was kind of strange,
my dad said, the horse got angry because he couldn&#039;t feed him, he gave up all
his land, he didn&#039;t hold on to an acre. He didn&#039;t think about--of course,
someone overpowered him in thought or in conversation. Then looking at that
beautiful horse and the gorgeous saddle and all that. People, we all do that. He
was sold, the idea that he should have this horse and saddle. Many of them were,
I understand, they were sold on the idea. Maybe, I don&#039;t know whether they ever
knew what they were doing.

WILMOT: The value of what they were giving up.

MARTIN: Yes, even if they really knew what they were--you know, like if
government does things, many times, that the average person doesn&#039;t understand
what the government has done, or enough knowledge about real estate and
transactions to actually handle what they were dealt, they were dealt this land.
I guess you have to have knowledge to make things work in your best interest. If
you don&#039;t know--and it happens today now too. People are doing things and don&#039;t
realize what--if you don&#039;t have some education, some intelligence, and really,
you can&#039;t really manage yourself as well as those that really go to school and
know more. My mom did, because, as I said, she went to what was called KIEI, I
remember it better at home, on the wall. It was, as I said before, Kansas
Industrial Education Institute. She probably was one of the few who held on.

WILMOT: That wasn&#039;t your--your mom wasn&#039;t from Kansas, she was from Oklahoma?

MARTIN: She was from Oklahoma.

WILMOT: But she went there for school.

MARTIN: Yes, that would make her still have the land, perhaps.

WILMOT: How would you describe your parents&#039; personalities? Who were they?

MARTIN: Personalities, like?

WILMOT: What was your father like? What was your mother like?

MARTIN: [laughter] My father was a lot of fun. Mama was different, she was just
about like that picture. [shuffles papers] That&#039;s about as much as you&#039;re going
to get out of her.

WILMOT: As a smile?

MARTIN: Yes, she would occasionally--just is just about all you&#039;re going to get
from her. She would, we&#039;d do something real funny and she would get with it and
laugh. She was very sweet and very kind.

WILMOT: Can you tell me what kind of work your parents did? If they were kind of
concerned with this land, working the land?MARTIN: Oh, we worked the land.

WILMOT: What did you grow on the land? And did you grow it to sell, or did you
grow it for your family?

MARTIN: We grew it--we had things that we sold. We sold cotton, I guess corn as
well, and we had cattle, and we sold cream. We didn&#039;t sell the milk, but we
separated it. My dad had a separator, a machine that would take the cream off
the milk immediately. He would sell it at the market.

WILMOT: Did other families then come to you with their milk so that you could
separate it?

MARTIN: No.

WILMOT: Was it a kind of special thing to have in your community?

MARTIN: I didn&#039;t know anyone else when I was growing up that had one of those.

WILMOT: Did people want to use yours?

MARTIN: [laughter] They didn&#039;t have no cows! I didn&#039;t know any, just in that
little Route 1 area, I didn&#039;t know any people in that district that still had
their land.

WILMOT: You were one of the few families that still had your land.

MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

WILMOT: So everyone else was actually share-cropping on other peoples&#039; land.

MARTIN: There were some that had the land, but I don&#039;t remember them
having--they may have had a separator, one of those. We had pretty much all the machinery.

WILMOT: Were there people close enough to visit? Like your playmates and your
friends? Could you go visit?

MARTIN: Yes, but you didn&#039;t do that much because you were busy.

WILMOT: In terms of working your land, was that kind of where--was the whole
family engaged in that, or did you hire people to do it for you?

MARTIN: We occasionally hired. But in the basic setting up the land, setting up
the crops, we did that. Then we had tractors. When I grew up we drove the
tractors. I didn&#039;t remember--I know I had some cousins lived up the way there,
and I don&#039;t remember them doing all that hard work that we did. [laughter] They
didn&#039;t have to do that much work. But we had to. We were just compelled to work.

WILMOT: Did you have family in the area? Aunties and uncles? And just to ask
you, is this light bothering your eyes? Do you want to take a minute?

MARTIN: No, it&#039;s just the conversation bothers me. [tearing]

WILMOT: Because it&#039;s remembering your family. Okay. Do you want to take a break
or do you want to continue? Let&#039;s take a break.

[tape pause]

WILMOT: We&#039;re back on today.

MARTIN: Hi.

WILMOT: Hi. Well, so you were talking about the land and your family. Were you
an only child or did you have siblings?

MARTIN: I had a brother, Leandre, and a sister, Leota Williams. I was the middle child.

WILMOT: You were the middle one.

MARTIN: Yes. The bigger one.WILMOT: Do you remember, did you have a best friend
at that time?

MARTIN: You mean when I lived there?

WILMOT: Mm-hmm.

MARTIN: Well, I had, not necessarily, my cousins lived not far from me, on the
adjoining properties I think. Ellen, was I think about my same age. That was
about the only person that was--you know, that I knew of in that immediate area
that had children or who were black.

WILMOT: Were there white people that lived around?

MARTIN: Oh yes.

WILMOT: You lived in an area with many white people.

MARTIN: Well see, around there, there are acres and acres of land so you&#039;re
spaced out, that&#039;s a natural spacing of people when you&#039;re on acres of land.
It&#039;s not like a lot, and another lot next door.

WILMOT: You couldn&#039;t see your neighbors.

MARTIN: You had to go forty--you go half a mile to get to her home, I suppose.
Those other, by the time I became able to understand things, it seems like my
neighbors immediately pretty much were Caucasian people.

WILMOT: Do you remember about how old you were when you became aware of race as
important, or race as significant?

MARTIN: I didn&#039;t really know much about it. I didn&#039;t even bother about it
because we had Paradise School and the white people went another half a mile to
another school. But we would play together on the way from school. We had a
pond, would freeze with ice and we would skate--with our shoes on, the white and
the black would go that, on our way home and have a little fun for ten or so
minutes, sliding across that ice. Then they would go to their home and we&#039;d go
to ours. It didn&#039;t matter, it didn&#039;t bother us. I didn&#039;t really think about
that, too much, about the segregation. That&#039;s the way it was. My parents, I
think, didn&#039;t really want to get involved into NAACP times, and then you really
try to get in there and do something about it then. But before, I think people
kind of accepted it and didn&#039;t care. I had my family and my friends, and then I
had those friends too, they were my friends. But we just didn&#039;t go to the same
school. That to me, in one sense, is what you do at the school--if it&#039;s an equal
opportunity in that school. I don&#039;t remember their school being any better than
our school. It might have been, I don&#039;t know. I was never in their school. I
know they had the school, and they started a bus for them before we had one I think.

WILMOT: Did your family go to church?

MARTIN: Yes, we went to Rentiesville, the all-black town, the little black town
I was telling you about where I went to high school. We would go to church there.

WILMOT: What denomination was your family, were you raised?

MARTIN: We were Baptists.

WILMOT: You were Baptists.

MARTIN: Yes. They had a Methodist church in that town and a Baptist. They still
have those two churches there in Rentiesville.

WILMOT: And when your family went to go shopping and buy groceries or things for
the house, where would you go?

MARTIN: Checotah.

WILMOT: Checotah, yes. And this town, what did you call it? Rentersville?MARTIN:
Rentiesville. They had one store a black woman owned, the Price family had the
store, the general store.

WILMOT: How did you get to school when you started going to high school?

MARTIN: My dad bought a bus, a school bus. I don&#039;t remember how we got there
before that so much, but I guess we walked. We walked to Rentiesville. The white
kids had a bus, I think before we did. Then my dad--and maybe they spoke out and
they said if we could buy one and manage it, they would work with us. I don&#039;t
know if they made a business deal of it, but I know my dad bought the bus and my
brother drove it, I guess drove the bus to school, to Rentiesville. I guess he
was sixteen or seventeen.

WILMOT: Your brother.

MARTIN: When he drove it, yes.

WILMOT: And this is Le--how do you say it?

MARTIN: Leaudrey. Yes he&#039;d go to--there was another community adjacent down
where kids were, a lot ways from Rentiesville, and Rentiesville was the central
point for the black children. I think the deal was made that if someone could
buy the bus and drive the bus, they could have it, or the city, the county would
work with them. I know when they had, also they had some food programs in, I
guess it, how do you say it, W?

WILMOT: WPA.

MARTIN: WPA, yes. That bus would, my dad or my brother would drive it to this
city, maybe Eufaula, county seat, somewhere to pick up all the things and bring
it to the school building in Rentiesville.

WILMOT: So he was really involved in your education, he was really involved,
like a parent who was really involved in the school.

MARTIN: You mean my brother?

WILMOT: Oh yes, your brother, sorry.

MARTIN: My brother was a student there.

WILMOT: Right, I&#039;m sorry.

MARTIN: He was a year ahead of me. But he would, he was just smart enough to do
it, had the ability. Then my dad--you know, they had the land, so they had the
money to buy the bus. [laughter] But it was a used one, it was one that the
whites had used. Here I go again. [weeping]

WILMOT: That&#039;s okay.

MARTIN: But anyway, he drove it. I would stay at home and drive a car to school.
We had those things, because we had the land. I guess the land, because the
corn--I&#039;ve never seen an ear of corn that looked like--my mother had an area
called &quot;the bottom&quot; and the ears of corn, it seemed like they were more than a
foot long. They were real long.

WILMOT: Really healthy.

MARTIN: Real healthy.

WILMOT: The bottom must have been close to, was it close to a creek?

MARTIN: Yes.

WILMOT: That&#039;s probably what it was.

MARTIN: And then we fished there, it was called &quot;the big hole.&quot; It was like the
creek going through but there was a big hole, there was nice fish in there.
People would like to come from Checotah and fish in the big hole which was on my
mom&#039;s land. Back to that, I guess that&#039;s how she got that institution, because
of the land.

WILMOT: They were able to leverage the land for money to do things.

MARTIN: Yes, and then you worked that land, you had to work it. You just don&#039;t
have land, you have to work it.

WILMOT: I want to ask you about your social life in high school. Were you
popular in high school?

MARTIN: Not really, I&#039;ve never been very popular.

WILMOT: [laughter]

MARTIN: I&#039;m not a popular person. [laughter]

WILMOT: Okay!

MARTIN: I really am.

WILMOT: I asked you a funny question though too. It&#039;s a funny question to say,
&quot;Were you popular?&quot;

MARTIN: I know, but I&#039;ve never been a popular person. I&#039;m not popular now. Vie
would probably tell you that.

WILMOT: I&#039;m sure it depends on who you talk to.

MARTIN: No, I think most people would admit that I&#039;m not popular. I don&#039;t care
to be popular.

WILMOT: Okay.

MARTIN: I just--I don&#039;t want my grandkids to be popular. I&#039;ve got to tell them
now that being popular is--it&#039;s costly sometimes.

WILMOT: You mean, having attention attracted to you?

MARTIN: Not just--you said was I popular in school and that, I said not really,
that wasn&#039;t me.

WILMOT: What was your social life like in high school?

MARTIN: I didn&#039;t have much of a social life because we were out on the land.
Other people were--

WILMOT: It was a rural community, it was a real country community.

MARTIN: Yes, so I didn&#039;t have a social life. I was out there working. The family
was busy. You don&#039;t neglect the farm.

WILMOT: What kind of things were you doing?

MARTIN: I was working with the cows, canning food. Everything.WILMOT: In your
family, what was the attitude around education? Did all three of you, the
siblings, go to college, or was it just you?

MARTIN: Let&#039;s see, my sister and I did, but my brother was drafted in the
service after high school. He was valedictorian of his class, very smart. That&#039;s
why I said he was smart enough to drive the bus. Whatever he wanted to do, he
could do it. He was a straight A student. When he came back, when I left
Langston University, and because of the draft he came to California, he came
here and he started work and he didn&#039;t go back. He didn&#039;t go to college.

WILMOT: So he was drafted into World War II.

MARTIN: Correct.

WILMOT: And you were at college at Langston. Langston is in what state? I&#039;m sorry.

MARTIN: Langston is in Oklahoma. It&#039;s not far from Oklahoma City, it&#039;s close to
Guthrie and was quite a distance from Checotah.

WILMOT: Were you excited about going? Were you scared to leave your family?

MARTIN: No!

WILMOT: No you weren&#039;t excited, or you weren&#039;t scared?

MARTIN: I wasn&#039;t either way. I wasn&#039;t excited and I wasn&#039;t scared. I was going
to college, that was it. I wasn&#039;t that excited, it was just something I was
going to do. I wasn&#039;t like, exactly told that, &quot;You&#039;re going,&quot; I surprised--I
think I told them I was going, I told my parents I was going. I worked at the,
like, you know, Eufaula Oklahoma had a military ammunition depot and I worked
there. My mother worked there too. I saved my money, and just told my mom I was going.

WILMOT: Did everyone from your high school go to college?

MARTIN: You mean that graduated with me? I really don&#039;t know.

WILMOT: How many people was it, about, in your high school?

MARTIN: It was about eight of us only.

WILMOT: In the graduating class?

MARTIN: Mm-hmm. The class was small.

WILMOT: So you knew each other.

MARTIN: We knew each other but I didn&#039;t really know them that well because when
my brother would take the bus he would go down to Pine Hollow, it was another
district, and bring up all the black kids out of there and take them all, bring
them all to Rentiesville, that black town. I would be--somehow I would stay in
the house and not take that long ride, and do some things before going to
school. I was allowed to drive the car to school.

WILMOT: Was there, did people kind of come to know you as the family that drove
the, that had the bus? Was that special status?

MARTIN: Well, you see, I don&#039;t know, because I wasn&#039;t their friends and they
weren&#039;t exactly my friends because they lived in a distant--I really have no
idea. You brought a question that I never thought of, what they thought of me. I
know I was the only kid drove a car to school and parked it with the teachers.
The teachers had cars, and our car was maybe newer than some, some teachers
didn&#039;t have one. But the land did that.

WILMOT: What about like dating in high school and social life of that nature,
when you came to be a young person and their were boys?

MARTIN: Some boys liked me I guess, and some, I don&#039;t know whether they liked me
or not. [laughter]

WILMOT: Did you go to movies or go out on dates?

MARTIN: Not really, we didn&#039;t do a lot of that. We&#039;d go to church, and then
probably come back home. We weren&#039;t into that kind of society where we did a lot
of things like that. I think you go then, and in my case, it was to get out of
there and go to college, and not so much--there were some people that I knew
there at school. But I think maybe in those days you didn&#039;t think about as much
dating. I don&#039;t think you did as they do today.

WILMOT: Maybe you would just think about marriage.

MARTIN: I think you think more about marriage and trying to get yourself
established and things like that, not how many times you can date somebody or
what you&#039;re dating. Especially, maybe the children that lived in Rentiesville
might have done a lot of socializing, or in Checotah, but I didn&#039;t.

WILMOT: You were really out in the--

MARTIN: Yes. And then my best friend, in a sense, was white people, were my
friends, because they were my neighbors, and we did things together. At the
butcher, my daddy would butcher the hogs, by what meat, and they would join
together. When you&#039;re--just like I was, across the way from me on a piece of
land I think was owned by maybe some of my family. There was some white people,
and I knew the girls well, and they were kind of my friends, but only to say
&quot;hi&quot; and recognize each other. But I don&#039;t think I ever remember being in their home.

WILMOT: Or them coming to your home?

MARTIN: No, but we&#039;d skate on the pond. Because I think the parents didn&#039;t know
we were skating, we just had a good time. Just for a second, because we were all
wise enough not to stay there long enough to let the parents worry about us
coming home. We just skate across there and come home. I don&#039;t--the other people
were Jacksons and they had one little boy, little Caucasian kid, and he was
walked from his house up to our house--didn&#039;t know where he would be, sometimes
he&#039;d come up.

WILMOT: He&#039;d just wander away from his house to yours.

MARTIN: But they didn&#039;t mind. It was just--the roads had not a lot of traffic or
anything, there was no bad people loose in the area. His name was John Henry,
they were Jacksons. He would come, stay with us a while, maybe we&#039;d take him
home. He was younger than I was, a lot younger. I&#039;d walk him part of the way
home. Then my cousin lived up about a half a mile. I think they went--I didn&#039;t
socialize much with her either. These people were right close to me. I kind of
think that when a person or families are neighbors and get along okay, that you
don&#039;t feel segregation so much. Especially when you&#039;re on the farm and you raise
everything, you don&#039;t have to do the kind of thing you have to do when you--say
for example that I was in the city, in a mass of black people, I think as you
get many numbers together then that&#039;s probably where more problems start.

WILMOT: And you have to buy more things and you&#039;re more in contact with white people.

MARTIN: I think that if you are in the situation that I was in, there were only
a few people in the whole area out there, and my immediate neighbors were not black.

WILMOT: I understand.

MARTIN: So that got to be just my friends, you know, get along with them and
they got along with me.

WILMOT: How many years were you between high school and college? Because you
said you were working in the ammunitions factory with your mother.

MARTIN: No, I worked, after getting out of high school I worked to go to
college, for that semester, for the first semester.

WILMOT: Then you were right into college.

MARTIN: I went right, yes, I just stayed there for two months, or two and a half months.

WILMOT: What was college like for you?

MARTIN: It was okay.

WILMOT: What did you major in?

MARTIN: Domestic science.

WILMOT: How many years were you there?

MARTIN: I was there one year.

WILMOT: And did you, was the social life--was this a coed school? Were there
boys also there?

MARTIN: Oh yes.

WILMOT: So it was coed, there was a lot--what was the social life like there?

MARTIN: What was it like? It was, from my side, I didn&#039;t actually have a social
life there, as far as, you mean, boys?

WILMOT: Or in general, just friends.

MARTIN: I had some friends, yes.

WILMOT: Movies, dances.

MARTIN: Not too much of all of that either. I think that, I think in today&#039;s
world they have more of that than they did in those days, do you? You seem to be
well informed.

WILMOT: [laughter]

MARTIN: Do you think they had so much social life as they do today?

WILMOT: It depends on who you talk to. I find that people say sometimes they did
a lot of dancing, and I don&#039;t mean dating, I mean dancing. People say, &quot;Oh we
were out, we went dancing all the time, we had people over to our house all the
time.&quot; It depends on who you talk to. Or, &quot;We went to the movies, we went to
different things.&quot; It&#039;s whichever, however.

MARTIN: I think where I lived, if I had lived in Rentiesville or Checotah I
would have a lot more of that to talk about, but where I lived, we had to get
there and be there. You weren&#039;t allowed to be--maybe spend the night no where
{??} things like that. We had a family and that was a pretty close-knit family.

WILMOT: So you lived at home while you were at school, at college.

MARTIN: No, I lived on the campus.

WILMOT: Oh you did?

MARTIN: Yes. They had quite a nice campus. They had an agricultural department,
and I think they raised a lot of the food, they had very nice food. I remember
being 130 pounds and went to right quickly to about 160. I think because out on
the farm I was always quite busy, and there I didn&#039;t do anything but go to the
dining hall for my food. It seemed like the food was very good. I have an
inclination to gain weight rapidly anyway. And no exertion. When you&#039;re on the
farm you&#039;re moving, you have to move. Even working at McAllister. I said
Eufaula, but it was McAllister was were the ammunition depot was.

WILMOT: McAllister. That would have been, 1926, that would have been in the
middle, actually you had just--did the Depression--

MARTIN: It was in the forties.

WILMOT: Did the Depression affect your family at all?

MARTIN: The Depression.

WILMOT: In the 1930s. I know you were very young then, you were only four at the time.

MARTIN: I don&#039;t know, they built a house, they put together an orchard probably
in the thirties.

WILMOT: Now you said--can you tell me a little bit about coming out to--oh no,
here&#039;s one question. When you left Langston University--

MARTIN: I left because my parents were leaving. Dad sold the farm equipment, and
they came through Langston.

WILMOT: To get you.

MARTIN: No, they didn&#039;t come for me, they came to say goodbye. They were
stopping in Oklahoma City to have the car tuned up or something like that. They
drove away and I kept thinking, &quot;I ought to go with them.&quot; I wanted to go with them.

WILMOT: Did they want you to come, or they wanted you to finish school?

MARTIN: They didn&#039;t know I felt that way, I didn&#039;t say that. I just thought,
after they drove away and I thought about them. Then I went, I tipped out of the
dormitory and ran downtown, that&#039;s kind of on a country road, small highway--the
university is kind of off the highway, the busses are down there on the highway.
I tipped down, got down and got a bus to Oklahoma City. I knew the woman&#039;s
name--I don&#039;t know how I was thinking other than I was overpowered by the fact
that I wanted to go and I didn&#039;t know how to call them. So I went out there and
at the bus station, I was so lucky, the bus, the men, the porters in the bus
station, I asked him if he knew Mary Cooksie, who had a rooming house, I knew
she had a rooming house, and he said he thought he did know them, and when he
got off he would take me there. I was also very brave, because I didn&#039;t know the
man. But I had something I wanted to do, I wasn&#039;t scared of nothing, because my
goal was to go there and come to California with them. He did know, he drove me
up to that place, and he went to the door with me and that was the right place,
and it shocked them. [laughter] They were shocked to see me coming up there. I
spent the night and then we came back to Langston and I checked out, that&#039;s how
I left, coming to California.

WILMOT: They were going to California because the drought had caused all the
crops to fail?

MARTIN: Yes, they had had so many years of crop failure. See, my mother never
worked, but she started working at Eufaula, I mean, McAllister. I think that&#039;s
probably why she started to work. Then he couldn&#039;t make a successful crop at
all. I don&#039;t know how that heat and no water, it was really awful.

WILMOT: So when you--did you drive out to California with your family, or did
you take the bus or did you take the train?

MARTIN: No, we drove that car that I was driving to high school. It was a 1940 Chevy.

WILMOT: You drove it all the way--did you go to L.A. first, or did you come
straight through?

MARTIN: No we came straight through, because my dad had some friends who lived
in Richmond, this town, they had made some contact with him. We came her and
found a place to live in North Richmond. We found a little place, one room or
something with a small kitchen.

WILMOT: Where was it?

MARTIN: It was in North Richmond on Sixth Street, I believe. I used to remember
the woman&#039;s name that had this little accommodation for us. We stayed there
until we had some other people that Dad knew that built a hotel on Gertrude and
he had a little three-room house that we rented until we went to Canal? They had
Canal Projects. We went to live there.

WILMOT: You were how old when you came here?

MARTIN: I was probably nineteen.

WILMOT: You were nineteen, and so that would have been 1945 that you came here,
right at the end of the war.

MARTIN: Yes, it was at the end of the war. That&#039;s why I said I didn&#039;t really
work in the shipyards.

WILMOT: Yes. What kind of work did you do when you got here?

MARTIN: I didn&#039;t do anything for a while. My first job was at NBC company in San Francisco.

WILMOT: Was that a paper company?

MARTIN: No, it was National Biscuit Company, and I was successful in being
talked about because I became supervisor.

WILMOT: You were so young.

MARTIN: Yes, but I worked hard.

WILMOT: Did you take the Key train over there?

MARTIN: No, I took the bus. We were here, but down about, you know, the Canal
was not far from here, the Canal apartments. The shipyard was just around the
corner from Canal Projects, where we lived. The route to the shipyard number 3,
there was a bus service going there, so I used the bus to go to San Francisco.

WILMOT: So you were, what was Richmond like then? I want to ask you more
specifically, because that was a broad question, who were your neighbors? What
was the community like?

MARTIN: I didn&#039;t know too much about it. [laughter] I mean, when I came to North
Richmond I didn&#039;t know anybody, and I don&#039;t remember meeting any girls in North
Richmond. Although I went to a church, I went to {McLaughlin?} Temple and I
would look at them and enjoy their music, when I first came. I don&#039;t remember
meeting any girls or boys in North Richmond when I came here, when I stayed out
there. It was sort of like I lived at home. I didn&#039;t bother too much. That
wasn&#039;t my goal. My goal was to get me a job and get back in school, something
like that. So that keeps your mind so going, you&#039;re not totally interested in--

WILMOT: As far as neighbors, even beyond social life, did you live in a black
community, or was it integrated?

MARTIN: Where, in North Richmond?

WILMOT: Here in North Richmond.

MARTIN: North Richmond was primarily all-black, I think.

WILMOT: I don&#039;t know.

MARTIN: There were a few others.

WILMOT: Were people from Oklahoma, or were people from other states?

MARTIN: The people that my dad knew here was from Oklahoma. One was from Tulsa
and I don&#039;t know where the other one was from.

WILMOT: Did you know any other people who were also from like, Louisiana or
Texas, Arkansas, other places?

MARTIN: You mean, in North Richmond when I was there?

WILMOT: Mm-hmm.

MARTIN: I don&#039;t remember meeting any people.

WILMOT: Okay. [laughs]

MARTIN: Because it wasn&#039;t that long. It&#039;s kind of like, you&#039;re there for maybe
six months or so.

WILMOT: Oh, okay. And then you went to the Canal?

MARTIN: And then I went from that 6th Street to Gertrude, and we weren&#039;t there
long and then we were in Canal, and then I met people.

WILMOT: So who lived around you in Canal?

MARTIN: Willie McGee&#039;s mom and father was our next door neighbor. Do you know
Willie McGee? He&#039;s a famous ball player from here, from Richmond. All the church
people I knew. I met people there. I started work in San Francisco, and I met
people from the Canal area. Because I was there a long time, and I wasn&#039;t in the
other, North Richmond, I wasn&#039;t there very long. But I remember personalities
because I would go to that church and watch them sing. I don&#039;t know if you know
Ernestine Cleveland Reeves?

WILMOT: Hmm-mm.

MARTIN: She has quite a religious work in Oakland, a woman, she&#039;s now a bishop.
That was there their membership was and I used to hear them sing and I&#039;d go back home.

WILMOT: You were also making money for the first time. No, you worked before at
the ammunition center, but what did you do with your money? Were you saving it,
were you spending it? Were you buying yourself clothes, were you buying yourself
stockings? I know it was during the war.

MARTIN: [laughter] What I did with it, I remember, the first money I made, I
bought a suit for my mom, one for myself, and a dress, black and white, for my
sister, and something for my dad, and we went to--we dressed up in those clothes
to go to the beach. I had gone to the beach, and I wanted them to go, and we
dressed up to go. We were on the bus going to the beach. Did you ever go there?

WILMOT: Which beach?

MARTIN: In San Francisco.

WILMOT: Ocean Beach?

MARTIN: The one where all the--

WILMOT: Cliff House?

MARTIN: That area, yes.

WILMOT: Ocean Beach, all the way past the avenues.

MARTIN: That&#039;s right. I think we went all the way on the bus. I don&#039;t know why I
thought you had to dress up to go, but I bought these things with my money so we
could dress up and go to the beach. I saved my money, because I didn&#039;t have to
pay to live at home. My father was doing--he got some work right away, and he
was a good worker, so he was successful. I think he worked some at the shipyard.
Then there was something going on in the Canal area, and he rented a little
place and opened up a business called the Paper Shack, no, it wasn&#039;t the Paper
Shack, Kiss Shack I think. It had Kiss soda pop, Kiss, a K. I think that&#039;s what
he named it, Kiss Shack. He had a lot of, ice cream, and my mother thought he
shouldn&#039;t quit the work to do that, she thought the work was somewhat more
secure, but he quit anyway. Then I used to get, when I was going back to school,
I would come home from school and work there with him and my mom. It was a real
thriving little business. My dad had this kind of personality that would draw
people as well. He was more sociable than me and my mom I guess. My brother was
real sociable too. My sister too. I probably got that kind of--my mom was
sociable but not to the extent that my dad was. But my mom was so religious, she
was always in church. She was there. Because she became chairperson of the
Deborah circle and had, I think, at one time, the largest group of women in her circle.

WILMOT: Chairperson of the what circle?

MARTIN: Deborah, biblical, Bible.

WILMOT: Thank you.

MARTIN: She really was highly respected by her--

WILMOT: Was this still a Baptist church?

MARTIN: That was Baptist, still the church I am in today, and she died as a
member there.

WILMOT: She passed in 1991?

MARTIN: 1984.

WILMOT: 1984. Okay.

MARTIN: My dad died in &#039;81, and she died in &#039;84.

WILMOT: She followed him. I wanted to ask you more about when you said there was
something going on in Canal and so your father got this little shop. Did your
whole family move out of Canal at that time, or did you stay?

MARTIN: No, we were living in Canal. But just in the same Canal area he started
the business.

WILMOT: Oh I see, when you said there was something going on you meant something
positive, there was enough traffic for people to really--

MARTIN: Oh, there&#039;s a lot of people living in Canal.

WILMOT: What were your--

MARTIN: There&#039;s like so many, in little building, had maybe eight families, and
then another one kind of made an L shape and there was another eight families.

WILMOT: How many units? So there were eight units in each of these buildings?

MARTIN: I think probably eight.

WILMOT: Or maybe were families sharing?

MARTIN: Oh no, they had their own. The ones where we were living, our unit had
two bedrooms.

WILMOT: Were they--

MARTIN: There wasn&#039;t two bedrooms, there was a bedroom and living room and we
used the living room as a bedroom.

WILMOT: So there was two bedrooms.

MARTIN: There was two rooms. It was a kitchen, bathroom, and two other rooms.

WILMOT: Ah, so you used them, okay.

MARTIN: And most families seemed to have used the living room as, you know, a
combination of sleeping and a living room.

WILMOT: You may have told me, the other families, where were they from? Were
they Bay Area folk?

MARTIN: Next door was a group, was a group of people from Chicago, and other
people were from throughout the United States. Mostly from the south lands. The
girl next door, that family, I don&#039;t know the parents were, but the girls were
from Chicago. I think they came here. Maybe they weren&#039;t from Chicago.

WILMOT: Are you in touch with any of the people that you lived with when you
were that young?

MARTIN: Did I what?

WILMOT: Are you in touch with any of those people still?

MARTIN: That I knew there? Not really. Yes, in a sense. You know, like, the
people in our church, a lot of them lived right around our unit, which was 89M I
think. Building 89M or something like that. They were always at the same church
that my mother--I think my mother and some of the ladies worked at a fish place,
cannery, somewhere down on here they had a fish cannery and several of the
people that went to church with my mom, they all worked there.

WILMOT: Do you remember where the people who went to church with your mother
were from?

MARTIN: I really don&#039;t know.

WILMOT: Any of the ladies?

MARTIN: Mrs. Haines was one of them and I think she--I don&#039;t know where they
were from. As a matter of fact, I didn&#039;t know--I wasn&#039;t really that close. We
were right there but I worked in San Francisco and just sleeping and then I&#039;d go
to San Francisco to work, and I imagine I wasn&#039;t in nobody&#039;s house, because I
was reared kind of like that.

WILMOT: You were busy.

MARTIN: Yes, I was reared to not be in peoples&#039; houses all the time.

WILMOT: Did you have a sense that--why were people, why do you think that was?

MARTIN: Why?

WILMOT: What you just said. Reared to not be in peoples&#039; house all the
time.MARTIN: [laughter] Why? I guess they knew. My mom had a lot of wisdom, I
guess that&#039;s wisdom, maybe not. It might be not good, but that&#039;s the way, you
weren&#039;t to be in peoples&#039; homes.

WILMOT: You were to just be close to home.

MARTIN: You were supposed to be doing something, and you can&#039;t do much in
someone else&#039;s home. You&#039;ve got to get out, either go to school or go to work,
or do something for yourself, sewing or cooking or canning, or do something. You
don&#039;t be in someone&#039;s home.

WILMOT: Just visiting.

MARTIN: Yes. We don&#039;t know why. [laughter] We don&#039;t quite know why you do that,
other than holidays and things.

WILMOT: Well, I wanted to ask you also, did you have a sense of why people came
here? When you talked to--why did the people who lived in Canal Project, why
were people here? Why did they come here?

MARTIN: They came here to find--to better their conditions. They heard about the
need for people to work in the shipyards. I would say 95 percent of them came
for that reason. To get a job--I understand they said there were a lot of people
from Oklahoma, Arkansas, I guess, all those places. They mostly probably all had
sort of that--I know Oklahoma had this serious, very serious drought. There was
a way to survive. I thought my dad made probably a good move, because if he
couldn&#039;t do the farming, and then you know, he could work, and he came where
there was work in California. Although it was just closing down when we came.
But he right away got a job in the shipyards, I believe. No, he joined the
union. I think they did some cleanup work out there. This other part, they were
cleaning up, was where he found this, saw this piece of land, this little place
and whoever controlled it, he asked them if he could rent it. He was
self-motivated and he rented that. My mother thought he should stay in the
construction business. Then she worked there too, we all worked.

In the afternoon, we had a lot of ice cream, I don&#039;t know why ice cream seemed
to have been so special.

WILMOT: The sweet shop.

MARTIN: Yes. Then I remember dipping till this finger was kind of setting, kind
of getting a little bit deformed. Because you know, like, when families kind of
come back, everybody&#039;s home and it will be real crowded. Then he started selling
vegetables in there, too.

WILMOT: Let&#039;s take a break.
