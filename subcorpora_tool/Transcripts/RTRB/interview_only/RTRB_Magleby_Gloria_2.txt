ARBONA: Today is Thursday, July 29, 2010, and this is actually our second
interview with Gloria Magleby. I&#039;m Javier Arbona, and this is our third tape
overall, number three, and we&#039;re back again at the house in Bay Point, California.

MAGLEBY: You bet.

ARBONA: We were just talking about a good starting point that could be going
back to a little bit where we finished last time and pick up where we left off.
You told us about some German POWs that were, I guess, captured during the war,
and you mentioned in that interview that they were baptized through your church.

MAGLEBY: Yes, I did.

ARBONA: And I just thought I&#039;d ask you first if you could expand on that a
little bit, how you knew them or knew of their stories and what else came of them.

MAGLEBY: I will. You know there were five of them in all, and what was
interesting is that we found a man from Martinez who could speak fluent German.
So we got him, the church did, and brought him over to Camp Stoneman and said,
&quot;Let&#039;s send out a notice to the German prisoners of war that if they wanted to
come and listen to your discussions on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints that they could.&quot; I do not know how many came to listen, but five of them
decided that they liked the message, and they received extensive knowledge about
the church and lots of classes, and decided to join the church. Well, that
meant, of course, that the church had to talk with the powers that be in the
Army and say, &quot;Can we take these five German prisoners of war down to the Suisun
Bay or the waterfront and baptize them?&quot;

ARBONA: [noise] We have a truck going by.

MAGLEBY: That&#039;s a big truck. But we will pay no attention to trucks. Anyway,
they agreed that that would be fine, but they had to send guards, and that we
could take priesthood, which would be at least three men, one to baptize and two
to witness the baptism, and that it would be all right to take them down to the
waterfront and baptize them. Now, I remember the names of two of them, Alfred
{Amelong?} and Karl {Hillen?}, and I wrote to them after the war was over
because in talking with them I remember saying to them one time, &quot;Wouldn&#039;t you
like to live in America?&quot; And they looked at me like, &quot;No. We&#039;re Germans. We
want to go home.&quot; And I thought to myself, &quot;Well, that was a dumb question to
ask them.&quot; It would be like asking me, &quot;Do you want to leave with us and go to
Germany and live?&quot; So I appreciated their comments that they appreciated the
care that they were given by the American soldiers and by the Army, but that
when the war was over, they wanted to go home. They had wives and families there.

And so understanding that they were going to be in Germany, we found out where
they went, and I and some of the others wrote letters to them just saying,
&quot;Thank you for letting us appreciate your testimony of the Gospel, and we want
you to know that when you joined the church you joined a huge church, and that
there were lots of members in Germany, and that you are welcome in the wards
there.&quot; We heard back from them for a while, and I&#039;m so sorry that I didn&#039;t
actually stay in touch with them because now that I&#039;m this old, I could have had
a lot more experience with how they were accepted when they got home. &quot;You mean
you joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints while you were in
America? What was the big idea of that?&quot; And I didn&#039;t hear any of that. Or maybe
they said, &quot;Good for you. It&#039;s time you got some Christian gospel in you.&quot; So I
just don&#039;t know what happened to them.

ARBONA: I take it you saw them at services several times.

MAGLEBY: Yes, I did. Very nice men, very clean cut, but they had families and
children, and they wanted to go home. But when they got home, we wanted them to
know that we were appreciative of their testimonies of the Gospel and that we
appreciated them joining the church. So we wanted to kind of keep up with them.
Matter of fact, I think we sent them some gifts. We, meaning the bishop and some
of the other priesthood members, like maybe some fudge or candy or things like
that, maybe cookies. But we wanted to stay in touch with them and tell them that
we will always remember them. And I still do to this day.

ARBONA: And aside from the person from Martinez that could speak German, would
other people at church speak with them or try to communicate with them?

MAGLEBY: No. They didn&#039;t come to church per se. They only had classes at Camp
Stoneman. They did not participate in our meetings. They only had classes at
Camp Stoneman, weren&#039;t allowed to leave the Camp, of course.

ARBONA: So the bishop would have to go to the camp.

MAGLEBY: The bishop would have to go to the camp, and other priesthood members
and the teacher from Martinez would go to the Camp Stoneman area. And I think
they were taught, I&#039;m sure, thinking back on it, in an old chapel there. And by
the way, that old chapel went up for sale after World War II was over, and the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints bid on the chapel, and we won. Out
of fifteen bidders, we won the chapel, and I think I explained this last time--

ARBONA: Yeah.

MAGLEBY: That we paid $984, something like that, for the whole church.

ARBONA: Wow. So did you ever go to Camp Stoneman to that service then?

MAGLEBY: Absolutely. Absolutely. As a matter of fact, I went to Camp Stoneman to
meet with members of the church that would be my age. See, I was only eighteen
years of age then, and we had services for members of the church, servicemen
there, so I was there a lot. I led the singing for them. They pretty much ran
the service because they know how, but the young men were not connected at all
with these German prisoners; that was another story completely. But we did have
services at Camp Stoneman before the war was over and then, of course, after the
war was over. That was interesting, too.

ARBONA: And how much longer did they stay around after the war? Were they sent
back immediately after?

MAGLEBY: No. Most of the American servicemen went home. I don&#039;t recall that very
many stayed; maybe some married a girl from Pittsburg. I think three or four
that I know of did, but most of them after the war was over went back to their homes.

ARBONA: Sorry, I just meant the Germans.

MAGLEBY: Oh, no. They didn&#039;t stay around at all. When the war was over they went
back to Germany fast.

ARBONA: Right away.

MAGLEBY: And I don&#039;t know how they went back, whether they went by boat or
whether they flew them back or how, but they went back to Germany. That&#039;s why we
wrote to them in Germany.

ARBONA: Did you keep any of those letters?

MAGLEBY: No. I didn&#039;t. Well, I don&#039;t think I did. In the house that I live in
now, it&#039;s a trash bin for lots of lots of things because I save everything. And
so there&#039;s a possibility that I could find one of those letters eventually, but
at this point in time I don&#039;t think I kept any.

ARBONA: Well, just shifting subjects a little bit, another one of our--through
our conversations we talked about, talking about the community of Port Chicago--

MAGLEBY: Right.

ARBONA: I guess we can start by talking about your friends there, or how you
socialized with people at Port Chicago, how were you familiar with Port Chicago
since you&#039;re here. You&#039;re close by; you&#039;re here in Bay Point which is only a few miles.

MAGLEBY: Yes. Exactly.

ARBONA: So how did you come to know people in Port Chicago?

MAGLEBY: Well, mostly from school, and I did not go to Port Chicago that much
while I was going to school because there was nothing for me to go there for. I
didn&#039;t live there. But I had friends there, and it was just another part of the
community like this Bay Point or West Pittsburg was a part of Mt. Diablo High
School, such as Pleasant Hill was part of it. So there were lots of little
communities that went to Mt. Diablo High School, including Port Chicago. So my
friends that lived in Port Chicago were the same as friends who lived in Clyde
or Nichols or Pleasant Hill or, of course, Concord.

But the reason I got close to Port Chicago is that before I graduated there was
a man that came from the Naval Magazine and interviewed girls and boys who
needed a job or who wanted a job because there were many being offered. And I
went to an interview, and I signed up right then and there. So the very first
job I ever got out of high school was at the Naval Magazine in Port Chicago. And
this would be late June 1944, and remember, it&#039;s July 17 that it blew up. So I
was only there for almost less than a month working as a clerk typist. Then came
the explosion, but that was a boon for me because I wanted to go to school. And
I had to have some money to go to school or to go to college, and so I took the
opportunity to take a job there, and I worked there from July through the
explosion through December and then went to the University of Nevada in Reno to
school with the money I made.

ARBONA: I recall from our last conversation that you, as you just mentioned, you
left and then you came back, so what were your impressions when you returned
about how Port Chicago was recovering after the explosion. What did it look like?

MAGLEBY: Well, I was intimately concerned about it because I had a very good
friend and family, the Chomor family. He has passed away and she is long gone,
but they lived in Port Chicago, were members of our church and were just full of
agony when they realized that the Navy at that time wanted to destroy Port
Chicago and use that area as a buffer zone for the Naval Magazine. And they
worked day and night, some of the people in Port Chicago, to save their town.

Now you can imagine what it would be like having been born and raised in a
little community on the waterfront and all of a sudden, you&#039;re going to have to
leave your house, watch it razed to the ground, demolished, and you wanted to
save it. You didn&#039;t want anything like that ever to happen to your little
hometown. And so it was an agony that they went through and that their friends
went through. They went everywhere that they knew how. They went to Washington.
They went to Sacramento. They wrote letters by the thousand and petitioned by
the thousand, but nothing would deter the Navy from saying, &quot;You have to leave
Port Chicago. We&#039;re going to use this as a buffer zone, and it&#039;s going to be demolished.&quot;

Now, I&#039;m sure they didn&#039;t say that directly to them, but that&#039;s what happened.
And it was agony for me to watch, to see the people. In a way, they died the day
they all had to leave Port Chicago. And they still remember it as the place they
were born and raised and the sweet, sweet memories they have of that little
town. And, as I said before, it was a bitter agony to my mind than some of the
men that died in the war because they knew they were there to fight for us, and
the families knew that if they were killed, then that was part of war; that&#039;s
what war does. But this group of people were wiped off the face of the earth
without dying. And that&#039;s what was so hard for me and for everyone to accept,
that they were gone from their little town. They tried and tried and failed, and
that was what was so agonizing for all of us. And that was a bigger story by far
than the mutiny. The mutiny was a few men who died, of course, but men were
dying all over the world in the war. They knew they were going to die, many of
them. The mutiny itself was not near the story that a whole community of
mothers, fathers, children, grandmothers, grandfathers, wiped out. The town is
not there any more, but they still call it home. That&#039;s the name of the little
book that was written about them.

ARBONA: You mentioned the name Chomor.

MAGLEBY: Yes.

ARBONA: C H O M O R?

MAGLEBY: C H O M O R. Arthur Chomor. He was very instrumental in doing his best
to keep Port Chicago alive, and it died. They weren&#039;t successful, but they
gained friendships during that time that will be everlasting. And the whole
community of Port Chicago stayed together as much as they possibly could and
still coming Saturday, have another reunion of what is left. It gets smaller and
smaller because people do die, but they do have a reunion, and the children of
those who lived there are going to probably keep that reunion going as long as
they possibly can, once a year, the last Saturday in July, Port Chicago reunion
at the Ambrose Park in Bay Point.

ARBONA: Have you gone some years?

MAGLEBY: I have indeed, and it&#039;s very, very fun to watch them. They&#039;re older and
older, you see lots of canes, and you see lots of walkers and so on. But there
are a younger generation, too, that joins them, and they will carry on I feel
confident. But it&#039;s fun to watch them talk about the good old days in Port
Chicago, and I am so sorry that their town is gone, but their friendships will
never die.

ARBONA: Do you remember when you first heard that the Navy was trying to condemn
the town, approximately what year that was?

MAGLEBY: Oh, boy. I do not remember because I was going to school and getting
employment by myself. You&#039;d have to talk more to the people who lived there and
who were intimately involved. I certainly do remember the time, but not
intimately. The Arthur Chomor type would remember that, but there are many
people that will be at the reunion on Saturday who will remember, and that would
be a good place for you to find out and talk directly with those who said, &quot;I
remember the day I left my house.&quot; And they will tell you the agony they went
through. The whole world, it seemed like, turned on them. They felt like they
had been rejected by the country and by the world. They were in a state of angst
because of what has happened. But they left, and they survived.

ARBONA: Did you ever become active during that period, going to any meetings or--?

MAGLEBY: No, I wasn&#039;t. I was only watching it as a good friend to the Chomor
family, and they were so involved. I was hoping and praying that it would work
for them, but it didn&#039;t.

ARBONA: I wanted to also ask you, I&#039;ve read in different places, reports that
some people when they left the town actually did pass away. They did die
because, either directly or indirectly, depending on how one interprets it, that
really the separation from home was so difficult, and it also broke a lot of
social bonds. Did you know of any people like that?

MAGLEBY: I did not. I did not. But that could very easily have happened because
they were in agony, and the tremendous pull on their hearts was bad, but I did
not know of anyone. I could imagine it could have happened, but talking directly
with those people, you may find that out. But I did not know anyone personally.

ARBONA: I wonder also about, you mentioned the mutiny and the mutiny trial, and
so many things changed after the war. The military changed from a segregated
institution to an integrated institution. Did you notice any changes in Port
Chicago, for example, that any African-American families move in, or did some of
the composition change?

MAGLEBY: No, because I wasn&#039;t that intimately involved with the town. Once the
war was over, once I quit my job to go to school, I didn&#039;t have that much
connection with Port Chicago. I did know people who came from there, the Lichti
family. I think Otto Lichti was the judge there. But I did not have that much
connection with them after the war was over and especially after I left the
Naval Magazine and went to school.

I was delighted when the war ended, of course, and that meant that no more
loading ships, no more explosions because we weren&#039;t loading any ships to go
anywhere. V-E Day early in the year and V-J Day later in the year, and it was
over, and I think that was 1945, as I recall. So after that, then things settled
down until Port Chicago knew that their town was going to be taken from them,
and I only felt agony for them at that time.

ARBONA: But then the Korean War came around.

MAGLEBY: Yes. That was not anything in particular to me because it was a war
that was called because of their problems there, but servicemen became
servicemen starting 1940-41 on and on and on due to conflicts throughout the
world, Korean War being one of them. But I was not intimately involved in any of
that either. That was a world situation, and men that were in World War II went
back and joined the Army or whatever to be a part of fighting for America in the
Korean War.

ARBONA: I was wondering if you have any recollections during the Vietnam War and
in this vicinity. Did you know people, for example, from Port Chicago that went
and fought or hearing stories of that?

MAGLEBY: No, I don&#039;t. I don&#039;t. All I know is the Vietnam War was &quot;how do I get
out of going?&quot; That was the thought on the minds of so many. Many wanted to go
to serve in the Army, and that was those very, very patriotic people who wanted
to serve. But there were a lot, I would almost say half and half, would say &quot;not
me, boy; don&#039;t send me over there.&quot; And so that was the conflict that we had at
that time. Some who said, &quot;I&#039;m not going,&quot; and some who said, &quot;I&#039;m going to go
because it&#039;s the patriotic thing to do.&quot;

ARBONA: So let&#039;s talk a little bit about the post Port Chicago, after that
condemnation. Oh, there&#039;s your phone.

[tape pause]

ARBONA: Okay, so I&#039;m just making sure we&#039;re rolling again. Let me see if I can
remember what I just asked you.

MAGLEBY: Exactly.

ARBONA: Well, I had asked you about the post-Port Chicago. How did that affect
the community of Bay Point or what was then West Pittsburg. You mentioned that
they left the town, of course.

MAGLEBY: Okay. I can only talk to a couple of instances because on my street
there was one really nice family that moved in from Port Chicago. In Shore Acres
the Chomor family moved in there, and I was in their house many, many times.
There were maybe, as far as me personally, only about four or five families that
I knew who moved in into Bay Point. Most of them moved into Concord, and some
moved other places, but they had to find a house; they had to find a place to
live. And so they bought where they could, and I&#039;m sure the Navy made
arrangements for them. I&#039;m not sure that they were happy with the financial
deals; I&#039;m not sure at all. But, as far as getting away from Port Chicago, they
did. And I know of maybe four families that moved into Bay Point, especially the
Chomor family, the DiMarco family and a couple of others, but they continued on
with life.

ARBONA: It sounds like they didn&#039;t, of course, want to move very far?

MAGLEBY: They didn&#039;t want to move far; no, they didn&#039;t. So then there was
housing to be found in those days, especially in Bay Point in the Shore Acres
area and, as I said, on my street, right up the street, there were vacant lots
that people built a house. But I don&#039;t know the intimate details of their--of
course there were lots of people moving, but I only of four families that moved
into Bay Point. There could have been a lot more, but I don&#039;t know them.

ARBONA: But you have the Ambrose Park not too far from here, correct?

MAGLEBY: The Ambrose Park district, yes, but did not include Port Chicago, but
the Ambrose Park district includes part of the Pittsburg area and all of Bay
Point. But the Ambrose Park district is made up of the community center, which
is on Willow Pass Road right downtown Bay Point, and the park, which was a
donation; the land was a donation, from Clementine Enes of the Enes family who
built this house. This house and the houses in Enes tract where I live were
built by the Antoine Enes family and, I think, his sons, Bernard, Alfred and
others. There were four brothers that were contractors and built this tract.
They started building this in 1940, maybe &#039;41, and lo and behold came World War
II, so when we moved to California because my father got a job here, of course,
there was housing, lots of housing to buy.

We bought this house for $4,500 in 1942, moved in in 1943, but that was because
they had to finish the housing. And, by the way, that was a good time to build
houses because you could use the bona fide redwood hardwood. All of these houses
are built of redwood hardwood, and they give and take, redwood hardwood does,
with earthquakes. It shifts, kind of. I learned that. I don&#039;t know how much more
there is to know about that, but I learned it. I&#039;m glad I live in a house that
will give a little bit with an earthquake because it doesn&#039;t just crumble. The
redwood hardwood gives with earthquakes, so I&#039;m glad for that, truly glad.

ARBONA: Well, it sounds from what you said a little bit earlier that the yearly
reunion of the Port Chicago town, Port Chicago people, is in Ambrose Park in
what is contemporary Bay Point--

MAGLEBY: Right.

ARBONA: So it sounds like this is a little bit of a new nucleus of the
community, is that fair to say?

MAGLEBY: No, the Ambrose district has been going sixty years; 1946 was when the
Ambrose district was organized. It has been going for many, many years, and it
was the place that people went, the Ambrose Park, because it&#039;s in a little
ravine type, and there you find just a little hidden treasure where the Ambrose
Park is, but that&#039;s only part of the district. The district includes three or
four other little parks and Anuta Park, and, of course, the Ambrose Center,
which was the house or the schoolhouse for a long time, an elementary school in
Bay Point, and it was bought by the Ambrose district, and that&#039;s where our
center of this community is now, the Ambrose Community Center, 3105 Willow Pass
Road in Bay Point, which was at that time West Pittsburg.

You understand, the situation between the name Pittsburg and West Pittsburg and
Bay Point all of those communities had the same zip code, so it&#039;s pretty hard to
differentiate sometimes between which is which. When we moved to California, we
thought we were moving to Pittsburg, and we were delighted that it was
Pittsburg, but it was a little community at the side of Pittsburg, and some of
the people who lived here called it West Pittsburg. And then, of course, in the
mid-nineties there were some people who said, &quot;Well, do you realize that this
entire area was once Bay Point?&quot; At one time it was Bay Point.

I&#039;ll tell you a quick story; maybe I told this already. In 1857 the first school
district organized in Contra Costa County was a district from Railroad Avenue in
Pittsburg to Pacheco. That school district was called Bay Point School District.
So that will tell you that Bay Point was a lot bigger than the little community
that we see now. It had the name from way back, a lot bigger than it is now. But
then the community that was Port Chicago called themselves Bay Point, and they
decided they didn&#039;t like the name and changed it to Port Chicago. So Bay Point
has a name good and bad. Some people didn&#039;t like it, and now some people still
don&#039;t like it because they took the West Pittsburg name away and named it Bay
Point. But when you get it all together, the name Bay Point is bigger than this
little community will ever be.

ARBONA: Because it sounds like at one point it was used loosely for a district,
and at the same time it was the name of Port Chicago before they existed over in
the thirties.

MAGLEBY: Exactly.

ARBONA: So how about that name change from West Pittsburg to Bay Point? Why did
that happen?

MAGLEBY: Well, I think it happened because people found out that the genealogy
of this area was Bay Point. And they said well, why don&#039;t we go back and why
don&#039;t we call it Bay Point? Because West Pittsburg seemed like an appendage to
another town, like not our own community, but, of course, the people who really
loved the name West Pittsburg were adamant against changing it. We had meetings
where there was very vociferous language spoken. It was sad to see that there
was such a divide between those who said &quot;why don&#039;t we call it Bay Point&quot; and
those who said &quot;don&#039;t you dare call it Bay Point; it&#039;s West Pittsburg.&quot; Those
people still will not call it Bay Point. They insist on calling it West
Pittsburg, which is their privilege, their right to do, because it has history.
It will always be an historical name. As a matter of fact, when I organized a
Bay Point Historical Society, the object of that historical society was to
preserve the names of Bay Point, Clyde, Nichols, Port Chicago and West
Pittsburg. None of those names will ever be lost, as far as I am concerned,
because the Bay Point Historical Society will keep them alive for as long as we can.

ARBONA: It sounds like you were very active when this name change--

MAGLEBY: Yes, that&#039;s the first activity I ever got into because I was going to
school, I had a job. I wasn&#039;t interested in this little town I lived in, but all
of a sudden things changed, and it changed with the name change. I was not
adamant about it, but I thought it was a good idea. Bay Point sounded good to
me, and West Pittsburg didn&#039;t have any real glamour or glory, and it didn&#039;t have
any. I didn&#039;t cling to that name, so I was willing to vote for a Bay Point name.
I worked on it, not extensively, but I did sign petitions and had other people
sign petitions, and then we finally got permission from, I think, the League of
Women Voters. They said they would have an election. Sure enough, we had an
election. They sent out mailers to everybody that lived in Bay Point or West
Pittsburg then, and said which name would you choose? And they chose, the
majority chose Bay Point. So it was over when the election was held, the name
Bay Point became official. The names on the streets were changed to Entrance to
Bay Point; Entrance to Bay Point was the name then that was given to all of our
community. And we had then the Bay Point everything, so that was the difference,
and I think that was 1994, if I&#039;m not correct. I think it was; we can check that out.

ARBONA: We could, yeah. What do you think divided people? Why would some people
cling to West Pittsburg, and what maybe identified the folks that wanted Bay Point?

MAGLEBY: Oh, I think it was the fact that the people that wanted it Bay Point
that first started out were new to the area. They were genealogists and new to
the area, and those that were old timers here. Of course I&#039;m an old timer, but I
think young, so I was not so taken back. But those who had lived here forever
said, &quot;What? You&#039;re not going to change the name of our town.&quot; And I think they
were angry more with the people who started the program or started the process,
more than the fact that it was going to be changed. They said, and those people
who helped change the name will ever be remembered as &quot;those people helped
change the name of our town.&quot; So there are still people who won&#039;t call it Bay Point.

ARBONA: Now when you say new, new people, do you mean new from completely out of
the State of California, or--?

MAGLEBY: No, well, yes, yes. Some of them completely away from--they lived here,
maybe came here in 1990. Well, that&#039;s way late in time for Bay Point or for West
Pittsburg. And if you come to our town and then you want to change the name, you
better not. But it was successful because of the fact that when they looked on
the computer and looked for Bay Point there, they found a zip code 94565, which
is the Pittsburg zip code. And they said, &quot;Whoa, the post office knows about Bay
Point. Why don&#039;t we name the town Bay Point?&quot; And that&#039;s what started it all,
the fact that they found the zip code for Bay Point the same as Pittsburg zip
code. So they said the name is genealogically correct; let&#039;s change the name.
And really it was a boon to this community, Bay Point is known far and wide for
Bay Point, not any more West Pittsburg. But West Pittsburg is historical, and we
never denigrate the name.

ARBONA: So it didn&#039;t necessarily have anything to do with the families from Port
Chicago that wanted to go back to a previous name of Port Chicago then.

MAGLEBY: No, not really. Well, it resembled that same thing because in those
days in Bay Point and Port Chicago, the change from Bay Point to Port Chicago
created all kinds of stir, too. There were two sides to that story also. But
you&#039;re going to find that with people who their family history says Bay Point or
their family history says Port Chicago, they don&#039;t want it changed. They don&#039;t
want it lost. So the West Pittsburg people said, &quot;Leave it alone; don&#039;t change
our name.&quot; But now people have been born in Bay Point say, &quot;Don&#039;t mess with Bay
Point. Let&#039;s keep it that way.&quot; It&#039;s just a matter of opinion, and it happens
every time you try to change something. It means forgetting something in the
past, and people don&#039;t like to do that.

ARBONA: So from being somebody who signed petitions and maybe, you know,
participated in different elections or ballots, you then it sounds like you
started to become much more active beyond ballots and beyond--

MAGLEBY: I did indeed. I did indeed, and let me explain--

ARBONA: How did that happen?

MAGLEBY: Let me explain how that happened. In 1996 Mr. Seeno, the Seeno that
builds the houses here, S E E N O, wanted to build a casino outside of the
boundaries of Bay Point just a little ways. I keep saying I could throw a rock
and hit the spot, but I couldn&#039;t. But it was to the west of us and a little bit
to the south, and they had visions of a casino being built there, Albert Seeno
and the people that lived in Bay Point and in Western Pittsburg, you&#039;ve got to
be careful to say Western Pittsburg, not West Pittsburg, said, &quot;We&#039;re not going
to put up with a casino in our back door.&quot; So I joined with a group from Western
Pittsburg and Bay Point fighting against the casino that wanted to be built at
our doorstep almost. And we worked very hard on it. We spent about $10,000,
raised it somehow, and Mr. Seeno spent $300,000. And we worked very, very hard,
went door to door and finally got the City of Pittsburg to say, &quot;Well, let&#039;s let
the voters decide.&quot; And so that meant that we had to reach to the voters, and so
we went to every house in Pittsburg, not Bay Point. We couldn&#039;t even vote on it.
It was a Pittsburg thing. But I worked very hard on it, and the people against
the casino won two-thirds to one-third. It was a huge victory for us having
spent so little and Mr. Seeno having spent so much. And we won decisively. After
that I was on such a high that I thought I could do anything.

So then I ran for election on the Bay Point Municipal Advisory Council and won
that election. And in 2001 I decided that it was time to revive the Bay Point
Pride. It was called the West Pittsburg Pride, and nothing had been done since
the name change. And so I revived the Bay Point Pride, and those people who ran
the West Pittsburg Pride were very adamant that it wasn&#039;t going to happen, but
it did. And it&#039;s been going now for ten years, and we&#039;re celebrating that very
thing on August 12 at the Ambrose Recreation and Park District and will be at
the community center where we&#039;ll receive certificates from Senator Torlakson or
from Assembly person Torlakson now for the ten years that we&#039;ve had the Bay
Point Pride. The Bay Point Pride covers over graffiti that comes on every
community; we try to paint ugly houses that maybe they don&#039;t have money to
paint. And so we get free paint and have volunteers and go paint the houses. We
clean up vacant yards and do things like that. We have to buy a lot of weed
eaters because weed eaters give out, and we have to buy new ones every so often.

We also have a little program in the Bay Point Pride called Yard of the Month.
And five sections of Bay Point get a certificate and $25 every month for ten
years to say you have the best yard in your neighborhood, or you have a
beautiful yard, so you win Yard of the Month for August 2010. And so we&#039;re going
to celebrate ten years of that; that means 600 yards when you add it all up have
been given Yard of the Month.

You&#039;ll notice over on the side of my wall there&#039;s a sign that says Yard of the
Month. That&#039;s the sign we plant in their yard. You won. You&#039;re a winner. Then we
give them the $25 certificate from one of the stores. Sometimes it&#039;s Ace
Hardware, mostly it&#039;s Home Depot. But it&#039;s worked that long.

Then after organizing that and it worked, I said, &quot;You know what? I think Bay
Point needs a historical society.&quot; And so lo and behold I got the people that I
knew that were old timers here together, and we organized the Bay Point
Historical Society, and that&#039;s where I say our job is the preserve the histories
of Bay Point, Nichols, Clyde, Port Chicago and West Pittsburg and so that
society has been going now since 2003.

In 2003 I was chair of the Bay Point Municipal Advisory Council so I had a
little bit of clout to be able to go ahead and decided Bay Point needs a Chamber
of Commerce. And so 2003 I organized the Bay Point Chamber of Commerce. Since
that time we have had about fifty members, not all from Bay Point, people who
sell in Bay Point. For example, Allied Waste, the garbage company. They have
always belonged, and they are in Pacheco. We have the Pittsburg Disposal,
they&#039;re in Pittsburg. We have Ready Print, which is in Pittsburg.

But the Bay Point Chamber of Commerce is going strong, and we keep it going
because this community has twenty-three, maybe twenty-five thousand people. They
deserve representation in a business community, and the people who have stores
here deserve accolades for them, for keeping their stores open. There&#039;s still
vacant property here. We want the economic growth in Bay Point to truly grow,
and so that&#039;s what the Chamber of Commerce does. We meet once a month in a
luncheon and have speakers there. We sponsor the Bay Point parade that happens
on Memorial Day every year. We handle the memorial service, and we foot the
money for the parade and the festival.

So the Bay Point Chamber of Commerce is alive and well, and it&#039;s so nice to have
members on the board who are site managers of our big industry and who are
managers and owners of the small industry here. It&#039;s a beautiful combination,
huge industries joining and small businesses joining together to promote this
little community. It&#039;s a thrill to see it.

ARBONA: So you would say that it was, it sounds from the math and the years that
you mentioned that it was around the year 2000?

MAGLEBY: Right.

ARBONA: That Bay Point Pride was organized.

MAGLEBY: Exactly.

ARBONA: You read sometimes in the newspapers about issues like crime and other
community concerns. Was that part of the I&#039;d say agenda at that time, or was
that part of the concern that--?

MAGLEBY: Not really. Not really at all because we were doing what we felt was
the proper thing to do to prevent crime and that&#039;s to have a beautiful
community. If you have a clean, nice community, you have less crime. If you have
a tacky community and one window broken you&#039;re going to have blight immediately
and crime. So our job was to make the community more beautiful and more
accessible and open more stores and have more businesses promote this little
community, and that would handle any crime, and it certainly has. The crime rate
in Bay Point is no bigger than it is in Alamo or Danville, and that&#039;s a pleasure
to always say because we are not in a position where we are afraid at all. What
we want to do in Bay Point is make it cleaner and better, and that brings people
to dress up nicer and to act better. The whole thing goes together.

Then, of course, one more thing I thought about, and that was a garden club, so
2004 I organized a garden club, or I founded it. And it&#039;s going now. They&#039;re the
people who actually handle the parade. The Chamber of Commerce provides the
money, and the Bay Point Garden Club handles the parade, including, of course,
the garden club does a lot more than just the parade. They do talk about
plantings and what to plant in Bay Point, and we have our own little garden
section where we have, right next to the Ambrose Center is the community
gardens. So you can buy a plot there, and it&#039;s been going for almost a year,
maybe more now. So it all adds up to a community that is involved, and that was
my main point, get people involved.

I can say that since the organization of all these groups that maybe over 500
people have been involved. And that&#039;s a good feeling because that&#039;s 500 people
that weren&#039;t involved before who now say, &quot;I&#039;ll join your group,&quot; or &quot;I&#039;ll be on
that committee,&quot; or &quot;How about we go paint the church over there because they
need some help?&quot; And so we get free paint, but we have to buy a lot of things to
go with it for the Pride, the Chamber, the Historical Society, and the Garden
Club, so we are a community. And LAFCO who decides what can be a community and
what can&#039;t, can look at our community and say, &quot;We better not disrupt them.
They&#039;re going fine.&quot; And that&#039;s one of the reasons I think that I did it,
although I wouldn&#039;t be adamant against being annexed to Pittsburg. I&#039;m just not
that kind. I look at both sides and say what is the best for the community, what
is the best for Bay Point.

ARBONA: So this is a possibility, that they&#039;d annex Bay Point to--

MAGLEBY: We are in their sphere of influence. S-O-I, sphere of influence, and if
they wanted to, they could annex us. If LAFCO said, &quot;That sounds like a good
idea,&quot; but if LAFCO said, &quot;I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to work. I think this
little community should stay by itself. They have their own groups; they have
their little civic groups and community groups, and I don&#039;t know that they need
to be annexed.&quot; On the other hand, it could very easily happen. If Pittsburg
said, &quot;Look what we could provide for you. You&#039;ve waited a long time for the
waterfront to be developed. We could do that overnight because we have the money
and the county is broken, or broke. Not broken, but broke. The county has no
money, and we do.&quot; So, you know, there&#039;s a way to resolve all kinds of things
like that, but all I do is look at both sides and make the decision what is best
for Bay Point?

ARBONA: The name you mentioned, is that the Mayor? I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t, it
doesn&#039;t, LAFCO--

MAGLEBY: LAFCO is the group that tells you whether you can, they organize,
they&#039;re the ones who say, &quot;You can be a city or you can&#039;t,&quot; or &quot;You can annex
this or you can&#039;t.&quot; That is the local area formation committee.

ARBONA: At the county level.

MAGLEBY: At the county level. Yes. So that&#039;s just the name that we always say,
&quot;LAFCO might let them do it. Maybe LAFCO won&#039;t.&quot; They&#039;re people that&#039;s a
community group.

ARBONA: Let me see how we&#039;re doing on time real quick, well, it does, we might
have time for one or two more questions here.

MAGLEBY: Okay.

ARBONA: I think that we&#039;ve covered more or less a lot of what I had on the
outline, but this might be jumping back a little bit, but I was wondering if I
could throw it in there just to ask you how you would like to see Port Chicago remembered.

MAGLEBY: Oh, I think Port Chicago should be remembered as the sweet little
community it was. You can&#039;t have a little town that had so much fun together,
that had their own mayor, their own bank, their own chamber of commerce. You
can&#039;t wipe that out and have it not be remembered. It is remembered with
sweetness and always will be because they didn&#039;t do anything wrong. They didn&#039;t
do anything wrong. They just lived there, but they were wiped out anyway. And
that&#039;s big government that does things like that sometimes, and maybe we can say
certainly the Army and the Navy and so forth. But when you think about a little
community that didn&#039;t do anything wrong and yet had their town wiped out, the
sweetness that was there will always be remembered, not only by the people who
lived there, but by the people who were round about who said, &quot;That can&#039;t
happen,&quot; but it did.

ARBONA: Was there ever a presence in common places in, say, restaurants or other
places of leisure where you&#039;d see the officials or military people that were on
the other side of the Port Chicago condemnation?

MAGLEBY: No. The military people never spoke about whether it was good or bad.
It came mostly from, I&#039;m thinking, from Washington, DC, and that&#039;s about as
simple as how it is. It didn&#039;t come from local Army or Navy, I&#039;m sure, but it
came from the higher ups and they were far, far away from that little community.
I still think it was a shame, but we can&#039;t bring it back. Can&#039;t bring it back.

ARBONA: The soldiers, more employees of the base, was there any relation to
them, or would they just stay on base? I&#039;m trying to understand more or less how
they mixed in.

MAGLEBY: They probably went out to dinner with Port Chicago people. I&#039;m sure.
They were the Navy people there, and I&#039;m sure they were invited to lunch in Port
Chicago and other places around. But they didn&#039;t take a stand. I&#039;m sure they
didn&#039;t because I don&#039;t think they realized what was going to happen, and when it
finally did happen, they were long gone. But the servicemen in Port Chicago that
were loading those ships, they were friends, a lot of friends locally, and the
African Americans who were loading the ships had friends in Pittsburg. I know
some of those today, and it&#039;s a thrill to visit with them and to know them and
realize their position.

Eddie Hart, who was an Olympic champion, and his father were at Port Chicago,
and all of those people do remember. But they don&#039;t have bitterness. They don&#039;t
have a lot of bitterness now. It&#039;s over, and let&#039;s build a life. Let&#039;s look to
the future, and they certainly do. Eddie Hart and his father are very active in
Pittsburg, and I&#039;m part of their activity, support them all the way.

ARBONA: These actually might be--you mentioned those names. I think we might
want to get in touch with some of those folks if you have their contact info.

MAGLEBY: You could do that, and I can put you in touch with Eddie Hart&#039;s family.
I&#039;ll certainly do that because he remembers.

ARBONA: Also before we run out of tape I&#039;ll just ask you if there&#039;s anything
else that strikes you as important that you haven&#039;t mentioned, that&#039;s somewhere
in the back of your mind that you wanted to say.

MAGLEBY: I&#039;m sure there is something because living here this long and going to
Mt. Diablo High School. Mt. Diablo High School, as I have said before, was at
that time the premier high school in California and maybe in the nation. It had
a fabulous record, and so many went to college after they graduated. The scores
were so high. It was a great place to go to school, and we still revere our
going to school there, and I think I told you this, that we have a meeting once
a month during school time where we take the kids and say, &quot;This is how good we
thought this school was.&quot; And they&#039;re saying, &quot;We think it&#039;s good, too.&quot; And
we&#039;re building self-esteem in them right today. But if there&#039;s anything I&#039;ve
left out, I will be in touch with you because I certainly want this, I am
interested in history as much as anybody. And I have a long way to go in this
life, so who knows what&#039;s left to come. But I&#039;m looking to the future, and I&#039;m
still organizing. If you want a job, come and see me, you&#039;ll be on my committee.

ARBONA: That might be very important after a PhD.

MAGLEBY: Yeah, it should be. We need PhDs.

ARBONA: Well, thanks a lot for your time Ms. Magleby, and I think we&#039;ll just
wrap up the tape right there, and I&#039;ll just hit the pause button.

MAGLEBY: I thank you; you&#039;re very good to work with.

ARBONA: Thank you.
