CASTLE: Just start again by, tell me your name, the year you were born, and
where you were born.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Okay, ready?

CASTLE: She&#039;s talking to me.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: My English name is Ruth Ann Hopper. My married name, I should
say. My maiden name was Sarracino. Both of my parents worked for the railroad
and got married, I guess, in the forties, and then I was born in Albuquerque,
New Mexico. She came home to have me. Same with my sister. There are only two of
us that are the siblings. She basically did the same thing, we were both born in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. Then later on we returned to Richmond.

CASTLE: And what nation are you from?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I&#039;m from the Laguna tribe, one of the nineteen different kind
of pueblos in Laguna. My home is actually at Encinal, which is where the Laguna
tribal reservation, one of the seven villages--

CASTLE: That make up the whole.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: That make up the tribe.

CASTLE: What year were you born?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I was born May 1, 1948.

CASTLE: Then your first few--how soon was it--did you spend time on the
reservation, here at Encinal, before you--?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes I did. I got to know my grandparents and my aunt and her
brothers and sisters, some returned from the war later on, and that was when we
used to come home and also visit too. They would just go back and forth, you
know, all the time. [telephone rings, interview interruption]

CASTLE: So we were just talking about--so you were just born, in the last part
of our interview. [laughter] In Albuquerque, and you are the second of two
girls, yes?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: So where were we? Continue to tell me about your life after birth,
starting with Albuquerque. Then what happened? You came home from the hospital? [laughter]

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I came home from the hospital, I stayed here.

CASTLE: You were here--how long were you on your reservation before you went?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Probably--

CASTLE: You&#039;re not going to remember necessarily, but--

SARRACINO-HOPPER: By the pictures I&#039;ve seen, my mother took me back I guess, I
was not nine months old. Then she brought us back again. Anyway, I remember the
last picture she was going to show you was the lady carrying me on the cradle
board at the oven. That was--they built their ovens at that time. Then because I
wasn&#039;t in school, and we weren&#039;t in school yet, so we just were going back and
forth. So we did grow up with our grandparents and all we knew was our Indian
names and we talked Indian--they talked the language to us all the time. My
grandma didn&#039;t speak English, and my grandfather, apparently, later on, as I got
older, found out that he did understand and he did speak, but he spoke probably
like six different languages. But we just never knew.

But anyway, going to school though was interesting. Even at the village where we
lived in Richmond, everybody spoke their language. It really wasn&#039;t like
English, like, well, it depended I guess, on the family home. In our family home
my dad always spoke Indian to us and my mom. So it was like when you got to
Richmond, you&#039;re still speaking the language and so when I first went to
kindergarten, I guess I was like Irvin. I ran away from class. My neighbor
that&#039;s older than me and my sister, he was a traffic boy, and the kindergarten
room was right down at Perry School {?} all the way to the other end of the
block. I went into class and I just came back out. I would get to the corner and
he was just about to leave and I was crossing the street, and he would say,
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; &quot;I&#039;m going home.&quot; &quot;No you&#039;re not.&quot; Then he&#039;d walk me back
to my class, the first three days of class. He would come and check on me to see
if I was still in class. [laughter]

CASTLE: Oh really.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It was interesting because since I didn&#039;t grow up with Ruth
and my grandmother and grandpa called me their granddaughter in Indian, and then
my mother, same thing, in Indian.

CASTLE: What is your Indian name?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: My name is {? Roytsiasa?} and so I never really heard Ruth too
much. Or I don&#039;t remember hearing Ruth until I went to kindergarten and you have
to write your name of course, right? So she would show us how to write and stuff
like that. That was kind of interesting because I don&#039;t really remember the Ruth
part. [laughter] Because I grew up as Linda here. You know, all these years,
going back and forth as Linda Lou, until I went to school, and that&#039;s kind of
where it kicked in I guess, as far as my name was Ruth. Or they would call me
Ann, once in a while, my grandma, my dad&#039;s mother. Other than that--

CASTLE: So in kindergarten it would be a really strange experience because not
only are you going in in this totally different language that you&#039;re hearing,
but you don&#039;t even hear a name that you recognize.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: So that would be really alienating.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes. And then of course, from then on, it&#039;s like you practice
your writing, writing your name, and you hear it all the time. But it didn&#039;t
work that way because when I would come home, even in Richmond, the neighbors
and the kids knew me as Linda. Then we would go to school.

CASTLE: Was Ruth on your registration papers? How did Ruth--

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, it was on my registration papers. It was on everything I
wrote that was my paper, like for your assignments at school. I think I stayed
Linda for a long time. Like my uncle that came, he knows me as Linda also.
Everybody from here knows me as Linda. Then later on--don&#039;t ask me how I got
Belle--but then my name was Belle. It was like Linda Lou, but it was Irvin&#039;s
sister that was named Linda also, so they just called me Linda Belle. But here
I&#039;m Linda Lou. So even when I come home, nobody knew my last name, even when I
got married they still thought I was a Sarracino, and they still called me Linda.

CASTLE: So that&#039;s a lot of different names.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: But you hear my mother though, she&#039;ll always say, &quot;Ruth Ann.&quot;
When she&#039;s introducing me, she&#039;ll say &quot;Ruth Ann.&quot; Like say, I just now met you,
she&#039;ll introduce me as Ruth Ann. Because as I got older, into like junior high
school, and we would go--they would take us everywhere. Actually, they took us
everywhere when we were little, though. She would introduce me as Ruth Ann, but
everybody just like knew me as Linda.

CASTLE: What point in school did you--

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Even Irvin knew me as Linda. Like when I talk to him on the
phone, I tell him, &quot;This is Linda. Linda Lou, Linda Belle.&quot; He&#039;ll say, &quot;Oh,
okay.&quot; [laughter]

CASTLE: So now he knows.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: You&#039;re comfortable now with all these different ways that you&#039;re named?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, because like when I come home, I&#039;m Linda, when I go there
I&#039;m Ruth. Even though on my birth certificate it doesn&#039;t say--Ruth is in there,
but that&#039;s not my first name. [laughter] Kind of interesting. Same with my
sister. Everybody knows her as Buchy {?} when she&#039;s home, not Joanne. They know
her as Joanne, because my uncle gave her that name, so she grew up with Joanne.
A lot of time people just knew her as Buchy.

CASTLE: So when you&#039;re in school, this is at Perry&#039;s? School?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Perry&#039;s School. {?}

CASTLE: What point did you start to--how long did it take for you to learn
English or start to feel comfortable in the classroom, and do you remember being
treated any differently because of how people saw you?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No, I think because I was kind of quiet and shy, so I really
didn&#039;t. I had friends at school, I made friends and stuff. But coming home, like
my mother would come--the mothers would come so far to meet us and then they
would walk us home. Or like my dad would walk us to--half-way to school. He
usually was at work, but on days when he wasn&#039;t he would walk us. Usually my
mother would walk us. Some of the ladies they walked us to school.

CASTLE: How far was school? What was the walk like?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It was dirt road, just like home. [laughter]

CASTLE: Just like the res.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Just like the res, dirt road. Maybe it was like three,
four--six blocks long. It wasn&#039;t too far. Then when we got to junior high
school, school was like thirty-six blocks away plus going through A and B
Street, thirty-nine, going over the viaduct{?} forty--forty-two, forty-three,
forty-five blocks if you wanted to do it. A lot of times we walked over the
viaduct, caught the bus and went to school, but going to Roosevelt Junior High
School we just walked to school.

Over the viaduct to school and back.

CASTLE: Describe that for me. What were the railroad grounds like? Where did you
live? Where did you eat? Where did you play? Give me a sense, geographically, of
the space that you--what the Indian village was like.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Well, by the time all the families got family homes, they were
duplexes, they were two boxcars and the middle was like--it was shaped like an H
but the middle were basically a little block added to the middle which were the
bathrooms and the showers and the kitchen. Everybody cooked on the wood stove.
They had a woodpile that we all went to chop wood, or our fathers did, and bring
wood home. That&#039;s what heated the water. We had a water tank, it was attached to
the wood stove, and there was hot water all the time by building the fire. After
that, it didn&#039;t change much, actually, after we got there and that I can
remember, except that when they built the last new homes, which we were move in,
but then since there was not very many Acomas left at that time, then they moved
into those homes, which were more of a HUD housing kind of a style. They were
also duplexes but there was only four--two duplexes that were four families, and
then one more Acoma family at the end of that that lived in the style of boxcars
that we had. That was when they tore down the Acoma--that became the Acoma
village which was made of the older boxcars, which were that deep red burgundy
color. That&#039;s where they had the community shower stalls for the women and men,
showers and bathrooms. Then they tore--when most of the families from there
retired or got laid off, most of them got laid off, at that time then they moved
home. That left only those six, five families, left at that time. The rest were
all Laguna. By the time 1970 there was only two families of Acoma left in
Richmond. Those were the Garcias and the Sanchezes.

CASTLE: Let&#039;s--we&#039;ll trace back through that chronology. If we can go back to
kind of fifties sort of, in addition to the boxcar and the spaces, the homes
that you&#039;re describing, what else? Was there a main meeting space? What are the
other buildings that were involved in your daily experience?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: The railroad decided, because the men requested, so they built
them a hall, a meeting hall.

CASTLE: The Santa Fe Railroad?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: The Santa Fe Railroad. So that became our little community
center. The men had meetings there. Us kids, the older kids, used to have a
record hop. Then later on as we got older we still continued it and we had a
dance on Friday night, we had a record hop. Sometimes the guys that played,
which was a couple of them, then they would play, they would practice there, and
play guitars and stuff.

CASTLE: How old were you?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Hmm.

CASTLE: Teenager?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Teenager. Sixteen at the time I got to go, kind of go more out
and do things.

CASTLE: Yes.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: But at elementary school though, the teachers actually kind of
worked with the parents, and our principal, he was nice. But what ended up at
the elementary school was that they used to do field trips to the village, to
the Richmond village. The teachers would--

CASTLE: Take a whole class?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Take a whole class and do a field trip. The women would
prepare food and bake bread and then they would go to this hall, our rec hall,
our meeting hall, and they would serve them there and they would tell them about
our tribe.

CASTLE: Would you be a part of this? Like were you ever part of a class that
went to your own village? I mean, when you think about it--

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No, I don&#039;t think so.

CASTLE: You just knew that that happened.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I just knew that that happened because the older kids at that
time were ahead of us. Those were the ones that, at that time, they were in
those classrooms that went on a field trip to the village. I don&#039;t know--I guess
that was just arranged with the principal and I guess someone that knew that we
lived there. Then junior high school was--and I remember a lot of the kids that
were there. It&#039;s interesting, my mom and dad would walk downtown, like when I
was in high school and they would stop and ask them, &quot;Oh, you&#039;re the Sarracinos,
right?&quot; It was kind of like--from grade school we all remember each other still.
I think because we actually really got along and our teachers, with the projects
that we did.

CASTLE: So wait, the teachers remembered you? Or others?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: The teachers and the kids, the ones we grew up with.

CASTLE: The non-Indian kids?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: The non-Indian kids. They would see our parents down town and
they would always ask them. Then we got to high school. At junior high they
split us up and we ended up going to Roosevelt Junior High School, where our
older brothers and sisters went to.

CASTLE: They split us up.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: They hadn&#039;t changed the boundaries of the school district yet.
But when we got to high school, all our brothers and sisters that were older
than us went to Richmond High. Then by the time I got to high school, in 1963
they changed the boundaries so I went to Harry Els {?} High School.

CASTLE: Where was that?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It was on Thirty-seventh Street, on MacDonald Avenue.

CASTLE: Was that a good change? Or was it bad?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It was kind of interesting because you see the different--

CASTLE: What was different?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I think it was kind of like, actually it&#039;s where we saw the
difference in class.

CASTLE: How is that? Describe that.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: In class where you had a lot more Caucasian kids, white kids,
going to school there that were from the hills that were considered kind
of--where their parents&#039; income were--

CASTLE: More money?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes. Then you had the kids from Point Richmond that were kind
of at that level too. Then you had us kids that were coming--the Mexicans and
the blacks and us going to that school, where Richmond High was more the
minority, mixed minority school, where there were hardly any white students
going to school there.

CASTLE: Was--do you remember feeling--a lot of people, when they get older, they
realize that they didn&#039;t have a lot when they grew up but they never really
noticed. Did you get any sense, did this make you feel any different? Did you
feel like you had less, whether you did or not?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No, really, I guess we felt okay, because we didn&#039;t ask for
much. I think it&#039;s just the way you are raised, and getting along with people
and sharing to begin with. Being taught that way.

CASTLE: Especially as a Pueblo cultural value.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, mm-hmm. But as kids living there we basically learned a
lot. It was like--leaving the reservation really was like a little copy of our
reservation there because we had a government, we had a curfew, the kids had a
curfew. So we had to be inside. [laughter]

CASTLE: The whole village?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: The whole village had a curfew.

CASTLE: What was that?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It was like no later than at ten o&#039;clock. Before it was at
nine. As we got older and whatever--because I think we were going out more with
our friends from the city than our sisters and brothers that were older than us.

CASTLE: I see.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Then, like my friends, my friends would come down into the
village and pick me up and we would go to shows sometimes, and that went on in
high school.

CASTLE: These are not--what kind of background were these friends?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: This didn&#039;t really happen until high school. I had three white
friends, one black girl, one Chicana girl, and me. We used to tease each other,
because she had a Cadillac, right, and she would drop all of us off, and they
would come into the village and drop me off and once in a while pick me up. We
would go to a show. One of the girls, we ended up doing stuff together and we
ended up, during the summer, like, &quot;Okay, let&#039;s become candy-stripers.&quot; So we
went to the Red Cross and we went through this whole schooling thing, and then
we ended up working at the veterans&#039; hospital in Martinez all summer long. It
was really good, though, because we got to go to every section of the hospital,
work in the laundry room, we got to see the operations from the dome. We went
into--we even--basically did everything, worked in the offices. It was a really
neat summer. But we didn&#039;t get paid.

CASTLE: I was going to say, how did you earn--what made you do that if you
weren&#039;t earning? Was it for the experience?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, I think it was for the experience. And we had fun. Then
we ended up working at the Napa state hospital, which was really interesting
because it was really weird.

Every time you go through a door it&#039;s locked. We only worked there for the
summer also. We got a chance to go back if we wanted to, during the holidays
when we were out of school. Then I don&#039;t thing--we didn&#039;t feel that comfortable
there, but it was interesting, to see how they treated people and their
patients. They even had their own canteen outside the state hospital, the ones
that were able to get out in the yard for a while and do stuff. Then my senior
year, her and I signed up to work at the Richmond hospital.

CASTLE: What was her name?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Sharon Key. Her dad--where did he work anyway? I think he
worked for the--now I can&#039;t remember. Her dad played the guitar too and he used
to like to tease us. Our other friend was Mary, that was in--they lived in
Atchison Village, so they were part of that group of people that kind of like
moved there also during that time.

CASTLE: Who lived in Atchison Village?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Sharon Key and Mary Martinez.

CASTLE: And what was the village? Who lived there?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Atchison Village was built there I guess after the war or
during the war when they needed housing and stuff. It&#039;s been there ever since I
can remember.

CASTLE: Right.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Anyway, her and I signed up for Richmond hospital, so we used
to work after school. Gosh, I think I&#039;ve been working since I was sixteen,
whether it was paid or not. It was just something that I guess I got to do. In
senior year of high school I played football.

CASTLE: You did!

SARRACINO-HOPPER: We had a girls&#039; football team.

CASTLE: A girls&#039; football team.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: A girls&#039; football team. I think the guys were mean to us
sometimes because they would make us do the whole routine, and some of the girls
were tall and we&#039;d have to go bounce each other--they&#039;d call a number and you&#039;d
go in the middle, you&#039;d come out. Or the girl would be in the middle and you&#039;d
come out and bump her. They made us run that field and they made us exercise and
stuff like that. But it was fun.

CASTLE: There&#039;s not a lot of girls&#039; football teams--how did this come about?
That&#039;s pretty advanced stuff.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: They used to have the powder puff football, flag football for
girls, right? The year I was there--

CASTLE: Took the puff away.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: So was it full-on tackle?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, it was full tackle. [laughter]

CASTLE: What did your parents think of this?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Well, I don&#039;t think they really knew, because it was just at
school, I didn&#039;t have to stay after school really.

CASTLE: You didn&#039;t tell them?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Hm-mm.

CASTLE: Do you think they would have had a problem with it?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It&#039;s in my yearbook though. I don&#039;t know if my yearbook&#039;s
around though.

CASTLE: Yes, I&#039;d love to see that picture. Actually this reminds me. I want to
ask you about coming of age and we talked a lot about how much time you spent
with your father. At what point in the village--you&#039;ve made quick reference to
things, but there was quite an infrastructure set up in the village, and that it
was a colony. Can you explain a little bit about the relationship between the
village and the home reservation and then the structure of it, government-wise
and security-wise?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I guess ever since I can remember they&#039;ve always had a
government. I know the history of basically how it came about. They elected
officers and they had a governor, a lieutenant governor, a treasurer, a
secretary. The {?} that they have here in the village.

CASTLE: The who?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: The meadowmus {?} they&#039;re the ones that are in charge of the
village, like--nowadays, in this time, they&#039;re like the village cleaner--like if
they&#039;re having a feast or something all the men have to go and work, or they do
ditch work. A long time ago it was ditch work because they did a lot of fills
and growing things. But nowadays they go around and clean the village to keep it
clean. In Richmond, they had fields, so they grew corn, tomatoes--the Acoma side
was near the Southern Pacific side by the fence, and the Laguna side was further
towards the railroad overcrossing.

CASTLE: So there was an actual separation between the Acoma and Laguna?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Different fields, yes. Because the Acomas lived in one end,
but right next door to us. So there was actually, then became an Acoma village
and then the Laguna village. But we did stuff together and all of the parents
participated in stuff like that and doing things for us kids. Then later on this
lady that worked for the Chevron company at Standard Oil, was--well, she was
Catholic and I guess that&#039;s one of the things that her and her friend did, when
she found out about us--and that was the older kids, like in what year--maybe
the early fifties--and they would come and teach catechism. Then we all did a
Christmas play. All us kids participated and our mothers made us our angel wings
and halos and stuff like that. We all had parts to play and after that we all
ate. That was before Christmas night, we had a play. Then on Christmas Eve,
though, we would all still have our traditional stuff.

CASTLE: Laguna traditional?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Laguna, yes, and Acomas also participated, but mostly the
Lagunas had their stuff. The village was basically like home. You had a village,
a community, that worked and shared and did stuff together. We had a meeting
hall, which was kind--I guess you could call it later on, kind of like where
they did some of their certain dances and cultural stuff and the women built
their outdoor ovens. Acoma built one and then the Lagunas built one. My uncle
that was first there, they had built their oven so that was her oven, but like
my mother would ask if she could use it. Then the ladies got together and then
they all built like a community oven, so there was two of them. It was
interesting how they got the sand for it, because they had to have a certain
kind of sand to build that oven. The sand they found was--I think it was on
private property or something, so they had--I have to ask--government or
whatever--so they went in to ask permission to haul sand from that place. That&#039;s
where they got that sand from to build their ovens and stuff.

CASTLE: So there was a lot of negotiation that was going on, maintaining Laguna
tribal life in the city space, still means there&#039;s times where you have to deal
with city jurisdiction. One of the things I&#039;m interested in knowing is how, from
what you remember, what was the relationship between the village and the city of
Richmond? Were they involved in village life?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: The language, the culture, fields like home.

CASTLE: When you say fields like home?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: You know, where you got to go and work. We used to come home
and then we would work in the field with my grandpa. Or at picking time we&#039;d
load up the kids and we&#039;d all go pick or irrigate with him and stuff like that.

CASTLE: Where is this?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: We passed it--

CASTLE: You were here in Laguna.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Here in Laguna. They had two fields, one on the Acoma side by
Southern Pacific, because Southern Pacific was right on the other side of the
fence they built. It was kind of like our back yard. We had a back yard but that
fence was Southern Pacific&#039;s on the other side of it.

CASTLE: That was their rail yard?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: That was their rail yard. Then we were on this side of the
fence which all belonged to Santa Fe. The Acomas had their field by the Southern
Pacific, like where their little workshop would be on that end, where I guess
Southern Pacific, the engineers or the what do you call them, the switch guys, I
forget what they&#039;re called. Anyway, they would go in that little place and I
guess like report.

CASTLE: The operators on the railroad? The cars would switch tracks?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, but it was like their little work place where they could
go and have coffee and like it was their little work site. Santa Fe had, like
the men, electricians, they had their shop, but they had a little place where
they&#039;d take a break. Anyway, the fields were on our end, but farther on, like
going to school.

CASTLE: This is where you grew stuff?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: For crops.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: My Uncle Sam had his garden. I forget who else had a garden
there. Anyway, he used to put me and his daughter in the wheelbarrow and he--the
wagon, and he used to pull us and take us to the field and then we&#039;d go and pick
tomatoes or something. He grew corn, tomatoes, melons and stuff right there.
Then later on, of course, we had tribal police on our reservation. Well, in
Richmond, we had a man that we called a special officer, but he was the special
agent for the railroad. They were the ones that like, if someone was riding in a
boxcar and the men caught him, that&#039;s who would go to pick them up and take them
wherever, or whatever.

Furey:

So {?}

SARRACINO-HOPPER: So what happened then was that he was in charge of the yard.
So police and City of Richmond had no jurisdiction, so they took care of the
village, they were kind of like the tribal police. The city couldn&#039;t have
jurisdiction, they couldn&#039;t do anything. A lot of times, the city didn&#039;t even
know we were there, except the police though, later on, they knew we were inside
the yard, but they couldn&#039;t do anything if anything happened, because it wasn&#039;t
their jurisdiction, it was private property. The special agent was kind of like
tribal police, because the city didn&#039;t have any jurisdiction.

CASTLE: Do you recall there ever being any issues? Any criminal problems or any
reason you needed to call the police?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No, not really. Except when people run into the village, then
the special agent would be the one to try to look or see what&#039;s happening,
because I guess the city police would let them know that someone has come into
the yard and stuff. He was the one that actually would do the arresting and
stuff like that.

CASTLE: So he was like a private security officer?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: Hired by the railroads. And it sounds like probably that there was an
understanding with the Richmond, the police, locally.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No, they didn&#039;t know, because--I remember the special officer
even telling him, &quot;You have no jurisdiction here,&quot; and the police kind of like,
were hesitant, and he had to explain it to them. Which was interesting, that
they had no jurisdiction into the company yard. Because what happened is that, I
guess the Mexican kids had done something and they caught our kids, the boys,
and they were bringing them, and then when the special officer got there he told
them, &quot;You can&#039;t take those boys, you have no jurisdiction.&quot; He explained it to
them so they left. It wasn&#039;t our--it wasn&#039;t the kids that lived in the village
that did anything. They just assumed they were Mexicans. [laughter] They even
didn&#039;t know really that we were inside the yard.

But the government part, as far as the governors of the village that were
elected, and the lieutenant governors, they actually were the ones to settle
stuff, or talk to the people, if there was, let&#039;s say there was a spouse dispute
or something, where they weren&#039;t getting along. I remember them coming after my
father when he was governor, to go talk to their husband or whatever. Or if
anything was going wrong, like with their kids sometimes. They would bring it up
at the meeting, when they had the regular meetings, I guess the government staff
for the tribe. They would talk about it, and then like my dad would come home
and we would be having breakfast by the time he would get back. Most of the
families all sat down at breakfast time when they&#039;d come back from the meetings.
I know my dad talked to us about the meeting, what went on.

CASTLE: He was out at the meeting all night?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No, during the morning, they had them early in the morning
before breakfast.

CASTLE: Oh, really early.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes. He would come home and he would tell us what went on at
the meeting. Or he would ask us questions about the kids, or if we knew anything
about stuff. Or he would remind us, &quot;You know, there&#039;s a curfew.&quot; [laughter] Or,
they switched the time for the curfew.

Furey:

Kurt wrote in his dissertation that one of the worst forms of punishment was to
send somebody back to the reservation.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, it was actually that strict. Because if you couldn&#039;t
control your children, and in order for discipline and whatever, they would
actually send the kids home. They had to find a place for them with their aunts
or uncles, or you know. But that didn&#039;t happen too often.

CASTLE: I was going to ask, how often did it happen? It did happen.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It did happen, but after that, I don&#039;t think--there wasn&#039;t
really that much of anything like that again. But they do discipline though.
They would sit their kids down and talk. But for us, the family part is that our
relatives are there, and it&#039;s kind of like they have the right to discipline
your children. Because it&#039;s your aunt, your uncle. It&#039;s not spanking them or
anything like that, it&#039;s just sitting them down and talking to them. That&#039;s why
we tell our children too, that if someone comes up to you and corrects you, or
sees you doing something wrong and they lecture you, you just say, &quot;Thank you,&quot;
and it&#039;s up to you to take it and use it. You know how some kids are, &quot;Oh, they
don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about.&quot; But that&#039;s not what we teach our
children, that they have to basically stand there and listen, and either take it
in and learn something from it, because maybe they know that something happened
like that before, or maybe they experienced something like that, and they&#039;re the
ones that are going to tell you what&#039;s going to happen, what might happen.
Anyway, they always talk to the kids though, and discipline them.

CASTLE: By they, you mean the council, or governor?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: The governor, the parents. That&#039;s why I&#039;m saying the community
was very close.

CASTLE: I see.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: They didn&#039;t, like basically--they always looked out for each
other. Even their children, they always looked out for their kids. But the guys,
when they turned sixteen, they had to attend the village meetings. Just like
here, they have to attend the village meetings starting at sixteen.

CASTLE: Just the guys?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Just the guys. Because women at that time were not really,
they didn&#039;t go to meetings. You could basically say at the time they weren&#039;t
allowed to go to meetings, until recently--like how many years now? Because of
women&#039;s rights now. [laughter] They attend the meetings. It&#039;s interesting for
me, because you grew up, like, say, women don&#039;t attend, but if you went to one
of these village meetings, it was kind of funny because the women do really
speak up. Sometimes, it&#039;s like it takes forever sometimes. It just depends on
what it is. Sometimes it seems like nothing really gets done.

CASTLE: What, now?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, sometimes like now at the village meetings, sometimes.
But out there, as far as being out there all these years, the women never really
went to the meetings. They basically stuck to the old--I guess you could say
guidelines or whatever.

CASTLE: Was it like division of--different roles?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, different roles.

CASTLE: How would you describe those roles? What were the expectations of men
and the expectations of women?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Well, actually, they are to share those roles. That was
basically it, because they&#039;re supposed to support each other. Let&#039;s say my
mother wanted to go back to school when she was young and my dad would basically
support her. Instead of telling her, &quot;No, you belong here with the kids,&quot; or
whatever. Or washing dishes, the men helped, they shared their work. It wasn&#039;t
like some tribes that I&#039;ve noticed, where the women do all the work. &quot;Oh, that&#039;s
a woman&#039;s job.&quot; The men here didn&#039;t. The men out there were the same, they
basically shared the responsibility in helping, raising kids.

CASTLE: In terms of public governance though, it was still kind of--what I think
is interesting that&#039;s hard, that&#039;s not often expressed, is that there are
different ways of expressing or sharing power. Maybe not power, but certainly
influence. You&#039;re not saying that just because women weren&#039;t present at the
meetings, it didn&#039;t mean they didn&#039;t have a say in how the village ran.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Right. They basically did, because when the men went home they
talked to--they listened to their wives at the same time. Because they&#039;re
sharing that. And the kids, because that way you have input into what is going
on also. Then the men take it back to the meeting, &quot;Hey, my wife made a very
good point here. Let me think about it.&quot; It&#039;s kind of like that. Then they go
back to the meeting and then they present it and say, &quot;Okay, we have a consensus
on what we&#039;re going to be doing.&quot; It&#039;s kind of like they brought it home and the
women did get to discuss it with their husbands. They share it with their
family, in other words, to get that feedback into what was happening. I don&#039;t
ever remember anybody saying, &quot;Well, that&#039;s your job,&quot; kind of a thing. &quot;Because
you&#039;re a lady, this is what you&#039;re supposed to be doing.&quot; But growing up though,
they do tell you, like to cook, you have to learn how to do certain things. They
don&#039;t actually--they tell you in a way, but it&#039;s basically showing you. They&#039;re
your mentor, they&#039;re your example of kind of like what you&#039;re going to be doing,
growing up, supporting your family.

CASTLE: And it&#039;s part of being a good tribal member, a good tribal person? Just
your role, whether you&#039;re male or female, it&#039;s less about a role being
demeaning, right? It&#039;s just more about you being a good part of a whole?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, basically.

CASTLE: I&#039;m just trying to see if I understand it right.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I&#039;ve never seen, like, at least in our family, or growing up,
my grandparents, like fighting over something or whatever.

CASTLE: The thing I really have to ask is--so you played tackle football in high
school as a girl, and you also--I saw some pictures of you war dancing in men&#039;s
regalia. That isn&#039;t something that a lot of other girls did, did they? How is it
you came to do that? And did you ever meet resistance for that?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No, I thought it was fun. [laughter] Just competing. Because
when I was growing up, I was quiet, I guess, or like I was the good kid on the
block, because like, I remember the girls in the village, when they would say,
&quot;Oh, she&#039;s going to be a nun.&quot; Basically, I just didn&#039;t do anything bad. I guess
growing up, having no brothers--he didn&#039;t put pressure or anything, just
basically I did it. My sister went away to school. She stayed with my uncle, he
wanted her to stay with him because he had one son and they had lost their
daughter who was older than their son, so she went to Grand Canyon and went to
school. From there then she went with my mother&#039;s baby sister to Heymouth {?}
when she got her teaching credential at twenty. She taught at Heymouth High
School. My sister was always kind of away at school. She didn&#039;t actually stay--

CASTLE: She wasn&#039;t in the village with you.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Not all the time, yes, because she was away at school. She
left when I was in the fourth grade. Basically, growing up, helping my dad chop
wood, saw wood, stack wood, and dancing. When she was little too, we already
were dancing. My dad--I guess just because my dad made us our outfits and
whatever we used to hoop dance, war dance. Then basically as I got older, to me,
it was fun. So I just used to--I learned all the male dances. My grandparents,
when we came home, and I&#039;d take my grandpa the drum and he would sing and we&#039;d
dance, and I&#039;d get my grandma up or my sister would, and we&#039;d get in line and
she&#039;d show us how to dance certain dances too, women&#039;s. Actually, we learned
both, but I did more of the male dancing than my sister did. I think it was just
all because I had no brothers.

CASTLE: Do you remember times--do you remember any stories about people--because
you&#039;re out dancing, people can&#039;t always tell if you&#039;re male or female, they
assume you&#039;re male.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No, not when I was young, yes. [laughter] It was funny because
my dad came home with us that time and they had Encinal {?} feast here and my
dad said--

CASTLE: That&#039;s the village feast?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: That&#039;s the village feast. My dad said, &quot;Ok, we&#039;re going to
dance, we&#039;re going to participate and we&#039;re going to dance.&quot; I looked at him and
I said, &quot;Okay.&quot; So for whatever reason, all the rest of the people go to the
kiva to practice to dance, but ever since I could remember when we were little
my grandpa always took us from here to the plaza. [telephone interruption]

CASTLE: We were talking about you came home to dance and you were saying that
some people practiced in the kiva.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: In the kiva, but as long as I can remember, we&#039;ve always
danced here and then they took us out from this house to the plaza. All these
years we still do the same thing. I never asked my mother why, but my grandpa
just kept us here and then took us from here to the plaza. Anyway, one year we
came home, my dad came home, and he said, &quot;Okay, we&#039;re going to dance,&quot; and
brought all our stuff home. We were going to dance war dance, which usually no
one really sees around here, danced too much. Except like in Taos they dance war
dance because of the combination with the Comanches.

Anyway, we danced and my cousins just happened to come from Mesita {?} so they
were standing there. The girls that were also standing by then, I don&#039;t know who
they were, but anyway there was a bunch of girls standing by them and I came
running through because I was late, because they had started out and I was the
last one. I don&#039;t know if I came back or something or what. Anyway, I ran all
the way back and I ran through the--because there was still the little opening
before they closed it, you know when you go out to the plaza. I ran through
there and we danced. Then we came back here. Then my cousin came and she was
laughing, she goes, &quot;Them girls still like you.&quot; I started laughing at her. I
go, &quot;What?&quot; She goes, &quot;Well, they kept saying, &#039;Oh, look at that cute boy, I
wonder where he&#039;s from? Is he from Encinal?&#039;&quot; Then my cousin turned around and
she said, &quot;That&#039;s not a boy, that&#039;s a girl!&quot; [laughter]

Then in California when they started the pow-wows in the Bay Area, we used to go
dancing, my dad would sing and stuff too. He belonged to a drum group earlier,
and then later on they got their own drum group which was called the Mocking
Bird. There was only four men in that drum. I used to dance I&#039;d sign up because
they&#039;d have contests, right? I would sign up, I think when I got to junior high
school, I started to, like, &quot;Okay, I&#039;m wearing a war outfit, I&#039;m going to sign
up.&quot; So I would sign up. Nobody would say anything to me, right? Then I would
dance and then if I won then it&#039;s like, &quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; Then they come up and ask
me, &quot;Who let you dance?&quot; I said, &quot;Apparently you guys. I signed the book, no one
said anything.&quot; See, when they looked at it, it said Ruth. It&#039;s a men&#039;s dance.
It was a war dance, competition, ruffle dance, whatever. Because you wear a
number and you sign your name with that number. I guess that&#039;s probably where
they finally asked, &quot;Who allowed you to dance?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, I signed up.&quot;

CASTLE: &quot;You didn&#039;t say anything until I won.&quot;

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, &quot;You didn&#039;t say anything when I signed up.&quot; &quot;Well, you
can&#039;t dance.&quot; I go, &quot;Why not?&quot; &quot;Well, you should be dancing with the women.&quot;
&quot;Well, women don&#039;t wear war outfits,&quot; I said, &quot;and I wear what these guys are
wearing.&quot; Then they&#039;d have to say, &quot;Well, we&#039;re sorry that this contestant is--&quot;
How did they say it? Not withdrawn. I can&#039;t remember how they used to say it.
Anyway, then I would do it again. Then after that it was like, to heck with
that. I would sign up any time they had a competition, I would sign up.

CASTLE: So did they disqualify you?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, they disqualified me. They would disqualify me, and I
would dance again. I remember dancing, well, several places they had pow-wows
and if they had competitions I would sign up. And I&#039;d win.

CASTLE: And did they disqualify you every time?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: They would disqualify me every time. Then the people that knew
me, some of the people, they&#039;d sit in the audience, &quot;Boo, boo!&quot; [laughter] That
was fun. Then one year at Hayward State--not Hayward State, at Hayward, there
was kind of like, kind of an amphitheater, a small one. It was--what was the
name of that place? Anyway, that was the first year that there was this Sioux
girl that came from the north and she wore just all leather with kind of fur,
anyway, she had a fur hat on, that they wear up north, a men&#039;s hat, and she was
dressed in buckskin. She danced and then my friend from Nevada, we were
laughing. I said, &quot;Hey, why don&#039;t you go dance? Let&#039;s go dance!&quot; So we all
signed up, all of us, us girls. We all signed up and went out there and danced,
competed with the men, and we all won. [laughter] But I swear, that Sioux girl
was good. She looked like a man when she was dancing. She basically just had the
style down.

CASTLE: Was it a traditional dance?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It was a traditional dance. I came in first, she came in
second, and the girl from Nevada came in third. That was something, when they
basically said, &quot;Oh, wait a minute!&quot;

CASTLE: What did they do? Did they disqualify all three of you?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: They couldn&#039;t disqualify us because we won. It was really
interesting. That was the first year that all women won that contest. She was
really good though. The next time we competed with them at Marin. This time it
was a Chippewa girl that danced.

CASTLE: What years was this?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Those were in the late fifties. But she wasn&#039;t really--she
just did it just to do it.

But I knew her. The other two girls, the girl from the north, she must have
danced when she was young, because she was good. The one from Nevada, she kind
of danced on and off, but when she got into her teens, she used to come but she
wouldn&#039;t dance. I danced until I was forty-two, war dance. My last show I did
was with my dad when he came back to Richmond. My nephew was there, and he said,
&quot;Okay, you two,&quot; he said, &quot;I got a contract, this man wants us to dance.&quot; That&#039;s
why he had gone to California. I don&#039;t know where he had met him. Anyway, so we
went to--not Petaluma, it&#039;s past Petaluma. Anyway, we danced, and that was the
last time I danced with my nephew and we did war dance and stuff. My dad likes
to tease us, &quot;You guys can still dance.&quot; [laughter] We tell him, &quot;Yeah.&quot; That
was the last time I danced full dress in men&#039;s outfit, was when I was
forty-three. I still dance though, you know, just at the pow-wow or something.
When my dad was still living we came home, and there&#039;s Taos, there&#039;s like the
patterns and the rhythm stuff, but Taos is really fast. It&#039;s like--Kiawah&#039;s
medium is like slow. Their fast is like--

CASTLE: In the war dance?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: In the war dance, the rhythm, yes. They&#039;re fast. The beat is
just a little bit difference but my dad, he was making fun, and he got the drum
and Ian {?} he was here--let me see, he was twenty-something, and my sister was
here, she had come home too. My dad said, &quot;Do you girls still remember?&quot; My dad
said, &quot;Ah, I bet you can&#039;t dance.&quot; We said, &quot;Yes we can, Dad.&quot; So my sister
said, &quot;Come on, let&#039;s go. Sing, Dad.&quot; He started the drum and she said, &quot;Come on
Ian! See if you can keep up with us.&quot; Her son. My dad started singing. He
couldn&#039;t get started. Just the beat was different.

CASTLE: It was too fast?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It was fast. My dad said, &quot;You girls still can dance, huh?&quot; [laughter]

CASTLE: So this is something you had done all the way from--you started when you
were in the village?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I guess, I don&#039;t know. I know I was dancing in the picture at
six. I must have started dancing whenever, just listening to my dad singing and
watching him dance and stuff like that. Ian started when he wasn&#039;t even one. He
was like, maybe, before nine months, after nine months. We used to laugh because
he&#039;d have to come and change his diaper and then go back out. [laughter]

CASTLE: Go back out and dance.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: But walking-wise, he could dance better than he could walk by
himself. Because he wasn&#039;t even one yet. He would get out there and he would
dance. Ever since then, I used to baby sit him and whenever I went dancing, we
went to pow-wows, he was with us, and basically also dancing when he was young
too. This last pow-wow I went to I was dancing and they did an honor song for
the students, so we were dancing. I guess this old man, he competed in the
traditional dance, and I finally figured it out when he came up after the
contest, he won, right, and when he came to shake our hands--I guess he saw me
dancing. He said, &quot;Hey, you know what? You practice a little bit more,&quot; he said,
&quot;you&#039;re going to be good.&quot; I was laughing, and I said, &quot;You haven&#039;t seen me in
full swing yet.&quot; Because I was just--because the women don&#039;t really dance except
for their fancy show dance and the girls kind of really dance around.

CASTLE: But he had no idea that you were a ground-breaking dancer from a young age.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It was fun though. I just probably, after that I just did it
to see what they would say, or to see if I could actually compete with the guys.
Probably just to see if I could actually do it, because the world champion of
war dancing came one year and they used to call him Woogie, and his name was
George Watch Taker. He was the first place in the world&#039;s competition. I was
only, what? Maybe I was in high school, my last year. They told him that I
danced. I said, &quot;Okay, you guys are coming to--&quot; because they were performing
also, because they were doing their tour.

CASTLE: Was this in Richmond?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It was in San Francisco. We went to San Francisco to the
Indian Center, because that&#039;s where they were. My brother in law&#039;s uncle was the
hoop dancer. His hoop dancings were like eighteen inches. He was a small man
anyway, thin, but he used to dance hoop dance.

CASTLE: People who dance hoop dance, you have to pass the hoops over your body.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, and a good hoop dancer to me--I watch hoop dancers now,
you know how the hoops look big or whatever? Good hoop dancer is an inch off
your shoulder. That&#039;s a good hoop dancer. If you can dance as fast as you
compete in war dance, through those hoops, or just with the one hoop, you&#039;re a
good hoop dancer, because you keep that step and you&#039;re going in and out of that
hoop just as fast as you&#039;re competing in war dancing. Anyway, he was good, and
he was on the tour with him. That night we went and he was joking around, you
know. He said, &quot;You want to dance?&quot; He said, &quot;I&#039;ll bet I could out dance you.&quot; I
said, &quot;You probably could.&quot; And he picked a drum and we danced that night. He
said, &quot;Dang, you&#039;re good.&quot; [laughter] I was laughing at him. My dad was always
proud of me I guess, because no boys, right, only girl that could dance in the
Bay Area. If you came, if my dad was living now, he&#039;d bring out all the
pictures. &quot;This is my daughter, she used to war dance and get first place.&quot;

CASTLE: Right.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Anyway, I thought--it was competition for me at the same time,
because it was like no other girl was dancing during those years. I think I just
kind of enjoyed seeing if I could out dance the guys.

CASTLE: So this is something you did all throughout school and high school?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: All through school, yes.

CASTLE: Obviously up until later in life. You were saying that some of the
traditional--that there was both--tell me about spiritual life, if you will,
because that allows you to talk both about if you went to church, what role that
played, how that plays into the life of someone who is Laguna and how you
brought together those, living in the village.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I guess basically at the same time, the majority of the tribe
is Catholic. I don&#039;t think I would have ever went to catechism if the ladies
didn&#039;t come from Standard Oil, come into the village to teach catechism. I don&#039;t
think I would have ever gone if they didn&#039;t come in. At the same time, it&#039;s
like, do I really remember what they taught me? At the same time, but comparing
it, and I&#039;ve never read the Bible. But comparing stories, they&#039;re similar. I
could change the characters and it would be the same, kind of the same,
especially with the emergence and the Bible when the people left at that time
and they all spoke different languages, you know, in the Bible, when it says
that. I grew up basically, because of my grandparents and my dad, that really
believed in his religion, just hearing them and talking and praying and stuff
like that, that I guess you just deal with both, basically. I mean, I was
baptized Catholic, and then I made my first confirmation, I mean, my holy
communion, then my confirmation. Other than that, and after that, then it&#039;s
like, I probably went to church about twice a year. [laughter]

CASTLE: In order to practice traditional religion in the village, was there
anything built for that? Did you have a kiva? And what purpose does a kiva serve?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: It serves a lot, but basically we had a meeting hall and the
men actually used another part of the duplex housing for their regalia and stuff
like that. Religion is like, everyday, it doesn&#039;t matter. Even the dancing is
religious, and they tell you about the dancing, about what you do, what it&#039;s
for. It&#039;s the whole living style basically, of religion. Everything
is--everything means something.

Furey:

Can you give us an example of spiritual practice in daily life? I know we break
off a little bit of food at the table.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Like for grace, when you say grace at the table. Oh, my sister
is good at it, she basically does it every day. She&#039;ll get her cornmeal and go
outside, before that. I don&#039;t know about now. I do that also. It&#039;s kind of like
when you remember. [laughter] You&#039;re supposed to be doing this. Where I&#039;m at in
Richmond, I do, I come out of my house before the sun comes up and pray. Then
for--because that prayer is for everybody, it&#039;s not just a family, it&#039;s the
whole world, all the people who live in it, for you guys.

But even just--I guess the use of certain plants too, that are part of the
religious thing. But like I said, it&#039;s every day life. I don&#039;t know how many
people go out, like in the morning any more. Yet, even though they don&#039;t, it&#039;s
still part of a lot of things they do inside the home. Of course they still have
their religious dancing, which the men take part in, and the women do a lot of
the cooking and preparing their stuff for them and things like that. It&#039;s just
the whole thing.

CASTLE: So in terms of Catholicism--oh, go ahead.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Then they did that at Richmond. There are certain dances that
they could do there. The boarded up between the houses, they boarded it up when
they were going to have certain dances so people couldn&#039;t see in, in Richmond,
in the colony.

CASTLE: Oh really?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: Let&#039;s stop here and switch tapes.

Begin Audiofile 2

CASTLE: About daily life in Richmond growing up. Specifically, you&#039;ve shared a
lot of stories about how nice people were to you as kids. Maybe you can give
that a framework of how old were you, and what is it you remember when you left
the village, where are the places that you went? I guess we could start with the
typical day question. How you got up, how you walked to school, how you came
home--did you stop and get sweets somewhere? Why were people so nice to you, do
you think?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I know I got up early because school started at 7:30 at Harry
Els. [laughter] It started that early in the morning, so we got up no later than
six, because then we had to get ready and we walked to school.

CASTLE: How far away was school?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Like, I would say, maybe forty-five blocks total. Because
where we walked from, the village, to the yard, past the doctor&#039;s office, up the
stairs, across the Vie Dock, down the Vie Dock, across the street to Atchison
Village. Then from there just walked straight up to Harry Els High School.

CASTLE: Who did you walk with?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Sometimes, actually, most of the time by myself. I was kind of
like in the middle, and the girl younger than me, at the time when I was
starting school, I was the only one in that age group. So they were older than
me, so they were a year ahead of me, like in the tenth and eleventh grade. But
when the girls came from I think Richmond High, sometimes they came on the bus
and got off there too. During the time, the early part of that tenth grade year,
I used to catch a ride with the Sanchez boy across the street. Especially during
the winter, his dad would drop us off at school. Then after that, I would walk
home or catch the bus from high school. I think I got home about 3:30 when
school was out, no later than 4:00. By the time I got home--because my dad got
home at 3:30. By the time I got home, we were ready to eat. Then after that I&#039;d
go and do my homework, or if my dad needed help I&#039;d go help him.

CASTLE: What kind of things did you help your dad with?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Like bringing in the wood, or going to the woodpile,
collecting wood, or if he chops there, stacking it there for him on the cart.
Then walking back and helping him stack it in the wood shed and stuff. But just
all the things--because he even had a garden on the side too. He had his own
small garden on the side too. He&#039;s the one that basically did that stuff. As I
got older, I think, like from eleventh grade to twelfth grade, I still helped,
but I didn&#039;t do as many chores. Then I ended up having to learn to make oven
bread and cook and stuff because my mom, when she went to the hospital or when
she came home, then my dad and I were by ourselves so I ended up--because I used
to help her, but then I ended up learning how to do the whole thing, and make
Easter pudding that everyone was talking about, and tamales.

CASTLE: Are these things you hadn&#039;t done before?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, I really hadn&#039;t done it. I would just watch everybody. I
would watch. Because when we came home they were always making stuff and then I
learned how to make cinnamon roll bread and put it in the oven and stuff like
that. Then sewing, I had a sewing class. Actually I learned how to sew in the
eighth grade, because in seventh grade I took shop. [laughter] I had shop class.

CASTLE: Were there a lot of other girls in shop class?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: A few, there was a few. Anyway, I took shop. I didn&#039;t want to
take home-ec. Then I did in the eighth grade, I took home-ec at Roosevelt Junior
High School. They had us cook whatever things for the event, turkey. We learned
to make pies, pie crust, and learn measurements and stuff like that, when you&#039;re
making stuff. The other half of that, the other half of the year in eighth grade
then, we had sewing, so I learned how to sew. Not that I didn&#039;t know how to sew,
but it was part of the class. I learned how to make clothes with no patterns,
like the--I can&#039;t remember what it was--the facing, inside, so without a
pattern. We learned how to make facing and stuff like that, without a pattern,
make stuff. When I was little though, I think by the time I got to the fourth
grade I was already sewing. Sewing traditional costumes already. My mother
taught me how. So I was already making things that needed to be used for dancing
or sacred dancing, things that other people can&#039;t see. There are certain
stitches you learn, certain things you can&#039;t tie knots in. It&#039;s a special kind
of--those were special. The ones with no knots. I learned that when I was
little. I guess by the time I got to the sixth grade, in between there then I
learned to embroider. I used to embroider. My classmate, he was a white guy, and
he embroidered. He didn&#039;t have a father, he had a mother. She taught him to
embroider I guess. He used to come from Perrys School, after school, or on the
weekend, he&#039;d bring his little bag, and he&#039;d ride his bike, and he&#039;d come and
knock on the door. My mom, she used to laugh at me. She said, &quot;It&#039;s your friend
Norman.&quot; [laughter] And he would come in. We&#039;d sit on the porch and we&#039;d sew,
we&#039;d do embroidery.

CASTLE: What grade were you in?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I think we were like in the fourth--between the fourth and the
sixth grade, because he was my classmate for a couple of years. His mom would
like, I guess, call my mom once in a while, &quot;Is Norman there?&quot; Because she would
miss him. Then the two Spanish boys, Henry Romirez--he was our newspaper boy.
After he found out that us kids lived there, he used to come down and they would
play baseball with us. On the other side of the second row they had a court, Mr.
Sanchez had put in a basketball--he made a basketball ring. He made the whole
thing for us, so we used to go play basketball in the back, and play baseball
back there. I thought it was fun because the guys would come from school and
they would come and like play baseball with us. Norman was the first one that
used to come to the village. Out of all the kids--except Linda when she got
older--during elementary school he was the one that first, out of the village
person that would come in and visit, as far as kids our age. He was my classmate
and he used to come and he would bring his--

CASTLE: Just this young white boy coming to embroider.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes! [laughter] I&#039;m sure he didn&#039;t show his embroidery when he
was coming in. He would pull it out and we would sit there. My mom and his
mother would talk at school.

CASTLE: They were friendly?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes they were friendly, his mom was friendly. It was funny
though. He would come. The first time he came though, you know, it&#039;s like you&#039;re
shy, and it&#039;s like, he&#039;s knocking on the door and he asked for me and my mom
said, &quot;Norman&#039;s here.&quot; Because she met--my mother would go to the PTA meetings
and she would see the kids, or come to our classroom if they ever gave talks. I
would always kind of, I didn&#039;t know him that well at that time. I would always
tell him, because my cousin lived down the row, and her name was Bobby Ann
Sarracino, and said, &quot;Oh, I&#039;m doing something, go see Bobby Ann.&quot; [laughter] I
would send him down the road! Then she&#039;d talk to him and they&#039;d talk. Later
then, after, I guess I was doing something anyway at school--we were probably
doing something and that&#039;s probably where he saw me embroidering but I didn&#039;t
know he embroidered. But then he would come and he&#039;d bring his bag and that&#039;s
when we would sit on the porch and embroider. Then I guess in junior high
school, basically I think we had the first yearbook too, I think we worked on
the first yearbook at Roosevelt Junior High School because we never had a
yearbook. The last year I was meeting there we had a yearbook before I went to
Harry Els High School.

CASTLE: Before we move from that, I was wondering when--here you are, you&#039;re in
this very segregated space, where there&#039;s very positive community feelings but
it&#039;s all Indian. When did you first become aware of race difference or cultural
difference? Was it positive, negative? What are those memories like?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: They weren&#039;t bad though.

CASTLE: Can you locate them to a special, particular incident?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I think it was like in the--by the time I got to the third
grade and we had to have partners and stuff like that. They used to teach us
folk dancing and stuff like that and we had to have partners. I think that&#039;s
when we used to get teased, a lot of us from the village, because they would
say, &quot;Oh, you&#039;re Chinese.&quot; Like, squint their eyes, like that, and we just
looked at them. It didn&#039;t bother us though, I guess, because we used to get teased.

CASTLE: Were these white kids?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Black kids, Mexican kids, all the kids.

CASTLE: Did they know you were Indian? Did they have any concept of that?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No, but when they found out we were Indian it was a whole
different story. [laughter[

CASTLE: In what way?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: In that basically, in a way, it&#039;s like you--it&#039;s not saying
that they were afraid of us kind of, but they kept their distance. They
basically--they were friendly though, after they found out what nationality we were.

CASTLE: Why do you think they kept their distance? What was it?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I think they were afraid of us once they found out who we
were, because you know, TV, cowboys and Indians were still playing at that time.
We used to watch Gene Autry and what&#039;s his name, Gabby Hayes, Hop-along Cassidy.
Those were the ones they used to play together, Dale Evans and Roy Rogers. They
were still cowboys and Indians, I remember, because the kids at school used to
have cap-guns in their belts and stuff like that. I think when I got to junior
high school I didn&#039;t have a problem though because it was all mixed.

CASTLE: It was very diverse?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, it was. So we all got along at school. There was not
really any kind of--except one Spanish girl, she had long hair too, and I always
got called into the office, and my counselor would always say, &quot;What are you in
for?&quot; And I would say, &quot;I don&#039;t know, what am I in here for?&quot; And he would tell
me and I&#039;d go, &quot;That&#039;s not me.&quot; Then I&#039;d have to stay for detention.

CASTLE: They wouldn&#039;t believe that it wasn&#039;t you?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Then the next time something happened--I guess she got in a
fight, and so I got called in and he said, &quot;What were you doing out there? They
reported you.&quot; I said, &quot;Me? Not me.&quot; I go, &quot;I know,&quot; I said, &quot;can I go and come
right back?&quot; He said, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; I said, &quot;I&#039;m going to class, but
I&#039;ll be right back. Can I go? I&#039;ll show you.&quot; So I went to class and I got Ruth
out of class and I took her with me, and I said, &quot;This is the one that was
fighting, and this is the one that I&#039;m always doing detention for.&quot; She just
looked at me and smiled, right?

CASTLE: She&#039;s getting away with it.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, she was getting away with it. Finally he looked at her
and said, &quot;Oh I guess I can see that they would mistake you for her.&quot; Except she
wore glasses, I didn&#039;t. It was funny.

CASTLE: He wasn&#039;t very apologetic?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: That was the first time--actually, twice, I think junior high
was my most exciting year. [laughter]

CASTLE: Why is that?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Because--my mom made me laugh, she goes, &quot;Okay, if anybody
gets you in trouble or you get into trouble, don&#039;t say nothing, just walk out of
that school and come home.&quot; I said, &quot;You&#039;re serious?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes. Just walk
out and come home and I&#039;ll be right at that school.&quot; And the parents were. Even
when their grandchildren, our kids, my sister&#039;s kids and my kids, my kids were
fine, but if anything happened, my dad was right down at the principal&#039;s office,
dean&#039;s office, just in case. We couldn&#039;t make it ourselves, we were working, my
mom and dad would go to the school. At school, I wasn&#039;t doing anything, I was
just sitting my role. This girl was messing around with this guy. She threw the
comb, right? So all I did was pick up the comb and give it back, which I
shouldn&#039;t actually have done. But I got caught with the comb, because I was
passing it, right? He kept saying to be quiet and I was sitting back there. He
was a white teacher and he had an attitude anyway, because a lot of kids didn&#039;t
care for his class. It was a history class. Anyway, he goes, &quot;Sarracino.&quot; We&#039;re
all like, &quot;Oh, shoot, what?&quot; He goes, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; I said, &quot;Nothing, I
didn&#039;t do anything.&quot; &quot;Yes you did, I saw you.&quot; I go, &quot;No you didn&#039;t, you were
facing the blackboard, then you turned around when I was handing the comb
because it fell.&quot; But actually they were messing around. He said, &quot;No, you were
throwing that comb.&quot; I guess he heard the comb dropping. [laughter] &quot;You were
the one that was doing it.&quot; I go, &quot;No I wasn&#039;t.&quot; &quot;Don&#039;t talk back to me!&quot; I
looked at him and I walked out of class. I just remembered what she said, so I
walked out of class. I went straight to my counselor and I sat in his office. He
saw me coming in and I sat right down and he said, &quot;What are you here for?&quot; I
said, &quot;You&#039;ll see in a minute.&quot; Sure enough, here comes my teacher straight down
the hallway. He saw me sitting there and he looked at me. He goes, &quot;Don&#039;t you
walk out of this class.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, I&#039;m sorry, but my mother told me
whatever happens to leave the classroom and go to your counselor and have him
call me and she&#039;d be right here.&quot; My counselor looked at him and he goes, &quot;What
did she do?&quot; He was telling him, I go, &quot;No I didn&#039;t.&quot; See, he already knew I was
getting blamed for stuff anyway, because of the incidents earlier. So he said,
&quot;Well, okay, it&#039;s alright, she can stay here.&quot; So I stayed there and I was
talking to him.

Then I went to English class, right? And right now I don&#039;t remember what
happened in English class, and maybe just from that class or whatever. But
anyway, I went and got blamed for something in that classroom. So I got up,
walked out, went back down to my counselor and sat there. [laughter] I told him,
&quot;Why don&#039;t you just call my mom? I didn&#039;t do anything.&quot; My English teacher, he
wasn&#039;t bad though, he was a pretty good teacher. He called my mom. He goes,
&quot;Well, your mother will be up tomorrow. She has an appointment.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay.&quot;
So the next day I went to school, went to my classes, got to my English class.
My English teacher said, &quot;Oh, I met someone today.&quot; I go, &quot;Yeah, my mom, huh?&quot;
He goes, &quot;Yes. I don&#039;t know why, but I thought your mother was English.&quot; I
looked at my English teacher and I go, &quot;Do I look white?&quot; He goes, &quot;Well, no.&quot;
He said, &quot;But your mother writes so well.&quot; I go, &quot;Because my mother writes
well,&quot; because they had an accent kind of at the time. He goes, &quot;So that doesn&#039;t
make like she has an education or what.&quot; I was telling him. &quot;No, no, no.&quot; I
guess he didn&#039;t mean to say it that way, you know. But I guess just because
that&#039;s what happened.

CASTLE: That&#039;s what happened.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, I go, &quot;Dang, just because my mother writes well he
thought she was English.&quot; [laughter] I was laughing, I told my mom when I got
home and she was laughing. I said, &quot;That&#039;s kind of weird.&quot; That&#039;s why I told
him, &quot;Do I look English?&quot;

CASTLE: And you called him on it, too.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes I called him on it, too.

CASTLE: Did he act with some embarrassment?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes he did. Especially when he saw my mother walking in to
see. She goes, &quot;Yeah, I wondered why he was kind of--your teacher is nice
though.&quot; I think he was just surprised to see her because she wasn&#039;t English,
when he talked to her over the phone I guess. Because he said, &quot;I met your
mother but I thought she was English.&quot; Because she writes very well. I guess--I
don&#039;t know what she did or what, but--and I can&#039;t remember if she sent a note
back with me really. Anyway, he saw her writing. I don&#039;t know if he had her fill
out anything either, or ask her to do whatever. He said her penmanship was
really beautiful. I was laughing and I said, &quot;And then?&quot; He goes, &quot;Oh well, we
talked about it.&quot; I said, &quot;And then?&quot; He goes, &quot;Well, I guess you don&#039;t have to
stay for detention.&quot; I said, &quot;Well I shouldn&#039;t have to because I didn&#039;t do
anything to begin with.&quot; I guess that was just my bad year in the eighth grade.

CASTLE: Misbehaving? [laughter]

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Misbehaving and it wasn&#039;t even me. Then like--the same girl, I
went to the gym, right? I went to the gym, two black girls came out, and the two
white girls that I was friends with that had the Cadillac, we went to school at
junior high school too. I come out of the locker and I saw them, I saw them
talking. I was carrying my books and they came out. They came out, right, and
they walked in front of me and they talked smart and stuff. I was standing there
and I go, &quot;I didn&#039;t do anything, what are you talking about?&quot; &quot;Well, you did
such and such to my friend.&quot; I go, &quot;That wasn&#039;t me.&quot; And they go, &quot;Yes it was.&quot;
So I said, &quot;Okay, all right, what are you going to do?&quot; They pushed me, right?
So I put my books on the fountain, right? And the two white girls came and they
said, &quot;Don&#039;t touch her.&quot; They looked at them, and they were already black and
white already. They go, &quot;You know what? If I were you I would not mess with her.
She&#039;s not Mexican, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re thinking.&quot;

They told them, the two. They looked, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; And she
goes, &quot;No, she&#039;s not Mexican.&quot; Then they got smart and said, &quot;Well, what are
you?&quot; I said, &quot;I&#039;m Native American, I&#039;m American Indian. And I didn&#039;t do
nothing. But you want to go to it? Let&#039;s go.&quot; They just looked at me like, &quot;Oh
no, okay.&quot; Because the two girls were standing there and they were saying,
&quot;Well, we don&#039;t have to do anything, but we will back her up.&quot; It was funny
because they were my two friends and they were white. [laughter] Because there
was already that kind of thing already, but basically everybody got along fine,
it&#039;s just that when somebody messed with something. But see, I always got blamed
for something. I was never there, it was the girl that wore the glasses.
[laughter] It was funny. That was my worst year at school in the eighth grade.

CASTLE: So those two girls were threatening basically, they&#039;re pulling out the,
&quot;You don&#039;t know who you&#039;re messing with,&quot; and build up the fact that you&#039;re
Indian, and being Indian means that, you know, you&#039;re a threat?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, because North Richmond is considered bad at that time.
Parchester Village, you know? At that time, in Richmond. It was so funny though
because some of the kids that went to school with us, I don&#039;t know, somebody
must have had something with one of the Indian kids or one of the adults. All
that I remember saying, when we were in school too, &quot;Don&#039;t mess with them,
they&#039;re Indian.&quot; It&#039;s almost like someone saying, &quot;No, you just don&#039;t mess with
them, they&#039;re crazy.&quot; [laughter] They don&#039;t care, they&#039;ll beat you up. They just
never bothered us.

CASTLE: So there was an advantage to the stereotype.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, I guess so, at that time, sometimes it was.

CASTLE: It&#039;s still dehumanizing to a certain degree.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Right.

CASTLE: Because it&#039;s like--did anyone ever say anything like, &quot;Oh, they&#039;ll scalp you.&quot;?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Junior high school, same year, it&#039;s like, &quot;Oh, you&#039;re Indian.
Is your daddy a chief? Do you live in a teepee?&quot; And when I got to Berkeley, I
couldn&#039;t believe it in the dorm, they were--the kids would tell me, the
students, when they&#039;d come in, &quot;I don&#039;t believe this, the guy asked me if my dad
was a chief.&quot;

CASTLE: A university student?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: A university student! I go, &quot;Dang! You guys are still going
through this.&quot; And my kids went through it too. They went through the same thing
at elementary school at Point Richmond. They thought that they were a different
nationality. My son made me laugh. He said, &quot;Mom!&quot; I go, &quot;What?&quot; He goes, &quot;These
two kids were bothering me.&quot; I go, &quot;For what?&quot; He said, &quot;Because,&quot; I didn&#039;t like
it, he goes, &quot;But I didn&#039;t do anything.&quot; I said, &quot;What did he say to you?&quot; He
goes, &quot;Well, that black kid was telling me that I&#039;m Chinese and I told him, &#039;No,
I&#039;m American Indian.&#039;&quot; He kept pushing his eyes back and saying, &quot;Ching ching
ching,&quot; songs like that to him. I said, &quot;Well, what did the white kid do?&quot; He
said, &quot;He was doing the same thing.&quot; I said, &quot;Oka7, when you go back to school
tomorrow, if they do the same thing to you, you say, &#039;So what? I&#039;m American
Indian, at least I know what tribe I am and where I come from. What kind of
white are you? Or what kind of black are you? Do you know your heritage? Do you
know where you come from? Because we&#039;re all supposed to get along, it doesn&#039;t
matter what color you are.&#039;&quot; Anyway, my son said, &quot;I told them.&quot; I go, &quot;What&#039;d
they do?&quot; He goes, &quot;They didn&#039;t do anything, they just looked at me.&quot; [laughter]
Kind of a thing.

Basically, I was laughing, I said, &quot;I shouldn&#039;t have told him that.&quot; But
basically, I said, &quot;They do come from somewhere, they have a heritage. They&#039;re
all different races whether they&#039;re white, they&#039;re Swedish, Irish, whatever,&quot; I
said, &quot;they come from somewhere. And so do the black kids. Just that for them
they were brought here,&quot; I said, &quot;by other people. But they may have lost some
of their heritage and they may not know exactly what tribe or which section of
African they originated from, or from wherever, but they do have that heritage.&quot;
I told him. &quot;So people are different, so you just have to get along. And just
ask them, too, if you&#039;re not sure. Where do you come from? Do you speak a
different language?&quot;

It&#039;s interesting though because my mom and them, when I grew up, my mom and them
spoke Indian to us all the time, even in Richmond. And the neighbors, they
always talked together. But whatever reason, we don&#039;t speak fluent--or I
don&#039;t--I speak enough to get me by, but I can understand the language. I can
tell you what they&#039;re talking about. I don&#039;t know. My dad never pushed it. He
just said, &quot;Education is important.&quot; I think also with the fact that they
couldn&#039;t speak English when they were going to school, they didn&#039;t want their
children to basically go through that kind of thing at the same time. But they
also told us, &quot;You need to learn, because that&#039;s what you&#039;re going to use so you
can understand other people. Learn from it, and then use it.&quot;

CASTLE: Right, it&#039;s an important tool.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: The thing is, what&#039;s pretty amazing is that your parents continued to
speak their language even though most of the forces in their life tried to beat
it out of them, psychologically and physically.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, really.

CASTLE: If you manage to continue to speak it without a lot of damage--because I
know a lot of people who won&#039;t speak the language even if they know it.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, that&#039;s true, some of them don&#039;t.

CASTLE: In other tribes and such. But it&#039;s still going to affect you. Then, you
know, they&#039;re people with jobs, just trying to raise kids, we always wonder,
&quot;Why aren&#039;t you passing on the language?&quot; Well, think of how hard it is to kind
of maintain a completely bi-lingual house, so that you will make sure that
you&#039;re fluent both in English and in {?}

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Some of the girls married other tribes, so it&#039;s like they
can&#039;t speak their language either. Same with me. But my husband, when we got
married, he had to attend meetings, because we lived in the village, because he
worked for the railroad. He would come home and say, &quot;Why are we going to the
meeting? I can&#039;t understand a word.&quot; Because they speak their language in the
meeting, they still carried that culture and that language with them, and it
still stayed there. My husband would come home and say, &quot;Why am I going to the
meeting? I don&#039;t understand one word they&#039;re saying.&quot; I said, &quot;That&#039;s why they
have an interpreter. You&#039;re supposed to ask him, &#039;Excuse me, what did you just
talk about?&#039;&quot; I said, &quot;You can do that if you want to.&quot;

What happened was that when they came back to the house my dad would explain to
him what they were talking about, you know, in English. When he would come to
the house out of courtesy, my parents won&#039;t speak their language, they&#039;ll talk
English to him. If I go over myself they&#039;ll talk Indian. They talk Indian to the
kids, so they just know a little bit here and there. It is true, it is up to the
parents to teach their kids. They can dance though, they know how to dance our
dancing and they learned their father&#039;s dancing. They know, like, I think a
couple words in his language.

CASTLE: When you&#039;re back in the--I&#039;m just thinking about village life and
Richmond and some of the things you just mentioned--you weren&#039;t really around to
observe at that age, how Richmond transitioned from World War II boom back. How
this massive influx of people during World War II--you&#039;re there, from your
experience, is there anything you can kind of remember about how Richmond
settled in after the war and the impact of the industries ending or scaling
back, and maybe how that affected your family in particular?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: School wasn&#039;t bad, but going to town wasn&#039;t really bad--I
think my dad made a lot of friends with the people that worked in the stores,
when they did shopping. But they didn&#039;t--at that time they were called colored
people. They had a curfew, even when we were young.

CASTLE: Who&#039;s that?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: What they called black people, colored people, at that time,
that was the term that was used when I was growing up. They were called colored
people, not blacks. Black, the term, came in later but it was basically colored
people. Then my mother would tell us too, you know, that&#039;s because, having to do
with segregation. I think she told me it was Eisenhower, or was it Truman at
that time? When they--she said, after that she said, &quot;Now you see them a lot
more on the street, and after a certain hour.&quot; Stuff like that, and restaurants
were--when we used to go to the restaurants too there weren&#039;t any in the
restaurants when we were little. And like in the soda shop we used to go to,
there were basically just white people.

Then we used to go to this one on--

CASTLE: But you never had a problem? It&#039;s interesting, because it really is
about black identity or colored identity. Obviously you&#039;re a dark-skinner
person, but you were never mistaken for someone who was colored.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No. Basically just Mexicans. Everybody thought we were
Mexicans. [laughter] We all got a long.

CASTLE: What about neighborhoods?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: We used to have to walk from elementary school. So at that
time it was--I guess the white people had moved out and the black people had
bought homes on Pennsylvania Avenue. They were fine, they were friendly. I think
it kind of depended on where they came from, like from the south, what state
they came from. There seemed to be a difference in where they came from. Their
attitudes and how they treated people. A lot of them during that time were very
friendly. There was a lady that lived on Fourth Street, my mom, when we&#039;d come
from the store--I don&#039;t know how she met her--but we used to stop and they would
exchange--she would give my mother a plant and the next time we would go by my
mother might give her a plant to exchange plants and stuff. She was a nice lady.

Then coming from Perrys School on A Street--B Street, a little ways down there
was--what was that store called? We just called it the Colored Store because
colored people owned it. So when we went from the village that was the closest
little store to where we lived besides Second Street, which was owned by
Portuguese people. Then Fourth Street, by MacDonald, was the grocery and the
meat counter and stuff like that. Second Street had a meat counter also. But
like when the guys would ride their bikes, if their mother sent them just to get
something, a specific thing, they would just ride to the colored store. It
actually had a name, but I can&#039;t remember right now.

Anyway, we just called it the Colored Store because it was owned by black
people, and that&#039;s where they would go just to pick up something if they needed
one item or something. The guys would ride their bikes to the store right there.
I know we shopped at the Second Street little market and Fourth Street market at
that time.

CASTLE: So was Richmond divided up? Do you remember other neighborhoods going
into--were there kind of white, ethnic neighborhoods? Did people live together
around their ethnic identity or culture?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Kind of, because there was North Richmond, there was
Parchester and they were all black. This side of Point Richmond was all white.
The hills were all white. It&#039;s kind of like, towards out end a little bit, from
Pennsylvania, the last houses were Spanish. And a house over here was Spanish.

CASTLE: So Spanish speaking?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Spanish speaking.

CASTLE: Was it Hispanic people or Mexican?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Probably Mexican.

CASTLE: This is where we&#039;re using some contemporary racial language to describe
it then.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Right. At that time, well, all we knew was basically Spanish
people were Hispanic at that time. Because we came from here, so they always
used the term Hispanic people.

CASTLE: That&#039;s what you used to describe?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Or Spanish people. Mexican, to me, wasn&#039;t really used that
much. The term Hispanic, basically, I think more than anything. Because they
spoke like the people here. [laughter]

CASTLE: Right.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I mean, they had their own--kind of like sections. It just
depended. As you walked, you kind of saw the difference. Living in the village,
it&#039;s all Indian, right? So when we walked to the store, you just kind of notice
where people live and what group of people were there. But they were, they had
their own little sections where they lived. As far as I know they actually got
along, basically. Went walking downtown and whatever. They seemed to be okay.
Let&#039;s say, on this side of Richmond, everything was fine. Maybe not on this side
of Richmond, it was just a little bit bad.

CASTLE: Now is bad a reference to crime?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: Or concern? Was it actual crime or was it more concern over crime?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: A little bit.

CASTLE: Because there&#039;s often paranoia attached to this.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes. For us it wasn&#039;t because we didn&#039;t care. I mean, it was
like, &quot;You&#039;re people,&quot; so we didn&#039;t have any issues as far as race. But I guess
the people that lived kind of near each other, and like a lot of people were
afraid of North Richmond. But it didn&#039;t seem to bother any of us really, I don&#039;t
think. At least during the time I was growing up, it was already basically
everyone was getting along except for a few things. But it was interesting, too,
because you had Oakland, then you had North Richmond. They didn&#039;t get along,
from East Oakland, they didn&#039;t get along with each other for some reason.

CASTLE: You mean the black communities?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: The black communities. By the time I was going into high school.

CASTLE: How did that manifest itself? How was that something you observed?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I guess just because the kids in school, you know when they
talk about it, and then you see them not getting along or whatever. They talk
about it at school.

CASTLE: Okay. [to Brendan Furey] Did you start to ask something?

Furey:

In some of the oral histories we&#039;ve collected until now, people have painted
this narrative that everything was--in terms of racial relations--rosy during
World War II, and then by the sixties with the civil rights movement and race
riots that things changed, and race became an issue.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I guess it did.

Furey:

Would you agree with that?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: A little bit, because you had the Black Panthers and the
Hell&#039;s Angels and they were all in Richmond. [laughter] Yes, I guess you could
say you could see people--but I guess in a way--I knew they were there and I
knew Hell&#039;s Angels were there.

CASTLE: You were twenty in 1968 when the Panthers were two years into their organization.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Right.

CASTLE: And like you said, they were in Richmond.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: They were in Richmond. Actually, even before they became well
known, they were already kind of a little group already.

CASTLE: They were known to you in Richmond?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: For what? What kind of things were they doing that were noticeable?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I guess because they were out there.

CASTLE: On the streets, you mean?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Kind of. I guess it&#039;s something normally that other blacks
wouldn&#039;t do, kind of thing. It&#039;s like Hell&#039;s Angels, you didn&#039;t know who Hell&#039;s
Angels were then either, until you kind of hear about them in school, or what
they&#039;ve done from the newspaper or whatever. I do know that they were there
though, just like on Cutting Boulevard and on Twenty-third and where Hell&#039;s
Angels used to have their little club thing.

CASTLE: Where was that? On Twenty-third and Cutting?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No, on Twenty-third and--passed {?} and there was another
group before the Panthers. They used to be on Cutting Avenue, what were they
called? They had--oh, shoot, what were they called? Because there was a fish
market on that site also, on Cutting.

CASTLE: Another group like a race-based group?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes. They were blacks, but they had a--they used to wear their
jackets. Oh shoot, what were they called? This was when I was in high school.

CASTLE: They had jackets?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: They had jackets.

CASTLE: That had some kind of logo on them?

Furey:

Could it have been NAACP members?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No.

CASTLE: The Muslims?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: No.

CASTLE: Because that&#039;s the time when you would have gotten the Nation of Islam
also, more prominent, but other than the Black Panthers, that&#039;s a hard one.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I don&#039;t know--

CASTLE: The Black Liberation Army didn&#039;t wear jackets, they were underground.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, but this group had jackets and they used to be right in
that section on Cutting, on lower Cutting, because there was a fish market
there. I don&#039;t know if that was--I guess basically where they actually hung out
and whatever. They had their--I don&#039;t know if it was the clubhouse or whatever.
They were there at that time. I guess it was--well, let&#039;s see.

Who else was there?

Furey:

In the sixties there were a couple of small race incidents on MacDonald. A
couple of businesses were--

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes, they broke their windows and stuff.

Furey:

Do you remember that?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I just remember the windows being broken, but I don&#039;t remember
what year actually it was. Because when we were growing up, by the time I came
of age, I think, junior high school--because they used to cruise down MacDonald
Avenue, the white kids used to cruise. Then pretty soon, as we got into high
school, then it was a mixture of kids. There was a mixture of blacks and
Chicanos and white kids that used to cruise MacDonald. Because I remember when
we used to go shopping and we&#039;d be in town and all of a sudden at a certain time
there would be cruising up and down MacDonald Avenue. There was no low-riding at
that time, just driving back and forth.

Furey:

Then after the incident, the race incident, the police became more of a presence?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes. [laughter] Even now, you see all their little police
stations here and there.

CASTLE: Sub-stations?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Sub-stations, yes.

CASTLE: You were talking about high school and the increased races that would
cruise the boulevard. When were you allowed to--when did you start dating?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Actually I never dated.

CASTLE: Okay.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: I was just like one of the gang, kind of thing. It&#039;s like,
when my sister--before--let&#039;s see, when did she come back? She left when I was
in the fourth grade. She would come home during the summer, or like when my
mom--we went after her to bring her back to visit. The kids in the village, it
was funny, they did, like, in a way, say like, &quot;Who&#039;s going?&quot; And if we were
going, it was okay, they could go. Because my cousins would come and say, &quot;Let&#039;s
go.&quot; &quot;I don&#039;t want to go.&quot; &quot;No come on, let&#039;s go!&quot; &quot;I don&#039;t want to go.&quot; &quot;Well,
I can&#039;t go if you don&#039;t go.&quot; &quot;Why can&#039;t you go?&quot; &quot;Because my parents said if you
guys aren&#039;t going, I can&#039;t go.&quot; I think that&#039;s why they used to tease me,
because it&#039;s like, &quot;You&#039;re the goody two-shoes, you&#039;re the good girl,&quot; kind of
thing. Because the boys across the street, they used to tell my sister that,
too. They&#039;d come and, &quot;Let&#039;s go!&quot; She goes, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because. I can&#039;t have the
car unless you&#039;re going.&quot; Same way with the Acoma guy down the street. He&#039;d say,
&quot;Let&#039;s go to the movies.&quot; One time--I thought we were going to the movies,
right, I said, &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; &quot;Come on, Belle, let&#039;s go to the movies.&quot; I was
laughing after it clicked, right. I said, &quot;You want to go to the dance, right?&quot;
I said, &quot;Okay, if you&#039;re going to go to the dance, just don&#039;t leave me, okay?&quot;
Because I remember he had a girlfriend that lived in--he&#039;s still married to
her--no, he&#039;s not. [laughter] He&#039;s not married to her. Anyway, we would go, we&#039;d
pick up his girlfriend and then we&#039;d go to the dance. Same way with my cousin.
He&#039;d go, &quot;Let&#039;s go to the movies.&quot; I was laughing. I&#039;d go, &quot;What movies?&quot; I&#039;d
go, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; I&#039;d go, &quot;Why do you want to go to the movies?&quot;
&quot;Because.&quot; He did the same thing. We went to go pick up his girlfriend, you
know? I was laughing because then they would come and say, &quot;Let&#039;s go to the
movies.&quot; &quot;No, you want to go to the dance, I don&#039;t want to go.&quot; &quot;Come on, let&#039;s
go!&quot; He goes, &quot;We&#039;re going to the dance.&quot; I go, &quot;Nah, I don&#039;t want to go.&quot; He
goes, &quot;I can&#039;t have the car unless you go.&quot; [laughter] I guess the parents
trusted us. The parents in the village, I guess they trusted us.

CASTLE: You and your sister?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Me and my sister.

CASTLE: Does that have to do with your dad&#039;s and mom&#039;s status too, do you think?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Probably. Because they knew my dad was--

CASTLE: It&#039;s tough when your dad&#039;s like the--there&#039;s some good parts when you&#039;re
dad&#039;s like, he&#039;s an authority figure in the village. But it sounds like, you
know--it&#039;s not like you had to dislike your position as the official chaperone
on everyone else&#039;s dates.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: [laughter] No, it was fun. We didn&#039;t care, we got to go. It
was just funny because they couldn&#039;t go unless we went. My cousins couldn&#039;t go
unless we were going. They couldn&#039;t get the car unless we went. That was the
funny part about it, that we should just go, but I can&#039;t. Or they told them that
we were going with them. Then, we would go--like, they wanted to go to San
Francisco, right? The girls, some of the girls. They would ask me to go, but I
knew them and I grew up with them, but I didn&#039;t really hang out with them. I
mean, we were friendly with each other, but they were--some of them were real
close friends and I was the only one in my age group. I just--you know, well, &quot;I
don&#039;t feel like going.&quot; But anyway, they would ask me to come. They&#039;d say, &quot;Come
on.&quot; I&#039;d say, &quot;Okay, let&#039;s go.&quot; I was the only one being quiet, but at the same
time I was the only one kind of outspoken. So I&#039;d have to ask the bus driver how
to get to San Francisco. I was like the one that was talking for them.

CASTLE: You were in charge all the time?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes.

CASTLE: Had the burden of getting there and organizing.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: [laughter] And getting home, because they didn&#039;t want to ask.
Yet, they wanted to go where they wanted to go, but I don&#039;t know if they were
afraid or they just didn&#039;t--whatever. But every time I went with them I was the
one that always had to ask how to get there and what bus to change to and stuff
like that. It was interesting though, after you think back about it. We used to
go to the dance though. We&#039;d all go. My cousins--I was the youngest one in their group.

CASTLE: These were outside the village? These were dances.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: These were outside the village, because they had the Indian
Center, but the Friendship House that was located where Laney&#039;s at--where
Laney&#039;s at right now. That used to be called the Exposition Building on one
side, the left side of Laney, by the auditorium, the one they call Kaiser
Auditorium now. On Friday nights they had dances there, after--maybe by 1964.
But San Francisco had dances every Saturday night, but they had live bands. They
were all live bands at that time.

CASTLE: The San Francisco Indian Center?

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Mm-hmm, on Sixteenth and Mission. We used to go. I was the
youngest one out of the group. I, of course, my sister, she&#039;ll tell you, &quot;Oh, I
can&#039;t go unless I take my little sister,&quot; right? Which was true of my dad.
[laughter] My dad would say, &quot;Take her,&quot; so I would hang out with the kids who
were older than me because my sister is three years older than me. So our
cousins, our cousins were as old as my sister or a year older. I was the little
kid that hung around with them.

CASTLE: So you were sixteen and they were nineteen.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes. I was actually twelve when they were--if they were
seventeen I was like fifteen, and they would go sometimes when they were
sixteen, so I was thirteen. I actually started going when I was like ten years
old. So, we would go.

One day, well, I was in high school at this time, the eleventh grade. My sister
likes to tell this story, she goes, &quot;Yeah, I had to take her but,&quot; I kept
telling my dad, &quot;but she&#039;s got a toothache.&quot; My dad said, &quot;How do you feel?&quot;
&quot;Oh, I feel all right.&quot; But my jaw was swollen. My tooth went and got--it
swelled. I was going to the dentist on Monday, right? But it was swollen. She
said, &quot;She can&#039;t go.&quot; My dad said, &quot;No, take her. If you&#039;re going to go, take
her.&quot; So we went. Our cousins, there was like Mary, Alice, my sister, Mike,
Gabriel, and me. We all went, right? We got there, I was just sitting there, I&#039;d
just sit around when they&#039;d go. I&#039;d get to--because they know me, because
they&#039;re from the village. They&#039;ll ask me to dance, so I would dance. It was
funny because we go and that night I had my toothache, kind of swollen. They
were laughing and go, &quot;Look at that little girl. She&#039;s out there dancing just
about every dance,&quot; and they were sitting on the thing, and they didn&#039;t get
asked as often. They were laughing at me because I was the one that had the swollen--

CASTLE: The swollen jaw and you were like ten.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Yes. I think I was like--I think I was fifteen at that time
that I went. I remember, I never told my mom though, when we drove the couple
home. He was a bouncer, so he used to, on Saturday nights he was the bouncer at
the dance hall, right? He had a girl, we were the same age just about. I think
she was so many months younger than me. He would call and she&#039;d go, &quot;Well, call
Belle and see if she wants to go.&quot; She would go, &quot;Will you go with me?&quot; Because
she was the only girl and her brother was older. He was older than my sister.

They go to the dance. What I was there for was to babysit and hang around,
because we were about the same age. We&#039;d go and sit in the--there was a--what do
you call it? Like a little canteen, in the dancehall, and they had pool tables
on this side. There was a hat-check girl where you check in your stuff. We
went--he would always take us to the little café, the little thing at the
counter where people order stuff. We&#039;d sit in there and we&#039;d listen to the
music. Or sometimes we&#039;d walk in and watch people dance and then we&#039;d go back to
that little café right there in that building. We&#039;d sit there and we&#039;d have
soda and he&#039;d come in and check on us and then he&#039;d buy us hotdogs or something
and we&#039;d sit there. We&#039;d get up again and we&#039;d go watch people dance and go to
the pool hall, just because it was in that row. And her dad was the bouncer.

One night we went and I guess they went to the bar downstairs on Sixteenth and
Mission. After the dance we didn&#039;t see them, so we said, &quot;Where did they go?&quot; We
were waiting for him to tell us, &quot;Let&#039;s go.&quot; They said, &quot;What are we going to
do?&quot; I said, &quot;I don&#039;t know. Let&#039;s go down and see if they went to the car.&quot;
Here, they were in the car. I guess they had been drinking. We looked at each
other and we go, &quot;How are we going to get home?&quot; [laughter]

So we had a--she got this bright idea because her dad taught her to drive too.
Every time I came home here, my uncle, her brother, he&#039;d let me drive any car.
He would just stick the--put something behind me, and, &quot;Okay, let&#039;s go.&quot; So
actually I learned how to drive a stick when I was young, in a car. And as I got
older, when he had cars I got to drive his cars. He would let me. Or when we
went to the store, he said, &quot;Okay, drive.&quot;

CASTLE: So you knew how.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: So I knew how to drive. But we were short. [laughter] But her
stick--I learned on a stick like this. She said, &quot;It&#039;s the same, it&#039;s the same.&quot;
But their station wagon had the H here, right? I said, &quot;I&#039;ve never shifted on
one of these, just the floor.&quot; I said, &quot;You know how to drive--you drive!&quot; She
goes, &quot;I&#039;m too young.&quot; She&#039;s only like how many months younger than me, right?
We&#039;re sitting there, looking around, and said, &quot;Aw, shoot.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, I&#039;ll
drive, you shift.&quot; So we came across the Bay Bridge. [laughter] &quot;Read? Okay!&quot;
And then she&#039;d shift and then I&#039;d let up on the clutch. We brought them home to
San Pablo Avenue. We left them in the car. We just went in the house and went to
bed and then in the morning--I don&#039;t know how they woke up but they came in the
house, and they were asking each other, &quot;How did we get home?&quot; Because they were
all in the back seat, and they were asking, &quot;Did you drive?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;You drive?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot; Because he was telling us when he walked in, because we were up by then,
we were having cereal. He just stood at the door, since nobody drove them home,
right? He stood at the door in the kitchen saying, &quot;Uh, how did we get home?&quot; We
were sitting there, like, &quot;I don&#039;t know.&quot; He said, &quot;What did you guys do?&quot; We
stood there for a second. &quot;Well, uncle, I drove, she shifted, I stepped on the
clutch and she shifted and we brought you home across the bridge.&quot; He looked at
us and he goes, &quot;You two, don&#039;t you ever do that again.&quot; We told him, &quot;Well,
don&#039;t ever do that to us either.&quot;

CASTLE: Yes.

SARRACINO-HOPPER: Because we were young then when we came across that bridge.

CASTLE: This tape is ending.
