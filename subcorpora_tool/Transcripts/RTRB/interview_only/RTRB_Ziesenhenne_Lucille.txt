RIGELHAUPT: Okay, so we&#039;re here doing an oral history today, and if I could just
get you to start with your full name and your date of birth.

ZIESENHENNE: My name is Lucille Clara ZIESENHENNE: . My maiden name was Floring.
F-L-O-R-I-N-G. I married a German with a strange name. I first met him through
the mail at the office where I worked and I said the manager, &quot;This is a very
strange name.&quot; I just met him by chance and look at this; I married him all of
that. I was born October 24, 1924.

RIGELHAUPT: I think you said that you are not from Richmond. Could you talk a
little bit about where you grew up?

ZIESENHENNE: I was born in a small town about eighteen miles west of Chicago,
Illinois, and that was the home town of my mother, and actually my father too.
He and his family had moved to this very nice, small town, lots of trees, little
quiet streets and that sort of thing, where a lot of the business people from
Chicago liked to live there. I happened to be born there and lived there until I
was eleven. In 1936, January, following of course the Great Depression, which
hit in 1929 primarily, which I don&#039;t remember because I was five, my father lost
his contracting business. He built brick homes and had people working for him.
Brick masonry is very popular back there to keep the homes cool in the summer
and warm in the winter. People could not pay him, and he could not pay his men,
and then he had to sell his equipment and trucks, and finally our home. There
were no social agencies to look after you or help you, if you didn&#039;t have
savings. It was pretty desperate situation. That brought us to California. Is
that what you asked me? Oh, where I grew up. So, I was eleven when I came here.
I got off the train with my mother and sister here in Richmond. My Father had
come earlier. It was an interesting story. He always looked at the want ads, and
of course there was no building, nobody had money for building. He answered an
ad in the Chicago Tribune, he would tell the story. An older man wanted someone
to drive him to Los Angeles, because he was afraid of travel in any other way.
Dad got the job, and so got a free trip to Los Angeles. From there he hitchhiked
to Richmond, where a boy he&#039;d gone to school with had moved, and he was going to
look him up to see if he could help him find work. He did and that all worked
out. So, after some months, he sent for mother, my sister and me. I grew up the
rest of my life right here in Richmond. I haven&#039;t moved around.

RIGELHAUPT: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your parents
and where they were born.

ZIESENHENNE: Yes, I&#039;m sorry I didn&#039;t really look it up to be positive, but I
think I have it all right. Mother and Dad were both born in America. Both of
their parents on both sides were born in Germany, and came over on sailing ships
mother used to say. Sometimes they would be blown backward and forward and so
on. My grandparents all came as sort of young people, because on my paternal
side, they married soon after they arrived here with their parents. On my mom&#039;s
side, they came separately and met when my grandfather found farm work in a
little town in Illinois. I don&#039;t know what my grandmother did, but I think they
met at church. So, that was the beginning of our family. What else did you ask
me about my parents?

RIGELHAUPT: Where they were born?

ZIESENHENNE: Yeah, as I recall, my father&#039;s parents, the ones who had married,
because they met on the ship, married and moved to Wisconsin, and I believe dad
was born there. I do have it in writing. I&#039;ve made up a family tree. Then they
moved to Chicago and from Chicago to this little town of Hinsdale. My mother was
born in Hinsdale, where I was born. Her parents had farmed, and as farmers tried
to do in those days, and still do, because a number of my relatives are still
farming in the Midwest. They farm and then they retire to the city as they say.
Mother&#039;s parents retired to this little town of Hinsdale, which wasn&#039;t too far,
maybe, fifteen, twenty miles from where their farm had been. My mother was the
youngest of five children, twenty years younger than the oldest child, so
there&#039;s all that time. So, her mother was almost like a grandmother to her. She
didn&#039;t know farm life, because she was born in this little town where they
retired, and where my sister and I were born later. We have many roots in this
small town.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you talk about what a typical day was like for you parents was
like, when you were living in Illinois?

ZIESENHENNE: I don&#039;t remember dad&#039;s work at all, except I have a fuzzy memory of
having a very nice car. I must have been like five or so --a big car. So, that
must have been when he had a business, and we had our own home. It was a nice,
typical Midwestern home, with a big yard, and hedges. Everybody had hedges in
the fences. Dad was a very clever workman with his hands; he could do most
anything. He was very good in carpentry, although he had served four years
apprenticeship for brick masonry, as a young man. So, he built lots of nice
thing for us. My sister and I had a wonderful playhouse that he had built in the
backyard, and a swing, a huge swing the people could sit in, and go back and
forth, like a bench here and a bench here, and a big swing that would swing up
and back, I can remember. All homes had full basements. You know that if you&#039;re
from Michigan and full attics. So, when it snowed or the weather was bad, we
could play up in the attic where we had dress up clothes and our own little
section, and a dollhouse that dad had built. Spare beds were up there, always
made up, chairs and things in case visitors came. We didn&#039;t have what was called
a spare room. It was just two big bedrooms and a full dining room and living
room and a big kitchen and a pantry, a bathroom, what we called a sun porch
where mother sewed and a big walk-in closet. I recall that between the bathroom
and the dining room that held our outerwear clothing. Something dad had built,
I&#039;ll never forget. You could go in there with the soiled laundry and when mother
change beds or whatever. I guess we were trained to use it too. You could walk
into this room where we put our outerwear clothes, and just push on this panel
and drop all of the soiled laundry and just go downstairs right by her washing
machine. It was pretty good. She didn&#039;t have to go through the sunroom, down the
steps by the back door and then down another steps--lot&#039;s of them to get to the
basement. In the basement, everybody had-- it was quite comfortable for a
basement--cement floors, of course. There was an entry to go outside in
emergencies or to come in in an emergency, in case there were tornadoes, things
like that. That was in the back of the house. Otherwise, her laundry was down
there. There was a half bathroom down there, a big furnace, because we burned
coal. That was terrible because you usually dried your hair after you washed it
over the registers, which were in every room. Of course, coal is not very clean,
and then mother would thoroughly house clean. Usually one of her sisters would
come and help with the house cleaning, spring and fall. When I look back on it,
it just amazes me, because it&#039;s hard to keep a house clean, just working at it
when you can, but they would paint and wallpaper. Every inch of everything was
cleaned thoroughly, especially because of the burning of the coal. You had the
save money. Of course, I came in the depression times, when it was even more
difficult. You had the save money all year long, so that you could buy coal in
the winter. The people who were in the coal business were very wealthy, because
they would bring it in on freight cars to the local towns. There would always be
a coal yard near the station. They would deliver the coal, and come into your
driveway. Homes did not have attached garages. They had very nice garages in the
backyard and a long driveway past the house was the usual thing. We had a
wonderful two-car garage. The trucks with the coal would back in, and then you
always had a coal shoot into the basement, a special room for the coal. It would
be dumped down the shoot, make all of this noise. It was wonderful for the kids
to see all of this. Then dear dad, if you had a father in the house, otherwise
the mother did. Divorce was really unheard of, so it was usually a family until
someone died. He&#039;d get up maybe in the middle of the night in freezing weather
to be sure that the small fire he had stoked when he went to bed didn&#039;t go out
for the morning. Then I supposed he would go down there and shovel coal. Oh,
they had lots of parties in the basement. That&#039;s where they partied. My folks
were great card players. They did that up in the dinning room. They had friends
in regularly and they went to friends&#039; homes regularly to play pinochle
primarily. Although, they also played 500. They liked both of them. It depended
on the friends with whom they were playing what they played. It was a social
activity. The radios were just coming out. There certainly was no television to
keep you from visiting the family and friends. They&#039;d make a big thing of this,
and as a little girl, I would go with them to friends&#039; homes when they&#039;d play
cards there. Usually, three or four couples would get together regularly, maybe
every other week or something. The hostess would always bake homemade cake and
stuff like that. Kids just love to have ice cream, so when the cards were over.
But the parties would be down in the basement of the homes. If somebody had a
birthday, or just getting together with friends. I can&#039;t remember reasons. My
father played the concertina, a beautiful concertina. All his life he played. I
have a picture of him in the room downstairs, when he studied concertina in
Chicago in the concertina class. He was a wonderful player, and that&#039;s what they
danced to. They loved to dance, the parents. They could bring their kids and
we&#039;d sit around and have fun and all of that. The trouble was, my mother never
got to dance with my dad, because he played the concertina. Everybody always
wanted Will to be there to play, even if it wasn&#039;t a dancing party; they would
like him to bring his concertina and play. We had the snow and the winter, and
that was fun. The heat in the summer-- oh, my goodness. The first day you could
wear anklets was such a big day. In the winter it was long underwear of course.
What did they call the pants that you wore for the-- we walked to school of
course. Twelve long black, something like that no matter what the weather. They
didn&#039;t call them leggings, it was something else, and then galoshes, they called
them, the things you put over you shoes to walk in the snow, that came up above
your ankles. They didn&#039;t have what are known as boots today. Really, really warm
clothes and poor mother who made all of our clothes. Fortunately, she was an
excellent seamstress. In the wintertime, she would pack away all of the summer
clothes, and in the summer she&#039;d have to clean up everything and get it all
ready to be packed away. The winter clothes, so that you had complete change in
everything from the bottom up-- under clothes, and outer clothes, and warm
clothes, and then sleeveless things for the terribly hot weather, and so on. It
was very interesting, and had beautiful springs and falls when the leaves turn.
Because of the many trees there, there were lots of games involving leaves.
You&#039;d make cars in the yards with leave and sit in them and pretend you were
driving and things like that. So is that about enough on my childhood?

RIGELHAUPT: That&#039;s wonderful.

ZIESENHENNE: Oh, we went to a Lutheran school, by the way. That happens to be
the denomination of Christianity I belong to. We&#039;d walk to school and I never
missed a day of school. The first day that I ever missed of school was out here
in California, and it was in high school. I contracted some disease like measles
or something like that. I haven&#039;t thought of this for so long. I was crazy
enough to call the school and see if they would let me come and just sit in the
back of the room, because it meant so much to me not to miss school. [laughs]

RIGELHAUPT: You said you have a lot of family in Hinsdale. Could you talk a
little bit about the extended family you had in Illinois?

ZIESENHENNE: My mother had an older sister who lived in Hinsdale all of her
life. She had been born out on this farm about twenty miles away. She had one
child; two had died soon after birth as I&#039;ve been told. So that cousin was very
dear to us. We only lived about six blocks away and the aunt was very dear to
us. We were back and forth. My mother and her older sister were very close. The
next sister, Martha, who came after Aunt Lina, had married a man from Wisconsin,
Milwaukee. So, she moved there after her wedding and all of the weddings were
held in home. That was the usual thing to do, to have a home big enough for your
wedding. Although it was a formal wedding, and then she moved to Milwaukee and
she had seven or eight children, and they were all our cousins. They just loved
my folks, and Milwaukee isn&#039;t that far from Chicago. You could drive it. I
forgotten, four or five hours or something like that. They would come often,
sometimes individually; sometimes several would come with their families, so
that was a big tribe of people, wonderful people. I still have cousins in
Milwaukee. Then, oh yes, there were the two boys: Will and Louis. They wanted to
be farmers like their father was. One moved to Iowa and one moved to Minnesota.
They had their families. One had three children, but the youngest died early on.
The other had two children. They each had a boy and a girl so they were our
cousins. Then another sister of my mother married a farmer and lived in the
little town, York Center, where my mother&#039;s folks had farmed. The daughter Annie
married a local farmer. So, she stayed on the farm out there, and they had four
girls and a boy who were my cousins. That was a close farm, just ten to fifteen
miles away, so we had wonderful times going out to the farm, seeing them milk
the cows. They were something. It&#039;s a great talent, which my father had, because
he grew up on a farm in Wisconsin. If you were milking the cows, the cats would
always come in. There were always cats on farms, because they wanted milk. I can
remember my dad, he would be pulling on and udder and all of the sudden he&#039;d
just bend in such a way that it would go right to the cat&#039;s face and the cat
would just sit there drinking that milk, warm milk like that. Funny what you
remember. I thought that was marvelous. So, anyway that was a lot of cousins,
and I still correspond with those who live. Oh, and on my father&#039;s side, he had
two sisters and one brother. Interestingly enough, my father and his brother,
Uncle Arnold, married two best girlfriends: my mother and Pam. My dad had two
girls, and his brother, Uncle Arnold, had two boys. So, we were cousins. We
lived maybe ten blocks apart in Hinsdale, and we were always close and had fun
with them when we would go see Grandma, because they lived near my Grandma
Floring, a couple of houses away. One sister lived on that same block, and she
had three children, twin girls and a boy who were our cousins. My aunt Marge and
her husband, uncle Arnold-- another Arnold-- they owned a cleaners and dyers in
La Grange, which was quite a nice town between Hinsdale and Chicago, and it was
a very good cleaners, so that was interesting. Once in a while I could go with
them to the cleaners, and for some reason or another I can&#039;t remember and see
the process of cleaning clothes and waiting on the customers, that sort of
thing. They had it all their life. They became very, very wealthy people. The
business was sold after the parents, my aunt and uncle died, for over a million
dollars. It was not little, but it was considered the best one in town. It was
family owned. So that was a wonderful educating experience, to understand about
the cleaning and dyeing. Because all those people I&#039;ve told you about and
others, the cousins in Iowa and Minnesota, I didn&#039;t see very often, but they
would come. All of those people, when they finally had relatives--my
family--living in California, you can bet that they all tried to save their
money, so they could travel to California. Where would they stay? Because after
all, they spent the money to come, so they shouldn&#039;t have to spend money to stay
some place, and it was unheard of that you wouldn&#039;t be hospitable. My poor
folks, they had so many visitors over the years, and you&#039;d find some place for
them to sleep. Then food all the time. Some would stay a week; some would stay a
month. That&#039;s the way it was.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you talk a little bit about moving out to California?

ZIESENHENNE: Uh-huh. My mother never told anyone but her sisters that we were
moving. I was eleven and my sister was four years older, so say she was fifteen.
We weren&#039;t really told. We knew dad had left, and I can&#039;t recall how my mother
ever could have--she must have left everything in the house except our clothes
&#039;cause that we came with. I don&#039;t know how she ever went through all of this. I
suppose she felt she couldn&#039;t stand to say good bye to anybody and she didn&#039;t
tell us until very late on and we were not going to tell anybody. Maybe four
days before we left, something like that, we were told. My aunt, Lena who lived
not to far away as I told you, she came over that night in a taxicab. It was
winter. We arrived here the last day of January, &#039;36, and there was a cab out
there, which of course we never used; that was very expensive, and beside we had
no need to have a cab. And we drove to the railroad station. So, mother must
have packed what clothes she could have. I don&#039;t remember taking apart in
anything like that. Maybe I did. My sister crying, because she had fallen in
love and was leaving a boyfriend. She never got over it all of her life. I know
she didn&#039;t; I just know, because I was her sister. We drove to the railroad
station in town, and the taxi let us off, and then I remember being on a train.
We pulled out of Hinsdale. We went to Chicago, because we had the Burlington
Railroad, running through our town. We went to Chicago. I guess it&#039;s Union
Station, and there got on a train that took us all the way from Chicago all the
way to Richmond, California. It was three days and two nights. We sat in seats
and we had taken some food with us. I don&#039;t remember if we used the dining car.
I can remember there was at least one private car. That was an amazing thing to
see. You&#039;d see it, if you go up to-- I don&#039;t know, I can&#039;t really remember,
maybe to use a restroom or just to walk to get exercise. You&#039;d have to go
between the cars. It was all quite an adventure. My sister was crying most of
the time. My poor mother, I don&#039;t know how she ever stood it all. But anyway,
the door to this private car-- there would be two doors, about half as big as a
regular door. I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve ever seen one, and maybe they changed. They
usually would be open. There was a man in there alone. Sometimes it was very
fancy. It must have been his own private railroad car, but sometimes he&#039;d be
lying on the bed asleep sort of, in his clothes, bed made, daytime. Sometimes
he&#039;d be working at a desk, and I just loved to go by there and look in and see
all of that. So, anyway, dad met us there at the station here in Richmond. He
had a car he had bought and he drove us up to the hills. If the house were not
there across the street, you could see them. They were very nice hills. There
weren&#039;t many homes up there then, and they were all covered with California
poppies. I can&#039;t say all, but I mean it was orange. They were beautiful. You see
them in the wild, when you drive around. I have some on my property. Anyway, he
drove us around the bay, and he had rented on this side of the bay, I mean.
There were not freeways. It was just San Pablo Avenue-- you&#039;ve driven on San
Pablo Avenue-- that was the artery between Richmond and Berkeley and Oakland.
The bridge was not built then. Neither bridge was built then; we took ferries.
Not that day that I arrived, of course, but he did that for us when we went to
San Francisco, very soon after. Then he had rented the flat. The house still
stands on 21st and Nevin. We had the lower flat, and the owner of the house had
the upper flat. It was a one bedroom, and we, my sister and I, slept together in
a folding bed of some kind, in the dining room. She didn&#039;t have a dining room.
She made it into a bedroom for us. That was our first day. He took us there
then. I don&#039;t remember. I suppose mom made supper or something. We lived there a
few years, and they saved money. Dad was working, making twenty-five dollars a
week, which was considered pretty good. Bread was ten cents. Very good bakery
bread. I would walk to the bakery many times on school day mornings to buy
bread-- mother would send me. So, everything is relative, the way you deal with
the price of things always constantly go up. Finally, they were able to rent a
little house a few blocks over. That was 21st and we rented a little house on
20th, one block over. Some years after that, after saving the money, they bought
their first home, here on 18th Street. So, we were always in this kind of same
neighborhood, with the same friends and schools. At that time, California was
number one in quality of schools in the United States. Hard to believe when I
read about the schools today here. We had excellent schools, and teachers, and I
loved school. I was very involved in school and in the church. We had a
neighborhood church there. It was excellent. I&#039;m so glad that we did. I think
you wanted to know something about my arriving here.

RIGELHAUPT: Okay, so you were talking about arriving in Richmond in 1936.

ZIESENHENNE: The end of January 1936. It was just a sleepy kind of town, 23,000
in population and one main street, two theatres. Very wonderful high school,
which I later went to after junior high, not far from my home. That was the hub
school for the whole area. There was no high school. The nearest high school in
the south was Berkeley, and I don&#039;t even know where the nearest high school was
north, because they were all bused in. All the high school students from all
around came to Richmond High, and it was a beautiful, beautiful school, and a
wonderful school. My father being a brickmason, when he saw it, he just couldn&#039;t
get over the beauty of it. It was built of red brick. When people would visit us
from the east, that&#039;s one place that he would take them, was to see this example
of wonderful masonry. That school was torn down completely after an earthquake
in this area, oh, I don&#039;t know now how long ago, maybe thirty years ago, because
they felt it wasn&#039;t built to be earthquake proof. Everybody felt so bad, we
still get together for our class reunions together from Richmond High, and
everybody feels so bad, because it was just destroyed. It was a lovely school.
But the one they replaced it with is now earthquake proof, but it sort of looks
like a penitentiary, protected and all.

RIGELHAUPT: When you talked about moving to California because of the
Depression, what were your impressions of Richmond when you first got here? Was
it affected by the Depression or was it different than in Illinois?

ZIESENHENNE: No, it was a lot of people like us. Everybody counted their
pennies. I guess they must have been affected as we were. We fortunately had the
church as a binding force in our lives, because we went there the first Sunday
and met people, and they became life long friends. Most of them that we met had
come here from the Midwest too. Farmers who couldn&#039;t sell their food, and all of
that stuff. Some were local people, but everybody was very frugal. Nobody did
anything that cost a lot of money. To go to movie on a Saturday was a wonderful
treat, and that was ten cents. I suppose that was for children. That was really
a treat, and you&#039;d see maybe about two feature films and a Western, and a
cartoon, just lot&#039;s of good things like that for special times you get to do
that. But anyway, the people were all nice people, good citizens. The police
would walk their beat downtown and smile and talk and if you rode a bicycle-- I
never had a bicycle, but I knew how to ride. I would ride other people&#039;s. If you
dared ride on the wrong side of the street, a policeman would stop you and
lecture you for breaking the law. It was good. The businesses were family owned
a lot of them, very nice shops. People took pride in their work. Meat markets,
and food markets, dress shops, and men&#039;s clothing stores. Shoe repair shop.
Barber shops. A wonderful store that I thought, oh my, just to spend time in it,
was called Kress&#039;s. It was a five and ten. It was a wonderful big store that was
here for years and years, and it was a five and dime, and things were actually
five and ten. It had everything. It was so enjoyable. Everybody walked downtown.
It was a big day to go downtown and see the shops and wave to people. So, it was
all kind of friendly and nice. The neighbors were nice. The neighborhood grocery
store was not far from us. We didn&#039;t always have to go downtown. So, I would say
that we were all of the same kind of people. There were few people of other
races here. I don&#039;t remember any, except a few Chinese in junior high, none in
the grammar school. When I arrived, I went right into the sixth grade at a
grammar school here. I don&#039;t remember anybody other than Caucasian students. But
in junior high, seventh, eighth and ninth, I remember Chinese, just boys and
there was a Chinese orphanage up in El Cerrito. It looked like a very nice
place. We would often drive by it, never went in it. Apparently, these must have
been orphan boys from China. I just don&#039;t know. They always wore a uniform of
some kind. It was called the Chung May home, where they lived, and they would be
brought in by bus. Those same boys went with us as we grew older on up to high
school and they were all very nice people. But in high school, I met some black
students. We called them Negro, I think, then, because they were settled out in
what was called--may still be called--North Richmond. I had a good friend in
high school, Lillian something--Ellison, I think, and her brother became a
policeman here in town, was a very nice family. That was, I think, the first
association I had ever had of anyone of other races. In the little town where I
grew up, there was one black family, so it just wasn&#039;t part of our life. That
family, I think she did housework, and I don&#039;t know what the man did. He must
have had a job, because they had children. I&#039;d go by their home now and then, as
I recall, walking from school home. So, anyway, in the schools, we had very good
teachers, and we had certainly physical education and music appreciation and
penmanship and all of those things that were very important in later life that I
don&#039;t think a lot of schools teach now. We were graded on citizenship and that
sort of thing, besides the courses that we studied.

RIGELHAUPT: Do you remember what year you started high school?

ZIESENHENNE: Well, I graduated in June of &#039;42, so it must have been September of &#039;39.

RIGELHAUPT: So, you&#039;re senior year of high school the war started?

ZIESENHENNE: Pearl Harbor, December 6 of &#039;41.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you talk about your memories of the attack on Pearl Harbor?

ZIESENHENNE: It was a Sunday, and for some reason we didn&#039;t go to church. I
think my mother was ill. Maybe I was ill. I&#039;m not sure. We were both home and
were listening to the Lutheran hour. I don&#039;t remember dad being there. Maybe he
was a church with my sister. We had the radio on to listen to that, the Lutheran
hour. It still was broadcast on Sunday morning, and it must have been around
church time, ten or eleven, something like that. We were listening to the
sermon, and all of the sudden there was this news release, and it just astounded
us that such a program would be interrupted. It was to tell us that the Japanese
had bombed Pearl Harbor that morning. We didn&#039;t even know what Pearl Harbor was
at that time. We had no idea, we had never been to Hawaii, but they said it was
in Hawaii. They didn&#039;t know too much, but that the Japanese had bombed us and
ships had been hit. It was just shocking and almost unbelievable. I can&#039;t
remember much of that day, and I was in high school and I was a senior. The next
morning, Monday, of course, was a school day, and we got to our first period
class, and an announcement came over the loud speakers, I guess, or maybe the
teachers got a phone call that we were all to report to the auditorium, the
entire student body. There everybody was just sort of in a trance almost. It was
such a shock and we could hardly believe it and really didn&#039;t know what had
happened. All we had to listen to was the radio and they didn&#039;t know much. But
gradually the news got worse. But, at any rate, we all reported to the
auditorium, and there we listened to President Roosevelt declare war on Japan.
That was really an amazing thing, and we had hardly any conception of what that
meant naturally at our age, sixteen, seventeen. So we were to graduate the
following June. Well, for that moment on, our lives were affected immensely,
because a lot of the boys made up their minds, to as soon as we graduated, to
enlist. Fellas we knew like the young men at our church, for instance, or in our
neighborhood, things like that, many of them went right away that week and
enlisted. They would have to find where the offices were, because there were no
recruiters out. They just weren&#039;t trying to get people into the services that
much, although the war in Europe was going on. But still it hadn&#039;t yet affected
us very much. Then I can remember I was a commencement speaker and I can
remember the four of us were to speak on something relative to the war. We were
assigned subjects to write our speech on. Mine was women in the war effort. So,
anyway, then the president of our class enlisted immediately. Lots of us had
plans to go to college. That changed it all, because the men wanted to enlist
for the most part, and they were sort of expected to, and the women to work in
war industry, which by June things had happened very rapidly here in Richmond.
Right on the Pacific Ocean and we had quite a few Japanese living in the area.
That&#039;s right, I went to school with a Japanese girl in high school, and she just
disappeared from class soon after, and they were sent inland, because the
government didn&#039;t trust them. We had been stabbed in the back at Pearl Harbor,
and that was just the atmosphere, but she never had a chance to say good bye to
us or anything. Actually, the Germans, although I didn&#039;t realize it so much at
the time, because a German looks like an Italian or anybody else you go to
school with, but the Germans, the same thing, they were sent inland. Of course,
I knew a lot of them, especially from church, and as friends and things, sent
away from the coast. Anyway, the girls, they were expected to support the war
effort, and give up their dreams of college, and that, I think affected many,
many people. It must have been a great drop in enlistment at the schools. So,
that&#039;s how, after the folks sent me back east to my hometown, as a graduation
gift, and when I came back, then I started looking for work.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you talk a little bit about what you remember about your
speech at the commencement, and women in the war industry? Sounds like a
fascinating speech.

ZIESENHENNE: You know what? They recorded it, and I probably have it somewhere.
You know it&#039;s one of those discs like this that would peel off as the needle
recorded your voice. I remember that so well. Well, I can&#039;t remember too well,
but I know spoke about the Red Cross, and about the military opportunities for
women and learning first aid, which is another thing. All of us, right away in
first aid classes were set up at school, and everybody was expected to take
first aid, and learn how to deal with the wounded. You we were right here--
Standard Oil, it was called then-- right here in Richmond, and the Santa Fe
Railroad. Even though the shipyards weren&#039;t built yet, they were in the throes
of building them. It was a dangerous place to live. The blackouts came quickly,
and things had to be organized so fast, and the sirens. Even driving was
affected. Things got worse and worse and worse. Gas was rationed and you
couldn&#039;t buy cars, because they stopped making cars. We had a Ford plant here in
Richmond that made cars, and a lot of the local men worked there. Well, that was
changed. All the companies could only produce what the war effort needed. So, at
Ford they made Jeeps and trucks for the army. Standard Oil, of course, was
producing oil and gas for the military vehicles in the airplanes and so on. But
railroads-- Santa Fe and Southern Pacific that come through Richmond were
transporting troops and supplies and the ships as the shipyards got built. First
Shipyard One, then Two, then Three, then Four. They worked twenty-four hours a
day, and the government took over all power, as far as employment goes. You
couldn&#039;t say, &quot;Well, I want to be a photographer or something like that.&quot; But
the War Manpower Commission was formed. That was the federal government taking
over the state employment offices. All states ran their own employment office
system to help employ people. It was hardly ever heard of, private employment
agencies, it was the state, that&#039;s where you&#039;d go. Unemployment insurance had
just been formed to help the unemployed, because of the Depression. That was
part of the employment service operation. The federal government took over after
Pearl Harbor and somehow got it all organized, and it became the War Manpower
Commission. That&#039;s where I ended up working. When I went to look for work, I
went there looking for work, and then was offered work, but I still applied in
other places, because, you know it was my first job out of high school. I came
back to the War Manpower Commission to be trained and to work, because it made
sense in talking to older people for advice. To work for the state-- it was
federal now during the war-- but there might be a future there, rather than some
of these other places who were hiring women for the first time in most cases. I
mean other than office work. But many more women than they could possibly
absorb, when they lost their war contracts, if we won the war, and if things
went back to peace. So, I thought it would be best to work for the state,
although it paid less than all the other industries. So, that&#039;s what I did, and
that&#039;s how I happened to work for them all my working life. I met my husband
there in later years.

RIGELHAUPT: I would like to get to the War Manpower Commission in just a moment,
but if you could talk about how when the war broke out in Richmond, how it
affected your family life and how it affected maybe your neighborhood and if you
remember changes in your church-- broader-- just your community.

ZIESENHENNE: I&#039;ll try to keep on the subject. I think of something--

RIGELHAUPT: No, I do want to get to the Manpower Commission. I have a whole set
of questions.

ZIESENHENNE: You just remind me if I get off. Let&#039;s take the church first. So
many people came to Richmond to work in the shipyards that it was just
overpowering in a sense, because this was just a quite, sleepy town. Most people
didn&#039;t even have a car. You&#039;d walk wherever you could, but still more and more
people had a car. The first place that people would go, when they hit town if
they were religious people was to go to church, because that&#039;s where they could
meet people. They were strangers here. Our little church, which still stands,
was small and suddenly we were having a hall full of little children, coming for
Sunday School. If you&#039;re a church member, that&#039;s a great blessing. There are
families coming. It seems like that the war had done something to people to make
them more anxious to learn about God, and so on. Then they set up two services
to hold in the church. Then the church wasn&#039;t big enough anyway. I don&#039;t know
people gave money, whatever they did, and they enlarged the church and pushed
out walls and added. It was a marvelous time for the churches, all of them,
because of this, and many of these people stayed on and still live here, and
their heirs live here, today. So, it was a great missionary effort really. There
were so many people to deal with. Then in the home, well, of course, so many
things were rationed: shoes, nylon hose, food, especially meat, butter, sugar, gasoline.

RIGELHAUPT: If we could just pause right there. I have to change the tapes.

ZIESENHENNE: Sure, sure.

[End Audio File ZIESENHENNE: l1 02-12-03.wav]

[Begin Audio File ZIESENHENNE: l2 02-12-03.wav]

RIGELHAUPT: Okay let&#039;s start that one. So the audio&#039;s going.

ZIESENHENNE: I guess it was how the war was affected family life and the church
and the town and everything.

RIGELHAUPT: So, before I changed tapes you were talking a little bit about how
the start of World War II changed life in your church, and you just started
talking about rationing. If you could continue with that.

ZIESENHENNE: Uh-huh. Well, I think we each got a ration stamp book of each child
and parents or whoever lived in the house. That had to last you for a certain
length of time, so I think it averaged out to like-- you might be able to buy
two pair of shoes a year or something like that. Nylons-- of course I was at the
age now, eighteen, sort of, seventeen, eighteen. I graduated at seventeen. You
just ended up using-- what did they call it? Well, it was a brown kind of lotion
you rubbed on your legs and you bought it in the bottle, because you just
couldn&#039;t get nylons, you just couldn&#039;t. They were using them for parachutes,
things like that. I tell you the nylons that we had then, back in &#039;42 were
really nylons. They did not run. Now you will not find a pair of stockings like
that today, because if they still manufactured them, those were the first nylons
after silk stockings. They&#039;d never sell any, because they wouldn&#039;t run, you see.
So they could not produce, and still don&#039;t today what we had then. It was
marvelous nylon. That went to war too. Well, that&#039;s right Lucky Stripe went to
war. That&#039;s another funny thing that happened. Cigarettes were rationed, and
everybody smoked. You&#039;d go to the doctor; the doctor would be interviewing you
and smoking. In the high school, the teacher&#039;s lounge, smoke just poured out of
the door, because all the teachers smoked. Of course, all the teachers smoked.
Of course, it&#039;s an exaggeration. I&#039;m sure there were some that didn&#039;t. It was
just part of life to smoke. People who didn&#039;t smoke seemed odd, once they were
high school or older. Now, it&#039;s just the opposite, which is good. I gave up
smoking years ago thanks goodness, but I was certainly part of the crowd,
because cigarettes were {__}. No, I don&#039;t think they rationed them, but they all
went to war, and the stores couldn&#039;t get them. I think they thought it would
just be too much to ration them and handle stamps for cigarettes, because
someone had to buy cartons and some just could afford packages. The servicemen
they all smoked. Well, anyway, in the office where I worked here in town we were
one of the busiest of any place, because of the shipyards. All of the war
industries here. Everybody had to get a clearance from us who wanted to work.
You could not work unless you had a War Manpower clearance to prove you could,
that you were free to take that job. It was really amazing how people
cooperated. You&#039;d come in looking for work, and everybody had to do that. They
had to clear through us. The law was there, and they obeyed it. If you wanted to
be a bartender, or something that did not have to do with the war effort, you
could as a second job. That&#039;s how they were able to fill these jobs like
waitress, and so on, but your main job had to be in the war industry. Well,
anyway these people would fill our office. The line is out the street and
somebody would yell in the side door, &quot;Cigarettes at Safeway.&quot; There was a
Safeway Store a block away. Everybody ran. This would only happen maybe once
every two months or something. I tell you, it was just a stampede of people,
workers and the public running down to Safeway. Of course the supply would be
exhausted in no time. This went on all over I&#039;m sure. Of course, because the
military could get cigarettes, it was nice to have friends who were in the
military. Likewise with other things. So, anyway, that affected our life. At
night, everybody had to have blackout curtains, so that no light could be seen
coming from your windows. Every block had a warden in charge. One of the people
who lived there, one of your neighbors was appointed a warden. They would be out
inspecting. No light could be seen. If you were going to open the front door and
you had lights on, you better turn off those light before you opened the door.
Of course there were not porch lights. There were no street lights. It could
have been a very dangerous time, because you didn&#039;t want to give any enemy
bombers probably a look at what was below if you could help it. So, if you were
driving in a car, which you did very seldom because of the gasoline going to
war. When the sirens blew, you had to pull over, because you had to turn off the
car lights. They did allow you to drive with your lights on, but they preferred
you just stay off of the streets anyway at night. If you were out, you had to
pull over and wait until the all clear sounded. So that was quite an impact on
people. Naturally, your menu changed and your clothing changed. I was telling
you about this liquid that you rubbed on your legs instead of stockings. Well,
even though there was a war effort and women worked actually doing men&#039;s work in
the shipyards. Also some of the other firms hired them in industry like
operators for Standard Oil and so on. Still in office work, you wouldn&#039;t think
of wearing slacks. We wore suits and tailored dresses and heels, hose. They
would wear out and you couldn&#039;t really get anymore. Then we&#039;d have to paint our
legs and that was such a mess, because, you know, every morning you&#039;d have to
put your leg up on a stool and get this stuff, pour it in your hands, rub it all
over your legs, be careful not to get it on your clothes until it dried, and
then wash you hands, you know. But we lived through that. Some gals were so
careful that they&#039;d even had a special pencil. They&#039;d draw a line up the back of
their legs and make it look as if it was a seam, because we never, never wore
slacks in the office. But out of the war I think came, afterwards-- you know a
lot of women had worn slacks in their work, in the industrial type of work, and
it just affected the styles of people. They wore them to church and even
weddings. Pant suits; you see them all over.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you talk about when you started working for the War Manpower
Commission and talk about how you got the job?

ZIESENHENNE: Well I went in to place an application just for work, to give your
general application to fill out, and I filled it out, and then was interviewed
by someone there. It still wasn&#039;t just filled with people. This would have been
about October of &#039;42. The Shipyards had to be built. Now that was a big, big
excavation job, especially in the bay down here, to make it deep enough for the
ships to be launched. It wasn&#039;t just a matter of putting up buildings. So, we
didn&#039;t quite have the great crowds of people coming in to that office, when I
went into apply, as perhaps six months later, when they&#039;d been able to get the
things ready in the shipyards. The other buildings for the most part were here.
We had some good industries in Richmond. They didn&#039;t have to be built. They just
had to change what they were doing, to make it related to the war effort. But
the shipyards had to be built on marshlands, and everything out there had to be
built. So, it took longer, and then recruiting the people, because they never
closed, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day and the other firms also.
Well, I went in then to look for work and I was interviewed and think I was
called at home to say that they would like to have me to start there and so on.
I think I explained to them that I appreciated that and that I would think about
it, because I wanted to apply at some other places too, which I did. Then I
finally decided, although I was offered other jobs, as a trainee-- this would be
my first job-- but I just decided to work there. I started there. At a certain
point, people were coming in for their War Manpower clearances. I probably just
started in reception or something like that. I hadn&#039;t had much training yet, but
I did get lots of training, both on the job special classes, sometimes going to
San Francisco. I did a lot of reading and all of that. Kaiser was recruiting
primarily in the Deep South, where there was never much employment, and a lot of
very poor people. Now, that&#039;s not to say that people didn&#039;t come from all over
the United States to work in the shipyards. Farmers left the farming, and that
was a real impact on the food market, because farmers are vital to our economy
and to the health of the nation. But especially the young men, like a lot of my
cousins gave up farming at that point, never went back to it. I&#039;m sure they were
typical. They came seeking money, and they shipyards of all things, for somebody
who had never worked, had no skills--what I mean is like say if, coming off the
farm, or coming from unemployed areas. Still coming out of the Depression in a
sense, could start at like seventy-five cents an hour. Most laboring jobs,
unskilled and some of them, they helper jobs like boilermaker helper, welder
helper, sheet metal helper. All the trades had helper jobs. And ninety-five
cents an hour. Now, that was really something. The shipyards probably paid more
than any of the other industries. It was difficult to get people accept jobs in
other industries. It was our responsibility to try to man all of the war-related
industries. Like I say, the Santa Fe Railroad, which probably paid the least.
[sirens in background] Of course, I&#039;m going back many years in my memory.
Naturally, the people wanted to-- is that going to bother your-- you don&#039;t know?
That&#039;s my friends the fireman. They always go by my home. Santa Fe needed people
desperately. A lot of their people had gone off to war, and had been drafted. It
was a constant cycle of need for people to work, but also need for people to go
into the military. If you could almost just breath, there was something for you
to do. Kaiser was very good about that. But, I must finish what I was saying
about Santa Fe. We could offer three jobs to a person looking for work-- or they
could be offered one, two or three. That was all you could offer them. Then you
could send them any place on that interview, if they would not take one of the
top three, and we constantly would be getting information from the War Manpower
Commission head offices as to which industry, which firm in the Richmond area
needed people most. We had to try to fill those top slots. Sometimes it wasn&#039;t
what the people wanted. So, it was not easy dealing with that problem, but they
had to be staffed. The railroads especially are known for their low pay, really
needed people in transportation. There were constant problems. Employers, in
order to do as much as they could to hire people, asked for room in our
offices-- a desk so that they could be right there and the people didn&#039;t have to
come to them, to waste time and effort. Some employers actually rented trailers
or bought trailers and had them parked out on the street so that they would just
interview right there. The shipyards, Kaiser, of course, who had the money to do
it all along had their own huge building in Richmond where they did their
hiring. So, if we were referring to them with a clearance, they just had to walk
three blocks and there would be the Kaiser hiring hall. The unions became very
powerful through the shipyards coming here. The unions had a great deal to say
about who would be taken in. My memories of Kaiser generally, have never been
very good because he made a great deal of money and gave many people employment,
but when the war was over, everything was shut down, and he left, and left
Richmond with the terrible, terrible problem of unemployment. We grew from
twenty-three thousand to a hundred thousand people in this little town. Just
almost, to exaggerate, overnight, they started coming right after Pearl Harbor
actually. The word would get out that Kaiser was going to build shipyards or
there were other shipyards up the coast and down in Los Angeles and on the East
Coast and so on. It was a terrible thing that happened to Richmond. Of course,
I&#039;ve jumped ahead an awful lot.

RIGELHAUPT: I would like to get there, but we&#039;ll just stay with the War Manpower
Commission for a couple of moments.

ZIESENHENNE: Well, another thing that I admired Kaiser, who did so much in the
area, was that he said he would hire any handicap person. He told us that. His
representatives told us that. That was almost unheard of. It was very difficult
prior to the war to find work for physically or mentally handicapped people. I
think they call them something else now. We had specialists in every one of our
offices who dealt with handicap people prior to the war, and made great efforts
to help them but employers were always resistant, lot&#039;s of times for insurance
purposes. It was just very difficult for anybody who was disadvantaged, because
of their disability. With Kaiser, any handicap would be hired. He&#039;d find
something. There was never a problem. I give him so much credit; well, of
course, those very same people were here when it was all over too. Anyway, that
was wonderful. He was recruiting now all over the United States, but mostly in
the Deep South. His special recruiting trains would take him and he&#039;d fill that
whole train and then come back to Richmond. That was a Sixteenth and Macdonald.
Out office was down at Sixth and Nevin, one block off of Macdonald, our main
street still today. We were in the old post office. We&#039;d finally taken that
over. His men would walk all of those hundred of people--everyday a train would
come in-- down from the station, down Nevin, to our office, before they went any
place. They still didn&#039;t have a place to live, all of those problems. A lot of
them had children. Many sent for them later to come on in to us to be
interviewed. Many couldn&#039;t write. Many couldn&#039;t read. Many had never been away
from their little bitsy town wherever they lived, and probably didn&#039;t go to
school. Some [had] very serious health problems and so on. They had to see us
for this War Manpower clearance. Now, they already had a job promised them. All
they needed was the clearance and that was to the shipyards. Those people really
recruited, and those were the parents of the people who-- most of them who
stayed here, lived here and worked here, the citizens of our city. That was a
tremendous pressure on us. We&#039;d work hours and hours, and through the weekend
sometimes, because they needed these bodies to get those ships done. Now, one of
the places--oh, yes, I forgot about that. One of the places I do volunteer work
is the Richmond Museum and I know quite a bit about shipyard work even though I
never worked there, because of the displays they have. Some of those big ships
were from the very beginning to the day they went out into the water, was three
days. I think of that. It&#039;s beyond conception. Huge, huge ships that carried
supplies primarily to the military. So, we worked with people to the point of
exhaustion. We ourselves had our difficulty getting workers to help us. So, we
met many people, had lots of experiences and tried to help them the best we
could. Of course, all those people think what it did to our schools. They had no
place to sleep many of them. It was nothing to have strangers ring your doorbell
and see if you had a bedroom you&#039;d be willing to rent out. Some would rent a
bedroom and three different people would rent it, and they&#039;d work different
shifts and that bed would always be used. That sort of thing you know. Odd
looking little sheds went up in many yards. Just a room for a man to sleep so
that he could get back to work. Restaurants somehow they would come from here
and there and the little sleepy town that had maybe two little restaurants--you
needed to feed these people. The kids needed to go to school and there were just
these few schools. The housing authority built places as fast as they could, a
lot of them not built so well. Just a place where people could live. All of it
has been destroyed except one that&#039;s down at the end of Macdonald Avenue that
was well built and still was used to today. But, I don&#039;t know how they lived
through it with the schools and not enough teachers and supplies and the things
that they did. Of course, personally we had relatives that came out here to work
here in the shipyards. I can&#039;t even remember them all. Of course, they all
wanted to stay with us. We had couches; we couldn&#039;t take them all. Mother and
Dad, I don&#039;t know how they managed it all, but we did what we could, and so did
everybody else to help the war effort.

RIGELHAUPT: I was wondering if you could talk about a typical day at the War
Manpower Commission for you. What was it like?

ZIESENHENNE: A lot would depend upon what you were assigned to do. Usually there
would be promotions along the way, or transfers along the way and so on, but for
the most part, the heavy part of the war was speaking to people. We had got so
busy that finally you could almost have nobody at a desk. They&#039;d make the
counters with spaces and a tall stool with the backrest. Most of us all had to
work there, because these lines never ended until we locked the doors and just
finished who was there, and the rest would have to come back the next day. You&#039;d
have your file of jobs and classifications and you&#039;d have to do interviewing and
offering of employment. When I reached that kind of work, I started out doing
just reception and then learning other things, training of other people who had
been in employment prior to the war. You&#039;d get a break maybe for fifteen minutes
in the morning, ten minutes in the afternoon, and your lunch hour. Otherwise,
just this pressure. We didn&#039;t even have telephones at the counters. They would
have to be handled by somebody who just handled phone calls, so that we could
just wait on the people. Sometimes there would be difficulties with the people,
because this was there life and work. Also we had returning veterans coming
back, who many had been injured by this time. They needed employment too. They
were out to the service. We had a veteran representative in each office. Those
people would always been seen as a desk--anybody just out the service. They of
course had precedence on any job. We met lots and lots of interesting people,
and I think, did a remarkable job considering the difficulty of it all.

RIGELHAUPT: Could I follow up a little bit on-- you said interesting people. A
lot of the people were coming from the South, you say. Was this a racially
diverse group?

ZIESENHENNE: Well, that&#039;s a good point. I should have thought of that. Oh my
yes. Especially black people from the South came, and they were so eager to
work, and there was no problem with the shipyards. Now, there was no obligatory
rule that minorities had to be employed as there is now, so there would be
companies in town who would not say so, but you knew that black people or maybe
other people too-- I should say minorities, I guess, would not be employed if
they did go there. But, still, you would try to fill these positions and send
people. It was all part of the problem. We went through a lot of new things that
were brought to us. Originally, employers could say very openly, &quot;white only&quot; on
their job orders. That was perfectly all right. I remember one especially well
known company that just were adamant about that even in the war effort, because
that was the life at that time.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you say which company that was?

ZIESENHENNE: That was the Oakland Tribune. I remember that, because you see
after the war, I married someone I worked with, and we couldn&#039;t work together,
because money was handled for unemployment insurance. That was the rule. We were
back to the state by that time, and I finished my working years at the Oakland
office. I know there were other companies. I shouldn&#039;t just single the Tribune
out, but I remember the personnel person so well, because she was so difficult
about that. Now, they&#039;d be shocked to even hear that. Of course, it affected the
lives of all people, because for the first time, many people were dealing with
people of other races. You know that&#039;s been a learning experience for everybody
who lived here, in the schools and all that. It helped them to improve their
lives and so on. The war had so many effects, I guess you couldn&#039;t stop talking
about it and think of everything that went on. Richmond had many servicemen
stationed here to protect us and to protect this area. We had three, I believe,
batteries of army men stationed here. One at a school in Point Richmond, one up
toward Pinole, on the hill there, and oh, one on Macdonald Avenue in our
Memorial Hall. That was there home; that&#039;s where they were stationed. Golden
Gate Fields, which is a race track out here, that was taken over by the Navy,
and the sailors were stationed out there all during the war. Marines were never
stationed here, but on Treasure Island. We would see a lot of them too.
Servicemen could work on their off hours if they wanted to also, and earn extra
money. So, we&#039;d see quite a few of them. Then, of course the USO was a very
integral part of life for people in the service, and for the single women in the
area, of which I was one.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you talk about where you were living during the war and the
broader--I understand there housing shortages.

ZIESENHENNE: Well, I still lived with my folks. I was working and I lived at
home. We had bought the home on Eighteenth Street. Well you don&#039;t know the city,
but it&#039;s sort of in the area where we started. Just maybe six, seven blocks
away, they had found a home they could afford [where] I lived when I went to
high school and I started working at seventeen-- eighteen I guess, when I
started working. I didn&#039;t marry until I was twenty-three, so I was home six
years, and that was all during the war. So, I didn&#039;t go through any of this
living in war housing like so many did.

RIGELHAUPT: Did your office help people with housing at all?

ZIESENHENNE: No, maybe the employers did, because they would do anything to get
people to work for them. Maybe they did in their own way. Perhaps I&#039;ve
forgotten. You can imagine the problems with a woman, who let&#039;s say who had
children. Maybe even her husband had gone in the service. Lots of them did, even
with children, because we were fighting two wars at the same time. She wanted to
help the war effort, but more importantly to make money too. She needed someone
to look after her children. It was almost impossible to hire a woman to look
after children or to do housework, or even men to work in the yard or anything
like that, for somebody who really needed someone, because they could all get
these war jobs that paid so much more.

RIGELHAUPT: You mentioned that the city grew a lot in population. Could you talk
a little bit about what you think the city did well to handle all of the new
people coming and what they had problems with?

ZIESENHENNE: Well, not having worked for the city, I didn&#039;t have firsthand
knowledge, just really what I observed and people I knew, and so on. I really
think they did a fabulous job, considering everything. It must have been a
tremendous thing to try to absorb those people. Like I said, they needed a place
to sleep, and they needed a place to eat, and they had to have their personal
things cared for like laundry done. They didn&#039;t bring anything like that with
them. Most of them seemed to just come with a suitcase. They didn&#039;t bring
furniture or anything. Maybe they had it shipped in later, but we had one
transfer and storage company. They were neighbors of ours when we lived on
Twentieth Street. The father and his two sons, who were a little older that we
were, had started this moving and storage firm. He had two trucks before the
war. Suddenly this happens, and then he did the moving for people, just odds and
ends and made a decent living. They had a little house near us, and a big corner
to park his trucks in. He finally built a little building for them. Here comes
this deluge of thousands and thousands of people, and I guess many did send for
their furniture or what they wanted out here. They could hardly buy anything
anyway. He was so busy and his two sons, they moved things even at night. He
made money so fast that he somehow got other trucks. If you weren&#039;t in the
military, you really couldn&#039;t buy anything. How he did it, I don&#039;t know. Maybe
he bought second hand things, I don&#039;t recall. He did get other trucks. He was
the only company moving things for a long, long time. They became so wealthy.
That&#039;s another private story of the war. Those two sons became millionaires in
their lifetime. That company is still there, Richmond Transfer and Storage. And
then, of course, other companies came in. Kaiser was maybe responsible for that,
because his people had to have things. I just happened to think of them, the
Johnson&#039;s. Did I get off the track there?

RIGELHAUPT: No that was great. With all of those new people coming into the
city, do you remember if people lived in different neighborhoods? Were there
neighborhoods that were predominantly African American or predominantly, say,
Italian? Do you remember how people settled?

ZIESENHENNE: Well, of course, I was always in the same place. There were no
black people in our neighborhood and never had been. This is a reasonably new
development, the City of Richmond. By reasonable, I mean like from the twenties
probably. There are just comfortable family homes, like maybe some that you see
around here. The black people, that I mentioned that I met in high school, lived
in what we call North Richmond. I imagine that most of them lived in the war
housing, because most of them came in at this time. The federal government built
that war housing, not the city. I think they had to get on lists. I don&#039;t know
where people lived before they got into war housing. I have friends today that
actually lived in war housing, because the lived with their family at that age.
There was a lot of it throughout the city. Wherever there were vacant lots,
they&#039;d try to build something. So, I would say, where the war housing was, there
were just mixtures of people. Never was there anything all black or all white,
but as blacks or other groups of people came in, they&#039;d get on the list and live
in the war housing I would suppose, until the war was over, and then they had to
find their own place to live, because most of them were torn down.

RIGELHAUPT: You mentioned housing at the end of Macdonald.

ZIESENHENNE: That&#039;s still there. It&#039;s called Atchison Village. Macdonald is a
main street. If you get on Macdonald, which is about five blocks over and take
it to the very end, you&#039;ll see it. The very end is the Santa Fe Railroad. You
can&#039;t go any further. You can just turn left and go to Point Richmond, a lovely
place. Have you ever been to Point Richmond? Hotel Mac and all that. I went to
school with the Mac boys. So, anyway, Atchison Village is on your left-hand
side, and those housing units still stand, and I think each unit had maybe two
flats here, and two flats here. They&#039;re owned by the people who live in them
now. Whatever they are living in. They were federal housing. Only one is left in
the Richmond area.

RIGELHAUPT: I was wondering if you remember the Port Chicago
explosion?ZIESENHENNE: Yes, I was lying in my bed, and I think it too was a
Sunday, and I had my own bedroom there on Eighteenth Street. My sister had
married and moved out, so I had her room. I hadn&#039;t fallen asleep yet, and
suddenly there was this great jarring movement, and the bed moved. It seemed
like everything in the room moved. I don&#039;t know if I heard anything, but
something terrible had happened. You just knew that, like if maybe the house
next door had exploded or something. It was hard to believe when we heard the
news, probably the next day. I don&#039;t recall whether I got out of bed, talk to my
parents or what. It was that far away at Port Chicago, and I felt this terrible
explosion through the foundation of the house.

RIGELHAUPT: What do you remember what it was like at the end of the war? Do you
remember where you were, what you were doing when you heard the war was over?

ZIESENHENNE: Uh-huh. I was at work. Somebody must have yelled or opened the
door, or somebody was maybe out on their break. We had a lot of newspaper boys
in those days who would go out during the war, yelling &quot;Extra, extra!&quot; and had
their newspapers in their hand. They&#039;d go into the residential areas and
everything. You don&#039;t even have paperboys on bikes anymore. These would be
walking, and I think maybe that&#039;s how we got the news, although somebody could
have had a radio on. Anyway, suddenly everybody was just yelling, &quot;The war is
over! The war is over!&quot; We just tumbled out of the building on to the street. It
was like party time. That night I went to San Francisco with girl friends--you
could do it in those days and know you&#039;d get home safely-- to walk up and down
Market Street celebrating because the war was over, blowing horns and things.
Just what they always used to do on New Year&#039;s Eve. You&#039;d go to San Francisco
and walk up and down Market Street, and then go home [laughs], but that was the
way to celebrate. That&#039;s how we celebrated the end of the war. Of course, there
was the terrible news about the bomb that had been dropped and the people who
were killed and suffered and all of that. It&#039;s all a part of war.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you talk about how the city changed after the war?

ZIESENHENNE: I suppose just in dribs and drabs, because everybody it seemed was
looking for work, and finally some would give up and go elsewhere to find it, or
maybe go back home. These war industries had shut down, and those who could went
back to what they were doing before, and not all of them did that. They couldn&#039;t
use all the people they had used to fill their war contracts, because they
government wasn&#039;t helping them pay the wages anymore in getting them the
contracts. For instance, we had one of the finest companies in Richmond. They
were here when we moved here in &#039;36, until the war effort when they were
switched, but they made bathtubs and toilets and sinks. American Radiator and
Standard Sanitary, a very fine company. I toured it. We used to visit local
companies to get firsthand knowledge of the jobs and so on. I&#039;ve forgotten what
they made for the war effort. They didn&#039;t go back into business after the war. I
don&#039;t know what happened to them. I know that&#039;s not the only company. We lost
lots of jobs, of course. With the closure of the shipyards, the contracts being
cancelled for the war effort, it was pretty tough. The city had really rough
times. Places that had been built to serve the people, they either didn&#039;t have
the money or they weren&#039;t here any longer. Although we still maintained, I
think, around ninety thousand here in this area. I imagine the city did what
they could. I wasn&#039;t involved in it then. I have one son and he was a city
councilman here for twelve years, and I learned a lot about city government from
him. I&#039;m sure that this is a city council form of government, and I&#039;m sure that
the city council had their hands full, trying to deal with all of these
problems, and of course, they built schools. The federal government had built
schools here, and all of those needs, and now people had to be transferred out,
because they didn&#039;t have as many children, because people had to work, and if
they couldn&#039;t find it here, many left. There was a lot of unrest too. I don&#039;t
know if you are aware of that, but at sometime--let&#039;s see, maybe thirty years
ago, there was a riot here in Richmond. It was a terrible thing on Macdonald
Avenue. Storefronts were broken into. Many things were damaged, terrible things
done. I believe it was all based on unemployment and unrest. People just
couldn&#039;t take it anymore. Where it had been good times, it wasn&#039;t. Maybe their
unemployment had run out. But anyway, crowd after crowd, lots of black people
involved. I wasn&#039;t there so I can&#039;t tell you first hand. Far from it, everybody
was very frightened. I knew business people who just left town then. They just
would not stay. Some of our best stores closed and took off. Actually what
happened was, it destroyed our downtown. We&#039;ve never come back from it. What the
city did was to build--or whoever, I shouldn&#039;t say the city, but they had to
give licenses for it-- what is called Hilltop Shopping Center. You ever been out
there? That&#039;s what grew up then. So, if you want to shop anyplace in Richmond,
you really don&#039;t go to downtown Richmond you have to go outside of the city. It
was really a tragedy. Our library was down on Fourth and Nevin, where we would
walk at night, when we were in school, to study. Now, you could never do that.
Just too many people, and too many problems. It sounds like we have another
garbage man friend. We would pick Wednesday for this area.

RIGELHAUPT: I was wondering how you see Richmond today: positives and negatives.

ZIESENHENNE: Well, I&#039;ve never moved out. My husband and I decided. A lot of
people moved out because the high crime rate, the high murder rate. There are a
lot of negatives. One is the shopping, because that is not convenient any more.
I&#039;ve reached the point where I won&#039;t even drive freeways, and I don&#039;t like to go
up to Hill Top, or have to get out and go that far to do my shopping. There&#039;s
nothing for me downtown. Even the banks and things are gone. From Sixteenth
Street on down. So, my feeling about the city: it&#039;s my home, I have my church
here, I have family and friends here, lots of good old friends still are here,
but not necessarily in Richmond. A lot of them have moved to the outskirts, like
El Cerrito or El Sobrante or Pinole, even further away. Those that I see, I keep
in touch with quite a few. It&#039;s just my home, and I&#039;ve gotten to know many, many
people. My son lives here, and through him also, I&#039;ve widened my circles. When
you say you are from Richmond, you can always sort of sense a pause or some
thought that they are kind of surprised, because Richmond is kind of low on the
social scale, as far as reputation goes. It has wonderful people of all races,
and I&#039;ve met many. For instance, I&#039;m just in an average kind of neighborhood. We
are all close neighbors, especially this block right here. There have been some
new ones over here, but some of them have been here a long time. I&#039;ve live here
in this house about forty-five years. Across the street there&#039;s a wonderful
Chinese family. He teaches Chinese and English in Chinatown, and she works as a
maid in one of the big hotels in San Francisco, has for years. She gets up at
the crack of dawn, get home at six o&#039;clock at night. They&#039;ve raised three
children, put them all through college. The oldest is a man. He is now in his
first year as an attorney in Washington D.C. with the FBI, hoping to get
transferred here. He&#039;s not married. The two girls both now college graduates and
into their further training-- One to be a pharmacist, one to be a gynecologist.
She&#039;ll finish in June, her internship. Isn&#039;t that marvelous? Then we have a
Caucasian, divorced mother with two grown daughters. Then we have a black, I
think divorced man, with a grown son. Then we have a black couple, man and
woman. She&#039;s a retired teacher, and he&#039;s retired from something. Up at this
corner we have a black widow living. Next door, a Caucasian couple with their
son. They are good neighbors. They are all good neighbors. We&#039;re all friends.
Here we have rather new homeowners, Caucasians. Just for a few more, let&#039;s see.
Diagonal from them is a black family. She takes care of children, so she has a
lot of black children coming and going. Caucasian couple. These are students,
like maybe at Cal or something, a group over here right across from me. A
Spanish family in the next house. He&#039;s a chef at a German restaurant in San
Francisco. In the next house, there&#039;s an interesting group. They haven&#039;t been
there too long. They all paint, the men, and there seems to be a crowd of them.
They go out in their painting clothes and trucks in the morning. I don&#039;t really
know them. So, that&#039;s just my typical neighborhood. It&#039;s home. You just adjust
with what you have to do. I just wanted to stay here, and we did that. My son is
happy here, and his wife is just from El Cerrito, so her family is here. You
can&#039;t change the world, but I just felt a responsibility to stay here. If all
good citizens move, what happens to the city?

RIGELHAUPT: That&#039;s the last question I have. Is there anything you&#039;d like to add?

ZIESENHENNE: I wonder what time it is. How long have I been talking? [laughs] Is
it one o&#039;clock?

RIGELHAUPT: Five &#039;til.

ZIESENHENNE: Oh, my gosh. One thing I want to add? Let me think. Well, let&#039;s
see. I told you worked for the Richmond Museum, which I find very interesting,
because it&#039;s all the history of Richmond. Because it&#039;s so far down at the end of
town, where people don&#039;t care to go, because of problems that develop. But they
don&#039;t get many people to come and see this wonderful museum that tells the
history of Richmond in actual room layout, in wonderful photographs and
displays. I wish more people were aware of that. If you ever have time to come
into Richmond, you&#039;d really profit by seeing it. Seeing the shipyards and
pictures of the ships that were built. Gosh, amazing things. The first Ford that
was ever built at the Ford Motor Company we had down there. There were some
great things. Well, later in life, I finally got back to college. I could tell
you that. My son was his senior year at Cal and I was still going there. I went
to Junior College two years, and then finished at Cal and got a B.A. in English
in &#039;79. It took me a while to get through junior college, because I took minimum
hours and worked at the same time. I stopped that when I started as a junior at
Cal, because I couldn&#039;t handle it, so I took full time units up there. That was
an enjoyable experience. It meant more to me, because I waited so long to go
back to school. Once you start working, it&#039;s easy enough to go back. So, I had
to finally go, when my son was about ready to go. It was fun. We&#039;d wave to each
other. I think that is about it. I&#039;ve been widowed for--it&#039;s going on twenty
years. I live here in this house alone. I enjoy it; I enjoy taking care of it. I
do a lot of things. I&#039;m a busy person. That&#039;s probably good. I amazed the phone
hasn&#039;t rung. I&#039;m very thankful. We had garbage trucks, but no phone ringing.
I&#039;ve had some interesting experiences and enjoyed it all. I lost a lot of
friends in the war. The president of our class was killed in action. Lots of
boys from out church. It has a very tragic side. When I hear them talking today
about the situation, you think on both sides when you are older and have been
through those things, because maybe war is the answer, but on the other hand, it
has terrible sides to it. It could be worse this time than last.

RIGELHAUPT: We&#039;ll stop right there.
