CANDIDA SMITH: We&#039;re going to start today by discussing your relations with
Congressman Miller&#039;s office, the support you got from him, and what that told
you about what people were expecting from the Park.

HART: Well, I have the highest regard for Congressman George Miller, personally,
professionally. He was head of the Natural Resources Subcommittee in the House
for many years and was in a very influential position for the National Park
Service in that role, and was, you know, wise and thoughtful and creative and
intelligent, and a wonderful person.

He tried very hard to help the Park, but was limited in key ways. When the
administration changed he became identified as not only an influential and
powerful Democrat but one of those passionately opposed to President [George W.]
Bush and the Republican administration. That, of course, limited his ability to
influence the National Park Service, because to influence the National Park
Service he had to first influence the Department of the Interior, of which we
are a member, and in a Republican administration the appointees to a department
are Republicans, so he had his hands tied behind his back in many ways.

He wrote the Park Service, he met with the Regional Director, he requested
adequate and expanded operational funding for the Park. The first letter, to
John Reynolds, got a polite response in writing, but nothing happened. The
Congressman wrote a second letter to the new Regional Director Jon Jarvis, but
nothing came of it. So that was very disappointing, and didn&#039;t improve relations
between me and assorted regional officials.

Congressman Miller was very supportive for the events we put on in Rosie. Our
first big event was a thank you celebration on board the SS Red Oak Victory
honoring the Congressman, and retiring Regional Director John Reynolds.
Congressman Miller also cut the ribbon for the interim visitor center that we
created in the lobby of City Hall. He lent his considerable stature to the
fledgling Park and was greatly appreciated.

When Congressman Miller was Chairman of the Resources Subcommittee in the House,
his Chief of Staff was John Lawrence, who has a PhD in history, loved Rosie,
thought it was a wonderful idea, was very involved in the early stages of the
legislation, the hearing, getting it off the ground. But then Congressman
Miller--the whole Park was kind of a thank-you present to him, because he was
leaving to go to the Education Committee, so he lost his influence in that
regard as well. He was no longer our substantive subcommittee person on the
Hill, and John Lawrence moved over to the Education Committee as well. But John
Lawrence stayed very interested, and he came out to visit the Park a couple of
times while I was there. I&#039;d gotten to know him during the legislative phase,
liked him very much, and admired him a great deal.

I gave him a tour of the Park, and at the end of it he said something like, &quot;We
may have created something impossible here.&quot; Those weren&#039;t his words, but that
was certainly the meaning. And he said--the part I remember word for word was,
&quot;You&#039;re here for the duration, right?&quot; And I went home, and I was so angry. I
thought, &quot;You know, John, you just agreed that you&#039;ve created, potentially, an
impossible piece of legislation, and you, John Lawrence, are saying to me, &#039;Judy
Hart, Judy, you&#039;re going to stay here till it works, right?&#039;&quot; And that was about
year two, I guess, and it was one of those moments--to be honest, as much as I
admired John, and I knew he meant well, and he meant it as a compliment that I
would stay and somehow make it work, if it could be made to work. I know he
meant it that way. But I went home and thought, &quot;What am I doing here? Why am
I--you know, everybody, or nearly everybody seems to think this Park&#039;s
impossible. Why am I the only one who&#039;s trying to make it work? Maybe it is
impossible. Why am I beating my head against a wall?&quot; I did a lot of journaling
and reflection on that. It was a pivotal moment in those four years, but John
never knew it. He said it just as he got in his car and drove off.

Well, I should add that, of course, this Park was not what Congressman Miller
had in mind. His legislation was to add the Rosie memorial to the Park Service
as an affiliated area, a very simple project; that was his idea. The Park
Service came up with the idea of the Park, and wrote the legislation, designed
the whole concept, and worked with him, but handed him a very different package
from what he requested. So the full Rosie Park as we know it was not what he
envisioned, and I think that he, like many people, frankly, were waiting to see
if it could be made to work. He understood how complicated it was and how
tenuous it was to have the City of Richmond somehow find the money, millions and
millions of dollars, to create a National Park. And the county to find millions
of dollars to help create a National Park was a stretch of an idea, still is a
stretch of an idea.

I had the sense that he and many other people were waiting for some sort of
critical mass to come together to support. I always felt that--in order to
really effectively work to get adequate funding for the Park--I needed to hand
him a package, and that package needed to be a couple of things: a package, a
plan with cost estimates and ideas in fairly firm shape for the visitor center.
And that, I think, is going to work. The Park Service did put it on the priority
funding list, and there is, the last I checked, $200,000 already in this year&#039;s
congressional appropriations bill as a line item, just eight months after it was
put on the Park Service priority list.

The other package he needed was for the larger Park, and that was what happened
in the week before I left. That was each partner saying, &quot;I will do this,&quot; and,
&quot;I will do this,&quot; and, &quot;I will do this,&quot; everybody agreeing that all the pieces
fit together and that they could move forward. That still needs to come into a
written shape, which will be the Park&#039;s General Management Plan, He might be
able to, for example--since he&#039;s in Education now--help find funding for the
restoration of the Maritime Center, and the Ruth Powers Center. But he needed,
in my opinion--, and I felt that way because if I were in his position that&#039;s
what I would need, to get some shape to this, get some reality, get some
critical mass, and get it pulled together into something that he can say, &quot;Here.
This is what we&#039;re going to do with Rosie.&quot; So that&#039;s what happened. The
agreements came together in that second week before I left, and then it will be
formalized in the General Management Plan.

CANDIDA SMITH: Was a lot of the uncertainty surrounding this project having to
do with it being a new model, or is there a question in various sources whether
these kinds of historically, perhaps constituent-driven, parks are really what
the National Park Service needs or wants, or the country needs?

HART: I don&#039;t think Rosie is constituent driven. You know, it started as a
simpler idea from Congressman Miller and was greatly expanded by the Park
Service. It was not driven by the city of Richmond, nor by Rosies. It really was
driven by the National Park Service, in its fuller form.

There are several issues about the Park that make it different and hard, and the
first one is simply the resources. The Ford Assembly Building is a quarter-mile
long, 500,000 square feet. The City spent sixteen million dollars just replacing
the broken glass and stabilizing the building from the Loma Prieta earthquake.
The buildings in Shipyard Number Three are in better shape, but they&#039;re equally
huge, and they&#039;re designed for a use that has never really found a good
adaptation in modern industrial society ever since World War II. So that&#039;s the
biggest problem, and that&#039;s why the Park Service said that they would not spend
money on Shipyard Number Three or the Red Oak Victory, or the Ford Assembly
Building. So that&#039;s the biggest problem.

It is also a challenge that it&#039;s relatively recent history. And that has several
subtle aspects. Some in the Park Service tend to get more excited about the
Victorian architecture in Charleston, South Carolina than the very simple,
functional, industrial architecture of World War II; it isn&#039;t as beautiful to
some, and that&#039;s a challenge. It certainly meets our requirements. Anything
that&#039;s more than fifty years old is considered historic, but it doesn&#039;t quite
carry the weight of structures that are older, I think, with some folks.

Another fundamental challenge of Rosie, which relates to the funding, is the
Park is kind of half way between a national park and a national heritage area.
And I was very conscious of that. I felt like I had one foot on two different
ice floes the whole time I was there, because the legislation demanded that the
Park be a national park and meet national park standards. That has ramifications
that go from here around the block three times, anywhere from meeting the
national environmental protection environmental requirements, air quality,
endangered species, I mean, the number of wonderful protective pieces of
legislation that apply to national parks all apply to Rosie. There aren&#039;t any
endangered species in Rosie, but I would have to look and say, &quot;That does not
apply to Rosie. We don&#039;t need to worry about that.&quot;

And yet it was envisioned that the National Park Service might not ever own
anything. So it is a fundamental contradiction, really, in our legal system to
say that all federal laws apply to privately-owned property. And that was the
essence of the screaming matches with the county, the sessions that had the
flavor of &quot;who the hell do you think you are telling the county what to do?
You&#039;re the federal government. You don&#039;t tell us what to do. That was the
fundamental contradiction there. And actually, most of the property is not
privately owned. It&#039;s owned by the county or the city or the state, and the
federal government is not allowed by our Constitution to tell any of those
people what to do.

So I always had that contradiction. And the folks in the county were dead right.
I mean, I just sat there and listened to them because I knew they were right.
And all I could say was, &quot;I&#039;m not telling you what to do. I&#039;m telling you that
the federal government deems this nationally significant, and I hope we can work
together to figure out some resolution here. But I know I cannot tell you what
to do.&quot; Well, that&#039;s not quite true. Under the preservation laws, the national
preservation laws, you can keep a building from being demolished. You can
prevent a destruction, but you can&#039;t make anything happen.

There is also a deeply entrenched resistance in the Park Service against
spending any Park Service funding on structures it does not own. So we were
prevented from owning by the legislation and prevented from funding by the
culture. So really the Park was rather more like a heritage area, which was the
job I had before I went out to do Rosie, where the federal government gives a
substantial amount of money to the management agencies, but the Park Service
does not own any of the sites and structures. Several of those heritage areas
get a million dollars a year; Rosie was getting $114,000. The heritage areas
have great freedom in how they spend that money. They can restore buildings.
They can give it to some other nonprofit. They can run programs. They can do
interpretation. They can really do whatever they want, and they&#039;re not required
to meet all the federal regulations. That&#039;s a contradiction, and that&#039;s an
ongoing controversy. What standards do the national heritage areas have to meet
in order to display the arrowhead is the controversy with national heritage areas.

But I didn&#039;t have any freedom. I just was--by the legislation, everything in
Rosie had to meet the standards of the National Park Service, but I didn&#039;t get
the million dollars that they got. As I said, it was like one foot on two
different ice floes. I would think, especially in the first couple of years,
that Rosie might better have been a heritage area. But I never really believed
that. I think being a national park brings benefits that aren&#039;t available to a
national heritage area, and the benefits are the standards and what that means
to the American public.

But my position was very tenuous. Anybody anywhere along the line would have
been perfectly appropriate in saying, &quot;Get out of my office. You can&#039;t tell me
what to do.&quot; And that didn&#039;t happen only because I didn&#039;t tell anybody what to
do. I just listened to them and agreed with them, in terms of the limitations of
my ability, but then would say at the end, &quot;And this is a nationally significant
story that hasn&#039;t been told, and people are really excited about it, and I&#039;d
like to work with you to make it happen.&quot;

It will be a challenge for the future of the Park if anybody comes in there as
Superintendent or in any significant position, and tries to act like the
National Park Service can make this Park happen. The whole thing could fall
apart. Because it&#039;s very much dependent upon the partners wanting to make it
happen in their own way, and the Park Service working with them to try and
reassure that the way they want to do it will be comfortable with the way the
Park Service would like it done, so that it can continue on as a National Park.
And that will always be a very fine line for every Superintendent of the Park.
It was one of the times when my Master of Arts in Law was very important to my
tone and actions. I understood what they were yelling about, and respected their
wisdom and respected them.

CANDIDA SMITH: On your notes you also talk about Manzanar, people thinking of
Manzanar as a good model for Rosie. Could you explain what that means, in
general what the Manzanar model means, how that reflects National Park Service&#039;s
practices and standards, and then what that meant in the particulars of the
Rosie Park situation?

HART: Well, there are two threads in there, and one is typical of the whole
National Park Service and the relationship of Congress to the Park Service. And
that is that the Park Service comes up with some early plans. It may have been
initiated at the local level, it may have been initiated at the congressional
level, but the Park Service has to come up with some early planning, and a
concept to go to Congress for a legislative hearing. So the Park Service has to
be involved in the early stages. Congress passes a piece of legislation to
create every single park. There are anywhere from two to twelve pages of legal
direction creating every new national park.

Then the Park Service goes in and starts shaping it with more studies and then
the Park Service comes up with what they call a General Management Plan that
also meets the federal environmental compliance requirements. It involves
writing an environmental impact statement, so you&#039;ve got the EIS, the
Environmental Impact Statement, together in the same document with the
development plan, and that goes to Congress, sometimes for their information,
sometimes for their approval, depending on the authorizing legislation.

Congress wants to see that GMP before they appropriate significant development
money to the Park; usually the Park legislation includes a ceiling on
development funding that can be provided prior to the completion of the GMP,
generally $500,000. They want to know what the big, eventual picture is going to
be before they start funding visitor centers and parking lots and so forth.
That&#039;s one part that applied to Rosie, except that there was the expectation of
very little federal money going into Rosie, so there was a huge contradiction there.

The Manzanar role model expanded on that tradition of a GMP. It usually takes a
few years to get the GMP funded, and then it takes a few years to do the GMP,
and then you send it to Congress, and then you compete for development money.

But also, in the western region, it meant wait, as in eight to ten years, for
any significant operation funds. Operation funds pay for staff salaries, office
rent, supplies, programs, all the things that make an operating park.
Development funds are construction funds, for visitor centers, large structure
preservation, new roads, sewer systems, and so forth. The western region
believed that operating funds should also wait till after the GMP is finished
and approved, whereby the &quot;Manzanar model&quot;, and wait eight to ten years to have
any staff. So, they believed $114,000 to pay my salary and some modest
administrative costs was adequate for the Rosie Park, and I should wait the
eight years to have staff or rent office space or buy supplies. Perhaps thinking
since Rosie didn&#039;t own any structures, there was nothing to do.

There was also in the western region a strong culture of get in line and wait
your turn. Just because Rosie&#039;s a new Park doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s more important than
anything else we&#039;ve already agreed to fund. There is no need at Rosie that is
more important than anything already on that list.

That was frustrating to me because of the reality that the Rosies were dying. We
were losing the Park story on a daily basis as the Rosies aged and passed on.
And that the City of Richmond and the County of Contra Costa, and a couple of
private individuals owned the buildings in the Park. And they weren&#039;t going to
wait eight years for the Park Service to develop a plan, especially since we
weren&#039;t going to give them any money. And all of the structures were threatened
with demolition, or neglect. And that what we really needed was money to collect
the Rosie stories before the Rosies died, and money to have the staff to go meet
with the partners, to listen to them, to figure out what their needs were, what
their resources were, how they could match with the Park.

I tried to do all that on my own, by talking incessantly and meeting constantly,
but it would have helped if we had had planners on the staff, or cultural
resource people on the staff, or preservationists, and maybe even an architect
to actually work with the partners and support them, give them maps, give them
photographs, give them studies, develop cost estimates for their projects,
things the Park Service is very, very good at. But we didn&#039;t have any of those
resources. It was just me saying, &quot;Please, wouldn&#039;t you like to make a National
Park for us?&quot; [laughs]

CANDIDA SMITH: Well, I&#039;m sure every park has its questions. I mean, I&#039;m sure
with Manzanar there were people dying off as well, who had important stories to
tell in terms of the Japanese internment, so in a way what sounds like a rigid
set of guidelines is probably designed to protect the Park Service from being
yanked this way and that way in a politicizing process.

HART: That&#039;s very true, and that certainly seemed the region&#039;s position. When
you get to operating funds, breeding condors competes with law enforcement,
competes with collecting Rosie stories, competes with a dock got blown away in a
storm at Channel Islands and they can&#039;t dock their law-enforcement boat there
anymore. All those things compete against each other, and it is--I would be the
first to agree--nearly impossible to compare them because they&#039;re so different.
It was time that I thought was an issue that was important. There are things
that are time sensitive, and there are things that are not, and I thought the
dying of the Rosies and the potential loss of the structures in Richmond both
were compelling in terms of time, and I believed could have moved farther up the
line against things that were not so time sensitive.

CANDIDA SMITH: Could you talk a little bit about the charrette process and what--?

[Interview interruption.]

CANDIDA SMITH: I was asking about the charrette process. It seemed to be one of
the major tasks that you had to accomplish in your tenure. I suppose it was the
basis, the groundwork for the General Plan?

HART: Very much so, but even more fundamentally the property owners, even of the
properties in Richmond, did not have a tradition of talking to each other, and I
always had a problem having a meeting where I would try and bring the county
officials to talk with the city officials. It was a lack of tradition of doing
that, a lack of thinking it was necessary, and it was logistical. The county
officials lived and worked in East County for the most part, and for them to
drive forty minutes to go to a meeting was not what they were used to doing, and
it was not an easy thing for me to persuade them to do.

I decided very early on in my career that it was much more effective to engage
other people in working with the Park Service if it was fun or interesting or,
ideally, both. And ideally there&#039;d be good food and a beautiful spot, a place
they didn&#039;t get to go to very often, so the charrettes were always, insofar as
possible, in the Harbormaster&#039;s Building, with glass on two sides looking out
over the marina and steps and verandas all around. At break you could go out and
look at the water and the boats, and people loved going to that building.

Any meeting in Richmond was a challenge. If it was too big to fit into the
Harbormaster&#039;s Building it was a major challenge. Once we persuaded the private
owner of the temporarily empty QRS building to give us their building for one of
our big charrettes. So the place was always really important. And we&#039;d serve
good food. People could look forward to getting a lunch, and they wouldn&#039;t have
to traipse out and get their own food. And from the very first one people told
us they loved the charrettes. They really enjoyed getting together with people
they didn&#039;t usually get to work with, and spend a day or two in a gorgeous setting.

We put an enormous amount of energy into planning them and thinking them out so
they would be productive. They would pull out the inspiration of the
considerable brainpower that always showed up in the room. And people like Will
Travis, who have 150 things that they could go do on any particular day, would
be delighted to come to the charrettes, because he would get to work with people
he didn&#039;t get to see all the time.

Who doesn&#039;t like having their brains tickled and challenged, and the
satisfaction of coming up with a good idea? And we were always very careful to
record everything and also look like we were recording it, so you could see the
person who was writing the notes, or the teams would be writing their own notes
on pieces of paper that would be recorded and transcribed later on, so that
everybody who participated got to see how much we valued their contributions.
Every one we had became more successful than the one before, and more fun, and
more interesting. More people were willing to give all day on Friday and all day
on Saturday, was the way we usually did them.

It was a way of engaging the group in a way that I couldn&#039;t possibly do on my
own. It was one of the really important levels of our community involvement. It
was obviously not reaching into the grassroots, although we would include people
that would be considered grassroots in the charrettes. But it was very
fundamentally different from holding a big public meeting. But it was also
reaching a level of involvement way beyond those first twenty people that had
been involved when the Park first started. So every time we had one, we would
say, &quot;Wow, that really worked. That&#039;s the way we&#039;re going to do it again the
next time.&quot; They were fun for us, too. They were the highlight of the job for me.

CANDIDA SMITH: To what degree did they help resolve some of the planning, the
design proposals--

HART: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

CANDIDA SMITH: I remember the one I went to, there was a lot of discussion about
what kind of internal transportation system should there be.

HART: You may remind me which one that was, because we did have a number of
them. But I still remember vividly about twenty minutes of what might have been
the first one after I started, because Ray Murray had had, I think, three
charrettes before I came on as Superintendent. This one I remember as being over
in the Boathouse, because we only got the Boathouse once, and then they wouldn&#039;t
rent it again. So we had a big group of people from many different perspectives
that had never sat in the same room before. I believe that was the first one
under my Superintendency. We were still at the point where the Port Director was
saying quite intelligently and plausibly and logically that no public person was
ever going to set foot in the Port of Richmond. It had been closed for decades,
and it was his perfectly reasonable belief, from a perspective of liability,
that no one was ever going to come in there. And, of course, Historic Shipyard
Number Three was the Port of Richmond. So we were still at a point where the
city was saying that this Park will not happen beyond, perhaps a visitor center
somewhere else.

City Manager Isaiah Turner came, and he was quite a charismatic individual. I
think that was when his attention first really lit up on the Park, when he heard
all these people talking about possibilities. He saw aerial maps. He saw
diagrams. I think that was when the concept of a visitor in the Shipyard really
first came home to him, and he got very excited about it. He had to leave early,
and he left with a flourish of his coat, you know, his tails out behind him. But
he said &quot;I&#039;m going to make sure this happens.&quot; I&#039;m like, &quot;Okay, we&#039;ve made a lot
of progress today.&quot; We had a lot of aerial photographs, historic and current, up
on the walls, great big blowups so that you could actually see Shipyard Number
Three. Again, 90 percent of the people in the room had never been there because
it was closed to the public.

And Jay Mancini, who was actually a financial planner I&#039;d gotten to know when he
did some heavy lifting on the Presidio legislation when I was still in
Washington working on legislation, we&#039;d gotten to be good friends over about a
ten-hour working session of redoing all the financial projections for the
Presidio as the legislation evolved through the hearing process. Jay Mancini
came, gave up heaven knows what his billing rate would be per hour, but he came
for the two-day workshop, and he looked at all those photographs and maps and
diagrams, and he came over and whispered to me and said that there was a road
that went around the Shipyard, and that people didn&#039;t have to go through the
middle of the Shipyard. The Shipyard is like a light bulb, if you will, with a
narrow opening and then the facilities spread out. To drive through to the
historic part of the shipyard you would have to cross, at a ninety-degree angle,
all the cars and things being unloaded and the people unloading a ship. They
don&#039;t unload containers; they unload individual things, in Richmond. So there
was an inherent and obvious danger to everybody involved in having visitors come
in there. So Jay&#039;s idea was, &quot;Well, that&#039;s not necessary. Visitors could come
around on that road that goes around the shipyard.&quot;

He came over and whispered in my ear, and I said, &quot;You&#039;re absolutely right.&quot; And
then I watched him go around the room whispering in the ear of the Port
Director, the Redevelopment Director, all the people that were sitting in the
room, saying there was another solution. Then after he had everybody&#039;s
attention, he said it to the whole room. And no one disagreed. Of course. Solved
the problem. Well, that twenty minutes or so has now resulted in--it turned out
to be more complicated than that. The road that he was seeing on the aerial
photograph was a fire road at the time. It became a full-fledged street that
goes into a new housing development on the hill above the Shipyard, and we went
through a couple of years of that housing development saying that would not be a
public road. You cannot bring anybody, much less a few hundred thousand visitors
to the National Park through our new street, through the middle of our
development. So it went through many permutations, and there were a lot of
alternatives about exactly where the newly extended Bay Trail would go to get
around the Shipyard and open it up.

The Shipyard, of course, is totally flat. It&#039;s on fill land that Henry Kaiser
created to build his Shipyard, with this significant hill right behind it. In
the end, when this huge Korean car contract came to the city, the Port realized
that they had to provide access to a couple of businesses that are out on the
end of the Port, so they built a road on the flat part of the Port all the way
around the outside of the Port, just like Jay Mancini had proposed, except it
was on the flat, not up on the bluff. And by then there had been enough work and
traction and planning and funding; there&#039;s now also a twelve-foot right of way
for the Bay Trail. So you have your dedicated lanes for bicycle, walking, and so
forth, separated from the cars, then the Bay Trail, and then the new auto road.
That all opened up just about a year ago, so now the public can safely, easily,
happily drive all the way around the Port, down to the now publicly available
historic structures in the end of the shipyard, and appreciate a gorgeous view
of San Francisco Bay as they drive around the Port.

That all came out of that charrette, and Jay Mancini buzzing in the ears of all
the people that needed to hear it, who were all sitting and kind of--you know,
you&#039;d see them kind of relax as he talked, and they thought it was a good and
workable idea. It was one of the highlights of the planning. There were many
breakthroughs like that, but that was probably the single biggest one.

CANDIDA SMITH: The other big topic I wanted to discuss with you today was the
issue, in a sense, the historical issues, the interpretive issues, how you go
about nailing down the historical story that the Park is going to tell, what are
the different interests involved, what are the concerns that the National Park
Service had about the particulars of this Park, and what are the issues
surrounding, you know, the question of whether this is a women&#039;s history Park,
or does it speak to a broader set of issues.

HART: Well, there are several answers interwoven in there, and it&#039;s a
fascinating question. Whether or not it was a women&#039;s Park--I&#039;ll start with that
one first--was and continues to be a controversy in the Park Service. Ray Murray
is the Chief of Planning for the Park Service region now in Oakland, California,
and he did all the early planning. Ray deserves great credit for going over to
look at the memorial and saying we might have a national park here, with the
historic resources he was seeing.

He came up with the name of the Park, which is Rosie the Riveter/World War II
Home Front National Historical Park, but has vehemently insisted ever since that
study that this is not just about Rosies. And my position was, well, Rosie is
shorthand for everybody in the home front, that it is about all home front
stories, there&#039;s no question. Little boys collecting aluminum cans to be
recycled, the men who were 4 F and stayed home and did various things for the
war effort; it&#039;s about everybody&#039;s home front story.

I did have to work pretty hard to keep it from being a battlefront story Park.
You know, the Park Service is largely men to this day at the professional level,
and they loved talking about how many different kinds of tanks were made for
World War II, and how many of them, and how many ships, and where were they
made. They love talking about that stuff.

And I would say, &quot;That&#039;s not what this Park is about. It&#039;s important, in the
sense that the Rosies were building these ships, but how many ships and what
they looked like and how they evolved during the war is not what we&#039;re talking
about. We&#039;re talking about the social change that happened because of this.&quot; I
had to defend that over and over and over again including to the new little
union of Parks with World War II stories. But to me that issue was clear cut,
and I think that Rosie is on solid ground at this point.

The issue of promoting it as a women&#039;s park is still a hot-button issue. I
always maintain that it is a Park about everybody in the homeland, and it
focuses on Rosies, and that&#039;s not a contradiction. The Rosie story is the one
that is completely untold. The other home front stories are really relatively
household knowledge; they don&#039;t need the attention that the Rosie stories need.
The Rosies whose stories had never really been collected before--don&#039;t think
we&#039;ve talked about this before--they were purposefully, in Richmond at least,
and probably everyplace, they were divided from each other at work. They were
not allowed to go into other parts of the Shipyard. They were not allowed to
see--if they were working on rudders, they didn&#039;t get to find out how deckhouses
were made, for security reasons. You couldn&#039;t take a camera into work. You
couldn&#039;t take anything home with you, for security reasons. And they often said
they were so tired at the end of the day, they had no energy left to talk about
their work.

When their men came home from the battlefront, it was seemingly universal that
they did not talk about the war. They didn&#039;t want to think about it, and they
didn&#039;t want to burden their wives, girlfriends, sisters, daughters with stories
from the battlefront. So the women didn&#039;t talk about what they did. So they
never got to talk about what they did, and didn&#039;t put it in the context of
having changed the culture of America. They didn&#039;t see that. At least in my
experience meeting them, they did not see that until the Park Service came along
and said, &quot;You changed the face of America with what you did.&quot;

And the Rosies would seem to universally say, &quot;Well, I only did it for eighteen
months. It was just a little piece of my life. I was doing what everybody else
was doing,&quot; And we&#039;d say, &quot;Yes, and you changed this entire country. You proved
that women could do whatever they chose to do. You advanced the cause of equal
pay for equal work in that process.&quot; I describe it as, instead of the laws and
regulations that I was interpreting as Superintendent of the Women&#039;s Rights
Park, what the Rosies did was go toe to toe with their bosses.

There were six million Rosies and six million bosses, and you changed the
viewpoint of six million men, and you&#039;ve changed America, and it&#039;s just as
simple as that. It wasn&#039;t easy. It was very hard on the Rosies, but it&#039;s very
simple math. You&#039;ve changed America by winning over your boss, one by one, and
it doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re only there twelve months or two months. It doesn&#039;t
matter what you did. You won over your boss, and that changed us all. And the
Rosies are thrilled to hear that, and think that something they did that hugely
mattered to them--they remembered the camaraderie of their work groups; they
felt like they were doing something important to help win the war. So to me it
became more and more obvious that that was the emotional core of the park, and
everything else was important information that needed to be interpreted someday,
but the core of this was what Rosies changed in our society. And I would say the
same sorts of things to anybody who would raise the issue. But the issue never
really went away.

The Rosie the Riveter Trust, which was really formed by a group out of that
early twenty or so, included City Councilors Tom Butt and Mindell Penn, the
former Mayor, Rosemary Corbin, and Diane Hedler from Kaiser and County
Supervisor John Gioia. At one point--I don&#039;t know who even brought it up--but
they thought about changing their name to make it more generic. And Tom Butt, I
remember saying--of course he&#039;s a man--&quot;We&#039;ve got a name that anybody would die
for. Why would we change it? All we have to do is make it clear that we cover
other stories as well. Let&#039;s don&#039;t change our name. It&#039;s crazy.&quot; I don&#039;t
remember that anybody seriously proposed changing the name of the Park, but that
issue hasn&#039;t gone away, and it may never.

I envision the future visitor center, I hope it will be something like the
Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., where you immediately get immersed in
many, many different stories of the holocaust survivors, or non-survivors, as
that might be. I see being immersed in the stories of the Rosies. You know,
you&#039;re hearing and seeing the stories all around you of what the Rosies have
done. That&#039;s why I think this oral history project that you&#039;re doing is so
important, Richard Candida Smith, heading up the program at UC Berkeley. I think
it&#039;s absolutely the core of what our interpretation will be. I could not, no one
could make the Park be a women&#039;s park. I actually had that argument when I was
Superintendent at Women&#039;s Rights, and I said that the last thing we need is
reverse discrimination in any form whatsoever.

And I think it&#039;s deeply important to tell all the stories, but to focus on the
Rosie stories and have the amazing eighty-five-year-old Rosies who come to
Richmond, and they are already coming from all over the country, even though
there isn&#039;t a visitor center or very much to see yet. They should feel welcomed
and comfortable in the park. And welcome and comfort to an eighty-five-year-old
woman is really not generally what we have in mind in the Park Service when we
design a visitor center, anywhere from the size of the typeface on the exhibits
to how many seats are there, are there chairs or are there just benches. You
know, in a visitor center you often go in and there&#039;s kind of big steps with
carpet on them. You&#039;re supposed to perch on the floor and watch the movie. Well,
that&#039;s not the way it can be at Rosie. They need to be comfortable chairs.

But I doubt if that issue will ever really go away. The Park Service is still,
to a great extent, a male agency and a male ethos. You know, the cowboy ethos is
still pretty much alive and well, especially in the western region. [laughs]

CANDIDA SMITH: Politically, given the Department of the Interior or the National
Park Service, were there themes that you knew that were going to be touchy,
controversial in this Park, or are there themes that you just knew, even if some
people might find them interesting, you couldn&#039;t explore them?

HART: Well, the first two big lessons I learned--and Betty Soskin was my
educator in this early on. We had a public meeting. She came to it. She spoke a
little bit to the issue. I went to Betty&#039;s home to hear her story. She is
African American and worked in the alternate black union because they couldn&#039;t
join the union in the shipyard. I learned a great deal from Betty, and she said
to me that the Rosie story was not her story. It&#039;s not the African-American
story. I said, &quot;Well, it was, you know. You were a substantial percentage of the
people who worked in the Shipyard. Granted, you did not get the housing, the
child care. You did not get the perks that the white workers did, but you were
working there.&quot;

She then said it was not a story to be celebrated because it was a story of
prejudice, prejudice and mistreatment. So that was how I learned that there were
two very--there were more than two, but there were two very large categories,
positive experiences and not-positive experiences regarding working in Richmond.

I also learned when we got our offices in City Hall and were surrounded by a
couple of hundred city employees that they did not like the poster that was so
popular in the Park Service and so popular around the country, and is the
number-one seller in the Smithsonian Museums in Washington, DC, the &quot;We Can Do
It&quot; poster. It&#039;s a drawing of Rosie with the bandana on her head, and the blue
uniform, and she&#039;s holding up her hand saying, &quot;We can do it.&quot; Rosie was white
and didn&#039;t well represent the staff in City Hall.

I said, &quot;Oh. Okay.&quot; When we first moved into our offices we couldn&#039;t put
anything on the wall. Isaiah Turner was very strict about that. But some people
did love that we had lunchboxes, we had coffee cups, we had napkins, we had
everything you can imagine, little bobble-head dolls with the &quot;We Can Do It&quot;
image. So we put those away and started featuring different photographs of
particularly African-American women. A huge percentage of the workers in
Richmond were African American. There are plenty of photographs of women welders
and riveters, and we started also featuring different photographs that reflected
Asian heritage and Hispanic heritage, and men.

The photographs, for example, the formal photographs that we had of the
Shipyard--Henry Kaiser documented everything he did, God bless him. And the
dedication ceremonies, they would have bands. They would have movie stars. They
would have famous people, often wives of famous people, come and break the
bottle of champagne, and they were always white folks in those photographs. And
when you&#039;d see the managers of the various plants meeting with the military, all
the kinds of standard photographs that you would see, they were all white folks,
but that isn&#039;t who worked in the Shipyard. So it was a big learning experience
for all of us to become sensitive to all aspects of that story.

CANDIDA SMITH: In New Orleans I presume the museum is still closed, but there&#039;s
the World War II--the museum that&#039;s in New Orleans in the museum warehouse
district. I didn&#039;t go inside, but it&#039;s an enormous structure.

HART: And hugely popular. We had the Chief of Interpretation of that museum came
to one of our charrettes, and he had lots of really creative ideas. He came to
one of the later ones about the visitor center plans. His museum is popular and
well-visited beyond anyone&#039;s imagination when that idea was germinated. I did
not get the chance to go there, and I don&#039;t know how damaged it may have been by
Katrina, how damaged the exhibits or the building. I don&#039;t know, I&#039;ve not heard.
But I have heard they&#039;ve had a substantial, very fine Rosie exhibit and home
front exhibit that was also very popular.

One faction was skeptical that this story would fade away when the Rosies died,
that there wouldn&#039;t be any interest in it, to which I&#039;d say, &quot;It&#039;s a nationally
significant story. It&#039;s not relevant to just one group of people who happen to
be in it. And besides, look at the World War II museum in New Orleans. It has
been immensely popular, and it&#039;s not just veterans who are going in there.&quot;

In fact, we learned that with collecting the Rosie stories. It was as often the
children of the Rosies who would write in the stories about their mother or
their aunt, whoever, and who had inherited the artifacts and wanted to make sure
the artifacts went someplace where they&#039;d be preserved. I think in some respects
the children may have understood better the change to our society from the
Rosies than the Rosies themselves. So it&#039;s clearly a story with great interest
that will go on.

CANDIDA SMITH: Was there coordination between you two, the two museums, on the
degree to which the World War II story is being balanced between the two museums?

HART: No. One of my frustrations of being a one-person Park for two years, and
then being a two-person Park for the next two years--really, I wished we had the
staff, or that I had the time to coordinate better with several different groups.

I did get to meet with the folks that were carrying out the veterans of World
War II oral history project out of Washington, D.C. I did get to go in the
Library of Congress and meet with them a couple of times when I was in
Washington on other business, was very impressed with what they were doing. They
were collecting Rosie stories. They weren&#039;t particularly advertising that, but
when the stories came in they would accept them, and I would have liked to have
worked much more closely with them. But, you know, it takes time.

Rick Smith and I, the Chief of Interpretation, the other person in the Park,
dearly wanted to go to New Orleans and see their museum and talk to them and
find out how they came by their collections, and who was coming to see them, and
all those fascinating things that would foretell something about our visitor
center. But we never had time to get down there.

There was also a National Alliance of Rosies that&#039;s a wonderful group that I
would connect with periodically. I wanted to go to their national meetings. I
wanted to work with them more closely, but I just didn&#039;t have the time.

Audio file 6

HART: You&#039;re double-checking that I cover all the names on that list eventually?

CANDIDA SMITH: Yes, I am. I&#039;d like to move on to--I think it flows naturally out
of this--to maybe say a little bit about the bringing onboard of Rick Smith as
Chief of Interpretation, what his responsibilities were, and how all of this
comes together in the development of the primary interpretive themes, which I
think is an official language.

HART: Right. Very good, Richard. The Park budget went from $114,000 to $160,000
the first year of the Bush administration. The administration came in and said
there would be no increases anywhere, anyhow, for anything. John Reynolds was
Regional Director and said that just didn&#039;t cut it. We have a handful of parks
in dire straits, and Rosie&#039;s one of them. So he managed to get the budget up to
$160,000, which, by the time you add in benefits and a little bit of
administrative money, doesn&#039;t pay for two people. But nonetheless, I was working
on the papers, the job description, the recruiting, and all the paperwork that
goes with hiring a high-level administrative person, because I felt that we&#039;d
already gotten the $200,000 grant from the California Coastal Commission, and
there was nothing I could do with it.

Fortunately, Gary Hembree, with the city Redevelopment Authority said he&#039;d take
care of it. So the money was transferred to Gary, who did the contracting with
the Park Service to do all of the research studies, which is really the second
half of the question that you asked me before this one. I used almost all of
that California Coastal Conservancy money on studies that were urgently needed
to support the future development of the Park.

The grant funds went through Gary Hembree in the city to the HABS / HAER Unit of
the National Park Service, the Historic American Building Survey / Historic
American Engineering Record, which is a unit of the Park Service I am extremely
fond of and in great admiration of. They hire graduate students to do the
research, and some professionals. It depends on the topic. So all of that money
went through Rich O&#039;Connor in the HABS / HAER office in Washington, and that&#039;s
how we got the histories done. We got the history of Shipyard Number Three. We
got the history of the Ford Building, the history of the Kaiser Hospital, the
history of the child care centers, the history of the labor movement in the
shipyard, and the overview of all of those. All that got done out of that
California Coastal Conservancy grant in year one.

CANDIDA SMITH: Who were the historians who did the studies?

HART: Fred Quivik, who&#039;s an industrial archeologist, architectural historian, I
think, did a superb job with Shipyard Number Three and the Ford Building, and so
he was also hired to do the overview. He&#039;s a consultant who&#039;s been in that field
for years and years. Alicia Barber, who was a PhD student at University of
Texas, did the Kaiser Hospital and the child care centers. Let&#039;s see, who did
the hospital? Oh, Alicia did the hospital as well.

Atchison Village worker housing really got done by Tom Butt as part of the--he&#039;s
the principal of an architectural preservation firm. He did the National
Register nomination, or had that done, for the Rosie Trust. So he really got the
history of that done.

What we came to call Nystrom Village, which included the Maritime Child Care
Center, the Nystrom school, and the war worker housing that&#039;s now public
housing, and the very important remnant housing from the farming era of
Richmond, was done by Architectural Resources Group, architectural historians in
San Francisco.

There was a good deal of work done on the Maritime Center also by Charlie
Duncan, who worked for--I&#039;ll think of it in a minute--the other big
architectural historian firm in San Francisco.

The Red Oak Victory was really done as a nomination to the National Register by
a Park Service person, whose name I&#039;ll remember in a minute. It was done before
I got there. And the nomination for Shipyard Number Three, which included a lot
of the history--Fred Quivik&#039;s work was more comprehensive, but there was a
National Register nomination of Shipyard Number Three that had been done by the
city early on. I don&#039;t remember who did that. All of those were extremely
important, because very little was known about any of it.

Henry Kaiser did, as I mentioned, document his work with photographs,
professional photographs, which was extremely helpful. But given the nature of
what they were all doing, which was building a building while they designed the
building and while they designed the program, and then starting the program
while they were still building the building, that was true of everything, from
the child care centers to the hospital to the Shipyard. They didn&#039;t sit around
writing up what they were doing or why they did it, so all of those research
projects were delving into primary resources, and figuring out the very
fundamentals that had never been written down about those previously. And a
great loss of records, you know. After the war many buildings were torn down.
Offices were shut down, and whole boxes of records we know got tossed. So that&#039;s
how the history got done.

Then to get back to your current question, which was, again, remind me?

CANDIDA SMITH: The development of the primary interpretive themes for the park.

HART: Thank you. To my amazement, one of my projects became wrapping up all
these studies before I left, which was four years after we got the money. I
would not have thought it would have taken that long, but as I said, the
research turned out to be primary research in some pretty obscure places. There
was no one place you could go. Fortunately, there was the UC Berkeley library
with its incredible resources. And incredible resources in Richmond. And all
those studies did get finished just before I left.

CANDIDA SMITH: Have these studies been published?

HART: Yes. The GNP team, at my request, took that on, getting them on the
website for Rosie. That process was still underway when I left, but when you
next get to a computer, hopefully you can open up to the Rosie the Riveter Park
site within the National Park Service website, and pull up every one of those
studies, and as well the National Landmark Study, although I think--that&#039;s a
thread maybe I could tie together. That would probably show up in the planning
document section of the National Park Service website.

So I was pushing very hard to get this research done, and also some basic kind
of Park Service resource studies done, and working very hard on hiring a
high-level administrative person to support me in the efforts to pull in more
grants and be able to responsibly manage, and supervise the grants.

In the meantime, Rick Smith, who was then head of interpretation at Yosemite,
had requested a hardship transfer to the Bay Area because of a family health
issue. The Deputy Regional Director, at the time, Art Eck, came to me and
suggested a proposal. Our budget wouldn&#039;t cover him, but he could transfer Rick
Smith into Rosie, and he&#039;d be the Chief of Interpretation.

I read Rick&#039;s letter, and I read his résumé, and I thought, well, he&#039;ll have
to do the budget work, but I know he&#039;s not going to be doing the administrative
work, like getting reimbursed for travel. No matter how little money you have,
there&#039;s still a lot of processes and forms you have to fill out.

So Rick came up from Yosemite, and I said, &quot;You will have to do the budget work.
You know, you basically write grant applications for all the money, like we got
for the round two of interviews with UC Berkeley was based on a grant
application that was successful. So that&#039;ll be part of your job, and we&#039;ll
continue to farm out this other work to any assistant anywhere who will do it
for us.&quot; There were five or six people doing our administrative work for us. I
said, &quot;I think we can stumble around, still doing that. And you can be Chief of Interpretation.&quot;

Rick went up and toured the Park with me one whole day, and fell in love with
it. I well remembered taking a brilliant young planner around on the same tour,
maybe a month before then, because I was hoping he could be the head of our GMP
team at the time. And as I wrapped up the day with this young planner, who&#039;d
done the very impressive work with the Park Service, worked with the Forest
Service, really had done a wide range of work, I said, &quot;Well, I&#039;d really love it
if you would be the head of our planning team.&quot; And he sat there really quietly
for a minute, and he said, This park terrifies me. I couldn&#039;t work here.
[laughs] I said, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He said it was just overwhelming, that he
wouldn&#039;t know where to start, that he couldn&#039;t do it. I greatly appreciated his
honesty and his ability to evaluate his own abilities but it set me back a
couple of days. I thought, &quot;Well, what am I doing here?&quot;

Rick was the opposite. End of the day, Rick was so excited he didn&#039;t want to go
back to Yosemite. He didn&#039;t want to stop the tour. He just wanted to keep on
going. He loved the resources. He loved the story. He loved the Park. We hit it
off immediately. He has a sense of humor that I miss dearly. It kept both of us
going through a lot of hard times. And that was it. We started on the paperwork
to transfer him into the Park, and he moved his family up and went to work
immediately. He is such a trooper. He is just such a rock of strength and focus
and talent. His talent amazed me constantly.

Rick somehow or another found the time to write a self-driving auto tour, and I
couldn&#039;t even guess how he did it. We both were so consumed with stuff that we
had to do, the huge level of tending to the Park Service that you have to do,
writing reports and justifications, and going to meetings and going to
trainings, plus working with these partners, and working with the Rosie Trust,
and getting these projects done. But he somehow got the driving tour done. He
did that on his own.

He worked with a group of people from Richmond to do the exhibits in City Hall.
We had a small grant, so he had to be very creative. It was largely photographs
included in a really interesting piece of metalwork, and a collection of more
photographs on the wall. He got that done. He worked with another group of
people to get those beautiful interpretive elements along the Bay Trail. I never
came up with a word quite descriptive of how beautiful they are, but they&#039;re
like the essence of the prow of a ship. They are about twelve feet tall, and
there are eight of them now along the Bay Trail, telling the story of the Bay
Trail and the Park, all funded by the California Coastal Conservancy again, and
ABAG for the Bay Trail. There were metal boards with porcelain interpretive
panels on each of these magnificent sculptures. They&#039;re just gorgeous. They&#039;re
only about this deep, but the beautiful curve that goes up that makes you think
of not only ships, but vision and hope in the future, and all sorts of wonderful
positive things. And each of them had this fired porcelain interpretive panel on
it, carefully reflecting the range of different kinds of workers in the shipyard.

Those were installed and dedicated just about a year ago, October or November a
year ago, and an additional one of those will go into the Shipyard with some
more funding, including the Daughters of the American Revolution funding.
There&#039;ll be a place where you can drive your car, get out and read the story of
the Shipyard. The Park budget is so limited; only one person got added after
four years. There won&#039;t be staff over there for quite a while, but these
elements will tell you what happened in Shipyard Number Three.

Rick Smith also created a Power Point that we used millions of times at our
public meetings. He&#039;s now been promoted to Assistant Superintendent. When I
left, I think the region finally came to understand that you really can&#039;t have a
National Park without any administrative support. Perhaps they noticed that the
Regional Director&#039;s secretary was doing all our travel papers. Perhaps they got
annoyed by that. I don&#039;t know. [laughs] She liked doing it. She actually came
out and worked in the Park for about a month, was a wonderful person. Perhaps
that was what brought the issue home to region; I don&#039;t know.

When I retired Regional Director Jarvis combined three other Parks with Rosie
under the new Superintendent, Martha Lee, and so Rosie is now combined with, or
under the same supervision, as Eugene O&#039;Neill, the John Muir House, and the Port
Chicago site. So there is now administrative support, although they had
full-time jobs before this arrangement, but there is administrative support, and
maintenance and law enforcement available to the Park now. So Rick is now the
Assistant Superintendent, and the expectation is he will manage the other three
Parks, and Martha Lee will manage Rosie. There&#039;s a Chief of Interpretation under
him now, but Rick is still over interpretation.

CANDIDA SMITH: The Chief of Interpretation is different from the cultural
resources person?

HART: Oh, fundamentally. The Chief of Interpretation at Rosie in the next few
years will be focusing on developing the plans for the visitor center, and
coming up with some kind of interpretive program. We simply never had the money
to have any staff to give programs, but presumably there will be some sharing of
the staff coming over to Richmond from East Contra Costa and giving programs.

The cultural resource person, who is the new person just put on staff--I don&#039;t
think she&#039;s even started yet, and this is now November of 2005, October 2005,
and she has been just recently hired--as I envisioned that position she would be
the person who&#039;s on top of the artifacts and stories that are coming in, on top
of the oral histories that you&#039;re doing at UC Berkeley, on top of all--by on top
of I mean very much aware of, very informed about, fully comprehending all of
these things, all the research that was done on all the sites and the history,
and the national study--have a solid understanding of all of that, so that what
goes into the visitor center is substantive. It&#039;s very easy to spend a lot of
money with some really, really attractive exhibits that don&#039;t go very deep. And
this is a deep story.

So at Rosie it&#039;s, &quot;what&#039;s the instant understanding of the significance of
Rosie?&quot; Rick wrote those interpretive elements for the Park, and they&#039;re focused
on the social change, the social change in equal opportunity, the social change
of women&#039;s rights, the public acceptance of child care so that women could go to
work. Not that we&#039;re in anything like universal healthcare, but the
understanding that working Americans and Americans in general deserve and
benefit from healthcare, those changes that came out of the war, and the story
of the monumental mobilization of the country to create the resources that
allowed us to win the war.

When you go in the visitor center, you need to understand that big picture
almost instantly, and then you need the filling in of the richness of the story,
and that&#039;s where the Rosie stories become so critical. Because it was many, many
stories. You can say the big picture in a paragraph, but the real difference,
the difference between the African-American story, the Italian story, the
Japanese story, really comes from the individual stories.

So how do you connect that individual with the simple--not simple, but
simply-portrayed--overall context statement of why this is important? You don&#039;t
get that skill from interpretive exhibit designers. You don&#039;t get that skill
from model makers. You don&#039;t necessarily get it from historians. It takes a
special kind of person to determine This is significant. This will tell this
story. That&#039;s what the new cultural resource person--that&#039;s, in my opinion,
their primary job. Secondary job is to apply for a million grants within the
Park Service and outside the Park Service to fund all the projects that need to
be done, like continuing the oral history project that you&#039;re heading up.

CANDIDA SMITH: Are there themes that you would like, or that some people in the
community would like, to see explored which for a variety of reasons you
politically can&#039;t touch? I mean, would religion be a controversial subject, or
gay and lesbian participation in the home front experience, or fleeting romance,
sexuality? Where are the boundaries for what the Park can do without finding
itself in a landmine?

HART: I believe that for much of it you simply tell what are known to be--you
know, history&#039;s not that simple--I want to say &quot;what are known to be the facts.&quot;
I understand it&#039;s not that simple. But when it&#039;s personal stories, you know, you
can count on that person believed that to be true, and therefore that&#039;s valid history.

One of the very interesting things about the evolution of healthcare in the
Shipyard is the hospital--there were three hospitals really. Well, there were
kind of four. There were first aid stations all over the Shipyard. There was a
triage First Aid Station in the Shipyard. There was the Kaiser Hospital in
Richmond, and then there was the big hospital in Oakland, and the severity of
your injuries--and there were many injuries in the Shipyard, and more than a few
deaths--determined whether you got treated at the First Aid Station in Richmond
or in Oakland. As time went on they needed more beds for serious injuries, and
so they turned Richmond into a hospital rather than a--the Richmond hospital
became a real hospital with beds for overnight stays.

One of the expansions, one of the many expansions--I think it quadrupled in
size, basically, over four years--was a maternity ward, to everybody&#039;s
amazement. They somehow thought they&#039;d have women workers without having any
pregnancies, and it didn&#039;t work that way. [laughs] And the man who was head of
the hospital at the time, during the war, went on a tour of the Park and was
talking about this, and said they were all--I mean, nobody expected to have to
have maternity services, OB/GYN. They did also notice that the pregnancy rate
was considerably higher for the night shift, and particularly for those who were
working down in the hulls of the ships. There was a double hull in every ship,
[laughs] so there was a lot of privacy in the bottoms of the ships on the
nightshift, and guess what? A lot of babies came from there.

Well, that&#039;s simple fact. And it&#039;s interesting, and it&#039;s fascinating to think
that all these men doctors never thought they would need a maternity ward.
Whether it came from the midnight shift in the Shipyard or just from life in
general, you&#039;d think they would have predicted that need, but they didn&#039;t. But
they did meet it once they realized that there was a need. So that&#039;s a reality,
and there&#039;s no reason not to talk about it. It wouldn&#039;t be a featured story, probably.

But religion can be trickier. I don&#039;t know of anything during the war that would
be controversial. It&#039;s clear, and partly from your work, the Berkeley Oral
History Project, you&#039;ve emphasized how important it was that the churches sprang
up in storefronts and living rooms and wherever they could--again, 20,000 people
lived in Richmond in year one, and 120,000 in year four, so they had to build
all those buildings that people met in, lived in, worked in. It was the churches
that held the society together, to a great extent, established churches that
created spaces in Richmond, and churches that just sprang up, out of their own need.

I don&#039;t know of anything that&#039;s controversial about that. They did an enormous
and very necessary good in Richmond that wasn&#039;t being fulfilled any other way.
And certainly, when you have 100,000 new residents in a small community, you
would want some social order. You would want some cohesiveness, some meaning to
the way people were living, so that was all a good, as far as I know.

On the other hand, in this time today, in 2005 religion can be very
controversial, and how one interprets--I mean, I don&#039;t see any possibility of
skewing how many churches were built, or what denomination they were, or what
they did. I mean, that&#039;s simple information to document. What their beliefs were
and how they practiced them and what that meant could become controversial in
2005. It hasn&#039;t yet. There really isn&#039;t a public interpretive program at Rosie
yet, so there&#039;s nothing to become controversial. There are some pretty modest
exhibits in City Hall, and a self-drive auto tour, and a PowerPoint, but it&#039;s
not a program that&#039;s reaching thousands of people. But it could become controversial.

CANDIDA SMITH: Well, wouldn&#039;t that be a liberation? After all, the Park is
located in one of the ground zeros of the gay liberation, in terms of the Bay
Area, and even by World War II there was a definable homosexual presence in San
Francisco that the histories have been written about. Are you going to be able
to, in the same way that African Americans can look at what they&#039;re doing and
say, &quot;This is my story&quot;?; would gays and lesbians be able to come to the Park
and say, &quot;This is my story, too&quot;?

HART: I don&#039;t know the answer to that. I&#039;m not aware, based on any of the
research that we have so far, or my awareness of your histories, I&#039;m not aware
that that was an issue during the war. I don&#039;t know, for example, if anybody
cared when they were hiring, if there were questions asked. I really don&#039;t know
what that story was in the shipyard, and my focus is always on what is the
historical story.

As I was talking about religion, people can take their current perceptions of
our society and exercise them as they choose, but for me the question is, what
was happening during World War II? Was it an issue then, and what was the
issue? I mean, the fact that the African Americans in Shipyard Number Three
could not join the union is an extremely important story, and therefore they
created an alternate union. If it turns out--or if there&#039;s research I&#039;m not
aware of--but if it turns out that there was open discrimination against gay and
lesbian workers, and somehow that was worked through, or it was not, or somehow
or another it was an issue, then it&#039;s an important part of the story.

In terms of somebody today taking on the Park as symbolic of their efforts or
their desires or wishes, that certainly happens, but it&#039;s not--that would not be
part of the Park Service interpretive program. The Park Service interpretive
program would focus on what happened during World War II.

[interview interruption]

I&#039;ve heard about possible communist influence or participation or involvement in
the Henry Kaiser Shipyard, and I just was saying that I don&#039;t actually believe
I&#039;ve even read our labor study yet on Shipyard Number Three. It should be posted
on the website. You could take a look at it. I don&#039;t believe that question came
up in the history of the Shipyard. We have the two studies on Shipyard Number
Three. I don&#039;t believe that came up in either one.

CANDIDA SMITH: It would have varied from union to union. The Boilermakers
certainly would not have had much of any communist influence. The UAW was
strongly influenced by members of the Communist Party, but there was a division
in the union between the Reuther social democratic side and the--I forget the
name of the guy, but I think it&#039;s Frankenstein, who was more to the left. Both
would be considered on the left and probably socialistic by many standards. So
the UAW was this union where this might have, in fact, been an issue in the Ford
Assembly Building.

You know, it&#039;s hard for us to reconstruct that through oral histories because
the people who are around to be interviewed right now were, what, in their early
to mid-twenties generally, and may or may not have--I mean, typically they&#039;re
just not interested in that sort of thing. They weren&#039;t in a position,
generally, to be in leadership. That&#039;s one of the difficult things, is it&#039;s hard
to interview people who were in leadership capacities in any field of life
during World War II now.

HART: Well, I was just thinking, though, the person that--I know attempts have
been made to get to him, and I&#039;m trying to remember his name--that was one of
the managers of the Shipyard but has not agreed to be interviewed. But you did
interview--who&#039;s the gentleman that spends half the year in Argentina?

CANDIDA SMITH: Yes, we did interview him.

HART: Did this come up with him when you were talking to him?

CANDIDA SMITH: I&#039;d have to--

[interview interruption]

CANDIDA SMITH: I wonder if we might go down some of the names that you jotted
down in your notes as being important for the experience, which I don&#039;t recall
having come up in our five and a half hours so far, and see what you have to say
about them. The first name that&#039;s on your list is Patty.

HART: Patty Neubacher was in charge of money for the region. She was a proponent
of the Manzanar model for funding. She was unable to increase the funding for
Rosie for the four years I was Superintendent.

CANDIDA SMITH: And she worked for Ray Murray?

HART: No. She reported directly to Regional Director.

CANDIDA SMITH: You have discussed Ray Murray previously, but I wanted to clarify
something that you&#039;ve alluded to earlier today. I think you were saying that he
was the one who went out to do the site inspection when the bill was first being
proposed, and proposed a much larger park?

HART: Right.

CANDIDA SMITH: So in that sense the Park is his vision?

HART: Very much so, very much his early creation. The Park owes a great deal to
Ray Murray.

CANDIDA SMITH: So he saw the possibility of bringing together the Shipyard, the
Ford Assembly Building, and the various others. So was he then instrumental in
helping you push things forward, or getting on a faster track than the
organization might otherwise prefer?

HART: It&#039;s a complicated story. I have great admiration for Ray. He&#039;s been in
that position for many, many, many years, and accomplished miracles, often on
his own. He&#039;s a person that&#039;s in his office till midnight every night, at least.
His support varied over time. We worked closely together during my work editing
the study, and then while the legislation was being drafted. But I was not the
one he wanted to be Superintendent. When I traveled back that fall for two or
three weeks in 2000 he was, I will just say, not helpful. Somehow, right about
the time that we switched to that second GMP team captain, a year or so later,
he became very supportive again, personally and professionally, and really
helped out in ways that were tremendously helpful to me.

He wasn&#039;t able however to engender any action from the larger regional office to
better support the Park. That didn&#039;t happen.

CANDIDA SMITH: We should talk a little bit more about the third team captain.

HART: Stephan Nofield, the hero of the planning for this Park, just an amazing
young man, with a lot of experience. A lot of Park Service people come in and
work their entire career in the Park Service, and therefore have a very
Park-Service-centric view of the world. Stephan had done several different kinds
of jobs. He led whale-watching tours for a while, which gave him a direct
experience of working with the public on a visitor experience.

But most especially, he was a planner for the town of Provincetown; I can&#039;t
think of a more varied community than Provincetown, or a more vocal, or a more
agitated or involved community than Provincetown, Massachusetts. Stephan is the
kind of person that&#039;s sensitive to people. That&#039;s just his nature, and he&#039;s
inclusive with people, and he&#039;s got a very gentle way with people. And anybody
who&#039;d survive as a community planner in Provincetown would obviously learn a lot
there also. And he also learned how towns work, you know, what drives their
budget, what drives their priorities.

He was just right out there--they were in his face every day. He was brilliant.
He knew planning. He wrote very well. He spoke very well. Everything you&#039;d ever
want from a planner was Stephan Nofield, and he was the one who was able to
fully engage with the partners and the community when he came to town. They
loved working with him. It was fun working with Stephan. It was always fun. He
has a fascinating brain, and he gets tremendous credit for pulling our planning
together. He also brought on the GMP team Keri Cahill, another planner from the
Denver Service Center. She too was well experienced to work with the Rosie team.

Jesse Washington and Joe Green--Jesse was head of Parks and Recreation for the
city of Richmond, and Joe Green was the Librarian. When I first got to Richmond
and started meeting with Isaiah Turner--actually, this happened ever before I
got there, I think. Ray Murray, I think, requested that the city appoint people
who&#039;d have a responsibility for making sure the Park happened, and it turned out
to be Joe Green, the Librarian, and Jesse Washington, the head of Parks and
Recreation, and they were both very helpful in teaching me how the city worked,
and who was in charge of what, and how you got on the agenda for the City
Council. Jesse let us use his conference room for meetings, over and over for
months. We were in there at least once a week. They were both really helpful to
me in those early months.

Don Hardison was another name you mentioned, and Don was one of those people
that I could just count on for anything. He worked in Shipyard Number Three
during the war under Henry Kaiser. He was an architect, and he designed--well,
in my terms he would take the hull, design it into pieces, taking into
consideration the flex and the shape and so forth, and figure out, how big does
this piece of metal have to be? What size and shape is this plate of metal going
to need to be to be riveted to the piece next to it, to end up with a ship? And
so he would design the molds that the women would use to cut the pieces that
they would rivet into the hull.

But because of his position he knew a great deal about the Shipyard, and who was
doing what, and, when somebody would tell us they were doing such and such in
this building, he could say, no, that was in the General Warehouse. There were
plates and silverware in there, not bombs. There were no bombs in the shipyard.
That&#039;s not why that building looks like that. And he was just incredibly helpful
to me personally, he and his wife Betty.

Don was also very much involved in the restoration of the Red Oak Victory, and
because of his professional expertise was leaned on for any number of things.
When the Red Oak Victory was thinking of docking alongside the Ford building,
they turned to Don to design--there&#039;s no dock there now--a dock that would work
for the Red Oak Victory and for the visitors getting on the ship, and come up
with a cost estimate at the point when they were trying to raise money to do
that. So people depended on him for all sorts of things. He did drawings of the
Red Oak Victory so that we knew what it actually looked like, and the size of
the rooms and so forth. He was just a saint of a man in terms of helpfulness.

One of the names you mentioned was Donna Graves. She is a consultant in arts and
culture. She was helpful in orienting us to the community and the issues. She
was actually on the staff of the Redevelopment Authority when I started. She was
instrumental in developing the Rosie the Riveter Memorial landscape sculpture.
She was on the committee that did the exhibits in City Hall, and she was very
instrumental in the interpretive elements, the prows of a ship, those elements
that are along the Bay Trail. So she was very helpful to getting the Park off
the ground.

CANDIDA SMITH: What are the perspectives that each of these people brought,
their personal perspectives of what the Park should do and shouldn&#039;t do? How did
what each of them brought help you synthesize a broader vision for the Park?

HART: The notion that was in my head when I got to Richmond came from the study,
which was reflected in the legislation, so that&#039;s what I thought the Park would
look like. I learned from all of them, particularly Tom and Gary, and Donna,
before I began to know other people in the community, they taught me what
Richmond was about, and how it worked, and what they thought, and what they
might want, and what interested them. As my contacts spread out in the community
then I would get it firsthand from the various people I was listening to. But
they were invaluable in orienting me to Richmond so that I didn&#039;t make any huge
mistakes when I first got there, and offend people.

In terms of how each of them affected the way the Park evolved, I would guess if
we had another thirty hours of tape maybe we could go into that [laughs],
because it was so incremental and so broad. I mean, there were the huge
breakthroughs like Jay Mancini with his idea of going around the Port rather
than going through it. Was there another breakthrough like that? Everybody that
I worked with--that was the beauty of the job and that was the exhaustion of the
job, I was working with--I think my closest circle was probably seventy-five
people by the time I left, that I talked to constantly, and I listened to every
one of them.

Howard Levitt, who did wonderful things in the months he was there, was the
Interim Superintendent after I retired. In our transition, he asked for my
advice. I said, &quot;It&#039;s very simple. Listen, listen, listen. Listen and listen. At
the very end of the meeting, say what you think.&quot; That was the way I did
everything about that Park, because it was more theirs than it was the Park
Service&#039;s, and it had to be theirs, and the only way for that to work was to
find out what they wanted and what they thought. So to go back through what each
of them contributed would be a huge project, and I am so grateful to you for
taping my talking about it, because I can at least get the names out there, and
give people credit for making all this happen. But that&#039;s a whole book, to talk
about what they individually contributed.

CANDIDA SMITH: We should talk about your decision to retire when you did, what
were the factors involved in that and what you felt the future of the Park was
likely to be, what direction had been set that your successor will be developing further.

HART: Well, the simplest part of that decision was my health. I had been
delivering a letter in Point Richmond that first summer in about mid-July. I&#039;d
been in town about six months. I was stopped at a stop sign in Point Richmond,
and a very elderly gentleman in a very large car rolled into the back of my car.
I didn&#039;t think it was much of a deal at the time. There wasn&#039;t any observable
damage to my car. I took his name and drove back to my office.

And I talked to my boss about it a couple of days later, but I didn&#039;t--it was
one of those injuries that just got worse and worse and worse over time. It was
a lower back wrenching, which I felt very clearly at the time. I just didn&#039;t
realize that I&#039;d still be living with it five years later. By a month or two
later I was in constant pain. At that point I was going to the chiropractor
every week, acupuncture every week, and massage every week, and I was still in a
lot of pain all the time. I found an office chair that was really comfortable
for my back. It was made out of bungee cords, and I think that really is one of
the reasons why I so easily slid into a habit of working very late in the office
every night, because that chair was--the only thing that was as comfortable as
that chair was my bed at home.

I was in constant pain. One of the things that I just dreaded was the VIP tours,
and I used to beg the developers, whichever of the three developers was in
charge of the Ford building, to open an entrance down by the Craneway where our
visitor center would be, but it was always at the far end of the building where
the security gate was, and I&#039;d have to walk a quarter mile on the concrete in
the Ford building to get down to the Craneway. Some days it was just agony, and
then I&#039;d have to walk back again, and in between I&#039;d have to stand down there
and talk to people. It was cold and windy inside the building. It was always wet
in there, and I would just be in agony on a lot of those VIP tours. I came to
dread the group tours. We had six or seven groups come down from the State
Library in their vans. For me to sit in a van and tell the driver where to go,
and keep turning back to talk to people behind me was just excruciating.

That went on for four years, plus working in the office till 9:00 pm many
nights, and under tremendous pressure all the time, especially once the Ford
project started. They&#039;d say they were going to send a television PSA, and I&#039;d
have two hours to review it. And we&#039;d all be sitting around trying to pull the
PSA up on our poor little computer system, that was a distant cousin of the
computer system in Oakland, and try and give them the turnaround they demanded.
It was relentless pressure of one deadline after another, all with extremely
limited resources.

And the people that were helping me, the chiropractor, the acupuncturist, said
they were keeping me going but they weren&#039;t healing me. They weren&#039;t even
keeping up with the kind of pressure I was under. And particularly the
acupuncturist I was going to, who was very much a spiritual advisor also, said
that my body was talking to me, trying to tell me that it can&#039;t do what I was
making it do, and if I didn&#039;t listen to it, it was going to get worse. I would
go out of there on a gurney. I ignored him for a full year. I think the turning
point was the Ford project, of being under such unrelenting pressure for months
on end. I finally decided to listen to him.

We were getting a hundred phone calls a day, and I&#039;d sit there, and I&#039;d hear
these phones ringing, and I&#039;d know we&#039;ve got two people on the staff here; how
are we going to get through this? We had a backlog of 2,500 messages that had
been left on our phones and never been answered, and someone had complained to
Ford that we weren&#039;t answering their phone call. The message came down, get rid
of the backlog. We had two weeks. They&#039;d give us $15,000. We had two weeks to
get rid of that backlog.

And I&#039;m like, &quot;We&#039;ve got three people here. Are you crazy?&quot; Just because you&#039;ve
got forty million people working for you, can&#039;t you imagine what&#039;s going on at
this end of the telephone? So we organized two phone-a-thons. We had the public
come into the office of the affiliation of county unions. They gave us their
phone bank, and the phone company mobilized their employees, and we put out an
ad for volunteers. The volunteers answered 1200 phone messages in two days, and
then we had a phone-a-thon over at Golden Gate National Park the next week, and
Golden Gate employees answered the other 1200 messages.

But it was more than I could take at sixty-two. I think it&#039;s as simple as that.
I started thinking maybe I really did need to retire, because I didn&#039;t see any
relief coming. I didn&#039;t see any money coming. I didn&#039;t see any more staff
coming. Ford&#039;s finances had fallen into a hole with their problems with the
rollovers and the tires, and they had set in motion this enormous project, and
had no resources to help us with the follow-up.

So I began to think more and more about my own health, and then started to
think, &quot;Well, if I were to leave, what would I be comfortable with? Where would
I want this Park to be so that I could feel free to leave?&quot; I looked at that and
what plateaus the Park might get to that would be stable places, I began to
think that my leaving could be helpful because the regional office in Oakland of
the Park Service, and a lot of the people in the community, knew that I was
holding a lot of stuff together. I was the centerpiece of the communication, the
center of the circle of communication, and if I left there were certain things
that were definitely going to be hard to keep going. So it took on a different
meaning to me. I thought, well, this could be a very positive thing, not just
for my health but for the Park.

Audio file 7

HART: So the one person I started talking to was Stephan Nofield, our head of
our GMP planning, and I said, &quot;I will not bail out on you. Unless we can figure
out a way that this is positive, I won&#039;t leave now.&quot; And Stephan was wonderful.
He was personally supportive and very creative and helpful, and we&#039;d be on the
phone for an hour and a half at a time, once or twice a week in the beginning.
We both quickly came to the conclusion that what was needed was not the Park
Service. The Park Service was going to have to catch up, at that point, with
what was going on in Richmond. What was needed was for each of the property
owners to get clear about what they were willing to do with their own property,
what was their vision, commitment to making it happen--obviously the money was a
huge question, but commit to having it happen when the money could be
secured--and to have all these property owners come in and share their plans
with each other so that the group of them could finally start working together.

They would be in charrettes together, but that was brainstorming. They weren&#039;t
committing to anything in those charrettes. So this would be
personal-professional commitment to make the Park happen. And then we worked
backwards. Well, we worked backwards from Stephan&#039;s schedule, because he had
many projects to work on. So we took his schedule, we took what I knew of the
schedule in Richmond, and we said, &quot;Okay. We think it would take this many
meetings and this much process, and this much discussion, and we need to get out
the first big newsletter. Then we need to--.&quot; You know, we just laid out what it
would take, in our best judgment, to get to this joint commitment.

I had in my mind the idea of leaving the end of January, although I was flexible
about it. So we worked backwards from that and decided that that actually was a
good time and laid out this very ambitious schedule of meetings and the
preparation for the meetings and all that, which fit in with what we were doing,
and it actually fit in with his schedule. We both knew we had this very strong
desire to have this personal commitment from the Park property owners.

Before that final workshop, the team came out and met individually with the
property owners, and then on a Friday all the property owners came together and
shared their plans. That was the week before--by this time in November I decided
I definitely would retire, and I announced it and announced it as February 3, I
think it was. So that big week of meetings was the second week before I left,
and it worked.

I think part of the reason it worked was that people were very shocked when I
said I was leaving. Apparently, even in this state of weakened health at the
time, people didn&#039;t think I looked like I was sixty-two at the time. They
thought I was younger than sixty-two, it was like, they just thought it was
going to be forever till I retired, and I&#039;m like, &quot;No. No, I&#039;m not going to die
with my boots on.&quot; So it was a great shock to people.

I called every one of those major partners. It was over seventy phone calls. A
few of them were messages, but mostly they were conversations, and the message
was always, &quot;We&#039;re heading toward this agreement, this pact of what each
property owner is going to do, and it&#039;s up to you to make this happen. The Park
Service has not showed up with money. It&#039;s not showed up with staff. It&#039;s not
showed up with much of anything. I can&#039;t promise you it ever will. You need to
make it happen.&quot; I wasn&#039;t necessarily that blunt with everybody I talked to, but
that was my message. &quot;It&#039;s your turn. You have to make this happen, and you have
to get out, knowingly, in front of the Park Service, and get the Park Service to
respond and get the visitor center built at least,&quot; which is the one piece it&#039;s
comfortable with.

And I&#039;d have to say that worked. It scared people that I was leaving. It shocked
them, and it scared them, and the one City Councilwoman, Maria Viramontes, said
to me what I really hoped people were thinking. She said, and I quote, &quot;I&#039;m
stunned. I&#039;m shocked. I&#039;m devastated. I never had to worry about the Park when
you were there.&quot; Remembering this is making me cry. &quot;And now I have to worry
about it. Now I have to make it happen.&quot; I&#039;m like, &quot;You got it, Maria. You got
it. That is the message. I can&#039;t make this Park happen anymore. It&#039;s got to be
you all.&quot;

The other huge event that I wanted before I retired was the Park Service
commitment to building the visitor center. [Takes deep breath.]

[interview interruption]

CANDIDA SMITH: Stopped briefly.

HART: I was overcome with emotion, thinking about those four years and the
decision to wrap up my part of it, and saying off camera that all four years
were emotional for me. They varied, but it was always difficult. That first year
it was, what did I do to myself, and how can I get back to the East Coast? And
the second into the third year was, why am I doing this? If nobody else cares
about this, really, I mean, they think it&#039;s interesting and new and different,
but they&#039;re not committed to it, why am I doing this? And maybe I shouldn&#039;t be
doing it. And if Richmond doesn&#039;t want this, I shouldn&#039;t be doing this.

And then the later phases were just being overwhelmed with the work,
particularly when the Ford project came through, just overwhelmed with
impossible deadlines that just never let up for ten months. Once we had about
5,000 phone calls, 5,000 contacts, and realized how important this was, we went
to the Hill in Washington to tell various people what was going on, make sure
they knew the kind of response we were getting. And Congressman Miller&#039;s staff
person said, &quot;Why don&#039;t we do a Congressional Resolution honoring their work?&quot; I
was so excited about that idea. Amelia Jenkins, she left shortly after that. The
idea just ignited people on the Hill. Many staffers are women, and they got so
excited about the idea.

So then we decided to have a big reception on the Hill in May to celebrate the
Resolution, and bring some Rosies from around the country to the celebration. So
then we&#039;d created a mountain for ourselves to climb. We had to get this
Resolution passed by May, which we didn&#039;t quite pull off. It was well underway
and the wording was written. I got to write it. That was one of the great
highlights of that job. It got edited, of course, but I did get to write it.

So we created a train wreck for ourselves and had to just work like crazy people
to get the Resolution far enough along to be presentable for the reception. The
reception was incredible, and then five Rosies got invited to the White House
breakfast with the President on Memorial Day. It was ninety-five veterans and
five Rosies, but every other year it had been a hundred veterans and no Rosies.
So that pressure was just relentless for months and months.

But I digress. The other piece that I wanted so badly to happen, either while I
was there or because I had left--I wanted the Park Service to commit to actually
funding and building the visitor center in the Ford building, which we&#039;d talked
around and around for five years. And in fairness, three developers had come and
gone. So we kept starting over with our plans, and starting over with our
relationship, and starting over with our negotiations every time.

But this time it seemed solid, and it was solid. So Rick and I developed a PR
program, basically, aimed at the region, and we did a mind map one day. It made
it fun, you know. I was using about six different colors, and it went anywhere
from Rick taking Patty to lunch to making sure that the beautiful, very
impressive architectural drawings for the Ford building got down to the regional
office. It was all about impressing them that it was real, that there was a lot
of work completed, that our relationship with this developer was solid, that
this developer was going to make it happen, that it wasn&#039;t a gamble to put it on
the funding list.

We set up an advisory group in the region, and collected all their input and
their support. It was a campaign. The priority-setting meeting was the week
after I retired, and I was gambling that there would also be some of the same
reaction: Oh, my god. Now we&#039;re going to have to do something. Judy&#039;s leaving.
And it worked. They not only put it on the funding list, but they actually
bumped it ahead of somebody else, the unheard of. [laughs] And last I heard
there&#039;s actually $200,000 in the federal Appropriations Bill this year to start
the planning. Now, that&#039;s not going to go very far. It&#039;s a five million dollar
project. But once you get money, then you say, &quot;We have a project ongoing. We
need to keep it going.&quot; You know, you&#039;re not just in line. You&#039;re actually
getting money, and there&#039;s a lot of momentum to finishing projects that got
started, so having a started project was desperately important. So now there&#039;s a
started project on the visitor center.

So the two big things that I wanted both happened, with enormous gratitude to
Stephan Nofield for really pushing through all those pieces that we plotted out
to get the partner commitments that would become the General Management Plan,
and to Rick Smith and Elizabeth Tucker for plotting out all these pieces to get
the region to come around and say yes to the visitor center, and then completing
all those tasks. It was a lot of work. I think there were three or four formal
meetings and presentations in the region, each of which was like a
mini-charrette. I wasn&#039;t as complicated at the big ones we did, but they were a
lot of work. And it worked; the visitor center finally got funding.

So the first filming that you did--I checked my planner; that was on a Wednesday
morning. I had officially retired on the Thursday before. The retirement party
was the Wednesday before. I spent all day Friday working with the new Interim
Superintendent, and all day Saturday, Sunday, and Monday packing up my office. I
was there till two o&#039;clock in the morning, because it wasn&#039;t just Rosie; it was
my whole thirty-year career that I was packing up.

Then a couple of very dear friends came and helped me pack my home, because the
moving truck was coming Thursday morning at eight o&#039;clock, the next day after
you filmed that first part of this, and when I looked at it I thought I looked
as tired as I felt. [laughs] And I was really glad you did it then, because you
caught me in the middle of just an overwhelming amount of emotion that--it&#039;s
making me cry again--that the work got done, and the appreciation that got
expressed was just--clearly, people had gotten to the point where they cared
about the Park, and they cared about me, and they were sorry that I was leaving,
because they had grown to care about me. But more important, they&#039;d grown to
care about the Park. And that hadn&#039;t been true when I started and they all
thought I was crazy. Literally. So I was overwhelmed then, and I&#039;m overwhelmed now.

CANDIDA SMITH: You had an additional issue that you wanted to discuss about the
Ford project, which does seem like it was a major turning, in some ways one of
the major turning points for the whole Park.

HART: It definitely was. It proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was
enormous interest in this story. I mean, saying it was a nationally significant
story, which the Park Service said from day one, is a little dry. But there
clearly was this enormous outpouring of interest and support and commitment and
love of the Park.

I got such moving letters after I retired. It had always bothered me that the
people who submitted their stories and artifacts did not get a personal letter
acknowledging it. We had our whole process of, you know, assigning numbers and
taking it into the collection, and they&#039;d eventually get a formal piece of paper
that has numbers on it, but I wanted to write a thank-you letter. So when I
retired, dear Elizabeth produced 2,200 thank you letters for me to sign. I said,
&quot;We really appreciate your story. We really appreciate the fact that you&#039;ve sent
this artifact. It&#039;ll become part of the Park. Thank you, and I want to let you
know I&#039;m retiring.&quot; I got the most beautiful cards back from some of those
ladies, thanking me for the work I&#039;d done, and wishing me well in retirement. It
was quite moving.

But it&#039;s important to talk more about that project, because it was huge. It was
at least three years in the making. We talked about it with Jody Keating, who
was the program officer at the National Park Foundation, the national nonprofit
that works with the Park Service at the Washington level, and this wonderful
woman, Jackie Lowey. Jackie had been a Deputy Director of the Park Service, and
was an amazingly wise and wonderful, spirited person then working as a
consultant. So Jody and Jackie and I had been scheming for about three years how
to connect with the Ford Motor Company, which had a contract with the National
Park Foundation to support the parks. And it was, after all, the Ford Assembly
Building where the visitor center was going. Ford was a big part of the story in Richmond.

And so finally the project was Ford would use their advertising budget to
advertise Ford, and also call for Rosie stories. I think they gave us $50,000
between the Park Foundation and Ford, and we hired two amazing women. Michele
Seville was a long-time Richmond resident, very involved in the arts community,
and Elizabeth Tucker, who had formerly worked for the Park Service in Yosemite,
so Rick Smith knew her. And she had moved up to the Bay Area. So we put Michele
and Elizabeth on the payroll, and they did such heroic work.

The idea got formulated in August. By September Ford had decided--because Ford
made all the decisions--Ford decided they wanted the big press conference to be
on Veterans Day. So we had to gear up for this huge ceremony in Richmond in six
weeks. Elizabeth and Michele and Rick and I just worked like crazy people. No,
we worked like very hard-working, intelligent people, and we worked with their
advertising agency folks, who were the crazy ones. [laughs] It was a very
exciting time.

We had a fabulous press conference. We had Rosies from all around the country.
Ford had flown them in from Kansas, Texas, Maryland, and California, and we
invited about twenty other Rosies from the Richmond area. It was to be a press
conference. Well, somebody heard about it, and it got announced on the radio
that morning. We got there, and our private press conference had a crowd of
about three hundred people, which made for a very exciting morning all the way
around. There was a mad scramble to assemble more hard hats for the unexpected
visitors. But everybody loved it.

The Ford building looked fabulous. They had thousands of dollars worth of red,
white, and blue balloons all over the building, which did warm it up a lot. It
was a cold, windy, and drippy day like it always was in November, and rain water
had come in the broken windows and was standing on the floor but the balloons
made it look very festive, along with tables and chairs and flowers and food.
Ford was working with their advertising company to put this on and they did a
fabulous job.

And then Ford got really excited after that press conference. They were
interested before, but then the response starting pouring in. Ford&#039;s focus was
their website, and they wanted Rosies to enter their stories on the Ford
website, and we did get thousands that way, but they were primarily the children
of Rosies. They could go onto the Ford website, the Park Service website, or
they could write us, or they could call us, and that all went out in the press
information. Rosies mostly got on their phones and called the Park office.

And, of course, from November 11 we headed into the holiday season, and the Ford
advertising company had put together a public service announcement that was so
fetching, is the word that comes to mind. It had the Rosie the Riveter song, and
it had historic, moving footage of Rosies working, and a very simple call at the
end with the Ford logo on it, and it said, &quot;Call this number if you have a Rosie story.&quot;

By the time we went through Christmas and New Years and everybody came back to
work, we were getting a hundred phone calls a day in our office, and the mail
was pouring in, and we still had Michele and Elizabeth, who were supposed to be
on the payroll for, like, another month. I called &quot;Help,&quot; and Ford sent a little
more money, the Park Foundation came up with a little more money, the Park
Service came up with a little bit more money. We ended up keeping Michele on
until June, and Elizabeth&#039;s still there. We were able to put her on the Park
payroll after the middle of the summer. And the two of them pulled in
volunteers. They were like huge magnets. We would typically have ten, twelve
people working back there all day long, answering the phones, and processing the
packages that would come in; they got some graduate students that actually had
training in that area.

We worked through the Resolution for Congress, and then the reception in May in
Washington with the Rosies, celebrating the Resolution. Then there was a press
conference the next day also in Washington with Sissy Spacek, that was really
more Ford talking about the Women in Military Museum in Arlington, Virginia, and
then the White House breakfast on Memorial Day.

And then the boxes started to come with the artifacts that were just amazing. It
was an incredible project, because it was such an outpouring of emotion, as well
as memories. And, of course, it&#039;s still going on. The artifacts are still coming
in. The stories are still coming in. Ford said they didn&#039;t have any more money.
They&#039;ve had severe financial troubles that were well known publicly, and they
really couldn&#039;t support the project anymore.

Thanks again to Stephanie Toothman, the cultural resources chief in the Seattle
office, the Park Service did come up with funding for things like boxes and
storage cabinets, and labels and white gloves, and plastic envelopes and
archival sleeves, and all those things you need to keep artifacts preserved, and
fortunately came up with a big metal cabinet that has pull-out drawers. Because
they are just in a back storage room, really, of Richmond City Hall, and Rosies
come from around the country, and they want to see the museum. They want to see
their donation. They want to see the exhibit. We show them the exhibits in the
City Hall lobby, which are pretty modest, but then we can take them back to the
workroom and pull out these shelves and show them their artifacts so they at
least can get to see them. They&#039;re hardly on display but, you know, it&#039;s the
beginning of just an amazing, amazing project.

I am very eagerly anticipating and have very high hopes for the staff. The new
Superintendent is Martha Lee, and she&#039;s just hired Lucy Lawless as a Cultural
Resource Specialist. Rick Smith is Assistant Superintendent, and Elizabeth
Tucker is now a full-fledged Ranger in the Park. They will be the core staff
that goes into planning the visitor center. I can hardly wait to see how these
artifacts and stories and oral histories somehow come together in this
magnificent kind of greenhouse space overlooking the bay in San Francisco, with
an eighty-foot ceiling, I think.

The general concept that we presented to the Park Service was a piece of a ship.
So the piece of the ship if it were life-sized would be sixty-feet high, and
somehow the artifacts and the stories suspended, attached to--you walk
into--somehow this is the centerpiece of that enormous space. I can hardly wait
to see it.

[Narrator addendum: The developer moved ahead with his plans for the Craneway
before the Park Service was ready to proceed with the planned visitor center.
The visitor center opened with temporary exhibits in 2012 in the Oil House
adjacent to the Ford building.]

And with great thanks to Ford. We could not possibly have collected those
stories on our own. There just is no way. My one hope is that somehow some
simpler plan for collecting Rosie stories could travel around the country, and I
hope you work on this, Richard. [laughs] That somehow women can--we&#039;ve done a
couple of these, you know. We sent out signs and said, &quot;Yes, the Park Service is
co-sponsoring this gathering of Rosies in the local library,&quot; and they sit down
and meet each other for the first time, probably, and write down their stories
and send the stories in to the Park. I know it&#039;s nothing like the four-hour
interviews that you conduct with people, and help them get back to their
memories. It&#039;s nothing like that, but I still would like to see something like
that happen.

I also wanted to talk about Time magazine, because they were one of the partners
in this National Park Foundation Project, Proud Partners was what they called
it. They, without any cost to the Park or the Park Service, put a five-page
advertorial in Time magazine. It featured Ford, but Ford&#039;s insignia was never
any bigger than the Park Service arrowhead or the National Park Foundation logo.
And it described the Park. It described Richmond. It talked about Rosies. It
talked about Ford&#039;s role, that they had Rosie because Rose Monroe was an
employee who became the star in the movie Rosie the Riveter. A beautiful piece
which they let us review and edit, and change what needed to be changed,
absolutely a gorgeous piece in full color.

That article ignited interest in Richmond in a way that would be hard to imagine
what could have been more effective, that they could see their community,
Richmond, which is often in the papers about its homicide rate and its other
social problems, to see Richmond featured in Time magazine. People just streamed
into my office the next day. I had the press coverage laminated, and by then
Isaiah Turner was gone, so we could hang up things on the wall, so I had this
full-page ad in USA Today of the call for stories, and the big pictures that
were in every paper hanging up on our cubicle walls, showing people the kind of
press coverage that they got for this Veterans Day press conference.

And we&#039;d taken apart the Time magazine and put it all over, and given copies to
each of the City Councilors, and the Mayor and the City Manager. They were just
overwhelmed that Richmond would be featured so beautifully in Time magazine, and
it probably did more to create that majority of interest in the City Council,
and that very deep commitment now with the Mayor and the City Manager. It did
more than any other thing we could possibly have done. It was the old &quot;come at
it sideways,&quot; you know? Who would think that Time magazine would be promoting Richmond?

CANDIDA SMITH: Do you know who the person was at Ford, or at Time magazine,
rather, who made that story happen?

HART: No, I don&#039;t. We never got to talk to anybody from Time.

The woman who was head of international marketing--I mean, she was the top
person for marketing for Ford--was involved in the project, and the woman who I
think might have been slightly higher but in a different track, who was head of,
like, operations around the world for Ford, were the--they were the top team
sent forward. They were the ones that came to the press conferences. There was a
wonderful woman, Robin Bishop, who was, I believe, in charge of the Office of
International Policy, just the most gracious, charming, intelligent, wonderful
person to work with, very calm and calming. She would personally negotiate all
the parts of Ford who were often in different places, and she would negotiate
with the advertising company, Hill and Knowlton. She would calm the waters and
negotiate all that.

Jackie Lowey and Robin Bishop were the two people who pulled it together and
kept everybody speaking to each other. Those conference phone calls were really
something else. [laughs] Extremely difficult at times, usually with the
advertising people. And as many as eight on the line at once. And whenever
Jackie called on her own I knew something was seriously amiss. I&#039;d known Jackie
for years and I just adore her. She&#039;d say she had to tell me this; she had to
tell me that. And I particularly remember the phone call about the backlog of
the 2500 messages. She said I had to clear it up in two weeks. I said, &quot;Jackie,
that&#039;s impossible.&quot; She said she knew I&#039;d figure out a way to do it. I&#039;m like,
&quot;Jackie!!&quot; She said I had to do it. They&#039;d given me $15,000. It&#039;s not much, she
said, but this whole project would fall apart if I didn&#039;t get rid of that
backlog in two weeks. I&#039;m like, &quot;We can&#039;t.&quot; &quot;You have to.&quot; &quot;We can&#039;t.&quot; &quot;You have
to.&quot; [laughs] And that&#039;s when we decided to do the phone-a-thons. That was the
only way we could think of to possibly deal with it. But she was amazing to work
with. And I&#039;m sure that Robin had a million conversations like that within her group.

CANDIDA SMITH: The thing that astonishes me in the whole story--I&#039;ve seen it
unfold, and as you&#039;ve narrated it--is the requirement for heroism on your part
and on the part of everyone involved. It seems like that last anecdote actually
does in many ways symbolize the whole thing. Either you&#039;re superwoman or nothing
will happen. It will all fall apart. Which, of course, explains why you would be
thinking about retiring. [Hart laughs] But I wonder to what degree this is an
anomaly, or to what degree this is something that is being built into different
aspects of American life that you would see. Is your story unique within the
National Park Service, the federal government?

HART: Well, you know, I appreciate your asking that. I appreciate the compliment
behind that. People do say about both Rosie and Women&#039;s Rights National
Historical Parks that they wouldn&#039;t have happened if I hadn&#039;t been there to make
them happen.

Many expressed their opinion that both Parks were impossible. But they weren&#039;t.
The word impossible means to me, just try another path.

I always have a vision, a dream, a picture of where I want to end up. If one
route is blocked, I just look for another, or create another. I begin with the
legislation creating the Park, and then create my personal vision, and inspire
others to join in making it happen then work to make the vision a reality. I
never doubt that the Park will happen. I never let up; some have said my middle
name is Perseverance.

The Rosie the Riveter Park presents special challenge to the Park Service. Its
success is dependent on the City of Richmond and Contra Costa County. The Park
Service will probably own no land or property there, and it needs to inform and
inspire and collaborate with others to do the work. The Park is part of an urban
community struggling with racial tension, poverty, and crime. All of the
historic structures were threatened with demolition, or neglect. The Rosies and
their stories were not known. The history of the story was not well known.

Most parks did not struggle with these issues, so there was a lack of experience
in the Park Service overcoming these issues. My experience and education before
I joined the National Park Service were important in facing the challenges. All
of my positions before the Park Service were embedded in controversy. I also had
worked in the most challenged of African-American neighborhoods in Boston during
the most challenging time after the assassinations of Martin Luther King and
Bobby Kennedy. I had spent most of my career working in urban areas, usually in
distressed areas. My BA degree from Cornell included English literature,
philosophy, and psychology. My Master of Arts degree was in Law.

I had a passion to create new and positive experiences for people, and a passion
for understanding the big picture of history. I wanted untold stories to be
told. It became my mission once I began with the Park Service.

It was my honor, privilege and joy to have been the Founding Superintendent of
Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park.

It is also my honor, privilege and joy to have been the Founding Superintendent
of Women&#039;s Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls, New York.

Conclusion by Judy Hart

On January 21, 2013, Judy Hart finished her review of the transcript of the
interview. Simultaneously, the President of the United States, Barack Obama,
included &quot;Seneca Falls&quot; in his inauguration speech and referred to the words in
the &quot;Declaration of Sentiments.&quot; That declaration, demanding women&#039;s right to
vote, in 1848, was publically announced in Seneca Falls, the location of the
National Park today. Visit both Parks!

Contributors to the Rosie the Riveter / World War II Home Front National
Historical Park: It took an army, but the following were especially dedicated to
the Park.

Rosie the Riveters and Wendy the Welders

The Park commemorates and interprets the work, as well as the challenges,
personal contributions and victories, of millions of women who went to work in
factories building the ships, planes, tanks, and trucks crucial to winning World
War II, and all Americans who contributed to the war effort on the home front.
They are the heroes of the Park!

United States Congressman George Miller was the spearhead for the legislation
creating the Park, and continued to support the Park along with John Lawrence,
his Chief of Staff.

Elected officials and staff of the City of Richmond are congratulated for their
history-making work and include Irma Anderson, Mayor; Leveron Bryant, Deputy
Mayor; Tom Butt, City Council; Donna Powers, first woman elected to City
Council; Isiah Turner, City Manager; Jay Corey, Deputy City Manager; Jim
Matzorkis, Port Director; Tom Mitchell, Redevelopment Head; Gary Hembree,
Redevelopment staff; Donna Graves, cultural consultant; Joe Green, Librarian;
Jesse Washington, Parks and Recreation head; Steve Duran, subsequent
Redevelopment head; and the four additional Interim City Managers in the fourth
year of Park development.

Contra Costa County officials were crucial to the success of the Park,
especially including County Supervisor John Gioia and Facilities Manager Al Prince.

The support of Will Travis, Executive Director of the San Francisco Bay
Conservation and Development Commission, made it possible to bring visitors into
historic Shipyard Number Three, which is also the active shipping port for Richmond.

Rosie the Riveter Trust was a very early partner supporting every initiative for
the Park, including the authorizing legislation creating the Park: Tom Butt,
President; John Gioia, County Supervisor; Rosemary Corbin, former Richmond
Mayor; and Diane Hedler, Kaiser Permanente.

Richmond Port Director Jim Matzorkis became a major supporter for bringing the
public into Historic Shipyard Number Three, his Port, and for preserving the
historic structures and setting.

The enormous challenge of restoring and bringing to new use the Ford Assembly
Building was supported by the work of Eddie Orton, developer #3, Ethan Silva and
Gerard Howland, developer #2, and Forest City, developer #1.

The Maritime Child Care Center was preserved, restored, and opened to the public
by the tireless efforts of Tom Butt, John Gioia and Al Prince.

The SS Red Oak Victory was rescued from her mothballed state and restored by the
endless devotion of Lois Boyle, President, Richmond History Museum; Don Harding,
shipyard supervisor during World War II; and an amazing Volunteer restoration crew.

The historic Richmond Whirley Crane was generously donated by owner Gary Levine,
and stabilized and moved to historic Shipyard Number Three with special thanks
to Mark Howe, volunteer manager for moving the Whirley Crane, and Tom Butt, and
the donation of the time of the enormous barge that moved the Whirley Crane down
the shipping canal and back into Shipyard Number Three.

Shelby Sampson gave special help with the Atchison Village war worker housing.

Special thanks go to the Northern California Muslim Association for their
kindness and care for the historic Kaiser Hospital, their new home.

Particular thanks go also to Consultant Larry Kennings, LAK Associates, for his
sensitive work protecting historic Shipyard Number Three when threatened by a
use which might have prevented visitor access.

The National Park Service was the basis of support for the entire project. The
following deserve particular recognition:

The Park&#039;s founding staff: Judy Hart, Park Superintendent; Rick Smith, Park
Chief of Interpretation; Elizabeth Tucker, Park Ranger; Michelle Seville, Park
Ranger; and a fleet of dedicated volunteers.

The Washington DC headquarters of the National Park Service: Deny Galvin, Deputy
Director; Kate Stevenson, Associate Director for Cultural Resources; Warren
Brown, Chief of Planning; Don Hellmann, Chief of Legislation; Rich O&#039;Connor,
HABS/HAER; and Nicholas Targ, Solicitor, Interior Department Solicitors Office,
Washington DC.

The Park Service regional office in San Francisco and Oakland: John Reynolds,
Regional Director; Ray Murray, Planning Chief; Stephanie Toothman, Chief of
Cultural Resources; Jon Jarvis, second Regional Director; Bill Walters, Deputy
Regional Director #1; Art Eck, subsequent Deputy Regional Director; George
Turnbull, Deputy Regional Director #3; and Patty Neubacher, Budget Chief.

Stephan Nofield, GMP Team Captain, created the partnership of owners in Richmond
who will make the Park, while he worked from the Park Service Denver office.

Brian O&#039;Neill, Superintendent, Golden Gate National Park, San Francisco, and
Howard Levitt gave heroic service to the Rosie Park.

Finally, tremendous gratitude is owed to the fleet of additional volunteers and
helpers who helped lift off of the Rosie the Riveter / World War II Home Front
National Historical Park, and especially, to the Rosies and Wendies and all
those whose devoted work on the home front helped win World War II. And changed
our history for all Americans.
