 Finchum Today is July 22, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Duncan, Oklahoma, to speak with John Shipman. This is part of our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life project so thank you for having us.  Shipman Thank you for coming.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Shipman I was born in Oklahoma City May 14, 1915.  Finchum In a hospital?  Shipman I don   t know.  Finchum At home?  Shipman I think. It probably was at home. Back then I think everybody was born  at home.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Shipman I have no idea, I was a foster child.  Finchum How old were you?  Shipman I think about four.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters, or do you know?  5  Shipman Yeah, I   m the oldest one. I had a younger sister and a younger brother,  but they passed away.  Finchum Biological? Were they adopted like you or were they really yours?  Shipman No, they  were mine . No, I didn   t have much of a family affair there.  Really the family that I remember was my instructor when I learned to  fly and about two or three other fellows that we lived together. I was  about fifteen so they were appointed as my guardian, because that was  my family. I didn   t know much   course I knew I wasn   t in the right  family when I was a foster child. I came back to see my mom once in a  while, you know. No, I didn   t really have much of a family.  Finchum Where did you go to school?  Shipman Well, mostly California.  Finchum How did you get there?  Shipman The foster family took me there. The foster family got me and then we  lived at Ardmore at the time. Then they   I don   t know how long I was  with them, not very long, and they moved to California.  Finchum Then how did you get back to Oklahoma?  Shipman I hitchhiked and rode the freight trains.  Finchum That must   ve been an experience.  Shipman Yeah, it was an experience alright.  Finchum How old were you when you did that?  Shipman About fourteen.  Finchum Pretty young.  Bishop That would   ve been during the Depression.  Shipman Yeah, well, and too that was about the time that Lindbergh kid was  snatched up. That was later, that was a later time, but even during the     that was during the Depression too. That   s the reason I rode the freight  trains, nobody   d pick you up.  Finchum Did you try to hitchhike?  6  Shipman Yeah, well I did pretty good hitchhiking, but then sometimes you went  for a long time without getting a ride. If a freight train came along you  jumped it, if you could. (Laughs)  Finchum What would you do for food?  Shipman Do without. I remember one time a freight train stopped out there in the  desert someplace, either Arizona or New Mexico. I was hungry and I  run up to this house and there was a Mexican lady. We couldn   t talk. I  mean she didn   t understand me, I didn   t understand her. I finally got  a   she had some stale old bread. She gave me a couple slices of stale  old bread. Boy  That was a good meal. (Laughter) I did pretty good. I  remember one time coming, when I was hitchhiking, I got stuck in  Mineral Wells  Texas  down there. It was dark. I went to the police  station and just told them   I wondered if I could stay there all night and  they let me in. Fed me and everything, everything was fine.  One time I was riding the freight train, and they were arresting  everybody that came in on the freight train down at Fort Worth because  somebody   d broke into a load of oranges. I jumped off this freight train  about ten, fifteen miles out of town where it was close to the highway.  So I got out on the highway and oh boy, the first car that came along  stopped. We drove down the road about two or three miles and he  stopped. He says,    You see those fellows over there in the trees?    I  said,    Yeah.    He says,    Go over there with them.    He pulled back his  coat and everything and there was a big star. So he was a sheriff.  (Laughs) Had to spend a couple days in jail.  I got out and couldn   t get a ride so I hid down in some grass, pretty  close to the freight yard. When it got dark   I knew this train was  coming by. I waited and waited until it got going about where I didn   t  think I could make it so I jumped on, and an ole boy was in-between the  cars. He says,    Get off. We shot a fellow off here last night.    I said,     I   ve got to get to Oklahoma.    He says,    Well, get going     It was dark,  I spent some time in the grass there sleeping. I got up and started  walking in the dark and a freight train about daylight came by going  to   coming up to Oklahoma. It was only doing about ten, fifteen miles  an hour. I jumped on it and got off in Ardmore. (Laughs)  I would like to say I was very fortunate on everything I did. All the  hobos that I ran across they were, to me, they were gentlemen. They  were all   no jobs and just going. I went to their camp one night and  there was only three or four of them around. They made some coffee in  a tin can. They treated me just like one of them.  Finchum Somebody was watching out for you.  7  Shipman Oh yeah, like I say, I was very fortunate.  Finchum How many times did you do that?  Shipman About three. I even did it when I was eighteen, I think, about when the  last time I did it.  Finchum Usually by yourself?  Shipman Yeah.  Finchum And because you had to, not because you wanted?  Shipman No, I didn   t have to, but I just knew these people. They were lovely  people. They gave me too much, and I knew that I didn   t belong and it  didn   t settle with me for some reason. I just thought I had to go see my  mom once in a while, but I was flying at the time. I came back to  Oklahoma to see her. I think the last time was either seventeen or  eighteen, but I had that flying in my mind. I was hauling passengers and  all on Saturdays and Sundays just to build up my time. I stayed at that  until I just wasn   t making anything, it was during the Depression. Then  I went to work on the dam. They were building a dam there in  California that I worked at.  Finchum Did you finish high school?  Shipman No. Hell, as I say I haven   t had a high school education.  Finchum Okay. And how hard was it at age sixteen to learn to fly?  Shipman Oh it wasn   t hard, no. Well, that was during the Depression. Then I  soloed when I was sixteen, but I started flying when I was fifteen. It  took me five hours and ten minutes to solo, but that was spent over a  time of about eighteen months. During the Depression, maybe just one  hop around the field, we used automobile gas in the airplanes. Of course  we chamoised all the water, all the good gasoline, to get the water out.  There just wasn   t too many people interested in flying at the time to  afford the   there was three of us. All they was doing was just about  feeding us, but it was worth it  (Laughs)  I know one fellow came and brought something in, one day, like one of  these green trucks that I don   t know what it   if it was Express, what it  was, United, or what, but he was making  50 a week. I thought,    Man,  that   s a millionaire     There just wasn   t much more to think about. I  stayed with that flying and I   m   I guess I   m, like I say, I   m very  8  fortunate. I   m glad I did. I first put an application in with Halliburton in  1935, but I didn   t go to work for them until    47.  Bishop How   d you become interested in flying? What sparked your interest?  Shipman I was riding a bus home from school one day and I saw this airplane  parked in a lot that no airplane ever been in there before. I ran up and  told the driver, I said,    I   d like to get off.    Got off and went over there  and they were starting to build a hangar. I saw this pile of debris by the  flatbed truck there, shovels and all around. I loaded all that on that truck  you know, thinking I was helping somebody. When I got through a  fellow came over and he said,    Do you want to go for an airplane ride?     (Laughs)    Yeah     And that started it. I went to work for him. Just  getting my meals, that   s about all.  Finchum Did you train pilots?  Shipman Yeah. I trained some, I instructed. I went on this dam in    38,    39, up in  Colorado. I heard that they started a CPT course, Civilian Pilot Training  Program. I don   t know whether you know it or not, but they were  training pilots for the war. They knew the war was on, so I went down  to the airport there in Denver. Not the main airport, there was this Park  Hill Airport there north of town. They needed an instructor. So I  instructed in that until they really got into the war effort and they built  this field up at Chickasha to train primary pilots. A fellow I worked for  in Denver started this field so he had his other pilots, the ones with  seniority, come down and go through that part. I finished up all the  other students in Denver. When I did that I came down and instructed in  Chickasha for them. Then went to work for Halliburton in    47.  Finchum Did you serve in the military?  Shipman No. In fact, I was a flight commander up there, and I had one instructor  that the Draft Board had called him up and he was already on his way to  New York. I went down and took a physical. About that time they were  getting rid of all the instructors, so they put us on the Enlisted Reserve  to get us off the Draft Board so we could go ahead and instruct the  pilots.  Finchum You got to do what you wanted to do.  Shipman Well, yeah in a way. Course those boys   now I   m not holding it against  them. It   s just the way I felt at the time. I worked hard for what I did  and this was handed to them on a platter, to learn to fly. There was a  couple   I felt sorry for them, they just couldn   t do it. And this was in  my flight, especially one. He just couldn   t do it, so I said,    I   m going to  9  let you go to somebody else.    They told him the same thing, but most of  them went by. Most of them were real   turned into real good pilots. I  got letters from a few during the war that said they thanked me for what  I   d done for them.  Finchum Did you ever parachute out of one?  Shipman We all wore parachutes.  Finchum But did you have to use one?  Shipman No, thank goodness. There   s one instructor who forgot to fasten his  safety belt or something. He rolled over and he fell out and hit the tail  and knocked him unconscious and killed him.  Finchum After the war what did you do?  Shipman I worked for Haliburton for twenty-five years.  Finchum On planes?  Shipman Flying. I   d fly Mr. Halliburton and all the management and anybody,  salesmen, anybody that did any traveling.  Finchum You took them. Did you retire from there?  Shipman Yeah, I retired in 1973.  Finchum And then what did you do?  Shipman Just lived it easy. (Laughter)  Finchum Then we should back up. Did you get married?  Shipman I got married in    44     Finchum During the war.  Shipman Yeah, married a Chickasha girl while I was here.  Finchum How did you meet her?  Shipman She was a telephone operator. I don   t remember really how I met her,  really. No.  Finchum What would you do for dates?  10  Shipman Well, go to the show is about all we had at that time.  Finchum Did she like to fly?  Shipman She didn   t want to learn how to fly. I put her in the left seat one day and  well, I thought   she didn   t object. I mean if she objected, but see the  Bonanza that I had didn   t have brakes on the right side. They were just  on the left side. The wheel flipped over if you needed it to. We cranked  up and I said,    Okay, you can taxi on out,    and she started up and  headed for the hangar. I said,    Hit the brakes  Hit the brakes     I thought  we was (laughs) going to lose the airplane right there. That made me  wonder, but I left her in there. We went over and picked up her sister in  Ada, and she needed a little help alright, but we got her down alright.  Finchum Did you have children?  Shipman No.  Finchum Did your wife work?  Shipman Yes, she was a telephone operator.  Finchum Oh yeah, you said that. When did you move here?  Shipman After I worked for a month or so, I found a place and rented. We built  out here in    55, eight years after I started working for them. I got fifteen  acres here.  Finchum Been here ever since.  Shipman Yes. Sixty years. (Laughs)  Finchum What would you do for fun?  Shipman Back then   course I was gone a lot. Sometimes I wouldn   t get in until  ten, eleven, twelve o   clock at night. Get up the next morning at seven,  sometimes five. (Laughs) I   d be in Wyoming or some place and pick up  a group by eight o   clock. I wasn   t   outside watching TV. Once in a  while we   d go to a show. We   d go to Lawton, have dinner, and go to a  show or something.  Finchum So did you own your own plane?  Shipman Yeah, had it for a while. I think I kept it about twelve years.  11  Bishop What kind of plane was it?  Shipman Bonanza.  Bishop Bonanza   yeah, he said that.  Finchum What color and did it have a name?  Shipman Old Blue. (Laughs) I got a picture of it here.  Finchum Could you repair it if something went wrong?  Shipman Oh yeah, I had a mechanic   s license. Well, I did have a picture of it     Finchum Ever have any close calls?  Shipman Yeah, about the closest call I had   well I had a fellow land on top of  me one night up in Denver, but the closest call   and he knocked the  wing off. He had on navigation lights, but the battery was about gone on  the lights. I didn   t see him until he was right there. I was instructing. I  had a student over in the left seat. I saw him and I gave it the gun and  kicked it around. He was headed right for us, but he took out the right  wing.  I had a BT-13 too, I owned one. That was a basic training airplane. I  don   t know whether you   re familiar with them. They used them up here  in Enid during the war. Had them for instruments and aerobatics and  one thing and another. I rolled it over one day here in Duncan and the  safety belt broke. It had a canopy and I had the canopy open. Always  just left it open about like that. My head went up and knocked the glass  out. I always rolled with the nose a little high so if you wanted out  against the belt real fast, all the time. When I went out it took that  airplane just a few seconds. I had plenty of speed when I started, but it  took a little while for that nose to drop. When it dropped down about  here it threw me back in the seat. Well I only started about 1,500 feet. I  knew I didn   t have room to half-loop it out so I rolled it out and came  out about 500 feet. That   s probably the worst.  Things could   ve   at that time, a little later, there was a bunch of the  same type airplane. Fellows had noticed they roll over on their back and  then go into the ground, half-loop. I got to thinking, well it must   ve  been   see those airplanes sit out for years and the one I bought was out  at Altus. No, it wasn   t Altus, it was out here some place. It   d sat there  for probably two or three years. The government had them up for sale. I  bought that airplane for  200. Now, after I got rid of it,  40,000.  12  Finchum Wow.  Shipman It was an Army aircraft, airplane, trainer. If I   d had any sense I   d held  onto it. (Laughs) I think I sold it and made four or five hundred dollars  out of it   after that seatbelt broke.  Finchum So you liked to do loop-de-loops?  Shipman Oh, I thought I was an aerobatic pilot, but I didn   t have an airplane with  an inverted system. I used a Stearman. I put on a couple shows. In fact,  I guess the best one was up in Denver when they dedicated that airport  east of town. I put on a show, but had to use a lot of extra speed at that  altitude. It only had a 220 horsepower engine and at that altitude it was  probably putting out about 180. (Laughs) But it worked out fine.  Finchum Did you ever build one?  Shipman Yeah, in fact there   s some pictures. It   s in a museum up in Oklahoma  City. I wanted a Jungmeister, an old German single-seat aerobatic  airplane. It held   today it holds more records aerobatically than any  other aircraft. There   s a picture on the wall over there if you want to see  it.  Finchum How long did it take?  Shipman I bought it   the fuselage was mostly all welded up. I didn   t have to do  but a little welding on it, but I had to build the wings and everything but  the fuselage. It took me about five or six years to do what I did.  Clarence Page was the  director  over at the  Oklahoma Air and Space   Museum in Oklahoma City. He heard about it and so he sent   he and a  couple boys came down. I talked to him, told him it was almost  finished. I had it all ready except to cover it. They wanted it. So it   s in  the museum. They covered it and put it on display. It   s on display up  there.  Finchum Did you fly it first?  Shipman Oh no, I never did get to fly it, which is probably a good thing.  Finchum Didn   t trust your own work, or was it just too old?  Shipman No, everything I put in it was aircraft. When they covered it up there  they didn   t do any ridge stitching. They just put it on for display  purposes, so they didn   t finish it. Everything I did, it was airworthy.  Yeah, I kind of got burnt out on it. Like I say, I   d come home maybe at  13  eight, nine o   clock at night and work on it for   have to get up by seven,  or out by seven, so I just got burnt out on it.  Bishop What in your lifetime was the biggest risk of flying? The most  challenging thing about flying?  Shipman I don   t think there was any really risk. I didn   t fight these thunderstorms  like some did and come out with hail on them and then one thing or  another. I was trying to take care of the passengers. Not only that, I was  trying to take care of me, and if I took care of me the passengers would  be alright. There was only a couple trips that I actually turned down     thunderstorms. I mean one trip I turned down had a line of  thunderstorms all the way from Illinois down to the Gulf Coast.  Somebody wanted something over in Mississippi or something. I just     at that time. Now if they   d had waited half a day or a day or something I  might   ve done it or gone with and done it.  No, there wasn   t really any   I lost one engine is the only thing. I picked  up some passengers to bring them up here and it was instrument  conditions. I checked the weather and everything above   the top of the  cloud was 7,000. So I just filed to get out on top because if you go in  through it, they send you all around and I didn   t have enough fuel to  bring them up here and go to an alternate. The weather was bad up here,  but it was supposed to get better. If I waited a couple hours I thought I   d  make it alright. So they sent me out on the east course. When I got to  7,000 I said,    Hey, there   s clouds above. It looks about 9,000.       Okay.     He cleared the 9,000. I started to climb and the left engine just quit. It  just quit  I was in a partial turn. It didn   t make any noise or anything.  My copilot didn   t know. I told him. I said,    Well, we lost the engine.     He said,    Feather it.    Well, it could be a carburetor fire. I saw the  carburetor temperature had pegged out. I knew we had a carburetor fire  and I turned the gas off to burn out all the gas. The temperature gage,  when it pegged out, it just stuck. I didn   t know whether we had a fire  going or not. I came on back and I didn   t even make an approach. At  the time we didn   t have these navigation places like we have now. I just  let down through the overcast and when I broke out, the airport was  right there. Like I say, I was very fortunate, but I didn   t have a fire. That  was the only time that   and then found out later about ten of those  engines were overhauled with a bad pin that drives the timing pins.  There   s five pins that hold it onto the driveshaft. Spartan in Tulsa did all  of our overhaul. They used some inferior pins. About ten of them, ten  airplanes, had the same effect that I had, later on.  ,  Finchum You have to think on your feet.  14  Shipman You don   t have time to think on your feet. (Laughs) You just got to get  it down. It had one engine, and it   d go on one engine, but how long  would it last if the other one quit? Anyway, I got them down safe and  okay. When I broke out it only had a 400 foot ceiling, but the visibility  was good underneath. The reason I made an approach like I did, I know  all that country down there. At this time, around the airport there   s  nothing but bean fields and they were flat. If I needed to, I could land in  that. As it turned out the airport was, when I broke out of the clouds, the  airport was right there. All I had to do was make a little turn and land.  Finchum They   ve closed a lot of the small ones now, haven   t they? Small  airports?  Shipman I don   t know, I   ve been retired for forty-two years. In forty-two years  they could do a lot.  Finchum How far would you fly?  Shipman I guess the farthest   well, I used to go up into Northwest Canada. Well,  up north of Alaska really, wherever Halliburton had a job. They didn   t  have any   at the time, I don   t know whether they do now or not, but  have a well of their own. All they did was service work. Wherever they  had a field   I guess the longest trip. We had an employee in a wreck  down in Venezuela. We flew down there in a Lodestar, had to pick him  up to bring him back to   we flew down to   I forget the name of the  place, but there in Venezuela. We picked him up and brought him up to  Oklahoma City to the hospital. Which is   I don   t even remember the  mileage, but it   s probably about pretty close to 4,000 miles I imagine.  Finchum Would they give you time to sightsee?  Shipman Occasionally we did. I remember one trip I was coming down back  from Canada and just happened to be over Old Faithful. I was going to  go over Old Faithful. I could see it down there spewing. It spews every  hour. I yelled back to the passenger, I said,    You guys want to see Old  Faithful?       Yeah.    So I got around about a half a circle. I heard one of  the employees, I   d heard him before, he   s      Let   s get out of here     He  didn   t even like just a shallow bank. So I   m sure it disappointed the rest  of the boys, (laughs) but they all got to see a little bit of it. That was the  best sightseeing deal I think we had. I   ve seen a lot of things.  Finchum Pretty places. Challenging landing places?  Shipman Everything   an airplane is built for an airport, but I have landed on  grass strips that didn   t look like much of an airport, but they were  alright to land in. Usually it was an airport that we used.  15  Finchum Did you want to be a commercial pilot?  Shipman No. In fact, I didn   t   before I went to work for Halliburton, course I  was looking around for different jobs flying. All the airlines wanted  people with two years of college. That knocked me out. I was lucky.  Like I say, very fortunate to go to Halliburton. I   ve talked to people     had friends on the airlines and they just went to the same place all the  time. Well we went all over the United States and Canada, Mexico.  That one trip down in Venezuela is the only one really out of town. We  went down to South America one time, but it was just all, as far as I   m  concerned, a better deal than the airlines.  Finchum Well, would you take trips on the airlines?  Shipman Not now. (Laughs)  Finchum But did you? Have you?  Shipman I   ve been on the airlines a couple times and I wasn   t comfortable. I   d  rather be up there in front. You hear these stories, you don   t hear all of  them, but you hear stories. One that   s unbelievable: pilots were flying  this three-engine airplane. Two on the side of this and one in the  middle. They were flying from Dallas to San Diego. About over El Paso  one engine completely fell out of the airplane, one of the outboard ones,  not the one in the tail. They didn   t know it. They went on to San Diego.  (Laughs) You got gauges there that tell you just about everything.  Especially fuel, you know.  Then these pilots got to talking to each other, overshot their runway or  where they were supposed to land. The stewardess came up and said,     Hey, weren   t we supposed to land back there?    About forty-five  minute roundtrip to get back to where they   no, I don   t think I want  any of it. (Laughs) I don   t blame anybody else, but then that   s the  airlines. They don   t let you know everything. They   re afraid they might  scare somebody off the airlines, you know.  Bishop I want to back up. When you were a child, you were at Ardmore?  Shipman Ardmore?  Bishop When you were a foster child, you were in Ardmore?  Shipman Yes.  Bishop Is there a foster home there or was there a foster home?  16  Shipman No, it wasn   t a foster home. It was just foster people. Mother had four  of us at home, single, and I was too young to know what was going on.  Excuse me did I     Finchum No, it   s fine. You   re fine.  Shipman I was too young to know what was going on I guess.  Bishop I was just curious, because in Sand Springs Charles Page started a  home for foster children in Oklahoma, and I didn   t know if you   d ever  been in that one.  Shipman No, like I   m going to say this was probably back in 1919, 1920     Bishop Yeah, that   s a long time ago.  Shipman I guess these people couldn   t have any children or whatever. I never did  talk to them. I didn   t even know   even talk about it, whether they could  have children or what. I didn   t ask them.  Bishop And did you   when you met up with the hobos, did you ever hear of any  stories, kind of hobo stories that you often hear people talk about? Did  you ever encounter any stories from the hobos?  Shipman No, no, they seemed like   back then all I could say is they was just  gentlemen. They never said anything derogatory about anybody,  anything. They was just going from one place to another.  Finchum Mostly men?  Shipman I did run into   on one of my trips that I got on the freight train going  back to California. I got on this train at night and went to sleep and I  guess I heard somebody talking, women talking. What I   d done was get  in the end of one of these freight cars where they put ice and stuff.  That   s where I was. I crawled out of there and got up on top and looked  over and there was three young ladies sitting in the door. (Laughs) They  said,    Hey  Come on down     (Laughs) I had to wait for the first stop  and then I did, I went down there. We all rode that into Phoenix,  Arizona, and law met us there, and he told me to get going. He offered  these three ladies his apartment to stay in for a while I guess, I don   t  know. He told me I better get out of town. (Laughter) I went and hid  until I could find a schedule on the freight train there or something.  Seemed like I had this schedule of all the trains because I met them. I  remember one time I was in Yuma, Arizona, and I even went down,  17  didn   t know any better I guess, just a young kid. I talked to one fellow  and I said,    I   d sure like to catch one of these passenger trains out, but I  never have. I always caught a freight train.       Oh,    he says,    There   s  nothing to it. The back end of the engine, there   s a place.    I said,    Well  can I fit?    He says,    Oh, it   s wide enough to sit down and all.    I said,     How will I catch it?    He says,    We can only do seven miles an hour  across the river there, out of Yuma. We   ll be going slow across there.    I  went down there and waited for that train. Then when it came, boom,  boom    He was going about thirty, forty miles an hour. He wasn   t  doing seven  I never did get on it. (Laughter) I guess they have a  limitation, only so much speed on a bridge or something going across  the river, but boy, he lied to me, whoever it was. (Laughs)  Bishop You must   ve been a good runner. Did you ever play sports or do  anything as a child?  Shipman I could run, I could catch them. Now these hobos they told me, the first  one told me,    Don   t ever catch the back end of a freight.    On a freight  train, on the back side, say it   s going this way, on the back side of this  car is a couple railings. It   s not a stepladder. You grab ahold of that and  it sweeps you off your feet, it   ll throw you in between the cars. Once I  got a hold of one that was going faster than I thought it was. I held on,  but it threw me up against the side of the car. I caught the front of it, but  it had the ladder going up. That was one thing that I hadn   t thought  about, but I appreciated him telling me that. I always caught one with a  ladder anyway, because I   d usually get up on top. If anybody was  walking down to get me   back then they were chasing you off the  freight. They didn   t want you riding them.  I remember one time there coming out of El Paso, I got there by the  railroad tracks, where the road crossed the railroad track. I got up  against the building and some weeds. Waited about an hour to get this  train coming to Oklahoma. Up toward Oklahoma anyway. It was only  doing about maybe ten miles an hour or so. It wasn   t going very fast. I  waited until it   I could see it had a bunch of cars on it. It was just  getting dark   dusk. I mean I could see, but it was dark, but I wanted to  get on one of those cattle cars so I could get inside. I saw it and I ran up  there and I got on it and a flashlight, a big old spotlight hit me. The  police were back and they had this spotlight on me. I jumped off, they  turned it off, I jumped back on. (Laughs) They didn   t   I guess they  looked away or something, because they didn   t turn it back on.  I got in one of those freight cars, cattle car, they have slants so the air  can   well I got inside that. It seemed like they went about ten, fifteen  miles and started slowing down. I wondered why in the world they were  slowing down. Finally they came to a stop. I got over and I could see  18  with a flashlight they were coming down each side of the car and  looking for people on it, see? When they got about two cars down, I  crawled up   held myself up against the roof there. You know, it had  those louvers and I held up there. I could see, they came and shined the  flashlight. Went along, and then went on. Pretty soon it started up, and I  think I rode it up here almost to Ardmore. (Laughs) There were certain  things that you have in your mind   right then it was hard to hitch a ride  on the road.  Bishop Did you ever think, with all these adventures and things that you   ve  been through, did you ever think you   d make it to 100?  Shipman Oh no, never even   like I say, I   ve been on borrowed time for twenty  years. I thought if I made it past forty I did pretty good. (Laughter) Tell  me, you folks in this program, you have people with   their balance.  Course you said they had this macular degeneration     Bishop What do you see as your biggest challenge at 100?  Shipman I   d like to get over   I exercise my old knees. I   ve asked many doctors,  they can   t do anything about   I   m sure it   s the macular degeneration. If  I could get rid of that, that   d help my balance, but there   s something in  my head. I   m not   I don   t know whether it   s the medication. I   m  wearing a pacemaker. I   ve tried to stay   avoid these doctors, but we  need them. When I had that thing pass on my knee where they shoot  you with that needle, they prescribed Bextra. I took that Bextra for  about a year and then they took it off the market. It was effecting  peoples    heart, so they took it off the market. Now I don   t whether that  effected my heart or what, but I   ve always took my own pulse for years.  I   d do exercise or run.  Back then they were saying check your pulse, get it to 120 and see how  fast it comes back down. When I was exercising one morning   and  after exercising and resting, it   d be about sixty. One morning it was  about in the fifties. I had to   I was getting a six-month blood check in a  week or so after that. I went in for this blood check and the nurse took  my pulse, didn   t say anything about it, and took my blood. I said,    Do  you think we ought to talk to the doctor about my pills?       No, you   re  going to be here in a day or two and talk to him.    I went in to check  how my blood was and I found out everything seemed to be alright. I  said,    Doc, could you take my pulse?    (Laughs) I think it was about  forty-eight. He said,    You need a pacemaker     I said,    Yeah, I was in  here the other day and the nurse, I said it was low, and I asked her...    I  wasn   t blaming anybody. Had a pacemaker.  19  Getting back to it. Some of these people that make it to 100, now I   m  not saying they do. I believe that I know about two or three sources that  they didn   t check their pulse and it just goes down and you don   t feel  bad. When I went in to get my pacemaker it was down to forty-four,  pulse rate. I was feeling like I am right now. I think that you   I   ve  asked the doctors. They don   t know, but I think I had an uncle, he was  driving a weed eater and just fell off of it and died. That might   ve had     well, the heart problem. That   s a heart problem, if it quits, you got heart  problems. And two or three other people that I know, I   ve asked people  down at the senior citizens a couple times,    Hey, do you ever take your  pulse?       No, no, leave that to the doctor?    One fellow, he was a having  a little problems and he didn   t know what   and I said,    Do you check  your pulse?       No.    I said,    Let me check it.    I checked it and it felt   I  didn   t have a second hand on the watch or anything, but I was just  going.    It feels alright, but,    I said,    you ought to have it checked.     Well, he didn   t last very long, so I   m thinking that people that don   t  check their own pulse, they might fall over dead. People say,    Well,  why?    See what I mean?  Bishop What   s your secret to living so long? What   s your secret to longevity?  Shipman I wish I could tell you  (Laughter) I have no reason. Like I say, none of  my old friends made it over eighty-five. A lot of them   my copilot was  only seventy-two.  Bishop What   s a typical day like for you? What time do you get up and what do  you do during the day? When do you go to bed?  Shipman Now you mean?  Bishop Yes.  Shipman Now I get up at six thirty. Ralph and I will go have breakfast, by the  time I get through   course I use contact lens. It takes me a little while  to get my lens in and he comes by about nine and we go have breakfast  up there.  Bishop Who   s Ralph? Who is that? Is it a neighbor?  Shipman Yeah, this little red house over here. He lives in it.  Bishop So he picks you up and takes you to breakfast?  Shipman Yeah, he drives me around. I think I could still drive, but he doesn   t  want me to. Now I can see, like I say if I just look at something right  straight it   s not there, but my peripheral vision is pretty good. I can   t  20  recognize faces. That   s because I can   t focus, but I can see you wear  glasses, but I can   t see your eyes. I can see your glasses, but I can see  well enough to drive.  Bishop Where does Ralph take you typically during the day?  Shipman We go have breakfast up there at the truck center there   truck stop.  Come home, I rest a little bit. I do a lot of resting. Eleven-thirty we go  down to the center and have lunch. I play pool until about two-thirty, he  comes by and picks me up and whatever else he needs to do. Come  home and rest and then usually I   ll buy a dinner and they   ll come over  and eat, or they   ll fix dinner and come over and we eat. He   s done a lot  and especially for the wife. She was on oxygen and wherever she went  she had to take that oxygen. They had that oxygen tank on the dolly.  Ralph just took her everywhere, and he   s taken good care of me.  Finchum Lucky to have him.  Shipman Oh yeah  I guess he was having problems. I   ve had this rent house  for   well, ever since we was over here. The last people I rented to, they  tore out a wall and put in an air-conditioner, one thing or another. When  they moved it just made me feel bad. I told the wife, I said,    We just  won   t rent it anymore.    Well, couple days Ralph showed up with his  wife and two children and asked if   that he heard that I had a place to  rent. I said,    Well, the people that lived in there tore out this section of  the wall and put an air-conditioner in. If you want to live in it I   ll give  you the key, you go look at it, and rent-free, you just keep the place up.  Keep it halfway decent.    I gave him the key, he came back, and he said,     Yeah.    So that   s the way it   s been for about fifteen years. He says he  was sent here to take care of us. (Laughter) That suits me. He   s going to  get all this property, the fifteen acres. He   s going to get this for   and  it   s worth more than that to me the way he treated the wife and me. See  what I mean?  Finchum I do.  Shipman He   s been real good. Never said anything. I got on to him, I blew up.  He   s hard on brakes. (Laughter) I blew up, I   ve been putting up with it  for over a year. See, doing the speed limit he goes from the gas, the  foot-feed. It   s only from here to there where he   s going to turn, there   s a  stop. It   s the last bit in   I kind of blew up. I don   t treat the car that way.  In fact, one night I came in with an airplane and I didn   t have one brake.  I   ve always taken good   not try to overuse any brakes or anything. It  just built up on me. The last fifty feet is left. Probably like most people,  but anyway, I just blew up and lost my   he never said any   but he said  he   d rather drive his car than mine. (Laughter) I   m sorry I didn   t ever  21  tell him about it, because I   m afraid if I bring it up it may upset him.  I   ve had other fellows drive me and they   re not like that either. Usually  if you   re doing fifty-five say, I usually get off the foot-feed and coast  for a quarter of a mile or so. You don   t come to a stop, you just slow  down slow. You don   t have to get on the brakes, but not him. He   s still  doing it with his car. (Laughter)  Bishop But he takes good care of you.  Shipman Oh  He takes good care of   he   s been a tremendous help   Bishop It   s good to have somebody like that.  Shipman It   s really, I guess   see, I haven   t any mobility. Even the last almost  year I couldn   t do anything. I told the wife,    If you fall Hon, I can   t  help you.    She did fall. I couldn   t get her up. That eats on me. I called  911. Ralph, I couldn   t get him on his phone, but I called 911. They  came and it took about three of those big firemen to get her up off the  floor in there, in the bedroom. I just can   t do anything. Whatever Ralph  does, I can   t. He writes the checks for me, which I   ve tried to do away. I  don   t own a credit card. If you   re going to write a check to the credit  card, you might as well write it to the people that you owe it to. But  he   s been a tremendous help, really.  Finchum What time do you go to bed?  Shipman Well, I go to bed before the chickens. (Laughs) Right now I try to get in  bed about eight o   clock. Like last night we had overcast, it got dark. I  mean it was a little dark by seven-fifteen or so. When it   s like that I   ll  get ready for bed. Usually get in bed by eight, sometimes nine o   clock,  but mostly around eight, eight-thirty. I can   t watch TV. I can   t read.  What is there to do? See? So I just rest a lot. I try to get up about ever  thirty minutes, walk around, get back, and rest. I   m just putting up with  it, I   m not worrying about it.  Finchum How did you celebrate your birthday?  Shipman I didn   t celebrate it, they celebrated it for me  The senior citizens down  there had a real   they surprised me. They had a big birthday party. I   ve  got a letter from the governor, even one from Obama, 100-year deal you  know. It was real nice birthday party. A whole crowd down there, but  I   m not much on this hoopla deal. I don   t care about that. It was a real  nice party and they surprised me.  Bishop When history is written, what would you like it to say about you? How  do you want to be remembered?  22  Shipman Really I never thought anything about that. I   ve tried to play low-key all  my life. I don   t   anything that I   ve done, people can do. Some are  doing it, anybody can do it. I   m just a person. Nothing special, just so  happened   like I say, I   ve been very fortunate in everything I   ve done.  Seems like it   s turned out in good shape. I have no complaints about  anything, nothing. I just live minute to minute. (Laughs) Heck with this  day stuff.  Bishop You   re down to the minutes, not the day.  Shipman Yeah. (Laughter)  Bishop One minute at a time, not one day at a time.  Shipman Right  Who knows, if I could get my head straight and get off this  imbalance deal, my old knees, I   d be in good shape  (Laughs)  Finchum Ready for another ten or twenty years.  Shipman Well, at least. (Laughter)  Bishop Do you have anything on your bucket list? Anything that you would like  to do that you haven   t done before?  Shipman No, like I say, I have no mobility. I can   t do anything. I   ve either got to  be holding onto something   if I   m sitting down, fine, but if I   m up, I   ve  got a hold on something. I can   t even go look in a drawer. I can   t stand  up and use one hand to open a drawer. You   ve got to use both hands  and by the time I get it with both hands I   m ready to fall. I   ve fallen so  many times, I don   t want to fall anymore. (Laughs) So I   ll give that up.  So I   m just looking at it     Bishop One last time in the sky?  Shipman From all these pilots and everything, if I could fly, even if the engine  quit I think I could take care of it now. You know, with my macular  degeneration, though, I can see to get an airplane down I   m sure. No, I  don   t want to do anything. I   m just happy the way it is.  Bishop Content.  Finchum That   s a good way to end, so thank you for talking with us today.  Shipman I   m glad to.  23  Finchum It   s been a pleasure.  Shipman I   ve enjoyed it.  -------  -------
