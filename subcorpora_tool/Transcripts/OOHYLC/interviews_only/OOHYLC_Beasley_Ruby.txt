 Finchum Today is May 5, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum along, with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in  Sulphur, Oklahoma to speak with Ruby Beasley, and this is part of our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life. Thank you for having us today. Let   s start  with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Beasley I was born within five miles of Ardmore (Oklahoma) on Caddo Creek. I  was born the sixth of November, 1910. I was born on Sunday.  Finchum On Sunday. At home?  Beasley Yeah, at home.  Finchum The doctor came?  Beasley Dr. Higgins. He was with Momma with us kids. He was with me with  three of mine.  Finchum That   s a pretty good record.  Beasley That   s right. He was with Momma when I was born. Then, he was with  me with three of my kids.  Finchum So he made house calls.  Beasley Yeah, he made house calls. I never had a one of mine in the hospital.  They was all at home.  Finchum Well, did you say you had brothers and sisters?  Beasley I have sisters, no brothers.  5  Finchum No brothers. Older or younger than you?  Beasley I had one sister four years older than me and three younger.  Finchum Okay.  Beasley They were five of us.  Finchum Five girls. That made for an interesting household didn   t it?  Beasley Only I was a boy. I was Dad   s cowboy.  Finchum You were?  Beasley That   s right.  Finchum How did that happen?  Beasley Well, he just called me his cowboy. I rode a horse and everything just  like he did. Everything. I was his cowboy.  Finchum You grew up on a farm, or a ranch?  Beasley On a ranch, ten miles south of town here.  Finchum How big was it? How many acres?  Beasley Eleven hundred I think is what Dad had.  Finchum That   s quite a bit of property.  Beasley And there   s artesian caves in that pasture. When Dad bought that place,  we were told that a man raised nine kids in that cave. When we moved  there, over there at the caves we found a piece of an old iron bedstead  there and some of these here ole high top button shoes like women used  to wear, you know, a hundred years ago. We found one or two of them  over there. You see, when you go down in that cave, there is a great big  huge rock. It   s that long, and it   s that wide, and it   s that thick, and it   s  across here. (Gesturing) To go down in the cave, you had to stoop over  to go under that rock. Then, go two or three steps, then turn to your  right and you   re in a big room. Did you ever hear of them artesian  caves?  Finchum I have not, no.  6  Beasley Well, that   s where they are. Every time me and Mama and Dutch,  Dutch was my younger sister, every time we went over there. See, there  was an iron ladder that goes down to the water. I would always go down  that iron ladder. There was an old tin cup hanging here. I   d get that old  tin cup and reach down there and get an ice cold drink of water, and  hand it up there to Mama and Dutch. It   s just   a stream runs through  there. I don   t know how wide it is. Something like that I guess. It just  runs right through there.  Everybody   on Sundays and Saturdays, there used to be people going  over there all the time to go to the caves. One time there was two men  that went over there. They took, I don   t know how many balls of  binding twine or how many feet is on a ball of binding twine. I used to  know, but I don   t now. They had tied that at the entrance of the cave.  When you got out of that first room, why, there was this big round hole,  and you crawl through that and you are in another room. It goes on and  on and on, like that. As far as them balls of binding twine would go,  that   s how far those two men went. It was still a going. The same thing.  Big hole, you crawl through, you in another big room, and all like that.  Finchum Was the stream going along with that or     Beasley Oh yeah, that was going all the time. In there somewhere, I guess that  guy that raised the nine kids in there, he had a canoe. He   d get in that  canoe, and go as far as he could in the canoe, then he   d get out and  crawl through that hole, and get in another canoe. Go as far as he could  in it, and on and on and on like that. Nobody has ever been to where it  goes. I heard that Brown filled the entrance up to that cave. I bet you a  pretty may heart, I doubt if he knows anything about the cave. I sure  would like to talk to him about that.  Finchum You also had a cave on your property or is this the same one?  Beasley Same one.  Finchum Same one.  Beasley Over there in our pasture. Not too far from the windmill, it was right  southeast of the windmill. The windmill is sitting right there over a  big   you can go down like this as far as you could walk, then you get  down on your knees, and crawl down to the water. All you can see,  nothing but water. Nothing but water.  Finchum Sounds like your father picked a good piece of property?  7  Beasley I guess he didn   t know all about all of that either when he bought it. I  doubt it. He knew about the   when Dad bought it though, we were told  about the cave, that some man raised nine kids in it. Well, I guess he did  because we found, when we moved there, we found the high top button  shoes you know, a couple of them, and a piece of an old iron bedstead.  Finchum Well, what did your father grow on the property? Cattle or cotton, or  what?  Beasley Yeah, we had cattle. We raised red top cane, high gear, and corn. That   s  all we planted in rows. I planted every bit of it when I could just reach  up like this (gestures) and hold up a one-row planter, pulled by a mule. I  planted all of it. Of course, Dad went along and made the furrows.  Finchum You worked with a mule?  Beasley Why yeah   Finchum Did it have a name?  Beasley Well, I think the one we had pulling that was named Rody.  Finchum Rody.  Beasley We had two white-nosed mules, that was Jack and Rody. Now lady, we  had five mules, the best mules in the country, and we had them. Back  when I was born, I was born on the north side of Caddo Creek. I was  about maybe two years old, or not quite two, why, Momma was  pregnant with Dutch, and she got double pneumonia, and Doc Higgins  come out the house and stayed ten days, or he stayed until Momma got  well. When he come, the first thing he asked Dad was if he had any  whiskey. Dad told him no, he sure didn   t. He said,    Well go get some.     So Dad saddled up his horse and went into Ardmore, five miles. He was  going to take the short cut, so they swum Caddo Creek, cause he was  going the short cut.  Dad went and got the whiskey. They made up one of these big goblets  full of toddy. Well, they set it on the machine. See, Momma   s cousin  was staying there, supposed to be taking care of me and Vera, and doing  the cooking and everything, help taking care of Momma because Doc  Higgins was there and everything. They set that goblet of toddy on the  machine. Well, nobody paying any attention to me, so I got a chair,  pushed it up back of the machine and drank every bit of it. (Laughter)  So they were shed of me for a day or two, but they knew what was the  matter with me, you know.  8  Finchum Sure. How do you make a toddy? What   s in it besides whiskey?  Beasley A little water and sugar.  Finchum So it tasted okay.  Beasley Why, it was good. My lands, it was good   Finchum When you say machine, what kind of machine?  Beasley What?  Finchum You said it was setting on a machine?  Beasley Sewing machine. Just like that one right there.  Finchum One of the treadle ones where you use the feet?  Beasley Yeah. Yeah.  Finchum Okay, I didn   t know.  Beasley Yeah, well that   s what it was. That   s the only kind Momma ever had.  That was Momma   s machine, setting right there.  Finchum She sewed a lot?  Beasley Oh yeah. She sewed and made all the girls basketball bloomers.  Finchum Bloomers?  Beasley That   s what they had to wear then. They didn   t go half naked like they  do now.  Finchum Did you play?  Beasley Well land yeah, I played. The Nebo (Oklahoma) girls never was beat.  Finchum Hmm     Beasley We   d played, we could go to Dougherty, we could go to Palmer,  anywhere we went. They could come to our court. It didn   t make any  difference. The Nebo girls won. Every game they ever played. They  never was beat. When we would go to them or they would come there,  we would say,    Wash them out, wring them out, hang on them line. We  can beat Palmer any old time.     9  Finchum And you did?  Beasley We did, or Dougherty or whoever we was playing. We could go to their  court and next time maybe they come to ours.  Finchum Were the courts inside or outside?  Beasley Outside. Outside.  Finchum Dirt or concrete or?  Beasley Dirt.  Finchum Dirt?  Beasley Why lord yes. We didn   t have concrete and nothing inside then, when I  went to school.  Finchum So you had to play only when it was nice weather?  Beasley Why you couldn   t play out there if it was raining or too cold.  Finchum Okay. Just checking.  Beasley Yeah.  Finchum What position did you play?  Beasley Forward, me and Laura Mann or Alma Kirby either one.  Finchum That was when they had the court divided into three sections?  Beasley That   s right.  Finchum Okay.  Beasley That   s right.  Finchum So, how many years did you go to that school?  Beasley Well, I went to Mill Creek in the ninth grade. The eighth grade is all  they done down there at Nebo.  Finchum Okay.  10  Beasley Was the eighth grade.  Finchum How would you get to school?  Beasley A bus. I rode the bus to Mill Creek, but to go to Nebo we walked.  Finchum You walk. About how far was it from your place?  Beasley It was two and a quarter mile.  Finchum One way.  Beasley One way and we walked. Me and Dad, in the winter time of course, we  had to get up and go feed them cattle. That clock I   ve got in yonder now  of theirs, of Momma   s and Dad   s, why when it struck four, Dad would  holler,    Ruby, four o   clock. Time to get up.    I   d get up and build a fire  in the heater, get my clothes on, go build a fire in the cook stove and get  breakfast. Me and Dad would eat, then we got out and went and fed  them cattle. We always tried to get back in time, we tried to get back by  seven o   clock. I   d run in and change my clothes right quick, put me a  sausage between a biscuit, and a hard fried egg between a biscuit, and  wrap it up in newspaper and hit the road.  Finchum What were your sisters doing while you were doing all that work?  Beasley They wasn   t doing anything to help me. (Laughter) They were not, any  of them, Momma or them either one, wasn   t even up. Me and Dad  would eat breakfast by ourselves. Then we got out and went and got the  team, loaded up the wagon, loaded a hundred bundles of red top cane on  the wagon. Dad would load it one morning, I   d load it the next. We  always took the horse just in case some of them weren   t there. Dad  counted them every day. If they was anything that wasn   t there, hunted  them up. Had the horse over there and hunted them up.  Bishop Did you ever have to drive the cattle to town?  Beasley Huh?  Bishop Did you ever have to drive the cattle to town or to market?  Beasley No  Lord no, I didn   t drive nothing. Jim Bales came out there one time  and he bought, I forget now how many steers we had. Jim Bales, he   s  dead though now, long, long time ago.  Bishop How did you deal with ticks and other animals when it came to your  cattle?  11  Beasley How did it deal with what?  Bishop Like ticks and other bugs, and other things that would make cattle sick.  Did you ever have to deal with that?  Beasley No   Bishop Take them to the pond or anything like that?  Beasley Take them to where?  Bishop To the pond, to get rid of the ticks?  Beasley We took them one time. There was somebody, it wasn   t us, got ticks on  their cattle. Course, you had to dip them. They made everybody dip  their cattle. Ours didn   t have a tick on them, but we had to take them  and dip them. Well, course we had to round them up way over there in  the pasture, then had to take them through some people   s, nearly their  yard, and take them a mile west up there at old Dog Tail Corner, that   s  where the dipping vat was. Had to take the   you talk about it ain   t a  job, taking a hundred and sixty or seventy head of cattle all that way  from the pasture over yonder clear up there. I was one of the cowboys  that helped take them, take them up there. Of course Dad had to hire  four or five guys to help, you know. That   s the way we got the cattle  dipped. Then of course, had to take them back.  Finchum Took all day?  Beasley Huh?  Finchum Did it take all day?  Beasley Just about it. Just about it.  Finchum You have company. Let   s stop just a minute. We were talking about  cattle drives when we stopped.  Beasley Well, we just had to drive them over there and back. Course like I said,  Dad would have to hire at least four guys and then there would be me  and Dad, you know.  Finchum Your sisters didn   t help with that either?  Beasley Oh lord, no. They never rode a horse in their life, I don   t guess.  12  Finchum Well, did they help your mother with cooking or cleaning, and that sort  of thing?  Beasley Oh some, yeah, oh yeah.  Finchum In other words, they had a pretty easy life compared to what you were  doing?  Beasley I did our plowing, planting, everything.  Finchum Did you enjoy doing that?  Beasley Why yeah, I loved to. It   s all I knew to do.  Finchum Well, all that work, what would you do for fun?  Beasley You can hand me my hat over there if you want to take a picture of me  with my hat on.  Bishop I was getting an action shot.  Finchum We   ll take one afterwards.  Beasley Did you get it? You didn   t get my hat.  Finchum No, we   ll take one after we finish. We will take one with the hat.  Beasley Oh, okay.  Finchum You wore it most of the time I bet.  Beasley I wear it all the time. Everywhere I go, I wear my hat. Don   t nobody  know me if I haven   t got my hat on.  Finchum Did you wear one when you were helping your father?  Beasley Why lord yes  Heck yeah.  Finchum Tell me about the house you grew up in.  Beasley Well, when we first moved there, it was just a two-room house. Dad  built a great big huge kitchen onto it. Had the kitchen and Momma  made our dining table. Made the bench that us kids sat on and  everything. Momma made her cabinet too. Cabinet she had at that time,  she made it.  13  Finchum How did she learn to do that?  Beasley I don   t know how she learned, she just knew how.  Finchum I wondered if her dad taught her.  Beasley She never did see her dad. Her dad died before she was ever born.  Finchum So she figured out how to solve problems then.  Beasley She just knew how to do things is all I can tell you. But Momma would  have made a good carpenter. She could have built a house. If she would  have been a man and had everything, why, she could have built the  house.  Finchum Well, where did you girls all sleep?  Beasley In the bed. (Laughter)  Finchum Did you all share a room, all five of you in one room?  Beasley Well, all five of us wasn   t there at one time.  Finchum Okay.  Beasley When Vera got sixteen years old, she got married, Jake Kirby. I wasn   t  ever in bed too long. Yeah, we slept together.  Finchum To stay warm.  Beasley We had to, to stay warm them days.  Finchum The house was heated by wood?  Beasley Yes. Yeah.  Finchum And the bathroom was out back?  Beasley It was out in the   not in the yard. It was out away from the house.  Finchum How would you all do bath time?  Beasley Huh?  Finchum How would you do bath time?  14  Beasley In a tub.  Finchum In the kitchen?  Beasley Well, in there somewhere.  Finchum Warm the water on the stove?  Beasley Yes.  Finchum Well, if you did all that work, what would you do for fun?  Beasley A little more work. That   s right. If you got out there and worked about  sun up to about sun down, what else would you want to do for fun?  Finchum Go to sleep I guess.  Beasley Well, we all went to bed at eight o   clock. Everybody went to bed at  eight o   clock.  Bishop What time do you get up and go to bed today?  Beasley Well, I went to bed about eleven o   clock last night. I listened to David  Letterman and them. You know they had it from way back there when  Johnny Carson was on. Way back there. I think the twentieth of this  month will be his last show.  Finchum Then what time did you get up today?  Beasley This morning?  Finchum Yes.  Beasley Oh it was between six and seven.  Finchum So not four o   clock?  Beasley Well no, it wasn   t four o   clock. I could have been up at four o   clock  though.  Finchum I believe it. Was church something that you went to a lot when you were  growing up?  Beasley Yeah, we used to walk of the morning and go to Nebo. Mr. Emerson  was the preacher down there. He was a little old bitty, white-headed  15  guy. We went in the day time, but we didn   t go at night. Dad and them  wouldn   t let us. Too far to walk in the dark.  Finchum Was it a Baptist church, or a Methodist, or what?  Beasley I don   t know what it was now.  Finchum Did they do baptisms?  Beasley Not down there. There wasn   t nowhere to go.  Finchum Okay. So where did you graduate high school?  Beasley I didn   t graduate from high school.  Finchum All right. How far did you get?  Beasley I just lacked a little bit going through the ninth grade.  Finchum Okay.  Beasley Over there at Mill Creek.  Finchum Did you get married at that time?  Beasley Yes.  Finchum How did you meet your husband?  Beasley He was working for Hayden Simpson, the next door down from where  we lived.  Finchum What would you do for dates?  Beasley Huh?  Finchum What would you do for a date?  Beasley Well, he come up there and we would go there in the pasture. Dutch or  somebody took a picture of us setting on the corral gate over there.  That   s about all.  Finchum Go to any dances?  Beasley No. Dutch and Buster used to have an all-night dance and a midnight  supper. Then somebody else would have it at their house the next  16  Saturday night and on like that. That   s the only time we ever went to a  dance or anything.  Finchum Was Sulphur the closest town to where you were growing up?  Beasley Well, yeah.  Finchum Was it?  Beasley Cause it   s just ten miles down here, where we lived. Sulphur was closer  than Ardmore or Mill Creek.  Finchum Did it have a movie theatre?  Beasley I think so. Never did go to it though.  Finchum Too busy working.  Beasley That   s right. That   s right.  Bishop Going back to your husband, how old were you when you got married?  Beasley Sixteen.  Finchum How old was he?  Beasley Twenty-two.  Finchum So he robbed the cradle?  Beasley Well, he was twenty-two.  Finchum Then you stayed here in Sulphur when you married?  Beasley No, we moved to Ardmore. We didn   t live in town in Ardmore. We  lived out on E.T. Foster   s place. That was just out east of the fair-ground  right there.  Finchum Well, who did your dad hire to replace you?  Beasley Well, it wasn   t too long until he sold out, because he didn   t have  nobody to help. If I had had any sense, I never would have got married  and stayed there. Yeah.  Finchum Really?  17  Beasley That   s right.  Bishop Did you and your husband stay in Oklahoma the whole time?  Beasley Me and   I called him F.E., his name was Francis (Earl). We stayed  around Ardmore there until we separated. He   s the one that did the  separating. It wasn   t me. Then, later in    46 me and George got married,  but he died eighteenth of May, of    90.  Finchum Have any children?  Beasley Me and Francis had four, three girls and a boy. My son he just passed  away the fourteenth of March and was buried on the nineteenth of this  year. Five years ago today, my daughter passed away.  Finchum Pretty hard to deal with those losses.  Beasley Why you sure hate to.  Finchum Yeah, you do.  Beasley You know.  Finchum Did George have any children before he married you?  Beasley Had two girls, but they are both gone. Rachel had cancer and she gave  her body to science. I don   t know what Eunice done, she lived in  Arkansas.  Bishop Did you and George stay in Oklahoma?  Beasley No  He went down there to see his dad. Hadn   t seen him in twenty-six  years. Went down there, and I went to California out there at my  sister   s, at Dutch   s house. Then, I went from California to San Antonio.  We got married. The guy that married us didn   t have no arms. He didn   t  have (gestures hands), he could write with his toes. He had someone to  help him, you know.  Finchum Did you work when you were in California?  Beasley Yes.  Finchum What did you do?  Beasley I run the dry cleaning and laundry truck.  18  Finchum You drove it and picked up?  Beasley I sure did.  Finchum Then in San Antonio, what did you do?  Beasley I worked in Handy Andy   s grocery store. Then, we went to work for  Rio Vista. I drove a milk truck and picked up people   s milk and took it  to the plant. Then, I worked in the ice cream plant.  Finchum Did you get to sample the product?  Beasley Why lord yes  You eat all you wanted.  Finchum Do you still like ice cream?  Beasley I   m not crazy about it. I can tell you one thing. The real ice cream is the  only one that is fit to eat. That ice milk and all of that stuff is no good.  It   s made with water, so the real ice cream is the only one that is fit to  eat.  Finchum Well then, when did you come back to Oklahoma?  Beasley Huh?  Finchum When did you come back to Oklahoma?  Beasley January of    80.  Finchum To here in Sulphur?  Beasley Huh?  Finchum To here?  Beasley Yeah.  Finchum To here.  Beasley Been right here ever since.  Finchum I   m curious, what was Dutch   s real name?  Beasley Thelma Charlie.  Finchum Charlie. Your dad was still hoping for a boy, with Charlie?  19  Beasley I don   t know. Vera my sister, Vera she married Jake Kirby and they had  Charlie Kirby. They had one kid. He lives in Stratford. His name is  Charlie Samuel. That is my sister   s, he is my nephew. They ain   t any of  us living now, but me and Cricket, and she lives in Garland, Texas.  Finchum Cricket?  Beasley Well, that   s her nickname and Snooks is his nickname. Been called that  all their life.  Finchum Hey   Beasley Her name is Jessie Charlie Elizabeth. She goes by Cricket.  Finchum Well, are you the first one to make it to a hundred in your family?  Beasley That   s right. Vera was ninety-two when she passed away and so was  Dutch. Vera passed away the fourth of January of    99. Dutch passed  away the fifth of August of I guess 2005. No, she didn   t pass away the  fifth. Her birthday was the thirty-first of May and she lived until the  thirty-first of August. She was ninety-one and three months. She died  on the fifth of August.  Finchum The other two sisters?  Beasley Ruth she passed away in    62. She had cancer. No, she was sixty-two  years old, but she passed away in    82.  Finchum Then the other one? There were five of you?  Beasley Cricket, well she   s still living.  Finchum I got you. I   m caught up.  Beasley She is still living. Me and her are the only ones living.  Finchum What do you think your secret is to living so long?  Beasley Work.  Finchum Work.  Beasley That   s right. Over there long ago one day I went with Frances, my  daughter, she   s eighty-seven, my daughter is.  20  Finchum Well, she   s going to make it to a hundred, too, I   d say.  Beasley Well, I wouldn   t know. I was seventeen when she was born, and now  she   s eighty-seven.  Finchum I was thinking maybe yours might have been that cold water from the  spring.  Beasley I didn   t get to drink enough of that. I drink this Sulphur water.  Finchum Well, maybe that   s the secret then.  Beasley Well, if you have a urinary tract infection or anything like that. That   s  what you need to drink. People from Oklahoma City will come down  here with those big old five-gallon glass jugs, or ten gallons or whatever  it is and get that Sulphur water. They do it all the time.  Bishop I want to back up a bit. We talked, whenever I was here, about finding a  silver dollar.  Beasley Oh, I found (laughs), when we lived down there by Buck Irwin Springs,  why I just a little bitty kid. I wasn   t even old enough to go to school. I  found a silver dollar sticking halfway up out of the ground. I   ve still got  that dollar. It was made in 1889. I   ve got a silver dollar that Francis, my  husband, gave me to have some pictures developed with, but I never did  because it was made in 1888. That was the year that Momma was born  then. This one I found was made in    89. That was Ms. Bostic   s birthday.  They used to come up to our house one Sunday, we   d go down there the  next. They come to ours the next, we   d go down there next, on like that  for years and years      Phone rings   Finchum Well, do you have a favorite childhood memory?  Beasley Well lord ha    mercy, I liked everything we did.  Finchum No one thing sticks out? What about Christmas time?  Beasley Well, one time, we still lived down there at the Buck Irwin Springs.  Well, of course me and Dutch just little kids, Dad, he would tease us.     Well, Santa Claus can   t come tonight, the weather   s too bad. He can   t  make it.    He   d kid us like that all the time. Well, of course we didn   t  know whether he is coming or not. Dad would say,    No. He won   t be  here tonight, because the weather   s too bad and he can   t make it.    But  we hung up our stockings anyway. We had a fireplace. I   d hang mine  21  on one side. Dutch would hang hers on the other side. Vera, she had to  hang hers on the back of a chair. You know the way that was made  then, why the post of the chair, you would come up like this you know,  and you could just hang your stocking over that you see. That   s the way  Vera done.  I remember Ole Santa Claus did come and brought Vera a great big  elephant that tall (gestures), but I guess it got burned up or something  another when their house burned. Anyway, me and Dutch   oh yeah,  Vera   s stocking, you know, would be filled with oranges and apples and  candy and nuts. Well ours would be too. I remember one time we had a  little doll and a doll bed. The bed would fold up, flat. Momma made  little sheets and pillow cases and things for our doll bed, made dresses  and things for our dolls. The one I had was name Marion. It was on the  back of her here (gestures), on the head. Her name was Marion. She  was blonde headed. Dutch   s was black headed, but it didn   t have a  name on it, either. We had those dolls for years and years and years. I  think it was when somebody come and we was playing, you know, and  mine got broke   my doll got broke.  Finchum Couldn   t be fixed?  Beasley No.  Finchum No.  Beasley No, it couldn   t be fixed. Vera, she had a doll. Oh it was great tall like  that. Oh it had the knees and arms and everything was jointed. You  could do the arms any way, you know. Her legs too. They were jointed.  Her doll was made of leather like. White leather, I guess you would call  it leather. Some kind of stuff. Snooks, Charlie Kirby, he   s still got that  doll.  Finchum Neat.  Beasley Yeah, he   s still got that doll.  Finchum Was your father and mother born in Oklahoma or did they come here  from somewhere else?  Beasley Dad came from Tennessee and Momma from Georgia. Dalton, Georgia.  Finchum Where in Tennessee?  Beasley Where is it?  22  Finchum Where in Tennessee? Do you know?  Beasley If you can name over some places, I might could tell you.  Finchum Chattanooga, Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Sevierville     Beasley Oh, I don   t remember now. But anyway, hey came from Tennessee  when Dad just a boy. And where that Wellston Oilfield is now. Dad  plowed up a hundred acres of land there with oxen, where that Wellston  Oilfield is now. And dad showed me and Dutch the little log house that  Grandpa built.  Finchum Oh     Beasley Yeah. Dad   s brother lived in at Walters. Dad went out there and took  me and Dutch with him. We stayed about a week, I think, out there.  They had a self-playing piano. Self-playing piano, and lord me and  Dutch thought that was the... (laughs) we couldn   t get over it playing  itself, you know. They let us play it all day if we really wanted to.  (Laughs) I remember when we was coming back home, he had his  youngest brother. They were just three of them. Well, they had a little  sister, but it died when it was a baby. As we were coming back, we  came by Ragtown. Have you ever heard of Ragtown?  Finchum No, I haven   t.  Beasley Well, Uncle Bob lived at Ragtown. We came by there and stayed all  night. Well, him and Aunt Lizzie had   they had three kids, but the boy,  Calvin was his name, and he was a wrestler. I think it was a wrestler or  a boxer or something. Anyway, he got his ribs broke and gangrene set  up and killed him. Well, like I said, when we were coming from Uncle  Temp   s, we come back by Uncle Bob   s and stayed all night. Well, I  remember Dad or Uncle Bob one, give Hazel, and Beatrice, and me,  and Dutch, all a nickel a piece to go up there to the store and get us an  ice cream cone. Yeah, we got to go up there and get us an ice cream  cone.  Finchum Were you traveling by car by that time?  Beasley Dad bought an old Model T Ford. That   s what he was driving.  Finchum It still wouldn   t go too fast?  Beasley Well, it would go fast enough. There   d be a lot of people saved now if  that dadgum speed limit was down to sixty-miles an hour. I don   t know  what it is. What is the speed limit now?  23  Bishop Sixty-five.  Finchum Sixty-five. Most places it   s sixty-five.  Beasley They don   t go by that.  Finchum Oh no   Beasley They go straight on. Then they have a wreck, wind up somewhere, have  a wreck.  Bishop Did you ever think you   d make it to a hundred?  Beasley I never did think anything about it. I never did think anything about it.  Bishop You   ll soon be a hundred and five?  Beasley Well, the sixth of November. And over there at Lone Grove (Senior  Center), you go over there Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and eat  dinner for two dollars. I mean you get a real good dinner. Every other  Friday, they have brunch. It   s three dollars.  Finchum Do you go?  Beasley Huh?  Finchum Do you go?  Beasley When I   m down at Frances   , I go with them but from here I don   t.  Finchum When did you give up driving?  Beasley When I couldn   t see. When it got to where I couldn   t see to drive.  Bishop What do you typically do in a day?  Beasley Well, when it   s where you can work outside, I work outside.  Bishop What are some of the things you do?  Beasley What are some of the things I do?  Bishop When you work outside?  24  Beasley Well, I take my hoe and clean out a strip about that wide (gestures) this  side of the fence out there. Maybe clean out yonder around the barn. I  have plenty to do. That old commode and thing that   s setting out there,  that was brought out of the house, I set down on it a lot of times. Of  course I   ve got a chair I take with me, too, out there. I work a little bit  and sit down a little bit. Like down there at Rio Vista, they had  Mexicans, Mexicans, and Mexicans working. Mr. Hildebrandt, he was  the boss and the owner. So one day he was just out driving around you  know, seeing everything. He could talk Spanish just as good as the next  Spanish guy. He came to these three guys and they were all setting  down in the shade, and Mr. Hildebrandt said,    Ya   ll not working?    He  said something. I don   t know just what he said. They said,    They don   t  pay much. They don   t worky much.    That   s what they told Mr.  Hildebrandt. (Laughs) Mr Hildebrandt, he couldn   t have hardly keep   I  guess he, he might have said something, I don   t know, back to them you  know in Spanish. (Laughs) They told him,    Well, they don   t a pay  much, and we don   t worky much.  Yeah, I kept the store there for three  years.  Finchum What kind of store?  Beasley Grocery store.  Finchum Grocery store.  Beasley I waited on all of them Mexicans.  Finchum Do you know Spanish?  Beasley No. A word or two. Como esta? A word or two, but no. I don   t know  Spanish.  Finchum I don   t either. You   re doing better than I if you know that. (Laughter)  Let   s back up. Do you remember much about the Depression?  Beasley Well, I remember if you had a hog to sell, I know we had one one time  and you just got four dollars for it. Four dollars   all we got for that big  hog.  Finchum Well, living on the farm, could you tell much     Beasley But that wasn   t when I was still at home though.  Finchum Okay.  25  Beasley See, we always had lots of cattle at home, you know. Dad always had  lots of cattle, and of course we always had plenty to eat.  Finchum Your mother had a garden?  Beasley Oh yes. Oh yeah, we always had a good garden. One time I was out in  the hen house to gather up the eggs and I heard a little chicken a  hollering. I knew we didn   t have a hen a setting, so I got to looking  around. I seen this little booger. He had hatched out of the nest egg.  Yeah, he had hatched out of the nest egg. Well, I got him and took him  to the house. Momma crumbled up a little bit of cornbread, and he went  to eating. He went to eating that cornbread. Had a little lid there or  something another, and Momma give him a drink. He knew how to  drink and everything too. He ate it. That   s the way we raised that little  chicken.  Well, there was a little, had at one time a house up there about a quarter  of the mile from the house or not that far. One year, Momma had the  garden up there because it was a good garden spot. Well, that little old  chicken, of course it didn   t take him long to get pretty good size, and he  followed you everywhere you went. He would follow Momma up to the  garden. Me and Dutch usually went along too. When Momma would  make the furrows, you know, to plant something another, well he was  right along there just a talking up a storm. If there happened to be a bug  or a worm or anything, he got it. (Laughs) So he was, like I said, he  grew up.  One time, we were going down to Ms. Bostic   s down there. They lived  just a mile exactly from us. That chicken, one evening, Momma said,     Let   s go down to Ms. Bostic   s awhile.    Well, of course we was ready  to go, me and Dutch. So here we go, we cut across the field, little bit  nearer. We cut across the field. Well, we heard something, looked  around and there was that chicken. He was following us, but we didn   t  know it. When he would get tired, why, he would set down and rest.  Well, of course, me and Dutch would pick him up and carry him. We   d  carry him a good piece, then we   d put him down and let him walk some  more. Well, when he got tired he would set down, again. Well, of  course, (laughs) that   s the way it was all the way down to Ms. Bostic   s,  and all the way back home. We had to carry him, nearly all the way,  because he couldn   t walk too far until he would be give out and set  down. (Laughs)  Finchum He became your pet?  26  Beasley Oh yeah, he was a pet. You couldn   t get out and go nowhere without  him right along with you. He would just be a chipping, chipping, I call  it talking. Every step of the way, why, he   d just be a talking up a storm.  Finchum Was it a hen or a rooster?  Beasley It was a rooster.  Bishop What was his name?  Beasley But we had a little hen, little brown hen, and how come her to get to  doing that I don   t know, but one day she came here to the, out here on  the porch. Momma had the quilt box here behind the door. She would  come there at that door, and she would take on and take on and walk.  Just kept a walking just like that (gestures), backwards and forwards.  One day, Momma went to the door and said,    What in the world do you  want?    Well, when Momma opened the door, she came in. She come  right in right there and jumped up on the old quilt box. Momma had two  or three quilts stacked up there. She   d get right up there and lay an egg.  Get right down and want right back outside. She wouldn   t be in there  five minutes until she   d have that egg laid, down, and out. Every day,  every day by eleven o   clock, you could set your clock by it, why, here  she was wanting in. Then we would open the door, she would come  right in and jump up there, lay that egg, then she was out and gone.  (Laughter) Three hundred and sixty-five eggs a year. She laid one every  day.  We had one guinea hen, and she laid in the nest with the chickens.  Yeah, she laid in the nest with the chickens. Me and Dutch, we thought  that guinea egg was something else. One morning Dutch would eat the  guinea egg, and next time I   d eat the guinea egg. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, what happened to the rooster?  Beasley Oh, he was still there whenever I left.  Finchum He didn   t become dinner?  Beasley No, oh no   Finchum Did you name him?  Beasley Dick. We called him Dick.  Finchum Dick.  27  Beasley He knew his name too. Yeah, he knew his name.  Finchum That   s pretty cool. Did your mother sell the eggs?  Beasley No, yeah, we sold eggs. Momma had a great big blue and white stewer.  Bout that big around and about that deep. (Gestures) About every other  day, me and Dutch would take them eggs to the Nebo store. We   d  always go barefooted of course and carried them, both of us would  carry that stewer. Each one of us would have a bucket of eggs in the  other hand to carry. That would be over two miles, where the store was.  Howe   s Store. We   d take them eggs off, and of course you didn   t get  but bout five cents a dozen for them. A lot of the times, Momma would  tell us that if there was anything she needed, she would just tell us to get  that and then we could get what we wanted to get with the rest of it.  One time, we had enough to get enough material to make Momma a  dress. Yeah, we always spent it. We always got a box of Post Toasties  though, because we thought they were the best things ever was, was  them Post Toasties. (Laughs)  Finchum I   m not sure what that is. I will have to look it up   Beasley Post Toasties? Well, that   s cereal.  Finchum Oh that   s cereal. Okay.  Beasley Why yeah  It   s cereal. It may not go with Post Toasties, the name of it,  but that   s what it was then.  Finchum Not candy, you wouldn   t get candy?  Beasley Oh, I don   t know if I ever got any candy or not. The Garner boys, they  lived right there, next house down. Every time they went   none of  them, Uncle Bill, they wasn   t no kin to us or nothing, but his wife died  when Ed was just two years old. He raised them four boys all by  himself and worked and worked and made a living for them four boys.  One time they got sick and he killed a hen and was cooking that hen,  had it hanging over the fireplace to cook while they were sleeping. Well  when it went to getting done, why, he would taste of it to see if it was  getting done or anything. Well, I guess, when it got done, he had tasted  it so much that there wasn   t anything left. (Laughs) So he ate that, then  he went and killed another hen, so he would have it ready when his kids  woke up. So they   d have some broth or something to give them, you  know, (laughs) and everything.  Well, of course none of them never did marry. There were four boys.  Doff worked for Henry Kroscal is who he worked for. Then Ed, and  28  Jim, and John, they always farmed the place they lived on. They didn   t  live very much further than, wasn   t no piece from where they lived  from us. Well, whenever they would get a bunch of eggs, why, they  would either take them to the Drake store or sometime they would go to  Nebo store. Well, here   d come Ed up through the little old pasture  slinging those arms just like that. (Gestures) Come up to ask Momma if  me and Dutch could go to the store with them. Momma would say,     Well if they want to go they can go.    So of course we always wanted  to go. Well, they would buy us all the candy, apples and stuff like that  you know, (laughs) all the time.  And every time they caught a opossum, Jim cooked it. So here   d come  Ed up there slinging them arms just like that and asked Momma if me  and Dutch could come and eat dinner with them, they were having  possum and sweet potatoes.    Well, if they want to go, they can.    Well,  of course we always wanted to go. We   d go down there, and Jim could  make just as good of biscuits as you ever ate. He made biscuits three  times a day. He done it. Jim is the one that did the cooking. I know he  made biscuits three times a day. Morning, noon, and night.  Finchum What does a possum taste like?  Beasley Good. I   ve even cooked opossum myself. Some people,    Well, I  wouldn   t eat one of them for nothing.    I don   t care whether they eat it  or not, but it   s good. Every time Ed and Jim and them got a possum,  they cooked it. Then Ed would come up there and ask Momma. They  called her Mrs. Renegar, they called us the babies. He called us the  babies,    Can the babies come and eat dinner with them. We are having  possum and sweet potatoes.    Course I had them good biscuits and  something else, of course, something else besides just possum. Momma  would say,    If they want to go, they can.    So, of course we always  wanted to go, you know.  Finchum Sure.  Beasley That   s what we   d have, possum and sweet potatoes and biscuits, and I  don   t know what else.  Finchum Maybe that possum is why you are still here?  Beasley Maybe. A lot of people,    Oh, I wouldn   t eat that. No way would I eat  that.     Bishop I   ve had it.  Beasley Well, it   s good. I don   t care what anybody says.  29  Finchum Well, would they do turtle soup and     Beasley Oh, they never killed a turtle.  Finchum No turtle?  Beasley No.  Finchum Rabbits?  Beasley No.  Finchum No.  Bishop Raccoons?  Beasley They might would have dressed a rabbit out if they ever had one, but  they didn   t.  Finchum How about go fishing?  Beasley Oh now down there at Oil Creek at the bridge, there was a little hole of  water not very big. That   s where we would go fishing at. (Laughs) Of  course, Ed and Jim would all go with us. All we ever caught out of there  was just little bitty perch. I remember one time we caught a little catfish  about that long. (Gestures) You know, perch has about the best flavor of  any fish I ever ate. Perch     Finchum I haven   t had any perch.  Beasley But then they have lots of bones in them. You have to be awful careful  and not get a bone.  Finchum Right.  Bishop Well, do you have anything on your bucket list that you still want to do?  Anything you always wanted to do, but never had the chance to, but  you   d still like to     Beasley Why no, I just stay here and do whatever I have to do here. Maybe go  down Frances stay for a few days when I have to   I go down there to  the doctor. I go down there to Dr. Venquis. He   s from the Philippines.  You can   t get a doctor now unless they   re from some other country. Dr.  Venquis, he   s from the Philippines.  30  I had an appointment for the eighth of April. Well, his nurse was sick  then. Then, they put me up to the thirteenth of April. Well, then he was  sick. The doctor was sick. So then they put it up to the twenty-third of  April. So then   s when I seen him, the twenty-third of April. He said he  wasn   t really sick, but he had been sawing a limb from the house cause  it was getting over on the house, and he was up there like this,  (gestures) he said a sawing and all that sawdust was coming right down  in his face. He didn   t have his face covered up and it just got covered  with this sawdust and had given him something. I don   t know what he  said now. He said there were for two days there that he just couldn   t  hardly do anything, so they called and said he was sick. Then they give  me the appointment for the twenty-third. That   s when I went and seen  him. He was telling us all about that. (Laughs)  Bishop Do you have any advice for someone who would want to live one  hundred or more years? What advice would you give someone?  Beasley I don   t know nothing, only work. Over there at Lone Grove one day  there was a bunch up there, wanted to talk to me and ask me this and  that.    What did I do to live so long?    I told them,    Work.    That   s all I  knew to tell them, was to work. That   s all I ever done. Good night   Bishop How did you celebrate your hundredth birthday?  Beasley How did I celebrate it?  Bishop Yeah.  Beasley Well, had a party for me down there at the Dickson Senior Citizen  building. That   s where we   ve had it every year. They   ve already got it  reserved for this time. (Laughter)  Bishop Now, if history were written today, what would you want it to say about  you? How would you want to be remembered?  Beasley How do I want to be remembered?  Bishop Uh-huh.  Beasley Well, lord, I don   t know. I don   t know nothing, only just I worked all  my life and loved it.  Finchum Daddy   s little cowboy.  Beasley That   s right. I   ve been Dad   s cowboy ever since I was knee high to a  duck. Been riding a horse, me and Dutch   when Vera went to school,  31  why, she stayed at the Lansfords because they had a little girl just the  same age and same size and same grade and everything as Vera was.  Well, so Vera stayed there during the week and went to school with her  because they didn   t live no piece from the schoolhouse.  So Dad would saddle up our horses. My horse was a sorrel with a long  mane and tail that touched the ground, and Dad   s was a dark bay with a  long mane and tail that touch the ground. Well, on Friday evenings, Dad  would saddle up our horses. Stick me up there on mine, I was just a  little bitty kid. We would go and pick up Vera, and then we would take  her back on Sunday evening. We rode them horses. They were both  about the same size. Just as pretty a horses as you ever seen.  One day, somebody asked Dad, see I always went with him horseback  and had on my overalls and cap, hat. They asked Dad one day, one  time, somebody did, I don   t know who now, was that a girl or a boy.  (Laughs) Dad told them it was a girl, but I was his cowboy.  Finchum You had a good relationship with your father.  Beasley Oh yeah. We rode twice a week, every Friday and Sunday, taking and  going and getting Vera and taking her back. I used to could ride good as  the next guy.  Finchum I believe it.  Beasley Well, I could. I could. I used to be stout. I mean stout. After I got big  enough to harness up the mules, why, I harnessed up the mules. For  years we just had a sulky plow. That just turned over one      Phone rings   Beasley What was I saying?  Finchum A sulky plow?  Beasley For a long time, just had that sulky plow. It just turned over. It was a  riding plow, but just turned over one furr. You used three mules to pull  it. Later on, Dad bought a gang plow. Turned over two furrs, but it took  four mules to pull it. Well, after I got big enough where I could harness  up the mules, why, I harnessed up the mules to go to the field and plow.  Dad didn   t have to do nothing, because I knew how to do it and done it.  Heck, yeah  Then, whenever I   d get it all plowed, I   d hook the mules to  the harrow, course I had to, twelve-foot wide, two inches thick board,  that laid across the double section harrow. Well, I   d stand on that board  and harrow everything that I plowed, then take the drill and fill it up  32  with oats and plant it. I did all of that by myself. I knew how to do it  too.  Finchum Before you were sixteen?  Beasley Yeah. Before I was sixteen. Oh yeah. Lord yeah. Like I say, I used to be  stout. Me and Dutch one time, we wanted a ring, so you know we used  to get catalogs. Get one from Sears and Roebuck, one from  Montgomery Ward. So we was looking in there, and we found these  rings, me and Dutch, a dollar and sixty-five cents. Well, we ordered  one. I   ve still got mine. Course it   s worn way down. That   s the reason  why I don   t wear it anymore because I didn   t want to wear it plum in  two. I   ve still got that ring. I   ve had it I guess ninety-something years.  Course when we got them, we had to wear them on our big finger. We  had a twine string on the ring and then bring it down here and tied it  around the wrist so we wouldn   t lose it, until we got big enough, our  fingers got big enough, to where we didn   t have to have that string.  Finchum That   s pretty smart.  Beasley Well, yeah.  Finchum Yeah.  Beasley Them rings just cost a dollar and sixty-five cents. Mine says solid gold  in it but Dutch   s didn   t.  Finchum You chose wiser.  Beasley Huh?  Finchum You chose wiser?  Beasley Well, I didn   t know it.  Finchum Just luck. Just luck?  Beasley The one I got was solid gold.  Finchum You can remember dates really well.  Beasley In that. Well yeah. I know all of my grandkids    names and birthdays.  Finchum Well were you good at math?  33  Beasley Not algebra. I never did learn algebra. Mr. McGibney would call me     Ivory Top Bone Head.    (Laughter)  Bishop What about reading? Do you enjoy reading?  Beasley Oh, I could read. I didn   t enjoy much of anything like that cause I liked  to plow, feed the cattle and stuff like that. I made my first pie when I  was twelve years old though. It turned out to be real good. I had to  make pies from then on.  Bishop What was it?  Beasley It was chocolate.  Bishop Chocolate.  Beasley I even had to make pies for the threshers when they come. Then one  time Momma was sick and couldn   t go down to Ms. Bostic   s when the  thresher was there. See, Ms. Bostic would come up to the house and  help Momma get dinner. Well, Momma would always go down there  and help her get dinner. Well, Momma was sick one time, so she sent  me. Well, first thing Ms. Bostic done,    Ruby you   re going to have to  make the pies.    Well, course I always have a cake made, you know.  Make about three pies, and sometimes there wouldn   t be any of it left,  any pies left. After I learned how to make pies, I had to make them from  then on.  Used to, every Saturday evening, why, then   s when we would make a  cake and couple of pies to have for Sunday dinner. Mr. and Ms. Bostic  and their kids would come up to the house. Well, me and Dutch and her  kids, they had Perry, Wilson and Little Joe. Well we all had on overalls  and things, and all of us out there playing, you couldn   t hardly tell us a  part. They always brought their   they had a pony. It was a grey pony.  That was the gentlest thing ever was, it was like a cow. You could just  crawl under her or anything. Hang onto her tail or anything, and she  wouldn   t move. After we would get through with dinner, then they  would let us go ride the pony. All five of us kids would get on that  pony, bareback, and course we just rode her around there. We didn   t get  out and go nowhere or nothing, just ride her around there. All five of us  kids on that pony.  Finchum At one time?  Beasley At one time.  Finchum That poor pony.  34  Beasley Well, that pony, we weren   t big enough to hurt her or nothing. All five  of us would get on her. Now that   s how little we were, you know, to get  on her and ride her bareback and everything.  Finchum Well, by dinner you mean lunch, what we call lunch now? The noon  meal.  Beasley Yeah, it   s dinner.  Finchum Dinner.  Beasley Breakfast, dinner, and supper. That   s the way it   s been all my life and  that   s the way it still is.  Finchum Okay.  Beasley For me     Finchum Sure.  Beasley (Laughs) Well, that   s the way it   s been all our life. When we would get  in from school, we would have to run, had to hurry up cause we didn   t  get out until four o   clock. Books took up at eight and got out at four.  We had to step on it to get down there. We had to step on it to get back,  so we run in and get our clothes changed, and carry in enough wood for  Momma the next day, for the heater and the cook stove. We had a big  Home Comfort Range. That   s the kind of stove we had. Dad give five  hundred dollars for it. The guy came around showing those stoves. He  had a little one with him. Boy that was the cutest little stove you ever  seen. He said the big stove would be just exactly like this one. It was.  Dad give five hundred for that stove.  Finchum That   s a lot of money in those days.  Beasley It was a good one. It had a reservoir on it, you know, and everything.  Fill up that full of water and you had hot water all the time.  Finchum You   ve had a fascinating life.  Beasley Well, like I say, I   ve worked all my life and that   s all I know. That   s  what people asked,    What   d you do to live so long?    I told them,     Worked.    Well, that   s all I know.  Finchum And it worked.  35  Beasley It   s worked. I still work.  Finchum I think we will close and say thank you for sharing your stories with us  today. You   ve been great.  Beasley Well, that probably ain   t all of them either. (Laughter)  Finchum We   ll have to come back for another round.  -------  -------
