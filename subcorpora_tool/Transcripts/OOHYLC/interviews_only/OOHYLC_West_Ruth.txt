Finchum Good. So were you born at home or in town?  West Oh at home.  Finchum On a farm?  West No, it was in town. We didn   t live on a farm, we lived in town.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  5  West My father was a truck driver.  Finchum And your mother stayed at home?  West Definitely.  Finchum How many brothers and sisters do you have?  West I had four brothers and two sisters.  Finchum Big family.  West Big family.  Finchum And where were you in that order?  West Well there was three boys older, then it was me, and then it was twins,  boy and a girl, and then a girl.  Finchum So in the middle there.  West I was number four.  Finchum Well describe the house that you grew up in.  West Just a plain old country-style house with three rooms and a   we called  a side room where we had stored our groceries and stuff. Just a plain old  everyday-type house. (Laughs)  Finchum Was it two stories or one?  West One-story.  Finchum So you had to share your bedroom with     West Oh definitely.  Finchum How many were in your room?  West Well I had   there was two beds in my room. So it was three of us in  one bedroom.  Finchum And how was it heated?  West With a woodstove.  6  Finchum And no air-conditioning I would think?  West No, a coal oil lamp.  Finchum Okay, where did you go to school?  West What?  Finchum Where did you go to school?  West We went to a grade school that was within walking distance of where I  lived. It was just a school from beginners to sixth grade. And then after  that you had to go to what they called junior high and that was seventh,  eighth, and ninth grade. Then you was in high school.  Finchum And it was Durant High School?  West Yes.  Finchum What year did you graduate?  West Well I never did finish school.  Finchum Didn   t finish high school?  West No.  Finchum Okay, how far did you get?  West To the eighth grade.  Finchum Back in those days that   s pretty good.  West Yes, definitely.  Finchum And would you walk?  West Oh yes, definitely. We always walked. We was in walking distance.  Finchum And what about lunchtime?  West Well, fortunately I was close enough to where I could go home for  lunch, because we had an hour for lunch, and went home, ate, went  back to school.  7  Finchum Was it a one-room or a two-room school?  West Oh it was a four-room school.  Finchum Oh, bigger. And did your family have a car or would you travel by  wagon early in those     West No, we had a truck.  Finchum If he   s a truck driver I guess he would, wouldn   t he?  West Yeah. (Laughs)  Finchum Connect the dots here. (Laughs) What would you do for fun as a young  girl?  West Oh we just had to make up our own things to play. We jumped rope,  and ran, hide-and-seek, and just   Annie Over and just those kind of  games was things that we played and had a good time doing. We didn   t  know any better.  Finchum Well you lived through the Depression. Do you have any memories from  that time period?  West Well, we was always poor so it wasn   t much different. We had plenty to  eat and clothes on our back so     Finchum Was church an important part?  West Oh yes. Yes, we lived   and there was a church in the neighborhood and  the church provided a lot of activities for the children. So church was  very important then and now in my live.  Finchum Did your parents go with you?  West Part of the time, not all the time, just part of the time.  Finchum Did they make you go when they didn   t?  West No, we didn   t   the kids in those days didn   t think about being made go,  that was our activities. We was poor and didn   t have other things. The  church provided weenie roasts, and hikes, and things. So the church was  very important as religion, and as activities, and meeting your friend.  Finchum What religion was it?  8  West Presbyterian.  Finchum Presbyterian, okay. Was Durant a very big town in your youth?  West It was fairly good sized. To me it was a fairly good sized town.  Naturally, as of now thinking back it wasn   t that big, but it was the  county seat.  Finchum And a movie theater?  West Theater? Yes. That was   if you had a dime, well you got to go to the  theater. That was our Saturday afternoon.  Finchum Silent movies?  West Yes.  Finchum Would you have a part-time job while you were in school?  West Not while I was in school, no.  Finchum So when you finished the eighth grade what did you do?  West I worked for people in the house, cleaning peoples    houses, or washing  their dishes, and sweeping their floors, and just general housework.  Finchum And then when did you get married?  West Oh, good Lord, back (Laughter)    I can   t remember what year that was.  Granddaughter Hello, how are you? Hey, I didn   t know you were having a party   West Yes I am. (Laughs) That   s my granddaughter.  Slankard She   s having an interview.  Bishop We   re from OSU.  West That   s my oldest granddaughter.  Finchum We were asking when you got married. Or let   s back up then, how did  you meet your husband? Let   s start there.  West He lived in the neighborhood. (Laughs)  Finchum Okay.  9  West And that   s the way I met him.  Finchum How old were you when you got married?  West Well   goodness gracious, I don   t know. I can   t remember dates.  Slankard She   s been married twice.  Finchum That   s okay.  West Thirty-six I guess.  Slankard You got married the first time in    35 because Bob was born in    36, and  the second time you were married in    39 because I was born in    40.  Finchum There you go.  West Okay, I can   t remember those dates.  Finchum After you worked in the home, what happened next? Where did you  work next?  West Well I never did do any more work until after the kids all got in school  and all. Of course I had three children, and then I went to work for the  school as a cook in a junior high school. That only lasted twenty years  and I retired from it. (Laughs)  Finchum Only? (Laughter) Fed a lot of kids during that time.  West I sure did because we had a little less than 1,000 kids enrolled in the  junior high. I had charge of the meats and the vegetables so I did plenty  of cooking.  Finchum Would you cook like turkeys and chickens and things like that?  West Oh yeah. Whole turkeys, and whole hens, and     Finchum None of this processed stuff?  West Oh no, no, no. Everything was from the   the first day I worked I went  home and told my husband, that was before they put me as a cook, how  many pounds of potatoes I peeled. He said,    How long did it take you?     I said,    About five minutes.    He said,    How come?    I had an electric  peeler, so all I had to do was put potatoes in there and flip the button,  10  but he didn   t know that. (Laughs) So he thought I was really peeling a  lot of potatoes.  Finchum Well how many would you have to do?  West Right now I don   t know how many pounds at a time because we had a  little less than 1,000 kids enrolled. Now they all did not eat at school. A  lot of them brought their lunches and some lived close enough to go  home for lunch. But we had a lot of kids. When I   d make bean chowder,  which is their favorite, I made thirty gallons of bean chowder.  Finchum I don   t know what that is. What goes into bean chowder?  West Hamburger meat and onions and garlic and just   you cook your meat,  and you cook your beans, and then you mix it, and put your tomato  sauce in it, and it   s     Finchum Sounds good.  West Oh the kids think it   s the grandest thing there is, and I   d make thirty  gallons. Three big pots of bean chowder and then I   d usually have  approximately maybe a gallon and half left out of the thirty gallons  because every kid loved bean chowder. It was just     Finchum Serve it with cornbread?  West No, they like crackers with their bean chowder. It was just like a chili  with beans in it, you know, on that order.  Finchum Still sounds good, and you did that for twenty years?  West Yes ma   am.  Finchum What was the school?  West Clinton Junior High School.  Finchum Was it in Clinton?  West No, in Durant.  Slankard No, in Tulsa. She lived in Tulsa at the time.  Finchum Okay.  Slankard And Clinton was in the Red Fork area over there.  11  West Yes that   s right. I was still back in Durant (laughs) years ago.  Finchum When did you move to Tulsa?  West Well, I don   t know.  Slankard It had to have been in about    41 because I was a baby.  Finchum Before World War II?  West I can   t remember those dates.  Slankard I was born in    40 and I was real little when they moved to Tulsa.  Finchum I   ll ask one more date then, when did you retire from school, from  cooking?  West At age sixty-five I hung up my apron.  Slankard In    77.  Finchum You hung up your apron?  West Yeah.  Finchum Did you keep it?  West No. (Laughs) Who would want an old school apron? (Laughs)  Bishop Cooking for all those kids, did you like to cook at home?  West Yeah, because I   d been doing our cooking at home, you know. On bean  chowder day instead of thirty pounds of beans, at home I   d use two  cups of beans. (Laughs) So that was it.  Finchum What brought you to Tulsa?  West My husband   s work.  Finchum What did he do?  West He was a mechanic on heavy duty trucks.  Finchum So Durant   s a little bit of ways from here?  12  West Yeah.  Finchum How was Tulsa when you moved? Quite bigger than Durant I know,  but     West Yeah, it was bigger, but I just accepted it and didn   t think anything  about it.  Finchum Did you get around by bus or did you have your own car?  West I stayed home more than I went out anywhere. (Laughs) If I went  shopping I   d go by bus.  Slankard She did not come from Durant straight to Tulsa. They came to Krebs, a  little town out from McAlester in    41. It was in    52 I think,    51 or    52,  that they moved from McAlester to here.  Finchum Was your husband in the military?  West No.  Finchum Anyone in your family in World War II?  Slankard Gene   Eugene.  West Yeah, one brother.  Finchum One brother.  Slankard I think he was the only one. He was in the Navy.  Finchum Do you remember when he came back?  West Honey, those dates   don   t remember them at all.  Finchum Well, once you were married what would you do for fun?  West (Laughs) Poor people don   t do a lot of things.  Finchum Play cards or go dancing or     West Yeah we played cards, and sat around and talked with neighbors and  friends, and drink a cup of coffee, and thought we had a good time.  (Laughs)  Finchum And probably did.  13  West Yeah.  Finchum Was music an important part of your life at any point?  West Well I never was talented for music, but I loved music and all. We  always had a Victrola with records that you could play, but as far as  being talented for music, I wasn   t.  Finchum Would you go to dances when you were dating?  West No. My mother didn   t approve of dancing and fortunately I didn   t  dance.  Finchum Were your parents from Oklahoma?  West Oh goodness no. I think one of them was from Arkansas, but I   m not  sure about the other. Because back then I thought everybody was from  Oklahoma, you know. We didn   t travel like we do now. We didn   t get  on a plane and fly. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s true.  Bishop You didn   t travel back then, but did you ever travel later on in life?  West No not   we didn   t do much   we was poor people. We didn   t travel.  Bishop I mean as you got older and got married.  West Oh yes, I   ve been a lot of nice places. I   ve gone to a lot, to Hawaii, and  I   ve gone to Canada. I   ve been inside of Mexico, but Hawaii was the  highlight of any place I   ve been and all.  Bishop What made that trip to Hawaii so special?  West Because it was first time I   d ever been anywhere to speak of and out  any distance. We just had a good time.  Bishop Was there anything you remember in particular about Hawaii?  West Oh just the area around there and walking and seeing the different  things in Hawaii that made it special. That was it.  Bishop Did you travel alone?  West No. My son and his wife, I went with them.  14  Finchum Was the first plane ride kind of scary?  West It was exciting.  Finchum Exciting.  West But I wasn   t scared, I don   t think.  Finchum Excited is a better word.  West Yeah, it was exciting to go somewhere and do something.  Finchum Well let   s go back a little bit; you said you had coal oil lamps?  West Coal oil lamps.  Finchum Do you remember getting electricity?  West Oh my goodness yes  We was the richest people when we got  electricity. (Laughs) Oh yes.  Finchum What was the first thing your parents bought that used electricity?  Refrigerator or washing machine or     West Oh the washing machine, definitely washing machine.  Finchum Before the washing machine, how did your mother do laundry?  West On the rubboard. (Laughs)  Finchum Hard on the knuckles?  West Yeah.  Slankard They had a well out the backdoor. They did not have inside plumbing.  Finchum The bathroom was outside?  West Oh yes, definitely. We didn   t even have running water. We had a well  that you drawed water out of when I was younger. Then after I was  married I had better things.  Finchum How about bath time?  15  West Oh get you a washtub, and get you some warm water, put it in, run  everybody out of the kitchen, and close the door. (Laughter)  Bishop You took your bath in the kitchen?  West Sure, close to the stove where it was warm in the wintertime. You could  get the others out of the house, close up the kitchen door for your  privacy.  Finchum How often?  West Well everybody had to have at least one bath a week. Of course if you  played out in the dirt you had one every day. (Laughs)  Finchum Would you have your own water or would you have to share it?  West Oh we had our own water, it was well water, you had to draw it.  Finchum But for the bath?  West It was same thing. Put the water on the stove and get it warm, put it in  your tub.  Finchum Still kind of cold in the wintertime?  West Well yeah, it wasn   t as comfortable as it is nowadays, but we survived.  Finchum Sure. Well did your mother sew?  West Yes, made everything we wore.  Finchum Where would she get her fabric?  West At the dry-good store.  Finchum Would she use feed sacks, flour sacks?  West Sure. You didn   t let anything go to waste.  Finchum Would they have their own chickens?  West Chicken and eggs.  Finchum In town though?  16  West Well, it wasn   t a big city. It was a little town. In that area you could  have a cow and chickens and all. It wasn   t a town. It was just a little  poor peoples    town.  Slankard They had a garden, fruit trees.  Finchum Had a garden? Your mother canned?  West By the dozens of jars.  Finchum With having to feed seven, eight, nine people, she probably canned a  lot.  West Well, we just fed the family, but we canned, she canned everything that  was eatable.  Finchum Did you have a cellar?  West Oh yes, a storm cellar. That   s where we stored our canned food.  Finchum Okay.  West Canned stuff.  Finchum Would she quilt?  West Yes.  Finchum Did she teach you how?  West She sewed. She made all of our clothes, and yes.  Finchum And did you learn how?  West Yes I did.  Finchum Did you make your girls?  West Yes.  Finchum Those were the days of polyester?  Slankard Yes. (Laughter) Yes it was.  Finchum A different way of sewing. It moved didn   t it?  17  West Yes. Well aren   t you going to run out? (Laughs)  Finchum You   re doing fine  Do you remember getting your first television?  West Oh yes.  Finchum It was a pretty big deal?  West Yes, we didn   t have one for ages, and we had a neighbor and she said,     Don   t you believe in television?    My mother said,    Yes, but we can   t  afford one.     Finchum Did you have a telephone in the home?  West Not for a long time, no.  Finchum When you did, was it a party line?  West I   m sure it was. Off now, I don   t remember.  Finchum Would you go to sporting events: basketball, football, that sort of thing?  West A sporting event?  Finchum Yes.  West You had to watch baseball and football, but that   s about all I knew  anything about.  Finchum Well did you ever think you would live to 100?  West Oh, that never entered my mind.  Finchum How old were your parents?  West Oh honey, I don   t remember how old they are. Is this all important?  Finchum Well I   m just trying to see if you   re the first one in the family to get to  100...  Slankard Yes, she is.  Finchum    is the question. You   re the first one?  West Oh definitely.  18  Finchum What do you think your secret is to living to 100?  West I don   t think it   s a secret. I think the Lord just had a reason for me to  live and that   s all I can say.  Finchum It may be the bean chowder.  West No.  Finchum No?  West I don   t think so. (Laughter)  Slankard Her parents lived to their eighties.  Finchum Okay, so there   s some longevity genes in there.  Slankard Yes, her oldest brother was in his nineties when he died. All of her  family has  reached  eighties and nineties.  Finchum What would you do for exercise?  West Go hiking and     Finchum After you were married?  West For exercise?  Finchum Yes.  West Honey, after I was married I didn   t have to worry about exercise. I had  kids to take care of, and laundry, and housework, and     Finchum And while you worked you were on your feet.  West Yes, definitely.  Bishop I want to know when you were growing up, what were holidays like?  West What was holidays like? Oh, our family would get together, and  everybody put their food together, and have a big meal, and kids  romped and played ball or whatever. It was family stuff that poor  people done.  Bishop Did you celebrate Christmas?  19  West Oh, goodness yes. Course we may not get very much, but Christmas  was very important.  Bishop What would you get for a present?  West Always, we girls, always had to have a doll and a set of little toy dishes  that we could play house with. Such things as that.  Bishop Did you have a favorite holiday?  West Well, birthdays and Christmas was   and Easter. Easter was very  important, because we hid Easter eggs.  Bishop How did you dye the eggs back then?  West Goodness. As far as I can remember you could buy dye, little packages  of dye to dye your eggs. Before that, I don   t know.  Finchum Who would kill the chickens when it was time for that?  West Well my father usually did and my mother, (laughs) I can remember my  mother talking about   the neighbor would kill a chicken. She   d wring  its neck and my mother thought,    Oh I can do that.    She said she wrung  it and that chicken just kept going around and around. Never did break  its neck. (Laughs)  Finchum So your dad had to do it then?  West Yes.  Finchum Growing up, we had a pulley bone. They would cut the chicken so you   d  have a pulley bone.  West Oh yes, and you had to pull the pulley bone and see who was going to  be the lucky one.  Finchum Now you can   t find those unless you get a whole chicken.  West No.  Finchum Well is there anything left on your list that you want to do?  West No, just visit with my granddaughter from out of town.  Finchum That   s my clue to shut this off, isn   t it?  20  West Yeah. (Laughs) She came from Missouri, just got here so     Bishop Just a couple more. When history is written, what do you want it to say  about you?  West I   m just an old girl, 100-year-old girl (laughs) that   s got three wonderful  children and some great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren  that I   m very proud of, and I hope they are proud of me. You can ask  the oldest one. (Laughs)  Bishop Did you ever have to take care of the grandkids?  West No, they came and visited, but I never had to take care of them.  Bishop Well, that   s what I mean. They come and visit?  West They just come up to visit and all, but as far as having to take care of  them, I haven   t had to.  Finchum You just got to spoil them.  West Yeah.  Bishop Well I want to know, today, just kind of thinking of being 100, what   s a  typical day like for you?  West Well, I haven   t been 100 that many days. (Laughs) A lot of days I don   t  feel good, I have a very bad   it   s not a headache, it   s a   I don   t know  what it is. I woke up with it this morning, but it fortunately didn   t last  long. It   s just an inner ear infection they said, I don   t know, but     Bishop Well what time do you usually get up in the morning?  West Well, the lights come on at six o   clock. You don   t have to get up till  you want to, unless you have to have someone take care of you, then  they   ll get you up. But where you do for yourself, you can get up  anytime you want to.  Bishop And what time do you usually go to bed?  West Oh that   s a silly question. You go to bed because everybody else is in  bed and the lights are out and you either sit here by yourself until you  think,    Oh well, might as well go to bed,    so   I try not to go to bed  before eight thirty.  21  Bishop When you wake up do you have any rituals? Some people like to have  morning coffee with a newspaper     West I wake up and wash your face and brush your teeth and get your clothes  on. (Laughs)  Bishop Ready to go.  West Yeah, a long ways to the dining room. (Laughs)  Finchum During the day do you read or watch television?  West I used to read quite a bit, but I   m completely blind in this eye and I  can   t see very much out of this one. So my reading   I   ll get the paper.  One of the men that comes over to our Sunday services brings me the  Sunday paper and I see the headlines and that   s   but I   m just so blind  now that I can   t enjoy reading.  Finchum Okay.  West And I watch a little television, but television   s just like the reading. I  have to have it a little bit loud to hear, because my hearing   s not good  and my eyesight   s   well, it   s getting pathetic and all so   a lot of times  I just sit here in this beautiful chair.  Bishop Do you have a motto you live by?  West Well, the same old thing: do unto others as you   d want them to do unto  you. I try to be nice to everybody and fortunately I haven   t had any  problem there at all. When you get this age, you don   t have much  choice of what you do or you don   t do. (Laughs) Surely that   s the end  of the story.  Finchum Then I will say thank you for sharing with us today.  West Well, thank you.  -------  -------
