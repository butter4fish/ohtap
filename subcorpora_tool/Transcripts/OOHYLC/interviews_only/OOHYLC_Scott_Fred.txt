 Finchum  Scott  Today is December the 19, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Noble, Oklahoma to speak with Fred Scott. This is regarding our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life Project so thank you for having us today. Let   s  start with learning when and where you were born.  Okay, I was born northeast of Norman, out in the country. My daddy   s  name was Elmer Scott, my mother was Molly Schat. When I was born,  my dad skipped out. I never have seen him in my life. I don   t know  nothing about a daddy at all, not nothing about him, okay? My mother,  back then there wasn   t nothing to do. She went to live with her  grandmother, which is my great-grandmother, okay? There   s my great-grandmother,  my grandmother, my mother and me living in this house.  I   m a baby.  We all took the typhoid fever in 1916. The day that my grandmother was  buried, my mother died, and they told them,    If you can feed that baby,  he might live.    In other words,    He   s going to die,    and my mother said,     Well, if he dies, I want to die, too    so she   d give me a drink of water  and drink after me. Now this is what I   ve been told by my great-grandmother,  who raised me when I was little, and she was old then, I  mean eighty-five, or maybe ninety. I don   t know how old she was.  I forgot the year my momma died in. I was four years old, and I was  born in    11. So, she died  June 30, 1915 , my mother did. Well, so did  my grandmother, okay? I   m living with my great-grandmother who was  old. I couldn   t even swallow. I couldn   t even eat. I didn   t want to eat.  She   d give me chicken soup every hour with a spoon. I   d open my  mouth,  she would  put it in there, rub my throat. I finally come to, come  out of it a little bit. After we done that for a while, she said when she  come to me I had my mouth open. (Laughter)  5  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  What was your birthday?  My birthday is June the 30th, 1911. Okay. My momma died in    16 so I  should remember. I   ve never seen her face. You have typhoid fever   I  couldn   t start school until I was seven years old. I had to walk a mile and  a quarter, and     Where did you go to school?  Pleasant Hill, Robin Hill now. From my primary through the eighth  grade right there, and then I went to high school for a year and a half,  and then I didn   t have no money, so I had to quit. My guardian never  gave me a dime in his life. He never bought me an ice cream cone. He  never gave me a coke in his life.  Can you explain that?  Huh?  What do you mean by guardian?  He     Who was that?  He was my, I guess you   d call it, guardian. I don   t know.  But was it an aunt, an uncle, a neighbor?  What?  Was it an uncle, or a neighbor?  My great-grandmother was old. She owned a farm, and her son moved  in with her.  Okay.  He   s the one that became my guardian, and then my little butt went to  work. That   s all he knew, was to work. Work, work, work. Don   t tell me  you can   t do it. You see something that needs to be done, get your butt  out there and do it. That   s the way I was raised, me and his wife. When I  was ten, twelve years old   when I was twelve years old I rode my pony  into town and bought a .410 gauge single barrel shotgun, carried it home  on my pony. I was twelve years old and I could harness a team and go to  6  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Finchum  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  the field. They put a box in there so I could stand on it to put the harness  on the horses.  Those were pretty big horses back then.  Well they had big horses and they had big mules. My lands, they had to  pull a plow all day. Look here. See them horses over there? That   s my  team. I had another team bigger than that. See that horse? Oh, you can   t  see it. What   s this horse doing?  looks at pictures   She   s giving you a kiss.  That   s right, she   s giving me sugar. Do you think a horse would give  you sugar?  Only if I had sugar.  I could be standing out in a lot, she   d walk up behind me. I wouldn   t  even know she was there. She   d hit me in the head with her nose.  What was her name?  Huh?  Did she have a name?  Gracie. Of course I knew what she wanted. She wanted me to go feed  her. Okay? She   d head to the barn, and if I didn   t follow her, she   d walk  down there a ways, turn around and look back and see  if I was coming .  She   d come back, come back to me. I said,    All right Gracie, give me  some sugar. I   ll go feed you.    Whenever she come up to me and give me  sugar, I knowed what she wanted. I love horses. You hit one of them  horses with a strap, you   re fired. I could hook them on to anything and  tell you in five seconds if they could pull it or not, and if they couldn   t  pull it, I did not hit them. I didn   t have to. They was putting out all they  had. Why? Because I fed them, I took care of them. They took care of  me.  So did you farm?  Huh?  Did you farm?  Sure, and I wished I could still farm but I had to quit. Tinker Field  opened up in 1945. Everybody went to Tinker Field to work, okay. I had  7  Finchum  Scott  Finchum  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  160 acres, I had eighty acres, and I had six acres of my own. Of course  now this 160 and that eighty were rented property, okay, but I farmed it  with horses. I had a good horse outfit, and I could do it but people went  to buying tractors, and I had to hire somebody to slice my oats and  thresh my wheat. I had to get somebody to bale the hay, somebody with  a baler. I could do the rest of it. I weighed 135 pounds, and I could  handle seventy-pound bales of hay all day.  Well, did you go to Tinker to work, too?  Huh?  Did you go to Tinker to work, too?  No  I was busy on the farm. I was doing what I loved to do but when  Tinker Field opened up, everybody went up there. I couldn   t get nobody  to thresh my grain, nobody to bale my hay, so what am I going to do?  Go in debt  50,000 for a tractor? All these here stuff to farm with? No  sir, not me, so I sold out, had a sale, farm sale. I come to the house with  a wagon full of corn, and there was a man I went to school with and his  boss from OU, and they said,    Fred, we want you to come work for us.     I   d never said a word to him about nothing but they knew. I guess  somebody   d heard something I was going to quit, so they come.    We  want you to come go to work for us,    so I sold out, moved to town, went  to work for OU. Of course, the first thing we did, we bought a two-bedroom  house on Jones Street, 1012 North Jones. Guess what we give  for it? We give four thousand dollars for it, two bedrooms.  When you say    we    you mean you and your wife?  Yeah, me and my wife. We give  4,200 I think or something like that,  okay. I improved it all the time that I was working for twenty years. We  sold it  and moved to Madill, Oklahoma .  When we moved back to  Norman we bought a house at 1506 Morland.  My daughters sold it the  other day for  97,800. I gave   21,000  for it but I worked. I improved  it. My yard didn   t have no weeds, period. No other grass, just Bermuda  grass. My lot was 100-foot wide and 387 feet long, and that   s where I  raised all of them tomatoes and all that stuff. My wife, you know, in her  last years she had a bad time.  How did you meet your wife?  How did I meet her?  Yeah.  8  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Okay, first time I seen my wife she was eight years old, sitting in her  daddy   s lap, combing his hair, and her daddy fought in the Civil War.  Now, not World War I, the Civil War. He was seventy-seven years old  when my wife was born. The reason why I went over to her house, my  guardian   s wife and me, and of course we drove a wagon, to buy some  apples. They had the prettiest apple orchard you ever saw in your life,  and that whole eighty acres was just orchards and berry vines and an old  poor sand hill farm, okay. Guess what she got for them apples? Twenty-five  cents a bushel. I mean good, pretty, fresh, perfect apples. Twenty-five  cents a bushel. There was four wagons out there loading up with  apples. Well, what in the world was they going to do? They drove to  Norman and peddled them for fifty cents a bushel. That   s how people  made a living back there. They didn   t have no pension.  You met your wife when she was eight. When did you get married?  Okay, okay. When she was eight   when she was thirteen, I bought her  her first Christmas present.  What was that?  Huh?  What   d you buy her?  I bought it here in town somewhere. It was a compact. It was square-shaped  like that. You opened it up and it had a mirror and had a lipstick  across the bottom, and some rouge. Oh, it was   it   s nice for them. She  was tickled, okay. She was thirteen. She was sixteen the ninth day of  August in 1929. We married the next day, which was the tenth of  August, 1929. Our first child was born in 1932. Now he would have  been what, eighty-one or something like that, okay. The second one was  a girl, Mary Sue, and she was two years  later  so she was born in   1934 , and then Carrie is the baby. She was born in 1940, Memorial  Day. Now see, I   m 102 and a half, but I   m crazy. I   ve lost all the salt  system out of my body but they said it would come back, slowly, but  I   ve said things that   my goodness.  So you got married when your wife was sixteen?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was eighteen.  9  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Finchum  Scott  Bishop  Scott  And did you go on a honeymoon?  No  I borrowed  25 to get married on. For the chivaree, I bought a box  of cigars and some chewing gum   packages of chewing gum, Juicy  Fruit chewing gum. You buy it for a nickel. Cigars was a nickel a piece  or something like that, you know, and I give the men a cigar, and I give  the girls a package of gum. That was the chivaree, okay. We got married  on, well, it was Thursday, and there was a man coming down the road in  front of the house. My wife was at her brother   s house, and of course I  was down there, and he had a flat tire. So I went out there and I said,     Well doc, you   ve got a flat tire.       Yeah.    Back then, you had a car tool,  you took the tire off, you patched the inner tube, you pumped it up by  hand. He said,    I heard you kids wanted to get married?    I said,    Yeah,  but I   ve got to have a job first.    You couldn   t get a job in 1929. The  bottom fell out of everything. That   s when the Great Depression started,  was in 1929. You couldn   t buy a job. You work all day long, ten hours,  for a dollar. I broke corn all day, ten hours, for ten cents an hour, yeah.  Oh, I   ve had a life. I   ve had a wonderful life, okay. Do you believe what  I   m telling you?  Yeah.  So what kind of work did you do for OU?  Okay. I started out delivering groceries. They had what they called a  commissary, and they had   the  Women   s  Quadrangle had a thousand  girls, Cross Center had a thousand boys, Residential Hall had 365, and  there was sixty-five or seventy in the athletic department. Then after I   ve  done that for a while, the butcher was an old man. He   d been a butcher  ever since he was sixteen years old. He was always behind. Well, when  I   d get caught up with the groceries, I   d go in there and help him. Well,  it come to he had to have help. What they   d do, if you needed help,  they   d send you over a dishwasher, didn   t know nothing about it, okay.  So he said,    Well, what about letting Fred help me?    Well I   d been  helping him all the time, you know, coming in there and helping him.  Well, he didn   t know it, but when we was on the farm I killed my own  hogs, I cleaned them, I skinned them, I dressed them, I cured the meat.  That   s the way you lived back there, and that   s the reason why I   m 102.  We raised what we eat, okay. Now then, I forgot where I was.  You were talking about being hired at OU.  Okay. Then I went to work in the butcher shop, okay. I worked there  twenty years. We got twenty head of cattle every Monday morning,  handing on the rail to go in that shop. Ground two thousand pounds of  hamburger meat every week. The football boys, I cut every steak they  10  ate, and all the ground meat, ground it myself. We had a grinder, meat  grinder, had a seven-horsepower electric motor on it. They had a bit out  there that big. (Gestures) You could ground fifty pounds in five minutes.  I ground two thousand pounds without stopping, okay.  I had to take a vacation. I went on my vacation, two weeks, up to  Huntington, West Virginia, to see my daughter. When I come back, the  big boss, the head of the commissary department, he was the head of the  housing department, I mean. Of course he was over the butcher shop,  too, you know, the head of it, you know. Of course I was the boss inside  of the work, but that   s all, just the work. Well, he met me at the door.     Fred, we lost two thousand pounds of meat while you was gone. I want  to know why.    First of all, I was stunned, you know. It was just eight  o   clock in the morning, and there was all that beef hanging there on the  rail. He said,    No, you do it, you go.    So I went down to ladies   Women   s  Quadrangle. We had to date the boxes, and there was a date  on the box from the first week I was gone, and that   s where the rotten  meat was, okay?  I take the box back to the butcher shop. Well, when I get there, boy, he  meets me. He wants to know why. I go in the meat room, deep freezer. It  was sixty-foot square, where we put the meat. I mean, we didn   t fool  around. We had twenty head of cattle every Monday morning. We had  to have room to put it, and we had shelves that sat on zero night and day,  okay? When you get two-thousand pounds of hamburger meat you go  inside there and you take the boxes, and you put them in them shelves.  Well, we had a jack that had a long handle on it, hydraulic, and you  could set a thousand pounds of meat on it, push the handle down. One  man could drag it in there, okay. Now it   d been two weeks, now, so that  meat was sitting there on that plat just piled up together, you know, them  boxes. Well the outside of the box would be all right but the inside  would be rotten because the freezer couldn   t freeze it, you know. It was  too thick, too much. You   re supposed to take it out of there and put it in  them shelves, and them men that worked for me knew to do it.  So we took it all out there and I said,    Well, Garner,    that   s his first  name, I said,    You know I   ve always took up for my men.    I said,    I   m  not going to take up for them this time.    They knew better. They knew  what to do, and they know why the meat spoiled. Then I took him in  there and showed him. Boy, listen, went outside. He told them boys,     From now on, Fred grinds the hamburger meat.    That   s all. We had to  stand them on a box, that thing was way up there. Boy, if you got your  hand in there, I mean it   s gone.  We had to mix the fat with the lean. If you get it too fat   man, they   d  been getting it. The butcher shop, I mean the football boys, where they  11  Finchum  Scott  Finchum  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  ate, they was all complaining about the meat being fat, and there was a  lady in there who said,    Well, Fred didn   t grind that meat. I   ll tell you  that right now.    So Mr. Collins said,    Fred is going to sit up there and  put the meat in there. You hand it up to him,    and we put it in a box, and  the fifty pounds in the box.    You carry it away.     Lady, I know meat. You   re not going to fool me on meat. I went in a  butcher shop and I said,    I want a choice rump roast.    Well, he seen me  looking at the counter. He knew good and well I knew that wasn   t  choice so he goes in the back, cuts one off fresh and brought it out there.  I said,    Now, I know you know I know that   s not what I told you I  wanted.    I can tell just by looking. I know what this meat is they serve  here. There   s six kinds: prime, choice, good, utility. I mean commercial,  utility, canner, and cutter. Now, canner and cutter is low grade, cattle  that   s been sick or they are so poor their backbone   s sticking up like  that. And the next grade up, if you see it, you wouldn   t eat the meat,  okay? Guess what they serve here?  What?  Well, now, I told you, USDA good. That means it   s inspected by the  government. Okay, now USDA good is what the commissary bought.  That   s what the football boys eat and what everybody eat. It   s good. I  mean it   s inspected by the government. It   s good, but prime and choice  is fat, and that man told me, he said,    There is not a choice piece of roast  in this town.    The housewives won   t buy it, it   s too fat. You can see  white streaks are running through the lean. Man, I mean it   s tender. You  take a t-bone steak off a choice steer. I don   t care if he weighs 2,000  pounds, that meat has got fat running through it. If it doesn   t have, that   s  where you get the taste on meat.  In the fat.  I know this meat here, it can   t be   it   s a fourth or fifth grade. I   d say it   s  a fifth grade. It   s utility.  You said you raised tomatoes?  Huh?  You raised tomatoes?  That   s later on, after I quit the university.  How old were you when you quit?  12  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  When I quit the university?  Yeah.  It was in 19   let   s see, I retired in    76, and it was ten or twelve years  before that, so it would have to be what,    68 or something like that, or     67. Somewhere along there, when I left the commissary, okay? Then  we, me and my wife saved our money, all we could, and we bought a lot  down at Lake Texoma, down in Cumberland Cove, okay. We bought  this lot, and then we built a house on it. While we was building this  house, the university didn   t want me to quit. They wanted me to stay  there. My wife   s sister lived down there so my wife stayed down there  with her sister half the time and watched them build the house.  Well, when they got the house built, then, of course, I moved down there  again. I quit the university and moved down there. I think it was 1964,  something like that, okay. It took me a year to fix the yard and fix  everything up like we wanted it. I mean when we left, we left a beautiful  place. Then, I got a job in Madill in a butcher shop, sixty dollars a week,  and I said,    No. Give me sixty-five and I   ll come,    okay. They gave me  sixty-five dollars a week. Well, I had to work from ten o   clock on  Saturday. Well, I hadn   t been used to that. So, I walk across the creek to  the county assessor   s office, and I get acquainted with the county  assessor, and I get acquainted with the sheriff, and the county treasurer,  and     And this is what county?  Marshall County.  Marshall County.  Yeah, and I get acquainted with the people, and the bank. I got  acquainted with the banker because I put my money in the bank, okay.  So I got acquainted with a lot of people. Now, I walk across the street  and put in my application in the county assessor   s office. Well, I heard  she was going to retire so I went over and put my application in, and she  called me over there one day, and by the way, she give me the job. Well  here I am, I don   t remember how old I was, anyway, she give me the  job. Well, they was young people put their applications in, and I worked  there three months and I said, I called her by name, let   s see, I know her  name, it   s right on the tip of my tongue. Anyway, I said,    How come  you hired me when I told you I didn   t know one thing about it?    She  said,    If I had hired that college graduate, he would have been here three  months, as much as you have. He   d be telling me what to do,    and the  other man had been in business nineteen years on the square. She wanted  13  Finchum  Scott  Bishop  somebody to do what she wanted them to do, okay, so she give me the  job over all these other young people, okay.  I worked there five years and she retired so I run for the office. They  was two men run against me, when they found out I was going to run.  There were two men running against me. One of them had been in  business nineteen years, right there on the square, selling car parts. The  other one was a college graduate, lived in the south end of the county.  Here I am, a little   okay, you know we had to make a stump speech,  okay. Guess what I said on the stump speech. I said,    The two men  that   s running against me are both good men but I   m the one that   s  qualified for the job.    That   s all I ever said. I never said one bad word  about them, not one. I never said this one done that and this one done  that. Not one word did I say, okay. When election day come, I had a son  lived in Norman, and he come down to Madill when they was going to  count the votes, to hold my head he said. (Laughter) Well, I   d just been  in the county seven years. These guys, my land  Okay. When the votes  was counted, I had 169 votes more than both of them put together. You  do not have to run somebody down to make you look good.  I agree.  Tell it like it is. These men are good men. I   m the one that   s qualified,  that   s all I ever said. You wouldn   t believe what was told on me. I got  169 votes more than both of them put together. That meant it wasn   t no  run-off, there wasn   t. I   m elected. I   m it, right there. When they counted  the votes, I   m it, okay. Now, I didn   t have no trouble because I   d been  there five years, and I hired one of the other girls. No, she hadn   t been  working there but I hired a young woman that I knew, and when I quit,  why, I gave the job to her. She didn   t have to run. I wrote the county  commissioners a letter.  You didn   t know county commissioners controlled the county but they  can have a lot to do with it, and they gave her the job. Just give it to her  because of my recommendation that they do that. Well, she knowed  what to do, okay. They gave her the job. She retired from that county  assessor   s office. She stayed there twenty years, okay. You think she  didn   t praise me? I just gave her the job over them other people. Now  the reason why I got that many votes: the bank was for me, the  courthouse was for me, the post office was for me, the grocery store was  for me, the Baptist people of Marshall County was for me. That   s kind  of hard to beat when you get   now, if I   d have been a destructive person  that run people down, do you think I   d have been that popular?  Nope, nope.  14  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Do you know why I was that popular? I taught Sunday school for  seventy years in the church, moved to four different churches, okay.  Every time election day come to elect new teachers, which is once a year  in the Baptist Church, whenever election time come, I   m the teacher  because when I joined a church, I went to Sunday school in that class,  okay. When it come time to get a teacher, I   m the teacher. I didn   t ask  for the job. Now, that bible, you   re going to have a hard time finding  something in there that I don   t know something about it. I   ve read it  through, I   ve read it, I   ve read it, I   ve read it. You   re not going to teach  Sunday school, the adult men. I started when I was twenty-seven years  old teaching adult men. There was men in my class forty years old, fifty  years old. There was deacons in my class. Here I am twenty-seven years  old, but the next year I   m the teacher, the next year I   m the teacher. I  didn   t ask for it. Every church I joined, and I was just at three other  churches, when Sunday school time come, I   m the teacher. Now, why?  Because I   m an aggravator, I   m mean, I   m mad, you know.  That   s being sarcastic now.  I   m sarcastic, yeah, yeah. (Laughter)  Well, has religion always been a central part of your life?  Huh?  Has religion always been a central part of your life?  Oh, it   s always been. Church has always been, yeah, yeah.  What is it about church that   s been important to you?  The main thing about church is Jesus died for your sins and my sins, and  even though, what   s hard for me still yet, you take a bum, you take a  dope addict, he died for him same as he did me and you, but you have to  accept him as your Lord and Savior. You   ve got a choice. You can  accept him or reject him. Do what you want to but if you don   t accept  him, you know where you   re going to go, and if you do accept him, you  know where you   re going to go, but when you accept him, you live for  him. You do the best you can. Somebody asked me one time and I said,     Well, it   s because I don   t smoke, I don   t chew, I don   t run around with  them that do.    (Laughter)  Well, what   s your motto to life?  Huh?  15  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  What   s your motto for living, and your philosophy?  My motto?  Yes.  Well, my main thing is to live a good Christian life. Live a good life.  Don   t run around. Listen, you are looking at a one-woman man. I never  trifled on my wife not even one time, and when we was going together,  she   d slap your face. I   m a one-woman man. Now, you know what I   m  talking about.  Yes.  When my wife passed away   it was a little over two years, she injured  her spine, spinal cord. She was completely paralyzed. She didn   t even  know when she went to the bathroom, okay. She   s laying there in that  bed over two years now and she got a sore on her tailbone. Well, we  called in a nurse, and she said,    Well, you need to call a doctor.    So we  called a doctor, and he told me what to do, and we got her healed up  pretty quick, okay. Now he said,    I   ll tell you what, if you don   t want  her to have a sore, you turn her over every two hours.    Now here I am,  I   m eighty-five. I turned my wife every two hours, day and night, by  myself, nobody helped me, by myself, okay. People didn   t believe it  hardly, you know. Well, I bought a van, an old dodge van, give two  thousand dollars for it. It had a side-door to it, and a push button. This  thing come out, push the wheelchair on it, push her in the van, and I took  her to the grocery store. Her mind was sharp. She didn   t lose her mind, it  was good. All she could do was this (gestures head turning) and talk but  she   d tell me what she wanted, and I   d still buy and do what she wanted  me to do.  She was the boss.  You ever pick up somebody paralyzed?  It   s very hard.  You ought to try that some time. It   s work, like picking up a log, okay. I  pick her up out of bed and set her in that wheelchair and then wheel her  out there to the van and put her in the van and lock it in there. Then I   d  go around and get in the driver   s seat and go to the grocery store. Now  that takes time, and that takes work, okay. I didn   t ask nobody to help  me, I done it myself. She   s my wife.  I   ve had people tell me,    Well, I took care of my mother.    You did?  16  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop     Yeah, I was there every day from two to four.    Well what about the  other ten hours, or the other   but that took her two hours a day. I know  what taking care of the sick is. Now, I mean take care of them. I don   t  mean just walk in,    How are you doing today?    and walk out. That   s not  taking care of them. I know what it is to take care of people.  I feel so sorry for these people here. I want to help them so bad. One  lady, she   d get in a wheelchair, she run into the table. Oh, now she   s  stuck. I can   t walk so I take my wheelchair over there and I said,    Lady,  if you hold this steel wheel still and move this wheel, it   ll push you away  from the table.    The next day, she   s right back against the table again.  You can   t help them. They don   t even know why they   re here.  What   s a day like for you?  Day like?  Yeah.  It   s misery.  What time do you get up and go to bed, and what do you do during the  day?  Well, now I go to bed about ten o   clock or nine thirty, or ten o   clock.  Now then, I could go to bed by myself but I don   t, I have a girl. I push a  button and a girl comes in here. She   ll turn the bed down for me and go  around there, and she   ll pull my pants off and pull the cover back, and  I   ll get in the bed and she   ll cover me up. Of course, I   ve got to have a  urinal, and she   ll hand me that thing, you know. I took care of that  myself, okay. When it gets full   I don   t know when it   s full because I  can   t see it, you know. I can   t get up and move but I   ll pull it up there,  then I   ll push the button. They   ll come and get it and empty it. I have  had them to come and empty it, and walk right out that door.    What else  do you want? Do you need something else?    No, they   re back out the  door. They   re taking care of me.  Now one thing about this place here, it is clean. If these britches gets a  spot on it, this shirt gets a spot on it, they   ll change it. Right there   You   ve got to be clean. If somebody comes in here, the people are clean,  the place is clean. It   s a nice place. I   ve got two daughters.    Daddy, just  think, you   ll have a nice, clean, warm place to stay. You   ll have three  meals a day.     What type of activities do you do here during the day?  17  Scott  Bishop  Scott  I can   t even have a conversation. The people that work here are busy.  They can   t talk to you. There   s nothing wrong with the ladies that come  in here and wait on you. I   m not talking about them. They   ve got a boss  over this place, okay. Now she tells her workers what to do. They do it,  what she says to do. She   s got a boss over her. There   s no telling     there   s three or four people, three or four men own this. You know what  they say? They   re probably living in a nice place in Oklahoma City or  Kansas City or somewhere,    Send me the money.    That   s all in God   s  world they want is the money, the people that own the place.  I want to back up because you were talking, you said to hold off for a  minute, but tell me about your garden, your tomatoes, and what you do  to them?  Well, now when my wife died, she died in 1996. It was a Tuesday  morning, at four o   clock in the morning. I   m crazy, okay. We had the  funeral and I   m left by myself. Well, I go out and plow my garden. Now,  I take a sprayer. I   ve got two two-gallon sprayers. I use one for my  garden and one for my fence rows and the rough stuff. There is not a  weed or a grass in my fence row. I cut all the brush off. If it comes back  new, I spray it. My fence rows is clean. You can go look today, okay.  The flower beds, I sprayed them, you know. I keep the grass out of it.  How   d you do that? Well, I just told you. I sprayed the fence row. No  Bermuda crawls over the fence. It don   t crawl under the fence because I  spray it. I go on the other side that belongs to the other fellow, and he  don   t care because he   d like to have a clean fence row, too. So I spray it.  Can you believe that? I lived in town, no grass and no weeds in my  fence row. I don   t go down there and expect to find it that way now,  because it   s been three years. My daughters, they had it fertilized and all  cleaned up and where I raised a garden cleaned up. Where I raised  tomatoes, no.  Anyway, my wife loved flowers. I built a side room onto one little house  that we had there on the place. The man that bought my house got three  other buildings beside the house. One was a garage and the other one  was   my wife was a seamstress, and I mean, she made me a winter coat  without even a pattern. I mean she could sew anything. I bought her a  Touch and Sew sewing machine. Cleaned that place up. I spent I think   5,000 on the inside of her shop where she worked. Built her a place  back there to hang her clothes for her customers, okay. She started to put  a zipper in a pair of jeans, broke a gear in that brand new sewing  machine. Paid  365 or something for it, I don   t know. I don   t remember  just how much. Anyway it cost sixty dollars to get a bearing put back in  there. I said,    Well Momma, I can fix that.    She had an old Singer in the  house that she used to use, you know. So I go buy a little table, pointed  table, put it in the corner, cut a hole in it, stick that old Singer in there.  18  Finchum  Scott  Bishop  Scott  She   s got a chair that   s got roll wheels on it. She can go from one  sewing machine to the other. That didn   t happen anymore. That took  care of that problem.  Well, see, now it   s like raising a garden. They said,    What are you going  to do that for?    My tomato rows was five-foot apart.    Well, you   re just  wasting land     Well, now I   d go six times to every row planting it.    You  mean you went six times to a row to plant it?    Okay, I wouldn   t till the  ground. I got a push plow by hand, okay. I make a straight row. Now my  rows wasn   t like this (gestures wavy). My rows was straight. You know  how I make a straight row? You get up here at this end, and you pick  you out a fence row or a fence post or something, and you go straight to  it. Now, you don   t look up, you go straight to that place. Now, you don   t  put it deep, you don   t strain it, you don   t look off, okay. Then I used my  rototiller, you know, and then I get out there five foot, and I make a  stake here and a stake there, okay. I have seven rows of tomatoes, 200, I  put 210 plants of tomatoes.  Mercy.  I   d say,    How many tomato plants did you put?       Oh, I bought five or  six plants. Seven or eight plants.    You know these bunches of onions  you see that   s got a green top on it? I said,    How many onion plants did  you buy?       Three or four,    you know, like that, you know. I put out  forty. Legend   s Restaurant bought 160 onions every week. She bought  350 pounds of tomatoes in five days, and I   d still have 500 pounds of  tomatoes in that house. I had it air conditioned with a window air  conditioner, and I had a little floor burner stove in there to heat it in the  winter time. My wife could get out there and sew day or night, winter  time and all. I   ve went out there at eleven o   clock at night and made her  quit sewing. She loved to sew that much, and she retired from John A.  Brown, and she was the head of the Ladies    Wear.  What   s John A. Brown?  John A. Brown there in Norman, at the university. It   s on Lindsey Street.  It   s right west of Jenkins there, you know. It   s on, not Lindsey Street, it  was on Boyd, Boyd Street. She was working for Lowe   s Department  Store. Well then she got a job working for Brown   s. Well Brown   s, they  left Norman for a year or two, then they come back to Norman. When  they come back to Norman they hunted my wife up, where she worked,  she worked for Lowe   s. They went up there, and the first thing they told  her,    We   ll give your five dollars a week more than what you   re  making.    They didn   t ask her how much she made.    We   ll give you five  dollars a week more.    Now, she must have been pretty good. (Laughter)  19  Finchum  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Must have been.  You go in there and buy a skirt from her,    I   ve got a blouse over here  that you would just look wonderful in it. Just exactly matches, you   d  look pretty. You   d look good.    She knew how to sell that stuff, and she  would, if it didn   t fit perfect, she   d take it home and fix it. She didn   t  have to go get somebody else, she   d take it home herself and fix it. Well,  needless to say, Brown   s made money off of her. That   s the reason why  they gave her five dollars a week more than what she was making.  My wife was a worker, and I was a worker. You know how we saved  money? Before she died, I was raising tomatoes before she died, and we  canned stuff all the time in my garage right there by the house. I had  nine shelves, twelve foot long, made out of one-by-twelves, twelve foot  long, one right on top of the other and high enough to put a fruit jar in.  We canned three hundred quarts every year, out of my garden. Now,  how do you live to be 102?  What is your secret?  Huh?  What is your secret?  My secret?  Yeah.  Well, the main thing is, you can   t be lazy and have a garden like that.  Now, all I done was to mow my yard, do my spraying, and take care of  my garden. That   s all I done. Now, if my tomatoes needed picking or if  they needed hoeing or anything, I didn   t say    Well, I   ll do it tomorrow.     You   ve got something that needs to be done, get your tail out there and  do it. Now, I could have said    Well, I   ve got to do this and I can   t        Okay, there come a two-inch rain that night, you can   t get in your  tomato plants for a week. See what I   m saying? If you use your head,  your body will take care of yourself.  Well, why do you think you   ve lived so long?  Huh?  What do you think has contributed to your long life?  That   s what done it. It   s work. I visited my daughter, and me and my  grandson were sitting out on the front porch, and his daddy come  20  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Finchum  Scott  around,    Kurt, why don   t you go mow the yard?       Oh, Dad,    great big  old thirteen, fourteen-year-old boy, you know,    Oh, Dad.    About that  time, here come a man up the sidewalk in a wheelchair, and he can just  barely make it go. I tapped my grandson on the shoulder, and I said     Son, you see that man? That man would give anything in the world if  he could mow that yard.    You know, my grandson ain   t forgot that yet. I  never said,    You sorry so and so.       You see that man?    I said,    That  man would give anything in the world if he could mow that yard.     Okay? That   s all I needed to say.  When history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  Me?  Yeah.  Well I   ll tell you one thing, you can   t say I   m lazy. (Laughter)  No.  You know how we saved? My wife got sick, I said,    Momma, the only  way we   re ever going to save anything, now, let   s take our social  security check, put it in the bank, and forget what   s in there.    I sold   4,000 one year out of my backyard garden, tomatoes and stuff,   4,000.Whenever you raise a garden like I did, you   d be surprised how  many friends you got. I give away  1,000 every year.  One day I went out to the garden and I picked three or four different  kinds of stuff, took it to the house, washed it, cleaned it. I delivered to  five different families free of charge, didn   t cost them nothing. Why you  crazy thing  Three of them was old widow women and they loved fresh  vegetables. Them women was so proud to get that fresh, clean garden  stuff, just picked. I mean fresh, just picked it, washed it, cleaned it, took  it to them. You know what? I   m not doing that to brag on myself, and I  didn   t do it for no money, but I   m going to tell you something, that   s a  peace of mind. I got more out of it than they did. That   s peace of mind.  I don   t have to worry about how I treated other people. Why do you  think they kept me on the Sunday school? Now, I   m not going to tell you  something I can   t prove.  All right.  Now, this is the way I sell my tomatoes. Now, that   s a six-ten box. Six  gallons of tomatoes, or six gallons of peaches or anything that   s in a  gallon, that would hold six of them cans, and there   s twenty pounds of  tomatoes that are in that box. Now every tomato in there has got the top  21  Finchum  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  turned down. Why?  I don   t know. Why?  You put tomatoes in a plastic box   a lot of people put them in a plastic  sack. That   s wrong. I tell my customer,    If you find a bad tomato, I   ll  give you two.    You think I took care of them? Now here   s some on the  table that   s not ripe yet.    You mean you pick them not ripe?       Well,  don   t you know you raise them on the vine, let them ripen on the vine,  they taste good?       Why them tomatoes won   t be no count.    Okay, I   ve  got a big old plastic bowl thing: fill it full of fresh water, take a  newspaper and double it, pull it through that water and put it over them  tomatoes. Then put some dry newspaper on top of that. In twenty-four  hours, not over thirty hours, they   ll be red ripe just like them in that box,  all right. They   ll be just as good as them you pull off of the vine. Why?  You ever go into a place where they raise tomato plants? They   ve got a  pipe up here, water spraying out of it. They   re not watering their  tomatoes. What are they doing? Well, that   s crazy, just wasting water.  Tomatoes love humidity. Now why did I water them like that and cover  them like that? Creates humidity, to ripen them tomatoes. Now how did  I know to do that? I went in a grocery store one time and there   s a man  back there in the back and he was putting the wet paper over some  tomatoes.    Why? What are you doing that for?    I didn   t forget it. Now  there   s a truckload of watermelons (gestures to photograph), and I sold   5,000 worth of watermelons that year. Now, that watermelon is a   it   s  got two words to it   big, green watermelon like that.  Black diamond?  Huh? Black diamond. That   s what them is, every one of them, and  there   s six on there that will weigh sixty pounds apiece, okay. I just  picked them. Don   t try to push something off on somebody. Golden  Corral bought that pick-up load every week. Every week they   d buy a  pick-up load. Why? I sold it to them for two or three dollars apiece.  Well, they made money off of it. Now here   s another table full of  tomatoes. (Showing photographs)  What kind of tomatoes did you raise?  Better Boys, and Celebrity.  Better Boys and Celebrity.  A Celebrity tomato, they   re not big. They don   t get very big. Legend   s  didn   t want great big ones. They want small ones to put on the sandwich,  22  Finchum  Bishop  Scott  Finchum  Scott  Finchum  Scott  Finchum  Scott  you know. They don   t care about it weighing three pounds. I could make  one weigh three pounds if I wanted to. You plant a Big Boy, okay. She  wanted   she loved the Better Boys, and she loved that. What did I say?  Celebrity.  Celebrity.  Celebrity. A Celebrity tomato will never crack at the top. You   ll never  get a Celebrity tomato   unless it   s just out in the hot sun and nobody  taking care of it, it might be. I never had one split on top. In other words,  when you slice the tomato you didn   t lose nothing. Just where the stem  went in, that   s all you lost on mine, okay. You think people don   t  appreciate that? Okay, now here   s what they look like when they get  ripe. (Shows photograph)  I wish we could eat one.  Now, would you buy a tomato like that?  I would.  You think you would, huh?  I know I would.  Okay, now see them green ones on there? Twenty-four hours they   ll be  ripe. Look just like that. Now here is a pepper, pepper plant. He might  want to see them other tomatoes, I don   t know. Now here   s another box  of tomatoes. That   s in that same house at the same time. That   s not the  same table. Well you go through there and look. That   s not the same  table. At one time all them was out there in my house, and Legend   s I  took them 250 pounds and I still got 500 pounds out there. What am I  going to do? I go over to Walmart, I get me three of four of them signs,  and I stick one at the corner of Boyd and Classen, and I go down to  Brooks Street and I put another one out. I lived on Morland Street,  which is the next street east. Go down there to the corner, Porter and  Classen and put another one. That   s three or four, okay. The very next  day after I put them signs out, the next day, honey, now I   m not lying to  you, I had a roll of bills like that, and my curiosity was up, so I went to  looking. They was 100 one dollar bills in that roll. Now how come that?  One hundred one dollar bills in that bunch.   Nurse interruption   Now this is the way I pick my tomatoes. Now, see how red ripe they  23  Finchum  Scott  Finchum  Scott  Finchum  Scott  are? Twenty-four hours, they looked just like that. Now, when I pick  them, I   ve got that pan of water there. They   re not dirty because I never  pick a tomato off the ground. They never see the dirt. I made big wires. I  give seventy dollars for a roll of wire, five foot high, that they pour  concrete on, and I got a pair of bolt cutters, and I made my own things to  go around them. Now, that wasn   t given to me. They didn   t give me that  roll of wire. You   ve got to spend a little money, that   s what that guy told  me. He says, my son-in-law come to visit,    Fred, what are you going to  do with that?    Well, you   ve got to spend money to make money.  Well, now this the way I pick them. Now they   ll be red ripe in twenty  four hours just like that because I put them on a clean table in a clean  house, every one of them with the stem down, not a one, every one of  them was a stem down, not piled on top of one another. Take that paper,  pull it through that water and put it over them. I   ll guarantee you within  twenty-four hours, they   ll look like that. That   s taking care of stuff. You  mean to tell me? Okay. Now, I   ve raised squash, cucumbers, other stuff,  basil. Basil, you know how high   did you ever buy any basil?  Yes.  You go to Oklahoma City or anywhere, and you go to a place where  they sell stuff, you   ll give thirty dollars for a pound. Now I went to  Walmart, I looked up on the counter. They had a bottle up there, a little  plastic bottle, looked like a salt shaker, okay. It had three or four sprigs.  It said,    One half of one ounce,     3.64. Now you go price it and see.  I believe you.  This lady that owns Legend   s Restaurant, I   ve been selling stuff there  for a long time. She knows where I live, she knows what I do, and she  knows how I take care of things, okay. She don   t call me and tell me  what she wants. I don   t ask her what she wants. I take what I got, and  she buys it. All except my green beans and okra, she wouldn   t buy them  two things. Everything else, she   d buy. I tried to get her, I said,    Look, if  you   ll just fry some okra,    I said,    I know people like fried okra.    I said,     You give it to them one time and they   ll ask for it.    Her customers,  they eat one of them tomatoes,    Where did you get them tomatoes?     That   s the reason she could buy 350 pounds.  That   s a lot of tomatoes.  The customer that she feeds,    Where did you get them tomatoes?    Okay,  now I had to get a woman to help me, and I got another picture in here.  Anyway, what it is, on this back porch here, the concrete thing, okay,  what she   s doing is washing beets or something. I had to get her to help  24  Finchum  Scott  me pick. I can   t pick 200 pounds of tomatoes and pick okra and pick  green beans and pick squash, cucumbers. I can   t do it so I get her to help  me. You know what? She didn   t charge me anything. You know why? I  told her, I said    Anything you want, you go out there and get it.    She   d  walk out of there with three or four sacks full of stuff. I didn   t care, but  she didn   t charge me nothing. Why? That   s how you make money, but  you   ve got to get your butt out there and take care of the garden.  Now here   s some garden stuff here, okay. Now here   s some cucumbers,  now I don   t know what all   that   s turnips. Here   s another wheelbarrow  full of tomatoes, and here   s another picture of me selling them. See  them? That   s the way to pick them, okay.  Now, I was telling you about planting them, or I started to tell. I quit and  went to talking about something else. Okay, I go down that row with that  garden plow. Now I don   t go deep, I just walk down there. I   m going to  make a straight row, okay? Then I come right back up that same row and  plow deep. Well, I   ll tell you there   s not a clod in my garden. There   s no  clods out there. That rototiller will get it if you give it it   s time. Don   t try  to do it all in an hour. Anyhow, now I rototilled   I went twice to that  one row. Then I get me a stick, thirty inches long, okay. I sit down here  on that row, and I make a mark here and I make a mark here. Then I  bring that stick over here and I make a mark here. Every tomato in that  row is thirty inches apart, and every one of them has got that wire hoop  around it. You think that don   t look pretty?  Now my rows is five foot apart. A man come there,    Well, don   t you  know you   re just wasting land. What are you doing that for?    Well, now  you   ve got two rows of tomatoes. You sit down there between them two  rows with a ten-gallon bucket to pick your tomatoes. After you fill that  bucket, you go to the house to empty it. How long, how many times are  you going to go to the house emptying that bucket? If you make the  rows five foot apart you can push that wheel barrow down it. There   s a  hundred pounds in there.  Mercy.  Just going down two rows, there   s a hundred pounds of tomatoes there,  but there   s thirty-two tomatoes in each row. Every one of them is five  foot apart in the row, thirty inches apart in the row. Okay. Now then,  where I made that mark with that stick I go get me some ten-twenty-ten,  that   s fertilizer. I put a tablespoon full at each one of them little marks.  That   s all, just a tablespoon full. Then I go get a box of Epsom salts.  Epsom salts, and I take that and I put a tablespoon full on each one of  them, okay? Now that   s four times I   ve went down that row. Okay, then  I go down it and I mix that all up. That   s five times. Then I go get my  25  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  tomato plants out of the   , you know. I put one here and one here,  everywhere one of them marks are. I get down on my hands and knees,  and I   now the dirt is so loose, all I   ve got to do is pull it back this way  and slap that tomato plant in there, slap the dirt on it. It   s planted  because I got it ready. Use your head. I got it ready, it   s easy  I don   t  have to work at it. A twelve-year old kid could do it, okay?  I want to know, too, is did you ever think you   d make it to 100?  I never even thought about it. When I was ninety-nine years old     You knew it was going to happen.     I sold  3,000 out of my garden, when I was ninety-nine years old. The  next year, I   m 100. That   s 2-0-1-0, I   m 100 years old. Okay. I fell and  broke my hip. Well, I couldn   t do it. Okay, the next year, 2011, I fell and  broke this hip. I wasn   t satisfied, I had to work. Well, I was old, I had  my hips broke, you know, and I couldn   t hold my balance. I get  overbalanced and I fell. Hey, I fell just six months ago. I was in the  bathroom, and they got a bar to hold to, okay. Well, I had to pull my  pants up, you know. I turned loose of the bar. Okay, I fell. I hit my head  on the lower facing of the toilet, you know. I mean to tell you, I peeled  it, boy.  If you could give advice to fellow Oklahomans about living a long life,  what would you tell them?  Work  Listen, don   t never quit work because you   re sixty-five. That is  no excuse. If you ever quit work, that   s wrong.  Is retiring quitting?  What?  If a person wants to retire do you consider that quitting?  Well, a lot of people do. I   ve got a son-in-law,    I   ve already done my  work. I   m sixty-five, I   ve done my work.    He sat down on his butt. It  wasn   t no time until he had Alzheimer   s disease. Now then he can   t do  nothing, and my daughter can   t do anything but stay there with him. He  couldn   t walk from here to that bathroom to get something, when he got  in there, he   d forget what he went after. There   s one of them again  (photograph of tomatoes). Now here is some more bell peppers, there   s  another one of them. I think this is jalapeno peppers, I don   t know. Now  here is some cucumbers. Would you buy that cucumber there?  26  Finchum  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Finchum  Scott  Finchum  Scott  Finchum  Scott  From you, yes.  You   d buy that cucumber? Okay, my son had a farm east of Noble.  Well, we   re going to stop here I think.  Huh?  I said we   re going to stop recording here if that   s okay, and I   m going to  ask you a few questions.  Well, wait just a minute.  Okay.  That   s my son   s farm. (Gestures to photograph) Now I went down there  and planted some stuff. Now, look here, what   s in that picture?  Green beans, squash, cucumbers. I don   t know what that is back there.  That   s beets.  Beets.  See all these onions, and that   I was going to tell you about that spice,  what     Basil?  Basil. Legend   s, where I sell and she bought so much stuff. She comes  by my house and she has four little packages of this garden stuff, you  know. It   s in packages that you pick up,    Fred, would you plant this for  me?       Yeah, what is it?       Basil.    I   d never seen any basil. I   d never  seen any basil raised. What am I going to do? That   s the littlest seed you  ever saw. You cannot take it   I went down to the store and I bought a  little round thing and you put them in there. It   s got a wheel that you  turn and there   s a little hole here and a little bigger hole here, and a little  bigger hole here. I used next to the smallest hole to plant that basil, put it  in there and shake it a little bit, you know.  I had about a fifty-foot row, and I called her and I said,    Rebecca, I  believe that stuff   s ready to pick.    I didn   t say basil, I said,    I believe  that stuff   s ready to pick.    She knowed what I was talking about. Well,  here she comes. She   s got two men from the store with her. Each one of  them has got a pair scissors. What in the world were they going to do?  Well, it   s got a flower on it, just like a sunflower if you let it go, but she  27  Finchum  Scott  Finchum  Scott  Bishop  Finchum  don   t want it to bloom. She wants it before that, okay. They was picking  the top, pick it up like that and cut the stem off. You just buy that little  top. It takes a bunch of it to weigh a pound, okay. She picked it,    Well,  what do I owe you, Fred?       You don   t owe me nothing. You bought the  seed, you picked it, you don   t owe me nothing.    Well, of course I  planted it and I kept it clean, and I grew it and watered it.  The main thing is, after you plant it, you water it. If you don   t, you   re  going to lose the seed, okay. So, I went out there,    What do I owe you,  Fred?    I said,    I don   t have the slightest idea.    (Laughs) Can you  imagine? I   m talking to my customer. I   m going to sell it. She   s going to  buy it.    What might you want, Fred?       I don   t have the slightest idea.     I   m a mean sucker, okay. She said,    How about thirty dollars?    I said,     Okay.    So I let her have it for thirty dollars. In ten days I picked it  again, took it out there, thirty dollars. Well, I got more, I picked it again,  took it out there, thirty dollars, okay. That   s ninety dollars I made that  month all from a row fifty-foot long. You think I couldn   t afford to do  that? Why rob her? I made ninety dollars off of a fifty-foot row. One  row  But I picked it myself.  Look at that, cucumbers or squash? (Gestures to photograph) Look at  these cucumbers. Now here   s another table full of them tomatoes that  you didn   t see. I usually keep them together, but in showing them I get  them mixed up. There   s me and my two daughters. Now, this is where  my garden is, but see, there   s nothing planted out there, you know.  That   s in the fall, you know, everything   s gone. I think that   s out there  on my son   s farm. Now here   s one here, but that   s a lie. They said that  weighed three pounds. Well it won   t do it, I can tell you that. See, it   s  kind of like meat. You ain   t going to fool me on meat. I   ve cut too much  of it, I   ve seen too much of it, and you   re not going to sell me something  that   I   ll say,    That ain   t what I told you I wanted.    (Laughs) He looked  at me so funny. Now there   s another plant. I can   t see anymore very  good. I don   t know what that is.  Some kind of pepper.  Now look it, you think them rows are straight? You make a row that  straight?  I don   t think I could, no.  Would you go six, seven times to put out a row of tomatoes?  Well, that   s cabbage.  If you told me to.  28  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  Scott  Bishop  If I told you to.  Let   s see that cabbage plant.  That   s cabbage.  Yes, and cauliflower.  Now this is down on my son   s farm.  Cabbage and cauliflower.  I think that   s a pepper plant. That   s a bell pepper. Anyway, well that   s  all of them (photographs) that   s any good. The rest of this stuff   s just  stuff. That   s my son   s farm. I went down there, that   s where I raised my  watermelons. He bought this eighty acres, and he blocked it off in two-acres  tracts and he   s going to sell tracts. Well, there   s a ditch run down  through there, and sandy ground, and there   s two acres there, and he  bought some cattle. He bought, I don   t know, eleven or twelve cows, put  them in there, put them in that lot, and he fed them just round bales of  hay. And boy, I said,    Son that would sure make watermelons.     Well, so he gets a tractor and his disc. He   s going to come up there and  disc it so I can plant watermelons. Well, that disc wouldn   t even cut that  hay. There was too much of it on there so he has to get his backhoe, pull  it around, scatter it out, then disc it, okay. Now I didn   t rototill it. I   m  just raising watermelons. I don   t care about it, you know. It ain   t my  land. I   m just raising watermelons, you know, but I wanted some good  dirt. That   d been laid out for twenty years, you know. Well, they hadn   t  grown on it, you know. I mean, you can grow anything. Anyway, that   s  where I got that truck load of watermelons, is off of that patch.  Now, I didn   t raise a lot of tomatoes that year. (Laughs) But can you  imagine? You come down there and look at that garden. No weeds, no  grass. My yard at the house, absolutely Bermuda grass. Nothing else, not  a weed in it, not any other kind of grass in it, just Bermuda grass. That   s  all that   s there. Okay. People come there,    How do you do that?     Well, we want to thank you for sharing you stories, and sharing a little  bit of your life with us today.  -------  -------
