 Finchum  Today is July 24, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University and today we   re in  Oklahoma City to talk with Luegene Merritt. This is part of our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life project so thank you very much for having us  today.  Well, I appreciate you coming.  Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  I was born June the first, 1914 in we   ll say Bloomer, Arkansas, which is  about fifteen miles south of Fort Smith, Arkansas.  Bloomer?  Bloomer. (Laughs) But this little town out there now, Camp Chaffee   s  got the town where I was born, but around there. But that little old town  around there was just a little thing where we just born, out in the country  there. Bloomer, a little shop, little country store you know. They called it  Bloomer. Didn   t have a railroad track through there, but that   s     anyway, is that okay? (Laughs)  That   s fine. I   ve just never heard of Bloomer,  Arkansas .  (Laughs) Well, it   s just a little store there you know.  Sure. What did your parents do for a living?  They farmed.  And what did they farm?  5  Merritt  Bishop  Finchum  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Well, we moved from Arkansas to Oklahoma, and I think that   s mostly  when my dad did the farming. I don   t know, I don   t think he   I think he  bought a little farm there at Bloomer. But then moved to Oklahoma and  there we farmed   he farmed, in Maysville  Oklahoma . His sister was  here and so he and his brother drove a covered wagon with a team out  from Bloomer to Maysville, Oklahoma. Took about three weeks, I think  and brought a covered wagon and their stuff, what they had, in it then.  Then the family moved   I mean, came in a car, came in a Model T or  Model A or whatever you call them. (Laughs)  You went in the car?  Yeah, we were in the car, me and my mother and brother and sister and  all. We all came out there then to Maysville, Oklahoma.  Story, in Story, you were in     Story, yeah, Story. Story is very important. (Laughs) It was a church  house and a store and another little store now, a blacksmith shop and  everything. Papa bought a farm there and then he decided he liked a  little farm further north so he sold that one and went on about mile north  of Story and bought another 180 acres. So he made a living with that real  good and stayed with that and had a prosperous life. (Laughs)  Did he raise cattle or wheat, or what?  Mostly, at first just farmed the land you know, and plant corn and cotton  and things like that. Then later we had cows, pastures you know, and  had the cows in the pastures and things like that and milked the cows. I  milked the cows. (Laughs) I have a picture up there, it was in the paper,  me milking the cow. (Laughter)  Did you like it?  Huh?  Did you like it?  Did I like it? No. (Laughter) They took a picture, I don   t know who in  the world took a picture of me milking the cow and so   but anyway, it  worked okay. (Laughs) We did it anyway.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  I had two brothers and one sister.  6  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  And where are you in that order?  My older sister and then I   m next, my brother and then   wait a minute,  me and then my younger brother. He   s young, he   s eighty-six.  (Laughter) He   s still living. He   s the only one living.  Is he? Did the other two live to be 100?  No.  No?  Nuh uh. Nobody.  You   re the first?  Uh huh.  Well, that   s pretty cool.  Yeah.  So where did you go to elementary school, grade school?  Well, we had a little school   Story over there, you know, it had a little  church and school. Went there the first two years and then the next time  we moved a mile north, you know. Papa bought the farm and that was  another little French school and so I went there until I was in the eighth  grade. Then I went to high school at Maysville     And graduated what year?   In  1932.  In    32.  Anyway, we caught a ride with a boy. He picked up a few of us kids  around there, rode to school with him. I don   t understand, though, how  in the world we kept from freezing, because we didn   t have heaters. I  don   t know how we kept from freezing to death going to school, but we  didn   t. We made it okay.  How was the house heated, that you grew up in?  Oh, well we had propane and let   s see, I don   t think   I don   t know  7  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  about the wood   can   t remember that. Then I think we had some  carbide lights for a while, to go by. I don   t know   coal oil lamps you  know, had oil and you had to  take the  chimneys, had to blow in those  and clean them with paper. (Laughs) You   d shine them up so you can  see how to read you know, but that lasted for quite a little while. Then  we finally, later on after I got older, they put in some telephone poles  and put up telephone lines and put up electric lines and all that stuff. We  began to have electricity, but it was   I don   t know exactly how old I  was but I was on up. Had children, you know.  Already out of high school?  Yeah, and school and everything. I don   t know how, but they got by  with the lamp, just a coal oil lamp to read by at night.  What about running water?  Oh, well hmm. (Laughs) We didn   t know what that was. (Laughter)  Let   s see, we had a well and had to pump it. But anyway it was a long  time before we ever got conveniences and things like that.  Have an outdoor toilet?  Yeah, mhmm.  A one-seater or a two-seater?  Two. (Laughter)  As a matter of fact, I was in high school, wasn   t I, when we got first  indoor bathroom and running water, Mother?  What?  You were married when you got the running water and bathroom in the  house.  Yeah, mhmm, mhmm. Oh, you want to know what Papa   what he  brought out with him from Arkansas in the wagon?  Sure.  Well, I don   t know. It   s just essentials I guess. Couldn   t bring that much,  but I remember they didn   t have any roads, just terrible. Even from Ada   Oklahoma  and on up. I remember coming along and there   d be mud  holes. Have to go around the main road, to go around there, to get  8  Finchum  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  around to go on down the road because no gravel or anything. So Papa  and his brother stopped over east of Pauls Valley at a place to spend the  night and asked the lady if they could stop there with their horses and  everything. She said yes. The next morning she fixed their breakfast and  Papa gave her some of Mama   s canned blackberries for having them for  breakfast. I thought that was pretty good, that they   d taken in some  strangers from Arkansas, you know. Now you   d be afraid to even let  them in at the door. (Laughs)  Sure.  Mother, I have a question about Fort Chaffee. Your grandparents owned  the land where Fort Chaffee was built, right?  Yeah, I think so.  And so did that happen before you left Arkansas or after?  After.  After.  Mhmm.  Okay. Going back to   she asked you about running water. I think it was  the 50   s wasn   t it, before you had running water? I remember you were  very determined before Phyllis got married that you were going to have  a bathroom.  Oh  Yes, yes. We had to have a restroom before she got married.  (Laughter) So she couldn   t get married... (Laughs)  And so, I mean, if Mother hadn   t really pushed it I think we   d still  be   we had to carry water a long, long way from the well     Papa, Papa, he found some water. Somebody witched for some water.  Had something like this (gestures forked stick) they had to turn.  Whenever it   d turn that   s where you could find some water. (Laughs)  Oh yeah, I remember that.  And I remember that. So a man did that for Papa and they had to go way  down the hill, though, before he found a well. That   s where he drilled a  well, down there, and then pumped the water up to the house. It   s kind  of hard to do all that stuff.  9  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Finchum  Bishop  Merritt  Made laundry time fun I bet.  Oh laundry, After I married we   d had a big old pot and have to heat the  water, oh gosh, had to heat it outside there and get it hot. Then we   d  make our soap and we had lye soap and stuff   fixed lye soap and cut it  and have it in the pot and take it out. That   d be the soap we   d wash our  clothes with, you know. Then break the water because it would  be   because it was hard water it   d have to break, scum that off. Oh you  know, just a big mess. Get it all ready to wash and then, by golly, maybe  you didn   t have a clothesline on the line at that time, but there   s an old  dead fence over here. (Laughs) There   s a fence that had some wire on it,  just go over and throw your clothes over the fence and let them dry, by  golly. (Laughs) Oh, I don   t know. That was something else.  Then you started going to town for wringer washers.  Yeah, wringer washers. I   d go take my stuff to town and wash down  there, and then I   d get my hand in a wringer. It   d go plum in there and  then I   d have to pull it out, you know. It was going, and I remember I  had my hand in a wringer. Oh my goodness     Did it break your arm, Mom, when you got it caught in the wringer? I  remember you had to go to a doctor. Did it break your arm?  No, didn   t break my arm.  Oh.  Don   t think so. I don   t think so. (Laughs) I don   t know what I   m a  doing.  You   re doing great Mom  You   re doing great.  You   re doing great.  Growing up as a child, did you have any like traditions like Sunday  dinners, Christmas?  Oh, I love those  Thank you for mentioning that. I   ll tell you what was  fun for me, what I enjoyed. You know parents are very important  people. (Laughs) I think a lot, that   s what I think a lot, now my parents  are appreciated more. They were loving. My daddy was wonderful and  Mother, too. We would go to this little church on Sunday morning and  Mama   Papa would go out and take the chicken, wring it   s neck     chicken, and everything and dress and take it in the house. They   d singe  it over the fire or something and get the feathers off. Mama would cut it  10  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  up, fry it. Then she   d bake a pie, a chocolate pie or something. Then  when we went to church she had a dinner mostly ready and then they  would invite the preacher, because a visiting preacher didn   t live around  there. They   d come from Shawnee or somewhere over   trying out or  they would be doing you know, just they   d hire them wherever they  could get them. Then boy, Mom would always feed those preachers.  Boy, do you think they wouldn   t eat that dinner? Boy, they   d eat that  fried chicken like nobody   s business. (Laughs)  And homemade rolls   and homemade rolls.  Homemade rolls, yes. Then eventually, well my sister and husband and  family moved just about a quarter a mile from us there at that time at  Story, too. They went to the same church so we   d all go up to Mama   s  (that poor thing, what in the world) and had dinner. I don   t remember  saying,    I   ll bring pie, I   ll bring this.    She just went on and did it and we  just let her do it. I think about that, how terrible that was. (Laughs) Why  in the world didn   t we help her? She   d always like to do it though, that  was her thing. We just enjoyed   I enjoyed those years more than  anything with my family, raising them up, and going up to Grandma   s  and Grandpa   s and eating Sunday dinner. That was one of the highlights  of my life. (Laughs) Oh, I don   t know.  Did she have a big garden?  Yes. Oh lands yes, gardens, garden, garden, yep. We had fruit trees and  blackberry vines and all that stuff and all the good food. Even after I was  married we had a garden, and I remember I   d go out pick the  blackberries and I   d scratch my hands all to pieces. But anyway, and  have blackberry cobblers. But then also we had broomcorn Johnnies.  Whenever I was married we raised broomcorn. Some people didn   t  know what in the world broomcorn Johnnies were, but that was the  people that cut the broomcorn and got it prepared to go to town to take  care of whatever they was supposed to do. I would cook for the  broomcorn Johnnies. Right next to my house was a field of corn and  they   d go out   ladies, I   d hire them, a lady or two to help me. Oh, it   d  be thirty or forty hands. They   d get some corn and have fresh corn for  dinner, right out of the field there, and then we   d cook   had the  blackberries, had blackberry cobblers. We fed them good. Although,  they liked the red beans and cornbread. Those Johnnies would eat like  everything. (Laughter) I was telling somebody about the broomcorn  Johnnies, and they didn   t know what in the world we were talking about.     What is that?    You know what they did with the broomcorn?  No.  11  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Oh. Well, they cut   these are big stalks and it had   let   s see, I can   t  explain it. A lot of little things here, like a   well, what would you call  it   seed  Seeds in them  Seeds, little thing here go up, seeds, and then  they   d thrash that and that would be the broom. You know, like a broom  you     Sweep with?  Sweep with. That   s what it is. That would be the broom, the broom, but  the seed would be gone because the thrasher would thrash the seeds out.  Then, of course, the company would tie the brooms around and all that  stuff, but we raised the broomcorn. They   d break it, put it behind them     break it. Somebody   d come along with a knife here and cut the head off,  put it over there and another wagon would come along and they   d put it  on that and then they   d slide that off where they were going to thrash it  and thrash it. Then put it up in stalls and let it dry out and air out and  then bale it. Then they   d send it off to the company and they   d make the  brooms out of it. That   s what broomcorn   s about. (Laughs)  And then thereafter they quit doing broomcorn, Lindsay  Oklahoma   was the broomcorn capital of the world, I remember that     Yeah, Lindsay was broomcorn capital of the world.     And then what did Dad switch to? When he didn   t do broomcorn  anymore then what did he grow?  You mean Sam?  No, yeah. Daddy, yeah your husband, what did he grow then?  Oh well, he     Switched to?  Huh?  What did he switch to to make a living? When he couldn   t do it for  broomcorn     Alfalfa.  Alfalfa hay and     Alfalfa hay     12  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  And then also cotton.  Yeah, oh lands yes  Cotton. Break your back with an old sack of cotton  and     And people could come and live in the house down in the field     Yeah, big old        pick all the cotton     Bring up some people up from Pauls Valley, some black people, and  have them   we had little places out there for them. They could kind of  stay out there and they were at the back and kind of would make some  cornbread and eat whatever they wanted to eat and all. And they helped  to pick the cotton and weigh it   I mean, you have to weigh it and all  that stuff. Then you   d pay them for so much, you know, for picking the  cotton. Then they   d put it in bales and take it off to town and have it  gone through the   well, whatever it is     It was called a  cotton  gin. I don   t know what they did with the cotton.     and then they   d bale that, that   s cotton. So we did the cotton that way  too and then     And then he also, where he won his prizes, was for corn.  Oh, lands yes  My husband was good at making straight rows they said,  and this farm we had was a good farm. Let   s see, here on down the hill  down to the river almost, good farm land. He   d get in there and make a  row and they   d said,    Oh my land,    they knew Sam did the rows.  (Laughs) He would just not wobble. He   d make a straight row all the  way across that field and plant stuff like that, down the rows, and you  could see it, you know, how he planted it down in rows and everything.  Then also some of the neighbors and all would have fun in the alfalfa  patch. Sam would get in the pickup and some of the boys, neighbors and  all, they   d get in the backend of the pickup and be up there with their  guns and go rabbit hunting. Boy, those rabbits would come up out of that  field of alfalfa, you know. They   d shoot those rabbits like everything.  (Laughs) They had a bunch that liked to do that, you know.  How did you meet your husband?  My neighbor. We lived here, neighbor lived here, and his friend   s  girlfriend was my girlfriend and so they introduced me   him to me.  13  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Bishop  Merritt  This neighbor there, you know, and that   s it. He was supposed to be in  college, and I think he went about two years or so, but his brother passed  away. His brother was helping farm that 180 acres because his daddy  and mother were old and his brother was farming. So whenever his  brother died that made my husband have to quit college and come back  home and had to take the farm over...doggone it. (Laughter)  Mother, how far were the two farms, the Cook farm and the Merritt  farm? Each of them had 180 acres. How far apart were they? I mean,  you didn   t meet Daddy even though you were only two miles apart?  Yeah, just about two miles. But anyway, from then on we had to do the  farming, but I think it could   ve been better if he   d been a doctor.  (Laughter)  Where had he gone to college?  Oh, what?  Where had he gone to college?  Me, gone to college? I didn   t go to college. (Laughs)  No, where did your husband?  Oh, OU. Yeah, I went through high school.  He was about five years older and he graduated from high school at  fifteen, so that   s why they didn   t meet until later. It   s really a shame  because all of his other brothers and sisters got to graduate from college.  But he was the one that had to go home and do the farm, so he had to  drop out of medical school.  Where did you go elementary school?  I went to French School which was about a mile and a half, two miles  north of Story. Here   s Story, we lived a mile north of Story, and the  school was just right over there, a little country school. They went to the  eighth grade. They were lovely teachers, a man and his wife. I remember  that they had to help take care of some of those kids that come to school.  They would be such nice teachers to help because some of those kids  were so poor they couldn   t even   some of the girls couldn   t even afford  bras. So the lady teacher made them some homemade bras and stuff like  that, you know. (Laughs) The man would just help the boys in basketball  and teach them the way, how to do and how to act and everything. Some  of them even became teachers and I think  it was  from their experience  14  Finchum  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  at the country school. They were wonderful teachers.  Even today I   m surprised at me. (Laughs) That lady the other day was  asking us, at our party, she was saying,    What   s eight times eight?    You  know, just questions, things like that. I never thought anything about it. I  knew just right quick. I don   t think anybody else knew. I learned those  from those little country schools. Seven times seven   s forty-nine   three,  you know, all those things. She kept asking some of those. Nobody  knew seemed like. Didn   t they learn those in school? (Laughter)  Not as well as they used to.  I don   t know how I remembered them though, but they just came to me  like that. They were very good teachers. They went through the eighth  grade there and then I went to high school four years.  Where   d you go to high school?  Maysville.  Maysville, okay.  Seven miles from home and     Did you drive?  I rode with a boy that was a neighbor     Oh yes, that   s right.  And he had a man, another boy with him, and then us. There was the  teacher, she had a sister that rode with us, another girl. We made it. All  five of us rode down there in that car.  That was kind of during the Depression years too     Yeah, it was which, you know, I didn   t know it was the Depression.  Really I didn   t. I see now   we wanted to take piano lessons and I  remember Pop said,    I just don   t think we can afford it.    It was during  the Depression. My sister cried and said,    Yes we can. We can afford  it.    Anyway, we went on and we took piano lessons and everything. I  didn   t know we was having the Depression because Mom and Papa   I  mean, Papa would kill hogs. They had a smokehouse. With a  smokehouse they had a thing inside where you light a fire and do the  meats you know, cure the meat. We had good fresh ham all the time  and   what am I telling now about that. Got off on to that     15  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Finchum  Bishop  Finchum  Wallace  Merritt  Depression.  Oh, Depression, yeah. Anyway, I didn   t know   I didn   t know we had a  Depression. I guess I should   ve said,    Oh well, I don   t need to take  piano, you know. That   s okay.    But I didn   t say anything. I just didn   t  know the difference I guess. Just went on and thought Papa could pay it  but I   m sure it took every penny he had, maybe, to do it. (Laughs) Then  now I can   t even do one thing      I dropped my dolly in the dirt. I asked  my dolly if it hurt, and this is what my dolly said, yeh, yeh, yeh.     (Laughter)  She gets more than that.  That   s all I remember. Oh I don   t know, but really I didn   t know  there   s   and Mama would take a pattern and she would take a paper and  lay it on the bed and cut out a pattern for a dress and fix it up, pin it  together, and then cut out some material and make us dresses like that.  She   d order it out of the catalog and it   d be beautiful. I   ve got some  pictures, just beautiful dresses she   d make. Maybe velvet down here, and  some kind of crepey stuff up here, stitching here, and all that stuff. They  were beautiful things, but that was during the Depression. But we made  it and looked nice.  And how   d you get your shoes?  Huh?  I think your shoe story   s interesting. How did you get your shoes?  Your shoes.  Your shoes.  Shoes.  Who bought you your shoes?  (Laughs) Papa would take my foot and put my foot down like that and  he   d go around my foot and take down to Mr.   Mr. P.M. Cate   s store  and then fit me with some shoes. (Laughs) Papa, sometime he had to go  in a wagon because they had a separator, a cream separator, when they   d  milk the cows and separate the cream from the milk. He   d go in that  wagon and take that downtown and some of the eggs that they had there  too you know. I don   t remember him doing that too much, but he did, he  did take some things like that to town and come back and buy the  16  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  groceries down there and shoes. I remember I had lovely shoes. Some of  them were kind of little   black patent around there, and then little tan  leather up. You know, lace up   little lace   and they were lovely shoes.  (Laughs)  How often would you get new ones?  Well I don   t remember. I don   t know.  Once a year or when school started?  Yeah I think so, something like that yeah. But I   ll tell you what, we ate  good though. That   s one thing, we ate good. We had a garden and I  canned. I canned jars upon jars upon, you know, beans and things. Then  I belonged to Farm Woman   s club and we went to the fair and made  some things. I made a ribbon on my first dress I made at the fair  because, I don   t know why.  Because you were good   (Laughs)  She took after her mother. She could really sew and cook.  What kind of dress was it? Do you remember the color of it or     What is it?  What kind of dress was it? What color was it?  You should   ve been to our hundred     Celebration.  Celebration. Kay Wren had these dresses lined up that I made whenever  she was in high school and after she got out of high school. Lovely  dresses, I   d forgot about them. I   d get the material and make them and  she kept them. She had them stored out in California and whenever she  came back this summer, she brought those dresses with her and they  were just perfect. Buttonholes were lovely made   buttons, I made the  buttons and everything. I could not believe I did that. But anyway     You didn   t go to California during   family or yourself   you didn   t go to  California during the Depression like a lot of Oklahomans. You stayed?  We stayed right there on that farm. Papa paid it off where other people,  17  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  maybe, used loans. He had loaned some to his brothers and loaned some  to this, that, and the other. He was a worker. He   d get up at four o    clock  maybe, and he would get the team, no tractors, get the team fixed up and  get up maybe by daylight and be out in the field. That   s the way you had  to do it to make it, because you didn   t have those big old tractors to plow  and do it for you. He paid off the farm and helped other people too.  They were lovely people. (Laughs) You know I don   t even remember  them fussing at me and I don   t remember them spanking me. I know I  needed it. I can   t even remember them  doing that . That   s something  now, isn   t it? I just cannot do that. I was thinking that the other day, how  lovely. They just didn   t fuss at you. You just obeyed and you just, you  know whatever. I don   t remember   yeah, I don   t.  I know whenever we had to go hoe cotton or something or another,  here   s the house, way up there about three quarter a mile was where  we   d have to go to hoe the cotton or pick the cotton or whatever. But did  you know, I thought about this, gosh would we do that today? I wouldn   t  let my kids do that, walk up that far and walk back. So we   d walk up  there and hoe until time to eat dinner. We   d walk back home down there  and eat and go back. Why they didn   t say,    We   ll take you,    why we  didn   t even think of that. That was impossible to think you   d take the kid  to work in the field up in a car you know. They didn   t take us to school  either. (Laughter) Little distance, you know, little distance, but they  didn   t think about that. Now, why I   d stick them in there the minute they  got out the door. They didn   t do that then.  Would school get out in time for you to harvest     Huh?  Did school let out so that you could pick cotton?  Sometimes it did, I remember. Summertime they would. I remember the  teacher came by and we were out in the field right by the road pulling     picking cotton. We were picking cotton because we had help get it   get  it, out of the field you know. But he saw us and well, that   s okay  because he knew what we were doing. (Laughs)  Where would you take the cotton to market?  Take the cotton seven miles down to Maysville and they ginned it down  there. We run it through the gin. Maysville had about two or three gins  then, now they don   t have anything like that anymore. (Laughs) They  don   t even raise cotton much anymore. Well they do but not like they  did there then.  18  Finchum  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Well after all that work what would you do for fun?  Well, that   s a good question.  What type of entertainment did you do for family or     Oh well, on Sundays we   d go up to   we   d go to church, a little church  there. Some of us kids would get together, girls and the boys, and Mama  would have some cake and stuff for us in the afternoon. We   d just kind  of walk around, up to the store and back, and just piddle around. Didn   t  go much   we just didn   t drive those cars any. (Laughs) What  entertainment?  Did you play music or was there any music?  Oh well, yeah well they had some singing, and all the girls took piano  lessons and all that. Now that was later on. We were busy, busy, busy  then taking them to music, you know my kids, after they grew up. We   d  go to Lindsay  Oklahoma  or somewhere else, take all that girl stuff.  (Laughs)  You talked about a radio last time     Oh yeah that radio. One time a man lived down the road about a quarter  a mile, and Papa bought a radio, oh he loved this fiddling music. I called  it fiddling music, whatever. He   d do that fiddle and he   d run up to  Papa   s and he   d move his chair right up there by that thing. He   d get his  ear in that and boy would he enjoy that fiddle music; he   d just eat it up.  (Laughs) Yeah and then eventually the Light Crust Doughboys did come  to Story. You don   t know about them because you   re not old enough to  know anything about them. But that was a big band came out to Story     What was their name again?  Light Crust Doughboys.  Light Crust Doughboys     (Laughs)  What was it again?  Huh?  What was it again?  19  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Light Crust Doughboys  I think that was it.  Oh, okay.  But anyway, there were others too that came, but oh the whole  community came out and heard them play, you know, there at those two  little stores. Then when I married, we lived a mile east of Story with my  family. We got the first TV in that community and Grandpa Merritt, he  lived right there by us, he   d come and say,    Is that those people in there?  You see, is that those people in there?    (Laughter)  But anyway, after they got the telephone lines up and all that stuff and  then the telephone, you know. You probably heard all the stories about  the telephone. R-i-n-g, ring, ring, ring, you know, and then everybody on  the line knew it was you   whoever they were calling and here  everybody would go listen, listen, listen. (Laughter) One big ring or one,  two was your ring or maybe two little ones was somebody else   s. You  didn   t care whose it was you wanted to go hear what they had to say,  because you could hear everybody on the telephone. Oh gosh, what life.  You would be scared to say anything private.  Yeah. (Laughter) I bet you they got their ears full a lot of times though.  (Laughs)  There were eight party lines weren   t they? Weren   t there eight people on  a line together?  Yeah, I think so, yeah. Oh my, how terrible. Wasn   t that awful? What  life.  You said you were a member of a homemaker club?  Oh yeah, a home demonstration club. We   d all meet, a group of us, and  we would discuss canning and we   d take our things to the fair, our  wares, you know, and can and win prizes and stuff. But then there was  another home club I belonged to that was very nice. It was a state one  and we, my friends around here, we would meet every so often and have  a topic that we   d like to talk about. Then we would bring a picture and  show that and discuss it. But that was a state thing and then we would  report to the state different things and then we would help the people,  the poor people and stuff, you know, with our little offerings and stuff  like that. I belonged to that club, but it was nice to meet with the ladies  and they were so   I had the best group of women you ever saw in your  life. There was about a dozen of us. I wished I had a picture to show  20  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  you. The nicest women there ever was and they were all intelligent and  nice and friendly and did things together. We just enjoyed life like that  so much.  What was the name of it, do you remember?  Oh, (laughs) I think it was Story Neighbors is one and     What was the one you   d go like to the conventions in Stillwater? What  was the name of that one?  Well you know, I can   t remember. It was     You belonged to two and I can   t remember the names of them either.  Yeah, it was some kind of home demonstrations and like that, but it  wasn   t exactly     Yeah, both of them were demonstrations, but it was     Yeah I know it, but I can   t remember exactly what that one was that was  so nice. You   d meet people there and things like that. We   d, you know,  everybody liked everybody and they were all   and I don   t have a soul. I  think there   s one living now, one person my age   not my age. (Laughs)  Anyway, not any of those people are living anymore. But I still got a  picture of them and I remember them. They were my life at that time  when I was raising kids. That   s our recreation, you know. We   d get to  do that.  Did you make a quilt with them?  Huh?  Did you make a quilt with them?  Oh yes, yeah. I wished you had the picture of those things to show. This  picture down here, get one to show, and whatever they had the biggest,  nicest opening for me on my 100th birthday. Donna had displayed things  that I had made for her during my lifetime and Kay Wren brought those  dresses all the way from California. I can   t believe it. Those on a wire  stretched there at this church where we had this opening and showing all  these things that we did.  For instance, like she makes all kinds of pillows and Christmas items  and all     21  Merritt  Bishop  Wallace  Finchum  Wallace  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Let them see.  Oh my gosh.     and then all the dresses over here and then they had pictures of all  these different things that she did and even here are some of the women  in some of the home demonstration clubs. You know, and quilts and     Very talented.  Yes, we just had, you know   I mean anything there was to do, Mother  could do it. So we just had a lot of that on display for her 100th.  Where would you get your fabric?  Oh, down at Pauls Valley.  Pauls Valley.  Well, tell her where my dresses were made from?  Huh?  What were my dresses made from when I was little?  What?  The flour sacks   (Laughter)  She   d take me   were they flour sacks?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, they were. I didn   t make you too many. But they     you know, they   d come     They were pretty.  Flour would come in sacks so people would use those to make their  clothes you know. They   d use the flour and then they   d make the dresses  out of them, yeah.  So she   d take me into this big, her brother ran the store, and we   d go in  and I   d pick out if I wanted the blue fabric or whatever. But then as the  years went on she bought really nice fabrics but     22  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Meritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Did you ever think about selling your clothes you made?  You know   no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I wished Kay Wren would get  shed of those. I can   t believe she   s still got them. (Laughter) Got those  out there   she had those packed and put away and paying on them out  there in California. Paying that guy to, you know, and she didn   t even  know she had it   forgot about them. She got out there and got   and she  said there was not one moth in them or anything. (Laughs)   OSU   s  Design, Housing and Merchandising would love to put those on  display. (Laughs)  Where are they now?  She took them back home with her   No, she left them at my house.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, but she will take them back. She still has a lot she didn   t bring. I  wouldn   t let her bring all of them     I cannot believe it     Oh my god. (Laughs)  I cannot believe it   She said she had them from high school, college     I cannot believe it.     later years.  But what got me was Mama would cut a pattern and I just   it   d be just  me, you know, just put a picture and it   d just fit perfect. She   d cut a  pattern and sew it up and I   d have   how they did it, I don   t know. That  was a job. Well I   m tired of talking. I know you are tired of listening to  me rattle on, you don   t know what I   ve said. I don   t know what I   ve  said.  No, no. You said you won some ribbons at the county fair. Was that  Garvin County?  Yeah, Garvin County. Sam   s sister was teaching at Pauls Valley. She  23  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  was an instructor and in the 4-H club, too. So I said,    I   d like to learn  how to do this properly.    So she showed me and I made me a dress and I  got it   where is that? It is in the picture somewhere   a blue dress. They  sent it to the fair, you know. I mean, I was standing there in my dress  that I had made and got first prize. First time I   d ever tried to make a  dress by myself, but she showed me how to do it properly. How to put  the hem in here and how to do this and how to do that and I did it all just  like she said, and I won first prize on it.  But you entered cakes and pickles     Oh, yeah.     and all kinds of things at the state fair, too.  Just recently the girls insisted that I enter the fair in Oklahoma City on  my divinity and angel food cake.  And pickles.  And pickles, yeah. I won some on those. I don   t know, first or second  prizes on them and so forth and so on.  In her nineties.  Huh?  You were in your nineties. You were in your nineties when you did that   How old were you?  Yeah, yeah. Huh?  How old were you?  When I did that?  Yes.  Oh just a few years ago, ninety-something. (Laughs)  But you also did it when you were younger, too.  Yeah, oh yeah I did it then.  But she was still doing it just not long ago.  24  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Finchum  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Yeah, oh yeah, I could still do it today. I   d like to fix you, if I could see,  I   d fix you some lovely divinity.  I   d eat all of it.  Oh boy, it   d be good too   It   s one of my favorites. (Laughs)  I   d rather have the pickles. (Laughs)  And a lot of people liked the angel food cake though. It   s square, I have  a square pan   a square pan for angel food, and then you put that icing  on it, it   s so good. People   s called me from Tennessee wanting to get my  icing recipe. (Laughs)  What makes a good icing? What was your secret recipe?  Huh?  What was your secret recipe for that icing?  Oh, icing? Oh that icing   Well, I   d get eight ounces of cream cheese,  cut it in half, four for that little cake. It   d be four ounces and then two  tablespoons of butter and some flavoring and what else?  Powdered sugar, powdered sugar.  Powdered sugar. Yeah, yeah, and so that   s what it was.  What about all those freezers of ice cream you used to make, too?  Oh     Homemade ice cream?  Oh my goodness, yes. We made ice cream. We put the milk in there and  the eggs (and they froze) and mix your eggs and your milk and your  flavoring. Of course, a lot of vanilla and stuff and then put some ice. Oh,  you   ve done that.  Mhmm.  You know, yeah, that   s nothing new to you   and then freeze that you  know.  25  Finchum  Merritt  Bishop  Finchum  Bishop  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  People just don   t do that anymore though.  No, no.  They plug it in and let the machine do it today. (Laughter)  They go to Braum   s.  Or Braum   s, yeah. (Laughs)  Yeah, Braum   s is good. Oh, I don   t know. Life can get complicated and  yet it can be something   and something to look back and see all the  good things too, you know. People are good in the long run.  Was the Dust Bowl an issue where you were?  No. I know it bothered Mama when we came to Oklahoma, because she  didn   t have any dust back there at all and she moved out there. She  couldn   t get used to the dust   was blowing some there at Story, you  know and it really did get her. (Laughs)  How did they come to pick Story as the     Well you know, I don   t know. I think of this a lot of times, why didn   t I  ask more questions to Papa and find out more? Didn   t think about it. His  sister was here. Now how she got out here, I don   t know, Papa   s sister.  He had about ten in the family. I don   t know how she   they got  there .  They had a place right west of Story, nice little place over there and so  then he just moved us close to Story, too.  What about Okla and Homa?  Oh, yeah.  Did they come before Papa came? Did their parents come   the first  twins born in Oklahoma were called Okla and Homa  Henry . Did they  come before Papa came?  I don   t remember, I don   t know.     Okla lived to be 100. Okla was a centenarian.  Is that right?  Mhmm.  26  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Bishop  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Well     Just recently deceased.  Well anyway     She was closer to Okla and Homa   s sisters. Weren   t you? Opal and     We named one Okla and one Homa. (Laughs) Oklahoma   1918   what?  When was it?  I can   t remember. No.  In 1912, 1913, it was later  1908 .  But   so therefore, we stayed there and we   re still there except I   m not  there (laughs), not there anymore.  The farm is still in the family?  Huh?  The farm is still in the family?  No. Finally got a shed of it not too long ago. But yeah, I   d walk up there  and then we   d hoe awhile and then I   d walk back home and eat my  dinner and then go back there. How did we do it? I didn   t fuss about it,  we didn   t fuss about it.  Did you ever travel anywhere?  Oh we went to California a time or two. (Laughter). Down to Sulphur   Oklahoma . (Laughter)  That was a fun place.  And now I   m back to Arkansas, but you know it   s so far to go back to  Arkansas. We could hardly make it back there whenever somebody died,  because it was so far from Maysville, Oklahoma to Fort Smith   Arkansas .  Mhmm.  Wasn   t that something else? Wasn   t that something, it was a long ways.  Why didn   t I go back and visit my uncle when he was in the hospital  27  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  there? I could   ve gone down in one morning and back. Don   t think I  ever visited him. It   s so far to go down there. Oh gosh, life can be  complicated.  What do you think is the secret to your longevity?  Well   I don   t know, just getting up and working every day. (Laughs) I  just   I never did sit around much, I just kept a going. I don   t know  whether I did or not. (Laughs) I don   t know, just     You told me that it was because you always had something to look  forward to.  Yeah.  You know, you were one that just kept on going, kept on going     Yeah, yes. Something else, something new, something   you know  always coming along, something new. But I don   t know now, in here, I  feel like I don   t know. What can I do to improve in myself? I don   t  know.  Did your husband have to go to World War II?  No. He was farming. Oh he made   I forget now how many bushels to  the acre. What was that?  I can   t remember. He won the state prize. He had the most bushels per  acre of corn.  Uh, corn, uh huh and he won state you know   corn. Maysville FFA   Future Farmers    of America  boys would come out and they   d pull his  corn off and then take that and put that for them to demonstrate for  themselves. (Laughs) Take some of his corn and put it to the fair too.  (Laughs) Oh gosh, I don   t know   but he made so many bushels to the  acre. I don   t know what it was. He won state. I   ve got some silverware  from that.  By that time he was using a tractor I hope.  Yeah, I think so. (Laughs) Yeah he was, he was using it, yeah. But those  boys really did get a bang. They still remember him a getting   running  down that alfalfa patch and they   re going like mad going after those  rabbits. That   s kind of dangerous back there in that back of the pickup  with that gun wasn   t it, but I guess they were careful. I don   t know. Well  I guess I   ve told all I know.  28  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  No, just about. What were holidays like? Christmas, Thanksgiving, what  were they like?  Oh we had fun. We   you know my sister had girls just like me. I had  girls and then she had girls and we were close together and everything.  So we always got together and had fun doing things together and going  places together and everything. All activities were the same and so forth  and so on. They were about in the same grades and so it was just a  family affair kind of, you know.  Did you have a favorite decade? Do you have a favorite decade?  No.  No.  I don   t guess     The 20   s or the 30   s or the 40   s or     Huh?  Isn   t your favorite the 20   s or the 30   s or the 40   s or the 50   s? You   re  elementary, your high school, your married years?  Oh, I don   t know.  You liked them all.  I liked them all.  How did you celebrate your birthday? What was it like to turn 100?  When I was 100?  Yeah, what was it like to turn 100? What did that mean to you turning     making it your 100th birthday?  You know, I didn   t think much about it. It   s just another day, seem to me  like. It   s just 100, that   s it. I don   t know. It didn   t   wasn   t   didn   t get  excited. (Laughs) Just another day.  But people came from everywhere to celebrate with you.  Yeah, I know it. Yeah I had a nice time, about 100 and some odd people  29  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Bishop  but there would   ve been more but they had a storm down at Pauls Valley  and blew things down around. Some of them didn   t get to come. But  anyway, they had a table all fixed up. Oh and they   they ordered the  food the night before and the Pauls Valley was going to make the food  and bring it early the next morning. Make it that night and bring it   and  that storm came and it put out everything, the lights in Pauls Valley. All  the electricity went out and there was all the food that they had ordered.  Sandwiches and mints and I mean the things and everything from Pauls  Valley. So what did they do? They got on the telephone the next  morning and called Purcell  Oklahoma  and Purcell had to get busy early  that morning and fix all that stuff over for them because that   d spoiled,  you know, Pauls Valley. They were afraid it had stayed out all night  long and it   s gone and they wouldn   t have it. So had to do it over the  next morning and get it from Purcell down there. Had tables loaded, had  my pictures in it you know, and oh the cake   my pictures are down here  if you want to look at them. (Laughs)  Oh, then after they came in they   d say (and I was sitting here, they had  me sit there),    Go back behind her,    and they   d take a picture. So  everybody came, got behind me, and they snapped my picture so they  got a picture of everybody with me. Then they had a radio there, and it  was playing my favorite music. Like those old timey songs, what was it?     Oh Yes Sir, That   s My Baby    or something, I don   t know what it was.  Then that record was playing while they were looking at all those lined  up things. They had all those lined up across the wall there, my clothes  and the things that I   d made Donna Lou and all the winnings I   d done  and the pickling. They had them all labeled and all that stuff     Plus the video.  Huh?  We also had the video of you from baby to   you know, the video?  Yeah, yeah. Well anyway     No secrets that day.  Hmm?  No secrets left after that day.  Nuh huh. Oh my goodness     What would you say is your philosophy or motto in life? What do you  live by? What   s your motto that you live by?  30  Merritt  Finchum  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Do the best you can today and not worry about it tomorrow. (Laughs)  That   s just what I made up. That may not be it. That may not be it.  Sounds good to me.  If history were written today what would you want it to say about you?  Do what now?  If history were written today, what would you want it to say about you?  Well she did the best she could, with what she had, where she was.  That   s not a good answer, but (laughs)     No, it   s good.  You survived didn   t you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where do you consider home?  Home?  Uh huh. Where do you consider home?  Well I consider Maysville.  Maysville.  Strong Christian values meant a lot to you, too.  Yeah. Yeah.  How important was religion and spirituality?  Hmm?  How important was religion and spirituality in your life?  Oh, it   s very important. See we started when we came to Story. That  little church there, it wasn   t even a room. It was just one little old white  church. But anyway, that   s where we started and all my family was  saved there and baptized in the river. They baptized them in the river,  didn   t have the baptistery.  31  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Bishop  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  What was the name of the river?  Washita.  Washita River.  And it was muddy, you know kind of muddy. But anyway, go down  there and be baptized. This is a funny tale. This little lady, she was real  nice. The church had a door in the east and then the ladies    dresses were  thin. They were made out of voile, and I can   t exactly place this exactly  how it happened but I know she complained because whenever they  came to church on Sunday morning the sun was coming in at ten  o   clock. It was early and the sun would be shining and you could see  maybe that petticoat or whatever it was they had, they called a petticoat,  it would be so thin and her dress so thin that you   d see the prints of her  legs, you know. That was murder to see the print of a leg through that.  So she had them to move that   and they moved it on the north side so  that she could come in church and     Moved the door.     not have to see through her thin dress there. (Laughs)  She had the door moved.  She literally had the church move the door? They had to move the door?  (Laughs)  Yes.  That   s the truth  (Laughter)  She must have a lot of power.  I didn   t do that   they did that, the church did that. If that lady, she was  you know   yeah that   s it. That was funny too.  Is that Ms. Carson?  Yeah.  How did she have so much power to get that done?  Well because Horace Carson was the money man. (Laughter)  32  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Money talks. (Laughter)  That works every time. (Laughter) Anyway, they had that big   my  brother had a store there in Story, too. Different ones had stores there  and it was just a friendly place to go, and guys would play dominoes on  the front porch and then trade     Did he have a store name?  Huh?  Did his store have a name?  Story, Story     Just the     You know I heard the other day   and it   s been gone so long that they   d  done away with the buildings and everything, but the other day the  newsmen called Story. It was raining at Story, Oklahoma. (Laughter) I  don   t know how they drug that up, but anyway. Well I don   t know what  I   ve left out. But anyway, whatever.  Do you remember voting for the first time? Voting?  Well, I don   t know   I kindly do and think   but yeah. I worked for the  election board about forty-five years in McClain County as a clerk and  then I sold some Tupperware to these people. (Clap) Then I was going to  Oklahoma City, oh my goodness alive  A lady,    You   re going to give  me a Tupperware party in Oklahoma City,    and I was down in Story. I  had that old, what kind of a car was it, something or another. I was  sailing down there to north of Story up there, going home from that,  supposed to have gone to that big old party up there at Oklahoma City,  in the edge of it. Doggone it, I don   t think five people showed up and  here I was sailing down the road, coming on down to my house. By  golly, there was some patrolman right there by me, right there, stopped  me. I was about a mile and so from my house. I said    Well, I don   t  know. I was just supposed to had a party and nobody came. I guess I   m  just mad and driving on home too fast.    But they didn   t give me a ticket.  (Laughter)  One other thing I think you need to add also Mom     Huh?  One other thing I think you need to add is the only reason Mother has  33  Merritt  Bishop  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  social security, even though it   s so small, is because you worked for the  fish lure factory.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn   t know that.  And worked enough   there you had to have so many quarters and  Mother wanted some social security or otherwise she wouldn   t have  Medicare or anything.  Yeah, I was out there one day at this house where I live and I was a  sweeping the sidewalk off.    Well what   s a matter with these people?  Talking about social security, what about it? I don   t have any.    Just  dawned on me, dawned on me I didn   t have any. Boy, I got busy then  and I worked, I don   t know how long it was, two or three years. I don   t  know if I worked that long or not. I think I get maybe  298 dollars of  social security. (Laughs)  And Medicare and Dad, being a farmer, didn   t have any so he had to go  on hers.  Huh?  I think that   s really interesting.  What   s that?  Well Dad, because he was farmer, didn   t have it     No.     and so he   after you got yours then he went on yours.  Yeah, yeah. So then of course when he died I didn   t get any. Shame to  say, I didn   t mean to be ugly like that, but I didn   t get any of his because  he didn   t have any. I said,    I was waiting to get a little bit of money off  that,    but he didn   t pay in enough.  But I think it   s interesting as how she got her social security. She went  out and got a job.  Yeah.  And where was the fishing lure company?  34  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Yeah.  Where was that located?  What?  The fishing lure company you worked for     Yeah.     where was located? Is that in Purcell or     Maysville.  Maysville.  Now I don   t know where it started, but that   s where he had us there  awhile, and then he moved on to Lindsay or somewhere else. It was a  pretty nice little outfit. I could make those things pretty fast. Of course  sometimes they wouldn   t get them tight enough and it   d leak and  everything. I did pretty good. I didn   t like my hands all messed up  though, the white glue and all that stuff, but it was pretty good. They   d  make some nice ones.  How old were you when you did that?  Oh I was married and had kids. Oh I guess they was in college, weren   t  you? (Laughs) I don   t know.  In your 50   s or early     Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In your 50   s.  Yeah, I mean she was on up there when she just decided     Uh huh. I decided I   d better get busy. I better get busy and make me  some social security and it came in handy. Wished it was a whole lot  more, I wished it was a whole lot more.  It   s not the social security; it   s the Medicare that you get because of the  social security.  Huh?  35  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Finchum  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Finchum  Her social security check isn   t anything, but at least you get the  Medicare. Otherwise she wouldn   t have that.  I don   t know whatever. I can   t understand anything anyway.  Just Medicare was the most important part of that   Medicare.  Medicare  Yes ma   am, yes ma   am, yeah. So I hope I can stay here  awhile so they won   t throw me out. (Laughs)  Is there anything left on your bucket list that you want to do and  haven   t?  No, I don   t guess. I don   t know.  No place you want to visit or something you want to do?  I don   t guess. I hadn   t thought about it. (Laughs)  Were you interested in politics?  No.  No.  I was going to ask you if you were a Bellmon Belle or helped with the  Henry Bellmon when he ran back in the 60   s.  Yeah, I liked him. But yeah.  What   s a typical day like for you today? What time do you usually get  up, what time do you go to bed?  I usually get up   look at the clock about 6:30 and 7:00, or somewhere in  there and get dressed. Now I go here and it   s just kind of boring because  you go eat breakfast, come back home. Go eat dinner, come back home.  Go eat supper, I call it, and that   s it. So unless I invent something to  make it more interesting I don   t know what I   m going to do. (Laughs)  What time do you usually go to bed?  About   well now listen, sometimes I   m tired at eight o   clock or nine  o   clock maybe or something like that, because I   m tired by that time.  You need a sewing machine.  36  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  I got a sewing machine. (Laughs)  You need to use your sewing machine then. (Laughs)  I know, I got a piano too and I   ll declare I forgot that little old diddy. I  was in there the other day and I was thinking, and I hadn   t touched that  piano in how many months? Three, four, five   I can   t even remember  that little old chord I played. That makes me so mad.  It   ll come back.  Well I don   t know, I don   t know. I had a pretty good little piece up there  I learned one time you know, down there. I was taking from a lady at  Maysville and I could play that thing. Why didn   t I keep that going and  do that?  Well Mother at my house you   d go in there and sit down and play. In  church   and hymnals, you played the hymnals. Didn   t you play at the  church for a while?  Well yeah, but gosh poor people. I bet they thought,    What in the heck.     (Laughter)  No, you were good  She would play the piano and her brother led the  singing. Harold would lead the singing and you   d play the piano   in  church.  What about it?  You played the piano     Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And your brother led the singing?  And my brother led the singing. I can see that old song today. He didn   t  know but one song and I think I knew one. (Laughter) I think I knew one  piece. (Laughter) No, I think about that. Boy that sure is a familiar old  piece, that song. We wore it out. No, I think we did a little better.  What was it?  Well you know what, I   ll tell you whenever I think about it long enough,  but right now I can   t remember.    What a Fellowship    or something like  that. (Begins singing)    What a fellowship, what a joy divine.    (Laughs)  37  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Leaning on the everlasting arms, yeah.  Yeah, I think that was it. (Laughs)  I know that one, that   s a nice one.  Oh boy.  When you were taking piano lessons as a youngster did you have a  piano in the house?  Oh yeah, and I had one. It was terrible though, me. We had French doors  from the living room to the dining room and it was so cold. We didn   t  heat the whole house so I   d freeze in there and I didn   t practice, see? I  wouldn   t practice because it was too cold in there. They ought to have  spanked the britches off of me and made me get in there and practice on  those pieces you know.  Where did Papa get the piano, do you know?  Huh?  Where did Papa get the piano, do you know?  No. I know where I got mine though and I paid for it. (Laughter) I want  to sell it now. Oh gosh, I don   t know.  So what do you plan to do for your 101 birthday?  Oh just whatever I   m doing I guess. (Laughs)  How many children did you have?  I had three   three girls and they all went to college. They all took piano  lessons and they all did this, and they all did that, and I sewed for them.  They   d go to college and they   d have to have a dress the next morning to  wear somewhere to prom or something or another. I   d have to sit up all  night long and fix their dress for them to wear the next day   I   d get up on Saturday morning and she   d make me a dress to wear out  on a date that night.  Phyllis was over in Germany with her husband and she was playing  piano with some of those men, singing and everything. She said,    I  thought I was so dressed up.    I had made her a dress and I made a form.  I had a form and I put around her and I cut it and then I had it there at  38  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Wallace  Bishop  Wallace  Bishop  Wallace  Bishop  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Bishop  Wallace  Merritt  home, and I can fit her you know. She said,    Oh I felt so proud of that  dress. I looked so good in that dress and I was up there playing for those  guys,    and I just   top of the world. (Laughs) Oh my, but anyway     And then my other sister was on    Price Is Right    and you   d made the  dress that she wore on the program    Price Is Right   .  Yeah, that   s right. She wiggled her way around, I don   t know how in the  world she     Who is this?  My other sister was on    The Price Is Right,    and she says she really felt  like it was because of the dress that she wearing that Mother had made     How long ago was she on    The Price Is Right   ?  Oh, it was in the 50   s.  The 50   s. That   s with Bob Barker.  Yeah.  That   s     And she won a prize     She won a prize.  She thought   and she said   if you read that article there, that the Daily   Oklahoman  put out it says   tells about that. It said that she   what was  I gonna say about it? (Laughs) I don   t know what I was going to say  about it.  She won a gold lam   bathing suit and     Oh she said they told her,    If you smile, you might get to be on    and  Kay Wren said,    I just smiled, my mouth just stretched all the time I was  there,    (laughter)    and I got on.    Then after she got on she won some  things   little things.  You made the dress that was on TV.  Right.  Mhmm.  39  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Bishop  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  And Kay still has it. (Laughter)  Oh, I   ll tell you.  Been a good life.  But I didn   t know what she was doing all up there by herself. I can   t  believe I let her go  I don   t know how come   she was a teacher then  and knew how to get around I guess. But I don   t know how we made it,  but I guess we made it okay. But I tell you, I know one thing though, we  ate well. Now they talk about this kosher food stuff and all, we raised it  right out of the garden you see and it was good food. Fresh, you know,  good food and all. We had our fruit trees and we had our berry vines and  we had all the other stuff and we ate well.  Plus the cow     And hogs  Killed the hogs and ate the meat and had the milk and eggs so  we ate well.  And you worked it all off.  Yeah, yeah I did.  I think that   s the main thing. Work, work, work     Except I weighed 104 when I got here and in two weeks I weighed 110.  (Laughter)  Oh my gosh. (Laughter)  Oh boy. I ate, didn   t I? Oh my   well I didn   t have an appetite I guess. I  just didn   t. Okay     What   s the biggest challenge today being 100? What   s the biggest  challenge?  Oh just     The vision?  Huh?  Your vision?  40  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Wallace  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Merritt  Finchum  Yeah. Oh yes, that   s just terrible. That   s just   it   s just awful.  When did you give up driving?  Oh, about eighty-nine. (Laughs)  Willingly gave it up?  Huh?  Did you willingly give it up?  Yeah, I guess   no.  Well, she used to drive to Oklahoma City and I was concerned, and one  day she came in and she says,    I don   t believe I can drive up here  anymore.    It was the left hand turns that bothered you, not the right but  the left.  How old was I?  Well, you know you   I think you were in your late 80   s, Mom. It hadn   t  been that long ago. (Laughs)  Yeah, yeah. Mhmm.  You know     I think I could still drive if I had my eyes. I   d run over you. (Laughs)  And she still drove for quite a while, not to Oklahoma City, but she   d  drive to Maysville like to church and the beauty shop. Finally we  decided it wasn   t   and that hadn   t been that long ago.  Oh I miss that, oh I miss that.  Independence, yeah.  Yeah. Well, life changes and you got to do the best you can with what  you got today as I said. Okay?  Okay. We can end on that if you wish...  Yeah that   s fine.  All right. Thank you for sharing your story with us.  41  Merritt  Finchum  Thank you for listening to my junk stuff. (Laughs)  Oh, you were great   -------  -------
