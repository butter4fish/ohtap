 Finchum  Pierson  Today is June 26, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum, I   m with Oklahoma  State University and I   m here  in Oklahoma City  today with Russell  Pierson and this is part of our  Oklahoma  100 Year Life project. Along  with us is Sara Bolin and Alex Bishop. Thank you for having us today.  Yes, ma   am. You   re quite welcome.  Let   s start with learning a little bit about your childhood beginning with  when and where you were born.  Well, I was born December 15th, 1911 on a farm about three miles north  of Mangum, Oklahoma on land that my great-grandmother filed on  when they opened up this country.  What was her name?  Her last name was Cannon. First name, I believe, was Elizabeth.  It was unusual for a woman to have land, at that point.  I don   t know. Might have been.  Might have been.  With these pioneer women, you could expect near anything out of them.  Well, where did you go to elementary school?  Do what?  5  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Elementary school.  Elementary? Well, my introduction to elementary school was in the  community about a mile and a half from our farm, a little one-room  school called    Push   , P-U-S-H.  And how many were in your class?  I don   t have any idea. My memory wouldn   t go back that far. (Laughs)  But I probably was the only one in the  grade , because it was a small  school, one room.  And what did your father do for a living?  My father, early in his teenage years, was a farm kid and also a part-time  cowboy. Then as he matured, he started farming on his own.  So you grew up on a farm?  Yes ma   am. I grew up on a farm.  What were some of your chores?  What were my chores? Well, you did whatever was to be done. I helped  milk. Back around most farms they had a few beef cows. They had some  dairy cows. They were usually Jerseys so they   d have a little cream  check. They separated the milk and had a cream check for when they  went to town on Saturday, and that was when we bought the groceries.  They   d hope there   d be enough cream and eggs to go to the produce  house and pay for the groceries for the next week. Of course, they had a  lot of groceries, you might say, as they grew them right there on the  farm. My mother canned  thousands  of jars of vegetables, fruit, and  meat.  And did you have a favorite thing that you liked to do for fun?  For fun? (Laughs) Depends on what age. At eight or nine or ten I guess  you   d have to say    hide-and-seek    was the main one, the main fun that  the kids had when they got together there in neighborhood. Also, we  only lived about a mile or so from the river and swimming was a very  active participation.  And was religion an important part?  Religion?  6  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Yes.  Yes. It certainly was. My parents set a good example.  Well, in high school what did you think you would want to do when you  grew up?  Well, there wasn   t any question in my mind during those high school  days. I was very active in athletics. I was not very big, only weighed  about 135 pounds, but I took to distance running at an early age and I  was reasonably successful at it in high school competition. So I was  determined that I was going to be an athletic coach, but I got my mind  changed about that. About two weeks before I went off to college at  A M, Oklahoma A M, my dad and I had been to town in the farm  wagon. And on the way back home he said,    Son,    he said,    You   re  going to have to make up your own career.    He said,    I know you want  to be an athletic coach because you   ve been fairly successful as an  athlete, but if I could have my way, I   d like to see you study up at  Oklahoma A M to be what Mr. Georgia is.     Well, Mr. Georgia was our county agricultural extension agent.    No, I  want to be an athletic coach.    Well, he said,    That   s for you to make up  your mind, but we farmers could use a lot of help, and county extension  agents have the information that we need. I   d still like for you to train  yourself to be a county extension agent, because we farmers could use a  lot of help.    I went on to A M. I enrolled in the physical education  major, but what my dad had said to me just kept ringing in my ears.    I   d  like to see you study to be what Mr. Georgia is, a county agricultural  agent.    So after I   d been enrolled in physical education for about two  weeks, I switched majors and jumped over into agriculture. I   ve never  been sorry that I made the change. It hasn   t been a rich life, but it   s been  a very good life.  How had you decided to go to Oklahoma A M to begin with?  Well, we were farm folks, and I had a relative who lived in Stillwater  and her husband owned a small caf  . And he said to me,    Russell, if  you   ll come to A M, I   ll give you a job at my caf  , for your meals.     Well, that guaranteed me the opportunity to go to college, that   s for sure,  and I went on up to A M. I enrolled in physical education as a major,  but my dad, what he had said to me on that wagon trip back from town  that day, a couple of weeks before school started, I just couldn   t get that  out of my head.    Son, if I had my way I   d like to see you study to be a  county agricultural agent like Mr. Georgia.    So two weeks after I   d  enrolled at A M, I switched to agriculture. I   ve never been sorry.  7  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  And what did your dad say when you told him you had switched?  Well, he was pleased but he wanted me to do what I needed to do. He  wasn   t highly educated but he sure was a smart guy.  Were you the first in your family to go to college?  No. My sister, who was six years older than I was, she enrolled in  college. I guess she was training to be a teacher but she didn   t stay with  it.  So you were the first to graduate from college then?  Yes, I was the first one among a whole raft of cousins. I was the first one  to graduate from college.  Do you remember driving your first tractor?  My first tractor, you might say, was a pair of mules, either that or a  Percheron. My dad raised Percheron horses; big, black, maybe with a  white blaze and some white feet, but mainly black. What prompted that?  I don   t know what your question was.  Do you remember your first tractor?  Well, we didn   t have a tractor when I was a kid. We worked horses and  mules, as did just about everybody else. I   ll bet there was not a dozen  farm tractors in Greer County when I was a kid. About the only tractor  we   d see would be when they   d bring the threshing machine to our farm,  and that was a big old tractor that burned either coal or wood, to furnish  the power. But the farm tractors used in cultivating a crop, there weren   t  many  Everybody used horses and mules.  Do you remember the mules    names?  (Laughs) Well, if he was what we call a horse-mule, his name would be  Jake, and a mare-mule probably Judy.  What was the favorite food that your mother cooked for you?  Well, we didn   t have much choice. We grew it out on the farm, whatever  it was, but I liked those hot biscuits in the morning with butter on them  and a couple of fried eggs, sunny-side up, and even some ham or some  bacon, which was meat that we had cured when we butchered hogs.  8  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  That would be in cooler weather?  Yeah, sure. We waited until it was a cold spell, and we usually killed,  butchered, anywhere from two to five head of hogs, and the neighbors  did, too. And we all got together for the hog killing, and divided it,  whose ever place we were at, or we gave the neighbors some of the fresh  meat to take home with them. That was customary. That was the way  farm folks lived. You see, that was back in the 1920s.  Before electricity and running water.  Well, if we had any running water it   s because we spilled it coming up a  hill from the well. (Laughter)  That   s what I was thinking.  Then we went back and got some more. And no electricity, land sakes,  no. I was a county agricultural agent before they even tried to get  connections out to the farms there. In fact, by that time I was county  agricultural agent in Garvin County, Pauls Valley   s the county seat, and  I organized the meetings where the farmers decided whether or not they  wanted to have electricity. Most of them couldn   t afford it at that time,  but we got it started.  Rural Electric, REA?  Yes, that   s right, REA, Rural Electric, because the utilities didn   t want to  spend the money to get electricity out all over the country so we went  REA.  What were holidays like back in your childhood?  Holidays?  Yes.  Well, in the summertime, unless it was the Fourth of July, we didn   t take  any holiday. We went back to the field and worked. And schools around,  usually if there were any organized celebrations, why, we took part in it.  What about Christmas?  Oh, at Christmas, that was family time, and we always had a Christmas  tree out there on the farm. We usually had it at one of the grandparents     places, and we celebrated. My folks were quite religious. In fact,  Grandpa Pierson and Grandma Pierson helped to organize the First  9  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Baptist Church that was in Mangum. They were charter members at  getting it organized. So we celebrated Christmas with proper recognition  of what Jesus had in it, had low cost presents that Santa Claus brought,  we thought. It was good celebrations.  Did music play a part?  Well, it did. We   d sing. Yes. That might be the only music we had. A lot  of farm folks didn   t have musical instruments. They might have, might  maybe have a piano. We didn   t. We had an organ that you pumped to  get the wind through the organ. My mother was quite musical, and her  father had bought her an organ when they still lived in Illinois, and  brought it down to Greer County when they bought land down there, but  mainly it was singing.  And did you sing?  All the kids sang   Do you have a favorite song?  (Laughs) You   ve got to remember, you   re asking a question to which the  answer would have been ninety years ago.  Well even today, though, if you were going to sing something, what  would it be?  Whatever the grown folks wanted. It wouldn   t make any difference.  What about dancing?  Yeah, we all did, all of us did. The older folks did square dancing. Us  kids, I   m talking about anywhere from ten years old on up to fifteen and  eighteen, we did round dancing. I guess that   s what you call it. That   s  what we called it.  Do you remember your first car?  Absolutely. It was a 1925 Model T Ford touring car. We made a good  cotton crop that year. Papa bought a new automobile. We gave  523 for  it, brand spanking new, Ford touring car. We thought we were really in  high cotton. But by that time they had quite a few cars out in the  country.  So the main cash crop was cotton?  10  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Yeah, our main cash crop   everybody   s main crop was either cotton or  wheat, and we grew both of them.  And where would you take the cotton to market?  Well, hometown. We just lived three miles out of Mangum and they had  five or six cotton gins in Mangum so that   s where we took it.  Five or six?  Yeah, at one time we had   I think at one time there was seven cotton  gins in town.  Now there   s probably not even one.  Yeah, there   s   I think there   s still the one, Farmers Co-Op, which my  dad helped organize.  And was there an ice plant in Mangum?  A what?  An ice plant?  Absolutely. Most of the time we couldn   t afford it, but yeah, there was  an ice plant there. They made great big blocks of ice and pedaled it  around town to the places that needed ice and the families that needed  ice, and could afford it. Usually you didn   t buy over about a twenty-five-pound  block. Sometimes you   d get a fifty pounder, yeah. Because we  didn   t have electricity until, oh land sakes, there wasn   t electricity in  Greer County except for the plant there in Mangum, electric plant. There  wasn   t any electricity until the 1930s.  So once you got to Oklahoma A M, tell us a little bit about that. Where  did you live?  I lived in Hanner Hall. That was the new boys    dormitory. There was an  older boys    dormitory there called Crutchfield Hall, but I was lucky and  got a room, with a roommate, in Hanner Hall. And I guess until I started  baching in my senior year, I had the same room all the time there. Room  204. Cost me a fortune. Four dollars a month for my room, and I was  working for my board the first couple of years, and then I got a job with  the college as a student employee in my junior year, I guess it was. And  boy, us boys thought we were bankers, really, because we got fifteen  cents an hour working there in the cotton laboratory, fifteen cents an  hour. We were allowed to make twelve dollars and half a month. By  11  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  George, we got by on it. We didn   t buy any T-bone steaks at the  restaurant, anything like that. We finally got to where we bached. Did  our own cooking.  Did your own cooking?  Yeah. Yeah, well there was four of us boys together there, and one of  them did the cooking and the other three shared with the cost.  I take it you were not the cook.  I was not the cook. Well, I   d fry eggs and stuff like that, but as far as  cooking goes, we had one guy that was pretty talented that way and we  turned the cooking over to him.  Well, do you have a favorite memory from Oklahoma A M?  Oh yeah, you bet  I was a freshman. I had had a pretty good high school  athletic career in track. I was a distance runner, running everything from  the quarter-mile on up to two-mile, and was on the mile relay team. In  fact, I was the anchor on the mile relay team, ran the final lap. And I  guess my favorite surprise experience was when I was a freshman. I  knew I was going to  A M . I had a relative, I may have told you this  before, I had a relative who told me,    Russell, you   re going to graduate  this spring. If you go to A M, I   ll give you a job in my caf   for your  board.    Well, that   d guarantee an education so I took him up on it the  first two years, and then Depression hit and he finally went out of  business.  But, I had had a pretty good, pretty good career as a high school senior  in running distance races. So when the cross country team got time for  them to start practicing, which was even before school started there at  A M, I went out with them, and there was a varsity team. And back in  those days the freshmen could not compete in the varsity. You had to  wait until your sophomore year, but the varsity team got together and we  freshmen, who wanted to try to eventually make the team in our  sophomore year, we met with them that first day, first day of practice.  They said,    Oh, okay. Where are we going to run to today?    Well,  somebody said,    Well, why don   t we run out to the sheep barn and  back?    Well, it was about a mile and a quarter out to the sheep barn,  mile and a quarter back. So we ran out there, and it so happens that I had  been running all summer long, because I sure wanted to make the track  team at A M. So we ran out to the sheep barn and back, got back and  everybody was blowing just like a steam engine except me, because I  had been running all summer long out there in the buffalo grass pastures,  and I was in good shape. They said,    How come you   re not breathing  12  Finchum  Pierson  like everybody else?    Well, I said,    I   m not very out of wind. I   ve still  got my breath.    So that led to bigger things.  Well up into the season, in early November or late October maybe,  when I was outrunning all of varsity except for the top man, some of the  varsity guys came to me and said,    Russell, there   s a race that you ought  to run. You ought to run in that Tulsa marathon.    It   s a five-mile race.  They said,    We think you could show pretty good     pretty good and  place up there pretty high.       Ah,    I said,    That   s for the big guys. I   m  just a freshman.       Well, we still think you could do pretty good in it.     And they just kept nagging me, the varsity runners did, so I finally gave  in and said,    Okay.    So that morning of the race, I   d never been to  Tulsa, I got on a bus, one that went over to Tulsa, to the athletic club,  went in and changed clothes to a track suit.  The entire five miles was in Tulsa, up and down hills. If you   ve ever  been to Tulsa you know that some parts of town are just hills, hills, hills.  So I decided that, by golly, if I was going to do any good, I was going to  have to stay up pretty close to the front. So when we took off, I jumped  up to the first half a dozen or so guys in the race, and we started out.  And I got about a mile, mile and a half into the race and a motorcycle  cop, who was accompanying us to show us the route, said    Hey kid,  you   re getting quite a way ahead of them. Why don   t you slow down?    I  said, (Laughs) I said,    That   s the way you lose races, you slow down.     So I just kept hammering and stayed out in the lead, got about a mile  from the finish, maybe a mile and half, he said    Hey kid, you   ve got a  big lead on them. Why don   t you slow down?       No. No I   m not going  to.    So I just kept hammering, and I did, I finished a good, oh I don   t  know, three hundred yards ahead of the pack, I guess. And I won the  Tulsa Run, which surprised everybody except our varsity men who had  talked me into running the thing. Now what did you ask me to tell you  about, something I enjoyed?  Yes.  That was the first big thrill I had, was winning that Tulsa Run, because I  had not expected to. In fact I had, I had felt like if I could finish in the  top five or six I would have been doing pretty good, but instead I won  the darn thing. I   m still remembered by some of the guys who were in  that race.    Yeah, I remember you in that Tulsa Run. You were just a  dang freshman. We didn   t think you could do it.    Well, I won it, got a  big trophy about so tall. (Gestures)  From there I went to   Oklahoma A M at that time was in the Missouri  Valley Conference. They didn   t have any freshman cross-country  running in the Missouri Valley, but then the next spring they did have a  13  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  freshman track meet. All the schools in the Missouri Valley Conference  had a   they all did their running on the same day. They ran on their own  track, but they were all that same day. Well, I ran. I ran a half-mile, and  a mile, and the two-mile, and high jump, and I didn   t know how I   d  placed because you ran there at home and the coach wired your time to  the Missouri Valley headquarters, and that was the end of it.  So when I got back to school in the fall, I asked the coach, I said    Hey,  how   d I do in that Missouri Valley freshman cross-country   or track  meet?    He said,    Well, by George, you did pretty good.    He said,    You,  in the Missouri Valley Conference, you were second in the half-mile,  you were second in the mile, and you won the two-mile.    Boy, I felt  pretty big, and I don   t remember how I placed in high jump, probably  didn   t even place, but that was a big thrill. That was the big thrill of my  freshman year, winning the two-mile in the Missouri Valley freshman  meet.  Well     End of the story  (Laughs)  Did you continue to run?  Yes, I ran all through college. I was not exactly a star. I won a few and  lost several, but I did keep running.  Once you started work, did you run?  Yeah.     still continued?  Yeah, yeah.  Were you in any other marathons?  Well, I won that Tulsa Run. I guess that   s the only marathon I ran, but I  ran on the college cross-country team in the Missouri Valley. We won  the Missouri Valley cross-country every year that I ran.  What year did you graduate from OAMC?  That   s a long story. I went on through A M until beginning of my  senior year, junior year, and the Depression hit, and I just didn   t have  any money. My dad didn   t have any money. We went to Mangum, he   d  been a customer at the bank there for twenty-five years I guess. Banker  14  says,    Well Arthur, you   ve been a good customer. You   ve always kept  your interest paid, and when the note came due you always paid the  note, but we are not loaning any money to anybody.    That was the rules  during the Depression. So I thought,    Dadgum, I can   t go to college this  fall.    So I stayed home and picked cotton. I hired out for anything that  would pay money.  I finally decided,    Well, this is not going to get it. I   ve got to get back in  college.    So I called the head of the Field Crops and Soils Department at  A M, and I reminded him that I was going to major in field crops and  soils, could he find any job at all for me? Well, he said,    We   ve got a  little money that we can hire boys with.    He said,    Why don   t you come  up to A M and we   ll talk about it.       Well, I   ll have to hitchhike,  because I haven   t got any money for train fare or bus fare.    Well he said,     You come on up any way you can get here and we   ll talk about it.    So I  went up to A M. That was in probably November. And I met with the  head of the department. He said,    Yeah, we   ve got room for four boys,  and we can pay you twenty dollars a month.    Man that sounded like real  money   So I took the job. About a couple of weeks, the Dean of Agriculture calls  and says,    Fellas, I   ve got bad news for you. Our appropriations have  been cut. We can   t afford what we   re paying you. We   re going to give  you fifteen dollars a month, but that   s all we can afford.    We took it. We  got by on it. Another two or three weeks came by and he called us in  again and says,    Fellas, more bad news. All we   re going to be able to  pay you is twelve dollars a month, and you   re going to work for fifteen  cents an hour.    So we took it. We finally ended up baching, with one of  the guys doing the cooking, but we made it, went on through college.  From there on I worked for the Agronomy Department, they were across  from the Soils Department, for fifteen dollars a month, except when it  was twelve dollars, and I was glad to get it. And that continued until,  until I graduated, only I didn   t graduate like I thought I would.  The department ran out of money again, and we just got by on whatever  they could afford, but it so happened that was when Roosevelt became  president and he started a good government farm program. The county  extension agents were in charge of the program in the county. So, one  day I was working there in the cotton laboratory, fifteen cents an hour,  and the crop judging coach came in and says,    Russell, how would you  like to be an assistant county agent?    I said,    Mr. Statton I don   t have a  degree     He said,    I don   t think it will make any difference. These  county agents are behind the eight ball, and they   ve got to have some  help. The extension service is hiring seniors who are majoring in  agriculture and sending them out as assistant county agents to help the  county agents with this government farm program.    He said,    Would  15  Finchum  Pierson  you like to be one?    I said,    Well, we can talk about it.    He said,    Tell  you what I   ll do. I   ll have Mr. Statton, your crop judging coach, come in  and talk to you about it and see if you can work it.    So he did. A couple  days later Statton came in and talked to me, and we decided,    If you got  a county for me where I can be assistant agent, I   ll take it.     So they sent me down to Hollis, farthest away county agent job there  was. I became assistant county agent there in Harmon County, and I  stayed with it a year and a half. I said to the district agent, he had been  sending assistant county agents over to a new county and being the  county agent I said,    When are you going to have a county for me?     Well, he said,    Russell, we haven   t forgotten you, but the right county  for you has not come along yet. It hasn   t opened up. When it does I   ll let  you know.    Well it was about a month and he called me and says,     Russell, that county   s open now. Do you want to take a shot at it?    I  said,    Yeah, where is it?    He said,    Pauls Valley,    one of the better  counties in Oklahoma, Garvin County. He said,    We were waiting for a  county like this to open up for you.    So they sent me to Garvin County,  to meet the county commissioners.  Well, the county commissioners said to me and to the district agent,     Well, we kind of had our own idea of who we wanted to take that  county agent   s place. We   d like to put the guy who is the assistant there  now in the county agent spot.    The district agent said,    No, that   s not the  way the A M extension does it. We picked the man we presented to  you. If you want him, fine. If not, we   ll send him to somebody else.        Well, we had our mind set on the man that   s assistant agent there now.        No,    the district agent said,    We don   t do it that way for a good reason.  When we do it that way, it gives that assistant agent, while he   s only  being the assistant, sometimes they start cutting the rug out from under  the county agent in order to try to get the job for themselves.    He said,     No, we   ll pick the man. You approve him or don   t approve him.        Well,    they said,    Pierson seems to know what to do. We   ll take him.     So I became county agent there at Garvin County, Pauls Valley, and  stayed eleven years. That was a very good experience, and finally the  people up at A M asked would I like to have a job there on campus in  charge of the Oklahoma Crop Improvement Association, which is the  certified seed organization for the state. I   d have charge of the whole  state. So I looked at it, and we decided. That   s what I did, and pretty  soon they asked me to  also  take over as extension agronomist, which I  did. And things just went up, up, up after that. I have bored you enough.  No  Then what? I understood you did some radio.  (Laughs) Well, yeah, radio and TV. During that time I was  also  in  16  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  charge of seed certification in Oklahoma,  and Oklahoma  A M asked  me would I like to take on a job as head man of the marketing division  of the  Oklahoma  State Board of Agriculture. I took a look at it and did.  I stayed with that for about a year, and Oklahoma A M called me again.  After I   d been marketing director for, I don   t know, a year or two, A M  called me again  Says,    Russell, WKY Radio and Television is looking  for a farm director for their broadcasts.    They said,    We   ve got several  applications, and we   d like to have yours because we think you   re the  man for the job.    So I went up and talked to the powers that be, and sure  enough they hired me, and I did pretty good with it.  From that, things get a little bit fuzzy. Some of the guys at WKY called  and said,    Russell, WKY has asked for us to find a farm broadcaster.  We   ve got several applications for the job but if you want it, we think  you   re the man for it.       Well,    I said,    What does it pay?    Well it paid  quite a bit more than that I had so I said,    I   ll take a look at it.    So I did.  I went and talked to the manager at WKY Radio and Television. I said,     I like what I see, but there   s one hitch. I   ve been told that WKY Radio  and Television is getting ready to close out their farm department.    I  said,    I don   t want to go to a funeral.       Oh,    they said,    It   s not true.     Well, I said,    I want to verify this, that it   s not true, because I don   t want  to go down there and be there for a little while and then be out of a job.     I said,    Do you mind if I go talk to Ed Gaylord?     Now, the Gaylords owned WKY Radio and Television so I asked  Gaylord, well the boy, not Mr. E.K., Ed. Ed and I were acquainted so I  went down and talked to Ed Gaylord. He says,    Russell, I know enough  about you that I know you can handle it.    He said,    I can give you this  assurance. If you want the job, WKY is not ready to close their farm  account, farm broadcasts, and I assure you that job will be there as long  as you do a good job of it, and we think you   ll always do a good job.    So  I took the WKY Radio and Television job, handled it for I don   t  remember how many years, but I enjoyed it.  I was at WKY Radio and  Television from 1959 to 1983.   You were always up for a challenge, sounds like.  Yeah, yeah, it was good.  Had a good reputation?  What?  You had a good reputation?  Oh, I guess I had a fair reputation. (Laughs) I didn   t get any complaints.  17  Bishop  Pierson  Bishop  Pierson  Bishop  Pierson  Were you ever married?  Yeah.  Tell us a little bit about your courtship.  The way you asked that question, I think you know a little about it ahead  of time. (laughter)  Well, you told me how you met your wife earlier.  I guess I was a junior at A M, and working out on the experiment  station in the summer time, fifty dollars a month from sun-up to sun-down.  And four of us boys, you know, we took our noon meal at a  boarding house there in Stillwater that kept girls, board and room, during  the school term. Well, there about the second week of September,  somewhere along in there, us four boys came in that place for lunch,  sweaty and I guess smelly, and there was a whole parlor full of girls,  pretty good looking girls too. Well there was one cute little blonde-headed  girl, blue-eyed. She had on a gingham dress that her mother had  made out of chicken laying mash sacks. Back in those days, these feed  companies sacked up a lot of their feed in printed gingham, sacks made  out of printed gingham.  And this girl had on a little pink and white dress that her mother had  made out of a feed sack, and I thought,    By the way, I   m going to see if  I can   t sit by that little girl when the housemother calls us to lunch.    So I  got over in pretty good position, and sure enough the housemother calls  that lunch is ready. So I asked her,    Come over here and I   ll get you a  chair.    So I got a place where there were two chairs, one for her and one  for me, there at the table. That was our first acquaintance, and she was  everything she looked to be.  FarmHouse Fraternity had been trying to pledge me, but I didn   t have  any money. I couldn   t join, didn   t have any money, and I told them so.  So one day they came to me and said,    Russell, we   re going to have a  hayrack ride. Would you like to bring your date and be our guest at that  hayrack ride?    They said,    It won   t cost you anything. We   ll furnish  some weenies and the marshmallows and everything, the iced tea.        Well,    I said,    Let me see if this little girl I   ve got in mind might like to  go on a hayrack ride. So I caught her out in the hall, it so happened the  cotton laboratory where I worked was in Whitehurst Hall, which was  also a classroom building so I knew what her schedule was. I caught her  out in the hall and said,    Would you like to go on a hayrack ride?       Oh,  I would love it     (Laughs) So I told her when it was, that was our first  18  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Bishop  Pierson  date. We went on a hayrack ride, went out to Boomer Lake there just  north of town, and things went from good to better.  We went together all that semester and the next one. Her daddy had told  her,    You   re going to Oklahoma A M, and I   m having to pay the bill.     He said,    You   re eighteen years old, or seventeen, that   s about when  most girls begin to think about getting married.    He said,    If I   m going  to pay for your college education, two years of it, just so you can get a  teacher   s certificate to teach school, you   ve got to promise me that you  won   t get married for two years.    So she told him,    No. I   m not going to  get married.    So Bernice and I went together all during that semester and  the next semester. Then I went out as assistant county agent, and she got  a school teaching  job  in Noble County there, a one-room school,  fourteen kids. She taught all eight grades, and she taught two years, but  in the meantime I got a job as assistant county agent down in Hollis,  Harmon County. Her school was out on Friday of the second year of her  teaching, and on that next Sunday she was no longer Bernice Strom. I  took care of that. (Laughter) She became Bernice Pierson, and we had  sixty-seven years of very, very happy married life, and then God called  her home, and I   ve been a bachelor ever since.  Sixty-seven years?  Sixty-seven years of married life.  And do you have any secrets to keeping one going that long?  Well, first of all, let God be your guide, and he was. I had a policy.    You  cook it, by George I   ll eat it.    (Laughter) I knew I was safe because she  was an outstanding 4-H Club girl, and she knew all the ins and outs  about homemaking. So she did the cooking for sixty-seven years, and I  sat at the table with her and it was good.  Did you have any children?  Children? Yeah. After we   d been married a year and a half, along came  a little girl whose name we had picked out even before, well, soon after  we were engaged. We were downtown, and men who were lettermen in  athletics got to go to the student senate dances free, except for five cents  which was tax. So one night of a dance, Bernice and I were walking  down the street there in downtown Stillwater and stopped in front of a  jewelry store that had a nice display, and we were looking at the rings,  because we knew we were finally going to need one even though we  couldn   t afford one right then. While we were there, we said we don   t  know when it   ll be, but after we get married, at some point there   s going  to be a third member of our family. If it   s a boy, we were going to name  19  Bishop  Pierson  him after our daddies. Her daddy was Timothy Edgar Strom, and mine  was Charles Arthur Pierson. So we were going to call him Timothy  Arthur, initials T. A. P., see, Timothy Arthur Pierson.  We didn   t buy a ring then because we couldn   t afford one, but we did  finally get married, and a year and a half after we were married, we got,  supposedly Timothy Arthur Pierson started, but just in case it wasn   t a  boy, we picked out a girl   s name, too. I said,    Why don   t we make it a  combination of your name and mine?    Her name was Bernice. My  middle name was Lavere, L-A-V-E-R-E. Russell Lavere Pierson. So we  settled on that, whatever the first kid was. If it was a girl, it   d be a  combination of her name and mine, and if it was a little boy, it   d be  Timothy Arthur, after our daddies. Well, sure enough it was a girl. So  we took the    L A    out of my middle name, Lavere, and put the latter  part of her name to finish it up, Bernice, so the name was LaNese. When  she arrived that   s what we called her, LaNese Joanne Pierson, and God  let us keep that girl for well, again  seventy-five  years, then he took her  home.  A second girl, a second child, also a little girl, six years later, and we  called her Patricia Gayle, and both of them became school teachers. God  called LaNese home about two or three months ago, and Patricia became  a school superintendent, very much in demand. She was superintendent  in Oklahoma, school superintendent in Colorado and then she retired.  Being 101, what   s your secret to living so long, do you think?  Number one, let God be your guide. I haven   t followed him every time,  but that was the main thing. Live close to the Lord, and when you   re  wrong, admit it. And then, I may have already told you this, I had a  policy in marriage, a life policy.    You cook it. I   ll eat it, and no  complaints.    I never one time complained about Bernice   s cooking,  because first of all she was a super cook  She   d been a 4-H Club girl,  and a very successful one.  Well, when she was eight years old, if you can believe this, when she  was eight years old, her mother had to go to Kansas to take care of a sick  relative, and it was threshing time. This was back in the days when the  grain binder came in and cut your wheat, put it in shocks, and the  threshing machine and a crew that hauls bundles to the thresher there on  your farm, made rounds to the farms that needed threshing. Well, this  relative lady, in Wichita, Kansas, got ill during the wheat harvest, and it  so happened that the threshing machine would come to the Strom farm  when Mrs. Strom had to be in Wichita, Kansas taking care of the sick  folks. So Bernice was the oldest child. She was eight years old. She  cooked for the threshing crew, which would be about, oh, anywhere  20  Bishop  Pierson  Bishop  Pierson  Bishop  Pierson  Bishop  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Bishop  from a dozen to fifteen or twenty people, depending how big the crew  was. At eight years old, she cooked for the threshing crew. No one ever  really thought a thing about it, that   s just the way it was.  Today at your age, 101, what would you say     what   s your philosophy  toward life? What   s, what motto do you live by?  Well, as I mentioned maybe briefly a while ago, live close to the Lord.  Try to let the Lord be your guide, and (laughs) eat what   s set before you.  Get plenty of exercise, because that   s no problem out on the farm. That   s  pretty much it.  And what do you do today that gives your life meaning, purpose?  Say that again.  What are some things you do today that give life meaning for you?  Well, I try to, this is repetition. I try to live close to the Lord, follow his  commands. Don   t wear it on your sleeve. In other words, don   t be a  goody-goody. Be reasonable, but live a life so that people know that  Christ is your ambassador and your guide.  Now, when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  (Laughs) I guess I   ll let them do the writing. I want them to let it be  known that I tried to live a good Christian life, and that I loved  agriculture, loved being a part of it, and having, and this sounds like  bragging, but having leadership roles in agriculture, because I did have  them. I was assistant county agent, I was county agriculture agent, I was  head of the marketing division of the Oklahoma State Board of  Agriculture. Well, it could go on and on and on. I had a good  professional life.  At what point did you think you   d be living to be 100?  Well, frankly I didn   t give it much thought. I did what I did and lived. I  tried to be useful. I tried to lead a good Christian life, not by telling  people that I was a goody-goody, but by letting my actions speak louder  than words, and setting an example. That   s about it.  What gets you up in the morning?  Somebody hollering,    Hey, time to get up     (Laughter)  Is there anything you look forward to each new day?  21  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  Oh, I do. I   ve had an interesting professional life, and I look forward to  doing what I need to do.  Anything else you want to add before we close off?  I think you   ve given me plenty of time to brag, (laughter) and I   m trying  not to be boastful, just to put the facts out before you.  Well, was there anything you tried to do that just didn   t work?  Probably, but I don   t remember what it might have been.  You just always rose to the occasion?  What?  Always rose to the occasion?  Yeah, well yeah, something rose. (Laughter)  Well then, I thank you for your time. It   s been a pleasure.  Well, thank you ma   am. You   re very kind.  There is one thing I probably need to mention here. I got two girls, both  of them, each of them successful. My youngest one has had a great  experience as superintendent of schools. She loves kids, she loves being  superintendent. She was kind to the kids and to the school teachers that  she supervised. My oldest daughter, LaNese, was quite an athlete. She   played basketball  in high school  and was  an excellent golf player.  She and another girl won the duo state gold one year. LaNese also, that   s  my oldest daughter, upon my insistence, took part in the Ms. Senior  America Pageant for Oklahoma and, by the way, she won the title of Ms.  Senior America Oklahoma. She competed in the Ms.  Senior  America  Pageant at Atlantic City. I   ve got an alibi for it, but I   m not going to. She  did not win, but she ranked in the top fifteen, which out of fifty-one or  two is not bad.  That   s not bad at all, no.  No. So she was officially Ms. Senior America Oklahoma.  And did you go to Atlantic City with her?  Yes. (Laughs). That shows you how bad my memory is, I had to think  22  Finchum  Pierson  Finchum  Pierson  back, because dog gone, I   ve been on so many trips, but yes. I went to  the Ms.  Senior  America USA with her, and she ranked in the top  fifteen.  Was that in 2010,    11?  Two thousand and ten.  Well, then we   ll wrap it up again, thank you again.  Okay.  -------  -------
