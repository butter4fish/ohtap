 Finchum Today is December 8, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, and this is  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University and today we are  in Edmond, Oklahoma, to visit with Stella Carroll, right? Stella Carroll.  Carroll Yes.  Finchum And this is part of our Oklahoma 100 Year Life, so thank you for  having us.  Carroll You   re welcome.  Finchum Let   s begin by having you tell us when and where you were born.  Carroll I was born in Seward, Oklahoma, Oklahoma County  Logan County   and September 18, 1913.  Finchum So you   re 102?  Carroll Yes ma   am.  Finchum A spring chicken   Carroll (Laughs) Well, when I get old I   ll look back and remember this.  (Laughs)  Finchum There you go. (Laughs) What did your father do for a living?  Carroll He was a boss on the railroad, Santa Fe Railroad. At that time it was  called Santa Fe. I forget what it is now. He had worked there since he  was young. We lived in a company house. He had a large gang of men  working there. Then he heard about Central State, that   s what it was  5  called back then. He thought that would be good for we kids    education.  So he transferred from Santa Fe over to   some people call it a trolley,  but that wasn   t it. Oklahoma Railway, I believe that   s what it was  called. It was a short from Guthrie to El Reno. Course it went down to  Norman from Oklahoma City, a short way. It wasn   t big like the Santa  Fe. We moved to Edmond then, and that   s when I was five years old,  when we moved to Edmond. We lived a year, I believe it was around a  year   we moved from Seward and we moved to Britton. Course he was  still working for Santa Fe when we did that, and that   s when he heard  about Central State. Course he had heard about it before, but it hadn   t  registered with him. (Laughs) And since then I   ve lived in Edmond.  Finchum How many brothers and sisters did you have?  Carroll I had four brothers and two sisters. There were seven of us.  Finchum And where were you?  Carroll I was   let   s see I had three brothers and one sister older than me. Then  a brother and a sister younger than me.  Finchum So almost in the middle.  Carroll Pardon me?  Finchum Almost in the middle, about in the middle.  Carroll Yes ma   am.  Finchum Where did you go to school?  Carroll A lot of people haven   t heard of this, but I started in kindergarten up at  Old North Tower  on the campus of the University of Central  Oklahoma . I went through the sixth grade   no, wait a minute. I started  the sixth grade down in the public school, I believe it was. I can   t  remember whether I went through the sixth grade up there or to the  sixth grade, but a lot of people had never heard the Old North Tower  had a grade school. I   ve had, sometimes when somebody had asked me  where I had started school and I   d tell them they   d say,    Well, that   s a  college.    I don   t know when they changed over or what they have up  there now, but I do know I went there to the first grades in my  schooling. (Laughs) Then Papa bought property on   well, Papa and  Momma, on West Hurd  Street  here in Edmond and we moved just a  block north of here and a block east. Just over the tracks, between the  tracks. That   s when we changed schools.  6  Finchum How many grades did you finish?  Carroll I went through high school.  Finchum Graduated from high school.  Carroll And I started to business school, and got married, then quit. (Laughs)  Since then I haven   t been smart. (Laughter)  Finchum What year did you graduate from high school?  Carroll In 1932.  Finchum And from Edmond?  Carroll Yes ma   am.  Finchum It was just Edmond High School?  Carroll Yes ma   am.  Finchum There   s so many now, I don   t know.  Carroll Well at the old high school up on Boulevard.  Finchum Okay.  Carroll It   s about a block or so north of here on Boulevard.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  Carroll Well, I kind of liked them all. I was just an average student. I wasn   t  smart. They had the average subjects. I had two fav   I can   t think of  their names. I know the principal was one of my teachers and  everybody liked him because he pulled jokes all the time. I had a  teacher in grade school. Yes, wait a minute   Hines, H-I-N-E-S, I  believe it is. She was middle-aged, but she was so nice and kind to  everybody.  Then I can   t think of the principal   s name now, but he was quite a  character. (Laughs) We went on a trip every day, some kind of a   not  every day, but the days we went on the trips why, he was a lot of fun  with everybody. I always enjoyed him. Course after we had been in  school, and him being the principal about two years, we found out he  was a personal friend of my uncle on my father   s side. (Momma didn   t  know where her family was. Her parents passed away when she was  7  young.) Every time I   d make a mistake in school he   d blurt out right in  front of everybody,    I   m going to tell your uncle on you     (Laughs) I  got tired of that and I told him one day, I said,    You go ahead and tell  Uncle Milton. He will laugh at you     (Laughs) But that   s the kind of  teacher he was. He wasn   t   he taught. You had to know the lesson and  you had to bring your written lessons back in.  I think between that school and my father I really learned discipline. My  father was the best father in the world. He lived for Momma and we  kids. That was just it. Anytime we asked what we was going to do this  weekend or so, he would ask us what we   d want to do. If he thought it  was to our good that   s what we did. I said,    I was not a parent like that.     I tried to be, but I just didn   t have the knowledge to follow in how my  father did.  Finchum How would he discipline?  Carroll You didn   t. No meant no. He never whipped us. I never got a whipping  in my life, but some of the rest of them did, but I didn   t. My father  didn   t believe in whipping so much unless you did something he  thought was terrible. My mother, she   d raise her finger,    I   m going to  tell your father on you     So we   d straighten up. (Laughter) My father  was    No    and    You   re grounded for so long or so much,    and it was  good to be that way. I never realized until I had a child that that was the  way you were supposed to do.  Finchum Was he from Oklahoma?  Carroll No ma   am. He was from Kansas. His mother and father lived up in Burr  Oak, B-U-R-R O-A-K, that   s Kansas. That   s up on the Republican  River, our district. The largest place that I have knowledge of being  close is Smith   s Center. We used to go up there practically every year to  see his mother. His father passed away when we were little.  Grandmother had a store and the post office was in the store. It was just  an old fashioned town.  Finchum Neat.  Carroll Yes, and everybody knew. When somebody new came in   I don   t  know how they had to explain it, but everybody knew everything that  everybody else did. It wasn   t a big town.  Finchum Were they farmers?  Carroll No ma   am     8  Finchum She worked in the store     Carroll Yes. My father met my mother   my mother was an orphan and she  had   she wasn   t for sure if the people they put her with, they were  Catholic and Momma was a Catholic. They were named Tillman. They  were farmers, I guess, because Papa was working there one summer  with a crew that moved from one farm to the other, and that   s where  they met. So I   m not for sure.  Momma just didn   t know too much about her family and her life. She  had a brother and when her parents passed away they were separated,  and we never could find out. Course like Momma said whoever adopted  Frank would change his name so we didn   t know who to look for, but  we always would   when we   d find out there was a Frank around about  the age of Momma, I don   t remember if she was the oldest or not, but  she sure wanted to find her brother, but never did. I don   t understand  when they separate them like that why they just cut them off.  Finchum That was probably close to the Depression time too? Or   well, no. that  would   ve been earlier.  Carroll And Papa told her, said,    They probably don   t want him to have  anything to do with the family.    If he didn   t know any more about his  family than Momma did, he was a very lonely man, because Momma,  she didn   t know much. She would always tell us to be sure and always  remember the family. Course we always did what our mother  said .  The three older boys were   my sister was older than me and then there  was a boy older than her. I believe there was seven years between them.  So they were growing up fast when we were just coming along small.  Momma would always tell us,    Love your brothers and sisters.    I did,  well we all did. Some of them weren   t too much on showing it. Now the  boys would fight a lion for we girls, but they   d fight each other.  (Laughs) That would make my dad so mad.  Finchum Did they go into the war? Any of your brothers?  Carroll I had two. My brother, the second boy, went and my younger brother.  My younger brother was a Prisoner of War. He thought he was in  England, but he wasn   t for sure. They wouldn   t tell them where they  were. When he came home   he was a jolly good kid, he   d do anything  for anybody. When he came home he had a fiery temper, and he just  wasn   t   well, he   d kind of shove us back. He   d visit and everything,  and he had lost so much weight that he just looked like his skin was  stretched over bones. Course that was the German and I  forget   Russian prisoner   s what he was.  9  Finchum World War II?  Carroll Yes. My older brother was in the Navy. He wasn   t ever hurt in the war,  he came home doing pretty good.  Finchum Did your husband have to serve?  Carroll No ma   am. We were farmers, and farmers were   they weren   t  necessarily eliminated, but they would not take them if they didn   t need  to, because of growing them food. I know one time he said the   not  restrictions but they had   well I   ll say rules, I can   t think of the word,  that they would kind of keep us under. We couldn   t raise this when we  could raise something else to help the food quantity. I didn   t understand  it but Ernest did, so that was what was necessary. We weren   t big  farmers. We had 160 acres one place and 320 at another. So many right  around   we lived out around Deer Creek, and so many out there had  thousands of acres they   d just pasture cattle on that. We had quite a nice  herd. We sold our milk to Enid, Gold Spot  Dairy .  Finchum So you had dairy cattle.  Carroll Yes ma   am. Most of them were the black and white ones.  Finchum Jerseys?  Carroll No.  Finchum No?  Carroll Guernsey was kind of like Jerseys   Holsteins. Takes me a while to get  my memory to working.  Finchum You   re doing good. How many did you have?  Carroll Milking, we had about thirty, daily. But we had quite a few with calves  with them. Some not milking yet, or they were, and course Ernest was  always going to the sale and buying the young group. I   m not for sure  just how many we had just at any one certain time, but he   d try to buy  five or six at one time.  Finchum Did you have to help milk?  Carroll Well I tried. We didn   t have any milkers at that time, and that is these  electric milkers. I was so slow and Ernest had to finish up for me, so he  never did ask me again if I wanted to go milk. (Laughter) I said,    I  found out how to keep from going.    (Laughs) I didn   t mind it but I went  10  out there and I said,    Now where do you want me to start at?    He told  me the cow. I got the stool and sat there. I knew what I was supposed to  do. I was trying to milk faster, but my hands just wasn   t doing it. He  said,    You want to be careful with that cow because she   ll step in the  bucket of milk when you   re through.    Well, I was watching her pretty  close and she tried to kick me. I said,    Do you know this cow kicked?        Oh yeah, she   s kind of bad about that.    (Laughs) I said,    Why   d you  give her to me?       Because I knew that you weren   t harsh on pulling on  her milk or anything. I didn   t think she   d do that.    We had two or three  that was bad about that. Some were worse than that one, but she was the  prettiest little thing. (Laughs) I said,    I   m not going to milk her  anymore     (Laughter) You can have fun when you   re working.  (Laughs) The other guy gets the fun.  Finchum We should back up, when did you get married?  Carroll In 1939.  Finchum So after the Depression?  Carroll Yes ma   am. You learn to make a dollar be two dollars. But on the farm  you   ve got all your milk, butter, eggs, if you had chickens, and we had a  whole bunch of chickens, and your meat. So you   re not going hungry.  That is a big item out of your grocery bill. We did   we butchered   we  had hogs too. Oh I hated those smelly things. We butchered one pig and  a cow at least once a year and sometimes twice a year. So we were  never out of meat or anything. I made my own butter, I made my own  cottage cheese, so you learn how to do things like that. The deal of it, it  wasn   t too bad doing it. Then when we got electric milkers, why, Ernest  added a few cows. We always had good cream and then milk.  Finchum Make homemade ice cream?  Carroll Well not often. If we went to town that   s one thing we did, if anybody  wanted ice cream. Course we only had one son. He always wanted an  ice cream cone. He never wanted a dish, it was an ice cream cone. We   d  always just buy his and if we wanted   we always had enough money  for what we wanted like that. You never thought about being poor, and  we weren   t poor, but we weren   t rich either. We had a good, happy life,  that   s one thing. My husband never raised his voice and he never  scolded. He   d just say something in kind of a quick voice and you knew  he wasn   t happy about it. (Laughs) He and I had a good, happy life.  Course he was crazy about the boy.  Billy was   we have two Billy   s in the family and you think that isn   t a  mix-up. (Laughter) When we first moved to town we lived in the house  11  on the corner. My husband   s brother and his wife built that house. I   d  say something about Billy and they   d say,    Which one?    Course Billy   Junior  was named after his father. Then people got   they both were  growing up and Billy Junior, that   s the one you met, was going to  school here. He would get telephone calls. Well, so did the father. I had  to go through the system,    Which one are you calling for?    Then tell  them where that one was. Three-fourths of the men would say,    Well  where   s Billy?    I said I would never name a kid Junior. (Laughs) It runs  into confusion a lot. I started out at about half the time I   d direct some  to where Billy Junior was, instead of the father.  Finchum When did you move from the farm to town?  Carroll In 1970.  Finchum A long, long time ago.  Carroll The only reason we did, the family we were renting from, their son  wanted it. We didn   t have one in view, so we started looking around.  Ernest decided we   d just try to buy one. He got the bank loan and got a  loan for us. We thought it wouldn   t be bad trying to find   then every  farm we   d go see   and I got so tired of going. I knew the farmers were  getting tired of us too. They would, the government,    No. That farm is  too much.    Yet they   re the one giving the loan. We went out as far as  Crescent and we went east quite a ways. We saw some beautiful places  and most of them cost less than what they did right here. I could never  understand that.  Then Ernest got sick. He had emphysema. When he went to the hospital  he went into a coma right then. I just stayed there and paid rent, but my  brother-in-law and sister-in-law didn   t want us to pay anything. I said,     Yeah.    I got a job out at Frontier City  Amusement Park  in the Indian  Trading Post. I liked it because I was out among the people and all. I  managed to keep my bills paid and pay my rent and all. I thought,    Well  I was doing pretty good.    Then Ernest never came out of the coma. He  just passed away, so I didn   t have anyone to help advise me. I felt lost,  but I learned.  I told Bob and Mary Lou, I said   they talked about selling. I said,    I  want to buy this house.    Bob didn   t want to sell it. It was a good mark  off for them. He was working for an oil company and Mary Lou was a  teacher, so they were making fairly good money. They just had one boy  too, they thought that that was their tax write-off. Then when Bob  passed away, Mary Lou   I had already remarried.  12  Mr. Carroll and I were good friends because he and his wife built this  place. The son built it. He had a company, a building company. We  were neighbors and he came over one night and said,    Why don   t you  move in with me and you won   t have to pay rent.    I said,    Oh no I   m  not.    He looked at me   and I was like,    No.    He said,    Well, we can  get married.    We were not married, we were good friends. We did go  through the ceremony, but I wasn   t marrying any man. I told him, I  said,    My husband is the only one I ever loved. I like you as a friend.     He said,    Well that   s the way I am about you.    He would talk about his  wife, and I   d talk about Ernest. The neighbors, for a long time, thought  we were crazy. (Laughs)  Bishop How old were you the second time around?  Carroll Let   s see, Ernest passed away in 1971. I was a widow a little over  five   well, five years. We got married in 1976, so I can   t figure out  what year, just off the hat.  Finchum What was Ernest   s last name?  Carroll Hanson.  Finchum H-A-N-S-E-N?  Carroll H-A-N-S-O-N.  Finchum Hanson.  Carroll There were Hansens. We were Hansons. A lot of people couldn   t think  about that. When I   d say Hanson, they   d say,    You mean Hansen?        No, I mean Hanson.     Finchum S-O-N.  Carroll Yes. His folks were farmers and of course he grew up that way and  that   s why he wanted to be a farmer.  Finchum Well, living back on the farm with your brothers and sisters, did you  have to share a room? A bedroom with your brothers and sisters?  Carroll I did   well, see my     Finchum They were older.  Carroll    we lived in Edmond. We didn   t live on the farm then. When we lived  on the farm it was Ernest and I and then Billy, my son. We always had a  13  big house, two-story house. I hated that because going up the stairs,  trying to keep the upstairs clean and all that wasn   t any fun.  Finchum Did it have electricity?  Carroll Yes ma   am. We didn   t have it when we were first married, but the place  we lived in, a widowed woman owned it. She thought my husband was  part angel. She asked him one day if she put electricity in if we would  pay a little more on the rent. Ernest said,    Well yes, because I   d like to  have a milker.    He   d like to have different things, you know, that would  help him. She said,    Do you know a good electrician?    Ernest said,     Yes, me.    We were first married, he had worked under an electrician  and his boss told me in front of a group, they owned the hardware store  here, that Ernest was one of the best electricians they   d ever had. He  was just an apprentice. He was still working there when we got married  and we lived out east of Edmond. He worked here in Edmond.  He asked me one day, he said,    Would you be happy on the farm?    I  said,    Well, I   ve never lived on a farm, but my friends had been  farmers.    I had one of the greatest friends that lived in Seward, they  were farmers. He said,    I think I   m going back to the farm to help with  the herd.    He had a small herd at his folk   s farm. I said,    Do you think  just a farm, small herd, would keep us going? I can keep my work, but I  think driving       If you have to drive too far I know it won   t, because of  the expense. He said,    Yes, but I want you to quit working because on  the farm you have plenty of work.    So I quit work and we moved to the  farm. Everything just worked out beautifully. I think it was because we  set our mind to it.  If he hadn   t known enough about it, I knew a little bit about farming  because every summer I   d go up to Seward and stay a while with those  people. Then the daughter would come down and spend it here in town,  but I never thought much about the work. We always called that woman  and man aunt and uncle. They weren   t any kin, but my dad would not  let us call them by first name. He didn   t like the name of Mrs. and Mr.  when they were such close friends. Aunt Anna said one day,    Just call  me Aunt Anna.    Man   s name was Cleave.    You can call him Uncle  Cleave.    Papa said,    That   s fine. If you want your children to call us  aunt and uncle,    and that   s the way it was. They were friends. Let   s see,  I was four months old, Momma said, when they met Uncle Cleave and  Aunt Anna. They were friends the rest of their life. They   d come to our  house just like you   d go to your aunt and uncle   s. You   d help, you   d do  whatever was necessary. It was a good family deal.  Finchum You adopted each other.  14  Carroll I guess we did, because I tell you when we lost them, it was worse than  losing my own aunt and uncle. But my own aunt was the type  that   well, we went to visit her one Sunday and whenever we   d go visit  Aunt Anna and Uncle Cleave we dropped in. We dropped in on Aunt  Bessie and Uncle Milton. She very plainly, in front of the whole group  said,    Will, I want you to always call me and ask if you can come.    We  never went back. My father   and that was   Papa had two sisters. That  was   he was a little boy. It was just kind of a bolt of lightning when  she said it. And you know brothers and sisters, they drop in on each  other. We always did and we never thought much about it, but that was  the way Papa   s family was. When he went to visit his mother he had to  write and tell her that he was coming and then wait on her response.  Momma and Papa, we had people dropping in all the time.  Papa would always celebrate the Fourth of July. They used to have big  doings at Stephenson Park. That   s the one on Fifth, isn   t it? The whole  town and country would practically be there. Papa would go to the ice  house, which was right over here on First Street. If he knew how many  was coming, he   d get a five-gallon of ice cream. If he wasn   t for sure,  he   d get ten gallons. Those great big   it was a wooden   looked like a  wooden bottom of an ice cream freezer. They   d pack it well for him and  everything. Momma and we girls would spend days cooking, baking  and all. We   d all go down to the park after lunch, then come back and  eat supper, and then people would go home. It was wonderful. (Laughs)  I don   t know, none of Papa   s family ever came, but we   d have different  families from around here. We had a family out at Deer Creek that the  girl and I were friends. I met her the day she first started high school  there when she was   I believe we were juniors. We were in the same  grade. Her name was Clara and her family would just   they didn   t ask  if they could come. They   d just drop in, and that   s the way my folks  were. We   ve had people drop in at a meal that we weren   t expecting  anyone, but Momma always had plenty for the extra ones. I never could  get ready for anyone when they   d say they were inviting. Course the  folks invited anyone. They were welcome. That   s the way people lived  back then, it wasn   t   I don   t know how they do now. Of course I have  people and family that drops in. I don   t pay any attention to them. If I   m  not cooking, and I don   t cook anymore, they have to fix their meal.  (Laughs)  Bishop How important was church back in your growing up?  Carroll Church? The First Christian Church here in Edmond.  Bishop Did you attend church? Did your family go to church on a regular  basis? How important was it?  15  Carroll I was nine years when I joined. My father never did join the Christian  Church. He was raised a Methodist, but he went to the Christian  Church. Momma was Catholic, but she   s changed over to being a  Protestant because Papa wanted her to. Papa never had anything against  the Catholic, but back then there were some terrible stories about them.  So Papa just told her, he thought for the children too   he   d like for her  to join. Momma still was partially, in her mind and heart, a Catholic  when she died. We never thought much about it, and we didn   t think it  was awful for her to feel that way. Some people did and some of the  women made some sarcastic things about it until she joined the church.  She joined before any of we kids did. My sister and I, older sister and I,  joined the same time.  Bishop Do you still attend church today?  Carroll I would like to. I have a friend that she used to take me to church, but I  don   t feel like I should get in the crowd with my walker. I   m afraid that  if I got in a crowd I might fall or something, so I read my bible and this  book. It   s a reference book. My nephew gave me that when I was a  hundred years old. I read that and I read the bible. I pray. I won   t pray  in public, because I don   t think I know how well enough. My belief is  to live right and love the fellow man. I think that I   m doing the best I  can now.  Bishop You said you liked to read, do you read anything else? Do you read any  other type of material?  Carroll Oh yes. I read   that   s inspiration.  Gestures to A Ranger for the  Holiday by Allie Pleiter   Bishop A romance.  Carroll The bible verses are worked in that. I   ve read those books, I don   t know  how many, since I got out of the hospital back in 2011. My neighbor  over here has them and she called me one day after I got out of the  hospital and she wanted to know if I read. I said,    Yes I do.    I read a lot  like that in the hospital. I told her yes, and she said,    Can you go and  buy them?    I said,    Billy will take me.    She said,    Don   t do that, Stella.  I   ve got worlds of books here.    And she must have. Every time Billy  goes and takes the books back, she sends about two or three dozen at  one time. I read those. It takes me about three weeks to read that.  Finchum That   s pretty good.  16  Carroll When I was reading in the hospital, I didn   t have any roommate until at  the last. I was reading one day and some people came in and talked to  my roommate. The man said,    Stella, how many have you read today?     (Laughs) I said,    Well, I haven   t finished this.    He says,    We talk about  you reading.    But what else would you do? I said,    I can   t do anything  here at the hospital so I just read.    Even here at home, if I sit down I  pick up my book. I don   t like to just sit, and I don   t like TV. The only  thing I watch is the Wheel of Fortune and The Price is Right and the  news and weather. Someone said,    Don   t you watch the afternoon        Finchum Soap operas?  Carroll Yes. I said,    No, I got,      oh boy. I had two neighbors on the farm that  watched them and if they went to town, they   d stop and ask me to watch  them for them. Finally I told them, I said,    Why don   t you get a        Finchum A VCR recorder?  Carroll Yes, and I said,    I   ve got one and you can borrow it.    They said they  had one but they didn   t want to miss any of the program. I   d watch it  and every day, for three or four days, it   d be the same thing. (Laughs) I  told them one day I said,    How can you feel like you   re seeing that  when you   re looking at the same thing?    I just couldn   t imagine anyone  enjoying something like that, but they did. So that was fine, but I didn   t  enjoy it. (Laughter)  Finchum Did you sew?  Carroll Yes, I embroidered and sewed, patched. (Laughs) I don   t try it now. I  have a machine, it   s quite old, but it   s still   it   s a Singer. It still works  good, but I asked Billy to open it up and we   d just leave it open and he  won   t do it. He says,    Grandma, you might run a needle in your finger.     I   ve done that. I told him, I said,    I   ve done that, hon. All I do is take it  out and put some medicine on it,    peroxide most generally. He said,     No, let   s don   t do that. You don   t know just exactly what it could do to  you. Blood poisoning could set in or something.    I said,    I don   t think  so.    But he wouldn   t do it.  Finchum Did you ever think you would make it to one hundred?  Carroll No ma   am. Most of my family passed away in their eighties. I firmly  thought I would too. When I kept getting another birthday it was kind of  a surprise, but it isn   t anymore. When I was a hundred my daughter-in-law,  and my granddaughter had me a party. Lois has a beautiful home  down at Yukon. That house is half again bigger than this and it seemed  17  like to me it was people in every room. I didn   t even get to talk to half  of them, there were so many. I enjoyed the party and everything.  Along comes my hundred and one birthday, and Brenda asked me when  I wanted my party. I said,    We had a party last year, let   s not have one.     Same with hundred and two. They thought that was awful, but I don   t  see to have a party every year. It was all on Lois to straighten up and get  things ready for the party and then to straighten up. At that time her  husband was in bad health and since then he has passed away. I  couldn   t see, for Lois, and even if Brenda stayed and helped her, that   d  still be a lot of work for two people. They said they wanted me to have  a party and I said,    Well, let   s wait a few years.    So, I don   t know when  it   s coming. (Laughter)  Finchum Hundred and five   Carroll I   d rather, if I lived that long, I   d rather wait about five years and they  could have the party then. It   s   I don   t know. So many people, I didn   t  know we had that many friends still living.  Bishop What do you contribute your longevity to? What   s your secret to  longevity?  Carroll You know, I don   t know. The only thing I know, I never drank   wait a  minute. I tried it once and I tried smoking once and didn   t like either  one, but I never drank or smoked. I don   t even know that that would  hurt you, because I   m sure there are others lived longer and they had  drank and smoked. I don   t know, I had nothing against it if that   s what  they want to do.  Finchum Do you eat pretty much what you want?  Carroll Yes. I drink a lot of pop, and tea and coffee. I   m a coffee drinker.  (Laughs) I keep my water there. I really don   t know why me and why  not some of my other family. Most all my family and friends are gone. I  lost three friends around last Christmas and two sisters-in-law. If I  knew, I   d probably live a little different. (Laughter) But I feel like  maybe it   s because I worked out, I worked here, I kept active. Maybe  that   s it, I don   t know. The good Lord knows and that   s the only one  that I can tell you that does. (Laughter)  Finchum What time do you usually get up in the mornings?  Carroll All the way from four o   clock to six thirty. (Laughs) That   s right. I may  be getting up about four o   clock some days. I don   t know why, I just  wake up, so I get up.  18  Finchum What do you do that early?  Carroll I eat my breakfast, and read my bible. Then I start my housework.  Course I watch The Price is Right from ten to eleven, so that takes up  an hour of a morning. It takes me most all day to do whatever I want to  around my house because I   m terribly slow now. I don   t have any time  schedule anymore.  Finchum Do you take a nap?  Carroll If I sit down, and I never usually do this, I might fall asleep for a few  minutes or thirty minutes. Then I   m ready to go again. (Laughs)  Finchum And what time would you go to bed at night?  Carroll Oh, all the way from ten thirty until one o   clock. Just when I get sleepy.  I believe that   s because   I   ve heard this, that elderly people don   t need  as much sleep as they used to. I   m judging by my schedule, but I used  to go to bed about ten thirty and get up about six thirty.  Finchum Got your eight hours of sleep.  Carroll Yes, and I sleep good. You   d think with me going to bed like that that I  would wake up or maybe be tired or something, but I   m not.  Bishop Do you have anything on your bucket list that you want to do?  Something you   d like to do and never done before?  Carroll No. I   m a homebody. (Laughter) I can   t think of anything unless it  would be something around here. I just don   t know.  Finchum When did you give up driving?  Carroll When I was ninety-three years old. I remember that. This lady next door  didn   t drive, and for years she had gone with me to the grocery store. So  she needed to go that day and I said,    Well, I   ll take you.    I was still  working   no, I had quit working when I was eighty-six, I think it was.  Somewhere along there. I told her, I said,    Well, we   ll go just as soon  as I get cleaned up.    I won   t go anywhere if I   m not clean.  So we went up to Dollar General, that   s where she wanted to go, and  Walmart. We came out of that shopping center up here coming out  south and I got just about in the middle of that road. It   s a double one  going through there. Jane said,    Oh Stella,    and I looked up. I had  looked up and sat there on the north side for a while and looked both  19  ways to be sure there wasn   t any traffic. So I looked up and there was  a   I don   t know whether it was a woman, man, child, what, just  barreling at me from the east. I said,    Well, hold tight Jane,    and I  backed in real quick. I looked in my mirror and saw there wasn   t  anyone parked there. If I had been a minute or two later that car  would   ve just plowed right into us. I sat there a minute or two and then  it was clear so I started up. I said,    Jane, I believe this is the last time  I   m going to drive.    She said,    Well, if that   s what you want to do.    I  said,    Yes, I don   t want to go through something like that again.    I  knew my reflexes were not what they should be.  I called Billy and I asked him if he would take Jane and I grocery  shopping when we needed to go or if he   d buy my groceries, whatever.  He said,    Grandma, whatever you want, I   ll do.    So Jane said she   d just  have Doris, that   s her sister that   s across the street on the corner there,  have Doris to pick up her things because Doris works at CVS. She was  around the grocery stores, different ones and she could pick things up  out of the store she worked at, anyway. So that   s the way we worked it.  Sometimes they   d pick mine up, and sometimes we   d pick hers up.  Then I fell. That stopped me from going.  Finchum That   s why you were in the hospital? Because you fell?  Carroll I broke my hip and they   it was a long siege. They put a pin in first and  it started slipping. Everybody   s practically does. So they went back in  in the same scar and put the whole new hip in. When the first operation  was over I was walking as good as I always did. Then that started and  this is the way it left me. I told my   I didn   t tell   Billy told the doctor  one of my legs was longer than the other. I was walking   you see the  elderly people, I believe that   s what   s wrong. The doctor told Billy,     We   ll check it. We   ll take care of it.    I don   t walk that way, but one of  my legs is just a little bit shorter, my right one. My feet are not the same  size, so I told the doctor and he says,    Do you want another operation?     I said,    Good Heaven   s no     That   s what it would be, so I told him I  said,    I   ll put up with it unless it gets worse.     I went through rehab up there, and I couldn   t get my strength back.  That   s my problem now. I asked the doctor, I said,    Doctor, when they  know they   ve got to put a complete hip in, why don   t they do that at  first and don   t put that silly pin in?    They showed me an x-ray where it  showed that slipping and how and all. He said,    That   s the way it   s  supposed to be.    I said,    No, it   s not. You   re going on what the doctors  say.    I said,    Three-fourths of the people that I   ve talked to have had  the same problem I   ve had.    That   s the reason you find so many elderly  people that can   t do much, and it   s not fair to them. I said,    What you  need to do, put that in, it won   t be any harder on them right from the  20  first than it is the second.    He said,    We know that.    If they know it, it   s  not fair to the people   Finchum You tell them.  Carroll I told the doctor, I said,    If you want me to I   ll tell the other doctors  that     (Laughter)  Bishop Need a little more lighting.  Carroll Yeah, I   ve got a bright light in here.  Finchum It helps. It   s better.  Carroll I   m not a doctor, I   m not a nurse, but I have sense enough to know what  I need. (Laughs) But I have a specialist that I go to for my hip, but I go  to a medical doctor here in Edmond. Both doctors, the doctor and his  assistant, are just wonderful. The assistant hugs all the women. I told  Dr. Ponder, I said,    You don   t get to hug the women. He   s quicker than  you are.    (Laughter)  Bishop What advice would you give someone who wants to live a hundred  years?  Carroll I don   t give advice. (Laughter) You know if a person asked me, I don   t  know. I just know that the good Lord has made me live this long, and he  might make them, but I don   t know how to tell anyone. I never thought  I would. I didn   t have any wishes for it. I   m glad I did so I   m with my  family, but if I tell somebody how to live, that   s wrong. Everybody  knows what they should or shouldn   t do. I believe that that is a good  thing for them.  Bishop If history were written today, what would you want it to say about you?  How would you want to be remembered?  Carroll I   m scared they   d say,    That   s that old woman.    (Laughter) Really, I  don   t know. I hope they   d say I had a good life and that I was a good  friend, but that   s about all I know. I never thought, it used to bother me  if a person talked about me, but after I got older I don   t think about  people talking about me. I don   t believe that too many pay much  attention to me. Course I don   t go to   I used to belong to lodges and  clubs. I found out there   s a lot of gossip in both, and I don   t believe in  that. It   s fine if a person wants to, if they can live with themselves, but  it bothers me to talk against anyone.  21  I   ve gotten to where   I used to vote, never missed, but I don   t anymore,  and I   ve been asked,    Who you going to vote for?    I tell them,    All of  them.    That   s all I know. If I was asked, really, right now, I   d have to  say,    I don   t know who is running.    I know some of them. I mean I  know of some of them, but I don   t know who I   d vote for. I just hope  the best person wins.  Finchum Do you remember voting for the first time?  Carroll Yes, and I thought it was the greatest thing when I changed eighteen  that I could vote. (Laughs) Yes, I don   t remember   oh yes  I  remember. Roosevelt. I voted for him and I always felt like he was a  good candidate. I don   t know whether he really was. I didn   t know  much about the candidates ahead of him. I don   t know how they did, or  anything. My father was a good person of voting. Course Momma  followed what my father did. I don   t know whether I voted right or  wrong. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you vote the way your father did?  Carroll Not always. I joined the Democrats because Papa and Momma were,  but sometimes I would crossover. Now, I wouldn   t follow anyone.  (Laughs)  Finchum Did you vote for Henry Bellmon?  Carroll Yes, I did.  Finchum Republican.  Carroll Yes, I thought he was a good person. I can   t remember all the ones I  voted for, but in the last ten years I   d say, I haven   t paid much attention  to them. I know there are good people out there, but there   s also some  that   s not so good. But I   d like to see somebody good get in and  straighten a few things up. (Laughs)  Finchum Maybe you should run.  Carroll (Laughs) Boy, would I straighten them up  (Laughter) You know  everybody has their own opinion. Sometimes it   s good and sometimes  it   s not. I just don   t know how I would vote. I saw you looking at my  pictures. My sister-in-law painted that, and the one with the little  fisherman, one of my friends. They   re both hand painted. That   s painted  by a left-handed man.  Finchum It   s very nice.  22  Carroll He worked out there at Frontier City   well, the store. That   s the way I  should word it. I went to work one day and my boss-lady said,     Stella       Well, anyway. I can   t remember his name. His wife worked  with us. Anyway, he told me that he wanted me to come over to the  store. I said,    Well, I   ll go there after work.    I thought,    What does he  need?    I couldn   t figure it out, because his wife was over there working  with us. His wife   s name was Meryl. Meryl said,    Oh Stella, just go  find out.    I said,    I   ll go pretty soon.    She said,    No. Go now.     He had that on an easel and it wasn   t quite finished. He showed it to me,     Do you like it?    I said,    Yes. I   m not very smart with artwork like  that.    He said,    That   s yours. I   ll let you know when I finish it.    I was  the only one that he did that for. It made me kind of proud and yet I  thought there were others that would like to have one of his pictures. In  fact, I wish mine would   ve been more outdoors where it was flowers  and trees, but I wouldn   t have told that man that for nothing. He had  done all that work and he stretched it, put it in a frame, so I   m happy  with it.  Finchum You were special.  Carroll I guess. I just couldn   t figure out what I   d done. The only thing I know,  when we came to work we came past a store. His store first. I would  knock on the door or window and holler at him,    Have a good day     Or  whatever, you know. That   s the only thing I ever did. I didn   t stop and  talk with him, only in the evening going home. I didn   t know what  brought it on. That might   ve done it, I   m not for sure. I did that for two  or three others. We were really the only older ones there. There was a  candy store there and two bachelors. I   d knock on their window,    I   m  trying to break in.    That   s what I   d always tell them. They   d always  have something to say back to me, but they were really nice too.  I said we had such a good group out there. It was kind of like a family  that   s always lived together and you pull jokes on them and everything.  That store that I worked at was wonderful. The bosses   I never saw my  boss nor heard him raise his voice. If he was going to scold somebody,  he called them back to the office and talked to them. Then if it didn   t  stop, he   d just let them go. I said that was the kind of boss I like.  Finchum Similar to your father. A lot like your father.  Carroll Oh yes. My father, boy, it didn   t take him long to straighten you out.  You knew when he said no, there was no way you could change his  mind. Now Momma, you could wrap her around your finger. (Laughter)  She was very easy. But I don   t know, I never thought much about it. I  23  knew that you should mind your father and mother, they knew best, and  that   s the way we grew up.  Finchum They did a very good job with you.  Carroll Thank you. Neither one of them yelled at us, you know. We had a  neighbor, you could hear them. Course we lived over there on Hurd.  The neighbor on the west was   they had a daughter that was adopted  and she would yell at that girl. He wouldn   t really yell, but he raised his  voice. It was hard to take. But Papa would just   if he came in the  kitchen and he had something he didn   t like that you   d done or said,  he   d stop you right in your tracks and tell you about it. (Laughs) And  really, it was best. When people would hit their kids and all I think it  made it harder on the person, but Papa didn   t have to, except the boys a  few times to straighten them out.  Finchum It think we   ll close off right now.  Carroll Surely.  Finchum Thank you.  -------  -------
