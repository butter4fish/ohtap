 Finchum Today is July 21, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We are with Oklahoma State University. Today we are in  Yukon, Oklahoma, to speak with Loraine Harris. This is part of our  Oklahoma One Hundred Year Life project. Thank you for having us  today. Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were  born.  Harris I was born in Sweetwater, Oklahoma in 1914, April 17, 1914.  Finchum And did you have brothers and sisters?  Harris I have one sister and three brothers living. And a brother and sister  deceased when they were infants.  Finchum And where are you in the order?  Harris I   m next to the last one.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Harris My dad was a farmer. Mother was a housewife. She did everything  there was to do on the farm, as I have. I have always said,    I   ve done  everything there is to do on a farm.    Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Finchum Describe the house you grew up in?  Harris Up until very recently it was still standing out three miles north of  Sweetwater. It   s a four-room house. I don   t know how in the world we  all lived in it, but we did. We had orchards and vineyards. We raised a  lot of vegetables and all of our fruits and that sort of stuff. Had a herd of  dairy cattle.  5  Finchum Did you have to help milk?  Harris Oh I was milking before I was old enough to go to school.  Finchum Really? What other chores did you have?  Harris Oh, I did everything there was to do, feed the pigs or whatever there  was to be fed. Shucked corn and shelled it. My younger brother and I  did that every afternoon after school. We just shucked corn and they put  the corn through the grinders, to where they would take the corn off the  cob and shell it. A corn sheller is what they were called. We did that  after school. We were there until I was in fourth grade, I guess, and my  dad   s health gave away. He thought if we could get back to Arkansas,  he would recuperate. That didn   t happen. My mom couldn   t live in the  lower lands of Arkansas, so we came back to Oklahoma and built a new  home in Tillman County. I finished junior high and high school in a  little town north of Frederick called Manitou. Went to   I had a brother-in-  law that was determined I was going to go to college and the boys  could look at for themselves but I was going to college. He financed my  college. I in turn repaid him when I started to work.  Finchum Where did you go?  Harris I went to Southwestern and got my degree, first degree from  Southwestern. I have hours in OU and OSU both. I   ve gone to school  all my life. I kidded and said that I have enough hours for a doctorate  with all those things that they wanted to take while you were teaching.  Everything that came out new, we had to take a course in it. So I   ve  gone to school all my life.  Finchum What grades did you teach?  Harris I taught first grade. I had high school majors in economics, sociology,  history and government, never did teach either one of them. Well, I  taught economics one semester. Our principal died and I was the only  one in the building that was qualified to teach economics to a sixth  grade class. I did that one semester and thoroughly enjoyed it. That   s  the only time that I ever taught my high school majors. I went back and  got my elementary certificate the second summer after I graduated. I  finished   I went thirty-three months straight. Missed one day. I got sick  on rhubarb pie from the tin pan that it was cooked in. That   s the one day  that I missed in thirty-three months going to college and worked every  day.  Finchum Have you had rhubarb since?  6  Harris Oh yeah. I have it in my freezer right now. (Laughs) I could make you a  rhubarb pie very easily.  Finchum Back in high school, what year did you graduate?  Harris Thirty-three.  Finchum Thirty-three. Did you have a favorite subject?  Harris Oh, I always loved history. I like to read history. I   ve always enjoyed  history.  Finchum Did you play any sports or     Harris I played basketball until I got   well I played as recreation in college. I  was too small to play on the teams. I played basketball through high  school and as a recreation in college.  Finchum What position?  Harris Forward most of the time.  Finchum That was when it was     Harris When we had the divided courts.  Finchum Yeah, by three or whatever.  Harris Three.  Bishop Was it a dirt court?  Harris Well, I played on a dirt court. After I got into high school, we had an  inside gym, but in the grade school, I played on the dirt court.  Bishop The uniform, what was the uniform?  Harris Yeah, we had uniforms. In fact they were pretty nice. They were white  trimmed in purple. I remember that. (Laughter) Yeah, I enjoyed that.  My dad died when I was a sophomore in high school. Mom stayed on  the farm with us until I finished high school. I guess he finished, too. He  finished the year after I did. Then, she sold the farm and moved to  Sayre, Oklahoma, where my sister lived. She lived there. She lived  independently, as I always have. That   s why I   m out here. I refuse to  7  live with either one of my sons. I don   t want to burden them with me, or  I didn   t want to burden myself with them.  Finchum Well, when you finished college, where was your first job?  Harris In Sweetwater. I went back and taught three years out there. Enjoyed it  thoroughly and then I went with my roommate to Garber, Oklahoma.  She was going up there to interview for a teaching position. I went with  her. I interviewed   while she was visiting with the high school  principal, she was a business teacher, I visited with the superintendent.  When she got through with her interview and I got through with mine  he hired us before we left at Garber. I taught there two years. I married  while I was there. We bought our first home in Enid, Oklahoma. I  taught in a small school on the edge of town. It was kind of a religious  school. Only one-room school I ever taught in.  Bishop What was the name of the school?  Harris Reynolds I believe, if I remember correctly. We had about twelve to  fifteen students most of the time. It was kind of a neighborhood affair.  We did everything that everybody else did. We had a Christmas  program for the community. With fifteen kids that   s a pretty good  chore.  Finchum When you got married, did you have to quit work?  Harris Oh no.  Finchum Was it     Harris I didn   t even slow up.  Finchum No, but sometimes we   ve heard that you couldn   t teach if you were  married.  Harris Well, no. Let   s see. We kept our marriage a secret for   we married in  April, and then we announced the marriage after Thanksgiving I think.  But I went ahead and taught the second grade in Garber a second year  after I was married.  Finchum How did you meet him?  Harris I met him when I was in college. We kind of kept in contact off and on  through the years. Then, when I went back to Garber, he was liquidating  banks. He worked for the state department. He was liquidating banks  and we met again. He was around there. He worked for the state in Enid  8  I believe. That   s what he was doing in Enid, he worked for the state. He  continued to work for the state there and I taught in this small school  two years I guess it was. Then, we went to Wichita and went to work in  the ammunition plants. He worked for Boeing and I worked for the  parts department. I did final inspection on trainer planes when we were  in Wichita. He was drafted in Wichita. He went from Wichita into the  Army, and I stayed on there and did final inspection for that department  for a couple of years until he could live off the Army camp. He was on  the cadre. He was an accountant. They made a cook out of him. He  cooked in the officers    mess for four years in Camp Wolters, Texas,  near  Mineral Springs , I guess it was.  Finchum You went to Wichita before the war?  Harris Wichita, Kansas.  Finchum Before the war?  Harris Yes. Worked in the plants. As I said, he worked for Boeing and I went  on the line, originally. I was only on the line oh less than a year I think,  and they moved me up to inspection. I asked why I was taken off of the  line and trained in final inspection. They said,    Because you have a  college degree.     Finchum You were a Rosie the Riveter for a little while.  Harris Yeah I was. Not too long, because they took me off the line and trained  me and let me do final inspection on their planes. We just did the  planes. Our company just did the body of the plane, the small planes. I  did final inspection by using a dentist mirror a lot of the time because  you couldn   t see around the rivets in so many places without putting the  mirror on the other side. I learned to do that, and I went from there to  Ponca City and helped set up a plant there. Trained the girls for the final  inspection field there.  Finchum You must have been very good or liked what you were doing or  something?  Harris I always enjoyed what I was doing. I was an eager beaver I guess. I  enjoyed staying busy and learning new things. I went to work, went  from Ponca City to Mineral Wells  Texas  where my husband was at  Camp Wolters. I wouldn   t teach in the schools down there because I  wouldn   t walk off and leave a teaching position in the middle of the  year. Instead of teaching I went to work in a dress shop. I worked all the  time I was there in a dress shop. I enjoyed that thoroughly. Then, our  9  oldest son was born in Texas. He just had his seventieth birthday and he  is a retired teacher. Did all of his complete career in one school system.  Finchum That doesn   t happen too much these days.  Harris No, it doesn   t. It was in Sherman, Texas. He went right out of college to  teaching in Sherman. Then, he was head of the PE department in junior  high. Taught PE, Physical Ed. Helped build a new building, a new high  school building there. They let him assist, give some of his opinions on  how the PE department should be set up. He was a wonderful teacher.  Did a good job.  Finchum Did you go back into teaching?  Harris Oh yeah.  Finchum After the dress shop?  Harris Yeah, after we came back to Kansas. We had bought a house in Kansas  and put his mother in it while we were in service. Then, we came back  to there and sold our house. He had connections in Wichita. He went  into the Federal Land Bank and they, after some training, they sent him  to Vinita, Oklahoma. His first office was in Vinita at the Federal Land  Bank. He put in about twenty years at the Federal Land Bank. I taught  for all that time. I taught thirty-six years.  Finchum In Vinita or other places too?  Harris In Oklahoma.  Finchum In Oklahoma.  Harris Various parts of Oklahoma. I taught in Sweetwater, Garber, and Enid.  Then we came back to Vinita, they couldn   t get teachers there. They  had to have, at that day and time, they had to have so many accredited  teachers, degreed teachers, in order to qualify for their kids to get credit  for their high school graduation. My neighbor was on the school board.  He, of course, knew I was a teacher. They couldn   t get teachers enough  to give their kids credit. They agreed to keep my son if I would teach so  their daughter could graduate. That was in 1947. I enrolled sixty-eight  first grade students in that year. Of course, they had to divide them  down, but I still had a room full of kids. They just couldn   t get teachers,  qualified teachers at that time to take care of them.  Finchum That was right after the war too?  10  Harris Uh-huh.  Finchum So when did you retire?  Harris I retired in    78.  Finchum The education field changed quite a bit during that thirty-some years.  Harris Then I volunteered. I started immediately volunteering. I volunteered in  the hospital in McAlester for I think seven years. I did the front desk in  one of the hospitals. And I started traveling after I retired. I had another  high school teacher friend, or teacher friend, we traveled together for  several years. We visited the northeastern states together, and we visited  Canada. I   ve been in, I think, forty-four of the forty-eight states. Not  been    to    some of them, just driving through, but been through them.  Canada, and the Holy Land, and I visited, I think it was, six different  countries while I was on that trip. We were ten days on that trip to the  Holy Land. I think we were in six different countries. Some of them just  going through, but we were in there.  I know we were in one town, and the hotel where we were staying was  just a block over from where the prostitutes were. So a group of us  decided that we wanted to walk up the street and go down the street  where the prostitutes were. We had a Methodist minister in our group.  He was fooling around and I looked and a main body of us got ahead of  him and we heard him coming down the street in a dead run, and he  says,    I thought I better get up here with a group so they could verify  what I was doing. I would hate to have them report to my group that I  was visiting in the red light section. That I was caught visiting in the red  light section alone.    (Laughs) So he had to get with us.  Finchum Your husband didn   t travel with you? It was your friend.  Harris My husband passed away in    67. I did my traveling after that. He was  not a traveler. We did some traveling together, but I did most of my  traveling after he passed away. He had a heart condition. I have been  widowed since that time.  Finchum You have lived in quite a few places in Oklahoma.  Harris I   ve been pretty well all over Oklahoma, uh-huh.  Finchum And you kept up with friends along the way?  Harris Uh-huh. I went back and visited my high school, my closest friend in  high school after my husband died. I went back down there. They   re, of  11  course, all gone. I don   t have a lot of friends left frankly. Why I lived  this long, I have no idea.  Finchum That would be one of my questions? I won   t have to ask. No idea at all?  Harris Well     Finchum Have you eaten your vegetables?  Bishop What   s your secret?  Harris I   ve had that question a thousand times. I don   t have any. I started out at  three and a half pounds and I weighed twelve pounds when I was a year  old. I weighed a hundred pounds when I got out of college, I   ve never  had a weight problem.  Bishop You were a three pound baby?  Harris Three and a half pounds.  Finchum Were you born at home?  Harris Uh-huh.  Finchum Midwife or a doctor?  Harris A doctor.  Finchum Were you a preemie to be that     Harris Yes, uh-huh. My doctor named me. He wanted to name me Mary  Magdalene, and my mother wouldn   t let him. He named me Mary  Loraine, so I   ve carried that name.  Bishop Where would you keep a baby that small?  Harris Well, my story of my life says that my first cradle was my dad   s boot  box and from that to a dresser drawer. Course Momma carried me  around when I was a year old at twelve pounds, not very big. She had a  number of people tell her that that was one they wouldn   t raise. And I  guess I   ve been one of the healthiest. I have never been ill enough to go  to a hospital. I   ve been for different reasons, broken bones, and that sort  of thing. I have never been ill enough to go to a hospital. My doctor  tells me   I have one appointment a year with my doctor, unless I need  her. I call her if I need her. When she checks me out, she says,    Well  you   re well.     12  Finchum On any medicine?  Harris I take very little medicine. I take two light medicines for high blood  pressure. In recent years I have had to take medicine for elimination.  That   s basically all I take. I take, occasionally, Tylenol. I take four pills  a day. Two for my high blood pressure, to keep that regulated, and then  for my elimination problem.  Finchum Do you eat pretty much anything you want?  Harris I have a lot of indigestion. I   ve had it all my life. I have to be kind of  careful about some foods I eat. I eat very little meat and I was interested  in your comment on people our age eating meat. I never eat a whole  serving of meat. I will eat oh, six or eight bites. That   s the content of  my meat eating. That   s mostly chicken and fish anymore. A little beef,  no pork, other than ham. I will eat ham occasionally. No pork other than  ham. I   ve had a little indigestion problem all my life. Nothing serious,  but enough to be aggravating at times.  Finchum Are you a vegetable eater?  Harris I eat lots of vegetables and quite a lot of fruit. I particularly eat  vegetables for lunch every day. I drink V8 Juice with my meal at noon  every day.  Finchum Well, when you were younger and your mother was doing the cooking,  would you have meat?  Harris Oh yeah, we always had meat. She had to feed four men, my dad and  the three boys. I used to tell my younger brother (he used to steal my  cut of meat), that food had to go to his legs, because his stomach  couldn   t hold it. (Laughter) All he ate.  Finchum Did she do a lot of canning?  Harris Oh yes, she canned. First thing I bought when I had my first salary  check was a pressure cooker. I was in 4-H when I was in school. I  sponsored it and taught it. That was when I taught at Garber, I had 4-H,  had 4-H there. I bought my first pressure cooker. My mom had a  pressure cooker that would hold seven quarts. Mine held five. Mine had  a top sealer on it. Hers just had the little deals that you had to screw  around, seven or eight little deals along the top. She had to screw every  one down to hold the pressure. She canned beef. I never did can beef,  but she did. She   d can a quarter of beef at a time. When I was a kid, the  neighbors would get together and kill a calf and divide it in quarters.  13  She would pressure hers. She would stay up all night and cook until   of  course then we didn   t have refrigeration to take care of it.  Bishop Well, where would you put it?  Harris We had a concrete cellar. It was shelved. We had a bed down there and  then shelves on both sides of it. That just fit the different size fruit jars,  the quarts, the halves, half gallons. You could just slide them back in  there. She canned enough fruit and vegetables to last us year around.  Finchum She had to be organized and determined, didn   t she?  Harris Uh-huh, and I came up that way.  Bishop You said you had orchards. Is that right?  Harris When I was a child, uh-huh, when we lived at Sweetwater we had an  orchard. We had currants, and blackberries, dewberries, and two  different kinds of grapes. We had white and purple grapes. Any number  of different types of peaches, pears, apples, plums, several different  kinds of plums.  Bishop Plums in Oklahoma?  Harris Uh-huh.  Bishop Wow   Harris I loved them.  Finchum That was before global warming. (Laughs) We had water. A little bit of  rain.  Harris Yeah, we had sandy soil out there. It didn   t require as much moisture as  a lot of soils did. My dad had section land out there. It was all pretty  sandy. I can   t remember a time when they didn   t have a herd of  Guernsey   s. As I said, my younger brother and I made pets out of them.  We were both milking them before we were old enough to go to school.  Bishop Did you give them any names?  Harris Oh, we had them all named. Every one of them had a name   Finchum Did he farm with a horse and plow?  14  Harris Yeah. I drove a cultivator. My younger brother and I would drive the  cultivators from one end of the rows to the other, and my dad and the  older boys would be hoeing at the end of the rows. They would turn our  cultivators for us. We weren   t big enough to. We drove teams and  mules. We weren   t big enough to turn them at the ends of the rows. We  could control them, one end to the other. In turn, we could do the  cultivator work and my dad and the older boys did the hoe work.  Finchum The girls had to work right alongside the boys?  Harris Well, my older sister, she was the oldest in the family. She was away  going to college and teaching school. She wasn   t home after I was any  size. She was the oldest of seven children and I was next to the  youngest. I didn   t really know her until after I married. We didn   t have  anything much in common until after that.  Finchum She went into education too.  Harris Uh-huh.  Bishop What were holidays like at your home growing up?  Harris Oh, we had our regular Christmases and we didn   t have Christmas trees.  The little country school I went to, they took a dead peach tree, and  decorated it for our Christmas tree at school, because we did not have  evergreens in Western Oklahoma. We didn   t have a Christmas tree at  our home because there wasn   t room for it, but we did have a Christmas  and a Christmas dinner. My mom was an excellent cook. I learned from  her plus the two ladies I worked for in college. They were both German  women. They were both excellent cooks. I get the benefit of three good  women in my cooking ability.  Bishop What was your favorite dish?  Harris I bake pies. I don   t guess there is any kind of a pie that I haven   t baked.  I still   it got out around here somewhere that I bake pies, and I still  bake some here for people, but I put a good price on them, so I don   t  have too many coming back for seconds. (Laughter)  Finchum Make your crusts from scratch?  Harris Yes, I still do.  Bishop What is the secret ingredient to a good pie crust?  15  Harris Two cups of flour, four tablespoons of Crisco, and I have a little glass  that I measure my water in, and ice water, and a dash of salt. I made  those last week and I have three. I make them in the pans just like I was  going to bake them, and then freeze them. It takes me about thirty  minutes to come out with a silk pie. While my crust bakes in the oven, I  cook my filling. I can come out with a pie in thirty, forty minutes.  Bishop Wow   Finchum What kind of filling do you usually do?  Harris Coconut cr  me is very popular and then I have invented one. I cannot  remember that I ever had a recipe for this. Use your regular cr  me  filling and add in three tablespoons, rounding tablespoons of peanut  butter and vanilla flavoring. That makes a delicious mixture. It is called  peanut butter cr  me pie. I can   t decide whether I ever found a recipe for  that or whether I just cooked it up. Anyway, it   s my son   s favorite pies,  silk pies. I make a regular pie, we was talking about rhubarb. I cook my  rhubarb into a sauce. I make a regular cr  me filling and put it in the  crust and then I take the rhubarb, and go around the outside edge of the  pie and put a layer of rhubarb about that far around. Then, make the  meringue and put it over all that and brown it in the oven.  Finchum That sounds good too.  Harris It is good.  Finchum Are your recipes written down somewhere or are they all in your head?  Harris Most of them are up there. I do have a recipe cabinet. Occasionally I  have to refresh my memory on something that I had made. Be sure I get  all the ingredients in. I thoroughly enjoyed my cooking. I enjoyed  cooking, but of course I don   t do much over here. I still make pies, and  my kids, any of them that come, expect to have pie when they get here.  (Laughs)  Bishop Even today?  Harris Even today. I had, last week, I had   my oldest grandson and his family  are missionaries in Kazakhstan, and they were in the states for a three  month furlough. They spent two days with me. We had pie. They had  pie. He was visiting someone that had been in Kazakhstan out, well I  think they met them in El Reno. They came in from Elk City I think.  They met them in El Reno, and I had gotten them reservations in the  motel at Yukon. Then, I had pie. He had told me to go ahead and play  my games.  16  I play games here on Mondays. I play Canasta here at twelve o   clock.  We play about three hours. Then, I play bridge at six thirty in the  evening on Wednesday. I play bridge two and three days, three times a  week. Different games. I don   t play on Saturday and I don   t play on  Wednesday. Other than that, I play a game of some sort, one or two  every day. Then, I fill in for anybody that needs help here.  The first night I was here, my son and daughter-in-law got me all set up.  I knew exactly how my furniture was going to fit in here. We brought it  in and set it down and it   s sitting right where it was sat when we put it  down, because you don   t need to change it. And after they went to their  room, they were playing games over in the game room in this building.  I went over there and they found out I played games. They wouldn   t let  me come home. Said,    We may need you.    I played cards the first night  I was here. (Laughs)  Finchum How had you learned to play bridge?  Harris I learned to play bridge in 1933, first year I went to college. We did not  have tables in our rooms, college kids, big enough for that sort of thing,  so we played bridge on our beds. Four of us, and we play that here. I  learned to play bridge that way in 1933.  Bishop That was during the Depression.  Harris Yes.  Bishop What was the Depression like for you?  Harris Well, living in the country, we had, it didn   t affect a lot of us as much  as it did those people that had to go to the grocery store every day. As I  said, we grew so much of what we ate. I don   t think I realized. Then, we  had our dairy cattle. We made a cream check every week. In fact, when  I was younger, my dad picked up in the neighborhood, in Sweetwater,  when we lived at Sweetwater, he had truck and he picked up cream for  all the neighbors and drove it into Elk City. My parents brought back a  hundred pounds of ice every Saturday night, and we had homemade ice  cream. That was our entertainment for Saturday night every week that  was making ice cream. That is during the summer months. We always  had ice cream. They brought in a cake of ice, wrapped in a heavy  container of some sort or another that kept it from melting too fast,  canvas.  Finchum What type of games would you play as a youngster?  17  Harris Well, we didn   t have organized games on the farm. As I said, we made  pets out of lot of the animals. Of course, we had cats and dogs that we  played with. We had bulldogs. They were special with us. In Western  Oklahoma, my dad had hounds because there was a lot coyotes in that  area. I can remember them, the coyotes would den in that soft soil. My  dad and the boys would find the den somewhere and they would dig  them up and they would pick up the young ones and their pelts, the boys  would take them, and they   d get I think maybe a dollar a piece for them.  That did away with the pups and took the skins. The government paid  for that sort of stuff. That was an interest for them, because Dad would  give them whatever they got out of it, you know, the two older boys.  We rode horses. We had horses to ride. Our horses were saddled. I   ve  ridden horses. I kidded my sons and told them I cut my teeth on a  saddle horn. We always had   I   ve ridden ever since I can remember. I  love horses.  Finchum Is that how you would get to school in your early schools?  Harris Well, no we didn   t. We lived within a little over a mile, mile and a  quarter, of our school when we were starting to school. The older boys,  of course, had to put up with us the first year until my younger brother  and I were able to manipulate that plow by ourselves. We went to a one-room  school there until I was in junior high school. Then we moved to  Tillman County, and I went to a small town school. I went to grade  school, two years, I guess I did the seventh and eighth grade in that  country school, one-room school. Had my first man teacher I know in  my seventh and eighth grade.  Then, we were both driving. Course we had a Model T. My younger  brother and I were both driving when we were still in grade school. I  learned to drive   my older brothers had cars. They had to drain their  radiators every night, because they   d freeze if they didn   t. We   d get to  drive the cars around the house. They had to drive around the house.  My younger brother and I would get to drive their cars around the house  if we   d fill up their radiators. (Laughs) That   s where we learned to  drive. We were both driving when we were in grade school, seventh and  eighth grade.  Finchum Wow.  Harris Then, of course when we started high school, we were able to drive  ourselves to school. We were three miles from the high school. We had  to drive when we started high school.  Finchum What would you take for lunch?  18  Harris Oh, Mom always had meats. We cured our own hams. Killed hogs and  cured our own hams. We always had our own meats. A good lot of the  time we   d have whatever meat she was cooking, our sandwiches would  be made of that. Of course we had chickens and our own eggs and other  stuff.  Finchum Did you have to kill the chickens yourself?  Harris I have, uh-huh.  Finchum Do you have a method?  Harris Well you had to wring their necks. Then, dip them in boiling water to  loosen the feathers and pull the feathers off. I did that a lot.  Finchum Did your mother sew?  Harris Oh yes  She and my sister both were good seamstresses, and  consequently I didn   t learn to sew. It was easier for me to mop the  floors or do the ironing and let them sew, one or the other or both. I  didn   t learn to sew until after I started teaching. I learned to sew on my  own, more or less. I knew enough about it from watching them that I  could carry on myself.  Finchum Did they make clothes for the boys too?  Harris They made shirts and clothes for the little kids of course. I know my  oldest son was a red head and I dressed him in white. I made both his  pants and his shirts when he was little. I liked to dress him in white.  Had a peaches and cream complexion with his red hair.  Finchum How did you keep those whites white?  Harris Oh, we had bleach and of course we used it. Momma used lye. I didn   t  use it much, but she did. She used the lye in boiling her clothes and had  a black pot out in the yard. She did. I didn   t do that. I had a washer.  Well, my mom had a washer too when I was in junior high and high  school. She had a Maytag. Of course, I had one when I was starting  housekeeping. I had a Maytag.  Finchum It was probably a happy day for her when she got one.  Harris Oh yes. She was glad to have it.  Finchum Did she quilt?  19  Harris Uh-huh. I quilted up until I came here. My friend that lives here in the   Spanish  Cove, she and I lived in Moore at the same time, and we  belonged to the same church. I came into the church, well they wanted  to give me the Women   s Aid, head of the women   s program. I wouldn   t  take it. I said,    I will co-chair it with somebody. I will not take it on my  own or by myself.    She had been chairman of that group. She and I co-chaired  the Bazaar for our church for ten years. I came over here in  November, and they came in January. We   re still friends and do a lot of  things together yet.  Finchum What year did you come?  Harris I came over here in    09, in November    09. I drove until I was ninety-five,  and I came over here and got settled in then I gave my car away. I  didn   t think I needed to be keeping up a car. I gave it to my  granddaughter.  Finchum When you were quilting, did you have a favorite pattern?  Harris No, I chose my patterns. You could get when I started quilting, and I  bought one early, a little table that broke down in pieces and you put it  up together. You had different methods of fastening your quilt onto the  frames. I did a lot of quilting when we were, I made baby quilts when  we were co-chairing the Bazaar over here. I made them every year. I  quilted up until I came over here. I quit quilting. I can   t quilt anymore. I  lost part of the use of my right hand, but I don   t hurt. I have very little  pain. I have had very little pain in my life. Why I have been so healthy I  don   t know.  Finchum It   s riding those horses.  Harris I guess that   s part of it.  Finchum Being outside in the fresh air.  Harris I always walked a lot. I   ve walked a lot. I walked around this three or  four times before I   d quit when I first came over here. I don   t walk that  much now. I walk somewhere every day. I walk back and forth to lunch  every day. Then, usually if it   s too hot or too cold to walk outside, I will  go over here and walk the length of this building back and forth until I  get tired of walking. I still walk somewhere every day.  Finchum That   s good.  Harris Yeah, it   s kept me going. Then, I exercise three times a week.  20  Finchum What type of exercise?  Harris Stretch and strengthening. Then Debbie, well you didn   t meet here I   m  sure. She sat right across the aisle from where I sat today. Something  was said about the type of exercise that I was doing, and that they were  amazed that I could do some of them that I do. Squats, that came out as  a headline in the paper over here.    A hundred years old and still doing  the squats.    (Laughter) One of the girls said something to her one day  this week when we were exercising. She keeps her eye on me, I know  she does. She tries not to do it, but I know she watches me to see how I  respond. I do anything that anybody else does over there. We   ll stand in  front of our chairs to do the squats, she says in case we don   t make that  squat we can sit down. She watches to see that I make that in case, but I  can do that.  We take our elbows and put them on our knees and do the elbows on  the opposite knees for twenty five, thirty times. I know that she  commented on the fact that I was able to do that. I do anything that  anybody else does as far as exercise is concerned. If I get tired   I don   t  go to the bars and do that. I really don   t, because I   ve had surgery on  my left knee and hip both. I don   t want to put my weight much on my  leg. They do exercises up there one leg at a time, so I don   t do that  because I just don   t want to put that extra strength on those two  operations. I am able to get around, and I am thankful that I   m able to  get around.  Finchum Well, how much sleep at night do you get?  Harris I love to read in the middle of the night. I may take an early nap. I  seldom ever go to bed before midnight. I read a lot.  Bishop What type of things do you read?  Harris I may take a nap almost every day.  Bishop What is your preferred reading?  Harris Oh, I read everything that is put in front of me. I just finished reading, I  don   t know if I told you or not, the Bill O   Reilly wrote the Killing of  Christ  Killing Jesus . I just finished that. I relived my trip to the Holy  Land when I read that.  Bishop You   ve been to the Holy Land?  21  Harris Uh-huh. I relived my trip to that, when I read that book. I just finished  that a couple weeks ago. In fact I just took it to my friend and I brought  it back yesterday. I still have it. I haven   t taken it back to the library. I  haven   t decided that I   m not going to read again so I haven   t taken it  back. I read everything. I read biographies. I like to read. We have an  excellent library here. I have anywhere from one to a dozen books over  here all the time. If I pick up one that I don   t like, I put it down and pick  up another one.  Bishop What do you generally like to read? Fiction, biographies     Harris I read a lot of biographies and I read a lot of fiction. I have several  authors I must have. I must have six or eight authors that I like to read. I  read all them.  Bishop Who do you read? What type of authors?  Harris Oh, I can   t tell you the names, of very many of them anyway. I know  what they are and I can find them.  Bishop That   s all that counts.  Harris That   s what   s important.  Finchum Have you always done that or just picked it up?  Harris Oh no, I have always read.  Finchum Always been a reader?  Harris I was thinking the other day about the first book that I read, Man  Without a Country. You probably never heard of the book.  Bishop What was the name again?  Harris Man Without a Country.  Bishop Man Without a Country.  Harris Uh-huh. I remember that. I was thinking about how   I have to read at  night when I go to bed. If I don   t, my mind starts working and I go back  in history. I go back. Some part of my life will come to my mind and I  will lay there and relive that, and I get as wide awake as a hoot owl. I  have to get up and read to put myself back to sleep. I   ll be setting here  reading a lot of times anywhere from twelve to one o   clock. Sometimes  I will get up at three or four. I   ll be wide awake and have something on  22  my mind and can   t go back to sleep, so I get up and read until I can go  back to sleep, read myself to sleep again.  Finchum Then get up at what time?  Harris I wake up at seven o   clock almost every morning. I won   t miss it fifteen  minutes.  Finchum Watch much Television?  Harris Yeah, I watch a lot of the game shows. That   s basically what I watch  besides the News. Animals, I watch, I watch animal shows, especially if  horses come on or cattle. I love to watch shows with cattle. There is one  show that they train horses. I love to watch that. This guy is a rancher  and he trains horses as a profession. I like to watch him. He   s on every  day. I don   t watch him every day, but I do watch him. It   s interesting  the things that he does in training horses. He sees them in different  stages. This one show that I watch, they bring herds of wild horses in  and put them in corrals and they will pick them out and saddle them. I  enjoy that. I never get bored with myself. I do enjoy being by myself,  but I enjoy friends too. Like I said, I play some sort of games almost  every day and sometimes twice a day. I always meet people when, I  enjoy meeting people. My exercise instructor, she says that I do my  exercises most of the time while smiling. (Laughter)  Finchum Humor and laughter has been important?  Harris I wear a smile more than I do a frown. That   s just a big part of my life.  Finchum Well, you mentioned one child. Do you have     Harris I have two sons. One of them was in medicine and he got hurt. He has  been in terrific pain for a good lot of his adult life. Right now, he and  his wife both are unable but they are able to take care of themselves,  which I   m thankful for. I came here because I did not want to be a  responsibility for either one of them. I   ve always been independent. I  like it.  Finchum Come a long way from three and a half pounds.  Bishop What was it like to be a mother?  Harris Oh I love my kids. I enjoyed them. My older son, he is eleven years  older than the other one.  Bishop Oh wow   23  Harris That just kind of happened. I was married nearly six years before he  was born. I had him by myself, pretty much. His dad was on the road a  lot. He did whatever I did. If I was making the bed, he would help make  it too. Of course, he was not a lot of help at that time, but he helped me  do it. We   re still real close. He calls me every Saturday morning. They  come up about once every two months, something like that, and spend  the night, he and his wife.  And my other son lives over in Norman. He was in x-ray and nuclear  medicine and a three hundred pound man started to fall, and he was x-raying  him, he grabbed him and twisted his body. They have never, the  doctors have never been able to find the source of the pain that he has.  It   s in a nerve but they can   t find it. He   s had open heart surgery twice  trying to find but they haven   t been able to find it. He   ll find something  that relieves him a little bit, but he   s never been without pain.  Bishop Did you ever go on family vacations?  Harris Up until my youngest son was in high school, we   d go on vacations.  We   d practically travel   we went to the southern states and my son, he  was just under where he could drive. He wasn   t quite old enough to  drive. He was bored to death because he was at that stage where kids  get bored pretty easily. His dad and I went on several vacations when he  was younger. As I said, I had my older son by himself a lot of his life  until the other one was born because his dad was on the road a lot. He  went to school where I taught. When he started school, why he, in fact I  had him in my room the first year, which I would not do the second  time.  Bishop Why is that?  Harris Well, it   s just something that any teacher should never do is to have her  own child in her room. At that time, I either had to have him in my  room or else he would have had to go to another part of town to the first  grade. It was inconvenient for both of us. He didn   t want to go and I  didn   t want him to go. I pretty well lived with my kids as they grew up.  Whatever I did, they did.  Finchum How would you discipline them if they needed it?  Harris I had a ping pong paddle. (Laughter) Made a lot of noise, didn   t hurt  much. Made a lot of noise.  Bishop More for effect?  24  Harris Huh?  Bishop It was more for effect.  Harris Just picking it up, it had a lot of pressure. (Laughs) It always laid on top  of the refrigerator. I knew where it was.  Finchum They didn   t try to hide it?  Harris They couldn   t. They couldn   t reach the top of the refrigerator. (Laughs)  Finchum Was church an important part of     Harris I was very active in church. I guess I have taught every Sunday school  class from kindergarten to junior high school. I never would go into  high school to teach. I think I held every office in the Women   s Society.  Did about everything there was to do in those things.  Finchum Well, as a child, did you go? Was it important to your parents?  Harris Oh yes. I went to Sunday school. My dad liked to sing. He led singing a  lot. I went to Sunday school a lot. I joined, became a Christian when I  was eleven in a cow pasture in a tent. Then, I joined the Methodist  church when I was sixteen, in high school. I was baptized in the city  swimming pool because there was not enough water anywhere else to  do it. Then, from the time I had my kids, I have been active in Sunday  school. As I said, I think in the children   s department, I probably held  every office there was to hold from kindergarten through junior high.  Finchum Did you sing in the choir?  Harris I did sing in the choir when I was in college.  Finchum Can carry a tune.  Harris Well, I used to. I don   t know if now I could.  Finchum Did you play the piano?  Harris No. I didn   t have any music ability and since I worked all the way  through college, I had no opportunity to have any kind of lab classes or  anything of sorts or take any extra lessons or anything. No, my gifted  area is cooking.  Finchum What was the favorite thing that your mother cooked for you?  25  Harris Well, she was an excellent meat cook of any kind. She had lots of  experience. She was an excellent meat cook, so I learned to cook  anything. I made my first biscuits on the stove door, because I wasn   t  big enough to reach the top of the cabinet, the stove door where it  opened up. A coal stove, we used wood or coal, either one in, the cook  stove. The oven door would open out straight and I had my pan that I  made biscuits in on that door, because I couldn   t reach the top of  cabinet. That   s where I made my first biscuits.  Finchum What did you use? Flour I know, but do you remember the rest of the  recipe?  Harris Oh, in that day and time, you put flour in a pan and made a hole in your  flour and put your ingredients down in that. You worked your dough up  in that to the point where you could handle it. Then, you lifted it out of  that and put it over on a floured board. Roll it out and cut your biscuits,  only I got good enough that I could squeeze them off and made them  almost as perfectly as if I cut them. I did a lot of that rather than going  to the trouble of flouring the board and rolling them out and cutting  them. It was a lot faster.  Finchum So that would be like plain flour?  Harris Well, we had, we grew our own wheat when we lived in Tillman  County and took it to Altus and had it ground. We had our own flour  and cornmeal both. When I was a kid, we had to buy our cornmeal. We  didn   t grow corn in Tillman County.  Finchum Then, baking soda and salt?  Harris Baking soda, salt, and then a lot of times, our shortening would be  separated cream, because we had plenty of that. Of course Momma  made her own lard too. A lot of times, we would use the separated  cream to make the biscuits. Cup of cream, something of that sort. Half a  cup of cream along with our baking powder, salt, or soda. If we used  buttermilk, we used soda instead of salt. I can   t hardly remember a time  when I didn   t make biscuits.  Finchum Made them for your kids?  Harris For my family, when I lived at home with my parents is when I made  my first ones, then of course I always made homemade biscuits for my  family after I married. Dinner rolls, I loved to make dinner rolls. I made  those up until I came here.  Finchum Making me hungry. I   m ready for some chocolate pie.  26  Harris Okay, I do that too. (Laughter)  Finchum Do any icebox pies?  Harris Yeah, I made icebox pies. Used the graham cracker crust.  Finchum Is there anything left on your bucket list that you want to do and  haven   t?  Harris Well, there is not much within my ability that I haven   t done, I guess. I  still like to cook, and I occasionally fix a meal for my family when they  come. I occasionally   and I make angel food cakes more than the other  kind of cakes anymore.  Bishop I don   t know if we asked, but did you ever expect to live to a hundred?  Harris Heavens no. Never occurred to me.  Bishop How did you celebrate your hundredth birthday?  Harris Well, I had all my family here. I had a niece that came from the state of  Washington. I don   t have a very large family, but I had all my family  here. We had a dinner over in the dining hall. We have a private dining  room over there in the dining hall. I had it reserved so we had a private  dinner over there. We took pictures. Then, I had one friend that lives in  Maine. They spend their summers here. She has a gorgeous voice and  she sang for our program. She still sings for me almost every time she  comes. She is here now.  Finchum What did she sing? Besides happy birthday.  Harris I really don   t remember what she sang, but she sang several songs.  Finchum You didn   t choose them, she chose them?  Harris No, she chose what she sang. She chose something that was suitable for  the occasion. Her friends, or the couple that I was speaking of that came  here shortly after I did and said her mother and I worked together in the  church. That   s Sherry. She is their oldest daughter and her husband is a  college professor in Maine. He teaches up there about seven or eight  months out of the year. They have a home there, then they have a house  in Norman for the three or five months that they   re here. Both of their  parents live here. His mother lives in Moore, or right now she is living  with them. She never has been this long. She lived in Moore. She  consequently came back here, so they still come back.  27  Finchum You get to hear her sing some.  Harris Uh-huh. Oh, she has a lovely voice.  Bishop When history is written, what would you like it to say about you? How  do you want to be remembered?  Harris Well, I think I am a people person. I   ve always loved people. I love to  be around them. I make it a point to be around people. In fact, I think I  was a good teacher. I think I was a good mother. I think I am a good  friend. I enjoy doing things for people. I share my cooking. Almost  every time I make a pie, I share it with somebody. In fact, the husband  of this couple that I was speaking of, I share almost every pie that I  bake with him. She is a diabetic and doesn   t do baking. He gladly  comes over and picks up my pies. I   ll call him and tell him,    I   ve got a  half pie over here that has your name on it.    It won   t be ten minutes and  he   ll be here to pick it up. He   s, they   re a real happy couple. They   re  nice to be with. They   re especially nice to me. We grocery shop  together about every two weeks at Walmart. In fact, we were going to  go today and it rained us out. I think I   ve always been a congenial  person. I have mixed with people well, of all ages. I just love life.  Finchum Has contentment come easy?  Harris Uh-huh. After my husband died, I never dated. I never had a date. I  never wanted to. I still don   t want to. (Laughter) I   ve been very  independent. If I decided to drive across the state of Oklahoma, I   d do  it. I lived at McAlester for many years. I had a brother that lived in  Amarillo. I thought nothing about driving from McAlester to Amarillo,  Highway 66 by myself. I always kept my cars is in good shape. I   d take  them to one of my friends who took care of my cars. I   d take my cars  for him to check out before I decided to take off somewhere. I   d leave  here in the dark because I knew this area of town, the country roads,  and by the time I got to the main highways, it would be daylight and I  could drive right straight on through to Amarillo.  Finchum Did you know how to change your own tire?  Harris Oh yeah, I   ve changed lots of tires.  Finchum That   s always a good thing for     Harris Not lately, but I have changed a lot of tires. I have the ability to do it if I  had to. I haven   t changed one in a long time, but. So have I wore you  out?  28  Finchum We worked through our questions. Is there anything else you want to  add before we close?  Harris Not that I know of.  Finchum Well, it   s been great. Thank you so much.  Harris You   re quite welcome.  -------  -------
