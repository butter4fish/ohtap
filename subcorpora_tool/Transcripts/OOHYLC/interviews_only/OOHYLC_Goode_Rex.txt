 Finchum Today is November 6, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop. We are with Oklahoma State University. Today we are in  McAlester, Oklahoma to speak with Sam     Rex     Goode. This is part of  our Oklahoma One Hundred Year Life project. Thank you for having  us.  R. Goode You   re welcome. I   d have felt better if I felt better. (Laughs)  Finchum Can you tell me your birthday?  R. Goode February 27, 1915.  Finchum Where were you born?  R. Goode Poteau. It   s not Poteau, but it   s a little town  Bokoshe, Oklahoma  close  to you might say  Arkansas . I can   t think of the name of it. I moved up  here when I was, they moved up here when I was a year old, to  McAlester.  Finchum Okay. What did your parents do for a living?  R. Goode Ever since I was born they farmed. My grandpa, he was kind of a  rancher. They dealt in trading and buying cattle and stuff like that,  selling. Grandpa Goode did. Grandpa Battles, he was all of it, ranching,  farming, lawyer. I mean police, you might say, (laughs) at one time.  Finchum Were they from Oklahoma?  R. Goode From Oklahoma?  Finchum Uh-huh.  5  R. Goode Yeah, yeah. Now Goode, I guess he moved into Oklahoma. I think he  was raised in the East. Came across on a ship  from England  and  settled there and then gradually moved this way, moved from the East.  Finchum Okay.  R. Goode Dad had three brothers and two sisters. He was the last to go. They all  lived around here at one time. Then pulled out, of course, to better  pastures you know.  Finchum Where did you go to school?  R. Goode I started in at Ashland. Freshman in high school I went to Cordell. We  moved out there. Dad was working out there at a gin. We went out  there. Then moved back down here. I made that cabinet right there  when I was a freshman. (Laughs) That thing is about eight-five years  old.  Finchum You like to work with wood?  R. Goode That was one of my subjects. Of course, I had the other in school.  Eventually I was a carpenter too. I have been everything and nothing.  (Laughter)  Finchum Your dad worked with the cotton gin?  R. Goode Huh?  Finchum Your dad worked with the cotton gin?  R. Goode Yeah.  Finchum Did you have to pick cotton?  R. Goode I didn   t like to kill a pig but I liked to pull bolls. I   ve made quite a bit of  money at twenty-five cents a hundred pound. (Laughs)  Finchum You grew up on a farm?  R. Goode Huh?  Finchum You grew up on a farm?  R. Goode Yeah.  6  Finchum Have to milk cows?  R. Goode Yeah. Yeah   all farm work.  Finchum Did you farm with a horse or a tractor?  R. Goode Huh?  Finchum Did you farm with a horse?  R. Goode A horse and after I married, I bought me a tractor. I bought a place and  finally I sold it. There was one year I didn   t make   I was doing good. I  bought a place and had some cattle. I did all right on the farm. One  year, the worst part of farming, everything you made, you put it back.  Boy that year I didn   t make one crying penny. I went in the hole, so I  called the government. The war was going on, and I was getting out of  it. I told them, I said,    I tell you what, I can   t farm no more, not until I  get some money. I   m going to work at the Navy.    So I come over there  and worked two years. Well, (laughs) it   s kind of funny. I found out that  farming wasn   t no easy way to make money. (Laughs)  Finchum What did you do for the Navy?  R. Goode Inventory. We inventoried all the buildings, ammunition building,  checked on it. That   s what it was.  Finchum Here?  R. Goode Yeah, right here in McAlester. It was big, the Navy. It was out there at  Savannah. It still is out there.  Bishop The ammunition?  R. Goode Yeah.  Finchum Ammunition?  R. Goode Huh?  Finchum Ammunition?  R. Goode Ammunition depot.  Finchum You didn   t serve in the military because you were farming?  7  R. Goode Yeah. When I went back there, I came to McAlester and started doing  carpenter work. I did that. Finally I went to work for Hudgins  Construction. That way I had cash wages all the time. I went with him a  lot. I built a lot of homes under him and there were some in McAlester,  and other places, a lot of schools, and I don   t know.  Finchum You were good with your hands?  R. Goode Huh?  Finchum You were good with your hands?  R. Goode Yeah. I   d have to say that carpenter work was my best occupation. It  was easy, if you know what I mean. It was easy. There was no real  heavy work. When there was heavy work, there was more men there to  do it, to help. From there, well I did that until I was pretty old. When I  carried a load of shingles upon a house, I could tell it. It   d hurt, you  know. (Laughs) So I went out to the hospital and there was a new boss  out there, Donell. He was hiring some men to go to work out there. I  went out to put an application in. Well, it happened to be there was  another man working there at the hospital with assistants. I asked him. I  said,    I   d like to get ahold of Donell if I could.    He took me to him.  I told him what I was after. I asked him about a job. He wanted to know  what I was doing. I said,    Carpenter.    He said,    Why would you want  the job I have when you   re doing carpenter work? How long have you  been doing it?    I told him. He said,    Well why?    And I was getting up  pretty old then. I said,    Well I   ll just be plain with you. It   s getting to  where the heavy work and the carpenter work is getting me down fast  like carrying shingles or lifting. I   m just looking for a good job and I  plan to just do it with my hands and feet.    So he hired me. (Laughs)  I was with him. He was building a hospital. He was a hospital  administrator. Finally he says,    Rex, I want to put you on a different  job.    I say,    What   s that?    He said,    I want you to take over the  maintenance.    I said,    Whoa, wait a minute. I   m not no doctor, I   m not  no nurse. There   s very little I know about a lot of stuff in the hospital.     He said,    Well I know, but you can learn.    I stayed with him. He finally  went to Ardmore and built a hospital out there. Some of the boys went  with him. I stayed here. I stayed with that until I retired. Then social  security was my life. From now on, except if I wanted to make a little  dollar or two, I   d get out and   if I needed a soda pop, I   d have to make  a nickel to pay for it. (Laughs) That is just about my life until I got out  here.  Finchum What year did you retire?  8  R. Goode Well, let   s see. I retired when I was sixty-five.  Finchum So, 1980.  R. Goode About twenty years ago.  Finchum What year did you graduate from high school? Thirty something?  R. Goode What year   thirty-four I think it was.  Finchum Did you play basketball?  R. Goode Yeah, football and baseball.  Finchum All of it.  R. Goode Yeah. I had a chance to go to college, but I passed it up.  I was offered a  scholarship to play basketball, football, and baseball at the University of  Chicago.  You know in    34, boy, a quarter in your pocket was good.  There wasn   t any nowhere. You couldn   t find one. You had to look a  long time and then work hard for it.  But I don   t regret any of that right there because Mother passed away  when I was a senior. I stayed with Dad. We bached it, Dad and I. I  helped him. I worked on the farm just like he did. In the summer, I was  there all the time you know. So that was a job. Wasn   t no money in it  either, just a living, barely a living. That was when times was rough.  Finchum During the Depression?  R. Goode Yeah. I mean, it was bad but we made it. That   s when I started getting  jobs on the side.  Finchum Like what?  R. Goode Carpenter work, just piddle job. Build a little thing or something like  that. I really didn   t get into the construction of a lot of it. Just fixing  something, you know. Dad, he was kind of that way too. Both of us  would work together. We   d get a half a day   s work and make a dollar a  piece, (laughs) that   s the truth. I worked a many a day for a dollar, one  dollar. You don   t believe me, just ask somebody else that was raised  like I was, didn   t have no occupation during those days.  Finchum Well, what would you do for fun?  9  R. Goode Oh, I didn   t go then like they do now. Fish, hunt, play ball, things like  that. Go see my girl every Saturday. Didn   t I? (Laughs)  M. Goode Thing is, I don   t know if you was married then. I   m not good with  keeping up with dates.  Finchum What would you do? Go dancing?  R. Goode Huh?  Finchum Would you go dancing?  R. Goode No, I didn   t then but after I married, I got to dancing. I still got the  shoes I wore out. You don   t believe it, do you? You don   t believe  they   re wore out? (Laughs) Them   s the first fancy shoes I ever had.  (Laughs) We danced in them too.  Bishop Have you been married one time or twice?  R. Goode Huh?  Bishop Have you been married one time or twice?  R. Goode Twice.  Bishop How did you meet your first wife?  R. Goode Went to school in the same school from day one. Only day we didn   t go  to the same school was when we moved that year to Cordell. We  graduated from high school at Kiowa together.  Finchum What was her name?  R. Goode O   Daniel. Cliffie O   Daniel.  Finchum Cliffie?  Bishop How many years were you married to her?  R.

Finchum He kind of looks like you.  M. Goode That   s his mother and daddy right up here. (Gestures)  R. Goode Altogether, I can   t complain on my life. This right here, messed our  lives all up.  M.Goode We thought we had it made.  Bishop You were married a second time. You   re currently married, right?  R. Goode You know, that   s kind of funny. I   ve known that girl (gestures to  Marian) ever since she was about that big. Her daddy and family and  all. I was up about like that. Well, I lost my wife. It   d been two years.  She   d lost her husband three years. We run together, somehow we  got   Oh yeah, I know how we got together too. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s good   R. Goode I went to a dance out there, old folk   s dance you know, every Saturday  night. I went in and there she set with her friend, her married friend. I  never noticed her and I happened to think,    Well that   s...    So I went  back and talked to her. We were laughing and cutting up. I told her,     We   ll dance in a minute.    It hadn   t started. She said,    I   ve never. This  is the first dance I   ve ever been to.    (Laughter) I said,    This is the first  dance you   ll ever dance then.    We did. She didn   t want to. I kept on. I  said,    I   ll dance the way I showed you.    Well, we danced a time or two,  and she kind of liked that. (Laughs)  M. Goode He   s a good dancer. I didn   t even know how.  R. Goode The next Saturday, I went to the dance, lo and behold there she was.  One thing lead to another.  Finchum What is her name?  11  R. Goode Marian.  Finchum How did you talk her into marrying you?  R. Goode I think that just happened. I don   t know. I refereed the ballgame  years  ago  and she played basketball.  Finchum Aw     R. Goode At that time, I was just trying to help her along. We just kept on until  we started dating. First thing you know, we were married.  Bishop You used to be a referee?  R. Goode Huh?  Bishop You used to be a high school referee or a grade school referee?  R. Goode Yeah, high school. I would call it high school, there at Ashland, some at  Kiowa, Stewart, Savanna and around.  Bishop Did you ever have any games you remember?  R. Goode Huh?  Bishop You have any stories from being a referee?  R. Goode No, I never did have any trouble.  Finchum Make any bad calls?  R. Goode I never   I could always go back. Oh course, a referee, you   re going to  hear those little digs but you just go on refereeing forget it like you  don   t see or nothing. I always called it just like I saw it.  Finchum Basketball   s changed a lot?  R. Goode Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, oh yeah. Those auditoriums were full.  Yeah. We lacked one game of going to the state tournament that year,  the year I graduated. When you go to getting in there, you hit bigger  schools. (Laughs) There we was, a little place, going to school, hit  Atoka. They always had a big team. We couldn   t do it. We played them  twice and they beat us. They didn   t run away with us. At times I get to  thinking about it and think that we could have won if we   d really been  thinking and been a lot better.  12  Finchum What position did you play?  R. Goode Forward. It wasn   t too much   in those days you was every position.  You know what, if it was something that happened and the other man  had somebody,  even  if he wasn   t your man and he had the ball, get  him. (Laughs) But this right here, it   s just, I don   t know.  Finchum Well when you refereeing, did you get paid?  R. Goode Two dollars I think, something like that. (Laughs)  Finchum So you did it for fun?  R. Goode Yeah, yeah. I never did have any trouble with coaches.  Finchum Did you have a black and white shirt?  R. Goode No. No. No   M. Goode Him and his wife run a little     R. Goode Huh?  M. Goode    hamburger stand out there. Just outside the school grounds.  Finchum She said you and your first wife ran a hamburger stand?  R. Goode Yeah, at the school. A couple lived there at the schoolhouse and put in a  hamburger joint, you know, for the school kids. I don   t remember, it  seems like they moved away from the place somewhere. They   d come  up to the house, we visited once and while. They come up there, asked  my wife, Cliffie, would she be interested in running that hamburger  shed. She said,    Well yeah.    She said,    Well you can have it if you  want. You can take it over.    They got what they wanted out of it. We  put in. I guess we run that two year.  Bishop Did you have a name for the business?  R. Goode No. Na, na, na.

I   m still the only one in there, in the  theatre at that time. When that thing came on, it did scare me. Back  then, it just  erring noise . I didn   t know what in the world.

I use to  say I   d take a drink with anybody if I knew him, a sup. A sup was a  drink for me. I got drunk twice in my life. The first time, a couple a  boys bought some, and we went to a big party. It was supposed to be a  party and it turned out to be a dance, so they go buy a pint. About every  fifteen minutes,    Oh, let   s go outside.    Here they go. They   d go out and  (drinking noises) and I   d just take a sup the first time and something  like that. (Laughs) I saw they were going to get drunk before I got  drunk. They got to forcing it a little bit and oh, I got drunk. It tickled me  though, I just vomited all over the back of his car. (Laughter)  M. Goode I guess you cleaned it up.  18  R.

Finchum What about the second time?  R. Goode Well, the second time was a little different. It was out of a half a gallon  jar. The car was full and I kept a sucking and a sucking and a sucking.     Rex, you haven   t drank any whiskey at all.    They kept on and kept on  drinking and handing it to me. I didn   t get that drunk that time. That is  the only two. I never did drink much.  Finchum Was church an important part of your growing up?  R. Goode Huh?  Finchum Was church and important part growing up?  R. Goode Well, when Mother was alive, we went to church every day. I didn   t go  to Sunday school too much. I usually went to the night churches, the  Men   s League where they sung and had a message, you know.  Finchum What church?  R.
