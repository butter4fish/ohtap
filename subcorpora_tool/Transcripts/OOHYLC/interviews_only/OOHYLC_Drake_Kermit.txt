Well, be hard to do really. There wasn   t any money, there wasn   t any  work, there wasn   t any jobs. Nobody had a nickel to buy anything with.  You could buy twelve dozen eggs for sixty cents. Oil was fifty cents a  barrel. All those freight trains going directly  west  and all those men  going to California to get a job and then coming back, they didn   t get it.  No, people really think that we   re in Depression now. We   re in better  times. They don   t know what it is.  Compared to then?  People didn   t have anything to eat. You come to town and at eleven  o   clock formed a soup line. Carried a bowl, get a bowl of soup. The  government fed them. The government has ruined the people. They  depend on the government now. What the president did at that time was  alright, but they should have stopped it. Should have stopped it. You  know, you can give a guy so much, and he   s going to expect it the rest of  your life.  9  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  It   s quite a difference isn   t it?  You could buy a place; I bought eighty acres of land for four hundred  dollars.  Here in Potawatomie?  Yes.  Well, did your parents own the property where they farmed?  Yeah, bought it in 1915.  Did they get to keep it through the Depression?  Yes.  Did they?  Got an oil well on it now.  That helps a little bit.  Got a check today.  Well, that   s pretty good then. So when you dropped out of school, you  went to work for other people?  Yeah, farming   well, helped Dad. My daddy   s older than Mother. His  first wife died.  And were you in the military?  No. I was too old when it broke out. I had a wife, and her (daughter),  and my mother. Four of us. I was class A/Class F farmer all the way  through. Never called up.

Sit a tub of water out in the sun. (Laughs)  What number of tub?  Number three.  And would you have to share the water with everybody else?  Well no, we   d usually get our own.  And how often?

We  played together.  26  Finchum  Drake  Bishop  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Ashworth  Drake  Ashworth  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Bishop  Drake  Bishop  Drake  Bishop  Drake  Bishop  Violin?  Yes.  You can play?  I don   t violin, I play guitar and French harps. I got microphones. I play  them both at once. I got a good amp I want to sale. I   ll never use it  anymore.  How did you learn to play those?  Well, one Christmas Mama bought my sister a little six dollar guitar.  Come home that Christmas Eve, saddled up on his knee. She got to  picking on it, and I did too   ten years old.  He also plays the piano.  Huh?  I told her you also play the piano.  Yeah, I play a little on this. I play it by ear. I don   t play it with music.  She   s a music teacher.  Playing by ear is kind of tough though, isn   t it?  Well, she said I can   t learn music because I know where to go by ear. I  can look at a songbook and tell you what key all the songs are wrote in,  but I can   t read music. I know all the keys.  What about radio? Did you ever listen to the radio?  Yeah, I   ve got an old country western station I get.  But did you listen to it as a kid growing up or     No, later in life.  Later in life.  When I retired, yes. No     Well, what do you think your secret to longevity is? Your secret to living  such a long life?  27  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Bishop  Drake  Bishop  Drake  Bishop  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  I think it   s hard work and the life you lived. I sure do. You sit around in  a chair all the time; you   re not going to be able to do anything. Can   t do  it. You got to be tough and used to it.  Do you remember seeing your first airplane?  Yes. Two-winged, seldom ever saw one. I went to the zoo at Springlake   Amusement Park  in Oklahoma City on the Fourth of July with my  uncle, four years old. One came over, and everybody was pointing and  looking at it. I   ll never forget it. I got a good memory.  You sure do. What about your first car?  Oh, I was grown and married. Bought it for thirty-five dollars. Drove it  ten years. Used to haul bales of cotton off of it, and I sold it for seventy-five.  (Laughter)  What kind was it?  Huh?  What kind of car?  A Ford.  Ford.  Ford pickup. Had a little bed and I put extra sides on it, tailgate down,  put fifteen hundred pounds of cotton   bales of cotton.  Well, what   s the biggest change you   ve seen, do you think?  The world as a whole. We   re in the last days, lady. If you   re reading the  Bible, know anything about it whatsoever, when you see things happen  now you   ve never seen or heard of, what else could you know? Have  you seen eleven inches of rain all your life? No. Now we   re having  them. They don   t stop. They just keep coming. Just keep coming.  Earthquakes. They   re not manmade. That   s not manmade. That   s what  they   re trying to say though. Taking all the oil out of the ground now,  making earthquakes. No, I believe the Bible, I don   t believe that stuff.  The Bible said,    Raise it to see if you   re saved   , and    If you love me,  keep my commandments   . The New Testament   s how to live and go to  heaven. The Old Testament is what   s going to happen in the last days,  Ezekiel and Isaiah. I can tell you all about it.  It sounds like you can.  28  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Ashworth  You all probably know it, but you don   t find many people believe in  this. There   s just two things counting now: jobs and football. I tell them,  the day Jesus comes, they   ll have a football game. (Laughter) I don   t  have anything to do with football. Nothing to do with football.  Do you follow any baseball since you played baseball?  Yeah. Well, you usually like one sport, and that would be mine.  Baseball. Do you follow a particular team?  Do what?  Do you follow a team? Baseball team?  I used to, I don   t   me and her did when she was little. She   d said,     Daddy, which one are we betting on?    (Laughter) We   d listen on the  battery-run radio, and the battery would last six months, dry cells.  Well, did your mother do much quilting?  All winter.  All winter?  I   d help them put the frames up in the house. We   d do them every night,  before we went to bed, wrap them up. Had four-four frames. I   d help to  lace them in. I know all about it.  In the kitchen or in the living room?  In the living room.  Living room.  Yes, they   d have quilting parties for the ladies. They   d come once a  week to our house or somebody else   s, and all quilt one quilt. They don   t  do that anymore.  Do you have one she made?  No, I don   t think so. I think we got the last one my wife made, and  somebody stole it.  I have all the ones his mother made.  29  Finchum  Drake  Ashworth  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Ashworth  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Bishop  Drake  Bishop  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Finchum  Drake  Okay that   s good. They   re safe somewhere then.  She got all my sister   s quilts. She had a bunch of them.  I have some other stuff.  Well, do you still have sweet potatoes to eat once in a while?  No. I buy them.  You buy them?  She candies them for me, and I got them now.  I candy them for him.  I like them candied, I don   t like them baked.  You want a little more sweet with your sweet potato?  Yeah, and they   re a dollar a pound   buy them jumbos. Where y   all live?  Stillwater and football is football.  I used to go up there in the sweet potato business. I can   t think of that  guy   s name that farms the Red Gold sweet potatoes. The county agent,  would get his wife to take me up there. They   d meet. They grew up a  new variety of potatoes called Red Gold. Very popular.  Now if history were written about you, what would you want it to say?  Well, I just let y   all say it. (Laughter) How will that work?  That   ll work. (Laughter)  You   ll probably say you never saw anyone like me. (Laughter)  Is there any story you want to tell us before we shut it off?  No, I think we   re about to the end of the line.  Well, I appreciate you talking to us.  Well, I appreciate you talking to me. Sorry it got so hot in here.  -------  -------  30
