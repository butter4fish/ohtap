 Finchum Today is July 22, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we are in  Lawton, Oklahoma to speak with Juanita Munn, and this is regarding  our Oklahoma One Hundred Year Life project. Thank you for having  us.  Munn You   re welcome.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Munn Well, I was born in 1915. May 2, 1915.  Finchum And where?  Munn Well, I would always say thirty miles east of Duncan, Oklahoma, out in  the country.  Finchum Out in the country.  Munn In Carter County.  Finchum Since you talk soft, we are switching that to right there.  Munn Okay.  Finchum Okay, thirty miles east of     Munn East of Duncan, Oklahoma.  Finchum Out on a farm?  5  Munn Well, kind of. Yeah, I guess you would call it the farm. All of the  chickens and hogs, I guess you would call it a farm.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Munn Yes, I did. I had three brothers and five sisters.  Finchum Wow, big family.  Munn Big family.  Finchum What number were you?  Munn I guess I must have been the eighth, I guess.  Finchum Close to the baby?  Munn Close to the baby, yeah.  Finchum Well, would you have chores to do?  Munn I sure did. (Laughs) Milking cows and gathering eggs from the  chickens. Picking the garden stuff, peas and tomatoes.  Finchum Your mother do a lot of canning?  Munn Yes, she sure did.  Finchum Did she sew much?  Munn Do what?  Finchum Did she sew?  Munn Yeah, we made the children clothes, the smaller children, clothes and  dresses and things like that.  Tisdale What did you make them out of?  Munn Flour sack. (Laughs)  Tisdale Flour sack.  Munn Feed sack. We   d buy feed for the hogs in great big sacks. I would take  them sacks and make the little girls    dresses. Uh-huh.  6  Finchum I bet they were pretty though.  Munn Come a long ways. (Laughter) Oh boy  They were. I had a picture of a  little girl with one of the little dresses on I made out of feed sack. They  was all right.  Finchum How would you do laundry?  Munn We had a washtub, galvanized tub, and we had a rubboard. I see one  hanging up down there in that old store down there, Cracker Barrel.  Tisdale Cracker Barrel.  Finchum Cracker Barrel.  Munn See one of them old rubboards down there hanging up. We used to rub  them.  Finchum Kind of rough on the knuckles?  Munn No, it was a rubboard. They had ridges on the board. We would put it in  that tub with water in it, and we would wash with the rubboard.  Tisdale Well, how did you get your soap?  Munn Huh?  Tisdale How did you get your soap?  Munn We   d make the soap.  Tisdale How did you make it?  Munn We had some P G  Proctor   Gamble  soap for a while we bought. A  lot of times we   d make it.  Finchum Out of what or how?  Munn Lard, grease, grease and lye. They had some lye, some stuff in a can,  real strong. They called it lye. We   d take that lye and that grease and  make soap. You seen that soap? You haven   t seen any of that soap?  Tisdale Uh-huh.  Munn (Laughs) Shirley has.  7  Tisdale No, I don   t remember that one.  Bishop How would you get your water? Did you have a well?  Munn We had a well, way on down. We had a well, but before we had a well,  we went to the creek, down, to the running water in the little spring or  creek. We had a boiling spring.  Finchum A hot one?  Munn Yeah, I wish I had a picture of all of it. It was a boiling water.  Tisdale Boiling out of the ground?  Munn Out of the ground. Pretty sand and water boiling up. We put a barrel  over that. Go there and dip the water out of that. That was our drinking  water. Otherwise we would get the water out of the creek to wash with.  But way on down we had a well. We dug a well. You know about a  well, don   t you?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Munn Well, we had one     Tisdale How did you dig the well? Did you dig it by hand?  Munn They dug it by their hands. You   d dig until you get the water. But way  on down, way on down further than that, they had something  water  dowsing  that they would bow it. It would bend and they   d dig on down  until they   d strike water. Then they   d put pipes down in there, then they  would put a pump on top of that. Pump the water up from down there.  That   s where we got the drinking water. Our water come from way  down in the ground, up through that pipe, on up to the surface. We have  one of them down there now. We got one of them wells down there  now, in Tatums. They had a bent, they   d bow it, and would dig till they  struck water. They put the pipes down there, jam the pipe down there,  way down there, bring it up to the surface. That   s how we got the water.  Finchum How would you get it from there to the house?  Munn Oh, we didn   t get it from there to the house. We got it out of the ground.  They dug until they found the water, but way back there, way back  there, we got the water out of the creek, out the boiling spring. Boiling  up water.  Tisdale How did you get it to your house?  8  Munn We didn   t get it to the house. We packed it in buckets.  Finchum Buckets.  Munn Bring up our night water. Bring it in buckets from the spring to the  house, in buckets. That was way back there. On the last, like I said, they  witched it, then would dig till they found the water. Then they put pipes  down through there and bring it up to the surface, with a pump on it.  Finchum How would you do bath time?  Munn Huh?  Finchum How would you do bath time?  Munn For water?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Munn Bath time, we would use that big old tub. Did I tell you about the tub?  We get the water out the creek. I call it the creek. I don   t know what  they call it now. They get the water from there and get it hot on the  stove. We didn   t know what gas was, so we had woodstoves. We put  that water on the stove, get it warm and pour it in that tub, and get in  there and wash. (Laughs) Take a bath.  Tisdale I used to hear my dad say they would let five people take a bath in one  tub of water. Is that true?  Munn No, we didn   t have that many. (Laughter) It was a good life. It was  good. I enjoyed it.  Finchum Did your mother have chickens?  Munn Mother had chickens. We   d make nests out of straw. Not straw, yeah,  little nests in a little box or something. Chickens would get up there and  lay eggs. We   d get them eggs and sometime we   d sell them for a dime a  dozen, (laughs) to buy like oil.  We had hogs. In the wintertime, when the weather was getting cool,  we   d first put him up in a pen and get him fat. Then, when we   d get him  fat, well we   d kill him. That   s bad that we killed them, but that is the  way you got to get meat, is to kill them. You have to kill them now.  They   d kill that hog. Then, had some salt, salt him down when they cut  him up. Lay him down on a board or something, and put that salt on it  9  and that would cure it. We had what you call a smokehouse. They   d  hang that meat up in that smokehouse. The hams, and the side, we call  that the bacon, then they would probably call that the shoulder. We   d  hang it up in that smokehouse. It would stay nice all winter. We   d cut  that meat and cook it. It was really good, and that salt would cure it up.  That   s the way we   d get our meat, and from the chickens. We   d kill the  chickens. That   s the way that we got our meat. We didn   t go to the store  for nothing. Nothing.  Finchum Well, how far were you from the store?  Munn Oh five or six   Oh we had a little country store, I guess four or five  miles or something like that. Get on the horse and go to the store. I  didn   t go, but the boys did and some of the younger ones. They   d go to  the store and buy. We didn   t buy much because we had our meat, and  we didn   t have to buy nothing hardly but the flour. I have known them  to take that corn out of our garden because in the summertime the  garden would kind of dry up and the corn would get hard. We   d shell  that corn off that, shell it off the cob, and let it get dry. Take it to a place  where they grind it up and make the cornmeal. We had to buy nothing  hardly but the flour and the sugar. We had our vegetables. We had our  milk, and we had our butter. We had our eggs. We didn   t buy much.  The only thing we had to buy is sugar and maybe flour.  I wish I had a way of showing the young people that you don   t go to  Walmart to get no milk. (Laughter) And eggs, we didn   t. All they know  is going to Walmart and getting the eggs and butter and stuff. We  made   We milked our cows and when the milk would get clabbered,  sour, cream would come to the top of that milk. That is the fresh milk.  When it sets so long cream would come on top of it. We   d take that  cream off of there, put it in a jar, and shake it and shake it, and shake it.  It   d come to butter. The cream would come to butter. Take that butter...  Tisdale I can remember that. You   d have to shake it about two hours.  Munn Nice yellow butter. We had a way of putting it in a mold, we called it a  mold, and mash it and it   d come out a pound of butter. We had our  butter. Nice yellow butter. Fresh butter. We didn   t go to Walmart to get  no butter. We didn   t know what Walmart was. That   s where we got our  butter.  Finchum How would you keep it cool?  Munn Well, we had a well we put it down in. Put it down in that well, that dug  well. Sometime we had   in our day, like I say, they dug a well with  10  their hands. Dig and dig until you get the water. And they put that butter  down in there. Keep it cool.  Way on, way on down, we had an ice man come around in the country  in a wagon, a little old truck or something, with ice, blocks of ice. He   d  sell ice blocks. We had a thing we call the icebox. We put the ice in that  box, little old icebox. You could keep ice in there, and keep butter and  eggs in there maybe. We   d buy that ice and put it in the icebox and keep  our butter and eggs and milk and stuff in there. Now that was way on  down there. That   s getting close to what they call a good time I guess.  (Laughs) I guess that is getting close to going to Walmart.  Finchum Well, where did you go to school?  Munn They had a school. They had one on down there in the country east of  Duncan, that I was telling you about, in a little town there east of  Duncan called Tatums. They had a school there. That is where we went  to school there. We went to school at Tatums, east of Duncan.  Finchum How many grades?  Munn Huh?  Finchum How many grades in the school?  Munn I think it went to twelve   nine. It might have went to nine then. Way on  down they started bussing the kids from Tatums to a little place up there  they call Fox, Oklahoma. It   s still there. Fox.  Finchum Don   t know that one.  Munn You ever been to Fox, Oklahoma? It   s there. It   s there now. They kind  of tore up Tatums School, when children got scarce and they started to  bus them from Tatums to Fox, Oklahoma. That   s still there yet, Fox,  Oklahoma. That   s where we went to school.  Finchum How many grades did you finish?  Munn I went to the ninth grade.  Finchum Then what did you do?  Munn Nothing. (Laughs) I didn   t do nothing.  Finchum When did you get married?  11  Munn Way on, way on. (Laughs) I didn   t know nothing about no married way  back then. Someone talked about my birth certificate. I didn   t know  what that was. They had what you called midwives. They didn   t know  nothing about no birth certificate. I didn   t know what a birth certificate  was. Way on, way on down doctors   I got two or three children, I  think, I had doctors with. Otherwise we had them   an old lady you  called would take care of them, the pregnant women, when they had the  babies. They called them midwives. They had the babies at home,  didn   t know what the hospital was made for.  Finchum How many babies did you have?  Munn Ten. (Laughs)  Finchum Ten?  Munn I had a miscarriage with one. I had nine living children. That seems  crazy now.  Finchum Rattle off their names for me.  Munn Rattle off their names? Ruby, Daisy, Shirley, Silvia (that   s that one  there), Anthony, Milton, Willie. I guess that probably it. Anthony,  Willie     Tisdale Missed one. That was Sonny.  Munn Huh?  Tisdale You just missed one and that was Sonny.  Munn Sonny, yeah. I   ve named them. I said Sonny, Daisy, Ruby, Shirley,  Silvia, Anthony, Milton. I said Milton.  Tisdale You missed Willie this time.  Munn Willie.  Finchum Then one more?  Munn  Leonard . That   s it.  Finchum That   s a lot to keep up with. I   m not going to ask you their birthdates.  12  Munn Don   t ask me. I might have forgotten mine. (Laughter) I can kind of  remember the year, I mean the month. That is about it. Yours  (Shirley   s) was in July. Milton   s was in November.  Bishop That   s a large family. What types of things did you do with that many  kids?  Munn What did I do with them? They picked cotton. We took them to the  cotton patch. They picked cotton, chopped cotton. They picked cotton  for the money now. They   d take money and buy their school clothes  and things like that. Way on, way on down, he, my husband, had a job  here in Lawton. When he had to work in Lawton, we were still out there  in the cotton patch helping support the family. We had the children in  our family out there picking cotton, and they   d still buy their clothes.  We made it, we made it. He had a job here in Lawton.  Bishop What were holidays like in your family?  Munn Holidays was really good. We enjoyed it. Like Christmas, they didn   t  get nothing. They didn   t get no bicycle. They didn   t get no motorcycle,  nothing like that, but what they got, they was happy. We   d hardly get  nothing but some fruit. They got some fruit and some candy, little bit,  but they were happy. They didn   t get very many toys.  Tisdale We got fruit, apples and oranges. We got nuts. We got a couple of toys  a piece. I did finally get a bicycle when I was in the sixth grade.  Munn We were happy though. More happy than these folks now. You can buy  them a motorcycle now a day and they   re not happy, these children.  They won   t ask for a bicycle, they will ask for a car. (Laughs) Now.  I   ve got a lot of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I   ve had some  of them, great-grands. They weren   t like mine. Mine didn   t ask for  nothing, but these great-grand ones they   ll ask for a car.  Finchum Well, they won   t get it will they?  Munn No, they won   t get it, but I had a good life. We enjoyed it. I did.  Finchum Was church an important part of it?  Munn Out there in the cotton patch, we didn   t have no church. We just picked  cotton. (Laughs)  Bishop Has church been an important part of your life growing up?  13  Munn Yeah. After we quit, come out of the cotton patch and come to Lawton,  well it   s been a part of my life. Well before too, when I was down there  east of Duncan. We had a church down there, too. The church has been  a part of my life.  Finchum Did you sing in the choir?  Munn I sure did. I sung good too  (Laughter) I hope. Yes, I sung in the choir. I  sung in the choir.  Finchum Did you have a favorite song?  Munn Well, no. I like    Jesus Keep Me Near the Cross.    I worked with the  children, the little ones. I like to work with them little bitty ones. When  they got bigger, well, I didn   t want them much. They   d talk about boys,  but them little ones was real sweet to work with.  Tisdale How long did you teach Sunday school? Was it what, forty-six years?  Munn Huh?  Tisdale How long did you teach Sunday school?  Munn I think it was twenty-five, thirty years altogether, working with the  children and the choir and all that.  Finchum Had some patience     Munn Yeah, you had to have patience, had to have patience.  Finchum How would you do discipline?  Munn I   d just tell them to set down, and they obeyed pretty good. Those little  ones would. I had more trouble with them teenagers, thirteen and on up.  Finchum Well, how did you discipline your own children?  Munn Oh my own children? I didn   t have no problems out of them. They was  pretty good children. They worked there. Them boys, when they come  to Lawton from the cotton patch they worked too. They shined shoes.  Worked for Fort Sill. And the girls, I didn   t have no problems with  them. They were very nice children, if I do have to say it myself.  (Laughter)  Finchum Go right ahead   14  Munn I didn   t have no problem with them hardly. Those little boys, they   d  work. They worked and helped buy their clothes, school clothes.  Finchum They could spend what they earned?  Munn Yeah, we let them have what they earned. Yeah, when they come to  Lawton and they shined shoes, why they could spend what they earned.  When we was all working together in the cotton patch, well we had to  take that money and that would buy them some clothes, school clothes.  But they   d spend what they earned when they got to Lawton.  Tisdale I think they were shining boots and it was like twenty-five cents a pair.  They would walk from here to Fort Sill. They   d shine shoes out there  all day.  Bishop You were married at one time, right?  Tisdale We all come up with our dad.  Bishop How did you meet your husband?  Munn That   s a good question. I met him at the church I guess.  Tisdale Down in the country?  Munn That   s passed my mind. (Laughter) How I met him, I can   t remember  that one. That   s a funny thing to me, and I can   t even remember the  year I married. I guess I wanted to blot it out I guess, because I can   t  remember that one. I sure can   t. That should be easy, but it wasn   t. I  guess I didn   t want to marry. I can   t remember.  Tisdale You had ten children, so you must have wanted to be married. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, did your brothers and sisters stay around this area too?  Munn Some of them.  Finchum Some of them.  Munn Some of them did and some went on off to California.  Tisdale She said your brothers and sisters.  Munn Oh my brother and sister. Yeah, they stayed around here. My sisters all  stayed around here, sure did and I   m the last one of them.  15  Finchum Are you the only one of them left?  Munn Only one of them living.  Finchum Are you the first to make it to a hundred?  Munn Yeah.  Finchum Out of the bunch?  Munn Yeah.  Bishop Did you ever think you would make it to a hundred?  Munn No, huh-uh. I wonder. Sometimes I wonder why the Lord leave me  here, but he has a reason. He has a reason for leaving me here. I guess  to talk with some of them and tell them to get right. I guess. I don   t  know. I guess I shouldn   t question, but I   m the only one out of the  whole big bunch of them.  Finchum Well, did they get close to a hundred? Did some of them?  Munn Yeah.  Finchum Live to be in their nineties, eighties? Nineties?  Munn Yeah, my sisters did. I had, I think, two sisters that got close to ninety.  Tisdale I think one was ninety-nine, Aunt Maudie was ninety-nine. Aunt Ottie  was ninety-two.  Munn I had two  sisters  get close  to a hundred .  Finchum Well, what is your secret to staying here this long?  Munn Like I told some of them, my secret I guess is love first, loving Jesus. I  love him. I am a big fan of Christ. I would say a big fan. I think that   s  my secret. Then, people. I love people. All people, not just one. I love  ugly ones, poor ones, black ones, white ones, yellow ones, all people. I  love them. I think that   s my secret, and doing right. I learned a scripture  in the Bible where it said,    Do unto all men as you would have them do  unto you.    I   ve tried to do that. I guess that is one of my secrets is doing  right. Treating people, and loving people, and always loving God. Then,  you can   t love people unless you love God, and so I do. I love people. I  like to be with, I like to work with people. I   ve been working with them  16  ever since I   ve been working. When I started working, I worked with  people and I like to. I liked that.  Finchum What type of work did you do once you got married? Besides the cotton  field, what else did you do?  Munn Well, I was what you call a housekeeper at Comanche Memorial  Hospital, and I went to the airport right from there. I worked there, and I  worked in people   s homes. I took care of some children. Well, I took  care of the house, like washing the clothes and cooking for them, and  taking care of the little boys. I   d like to see them little boys now.  (Laughs) They   d be grown though now. That   s about what I did.  Worked at Fort Sill, worked at Memorial Hospital, worked at the  airport, and in people   s homes taking care of the children.  Finchum You stayed busy.  Munn Yeah, I stayed busy. I worked.  Tisdale You always forget your favorite one, and that was working on the  Election Board. You always enjoyed that.  Munn The voting place?  Tisdale Yes.  Munn Yeah, the  Election  Board. Put your name down if you going to vote. I  worked there until, I think that was about my last job, wasn   t it?  Tisdale It was your last job. I think you did that for almost twenty years.  Munn Yeah, I did that for a while.  Finchum Did some people try to vote twice?  Munn Not to my knowledge. Some people didn   t want to vote. I said,    You  need to vote. That   s your right.     Bishop What were some of the things you did on the Election Board? What  were some of your duties or tasks?  Munn I just counted the votes.  Bishop How did you get involved?  17  Munn How did I happen to get involved? I don   t know. Well I guess one  thing, we lived out here and we didn   t have nobody out here working  like that. Now that   s right here in Lawton.  Tisdale In this area.  Munn I said,    Well we need somebody working. We need a helper, somebody  to work in that place.    I just took it on myself. I said,    I   m going to  bring people in here to work like this.    They worked for the Election  Board. I said,    I want to do it. I believe there should be somebody out  here that can do that.    That   s the way I got started. I wanted to do it. I  wanted to help work out here and so that is what I did. I got involved  like that. I worked like that until they closed that down. No, they didn   t  close it. Yeah, they closed it down. They don   t work no more like that  out here, do they?  Tisdale Oh they still do. We vote at the Multipurpose Center now. When you  were doing it, they  voted  at the church.  Munn I worked at the church, and they really had no place to vote. No house  or no voting place so they had it in the church houses until  Multipurpose came down here. I worked a little bit down there.  Finchum Do you keep up with politics today?  Munn Huh?  Finchum Do you keep up with politics today?  Munn Yeah, I sure do.  Finchum You do?  Munn Yeah. I know exactly who   s running and who   s not. I know Bush and I  know Jeb Bush.  Finchum Hillary?  Munn Huh?  Finchum Hillary? Hillary Clinton?  Munn Oh yeah, Clinton, Mrs. Clinton.  Finchum She did what?  18  Munn She   s running for president. I think she   s going to run. Mrs. Clinton     Finchum Well, how did you celebrate your birthday, one hundredth birthday?  Munn Oh, they had a great big time. (Laughs) They had rented a place down  there. I had about a hundred, two hundred people I guess. They carried  me down there. They took pictures. They gave me some food and all  that kind of stuff. (Laughs) I enjoyed the people coming in. I got more  hugs than I ever gotten in my life.  Finchum Happy day, huh?  Munn Happy birthday.  Finchum Happy birthday.  Munn I said,    Woo-e. Never would have thought I   d have gotten a hundred.        You   re a hundred     No, I wouldn   t have thought that  I wouldn   t have  thought that.  Finchum Aiming for a hundred and ten?  Munn No, I don   t want that. I got enough of it now I think.  Bishop What is your biggest challenge at hundred?  Munn My biggest challenge? Like what do you mean? What I want or what  you     Bishop What is the biggest challenge that you have at a hundred? Physically,  whatever it may be?  Finchum What can   t you do that you wish you could?  Bishop Yeah.  Munn Nothing. Challenge?  Tisdale Yeah, what do you want to do now that you used to do?  Munn I can   t think of nothing. I think I   ve, like I said, I   ve enjoyed what I   ve  done.  Tisdale I think you are still missing the point of the question.  Munn Do what?  19  Tisdale Is there something that you wish you could do now that you can   t do?  Munn No, nothing.  Tisdale You don   t want to walk?  Munn No.  Tisdale Oh yeah...you wouldn   t?  Munn No.  Finchum When did you give up driving?  Munn It   s been several years back. I guess twelve, thirteen years.  Tisdale No, it hasn   t been that long.  Munn Been that long?  Tisdale Your license was expired a couple years ago. Then, you know, when I  took her to get her license, I think she was in her nineties. You know  they didn   t ask her. They just took her back there and took her picture  and gave it to her. They didn   t test nothing. I   m going like, what?  Bishop That   s how they do it now. They don   t care.  Munn Challenge? I don   t know nothing.  Finchum You hear pretty well?  Munn Huh?  Finchum You hear pretty well?  Munn No, I can   t hear well. I can see better than I can hear.  Bishop Keep a watch.  Tisdale She has a sharp eye. She doesn   t miss nothing.  Bishop What is a typical day like for you? What time do you get up? Are there  certain things you do?  20  Munn We get up about eight thirty. I don   t do anything, but get up and sit  down. I go from chair to chair. From this chair to a wheelchair, and look  at TV. I have some things I like to look at, the church business. That   s  about it.  Bishop Do you do any reading?  Munn No, I never did like to read. No, I don   t like to read. I never did read too  much. The Bible, I read that. If I have to go back to something, I would  go back to the children at the church. I enjoy them. I did that until I  couldn   t. I   d work with the children. Otherwise, I   m satisfied with     Finchum Do you help cook?  Munn No ma   am.  Finchum No?  Munn I don   t cook at all. Not at all.  Finchum By choice?  Munn Hmm     Finchum Do you choose not to cook?  Munn Well, I can   t.  Finchum You can   t.  Munn Well, sometimes I have them bring me things and put it on the table like  peeling potatoes and things like that. I might do that. I can   t. That is  about the only thing I   d do.  Finchum Well, when you did cook, what did your children like the best?  Munn I don   t think they had no favorite. Whatever I cooked I believe. I don   t  think they had no favorite.  Bishop What was the favorite thing that your mother cooked that you liked?  Munn I like cornbread she cooked. I still yet like it. She cooked, she made  biscuits from scratch. I liked the great big old biscuits. (Laughs) I liked  to eat them with syrup.  21  Tisdale Tell them how you used to make syrup. I remember this too. When we  couldn   t buy syrup, you   d make syrup. Tell her how you made syrup.  Bishop How did you make syrup?  Tisdale When we couldn   t buy syrup?  Munn When the cane, you know that?  We  raised that cane you know.  We   take and mash the juice out of it and cook it and make molasses. But  you   re talking about sugar syrup.  We  took the sugar and put some  water in it and boil it. That   d be your  sugar  syrup.  Finchum On a hot biscuit it would be good.  Tisdale It was good   Munn It is good. Yeah, it   s good. Oh boy  Yep.  Bishop When history is written, what would you like it to say about you? How  would you like to be remembered?  Munn I would like to be remembered just like history.
