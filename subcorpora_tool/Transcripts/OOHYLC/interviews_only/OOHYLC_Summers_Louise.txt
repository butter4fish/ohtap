He wanted the person,  whoever was waiting on him, to go and get one thing, and then he  would read you another one.

As far as I remember, various companies  had representatives that came to you and got your list of what you  needed, and ordered, and you paid for it.  19  Finchum You had to have a budget then.  L. Summers Yes.  Finchum Well, was religion an important part of your life?  L. Summers Oh yes.  Finchum Even as a youngster?  L. Summers Yes, even when. There was always a baby in the family.

Finchum What do you do between lunch and bedtime?  L. Summers You   re a housewife, aren   t you?  Finchum No.  L. Summers You   re not? (Laughs)  Finchum There   s always something to do, I know. Do you read?  L. Summers Some. I   ve always had weak eyes, so I can   t read any length of at a  time.  Finchum Watch television?  30  L. Summers Uh-huh.  Finchum Do you keep up with what   s going on through the newspaper or through  the TV?  L. Summers I get the Tulsa Daily World in the morning. I watch TV more when I   m  eating my lunch or in the evening.  Finchum Have a favorite show?  L. Summers Yes, Wheel of Fortune. (Laughs)  Finchum Okay. That was my mother   s, so I understand. That and Lawrence  Welk.  L. Summers Oh yes, Lawrence Welk. Some of his older shows are on TV.  Bishop Did you ever meet Will Rogers?  L. Summers Uh-huh.  Bishop Tell us about that.  L. Summers He was just a person. You didn   t realize when you were younger that he  was so important. He was just another person.  K. Summers Where did you meet him? Did you meet him at the grocery store or just  around town?  L. Summers Meet who hon?  K. Summers Will Rogers.  L. Summers I don   t    remember a first time. You didn   t realize that he was an  important person. He wasn   t when he was growing up. He was witty. I  remember he was witty.  Finchum Is there anything on your bucket list that you still want to do?  L. Summers I wish I could walk where I wouldn   t need my walker. That   s my wish  in life, but that   s not going to happen. See, I   ve had both hips replaced,  from falls.  Finchum How old were you when you had that done?  L. Summers That   s just in the last ten or fifteen years.  31  Finchum You were in your eighties?  L. Summers Yeah. I would have to be.  Finchum That   s pretty good. They don   t do hip replacements on a lot of people  that age, so you were in good shape for them to do that.  L. Summers Yeah, well thank you.  Finchum Any place that you want to go, that you haven   t been?  L. Summers Most people say Hawaii, but that doesn   t come to my mind. I would  like to travel. At one time, my sister that   s younger than I, she, we  would take short trips.  Finchum Well, where would you want to go?  L. Summers Where would I want to go?  Finchum Uh-huh.  L. Summers I don   t think of any specific place. I would just like to take short travels  here and there to see the country, see the state.  Finchum Go down to Talihina Drive?  L. Summers Yes, of course that   s something you do.  Finchum They say it   s pretty. I haven   t done it.  L. Summers Well, it   s one of those wonders.  Finchum So, you are pretty set on where you are then?  L. Summers Yes.  Finchum What did you do for your birthday, your last birthday?  L. Summers Let me think. Well, usually the church has a tea. Then, family just come  and goes. Yeah.  Finchum Lots of cake and cards.  L. Summers Yes.  32  Finchum And there will be noodles next time.  K. Summers There better be. Special request. (Laughter)  L. Summers I   ll fix you some chicken and noodles one of these days. You mean that  Marilyn hasn   t had it?  K. Summers No.  L. Summers I think that used to be Bob   s, kind of one of his favorites.  K. Summers We always requested the mac and cheese.  L. Summers Yes.  Finchum Homemade macaroni and cheese.  L. Summers Yes, I still like that.  Finchum Do you have any questions you want to ask her?  K. Summers I think we kind of hit every point. Mother was telling me that your mom  was actually Catholic?  L. Summers She was reared Catholic.  K. Summers Very Catholic, so how did you get to the Methodist church?  L. Summers That was through my dad.  K. Summers It was just he was Methodist?  L. Summers Yeah, well when we came to Oklahoma at Sperry the only church there  was, I can   t think of it. I   ll think of it later. It is like Baptist or  Methodist, but we would laugh and say that Momma would still make  her chicken and noodles and go to the evening get-togethers. (Laughs)  K. Summers So you were baptized Methodist?  L. Summers Uh-huh. Oh let me tell you about my baptism. (Laughs) Of course you  baptized in the creek. You didn   t have a baptismal or anything.  Anyway, Momma thought you had to have a white dress on. She got  some unbleached muslin. Do you know what that is?  Finchum I do.  33  L. Summers Okay, well, I had on   it had a full skirt. Whenever they put me  backwards to baptize me, here comes this unbleached muslin skirt and  covered my face. (Laughs) It had so much starch in it you know, it  didn   t take the water. (Laughs)  Finchum I   m just surprised there was enough water to do it in the creek.  L. Summers We lived between what they called two creeks. One was Hominy and  one was Bird Creek. We were close to the Hominy.  Finchum How young would you have been when you were baptized?  L. Summers Fourteen.  Finchum So that   s why the memory is so     L. Summers Uh-huh. I tell you, that unbleached muslin came over my face. (Laughs)  K. Summers So what about your wedding dress? Did you have to make that yourself  or     L. Summers What was it hon?  K. Summers Your wedding dress     L. Summers My wedding dress, no.  K. Summers You buy it?  L. Summers You got married in what you had. Some time ago, Tom found a  newspaper describing the wedding, and I had on a blue dress, because  that was my best wear. He said,    Well why no white?    I said,    Well,  you couldn   t afford a white one then.    You wore what you had. My  wedding dress was a blue dress I had. (Laughs)  Finchum And did you get married at church or at home?  L. Summers At church.  Finchum Did you have a honeymoon?  L. Summers Not really.  Finchum Not really. There wasn   t money for one then, if it was the early    30s.  L. Summers No.  34  Bishop When history is written, what would you like it to say about you? How  do you want to be remembered?  L. Summers Happy. Was that too quick an answer? (Laughter)  Bishop Do you have a motto or piece of advice you could give people who want  to live a long time?  L. Summers Enjoy every day. Even when things go wrong, you have to think at the  end of the day,    Well that wasn   t so bad.     Bishop That   s good.  Finchum What makes you happy?  L. Summers I guess, just because I know people love me.  Finchum That   s a good answer. Well, do you hum or sing to yourself or anything  like that?  L. Summers I used to sing a lot, really, at church and solos. I have bronchitis so  much that it just takes your voice.  Finchum Have you heard her sing?  K. Summers I have not.  L. Summers I can   t sing anymore. I doubt if I could get tenor, or soprano rather, over  a b+.  Finchum You could carry a tune a little bit?  L. Summers Oh yes.  Finchum Hum or whistle then.  L. Summers I hum. (Laughter)  K. Summers Do you have a favorite song throughout all the years?  L. Summers What comes to mind,    I come to the garden alone       (Singing)  Finchum    where the dew is still on the roses    That   s a good one. I know that  one. I can   t do my math, but I know that one. (Laughter) Well living  35  independent, do you take care of all your bills and stuff today or do you  have a little help?  L. Summers I did until just about six months ago.  Finchum Still doing your math then?  L. Summers Yeah. Barbara does most of it now.  Finchum Do you still drive?  L. Summers Oh no. I sold my car when I was ninety. Traffic was getting quite busy  here in Claremore, and I was afraid I might hurt somebody, so I just  quit.  Finchum You made a decision yourself and did it.  L. Summers Uh-huh.  Finchum That   s impressive. How would you get around town in the last ten years  then?  L. Summers Friends, and sometimes family.  Finchum I guess we should back up. When did you lose your husband?  L. Summers Let   s see, I moved in    73, here. Must have been    71.  Finchum It   s been awhile. You have a good independent streak. Not afraid to be  by yourself.  L. Summers I make sure the doors are locked. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s good.  Bishop How important are those friends that take care of you?  L. Summers Now? You see as I get older, my friends get older. They are in a  position where they   re limited in what they can do.  Finchum It   s nice to have a great-granddaughter around, isn   t it?  L. Summers Yes.  Finchum She makes you happy.  36  L. Summers Yes.  Finchum Anything you want to add before we close?  L. Summers No, I think you covered more than I thought you would.  Finchum You   ve been great.  L. Summers Well, thank you.  Finchum You might think of something else you want to add. No? All right, I will  say thank you for sharing with us today.  L. Summers Well     Finchum It   s been a pleasure.  L. Summers It   s all because of her, of what it means to her.  K. Summers She said she would not do it unless it was worth a grade. (Laughter) Her  specific words. Thank you.  -------  -------
