 Finchum Today is October 2, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Clinton, Oklahoma, to speak with Raymond Riley. This is part of our  Oklahoma 100 Year of Life project, so thank you for talking with us.  Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Riley I was born in San Antonio, Texas.  Finchum And when?  Riley Ninth of September, 1915.  Finchum So you recently turned one-hundred?  Riley Yes.  Finchum How did you celebrate?  Riley They threw a party for me here and that was it.  Finchum Okay, blow out a lot of candles?  Riley Yeah.  Finchum So did you have brothers and sisters?  Riley I have a half-brother who lives in California. He   s a retired naval  officer. His rank was a commander. I don   t know exactly where that  rank is, but it   s not an enlisted man. It   s an officer   s. He lives in  California, half-brother.  5  Finchum So what did your parents do for a living?  Riley My parents? They adopted me, you know.  Finchum Okay.  Riley My mother was born in San Antonio. My mother, real mother, brought  me to Oklahoma City and put me on a doorstep. I told you this before,  which was very fortunate for me with the people that became my  adopted parents. However back in those days there were no strict  adopting laws like there is now. They raised me and that   s it. They  taught me their values and everything. They were a fine couple.  Finchum About how old were you when that happened?  Riley Three.  Finchum So you   ve been in Oklahoma since about that time? Other than when  you were  in the military ?  Riley When World War II caught me I started going places. Then when I  come back from World War II I was a reserve, which I continually got  recalled. That   s about it.  Finchum Where did you go to school?  Riley I went to the best college in the world, in my opinion, in England.  What   s the name of it? Not Harvard, not Yale     Bishop There   s Cambridge, there   s Oxford. Are you talking England?  Riley In England, yeah.  Bishop Like Cambridge, or Oxford, or     Riley Oxford, yes. I went there. They gave me a   what do they call those  entrance examinations?  Bishop Oh, the entrance exam?  Riley Yeah, and I did pretty well in it. I guess I aced it. So I studied  mathematics there at Oxford   mathematics and that   s about it. I was  a   I became a meteorologist after I came back from World War II.  Pretty interesting life. I did so well that they used me as a  troubleshooter. They sent me all over the world. I even went to Buenos  Aires, Argentina, and down on the Horn, you know. I took a   they sent  6  me down there. They sent me to Cape Canaveral first, and I picked up  some equipment that an airline used to measure the clouds and to track  the satellite. I became an expert in that. I probably knew more than     everybody thought I knew more, but actually I knew how little I knew.  I became a   I tracked the satellite, one of the satellites, you know. They  come over every twenty-four hours, and I   d catch it when it came in our  range. It would transmit data to me   the clouds and everything that was  going on. I became an expert at that. They sent me to Buenos Aires, as I  said, and put me on an airplane with a crew, three men, youngsters, all  of my crew, and all the other men   youngsters. We went down there to  teach them how to   and took a satellite tracking unit down there, teach  them how to use it. Spent a couple of months down there. They treated  me like a king, boy.  I   m continually surprised about the change and attitude towards the men  and women. By the way it   s changed, you know. In foreign countries,  especially Sweden, England and anywhere in Europe on the continent,  there were things pretty loose, you know? It wasn   t that way in the  States, but it is now. I mean it   s getting that way. In Buenos Aires they  really treated me like a king.  Finchum About what year was that when you went there,    40s or    50s or     Riley In    73. Wait a minute, I think    73.  Finchum When you say    they    I   m assuming that   s the military? When you say     they    sent you there, is that the military?  Riley No, the whole country, the ambassador from the United States and  everybody. I   m having trouble remembering now, I   m sorry.  Bishop Let   s back up a bit. Tell us a little bit about your military service. What  branch of the service were you in?  Riley Air Force. It was created in 19   I don   t know. Wasn   t the Air Force     was then United States Army Air Corps, you know. Then the Air Force  became a separate branch, and they took me because I   d spent most of  my life in airplanes anyway.  Bishop And what was your rank?  Riley Master sergeant. They finally created   when I was a master sergeant  that was the highest rank, but they finally created a couple higher. I  watched people get promoted who   I outclassed them. Some of them  were my friends. I would outrank them in longitude or angle, so I went  7  to the general, can   t remember his name, he happened to be visiting the  base. I took that opportunity to complain. (Laughs) He said,    Sergeant  Riley, there   s some things you need to understand. First, you   re a pretty  old guy, and these guys we   re promoting got what we need. Potential.  (Laughs) Secondly, you already make more money than even I do.     They give you wine and stuff like that, you know. Boy, I was quieter  than a Jag.  Bishop What wars did you serve in?  Riley Was in many of them.  Bishop World War II?  Riley Yes.  Bishop Korea?  Riley Yes.  Bishop Vietnam?  Riley Yes.  Bishop You   re     Riley Is that all of them?  Bishop Yeah, you were pretty old in Vietnam...  Riley Oh yeah   Bishop    for an officer. I mean for military service.  Riley I was beyond fifty. I think I was fifty-one, maybe older.  Bishop So how long did you serve in each war?  Riley Spent fifteen months in Vietnam. And Europe, I spent eight years of my  life in England. However, thirty months during World War II, back,  then I went to England again, in peace time, and took my wife and my  youngest daughter with me. My youngest daughter graduated from high  School near Burns Flat  Oklahoma . You know where that is, but she  graduated from   she went to school. My family has always been  interested in horses. My daughter that was with me in England, the  8  second trip, was quite a rider, boy. She rode in the races, the jumping,  and what they done, she done. She was real good.  Bishop Like equestrian riding?  Riley Yes, she was good. My oldest daughter was pretty good too, and her  husband raises paint horses.  Bishop Oh, paint horses.  Riley They were good. I   ve seen my oldest daughter who   s in   she   s in her  seventies now you know, but I   ve seen her on horseback. It just made  me proud. The Paint Horse Association bought her a trailer and put her  horse in that and then sent her around. They even sent it to Australia, in  a horse show in Australia.  Bishop When you got married how old were you? Or when did you get  married?  Riley Twenty.  Bishop And how  about  your meet your wife?  Riley Eighteen.  Bishop How did you meet your wife?  Riley She moved right next door to me when I was still living with my  adopted parents, and we lived next door to them. I had a date with her  sister, but the date was not what either of us wanted. (Laughter) The  next date was with Dean, Maxine, I nicknamed her Dean. She made a  wonderful wife. She could survive without me, you know. She could  take care of my finances and everything. She   s quite a gal.  Bishop What year were you married?  Riley  In  1936   wait a minute   1936.  Finchum During the Depression.  Riley Oh yes, but the Depression was not for me. There was many, many  people out of a job you know, but I didn   t have any trouble. When I got  married my dad told me,    Raymond, you can   t even take care of  yourself. How are you going to take care of a wife?    That upset me  some. We got married, moved into an apartment house in Oklahoma  City, and lived there a while. I drove   I didn   t have a job when I got  9  married, but I had to go to work. Somehow I had to support us. So I  drove a taxicab. I did that for thirty-six hours, until I quit from fatigue,  boy. The guy with the taxicab company said,    Okay, here   s your cab  full of gas. When you bring it back, have it full of gas.    I asked him, I  said,    There   s a nice car, a four-door Plymouth, a nice car. How come  you picked me?    All those guys lined up waiting for a cab, you know? I  said,    They   re all experienced drivers, you picked me.    He said,    I  know. You   re a lot easier and more fair to the car than anybody else.     So I drove it until I got tired, but I never went back. Only worked there  briefly. I did this and I done that. Got tired of one job   that was during  the Depression days, you know? I   m continually looking for a better  job. The lady said,    Can you cook?    I said,    Yes.    She put me in the  kitchen. Wasn   t long before she said,    Riley, you can   t cook  (Laughs)  Maybe you can run the cash register.    So I did.  Bishop Was that in Oklahoma City?  Riley Yes.  Finchum So you went to high school in Oklahoma City?  Riley Yes.  Finchum Which one?  Riley All of them. The one in Capitol Hill. I even went there for a very short  period of time. There   s one   Classen High School, went there. My  initial school was Central High School. I don   t know what they do now  at that building. Do you know?  Finchum So what year did you graduate?  Riley I never graduated from anything.  Finchum You didn   t finish high school?  Riley No, I didn   t finish high school. I was very much at odds with the  educational system. As I say, I quit school, but I am well educated. I got  educated. Like I say, I studied mathematics. I studied many other  things.  Bishop That was through the military in Oxford? Was that for Army-Air Corps  training in war time? When you studied math   when you studied math  at Oxford in England, was that in the wartime, in terms of training?  10  Riley Yes. They used different standards to give   it was entrance  examinations you know. I aced that. I took one at   oh well. I have an  education, but I got here and there you know.  Bishop Through training.  Riley I have been at odds with our education system, anyway. I don   t think  it   s very good. England is much better. They separate the classes. If  you   re medium-smart you go to one school. If you   re quite a bit of an  intellect you go to another school. It   s much better.  Bishop Going back to your childhood, you said you were adopted. Did you ever  meet your mother ever again or see her again?  Riley Yes. I don   t know the details, how my adopted parents were acquainted  with my real mother. I met her a couple of times. I met her when she     before when she was   A doctor said,    Mr. Riley, I don   t how old she  is, except she   s well over a hundred.    That   s all I remember. She didn   t  even know me. So I went down there, I buried her and paid for her  burial in San Antonio. I had an aunt, her younger, much younger  even   it   s hard to believe, about my age or a little older, was my aunt  biologically. We met a lot of people down there on my mother   s side.  Some of them were remarkable people. One guy, can   t remember his  name, but he owned a   he was a taxidermist. He had a huge building,  big, full of stuff that he had stuffed. He operated that for six months a  year. The other six months he was a bush pilot in Alaska. He was quite  a guy.  Finchum Is Riley your biological mother   s last name?  Riley No.  Finchum You   re adopted parents?  Riley Adopted parents. Her name was Ojetti.  Bishop Ojetti.  Finchum Ojetti.  Bishop Ojetti.  Riley I saw her just before she died, when I went down there and bought her  funeral and everything.  Finchum Had you seen her before that?  11  Riley Yes, after I got married in 1936. Must   ve been about    38,    39,  somewhere in there. My adopted parents came to me and told me,     Your mother is going to be in a circus showing in Oklahoma.    I don   t  know how they knew that   how my adopted parents knew that. I asked  Pat, my father, I said    I want to borrow your car. I   m going to drive to  Shawnee to see the circus.    I took my wife, I had a wife, took her with  me. She was in the circus and also the sideshow. That   s it.  Finchum Did you get to talk to her?  Riley Yeah, I don   t remember what I said or what she said.  Finchum Do you remember the name of the circus?  Riley Barnes and Bailey. I guess the biggest circus there is. I think they were  stationed in Hugo, Oklahoma. What else?  Bishop Do you have any stories you remember from World War II?  Riley Oh, I could tell you stories  Everything was always happening to me.  Bishop Like what?  Riley I think I told you this before, when I missed the train in Manchester,  England. Didn   t I tell you about that?  Bishop I think you started to, but what     Riley I missed the train. It was after midnight, so I   m walking down the street  and thought,    What will I do?    The Red Cross had a Red Cross  whatever you call them there and cots for overnight, for people. I  already knew they were full. I went back to them. They said,    No Riley,  we don   t even have a mattress for you. We   re full.    GIs, you know.  That was during war time. So I walked down the street. I thought,     Well, there   s one answer     (Laughs) Sure enough, a nice looking gal,  there wasn   t anything going on in the streets. It was just after midnight.  One gal came walking down the street, good looking woman. I thought,     Well, (it was a prostitute) that   s my answer.    She said,    I   m not a  prostitute,    but she said,    I   ll take care of you.    She said,    We   re  going       You   ve heard this story.  Bishop Up to this, where   d you go?  Riley She said,    We   re going to a railroad station to catch a train. I   ll take you  home.    I said,    No, trains don   t run after midnight. There are no more  12  trains.    She said,    We   re going to the Regional Railroad station in the  other part of town. It goes in a different direction, and it takes me to my  home, which is on the Thames River,    flowing through. I said,    Well.     We went to the station in another part of Manchester. We couldn   t get  on  The train was loaded with people going that direction, but she didn   t  care. She kind of grabbed me by the hand, and she led me up to the  engine   steam engine. The fireman or the engineer, I don   t know  which, said they were expecting her. They said,    We didn   t know  you         they put me in a coal car, both of us, and took us to her house,  got off the train at her house, at her station.  Then I spent the night with her, quite a night there. She had a fireplace  in her little apartment. A knock on the front door. (Laughs). That was  her father with a case of beer. (Laughs)    Here.    So we drank beer, made  love in front the fire. The transom over the back door fell in. A guy fell  through it. She said,    That   s my taxicab driver,    the guy that had  brought us out there, so we chased him away. It cut him up a little. Kind  of funny, you know. Got up the next morning. She told me where to  catch the train. I had to go back to Manchester, you know. My life was  just full of adventures all of the time.  Bishop Did you ever see action during World War II?  Riley Oh yes, from the air.  Bishop From the air?  Riley I didn   t do much ground fighting. I did in Vietnam  I got shot at all over  the place in Vietnam. During World War II my activity was different,  you know. I got a lot of experience. One time I came in, I picked up an  airplane me and my three-man crew were going to install a new engine  in. The engine wasn   t running. It was a four-engine cargo plane, and I  picked it up at the head of the runway. I asked the tower. I said,    I need  to taxi down the runway, if you   ll let me, to the other end of where I  want to get off of the airplane and work  on it .    They gave me  permission. So I start out down there on the runway and got about  halfway down and they said,    Sergeant Riley, get that airplane off the  runway     I said,    No. Nothing out there but mud     They said,    We   re  telling you to get that airplane off the runway. We   ve got an  emergency.    So I did. (Laughs) Taxied it out there and got stuck in the  mud. All kinds of stuff. Oh, I know I told you about this one, but I  taxied the four-engine cargo plane down Douglas Boulevard. I told you  about that one.  Bishop I don   t remember that one.  13  Riley I think it was an airplane   I   m not sure whether it was a  Pacusan   Dreamboat or not. I think it was   it might   ve been the reserves to take  the Dreamboat   s place, to fly around the world, polarized. They got rid  of the attached wings of that particular airplane. They   re made of  rubber. That airplane had   I don   t think they were leaking, but the  company that manufactured those for the Air Force was on Douglas  Boulevard. I got in the airplane, wouldn   t let my crew in there or  anybody, just all by myself. I notified a highway patrol and they  blocked the traffic going both ways. I taxied it down Boulevard,  Douglas Boulevard, to the company to work on it, to get rid of our gas  tanks in the wings. When they got through I had my crew bring up a tug  and I towed it back.  Laughter   Finchum How did you learn how to fly?  Riley How did I learn how to fly? When I come back from World War II     no, before World War II. When was that? Early, it was before World  War II, yeah, I was pretty young. I hadn   t been to war. I lived on the  east side of Oklahoma City and owned a house over there. How did I     oh, let   s see   somehow I applied for pilot training and got it, and took  my training at Tulakes,  later known as  Wiley Post Airport.  Finchum Wiley Post?  Bishop Wiley Post.  Riley Excuse me. I   d drive over there every day, had wonderful training. It  was in a Piper Cub, but I flew Cessnas and all kinds of single-engine  airplanes. Got my license, I have a commercial license for single-engine  airplanes. Any single-engine airplane. I could actually fly anything I  think. So much for that.  Finchum Did you ever have to jump out of one?  Riley No, but I have booted people out. (Laughter) Paratroopers you know,  take them up in the airplane. I had a cousin that I liked real well. He and  I were good friends, and he was a paratrooper. He jumped out of an  airplane, he went up in the airplane eight times. The last, I don   t know,  last, I guess it might   ve been the last time, he jumped out in enemy  territory, you know, during the war. I took him up for the first time he  ever landed in an airplane. (Laughs) I was next to him. He thought I  was quite a pilot, boy  I flew a Piper Cub, flew a side-by-side. A Piper  Cub was this way. (Gestures) I   d do all kinds of tricks with it   was  pretty good  I did a lot of them tailspins, you know.  Finchum Did you do a loop-de-loop?  14  Riley Yeah, it   s a wonder I hadn   t got killed, I   ve done so many of them.  There was a thing called an Immelmann turn. The Germans used it. To  do a loop, and then at the top of the loop you turn over. It   s a very rough  maneuver. It takes know-how to do it. I could handle that no problem.  (Laughter) I could handle it all. I delighted in tailspins.  Bishop It sounds like you   re a little bit of a risk-taker.  Riley I   ve been a rule-breaker all my life, still am. The thing of it is, I always  broke rules when they should be broken, if you know what I mean. I  told you this before, I stole a truckload of mattresses in Vietnam.  Bishop You didn   t tell me that one.  Riley Yeah, I told you   Bishop No, not that one.  Riley Anyway     Finchum Tell me.  Bishop Tell her.  Riley At that point in time I   m a meteorologist. I made a good one, did well. I  have a mathematical quality that   s pretty helpful. Where was I?  Finchum You were going to tell me about Vietnam. Wasn   t it? About stealing  mattresses.  Riley I had a Jeep assigned to me and once a week I   d get in that Jeep and  drive fifty miles down the only highway there, two-lane highway,  snaked through the wood to their camp and give them the forecast,  which they appreciated. I didn   t put it on the air because it   d be  intercepted. They slept on cots, the Green Berets, that were damp  already. They were stationed at Da Nang, right on the edge of the Viet  Cong. We slept on damp cots. They shaved, and they stayed shaved.  Had a post out there  with a mirror attached  to it. Well, you know.  They   d get out there in the cold and shave. I felt sorry for them, so I  stole a   I changed my Jeep for a pickup and loaded it with mattresses  and took it to the Green Berets. Half-size mattresses. Boy, I stacked  them high and tied them on. Fifty miles down the road to the Green  Berets. They did appreciate it. In return, they gave me   what they had  was steaks. They had food, better food than anybody. They gave me a  crate of steaks that I brought back. My weather assistant had a feast.  15  Bishop Did you serve any in Korea? Did you do any flyovers in Korea or     Riley Yeah, I never   that critique  newspaper article  says I did not flyover. I  want to correct that. I flew over it. I   ve never been in Korea except to  fly over it, but I got a Korean   I got credit for duty in Korea. That   s  about it.  Finchum So you weren   t serving, what did you do here? In between the wars,  what did you do?  Riley Well, on Martin Luther King Street, it   s all colored now. Then it was all  white. On Fifteenth and Martin Luther King I bought a barbeque stand.  What happened was a guy came to me and he said,    I want you to run  this   I   m going to buy that and I want you to run it for me.    I said,     No, I don   t want to take you up on that. If I   ve got a half-interest in it  and absolute control, we   ll open it up.    We went out and looked at it  and everything.  I said,     You have no control over it, we   re going to  pay me a salary. The profits, if there   s any over that, I   ll split with you.     So that   s the way it was.  Bishop So you ran a barbeque stand in-between services?  Riley Yes, it was different. The reason he wanted me   he thought I was  pretty capable. He   d watched, I   d managed   worked for Huddle House  and he   d watched me operate, flipping a skillet and this and that you  know. It was quite successful and different. When I went out there and  looked at it, I was   the guy that owned it owned a filling station next  door, so we bought it from him. It was very different. It was wired to  Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, the OG E   it was wired to  them, but they didn   t use them  Only as a standby.  All the girls, all the employees were women, and it was built in a circle  you know, and quite interesting. It had out in an outhouse behind it, it  had a diesel engine with a huge flywheel. I   d get out there in the  morning, get that flywheel spinning. Sometimes it   d spin me, (laughs)  and that was where we got our electric power, you know. It didn   t cost  anything except for the fuel we used, coal oil. Then it had a standby six-cylinder  automobile engine mounted on a stand. Out there it also had a  barbeque pit.  Bishop What was the name of your business?  Riley Well, I named it Circular Inn.  Bishop Say that again?  16  Riley Circular Inn.  Bishop You called it Circular Inn?  Riley Circular Inn.  Bishop That was the name of the barbeque restaurant?  Riley Yes. I stayed open until midnight every night, sometimes later. All my  employees were girls, women, and I had a friend, a big heavyset guy,  quite a guy. He worked for the Kansas City mob. He installed illegal  pinball machines in Oklahoma City, you see? He said,    Raymond, I  want to put one in your place. It   ll make you twenty-five dollars a day.     Well shoot. That   s more than I made otherwise. He said,    Trust me.    I  said,    Well, it   s illegal and I don   t want to break the law.    He said,    No,  don   t worry about that.    He said,    I   ve got the police department paid  off.     He did have them paid off  He said,    Now nothing   s going to happen  unless somebody complains. Sooner or later you   ll get a complaint,  because the whole world knows it   s illegal to come here and play slot  machines and get paid off if they hit so much.    Sure enough, after about  three days it made me twenty-five dollars a day. He said,    Now don   t  worry about the police. I   ll call you if you get a complaint. What I   m  going to do, have one of your girls pick it up, your girls, two or three of  them, and carry it out to the storeroom and lock it up.    Sure enough that  happened, you know. Then he called me and said,    All clear, put it  back.    The police department   he paid them off. That   s the only laws  that I broke I think.  Finchum Did you have your own recipe for the sauce? Barbeque sauce?  Riley Yeah, I did. Well, the guy that owned it, that I bought it from, had a  sauce he kept in gallons. It was pretty good sauce, that   s what I used. It  wasn   t my recipe really, but it sure did get the job done. I put in some     there was a brewery called Old Keene. You ever heard of it?  Bishop Old Keene? No.  Riley Yes, in Oklahoma City. They sold draft beer and there I had bottle beer  or tap beer. What I did to sell is I took mugs and I put them in the  freezer and when somebody ordered a draft beer I   d draw it, and set it  out there in the freezer. It worked, boy  They come from everywhere.  Made a lot of friends out there.  17  First car I ever owned, really, it was a Ford Coupe, a V8, a good one. I  forgot what I   oh yeah  He was an oil field regular. He came in, I   d  been fishing, and I caught some bullfrogs. I   d come back and barbequed  the legs, you know. Oh they were delicious, but I didn   t sell them.  These guys came in, brought his oil field crew with him you know. I  think it was four of them, sat down in a booth. I was frying those frog  legs, so I sat them right in front of those guys. They got through and  said,    How much?    I said,    Well, forget it. I can   t sell those, they   re  not       I   d get in trouble for selling frog legs that I went out there in  weeds, and bushes, and mud, and caught. (Laughs)  And they came back, one guy came back. He was a driller, and he came  back in a Ford Coupe. He said,    It   s for sale.    I said,    How much?    He  told me and I said,    I   ll take it.    He said,    I thought you would. Here   s  the keys. Put the money in your pocket, you get this car for nothing.     He gave it to me  It was a good car too   free. I drove it for a long time.  He became a real good friend.  Finchum Those frog legs did it.  Riley Frog legs did it  I did a lot of hunting and fishing. I was pretty good  with a rod and reel.  Finchum Did you ever think you   d make it to a hundred?  Riley I didn   t worry about it. I never gave it much thought. I always knew that  my genes were pretty doggone good. Course I saw my mother at the  circus in Shawnee I told you about. Then I saw her after she died, and I  buried her. Last time I saw her alive she didn   t know me. She was in a  rest home. That   s how I done.  Finchum She was a hundred?  Riley The doctors said they didn   t know how old she was. I didn   t really. She  was   when she put me on the doorstep I was actually three years old.  The article says I   m two, but I was actually three. I don   t know how my  adopted parents knew about all that, but they did.  Finchum What about your father?  Riley My father was kind of a no-good guy. I think he got married   course  my mother was his first wife, if they were married. He had, counting  her, got married seven times, so I got half-brothers and sisters. Mostly  in California.  18  Bishop What do you think your secret is to longevity? To long life? What   s your  secret?  Riley Genes. I drank, I never was   I always maintained control. I was never  drunk, but I got the buzz you know. Course I   ve been a rule breaker all  my life.  Finchum Did you smoke?  Riley The doctor, one doctor, said,    Sergeant Riley, you were born with a set  of lungs that are able to discard,    and I inhaled and everything.    You  were born with a set of lungs that you   re able to discard that, and it   s  not bothering you.    But I did have a set of lungs, I could stay  underwater, swim, which I did, swam in the ocean, and everywhere  else, and on the swimming team in school, and this and that. I could  swim   I could stay underwater five minutes. Never heard of another  Caucasian that could do that, but I did.  Bishop Having survived through three wars, and being involved. You said in  Vietnam you were shot at?  Riley Yeah, more action than in World War II. Mine was all airplanes. I did  the shooting. Sometimes gunner, sometimes, sometimes even co-pilot.  I   ve had some adventures. One time I took an airplane up for a test  drive and took a bunch of guys with me, all airplane mechanics. They  were sitting back in the bomb bay and played Poker. Had to fly a couple  hours. (Laughter)  Then one time   I think I told you. I took an airplane, a four-engine  loadmaster, it had new engines installed in it. It needed a two-hour  flight, so we flew to San Antonio. We were stationed at Tinker Field  and back. On the way back the Tinker Field said,    How much gas you  got?    At that point in time I was sitting up there as co-pilot. We told  them how much gas. They said,    Fly to Woodward,  Oklahoma . It   s  just been destroyed by a tornado and report what you seen.    So that   s  what we did. We were the first airplane over Woodward, reported back.  Bishop Was that in 1947?  Riley I   m not sure.  Bishop Because I know they had a tornado in 1947.  Riley I think about that time, yeah. I   m not sure. I   m kind of hazy for a lot of  this time.  19  Finchum So you had two daughters?  Riley Yeah. They are not on my team, neither one of them. (Laughter) They  both think I should be in a rest home.  Bishop You   re at the VA Center. What   s a typical day like for you? What time  do you usually get up?  Riley Now? Well, five o   clock.  Bishop You have any morning rituals or what do you do during the day?  Riley Well, about all I do is I do a lot of reading. A lot of the activities are  going on here, I take part in some of them. Bingo, all kinds of things, all  kinds of entertainment   bus rides. They take you places. Not a bad life  here, but really I feel like a prisoner because I know that I   m a good  driver. Nobody else knows that. I went through a sick spell and after I  got out of the hospital from pneumonia, I got in rehab. After that rehab  they brought me here.  Bishop What types of books do you read?  Riley All types.  Bishop Do you have a preference? Westerns? Novels? Biographies?  Riley All of them. Some writers are good writers, and some are not, you  know.  Bishop Who   s a good writer?  Riley Brown, I think his name   s John Brown. What   s that guy that wrote  the   I can   t think of his name. He wrote   I   m sorry. He wrote a  famous book, it was made into a movie called   a name of a little town  on a river which separates Mexico from us. Oh, New   can   t think of  the name of it, but that   s my famous writer. He wrote     Bishop Do you like Louis L   Amour?  Riley L   Amour? I   ve read his books, yes, but that   s not him. This guy  wrote   a famous movie called     Bishop Life on the Rio Grande?  Riley A little town sitting on the river that separates     20  Bishop Life on the Rio Grande? Is that a movie? Life on the Rio Grande, I  think that   s what he   s talking about.  Finchum So what time do you go to bed?  Riley About eight, sometimes between eight and ten. Sometimes I don   t even  go to bed.  Bishop When history   s written what would you like it to say about you? How  would you like to be remembered?  Riley I don   t know, that   s a tough question. I don   t have an answer to that.  Why should history say anything about me? I   m just another guy.  Finchum A rule breaker.  Riley Going through life breaking rules, still am  Right now I   m trying to  figure out how to get out of this place.  Finchum Do you remember when FDR did his speech about the war? About  Pearl Harbor? Do you remember where you were? You remember  hearing it?  Riley Pearl Harbor?  Finchum Yeah, the Day of Infamy, 1941? You may not.  Riley Yes. Boy, it   s hard to separate things. They drafted me. At one point in  time, they stopped volunteering   nobody could volunteer. They would  draft the people they wanted. They came to me and I worked at Tinker  Field, on the airplanes. They said,    Can we draft you?    I said,    You  can   t draft me. I   m working on airplanes. Nobody else could do what I  do.    They could probably, but I had a pretty good knowledge,  especially with carburation. They said,    We want you to volunteer to be  drafted.    I said,    You don   t take volunteers now. The law had changed.  They draft whoever they want.    He said,    We want you to volunteer to  be drafted because we need you in England.    They did. They had  airplanes over there with carburetor trouble. I told them,    There   s a  carburetor department over there     They said,    They can   t help us.     They overhaul the carburetors and test them, all in big sections and  work with them. He said,    They can   t actually do the fixing.    I knew all  that you know, because I came from Tinker Field.  So I volunteered for the draft. They sent my name in. I got over there  and once again, as I say, I   m right on the verge of trouble and breaking  the rules. (Laughs) I knew these guys you know, the carburetor  21  department, I   d worked with them. I said,    I can   t work with them, they  don   t need me. They do fine without me.    They said,    Well, what do  you want to do?    I said,    I   ll be a cook.    So I cooked for a while and  then they said,    We   re going to put you back in the carburetor  department and give you the rank we promised.    At that point in time I  was a corporal I think. I said,    No. They don   t need me over there.     They didn   t. I said,    I   d like to go to Flight Test in Burntwood. That   s  where they flew the airplanes and overhauled the engines. I said,    I  want to fly there.    That   s what I did. I got over in Flight Test, still in  England, you know. Boy, I had the adventures there. (Laughter)  Bishop Have you ever been on an Honor Flight to Washington D.C.?  Riley No, but I   m scheduled to be on one.  Bishop What do you look forward most about that?  Riley Yeah, I   m looking forward to it. I don   t know whether I should or not,  but     Bishop I think you might be one of the oldest vets out there   Riley Maybe. I   m the oldest vet here. Yeah, I   m looking forward to it.  Bishop And when are you going?  Riley In October, the twenty-third I think.  October 21, 2015   Finchum Soon.  Riley But I   m having trouble remembering things in the proper sequence.  Bishop Sure.  Finchum We thank you for sharing what you   ve told us today. Quite a pleasure.  -------  -------
