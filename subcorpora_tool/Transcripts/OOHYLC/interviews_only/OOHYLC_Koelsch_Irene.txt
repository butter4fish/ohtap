Oh, I did it for several years. We worked at night a lot of time when we  had to. Then I went to Norman. I took a beauty course, and I went to  Norman to work there. I don   t think I worked there but a year, and then I  came back home. Well, I really liked music, so I really did do a lot in  music.  Singing or playing the piano or     Playing the piano and then later on the organ. When we moved here, I  played at Saint Mark   s Catholic Church for almost thirty years.  Mom, what about you and Margaret and the radio station?  Oh, yes, I think it was KOTV. My sister and I played on the piano, the  two of us, a duet. We played one time.  Your claim to fame.  We played and sang. (Laughter)  How had you learned to play the piano? Did you have lessons?  I took lessons. My mother took in washings to pay for our lessons.  Oklahoma City in the   30s, do you have any stories about the city at that  point during the Depression?  Oh, yes, we had it bad then.  Soup lines and that sort of thing?  Did you have any soup lines? What was the atmosphere like in  Oklahoma City in the Great Depression?  Oh, it was windy and dusty, and it was hot at times.  What was life like in Oklahoma City during the Depression?  Oh, it was kind of bad. We had a tough time making it. It was hard. We  7  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  did a lot of walking. We didn   t have no transportation. We walked many  a time to church.  You all had a garden, Mama, didn   t you? Remember you were talking  about you and Margaret, wasn   t it, turnips, going and getting turnips?  Oh, yes, my mother, she milked a cow, and the neighbor had a whole  patch of turnips. My sister and I, we had an old wagon, and we had to go  get those turnips. When we got to one place there, boy, the lightning just  struck right there and knocked us down. We just got up and went after  our turnips. (Laughter)  Your mother did a lot of canning?  Yes, oh, yes, she did a lot of gardening.  Was your house in the city or     Well, it wasn   t right in the city. We kind of lived out, you know, but  there was plenty of neighbors and all.  Did you have to walk to school?  Oh, yes. I even went home for lunch, and, boy, I liked to play volleyball.  I would just run like everything to make it back.  And your favorite subject was business, you said.  Yes.  Did you have a favorite teacher?  Yes, let   s see. Which one was it now? It was, I believe it was Mrs.  Smith.  And what did she teach?  She taught grade school.  Grade school. So you went home for lunch. What would your mother fix  you for lunch?  Oh, she   d fix just as good as she could. The same old just regular meal.  We   d have potatoes, sometimes a little meat, eggs, and she liked to bake  pies for us.  8  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Did she raise chickens?  Oh, yes, a little bit. I raised rabbits for a while, and I butchered them and  sold them.  Was that here or while you were still there?  In Oklahoma City.  In Oklahoma City.  Yes.  Well, how did you come to be in Locust Grove?  Well, Jerry, he wanted a place for himself. We couldn   t find anything in  Oklahoma City, so we decided to go out and look. We looked all over  everywhere, and finally we got a phone call. It said they   d found this  place, and so we came down here. My husband liked it. I said,    Now, if  you like this, you better pay down on it,    so he did, and we bought it.  Why don   t you back up to when you got the place on Air Depot   Boulevard . You encouraged Dad, you remember, to buy that place.  Oh yes, on Tenth and Air Depot.  You always leased before that.  Yes.  Anyway, that   s what I   m saying. You encouraged Dad on that, to buying  that place, and eventually that   s how we was able to sell that and get this  here. You remember, Mom? You remember that all right?  No, I don   t Jerry.  I   m making myself clear.  No.  Remember, we lived in the bottom down there in the Magnolia place?  Oh, yes. Yes.  All right, and then that place up on the hill, and the part of it that was in  the bottom became available.  9  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Yes.  I remember you was after Dad to buy. Even he complained later because  when he had to make payments on the place, that money just, that was it.  Before, he was used to just leasing, and you encouraged him and stayed  after him until he bought that place up there on the hill. Anyway, that   s  where you had the money then, from selling that place     To buy this.     to put on this one here.  Now, do I have to tell what he said? (Laughs)  No, you don   t. It   s fine.  I want to know, talking about your husband, how did you meet him?  Oh, I met him at church.  Oh my gosh.  I   ll tell you, I   d play the piano, and they   d all dance, and they   d sing.  Oh, I   ve got to tell you a funny one. My sister was about   Joe was the  only one that had any money. The rest of us didn   t have any because we  weren   t working all the time. We always had ice cream. We all would go  up to this place, and it was quite a ways. My sister and Joe would go in  there and buy the ice cream, and the rest of us would wait out in the car.  They would come out with that ice cream, and they were walking along,  and we ran off and left them. (Laughs) This one guy that was with us, he  said,    Drive up there, and I   ll grab that ice cream.    He did. I drove up  real close, and he grabbed the ice cream, and we went on. They just  acted like it didn   t bother them, but we went back and got them.  (Laughs)  Mom, you know Dad   s sister, Irene.  Yes.  Okay. Remember about how you and Dad   wasn   t it about the skating  rink or something     Oh, yes. The church had a skating party, and so we went. I didn   t really  meet him then. They said,    Well, we   ll come by and pick you up.    So  okay, we went, and I was skating with Joe. He said,    You know I   m not  10  Bishop  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  a good skater.    I said,    Well, if you fall, you just turn loose of me.     Well, he did fall, and he hurt his leg. That   s when we started dating  because he said,    Would you go out with me Saturday night?    I thought  he was just joking. His sister said,    You   d better be ready.    (Laughter)  He was being serious. (Laughter)  And were you ready?  Yes, I was. (Laughter)  And where did you go?  Picture show.  You remember what you saw?  No, I don   t. (Laughs) That   s too long ago.  And then how much later did he propose and you get married?  Well, we went together for quite a while, and then we drifted off. Both  of us went the other way. I had appendicitis, and so they had to operate  on me. He came to see me, and his friend said,    I   ll pay for you to go see  her.    He said,    Oh, I will.    From then on, I knew I was going to marry  him.  How did he pop the question?  Well, I don   t remember. It wasn   t too much of popping the question. We  just automatically knew we   s going to get married.  And what did he do for a living?  He was a milk   dairy. Dairying and farming.  What year did you get married or     Thirty-five.  So kind of toward the end of the Depression.  Yes. Yes, it was bad.  And then the Dust Bowl came.  11  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  We belonged to the Jersey Cattle Club, and they chose him to go out and  pick some cattle for the sale. We got out in western Oklahoma, and, oh  my golly, the dust come up. He said,    Turn this thing around, and let   s  go home,    so we did. Yes, it was really bad. You couldn   t hardly see.  So how long were you in the dairy business?  Oh, ever since we got married.  A long time.  He was in it before we got married.  Even Grandma and Grandpa, I think, was in some to a point. His mom   s  the one that really encouraged him a lot in the dairy and everything.  See, he didn   t go to school but just through the eighth grade.  Did the dairy have a name?  No, we just     Mom, what about   Dad had the cattle, and P. H. Wilson, wasn   t it?  Well, yes it was     You had a partnership.  Partnership, yes.  Well tell them about before that, though. Tell them about yourself and  then     Well, we had a dairy out on Lincoln Highway almost to Edmond. It was  a parlor. They had big glass, and people would come by on Sunday and  watch them milk. We stayed there, I don   t know, a year or two. The  partner couldn   t pay us what we wanted, so we moved out and moved  into a little ol    two-room house. No electricity, we had to use a lamp,  and we had no facilities. I had to pump water with a pump. We had to  pump water for the cows that way. Then I had to heat the tank and put  the milk in the back of the car, take the seat out and put the milk cans  back there, and I would take the milk in. Jerry was just a baby, and so I  put him in a basket and set him up in front. Then they would unload the  milk. When he   d take the milk, I stayed home, and I took care of all the  utensils in the dairy barn.  12  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Finchum  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  That place that sold the milk was at Twenty-Third and Eastern, where  you took the milk.  Yes, yes.  How many dairy cows did you have?  Oh, golly, I don   t know. See we didn   t have   they had to milk by hand.  It was not like they do now.  Did you ever milk any of them?  No. Joe would go somewhere, and he got to talking, and he didn   t come  home right away when it was milking time. We had a hired man, so I  said,    Well, Jim, give me a bucket, and I   ll learn how.    He said,    You   re  going to be sorry,    (Laughter) so I put that bucket down and I left.  (Laughter) That would just give him more time to go talk.  I think you see, you went to that little place right there. Is that when you  went into the Magnolia place lease? No, you went down in the Detar  place.  Detar place, along the Canadian River.  Right.  Yes.  And then you went from there.  That was a rough living, there.  Yes.  Detar, is that the name of a place?  Yes.  Yes.  It was on Tenth     Oh, yes, Tenth.     on Tenth Street, just east of the Canadian River.  13  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Bishop  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Then when the kids were old enough to go to school, I was kind of  afraid that Joe wouldn   t let them go to a Catholic school, but, by golly,  he did. (Laughs) I had to take them every morning and go get them  every evening. Golly, how far was that? Three or four miles?  About five or six, probably six.  Somewhere. It was quite a ways. To get home, boy, I   d speed like  everything. Somebody saw me and said,    Joe, she sure was speeding.     It was about 19   it was before the Second World War happened when  we moved up into the Magnolia place because I started school from  there at Crutcho in first grade. Then after that, after one of the other kids  started having to go to school, that   s when you started because I went  the first year to Crutcho then Corpus Christi  School  after that.  Yes.  At that time, (that was in the   40s) I think Dad was milking the 120  head     Wow.     I believe it was. He had three milk hands and himself, and he started  at one o   clock in the morning and one o   clock in the afternoon.  Oh, and I tell you, they would get up so early, and he (Jerry) would not  sleep. I got up when Joe did at two o   clock, and I did my wash.  (Laughter)  That was in the days before dryers, too, I guess.  Yes, it was. Oh, yes. I had to hang them out, and I   ll tell you this funny.  My sister and I were there, and I was getting corn to can, and the  dadgum cows got loose. They all got out in the yard, and I had clothes  on the line. One cow come along, and I had a black apron, and that cow  just come right and slipped that over her face. She ran all over that place  after us. (Laughter) We liked to have died laughing.  I was trying to think. Oh, that   s what it was I intended to mention about  you. Dad done a lot of farming, too, several miles north and south and  east and west. He also took care of Bill Adkins, some of his place.  Oh, yes.  Bill got   he had bottom land before he started building. In all the  14  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  farming, you fed a lot of farmhands. She done a lot of cooking besides  all the other.  Oh yes, when they were harvesting, I had to make sandwiches, and I   d  bake a cake or pies or something to take out to for them to eat. That was  a tradition then. The women had to feed them in the evening.  You   d eat about four o   clock because you went     Yes, we had to work. I didn   t mind it.  And what would you do for fun?  Well, we didn   t do a whole lot.  No, it   s true. (Laughter)  It was work, work, work.  You even put the kids to work.  Sure, they did work. Yes, Joe had them working. They don   t do like kids  do now.  How many children did you have?  I had four. I had three boys and a girl.  And they all worked.  Yes. The girl worked just as much they did.  She had to take care of the calves.  Were they in 4-H or FFA  Future Farmers of America ?  Oh, yes. Joanne was in 4-H, and then the boys went into FFA wasn   t it?  We all were in 4-H and then went into FFA.  That   s right, yes. They showed cattle.  Dad showed a lot of cattle, too. He always did, even when he was in 4-  H. In fact, my first cow that I got was the granddaughter of the heifer he  got from Jersey  inaudible     when he was a teenager. I remember that  now. Lady. You remember Lady, the cow?  15  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Yes.  The old cow that was down in the Detar place was back in that back  barn. That was the first cow I milked. I wasn   t two years old. She was  old, and Dad kept her. Then he sold her daughter to Myers. Then she had  a heifer calf, and Dad bought that, and that   s when I started showing.  No, it wasn   t. That was my second year showing because remember the  first year you took me down to that township fair. I was barefooted. I  think I used a few words I wasn   t supposed to use.  Yes, I know you did. (Laughter). Oh, yes, when you went to school you  did. They called me in, and I thought,    Oh my gosh.     Was that at the Catholic school?  No, it wasn   t it.  If they   d had nuns that would have been taking care of.  Yeah, the nuns would have done that.  That   s the reason we went to Catholic school. I guess I caused that.  (Laughter)  Oh, I was so embarrassed when I had to go up there.  Well, how did you handle that?  Well, I just talked to them and told them that we had hired hands and  they liked to cuss. (Laughter)  In them days, a lot of the men did bad cussing, Dad, his brothers,  Grandpa, the hired hands, and all, and I was amongst all of them.  Yes, they learned all that. They learned the wrong thing, didn   t they?  (Laughs)  I don   t think the rest of them picked it up as bad as I did.  Oh, we used to have fun going to   now we did do this when he was in  school. We went to Crutcho. They   d have box suppers, and so I   d fix a  box supper. Joe would buy all them a box when we   d go. We had fun  doing that.  That was one thing you used to have was box suppers and     16  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Yes, about the only thing.     cake walks and all that kind of stuff. Used to, all these little schools  had that.  Yes, we had cake walks at the Catholic school.  Did you go to dances or play cards or that sort of thing?  Well, yes, we did play cards.  Mostly family, I think it was.  We didn   t go to dances much. I used to go to old red-barn dances when I  was single. The only light we had was to have a big old light.  What   s a red-barn dance?  Oh, it   s just a red barn, and they   d have dances in there.  Square dancing?  Yes.  Someone would play music, or did you sing? At the red barn, was  someone playing music?  Yes, they played, but nobody would sing.  Just played.  It was just a band, wasn   t it, Mom?  Yes. It was a ol    country band, you know.  Her dad used to play anything.  Oh, he was a fiddler. My dad was.  And what were some family traditions you had as a child?  Well     Work and work. (Laughter)  17  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Finchum  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Work and work and more work, sounds like.  I think so. I do know this. You know, we didn   t have toys like they have  now, and so we made us kind of like a T out of some sticks, and we   d  take one of these here deals that go around the barrel, you know, and  that   d be our hoop. We   d play hoop. We   d played mumble peg, and that  was one thing we liked to do was play mumble peg.  I   m not sure what that is.  What   s mumble peg?  Well, we   d have a knife, and we   d stick it in the dirt, and we   d flip it up,  and if it lit upright, then we won. We really liked playing mumble peg.  You take it like this, and depending on which way the points were, this  way, this way, or this way, if there   s one on one blade, two-blade, or  which blade it was, it was like that. That   s the way you flip it.  And kids carried knives?  Oh, boys did. Yes, they did, and none of them tried anything on  anybody.  You couldn   t get by with that today, could you?  That   s the difference now.  Yes.  No, they never did.  No, we didn   t.  They had their guns, and they never did shoot at anybody. They didn   t  dare.  Who was the disciplinarian at home?  My husband.  Yes. If she couldn   t catch me, she   d say,    You wait until Dad gets here.     (Laughs)  I   ll tell you what. My second boy, I was going to give him a whipping. I  forgot what he done now. He ran. Oh, he ran, and I ran after him, and I  18  J. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  lost him. My mother said,    I tell you, Irene, he   s right behind those  bushes out there.    Boy, when he come out, he got poison ivy. (Laughs)  He was in a poison ivy patch. Even if he is downwind from poison ivy  he   ll get it.  Oh my gosh.  He didn   t run anymore.  Well, he did one more time. You remember the time   my pony, my  Welsh pony? He   took off with him. He was running and hit that tree  and knocked him out, and     Oh, yes, yes.  Remember the rest of it?  No.  Well, it knocked him out, and you had to take him to Oklahoma City.  Oh yes, I did. I was trying to drive with one hand, holding him from  falling out. Oh, gosh, that was bad.  What kind of car were you driving?  Oh, it was an old     Thirty-six.  Well, yes I had that. Then I had an old pick up I had to drive. It was old.  It was an old clunker.  Now how did you learn to drive?  Oh, I drove before we got married.  Adolph  had a Model T, and I  learned on that.  Didn   t Adolph teach you how to drive, Adolph and George, your  brothers?  No, they did not. My sister bought her a car and then     Okay, I was thinking one of them taught you.  19  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J.

Oh, yes.  You want to tell them about that?  No, I don   t quite remember all that.  Well, you and Mamie  Vanarsdol , you had all those kids in there. I  think it was on Branch Road there. Y   all were talking with all these kids  in the back, and Bill or somebody opened the door and flipped him out  in the ditch.  Oh, yes, that was this woman that lived in an empty house we had, and  she was having trouble staying with her husband. I was taking her when  I went to get the kids. Bill, the youngest, he was little then   she just  went on and on. Joanne tried to say,    Mama, Bill   s out. He fell out.    He  opened the door, and out he went. Boy, I tell you, I thought he was dead.  Nobody would take me to the hospital.  What about the guy that caught up with you, though?  Oh, that was a taxi driver. He came by. Nobody would take me to the  hospital, and so this taxi driver said,    Did you want to go?    I said yes.  He took me, and I   ll tell you, I saw stop signs. He really went.  Well, who was it that caught up with you, though, and says,    Lady, you  lost a kid back there in the ditch   ? Don   t you remember?  I don   t really remember that.  Okay. I just sort of remembered. (Laughs)  No.  One of those kids did it. Someone opened the door, and the wind caught  it, and that   s what     Well, I think he caught it. He opened it.  Anyway, it slung him out.  Yes, he opened it. He wasn   t very old.  20  Finchum  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Finchum  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Bishop  J. Koelsch  Finchum  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  The days before seatbelts.  Oh, yes.  That was before, way before.  We never heard of seatbelts. (Laughter)  We didn   t know what they were. Yes, the world has really changed,  hasn   t it?  So what made you come to Locust Grove? You had farms, you   re  farming in Oklahoma City.  We wanted to sell out up there, and so we went hunting, and we found  this place. We decided we   d come here.  And you have a street named after your husband?  Joe Koelsch Drive   Oh, that   s after him, after Joe.  You must have been famous here.  Oh. (Laughs) Yes.  How did that come about?  The reason we left there is because     I think it was one of the teachers.      Midwest City and Del City, we were just getting completely pushed  out of anymore land there, and we had to move somewhere else.  The urban growth.  Right.  And that would   ve been when?  I came here, yes, I made it here in    55, and y   all come in    57, wasn   t it?  I didn   t like Oklahoma City. I wanted to move out of there so bad. I kept  saying,    Let   s go east,    so we did.  Yes, y   all hunted quite a while     21  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  Yes, we did.     because we almost wound up down around Mounds, wasn   t it?  Well, Eufaula was the place, and it was a bunch of blacks lived there.  Joe said,    Well, that   s okay. We   ll just build us a different house. They  won   t be bad.    But then we kept hunting more, and we found this. Well,  I think once we almost found a place around Tahlequah.  Also, there was one time, Mom, down there at Wellston, too.  Remember? We looked there at Wellston one time, back north of  Wellston, a place there, too.  I can   t remember all that stuff.  And did you continue the dairy farm here?  Oh, yes, we did. Then Joe decided he had to quit. Jerry, he wanted to  start in   well he was kind of started     Dad and I was together for quite a while.  He came here before we did. Joe had to sell the place up there. Donald  graduated, and we moved up here then. My mother stayed with Jerry  when he     Remember after y   all got here? Dad wasn   t here very long, and he  wanted to go back, remember?  Oh, yes, he wanted to go back, but he went up to the sale barn, and he  got up there, and it wasn   t too long they wanted to sell the sale barn.  Boy, he bought it. (Laughter)  Dad loved to trade cattle. Dad loved to trade cattle, and that   s what his  problem was. He lost all of his traders up there he traded with. Then he  went down here, and then he lost them. Then he got that sale barn, and it  was a go then.  And, you know, we had a flea market up there. Jerry still has the flea  market. We had a flea market, and I had to collect up there. He had a  partner at the sale barn, and the partner wanted out, so Joe had it all to  himself. I had to go to work in the office then.  Did he give up dairying to do that, or did he do both?  22  J. Koelsch  Finchum  J. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  J. Koelsch  What it was, Dad and I was here at a Grade A dairy here. Then when he  bought the sale barn, I stayed here, and they moved down to the other  place where I   m at now. Dad just more or less, him and Jim, they had to  do it small, Grade C dairy down there where he could trade cows back  and forth that way. He was still dairying until   well, he done it for  forty-eight years. I know that.  That   s a long time. So is there a story behind the street name?  Dad was well-known at the sale barn, the county commissioner, and all  that. After Dad passed away, I went down there and asked them. It was  just a county road. That   s when they changed it. They just changed it.  And is there a story about this place? You were telling us when we came  in.  Oh, about the     The county attorney.  That he got killed here. Well, everybody thought I was afraid because of  that, you know. I was pulling my shades down, and this man says,    Oh,  are you afraid?    I said,    No, I   m just pulling the shades down.    Yes, it  was kind of scary, you know, to think that somebody   . He lived right  out there. They put rocks out there where he fell.  What the deal was, they didn   t want me to move the pile of rocks when I  moved in here. Finally we come to an agreement. I drove a steel rod in  the ground and moved the rocks. She come along, and she poured all  that concrete out there herself. (Laughter)  I didn   t want his body there. (Laughter) I did a lot of gardening here, and  I still do some. Jerry brought me some cow troughs, and I planted onions  here. I shouldn   t have planted them so soon because it   s going to freeze  tomorrow. I   ve been planting some tomatoes and things.  She had a garden up on that hill out of them ol    rocks   on that hill up  there, a garden spot up there and down here, both.  Oh, I had a good garden up on that hill.  We wondered where the steps went to.  No, those was there. I don   t know what deal   we never did know about  those steps.  23  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I.

Koelsch  Bishop  I used to mow all this lawn.  Yes, she did.  Had a little ol    tractor, and I used to mow it.  A lot of that stuff, though, she didn   t wait around on Dad for this or that.  If she decided she was going to do something, make something or build  something, she done it.  Well, I couldn   t sit still. (Laughter)  That may be why you   re a hundred.  I didn   t think I   d make it this far.  Did your siblings? Did your brothers or sisters?  Well, I don   t think they did.  No, she   s got one left that   s ninety-two or -three. I don   t remember.  Oh, you said sisters. Yes, I got one sister left, and she   s six years  younger than I am.  And her brother that   s older than her  Adolph Swanda  was almost 103  when he  died .  Yes, he lived that long.  What about your parents?  Well, they didn   t   Mama was seventy-eight, and Dad was much older  than Mother.  He was around ninety, wasn   t he?  Close to it.  Right in that neighborhood.  All of those Swandas, they lived up in the nineties. They liked their  wine. (Laughs)  Red or white?  24  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J.

We   d go  out there and pick all these grapes.  On this place?  No, in Oklahoma City. Oh, yes, we had our keg of wine down in the  basement. (Laughter) All those Bohemians, they had their wine.  Well, that may be why you   re a hundred then.  You think so? (Laughs)  She likes the elderberry wine when she drinks.  Do you have any idea why you lived to a hundred? Any secrets?  No, I don   t, unless it   s I liked to work. Maybe that. I don   t know if it   s  that or not. Well, I feel like I   ve had a happy life.  She   s real strong in our church.  So I was going to ask, how important is religion? Has religion played     Very much.     in your life?  Yes, very much so because I really enjoyed playing the organ at church.  I really did, and I hated because I had to quit. I was sitting there playing  the last hymn, and this girl was singing. I hollered at her, and I said,     Hey, I can   t go any further. This eye   s gone out on me, too, now.     Father kept saying,    Aren   t you going to play?    I said,    Well, Father, I  can   t see anymore.     She used to go back. When Saturday night mass would come along     Yes, I would.     she would play Saturday night and then go back Sunday morning and  play again, until that wreck happened and she couldn   t drive no more.  I bet you I played for every wedding and funeral. I told my husband     something was said, and he said,    You don   t take money for funerals,  but if they get married, you can take that.    (Laughter) A lot of them  didn   t pay you. They just didn   t, but I didn   t care. I just enjoyed doing it.  25  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Finchum  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Finchum  Bishop  I. Koelsch  What are some things you do today? Do you go to church?  Oh, yes. Well, right now I haven   t been because of my knees. It   s hard  to make it, but I   ve tried. I   m going to, I hope, for Easter. I don   t know. I  hope I can. The second boy, he goes to church every Saturday night.  Jerry does, too. Well, they all four go. I hope I can start going back. It   s  my knees, you know. I can   t get up and walk by myself. I have to have  this (gestures to walker). I do sweep my floors, and I scrub.  What   s a typical day like for you?  Well, I don   t like the day. I like the daylight now, like it is.  What time do you wake up and go to bed nowadays?  Well, I usually go to bed ten thirty or eleven. I wake up during the night,  and then I wake up four o   clock. Well, here lately, I   ve been waking up  two o   clock, so then I try to go back to sleep, and then I   ll wake up at  four. A lot of time I get me a nap in the daytime. (Laughter)  And do you garden during the day, or do you read, or do you     Well, I don   t do a whole lot. I just planted some onions now, and that   s  all I   ve done. I got some squash started. I got that.  She makes rosaries.  And your rosaries, tell us about the rosaries.  Oh, yes. I have a friend that went to church, and she came over one day,  and she said,    I   m going to teach you how to make a rosary.    I said,     Okay.    I got started, and I   m telling you, I really do love to do that. I  feel like I   ve done something. It   s free. I do it for free, you know. I have  to buy my own beads. There   s more than one hospital in San Antonio,  and I send them a bunch of beads, and you know they wrote me a letter.  They said,    We want your beads.    Every time they need beads, they  write me a letter, and I send them beads. I send them around, sometimes  two hundred at a time.  Whoa.  Your rosaries that you made. Wow. How many do you make in a day?  Well, since I   ve been down, I try to make two and three a day. I sit in  front of the TV now, and I watch TV. I can   t see the TV, anyway, so I  just make rosaries while I   m sitting there. Just before you came I  26  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  was   then I had that mistake. (Laughs). I   ll have to cut it up. I   ve done  that more times here the last couple of days.  You have made and sent off thousands of rosaries.  Yes, I   ve made a lot of them. I wish I   d have kept track of how many  I   ve made. Well, let   s see. It was right after Dad died in    77 that she  came and taught me how, so I   ve been making rosaries   I   m going to  say, in    78. I   ve been making them ever since then.  Forty, almost forty years.  That   s one thing in my old age I can keep doing.  And you said you ran a flea market.  Yes.  How   d that get started?  Well, it was already here when we moved here. Then when Joe bought  that, I did the collecting out there. Oh, we had a lot of fun there.  It   s supposed to be the oldest flea market in the state. It goes back     Yes. You   ll have to come up there sometime. You   d enjoy it.  I   ve heard about the flea markets on this side of the state and down in  Muskogee. (Laughter)  Well, this is different here.  This thing goes back to the old sale barn when the old peddlers would  come through and set up and stuff like that. That   s what it goes back to.  They had cut trees and made stuff out of the limbs for shade and  everything like that. Well, finally there was a lady that got to leaving her  stuff there, and it caught fire and burned.  That was a black woman that had that     Right         she had her clothes in there and it caught fire.  Okay. Anyway, Dad says,    Look, I know this is my property and all  that. I   m going to give each one of you so much.    I don   t know what he  27  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  J. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  give them. Mom might remember. He just tore them all down, and then  he built these sheds up there that   s there now, and he kept control of  them after. He said,    You can   t go to leaving stuff like that there.    I   ve  built a few since then. Then the barn burned. It burned the same time  when Dad passed away, wasn   t it? Yes. That was   because the guy  found out about    Dad had sold it in contract, remember, Mom?  Yes.  Then the guy found out that Dad had that heart attack at five o   clock,  and eight o   clock the barn was on fire.  Yes.  I know the banker and I had time. We finally found him. Anyway, we  bought the thing, and then I finally bought it off of you. I rebuilt it, and  that   s when it really burned up. We think it   s the same guy, but we don   t  know.  It burned   I was working for you at the Dari-Ette when that happened.  Yes, she was doing that.  At the Dari-Ette? What   s that?  Well, he had a Dari-Ette, fast foods, and I worked up there for a long  time. I kept his books, too.  We passed right by it.  Right.  Did you cook up there and kept the books?  Yes. I cooked a lot of hamburgers.  I bet you saw a lot of high school kids come through.  Oh, yes. Oh, yes.  You had several you worked with and taught too in there, high school  kids.  Yes. We had fun. I had fun with those young ones. They were a lot of  fun.  28  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Finchum  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Well, do you have a philosophy or motto you live by today? Some people  have a philosophy of life or some type of motto they live by.  Uh  (Laughter) I don   t know.  We often hear,    I live one day at a time.    Other people tell us other  things.  Oh, shoot, I don   t know what to tell you. (Laughter) I don   t know.  I think you enjoy life, though, as a whole.  Did you sew?  Oh, gosh yes  You ought to see the quilts I made. (Laughs)  Now she lit up  (Laughter) That   s a question I forgot. We usually ask  that when we have anyone from the farm.  Oh, yes, I made quilts. My daughter said she   s got ten that I made her. I  said,    Oh, I don   t remember giving you ten.    My daughter   s girl, well,  she had three girls, and they went to Catholic school in Tulsa. I made all  of their uniforms, so I was busy, busy sewing.  Was it one of the  treadle  sewing machines?  Oh, I had an electric sewer. I bought me one not too long ago so I could  keep on sewing, and it was no good.  Well, you made quilts. Every one of the grandkids has got a quilt.  Yes, and I made quilts for everyone that got married. The last one that  got married here about, I don   t know how many years back, he said,     Well, where   s my quilt?    His mother said,    Well, she can   t sew no  more,    so he didn   t get a quilt.  You   ll have to give him one of the ten.  Yes.  I guess so. (Laughs)  Time to take them back. (Laughter)  And he   s got some of them.  29  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  Finchum  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  You have great-grandchildren, too, I assume.  Oh, yes, I did. I made them.  Well, who taught you how to do that?  My mother. She used to quilt. She   d quilt quilts for people, and she  quilted a lot. I didn   t quilt them, but she would quilt mine until she left  us.  She used to quilt in that room in there, too.  Did she have the racks from the ceiling?  No.  No, she had a homemade one. She had a long   with nails, you know,  and then she   d take these clamps and clamp it. She   d sew so far, and  then she   d have to roll it, and then sew so far and then roll it. I tried it  once. I got me one that stood up, but I didn   t like it. I   d rather make  quilts.  I   ve got the one from her   it was her mom or her grandmother   s quilt  top. I guess it was her mom, wasn   t it? I   ve got it, and it   s got all the  state birds and state flowers.  I   ve got two quilts that I   ve made before I got married, and I   ve still got  them. I   ve got them in my cedar chest. I don   t know who wants them.  They   re just made for     Grandson. (Laughter)  They   re just made for a regular sized bed. We didn   t have large beds  then, just regular sized. These are just regular sized. I   ve got two of  them. No, I   ve got three. I   ve got three.  You need four. There   s four of us. (Laughter)  They can fight over them after I   m gone, or maybe they can have a sale.  The flea market.  Yes. I   ll tell you what, one of my grandsons, one of them got married.  He got married up there, and they took all the quilts that I made, that I  give them, and they hung those quilts all around there.  30  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I.

What did you do for your hundredth birthday?  I didn   t do much.  You didn   t have a party?  Oh well, now wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait a minute.  They took me out. They took me out to this eating place.  You had two of them, Mom.  Yes, I know had two. The church gave me one, and that was really nice.  Then     Country Cottage.  The Cottage, yes. We had two of them up there, Jerry.  No, wait a minute. No, not for     Oh, well, the hundredth. Yes, that   s        the hundredth. We went up there before.      the ninetieth. They give me one for the ninetieth, then the hundredth.  What did you tell somebody? Up there on your hundredth when  somebody asked you something, you was like,    Still the future.    You  was still here in the future. I forgot what it was or how you answered  them.  Father comes every now and then and gives me communion. There   s a  lady that goes to church. She lives up here, and she comes every Sunday  and gives me communion. He says,    Oh, we pray for you every  Tuesday.    I said,    Good.     Only Tuesday?  31  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I.

I don   t know why, but he said,    Every  Tuesday, we pray for you.    I said,    I don   t care what day.    (Laughs)  Any day is fine. How important has prayer been for you?  Oh, it   s been really nice.  And do you do any devotionals in the evening?  No, I don   t.  Reading or reflecting?  Oh, I say my rosary. I tell you, that second boy of mine was so late  Saturday night. His car, it had car trouble, so he fixed it. He   s a  mechanic. The church, every second Saturday night, they have a meal,  and we go there. You don   t have to pay for it, and so we go there. Well,  I hadn   t been going, and so he went, and I said,    You call me if you  aren   t going to be here, or call me if you will.    You know, he didn   t call  and didn   t call, and I got real worried. Let   s see. What was I going to tell  you about that? Anyway, he finally got over there by the industrial place  and called me and said,    I   m over here.    (Laughs)  He   s done that before. Go to work on somebody   s car and never even  call you and tell you, and then we   re all hunting.    Where   s he at?     He   s bad about that.  You   re still parenting     Yes, I am.     at a hundred.  Oh, I know what I was going to tell you. I said three rosaries before he  come home. (Laughter)  Once a parent, always a parent.  That   s right. My mother used to say,    When they   re born       Let   s see.  How was it?       Whenever they grow up they step on your heart.     Yes, here just a while back there was something I got real busy with.  Two days, I wasn   t by here. I got a call one night.    Are you okay? I  hadn   t seen you in two days     (Laughter)  32  I.

Yes, this is my home. I don   t want to leave it. My daughter, she says  right after   well, I   ve fell two or three times, and she says, trying to talk  me into going to the nursing home. I said,    No, you   re not going to talk  me into that. I was in one when I was in those wrecks.    I was in five  wrecks, and the last two is what put me out. I said,    Oh, no. I was in a  nursing home, and I   m not going to go again if I don   t have to.    I  wouldn   t want to go there.  And your wrecks, were they recently?  Well, let   s see. It was in June. It was June    02, I think, I was in a wreck.  That was the last one.  So over time.  Jerry, we were in his car, and this girl didn   t stop.  She  hit  us , and,  boy, it turned us over.  We didn   t hit her. She hit us and rolled us.  Yes, boy, I tell you, we had a bigger car than she did. My legs went  numb on me, but they finally came back.  We were upside down.  That   s what   s hurting me.  So you have quite a little bit of     Yes, then Joe and I were going to a funeral one time. We got over there  by Inola, that bridge. Somebody   s cows got out, and I was driving, and I  hit one of them. I killed it, (laughter) but that wasn   t my fault.  Those can do some serious harm, damage.  Yes, oh, it   s bad. Then of course, I had  was  in a wreck with my second  33  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I.

That last one I can still remember because I called  Joanne . She was  still living in Tulsa, and I called. Y   all had been in the one before and  that helicopter deal where it cost     You ever been in a helicopter?  Have you? I haven   t been.  One time, and that   s the last time, I hope. That   s the roughest-riding  thing you ever rode. Whoo  I feel like I was rolling all over there. They  had to put my son in one and put us both in the same one.  Oh, my gosh.  Right.  Yes.  I was thinking of the one where they hit all of us, how they got hurt and  I didn   t. I was the driver, and he hit me right there on the shoulder. Then  she wound up over at the hospital, and the doctor said she   d never walk  again. My sister says,    You don   t know her.    (Laughter)  I did. (Laughs)  So you   ve had quite a few cases there. You call that survivor   s luck or     I guess.  Somebody   s watching out for you.  Yes. (Laughter)  I tell you, she   s pretty tough about things, too. After that other walker  she had out there, I remember that on a Saturday night going to church,  we started out there. She said,    I don   t need this anymore     and she  throwed that over in the garden, that walker. (Laughter) She walked until  she got finally here to the last place.  I can   t do that now, can I?  How long have you had   what   s it been? We don   t not know where that  thing come from. We thought it was my cousin     34  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I.

It showed up, and she  wasn   t going to have it. Joanne and I got it out here and says,    Look,  Mary Ann sent this to you. You know that?    So she started using it. She  liked it, and she   s been using it ever since. Turns out, Mary Ann said,    I  didn   t send it.    We don   t know where it come from.  We don   t know who sent this to me. (Laughter) We don   t. I got one  grandson that might have, but he won   t say that he did. It came from that  way where he used to live, so I don   t know. Gave me a nice one. I have  a hard time. I try to sweep, and I have to push this around to get hold of  it and push my broom.  Well, do you do much of your own cooking now?  Oh, yes, I cook for my second boy. I tell him,    Well, it keeps me from  being lonely.     Twice a day.  He quit me. (Laughter) He thought it was too much, I guess.  Do you have a favorite food or recipe?  Oh, yes, I fix banana cake, and I got one chocolate cake recipe, no eggs.  It   s good. And I like cheesecake. I got a good recipe for cheesecake.  You must have a sweet tooth.  I have. (Laughter)  That stove that   s in there   I   ve watched her. Twice I   ve caught her  where she went past that click and went too fast, and I caught her. Come  in here, and it   s just the gas on, no fire. I showed her how it works, so  since then, I   ve watched her. She sticks her finger down in there when  she can   t see good. Now, she sticks her finger down in there, and she  feels the heat come on, and then she   ll go ahead and turn it on. I   ve seen  her do that a bunch of times.  Well, it   s hard when you can   t see.  Gas is tricky, too.  I was seeing enough that I could really do a little bit more, then the  35  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Bishop  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  doctor said that,    You   re not going to lose any more of your eyesight.     Shoot, I have. I   ve lost a lot of it in this eye now. I had glaucoma, and  then blood come into this eye. He had to shoot me in that eye with a  needle, and, oh boy, that was horrible.  Well, you   ve had that   up there in Oklahoma City, that doctor, what   s  his name? Skinner? Which one done the operation on your eyes? They  done an operation on you once.  Oh, I had Bolin in Tahlequah, and then I had  Gregory  Skuta in Tulsa.  No, the one in Oklahoma City, Mom, right there where you went to  junior high at. You told me when I took you up there, you said,    Right  there   s where I went to junior high.     Oh.  Dean   what was it?  Oh, Dean McGee  Eye Institute .  Right, there you go.  Well, that   s where Skuta, the doctor I went to.  Okay, right.  He   s the one that operated.  So when history is written, what would you like it to say about you?  I hope you say I   m good. (Laughter)  You   re good at what?  Oh, good at anything.  Is there anything you want people to remember you for?  Well, I hope they remember that I was good and kind with them.  Anything on your bucket list left to do?  For you to do?  For you to do.  36  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  J. Koelsch  I. Koelsch  Oh, for me to do.  Anything left that you want to do and haven   t done yet?  Well, no, I don   t think so. I think I   ve just about done    I don   t know of  anything. I   m trying to garden now. Going to try that again, but I don   t  know of anything else.  I   ll tell you what, I don   t know how many times I   ve caught her,    Oh, I  wish these eyes weren   t this way. I   d do this, and I   d do this, and I   d do  that.    (Laughs) I   ve heard her say things like that around here.    I   d do  this and I   d do different things if I could just see,    she   d say.  Every once in a while   they   ve all got a key to come in the door, and  I   m in here just talking to myself. (Laughter) They hear me talking. I  said,    Well, you get old, you   ll talk to yourself.    My daughter said  something, and I said,    No, I   m talking to God.     Okay, Mom, you could still...from that organ. You remember, from your  hundredth?  Oh yes. I have three hymns that I had memorized, and I can still play.  On her hundredth birthday, after it was over with, I took her over to the  church. I   ve got one picture. Eugene snapped it. Not quite the one I  remember, but it   s still good. The joy in her face. I can remember. She  didn   t wait until I got that thing adjusted, though. She just hit it, and,  boy, she went with it. (Laughter)  Well, that   s one thing in my life I always wanted to do. I had wanted to  play a pipe organ. My one brother said,    Well, I   ll send you to Kansas  City.    Well, we were so hard up, I never got there, so I never did, but I  played the old pump organ in church in Oklahoma City. Oh, I had a  horrible time. This girl, she was going to be gone and wanted me to play.  Oh, I didn   t want to play that. I come here, and they had a pump organ.  They told me to take that pump organ home with me and I could  practice. I did, and then I went to church one night, confession, and I  told Father Murtagh, I said,    I   ll go in with you to rent an organ for  Christmas.    He didn   t say nothing. I went to church next time, and he  had an organ there.  He bought one.  He had us an organ. My mother left me a little bit of money, and I  bought me that organ.  37  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  Finchum  I. Koelsch  So you have an organ here?  Yes.  Oh, would you play something for us when we finish?  Yes, sure, if you   ll overlook my mistakes. (Laughter)  I will. Wait just a minute. Anything else you want to say before we  close?  No, but y   all are nice people.
