 Finchum  Hopkins  Today is August 5, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in  Norman, Oklahoma to speak with Delmar Hopkins and he   s going to tell  us a little bit about his hundred-plus years of life. Let   s start with having  you tell us when and where you were born.  I was born Honey Grove, Texas back in 1908, May the thirteenth.  Born at home?  Yeah. Mothers had family come in, women, come in to take care of  having babies. We didn   t have no doctors back there.  Kind of like a midwife?  A midwife, yeah.  And how many brothers and sisters?  I   m the ninth one, so there were nine of us in all.  So you were the baby.  Baby, yeah.  Did your parents farm?  Yeah, most of the time they had their own farm    til it got tough. Then  they ended up helping out other farmers. They had to give up their farm  5  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  because there was too many droughts and too many things happening.  They couldn   t make it. Yeah.  And where did you go to school?  I went to school in Denison.  Denison?  Denison, Texas. Yeah.  Would you have to walk?  Yes, no buses back then. (Laughs) We were lucky we moved out of east  Denison over to west Denison and we moved right across the street from  Anderson School. So, the school was right across the street.  Did you get to go home for lunch then?  What lunch there was. (Laughter) Back then, we didn   t know what lunch  was.  Well if it was, what would it be?  Well, most of the time it would be cornbread, beans, and potatoes,  cabbage; stuff like that. Yeah. I ate a lot of oatmeal when I was a kid  coming up. I had oatmeal every day. I loved oatmeal and I rode a bike  after I got up in the age. I rode a bike. After we moved to Chickasha, I  rode a bike back and forth to the WPA, yeah, about thirteen, fourteen  mile out of town. I just rode a bike and I rode a bike back and forth to  the compress. Finally, we was riding around and stopped in the used car  lot. We went in to get us a drink, of water, and the guy   s son seen my  bike and he wanted it. He said we could pick any car out there on that  lot, on the front line,    You can have, trade even for your bike,    and I  picked out a   29 Chevrolet. (Laughter)  What did you do for the WPA?  We went out and built bridges and went from that into building  playgrounds for the kids and we put a wall, a brick wall, around the  playground up so high, you know, out of bricks. We laid bricks, we  called it, concrete and put bricks in it.  And about how old were you when you were doing that?  I was about thirteen or fourteen years old.  6  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  So how far did you get in school?  Fifth grade.  Fifth grade?  Yes.  And then what did you do?  I went to work. I moved to Chickasha and went to work at the compress  and then from the compress, all of this is on that board there, and went to  work at the compress. Then the war broke out and I went to California  and worked in the shipyard. Before then I was working, here in Norman,  building the base for the soldiers, and then I decided I wanted to go to  California. I sold my watch to get my fare to go to California. (Laughs)  That was back in    40 and I left my wife behind, and she stayed behind  for two months before I could send for her. So, after we left the  shipyard, after the war was over, I ended up in Roswell, New Mexico  working compress there and worked a compress in Roswell for one  season then we went to Arizona and worked awhile for a compress in  Arizona. Then from there back to Roswell and then to Chickasha.  Then I went to Tinker Field   got a job welding at the Tinker Field in     49 and I welded from    49 up to    52 in Tinker Field and I decided the  pay wasn   t enough. I moved to Denver, went to Denver in    52 and  started to work painting cars and the way, we painted so many cars for  the boss and then anything over that, we   d get a bonus and my bonus  ended up being like  1300. That   s what I bought my home   started  buying a home with that. I worked for the man for twenty-seven years  until my wife took sick. She had breast cancer and she wanted to come  back to Oklahoma. So we moved back to Oklahoma over on 1227  Glenwood here in Norman. That   s where she passed away back in    85.  She was eighty some years old. Forty-seven years we were together.  What was the secret to keeping it that long?  (Laughs) Just being busy. Staying busy. We had a lot of fun.  Did you?  Yeah. We danced. We went to parties. Went to big balls, you know,  where there   d be guys come in to play for the dances. We   d go to  Oklahoma City, different places, El Reno. We were just busy. They said  we stayed on the road so much we didn   t have no home  (Laughs) The  7  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  highway was our home.  Well, all the travelling, from here to California, was it in your    29 car?  The first time I went out on a bus and I bought a    38 Chevrolet out there,  and then when I came home on a visit I drove the    38 Chevrolet back  home. The funny thing about it is they told me,    You can   t drive it  through the mountains without having extra gas.    So, I bought a big ole  five-gallon can, set it on the front bumper, wired it on there, and I got  out in the middle of the desert and we seen this filling station open. We  stopped in there and he said,    What   s the can for?    I said,    I wanna fill it  up with gas.    He said,    For what?    I said,    I   m trying to get across the  desert.    He said,    You won   t need that    and so I just carried the can and  didn   t really need it. (Laughs)  I don   t know why they got the idea that you couldn   t cross. Well, a lot of  the cars would run hot, and you   d see them when you got to that  mountain. They   d be going up that mountain and by the time they got to  the top they   re boiling, and a lot of them, before they got to the  mountain, they   d take the radiator hood and raise it up and prop it up so  high and then they   d cool off that way. I didn   t have no problems. I had  my cooling system worked on before I left. So I didn   t have problems  like that. That was back on Route 66   one going and one coming and  they was so close together you could reach out touch the truck or car  almost when they come by. A truck you could.  Going up the mountains, you got up there to the table top, you   d call it,  and everybody would rest up there. Get to the top of the mountain and  one guy was coming through the mountain and they was blowing at him,  he said, and honking at him. He was talking about how friendly we  were. Come to find out, he was smoking and had all the windows rolled  down. He was knocking ash off and it flew back in the back. Thumped  his cigarette out and it went back and set the car on fire, and he didn   t  know it. (Laughs) Smoke was coming out and that   s when the people  started honking at him. We had a lot of fun. I tell you. We traveled  around.  When you say you worked at the compress, what would you do?  We were baling cotton, in Chickasha, there. We would take the cotton  bales that would come from the gin, big and flat, and we   d bale them  and press them and make them about this small, (gestures) same length  but smaller, same weight then they had a high D, they called it, then they  had one that was oblong that was standard but high D was square   it  was just square, like a box, you know, but it was smaller. And we did  that and then we would load cotton, send it out of town, load trucks and  8  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  we had fun doing that. Ten cents an hour, sun to sun, fifty cents a day.  Kept in shape that way.  Yes, same way when we was chopping cotton. We would chop cotton  sun to sun, fifty cents a day. Yeah, that was a tough time but we thought  it was a good time. We enjoyed it. Everything was cheap. You could get  a pound of butter for fifteen cents, a dozen eggs for six or seven cents  and salt pork for four or five cents a pound. Kerosene, you could get  kerosene six or seven cents a gallon, and white gas was seven cents a  gallon, and look at the gas now. I can   t believe it. I would never, ever  thought the gas would be this high. Matter-of-fact, I never thought the  world would be like this. It has all the tall buildings, and you go to  California and it   s a concrete wall. All the viaducts and overpasses,  things so crooked going all over. You don   t know where you   re at one-half  of the time. (Laughs)  What would you do in the shipyard?  I weld in the shipyard. Went to school learned how to weld and you pass  three plates, horizontal, flat, and then one they called up. I passed them  and I helped out in school. I caught on real easy and I helped out in  school. And then they   d move you out in the yard. Then from the yard,  they   d put you up on the ship. I was welding the nose part of the ship  that goes in the water, and you go up all the way over, back behind you  like that, and you work there all night. By the time you get through, you  had to put a cover pass, they call it. If you put a seam like here, then you  have to put a cover pass on and make it about that wide to keep it from  leaking, they call it. It was very interesting. I enjoyed doing that and if  you weren   t careful and didn   t use your goggles and your hood, you   d  get a flash, and your eyes would burn and turn red. Never got one. The  whole time I was working there, I never got a flash. I was lucky. It   s like  painting cars. Guys would end up with cancer painting cars and I never  had no problem. Painted cars twenty-seven years. Of course I was  drinking a lot of vodka back then. (Laughs) My boss and I, we drank the  vodka. (Laughs)  Are you serious?  Yeah. I was drinking vodka every day. You   d go out with your friends  and they   d ask you to drink before they   d ask you to eat. (Laughs) I  never will forget when I went to California, the first thing they said was     Come on, have a drink     and I was like    Man, I   m hungry. I   ve been  traveling all day     Been sitting there on that bus   it   d take the bus about  all day and night to get you there.  9  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Well, did your wife work?  Yeah, she worked in the shipyard. She learned how to weld, and she  passed and moved up on the ship. She was afraid up on the ship, and she  quit. Then  went to  the Douglas Aircraft, building fuel tanks, she was  still working in the shipyard but she was in another shipyard.  And she was a welder?  Yeah.  Were there very many women welders?  A lot of women welding, shipping, doing the same things men was  doing   had the welding gloves and things. Had them big long gloves,  the hood and everything. They   d be going three o   clock in the evening  working until eleven at night   come out.  How many children did the two of you have?  Me? Just one son. No grandkids. He married twice. His first wife had no  kids and she didn   t want  any  and the second wife, she didn   t want any  kids. Nice lady though but no grandkids for me. (Laughs) I miss that. I  wonder how that would be. I see so many of them come out there on my  job with the grandkids and they seem so happy with them. I just wonder  what did I miss in life that I didn   t get any. Some say you   re lucky you  didn   t get them and some are very lucky they got them. So, I didn   t  worry about it.  And you came back to Oklahoma for a little while and then went back to  Denver?  I moved back to Oklahoma in 1979. She took sick and wanted to come  back and that   s when I moved over to 1227 Glenwood.  And what kind of work did you do for Tinker?  Welding.  Welding again?  Yeah. I worked at the dealership, Honda dealership, and I was detailing  cars, and they finally took me off detailing cars and put me on the road  picking up parts and picking up the mail and taking people parts and  getting parts. I did that until he lost it. Then after he lost that, his wife  bought a place over there on Floyd, renting cars, and his daughter said,  10  Finchum  Hopkins     Delmar, you need to go back. My dad needs you.    I said,    For what?        He wants to put you to work.    I said,    Over there? A little small place  like that?    and I went over there and he did. He put me back to work and  I   ve been there ever since. He passed away about three or four years ago.  His wife passed away one day and a week later he was gone. He   d been  in the hospital and they was getting ready to take him out to dinner, his  daughter, and took a backset and the doctor said,    You can   t leave. You  gotta to stay here now. You can   t leave outta here now.    And three days  later he was dead and I went to her funeral but they had moved the body,  buried in Mexico, where he was born. So that   s where his body is at.  Very good guy. Him and I worked together. I worked for him about  sixteen or seventeen years, maybe longer. Then I   ve been working for   inaudible  for thirty some years.  Has there ever been a time when you didn   t work?  Not really, because I started picking cotton when I was just a youngster,  and I used a tow sack and I shuttled back and forth to Momma   s sack,  and I   d go along with Momma and pick cotton and help her out. Then  after I got up big enough to pick, I picked by myself and then after I  married, I picked cotton   chopped cotton. We   d go out every morning  on the truck and chop and pick cotton, and then we   d go and cut broom  corn. You ever known of broom corn? They have a guy go along and  table it. You got two rows and you take, you go down and break it over  behind you and make it on the table like. Then we   d come along with a  little ole knife like that and you hold it like that and you cut the stalks  out. They   re about that long (gestures) and lay them up on that table.  They call that broom corn. They make brooms out of it and we did that  every year just about, until the cotton season opened up. So we were just  about helping the farmers all the time, until we went to work at the  compress.  We were working at the compress and when the Depression hit that   s  when time got hard and nobody couldn   t find a job. Hoover was the  president and he didn   t have no jobs he didn   t make no jobs. Everybody  was worried and hungry and finally they opened a soup line. Everybody  would go downtown to the soup line and carry their buckets, their pots  and pans, whatever, and get the soup. And boy, about the time you get  home and eat it, it   d run right out of you, right through you, like water.  And we couldn   t eat it and so I said,    I gotta find me a job.    So then  that   s when I went out among the white folks and asked them if I could  work in the yard, doing yard work, house cleaning, whatever, and that   s  where I made my living through the Depression. Yeah. Hoover didn   t  make no jobs and after Roosevelt   Roosevelt got in there and that   s  when the WPA started. We started working eleven days a month in the  WPA. You got twenty-six dollars and forty cents a month. Yeah, that   s  11  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  what we made and that was big money besides what we were making at  the compress and out in the field. Yeah. That was good times though.  They call that the good old days.  Well, in those good old days what did you do for fun?  Fun? Oh, we had fun. There were times when a farmer   s horse would get  down and we   d go help get the horse up and get him back on his feet,  and we   d walk down the fence line and we   d find a bush or two and pick  up a half gallon of white lightning. You know what white lightning is?  Yeah.  Corn whiskey, and they   d bring it back where the horse   d be laying  down, maggots been done got all in it, and they   d take and pour that  corn whiskey on that sore spot, and we   d stand there looking,  wondering,    What are they gonna do with all that whiskey? Pour it all  out?    He said,    Don   t worry. We   ve got plenty of it. We   ll have some to  drink,    and we drank white lightning. (Laughs) Yeah, and I drank that  until we started with bourbon. I tried bourbon but I didn   t like bourbon. I  tried scotch and I didn   t like scotch. I tried white horse scotch and didn   t  like it. So, they come out with vodka and I started drinking vodka, and I  must   ve drank vodka for sixty years. Yeah, finally I just give up  drinking. Ever once and awhile, when I go out or we have a party, I   ll  have a cocktail, something like that, but I never think of drinking and  smoking anymore.  I gave smoking up first. I was just sitting down there at 1227 Glenwood,  and my wife was still smoking, and I said,    You know what, I   m  quitting smoking.    She said,    You can   t quit that now    and I said,     Watch me.    I   d lay my cigarettes on the coffee table, and I   d get my  drink and sit there. I   d get a cigarette and out it in my mouth and  wouldn   t light it. Then I found out the cigarettes would cause me to have  the bad hangover. Just drinking alone, I didn   t have the hangover. Then  and I quit the cigarettes.  So, I drank until I was with my third wife, and finally I just gave it up  because every time she and I get to drinking, she always said I did things  that made her angry, and I quit. I said,    I   m gonna stay sober then I  know what I be doing.    A lot of the time she   d be fibbing on me and I  didn   t know it, because I was drinking. So when I quit drinking I said,     Uh huh, you lying. I didn   t do that. I know. I was sober.    (Laughs)  Yeah, but she end up with Alzheimer   s, and she passed away since I   ve  been here, about three years ago   yeah about three years ago. She end  up with Alzheimer   s, and she ended up alcoholic. I couldn   t live with  her. I had to move out. She called the law on me twice. I said,    That   s  12  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  enough. I   m out of here,    and I moved into here and I   ve been here ever  since. That   s about the life I went, yeah.  Well, if you smoked and drank, what do you attribute your long years to?  Well, I stay busy, working. I stayed busy working and I didn   t worry  about nothing, and I always kept a good attitude about life. People out  there worrying about things I said,    It don   t get you nothing.    My wife  used to worry about the bills, and she   d get behind. She took care of  them, but she   d get behind and she   d come to me and say,    Well, I can   t  catch the bills up. They   re getting out of hand.    I   d go to my boss man     I went to my boss when I was in Denver. His name was Dave S. Dave.  He said,    Well, I know what I   m gonna have to do. Bring all your bills  to me, and I   ll take care of them.    So, I took all my bills, carried them to  my boss man. He combined them, house note and all the bills that come  in, monthly bills, and he paid them for me and he gave me thirty-five  dollars a week. That   s what I made, and he paid all my bills. We was  getting paid once a month and if we just needed some money he   d  always advance forty or fifty dollars. He said,    Well, with me paying  your bills, all I can give you is thirty-five dollars a week.    My wife,  she   d end up being a nurse so she had two patients, and she was getting  like three hundred and some dollars a week for two patients. She was  bringing in the money, but my pay was taking care of the bills. So we  lived good. Yeah, we lived good. And that   s the way we did until she  passed away, I mean got sick, and then we moved back to Oklahoma.  Have you ever tried retirement?  Retirement?  Yes.  Yeah. I tried it and when it first happened, she and I tried it and she was  on disability. She could quit first, because she was on disability. She was  a practical nurse and she tried it and she said,    We might as well take it.     I said,    No, I didn   t have enough money coming in.    So went to the  social security office and they said,    You could sign up and get ready for  it, and when you get ready for it you can tell us and we   ll start sending  your check out.    So finally they told me, they said,    Ain   t you old  enough to retire?    I said,    I never really thought about it.    One of the  guys on the job kept pestering me about it and I quit. One Wednesday,  ten o   clock, I walked out. I said,    I   m out of here.    I went home and told  her,    Well, we   ll go to the social security office and start my money,     and they started me out at  650 a month. Then they would give me all  the back raises. I started at sixty-eight, and I had gone over three years,  because you can start at sixty-five.  13  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  I was thinking I would get three years back pay. So the lady working in  the office was a friend of ours named Amanda, like my mother, and she  took a liking to me. We was all good friends and she said,    Delmar, I   ll  get you your back pay,    and she said,    As far as I can get you is two  years back.    That was fourteen thousand dollars and I said,    That   s good  enough for me. I ain   t got nothing to worry about.    So she got me  fourteen thousand dollars plus my raises every year. I came to Oklahoma  and that   s when I bought that place over there. Yeah, back in    79.  And you went back to work though?  I went back to work. So then I went to work. We was going to the Senior  Citizen  Center  and they would have food. We played dominoes,  checkers, cards and we   d go out there, see. And I got to thinking,    These  people gonna make me old before my time. I   m outta here.    I told my  wife,    I   m going back to work.    I called my boss and he said,    Well, I   ll  put you back to work when you get here.    So I went back part-time with  him, and then finally I moved. It was after I moved he finally sold out to  Maaco. Yeah, Dave S. Dave, he sold out. He bought a home and lived in  the home for about five years, and he decided he wanted to move out in  one of those places where the rich people move, you know where you  don   t do nothing but you got your own home. They moved him on to  there but we still worked for him and he said,    When we make a million  dollars, we all gonna party.    One day he come back and said,    Well, I  hit the million  Nobody working any today. I   m setting up a party over  there at the bar. Everybody can drink and eat all day,    it   s on him and  that   s what we did. Drank and eat   we quit working. Drank and eat all  day on him.  Finally, she took sick and we moved back to Oklahoma, and I got with  Ron and that   s when I stayed with him until he passed away. Look like  everybody I know is gone--everybody, every woman I   ve known, every  girl, and every friend I ever had. I   ve seen so many people go. I had  friends, all the friends I had back in the    40s, all the friends I had when I  come back from the war, and all the friends I had   gone. I ain   t got  none of them. All new friends out here, all new friends. Out there on my  job at the racetrack, there   s nobody I know out there that come up with  me. Everybody   s gone. It   s kinda sad but, you know, that   s the way life  is. You can   t worry about it. You gotta keep on with your life and thank  God for being here, because boy, I know I   ve been a lucky man to keep  on going with all them people gone. My brother-in-law he passed away.  He was like ninety when he passed away. Yeah, I   m a lucky man to be  alive.  Well, how did you celebrate your one-hundredth birthday?  14  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  How did I celebrate? Well, my boss, when I hit eighty, he sent me, told  me I could go around the world   wherever I wanted to go, and I chose  to go to Las Vegas. (Laughter) I had drove a truck for him one year, for  sale, to Las Vegas, and I had never been to Las Vegas, and I drove that  truck out and I enjoyed Las Vegas. The only thing about it, I couldn   t  get a hotel room. I had to go in colored town, they called it, to get a hotel  room because white folk didn   t allow blacks in their hotels and things.  You could work for them but you couldn   t live there and so we had     black people had their own gambling, and they had their own places and  you could gamble out there. You could gamble on the sidewalk but you  couldn   t go in, and then when I went out there when my boss sent me,  they was taking us in the hotels because the people sold out to  foreigners, and the foreigners said,    Your money   s just as good as  anyone else   s. Come on in.    We started going in the hotels and started  having family reunions and stuff like that, and so we   ve been going to  hotels ever since.  Around the world though, and picked Vegas?  What?  You could   ve gone anywhere and you picked Vegas?  Yeah.  Did you go the long way around to get there?  Oh yeah. I drove first time. I drove a    38 Chevrolet and then I drove, I  had a little old Chrysler I drove, and then after I quit working I drove a  Cadillac. I drove a Cadillac and then we started to flying. We quit  driving and we started flying   cheaper and you get there much quicker.  (Laughs) We   d go out and stay about four days and after that you get  bored. Then we   d come home. Things went pretty good for us.  Did you participate in anything?  Most of the time I just used the machines. I didn   t know how to play  poker. I used to know but I give up poker and stuff like that. I just  played the machines. Hit a couple of good ones every once in a while.  Most of the time on the way back home when I hit one would be at the  airport. Good place because you would bring it all back. You   d leave  with it. (Laughs) Life   s been good to me.  Did religion play a role?  15  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Religion?  Religion? Church?  No, I joined the church through Oral Roberts. We had a semi-church  there and we all went up front and he prayed for us, and then you   d go  back in the back and he prayed for you, and then you   d come back out  and then we joined the church and signed you up, and that   s when I  joined the church. I   d go to church with my wife over there on Fifth  Street in Oklahoma City, and finally I just gave it up because I didn   t  like the way they were trying things. Nice preacher but the people, you  know, around there talk and I give it up. I haven   t been to church now in  years, but I still think of the man upstairs taking care of me. Yeah, and I  tell the people I won   t forget that.  Well, do you remember getting your first television?  Yeah I got my first television in Denver back in    54. I think in    54 or     55. Yeah.  What were some of the shows you watched?  Let   s see, we watched   can   t think of most of them shows. I can   t really  think of them. I remember them but I can   t think of the name of them.  Amos and Andy was one of them they had     Andy and  inaudible  and Babe Ruth, and the guy that had the big mouth  who would put four or five balls in his mouth. I can   t think of his name  and a couple guys out there I know. I couldn   t think of their name but I  remember them. Yeah. Then we   d watch a lot of shows on there where  they would be playing music, you know, black guys playing music     Count Basie, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard; something like that. Then  we   d go to the dances that they   d be playing and we   d go. Chuck Berry,  I remember him. I used to dance like he did. (Laughter) I   d get out down  on the floor and I   d jump, play the guitar, like I was playing the guitar,  and then I   d squat and walk from here to about that door. (Gestures)  We   d go out to the bar and we   d get to the door and we   d walk in and  my wife would be upright and I squatted down.    Where did he go?    You  know, they were looking everywhere, and I   d stand up.    How in the  world do you do that?    I couldn   t do it now. Oh, we had a lot of fun.  Yeah, a lot of black artists we knew. Ray Charles, yeah, we   d watch  him. We   d never miss them. When they come to town we   d always go to  see them. I know them in person, have a lot of their autographs, and one  of them, Roy Fulton, he grew up with my wife down there in Mount  16  Bishop  Hopkins  Bishop  Hopkins  Bishop  Hopkins  Bishop  Hopkins  Bishop  Olive, Oklahoma. They all went to school together down there. They  used to go out and he   d be sitting under a tree playing the guitar. He  came Denver and we were sitting down in the front and he saw and he  recognized us and come down and sit with us, drank with us during the  intermission. He told everybody, had us come up on stage, he was a  friend that growed up with us. A lot of them guys was nice. Things went  pretty good. Yeah.  Tell us about what you do today, for work?  Today?  Yeah.  Today, I went in and got there at seven thirty and went to work, and I  started cleaning and detailing trucks, because they were coming in there.  They was waiting for us to open up, and they was waiting to get trucks  to get out. As fast as I   d get one ready they   d move it and they   d bring  up another one. I detailed about six of them, and then they had a bunch  of them pads that I had to fold up and stack up and get them ready to go  out. I was there from seven thirty until about eleven fifteen, and finally  he said,    That   s it for the day.    That was the hot part of the day, too. It  was just getting hot out there, and I come out and got in the car and  came home.  I know that you work at the racetrack, Remington  Park  Racetrack.  What do you do out there during the season?  At the racetrack, I use a little old broom and a dust pan and you go  around sweeping up trash, tickets, trash, spills, and whatever. The guy  followed me with the TV. Every birthday he follows me. Wherever I go  he has the TV on me and then they help me down to the racetrack where  the horses come in when they win. I go down there to the winner   s circle  and they   d have me down leading the jockeys. That   s where they  announce my age and everything and give me my present. My boss man  gives me a present and tells the people how old I was and how long I   ve  been working and he says,    One of the best hands I   ve got is the oldest.     (Laughs) He said    He   s been with us now about eighteen years or  more.     And are you planning to work there again this season?  I already signed up for it. All I have to do is get there. Already signed  up, nineteen thirteen. Yeah, just waiting. Can   t hardly wait.  So how many months or weeks do you work?  17  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  We work about ninety days, or something like that. Ninety days     thoroughbred and I think it   s about seventy or eighty days in quarter  horse. So, quarter horse, they run a little short distance. Thoroughbred,  they go all the way around the track. Yeah.  Do you do full days or half?  Full days. Yeah.  Full days.  I go in at five thirty in the evening and work    til quitting time. The last  race is around ten thirty, and by the time I clean up and get everything  up to par it   ll be around eleven thirty, maybe midnight, and then I come  out and get in my PT Cruiser and cruise on in to Norman. I get into  Norman about thirty-five minutes after I get off, more or less. I can drive  it thirty-five, forty minutes because there wouldn   t be no traffic out  there. I just have to stay with the speed limit. Other than that I could  drive a little quicker. (Laughter)  I did try that and the highway patrol stopped me. (Laughter) Police  stopped me going about Twelfth Street here. I was coming about eighty-five  he said, and I was catching every light. I   d see the light and I   d  speed up and it   d turn green and I   d go through it and if it turned red, I  slowed down and when it turned green I would shoot through it. He was  sitting over there and I said,    Oh my God, there   s the police.    I acted  like I didn   t see him. I was just cruising right along, looked over and  here he come and I pulled over and stopped. He come up and he said,     You got a license?       Yeah.    Can I see them?        Yes, sir.    I pulled it  out and he said,    Mr. Delmar, what   s the speed limit here?       Oh, fifty-five.        Oh no, no. You   re talking about over there. It   s fifty here. You  know what you were doing?       No.       You was just cruising along,  paying nobody no attention, just cruising on. Eighty-five.       Was I  driving that fast? It didn   t seem like it.       That   s what you were doing.     He said,    You got insurance?    I said,    Yeah.    He said,    While you   re  getting your insurance out I   m gonna back here. I   ll be right back.    He  went back and opened the door. He stood there and he looked around  and I said,    Oh my God, here goes  300 dollars out of my pocket.    He  shut the door and he come back, and he didn   t have no book or nothing.  I said,    Wonder what he   s gonna do now?    He said,    You know what?  I   m gonna let you go.       Are you kidding?       Nope, I   m gonna let you go.  Where are you going?    I said,    I   m going to the racetrack. I   m going to  work.    He looked at my license again and,    Is that your age?       I said,     Yeah.    My age on there was 100, because I was born in 1913 instead of  18  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  1908, and he said,    What do you do at the racetrack? And you   re a  hundred years old and driving?    I said    Yeah, I have no problem with  that. They laugh when I go in to get my driver   s license.    He said,     Yeah, will you do me a favor?    and I said    What   s that?       Try to stick  with the speed limit.    I said,    I will,    and I do. I respect that.  When I go through there every once in a while I see him and I wave at  him. Everybody   s passing me but I ain   t going to jump up there.    He   s  probably watching me, on my tail, and he ain   t gonna let me go this  time.    (Laughter) So, he learnt me a lesson and I stick with the speed  limit, even when I   m out there by myself and I know there ain   t nobody  around. Every once in a while maybe I get above it, and then after you  get through Moore, you can drive up to seventy, and so I hit the seventy  mark. Sometimes I look down and I   m up to eighty, but I jump back on  seventy. Yeah.  That   s when you set the cruise control.  Yeah. (Laughs) Well, I put it on cruise control most of the time, and I  just drive and just do the sixty.  Do you have to wear glasses?  No.  That   s amazing.  Yeah, I can read about anything on the paper that I want. I got one bad  ear here. I don   t hear too good out of this ear here. It ain   t all the way  bad, but I went and had it checked. I was gonna get a hearing aid and she  said it wouldn   t do that much good and said it wasn   t that bad but it   s  gonna get worse. It ain   t gonna get no better as I get older. I said,    Well,  I probably won   t be around that long,    but I   m still here. (Laughs) And I  thought I wouldn   t need no dental work, but I   ve been getting dental  work now for about five years. My son told me,    You gotta get your  teeth fixed. You   re coming out here.    So he carried me to his dentist in  Menlo Park, out in California. So I   ve got to go back out there in  September. I got one bad tooth here that   s gonna have to come out, holds  my plate. They   re gonna have to fix a platform for the roof of my  mouth. So I have to go out and get that. My dental work, I   ve been doing  it all out there in California and I go out every year.  My daughter-in-law, she wants me to go to get my toenails and then go  to a place to get my fingernails. So she pays for all of that, and then most  the time she   ll pay for my fare out there. She   s got a lot of money. She  worked for  Lockheed Martin  or something, and she did a lot of  19  Finchum  Bishop  Hopkins  Bishop  Hopkins  Bishop  Hopkins  traveling back and forth all over the country, Denver mostly, and she  retired almost a millionaire. She lacked about that much, she said, being  a millionaire, and if Bush and them hadn   t messed up things when they  was in there and all those people lost money   I lost eighty thousand  dollars myself on the money market and she lost a bunch of money. It   s  coming back and didn   t quite make it, but with the money she had in the  bank and credit unions, she had over a million dollars, and so she spends  it freely. Every time I go out there, they buy me a bunch of clothes. I got  clothes in there. She bought seven shirts for me. Seven   how am I  gonna wear seven shirts.  One a day   One a day.  I go right back here and I got two shirts in there now, cowboy shirts, I  need to unwrap, and she said,    Bring them out when you come out.  We   re going to so and so   s.    Carried them out and never even  unwrapped them. I got clothes I ain   t never touched because I ain   t  gonna be going to no place that much. Bought these shoes   my son he  liked to buy antique stuff and he went out buying antique stuff and then  he bought some stuff   An African made them and you buy them and he  gets so much money when you buy them, and she come back,    Try them  on  Can you wear them?    I said,    Yeah.    Do you like them?    I said,     They   re okay.       They   re yours.    (Laughs) She bought me a pair of  them about a year ago. I was out there and she bought me a pair of work  shoes and dress shoes. I said,    I don   t need no shoes.    I got shoes in  there I ain   t ever gonna wear. I got boots   about fifteen pairs of boots in  there, cowboy boots, because I love boots. They   re just lined up by the  window there. I don   t wear them no more, but they   re there in case I  ever want to. Yeah, she   s seen them.  Some folks your age tell us they have a motto or a philosophy they live  by in life. What   s your motto or philosophy towards life?  Model?  Your motto?  Motto. Just to stay happy and to be happy. Keep a smile on your face.  Kiss the angels good morning and let them know you   re thinking about  them when you   re gone, and love her like the devil when you get back  home. (Laughs) I got that off a tape of mine. Well, it   s true. An old man  told me how to stay happy. I think I mentioned it to you. He told me, I   ll  be walking down the street going somewhere, he was sitting on the  church step and he called me over.    Hey boy       they always called you  20  Bishop  Hopkins  Bishop  Hopkins  Bishop  Hopkins  Bishop  Hopkins  boy back then      come over here,    and I went over.    Are you happy?       I  think so.    He said,    Why do you think so?    I said,    Well, I guess       He  said,    Do you want to be happy?    I said,    Yeah, I   d like to be happy.     He said,    I   ll tell you what you do. You whistle or sing every day before  ten o   clock, and I guarantee you will have a good day.    And I tried it  and right now I do that. I still think about that fellow. It made my day  and that was the best thing that ever happened in my life and it is so true.  You can be happy if you want to. It   s up to you.  It   s almost up to you to live a long time, whether you know it or not. My  doctor told me,    You know the way to live the life and you know how to  live and you have spent your life the way you are. If you hadn   t done  that, you   d be dead. You know when to quit smoking. You know when  to quit drinking. You know when to start running around. You know  what to eat. You know how to make your life and live a happy life and  as long as you do that you might live another ten years. Who knows?     Yeah, and when I go to him to get the medicine he says,    I can   t find  nothing wrong. You   re in perfect health. All you   ve got is the little  problem with your ear.    I have arthritis in my shoulders and hands but I  don   t let that stop me. I keep on moving. I do my thing.  And when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  What do I want it to say? Just tell them I   m a happy-go-lucky guy, and  I   ve been that way all my life. I growed up that way. My brother had  problems but I didn   t. He was next to me and every time I looked up he  was crying. Wasn   t nothing right. I said,    You gotta make things right,  and if it ain   t right, don   t worry about it.    The good always outweighs  the bad. Just hang on and it   ll pass through. Catch on and keep on living.  That   s what I do, and I don   t worry about it. I just hang on until it  changes and I know change is coming. Sure enough, wake up the next  morning to a bright sunshiny day. Made my day. Yeah. So, I say be-happy-  go-lucky. Take it day by day.  So you were a child when this man told you?  What?  You were a child when this man told you to be happy?  Yes.  Do you have a song that you hum?  Yeah, I always sing some of the songs I heard the people sing in church  back then. I sing some of the songs I hear the artists I go to, like Chuck  21  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Berry or Ray Charles. Conway Twitty, I always sing his songs like,     Hello Dolly, how you doing? It   s nice to see you. It   s been a long time.  Yeah, just as lovely as you used to be.    I always sang that. Then I   d sing  one from Charlie Pride,    Kiss an angel good morning and let her know  you   re thinking about her when you   re gone.     Sing one for us   Huh?  Sing one for us.  (Laughs) I used to sing real good but I gave it up.  Oh, just a little something.  Ok, kiss an angel good morning, let   s see, how that go? I can sing, I  Can   t Stop Loving You.  (Singing)    I can   t stop loving you. It   s useless to say for I can   t live my  life in dreams of yesterday. Those happy hours that we once knew so  long ago, still make me blue.     So there you go.  That   s very good. Thank you.  Sometimes I   ll be here by myself and I can   t stop singing. (Laughter) I  just get to singing and I   ll sing all of Ray Charles and Chuck Berry. I  love Conway Twitty. I think he was one of the best   him and Clint  Black. I love Clint Black. So them guys, they kept me going. They made  my day like I make other people   s day.  A young man out there on the job told me, he said,    Delmar, you know  why you   re living so long?    I said,    No, I have an idea.    He said,    The  Lord has got you here for a purpose.    I said,    What do you mean?    He  said,    You inspired me. When I heard about you, I had to see you    and  he came down and saw me and he told me. He said,    The reason you   re  living as long as you   re here is because of what you did for me.    I said,     What?    He said,    You made me see the light.    He said,    I wanna be  like you. I wanna keep on living.    He said,    And that   s what you   ve  done around   everybody around you wants to be like you; wants to  touch you, wants to see you because you make them feel good about  life.    I guess he had a point there. Yeah and that   s what the people tell  me.  22  This lady come from way out of town and said,    I saw you on TV.     They had me on all the TVs and they said,    I told my husband I got to  see that man. He   s still working at 103. I gotta see him.    She said,    I  would   ve bought you something but I wouldn   t know what to get you  but I got a card and I put a little something in it.    I think she put forty  dollars in it. She said,    I just wanted to give you something.    I saw her  coming and looking at me and I said,    What   s she wanting?    and she  kept coming at me, and I moved over and she moved over. She walked  up,    You Delmar?    I said,    Yeah.    She said,    Can I hug you?    I said,     Help yourself.    (Laughter) And she hugged me and we stood there and  talked awhile. She said,    I want another hug    and we hugged again.  Then she said,    I thought I   d leave the card over there with the  gentleman, but he told me I   d find you around here,    and so she did.  That   s the way they do.  They come in and I   ll be walking along not even thinking about it and  somebody will touch me, and I   ll look around and they   ll be handing me  money. I go out there to California, and like y   all wanted me to sing,  they ask me about my life and what made me live so long and what was  my secret. They had me up on stage and I told them I really didn   t have  a secret. I just live day by day and be happy, and they tell me,    Well, we  wanted to give you something.    They gave me  300 that time. Yeah,   300 in a little envelope, and when I walked out he handed it to me. He  said,    Don   t open it until you get home.    I opened it and there was  300  in it. So they always give me money out there too.  Then I go out   I got a friend of mine. He   s eighty   no he   s seventy,  seventy-eight and he owns a barber shop where I go get my haircut, and  he wanted me to walk with him because I was a hundred years old. He  walked from his house across the bay to his barber shop, which is about  twelve miles, and he wanted me to do that walk. I said,    Yeah I can do  that,    and so I walked with him and then when we got to the barber  shop, people were there with the cell phones and videos and things  saying,    You mean to tell me this man walked twelve miles?    I said,     No, not really.    He said,    How   d you beat them home? Beat them  here?    I said,    I   m a fast walker.    (Laughter) I walked for a piece and  then my son picked me up. (Laughter) I cheated a little bit and come  around the back way and when they got there I went down and meet  them and come on up. I finally told them what happened because they  couldn   t believe me going that fast. I tell you, it   s fun there.  It   s fun out there. I go back every year and walk with him. I went back  last year and walked. I got off the plane and they   d already started and I  joined them. Got off the plane and went and got a haircut and then went  and joined them and walked back to the barber shop. (Laughter) They  think I am quite a guy. They can   t believe me. Oh man, they   re all so  23  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  happy when they see me coming. They tell my daughter-in-law,    Is that  good looking dad-in-law of yours coming back out?    They said,    We  want to see him.    I told them,    I don   t think so,    and she said,    You got  to come back out. All of your fans are watching and looking for you.     She said,    They   re all looking for you now,    and so I go back every  year. I got to go back out anyway for my dentist. I go back out to check  with him.  See, you   re a celebrity.  Huh?  You   re a celebrity.  Yeah. (Laughs) Yeah, he got me on there. He had me in the shop there  and a lady come in. She was eighty or ninety, and she was telling him,    I  guess I   m the oldest person you ever worked on    and he said    Wait a  minute. I got somebody here you need to meet.       Who is it?       This man  is a hundred and three years      a hundred, I was a hundred and one then.  She come back and saw me and she couldn   t believe it, and    Still  working?       He   s working two jobs and still driving,    and she said,    Oh  my God.    She stopped with that. She said,    I ain   t never gonna tell  nobody I   m the oldest no more.    Every time I go out he has people come  in and see me. He gives me a big discount because he takes pictures of  me with my teeth before he fixed them and then afterwards. He uses that  and he gives me a discount so he works with me and I works with him. It  makes it good. Other than that, it would cost me an arm and a leg to go  way back out there. Yeah, but it don   t cost that much for him. He   s  retired and he comes out and tells them what to do and how to do it and  then he checks all the dental work after it   s done.  It   s who you know.  Yeah.  Alright, I think we   re done for the day.  Ok then. I   m glad to be a help.  I thank you.  Thank y   all.  -------  -------
