Aday Oh yeah   Cooper Did you know our daddy built a quilting frame that you could run up  the wall and just work on that right at the front.  Aday It would roll as she   it would roll up.  Cooper Yeah and when you got that part quilted you could just roll it up and  it   d go on up the wall. Then another place would come out. He made it.  Finchum That   s pretty handy.  Cooper Dad was handy. He went to the fourth grade.  Finchum He   s the one that had the gristmill.  Cooper Oh yeah, he   s the one that had the flour mill, the gristmill, and he made  the flour you know. I just wish you could   ve seen that machine.

Cooper He was, absolutely. Dad was a smart man. He really was. The neighbors  would like to come down and talk with Dad. We had two or three  neighbors. One lady neighbor that lived back over here and when she  wanted some information on what to do about certain things, she come  down and talked to Dad about it. He   d tell them. He helped a lot of  them, you know, just be nice and good to them.  Finchum During the Depression did he treat customers in a special way or  anything during the Depression?  Cooper Yeah.  Finchum Let people charge?  Cooper Yes.  Bishop What was the Depression like? Do you remember that?  Cooper Depression, right?  Aday The farm people had it better than the city people in the Depression  because we raised everything that we eat. Our family was lucky enough  to have the flour mill, so we didn   t have to buy flour   just sugar. Sugar  and coffee and tea was the main things.  Cooper We raised a great, big garden, always.  Aday Yeah, Mom canned in half-gallon jars.  Finchum And you were about thirty when you got married?  Cooper Yes I was. I was an old lady.  Finchum You were for those times.  Cooper Yeah.

She   d get in there and put on  one of my gowns, and she   d come through this door just a running and  he   d catch her and put her way up high and catch her  (Laughs) That  was a big thrill to her. Wasn   t it honey?  Chaffin Mhmm, it was. It sure was.  Cooper We   ve had a wonderful life.  Finchum It sounds like it. Over the course of your life, what do you think   s been  the biggest invention, where you   re concerned?  Cooper Let   s see     Finchum Refrigeration, or electricity, or computers, or     29  Cooper I presume it would be electricity because that give us light all over the  house.  Aday Before electricity came our way, Dad had a Delco system of batteries.  Oh gosh, I guess that was probably seventy or eighty batteries in that  garage.  Cooper Yeah.  Aday It kept the lights and the refrigeration and everything     Cooper Carbide is what it   s called.  Aday    that we needed.  Cooper It was a big old round thing that stood way up.

Cooper Oh yeah, that was in Sulphur.  Bishop Can you talk a little bit about that?  Cooper When we went to Sulphur for a week. I think I told you that we lived in  that big old tent. Yeah, that was when we went to Sulphur and stayed a  week. One of the little girls, neighbors, that was there in that park, she  come out and we got to be friends. We was stiff starching. Do you  know what stiff starching is? You catch and hold hands, and you go  around, and around, and around, hip, hop, hip, hop, hip, hop, you know.  That little dog seen me doing that and it ran up behind and bit me.  Jumped up and bit me right on you know what  (Laughter) So they run  me to the doctor right quick to see if it had done any harm or if it had  rabies or what and it wasn   t. But anyway, I had a little experience.  (Laughs)  Bishop Did you have to have stitches or anything?  Cooper Huh?  Bishop Did you have to have any stitches or     Cooper Not a thing.  Bishop Not a thing.  Cooper Not a thing.  Bishop He wanted to play too. He wanted to play that game too.  Cooper Oh, yeah I guess. He was jumping up at me.

Then I go in and I fix  me a cup of coffee and sometimes I   ll have sausage and eggs, and  sometimes I   ll just have toast. Just something small for breakfast.  Bishop What are some of the activities you do during the day? The things you  do.  Cooper Well, I usually   well I run to the mailbox and get my mail and all that.  Aday Make up her bed.

Cooper Lin just don   t want me to, she   s afraid that I   ll have an accident.  Bishop Do you have a motto or a philosophy you live by in life?  Cooper I guess it would be a motto. I just want to be a person that   s liked by  everyone, and I want to do for others anything I can do for them. Just  love them, love people. I love people.

(Laughter)  No, that I try to be a good person   I tried to be a good person.  Sometimes it probably don   t work, but I know that   s an important thing  for life.  Bishop If you had to give advice to anybody that wanted to live 100 years, what  would it be?  Cooper Trust the Lord as their Savior. Be a Christian, and trust him in  everything, that you go to him for everything that you want, that you  know that he   s going to answer for you. You don   t have to know,  because if you ask him, he   s going to answer it for you and everything.  It just means so much to know that he   s in your life and you can have  him every day, every night.  Finchum You still go to church I take it?  Cooper Yes   well, I haven   t gone in several Sundays. We all go to the same  church at     Aday Union Valley.  Chaffin Union Valley.  Cooper    Union Valley.

Her husband, he   s a wonderful person. We   re so happy  that she got him.  Chaffin We   ve only been married since August. I was single twenty-nine years,  so it was kind of a shock to them. (Laughter)  Cooper They come over here and our pastor was with them and his son and Lin  and we was all sitting here at the table. He said   was it Brother Randall  that said,    Lin   s got something        Chaffin No, I said Randall   s got something to tell y   all. He said,    I   m not telling  them anything     (Laughter) It was a whirlwind romance  Cooper Lin sat there and she said,    I   m going to get married.    (Laughter)  Chaffin I wasn   t sure how they   d take it. I knew they liked him, but like I said, I  hadn   t even dated in twelve years.  Cooper We knew the guy she was getting engaged to because he   s a preacher.  He preaches in other churches if they want him and he preaches in our  church. The church down here.  Finchum Been a pretty good life it sounds like. Well, anything else you want to  say before we close?  Cooper Well, I don   t know. I want to be the Christian the Lord wants me to be.  If he wants me, whatever he wants me to do, that   s what I want to do. I  know that he   ll be with me, whatever it is. Just rejoice in the Lord and  pray for others that they   ll get the Lord in their hearts.  Finchum Thank you so much for sharing with us today.  Cooper Oh, I was glad to give you what little I give you, Hon. (Laughs)  Aday We do appreciate the both of you.  Finchum It   s great.  -------  -------
