They went over there and they put in a grocery store and  a lumberyard and stayed two years. Them people over there, they didn   t  want you to get up the ladder. They wanted you to stay in their class. It  9  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  was   they was pretty rough.

How long did it take you to get back?  About a week probably. (Laughter) I know one time over east here it  rained, and I thought we were not ever going to get up that hill.  Pulled by two horses or     Two horses.  Two.  Yeah, and they had an extra one or two along.  That must have been hard traveling with three little boys.  Yeah. We walked a lot, just monkeying along, you know. Horses don   t  travel very fast and it wasn   t hard to keep up them.  And you remember that?  Yeah. Then I remember them old farmers a helping us along the way.  Yeah.  Good times I guess?  Yeah. We   d cook outside and, you know, like that.  Did you use a Dutch oven stove?  Yeah   no, a big kettle.  A big kettle.  Yeah, yeah it was a big kettle. Build a fire under it and yeah.  What did you usually eat?  Oh I don   t know.

Yeah, we had a cow.  That traveled     Yeah.     behind the wagon?  Yeah. Yeah.  So when you got back did he farm then, or do something else?  Yeah, he went into farming over there around Quinlan.  Did you have chores?  Well, no not really.  Didn   t have to milk the cow before school?  No, not then. Then later on when we moved down there where I   m at  now we had to get up and milk them cows before we went to school.  Did they have a dairy or just a few cows?  No, just milked about eight or ten cows.  Well did your mother have a big garden?  Yeah, she didn   t do it, but she helped. We kept her busy cooking.  And washing clothes.  Yeah. Yeah.  Well when you got out of high school, what did you do?  Well, I worked around different places and then I kept farming.  Were you in the military?  I was in the Navy for about four years. I volunteered. You know they  had that draft board. A lot of these women, their boys, they   d get drafted  11  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  and they   d all say,    Well where   s Herman at? Why ain   t he in here?    I  said,    Well, you aren   t going to pull that on me,    and I just went down  and volunteered.  And volunteered for the Navy. What did you while you were in the Navy?  Well, I was mostly stationed on land all the time.  Here in U.S?  Well, out there in the Pacific on Johnson Island.  Johnson Island.  It   s way off southwest of Hawaii.  Okay.  It was more of a   kind of a sub lookout island what it was. Had a couple  planes that they patrolled the ocean out in there, with them planes.  What year was that? What year     Well it was in    42   well after    41 and    43.  So part of the war? World War II?  Yeah. Yes.  Did you see any combat?  No.  Do you remember Pearl Harbor?  Oh yeah, I was home when that happened. It was on a Sunday. Yes.  And how did you hear about it?  On the radio.  The farm had a radio?  Yeah. Yes.  Battery or   well, you wouldn   t have had electricity. Well, did you have  12  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  electricity then?  Yeah, we hadn   t had it too long.  That was a happy day, too, when you got electricity?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got the dickens over that. Out east of  town here, I was farming. I had a place out there rented. I had wheat on  it. It was about ready to cut. They was going to put that line in to  Quinlan, and they wanted to get in here and wallow down about forty or  fifty feet of that wheat. I said,    No, you   re going to wait until I cut it,     and boy those people was mad over there at me, but they wouldn   t have  paid me for it.  No.  I said,    Well, when I get it cut you can go after it then.    They had to  wait.  Well good for you.  Yeah, yeah.  Huh    So the house where you   re living in now, you   ve lived in for a  long time?  Well yeah. It   s been built on, and it was just a two-roomed house when  we first moved down there.  Okay. So your parents owned it first?  Yeah.  Then it came down to you.  Yeah, yeah.  Were you ever married?  Nope.  Come close?  Well a lot of times. (Laughs) Hell, I didn   t   well I was kind of engaged  to a gal when the war broke out. All of a sudden she wanted to get  married and I said,    Well, let   s just wait    til it   s over with, because I  13  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  don   t know what   s going to happen.    Then I got a letter from her in  about, oh, eight   maybe eighteen months. She said,    I   m a getting  married.    I said,    Well, I can   t stop it.    So if that   s how she was, I  thought,    I   m glad I got rid of her.     Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah. Well during those four years that you were in the Navy, did you  get to come home any?  Never   Never?  Not    til it was almost over. I got a thirty-day leave. Then I didn   t get my  thirty-day leave on the East Coast. They said,    Everybody east of the  Mississippi got thirty days,    in boot camp. The rest of us was going to  get it when we got on the West Coast. We got way out there and they  forgot about it, but I did have a good trip going from West Virginia, a  Navy base, clear to California. We got on a troop train, and there was  sleepers on that. Had two beds, one above the other, and we had a diner  on there and I remember them big old hams so I had ham for breakfast.  (Laughs) It took it quite a while. We went clear down through Carolina,  and down to a bridge at New Orleans, over the river, come back up to  Fort Worth, and went from Fort Worth to out in Arizona. Then from  there on, up into San Francisco. Took us about a week. (Laughs)  Is that the first time you   d been on a train?  No, I rode on a train when I was four years old. That   s where   I went to  Wichita and I had my adenoids and tonsils taken out. Yeah.  The return trip wasn   t fun then was it?  No. Well, I remember   I can name every one of them towns from  Wichita to over here, to down here.  Well let   s hear it.  Yeah, I could. I could name every one of them.  At four years old?  Yeah. I remember that old guy on one of them places, we stopped and he  14  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  had that Wichita Eagle. He kept a hollering,    Get your Eagle  Get your  Eagle     I thought maybe he had a live bird out there. (Laughter) The old  cuss was selling papers. Yeah,    Get your Eagle      I know in 1918, 1919, through there, influenza was big. Did that impact  your family any?  Oh yeah. Well, nearly everybody had that influenza. Yeah.  Who did the discipline in your family? Your mom or your dad?  Well, probably both of them.  Did they need to do it very often?  No.  No?  No.  Was church an important part of your childhood?  Was what?  Church?  No, not really. My mother was a Seventh-Day Adventist. That was the  way she was raised. My dad was a Baptist.  So they didn   t make you go every Sunday or every time the church was  open?  No.  Do you remember anything about World War I? You would have been a  child.  Little bit. My granddad was in World War I. No, he was in the Civil  War. He was in the Civil War. They got captured. He was in a stockade  and they were about to starve to death. Him and another guy dug out,  and they got out. Then the government guys caught them, and thought  they was deserting, but they wasn   t. They was out stealing some food  because they was about to starve them to death. So they arrested them  put them in   it   s in Washington up there, have a big old article about it.  They had a trial and then it wasn   t what they thought it was. It   s on  15  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  record that they was still citizens.  What was his name?  Sammy L. they called him, Samuel Harper.  Samuel Harper.  Yeah. He was a pretty good sized guy.  And then World War I would have been your father   s generation?  Yeah. My dad was just at the right age that he didn   t get drafted in  World War I.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, when you got out of the Navy     Yeah.     how did you get back to Oklahoma?  Well, we   they had a troop train. I was in on that first draft that they     was eligible to get out. You know, they had a draft. They rated them. I  was in that first bunch. There was a big old   must have been 250 guys  out there in San Francisco. They put us on the train and we went to Fort  Worth. That   s where we went, from Fort Worth to Oklahoma City.  That   s where I got discharged. They put our meal on there, had a diner,  and they put it on there. Then they fed us a lunch, and there was one old  Indian boy, he got drunk, before the train, before he got on there, and he  was still drunk on there. I was in charge of that diner   of the door,  keeping anybody out of there. He came up there and he said he was  going to get something to eat and I said,    No you   re not.    I had a  walking stick with me and I had it ready. He was going to force his way  in there and if he would   ve I   d cracked him with it. He finally went back  and sat down, but he was going to get something to eat. He was going to  get something to eat.  You had orders not to let anyone     Not to let anybody get in there. Yeah, and I stayed with them, them  orders. I got picked on a lot in this   officers and stuff like that in the  service.  16  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Why?  Well, I don   t know whether my name was easy to remember or what, but  they   I guess they figured they could depend on me or something,  because they sure picked on me a lot. One time it was about 250 men in  a deal. There was going to be kind of an inspection and march. I was in a  bunk that was just back two   about two of them four rows of men. I was  in the third row and that lieutenant was out there in front of us and he  yelled,    Harper, front and center     I was like,    What the hell did I do  now.    (Laughter) Well he made me lead that damn bunch of guys.  So it was a good pick, not a bad pick then?  Yeah, and I got   course I wasn   t long-legged like a lot of them, and I  got kind of got out of step and the old guy, he was there walking with  me, and he said,    Harper, get in step     (Laughs) Yeah. Crazy stuff.  Well, I want to know with farming, did you   how was   did you     We used horses altogether, until them rubber tires come out, and boy  when they come out, changed everything.  What about the Dust Bowl?  We was still down there. We   d tape the windows up and all that kind of  stuff. I know that cloud would come in on a Sunday. It looked like a  solid bank, and rolled in.  Did you have to change your farming practices after the Dust Bowl or  anything?  No, not a whole lot. That rubber tires coming on them tractors changed  more than anything. Yeah.  And you said you had horses, did you ever ride horses?  Oh yeah. Yeah, and I got kicked by them too. (Laughter). Yeah.  Do you remember their names?  Yeah. We had a couple of them. My dad bought two of them. One of  them was   oh what did they call him? One of them was Dick and that  Dick, he was an ornery one. You couldn   t trust him. I had a 100 pound  sack of brand on my shoulder, walking in, and I walked by and he   I  was just lucky that I was right up close to him when he kicked me. He  17  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  never got a lick in on me. He kind of more just would   ve been shoving  me. If I   d of been far enough he would of broke me in two. Yeah, he was  an ornery little dickens. (Laughs) But we had two six-horse teams we  farmed with.  Six horses at one time?  Yeah.  Wow.  When did you get your first tractor?  Well, It was   we got one of the first ones they got in in Woodward,  when they come in. It was     Before you went to the Navy or after?  No, afterward.  So late 40s, early 50s?  Yeah.  The one that   s parked out there that you use is   you said was a 19     Forty-nine. It   s a    49.   A     49. Was that the first one?  Well that   my brother bought that after the war. They had to put in, you  18  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  know, for  them  to get them. Well, my cousin was a dealer in Watonga.  He managed to get him a tractor. Yeah.  You said that tractor ran on propane?  Yeah, it was on gas when we bought it. We put it on propane. It   s been a  good old tractor. Used to do a lot of farming with it. One year, I had  about 150 acres of wheat drilled on Labor Day. Yeah.  You   re supposed to take the day off on Labor Day   Yeah, I know it  (Laughs) But I had that much wheat drilled that day.  There probably weren   t many days off farming?  No, you always find something to do.  Well, what were   what was Christmas and Thanksgiving like when you  were younger?  Well it was always pretty, very nice. We always had turkey or  something. Not very often, ducks. Mostly turkey.  Do you have any family rituals or traditions?  No not really, but we raised   generally raised a big garden.  Your mother did a lot of canning?  Yeah. Quite a bit, yeah.  Did you have to help?  No, I didn   t. Them other younger than me, they was the ones that had to  help.  You got out of that?  Yeah, I got out of that kitchen work.  Did you have chickens?  Yeah, we had quite a few chickens.  Whose job was it to slaughter them?  19  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Well, mine part of the time.  Did you have a method?  Well, generally you chopped their head off and put them in a brush pile  or something and let them flop it out. But one time we had a lot of those  White Rock chickens, big chickens. We made gentlemen out of them.  We took their, they got a little cord in there that makes them a rooster.  You take that first rib, and cut a little notch on it, and you take that out  of there. You get that out of there and it will make a capon out of them.  We kept a lot of them and thinned them out and then shipped them. They  get big when you do that to them. They shipped them up there to Kansas  City, and them old guys they wanted more of them. Yeah.  Shipped them by train?  Train, yeah. They made good meat when they done that to them. They  get big. They get big like a big old turkey.  Well, how did you learn how to do that?  Well, I think the county agent was the one.  Came and showed you how?  Showed you how, yeah. But once in a while if you didn   t get it done  right, well you would get what they call a    slip   . He wouldn   t turn out  very nice.  Would it end up     Being, well, he just   he wouldn   t do no good. He   d be just like an old  rooster. Yeah.  On the train, did you just take them to here in Mooreland or what?  Well yeah, we took them up here and they shipped them.  Does a train come through here now? Today?  Well, yeah   no. Them trains don   t. They done away with them. A little  while after World War II they quit running those passenger trains  through here.  I mean with your chickens, if you had to do them now. How would they  get to market?  20  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Oh, I don   t know.  By truck?  By truck probably.  Yeah.  Yeah. Well, I   d like to try that again someday. (Laughs)  We can round you up a few   Did you raise cattle, too?  Yeah.  What kind of cattle?  Oh, mostly shorthorn. Yeah.  And where would you take them to market?  Well, over here at Woodward. They had a big sale barn over there.  Take them by truck?  Yeah. They drove a lot of cattle down around and to the railroad. They  used to have a big stockyard and they   d bring them in there, and  generally on the weekend they   d   them cattle, the guys who   d come  bring them in by horseback. Maybe twenty-eight, thirty, maybe ten,  twelve, in a bunch, and put them on them trains and ship them.  You remember watching that?  Yeah.  Do you? Here in Mooreland or Woodward?  Well, I watched them guys that   d be taking them cattle. They   d be three  or four on horseback. Yeah.  Real cowboys     Yeah, real cowboys. Yes.  21  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Did you ever make a good profit off of your cattle sales?  Yeah. Only broke even one year and the only reason I did, I had a couple  of guys who was buying some cattle for me and they paid too much  money for them. And I just barely broke even and I thought,    There ain   t  no more of that. I   m going to do it myself,    and that   s what I did. I  bought all my own cattle. I usually fed yearlings, buy calves about 400  pounds and then grow them up and sale them in August. First of August,  first of September.  Well, I contracted my cattle a whole lot. I knew about what the market  was supposed to be and I   d get ahold of a buyer. I didn   t wait until the  run was on and then try to sale them. I said,    Hell, I   ll have mine gone  before that started.    Them guys,    How   d you do that?       How   d you do  that?    Well I said,    I just watched the market, knew what was going to  happen.    It happened the same time every year. It still does.  How did you watch the market? By the newspaper or television or what?  Yeah, by the newspaper mostly.  Newspaper.  Yeah.  How did you keep your records?  Oh, in my head mostly. (Laughs) Yeah.  Did you ever remember your first car or your first truck?  Yeah, we had an old truck we hauled wheat with. That thing would get  so hot we   d have to run up against a tree to get it to stop. (Laughter)  Was it a Ford, Chevy?  It was a Chevrolet. That old truck could just   that engine wouldn   t stop.  It got so hot.  How long did you own it?  Well, about three years. Yeah.  About finally gave up on it huh?  Yeah.  22  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  And your first airplane?  Do what?  Do you remember seeing your first airplane?  No, not really.  Well, when the Dust Bowl was going on, do you have any other  memories of that time period? When the dust was so     Well, I know it was pretty dry. Yeah.  Around here?  Well, yeah. We put up roots, and thistles, and sunflowers for livestock  feed.  Sunflowers and what?  Roots and thistles.  Thistles?  Yeah, them tumbleweeds.  Oh, that   s pretty rough   Yeah, cut them when they   re green, put them in a pit. Yeah.  And the cows ate them?  Yeah, they liked them. Yeah.  Thistles, thistles are...  Yeah.  Hurt. (Laughs)  Yeah.  They hurt   Yeah.  23  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  What about the Great Depression before the Dust Bowl? Do you  remember the Great Depression any?  Well, we didn   t seem like we had too much of a bad time with it. Of  course we was still using horses then.  It didn   t affect you that much?  No.  Helped being on a farm?  Yeah, when that rubber come along on those tractors that changed a lot  of things.  What did it allow you to do as a farmer?  Well we sold all them horses and bought a tractor.  Didn   t keep the horses?  No, we didn   t keep them. (Laughter)  Not even one?  Well, we kept two or three or four of them.  Just for fun?  Yeah, but there   s a lot of people that used horses when that rubber come.  I remember when I was a farming, we   d be out there with them horses  and I know a guy had a John Deere tractor. In that ol    boughten thing  he   d come up there, go down the fence, and then turn around and go  back. I thought,    How did that guy afford that anyway?    But he had that  big John Deere, had a John Deere, and he could pull a two-row lister  with it.  And it would pop?  Yeah, they   d go popping along. Popping Johnny he called them. Yeah.  Well, did you have to help neighboring farmers harvest their     Well, some. My dad, he always   well then, back then, they was a  cutting that wheat with a header and a header barge. My dad, he was  24  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  always stacking wheat. He   d cut and we   d stack, but I used to work in a  dang header barge when I was about ten, eleven years old. You get in  there and them old guys they   d say,    Herman, you work the barge. I   ll  do the driving.    (Laughs)  I bet you remember shocking wheat?  Yeah. Yeah. There was quite a lot of wheat bound then. Then they had  them threshing machines, and most of those was run by steam engine.  Big old long belt.  Did your family have one or one would just come through? Threshing  crews.  Yeah. One would come through. One year it got so wet, that those wheat  stacks grew green over the top. They had to use a hay knife to cut them  open so they could get to the wheat. We had a bunch of hogs, and they  found out where them wheat stacks was and they   d go there. They   d  clean that up all the way around it. Bottom of it, didn   t have no spoilage  because them hogs kept that clean. That   s where they was getting their  meals from. There was a lot wheat lost. They did have to take a   use a  hay knife to cut that stack open. It was so wet.  Well you mentioned county agents a little while ago. Do you remember  using them for any other things? The county agent.  No. One time   well, there was an old guy that lived up north here. He  had a bunch of chickens, and they was dying on him. The county agent  said he had to go up there and he wanted me to go with him and I went  up there with him. Them chickens, they had coccidiosis and that will kill  them, and that old farmer he said,    Now which side of the field was that  on?    (Laughter)  Well, when you were in your high school and a little bit later, did you do  any dancing or go to things like that?  Oh yeah, some.  Some?  A lot of times we   d go to a dance on Saturday night, but I didn   t drink  and do all that smoking and stuff like a lot of guys. Never did.  Just danced?

Were they trying to get your secret to living long and secret to     Oh, they always ask me that.     secret to farming?  Well, one thing   I never was married, (laughs) and that   ll do it. I   d say,  I never drank or smoked like that.  Didn   t smoke while you were in the military?  Nope.  No?  I could have a beer every day, but I   d trade my beer for a little ice cream  or something.  And no cigarettes?  No cigarettes.  So describe a typical day for you today, now. Like how early do you get  up and what do you do through the day?  Oh, around six thirty.  Then what do you do the rest of your day?  Well, I generally find something to do. I like to run that tractor, I know  that.  And you still get on it?  Oh, Yeah.  28  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  And you still drive?  Yeah.  A car or a truck or whatever?  Yeah. That   s what a lot of people   I   ll be somewhere and they   ll say,     Well how did you get over here?    I   d say,    Well, I drove.    They   d say,     Drive?     (Laughs)  Is it a stick shift or an automatic?  Automatic.  Automatic. How late do you stay up?  I generally  go after  The Ten O   clock News.  Do you still read the newspaper?  Oh, yeah.  Read anything else? Do you come to the library?  No.  Read any books or anything?  No.  Just stay up on the news?  Yeah, stay up with the news. You can read all that and I take quite a few  farm papers.  Okay.  Did you ever rely on the Farmer   s Almanac?  No. (Laughs). I   d look at it once in a while. Yeah.  How do you check your weather?  Well, on the radio, on the TV     Do you use a computer any?  29  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Do what?  Do you use the computer?  I don   t have any. Except for right up here. (Gestures to his head)  It   s up there.  I went to a physical. They had a physical over here at Woodward. They  had   they called them   something about the life and living or  something, but they give pretty a good physical.  Have you been pretty health conscious your whole life?  Well, yeah. I had all my troubles when I was about four years old. I had  typhoid fever, diphtheria, and measles, and all that kind of stuff.  Before you were even in the first grade?  Yeah, I remember when I had diphtheria. My mother and my aunt, they  got on top of me, on the bed. They had too, and grabbed my nose, and  had that big old spoon. They used a lot of castor oil then, and they   d give  me a big old spoon full of that. Hell, they had to choke me to get that  down. (Laughter)  What were some of the other remedies they would do?  Well, that was mostly all of it.  You didn   t tell them you were sick any more than you     No. There was neighbors   well, we went over to my grandparents and  their neighbors had two boys. They didn   t believe in doctoring. One of  them boys got sick, and he died pretty quick with that diphtheria. The  other neighbor found out about it and they said,    You   re going to take  that boy to town. You   re going to take him to the doctor now,    and they  made them take that boy, and they saved him. That   s where I picked that  diphtheria up. They   d come to my grandparents    house.  So Mooreland had its own doctor at that time?  Well, that was at Woodward. Yeah. Was out at Tangier when that  happened.  The doctor ever make any home visits?  30  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Bishop  They used to, yeah. Yeah.  What   s your motto in life?  Don   t let stuff get the best of you is one thing, and kind of be happy  along with stuff. Not worry about a lot of stuff, because there isn   t  anything you can do about it.  That   s a good motto.  Yeah.  And if history were written about you today, what would you want it to  say?  Oh I don   t know. Tell them I   m a pretty good guy, I guess. (Laughter)  Not hard to get along with. As long as they don   t try to tromp on me  why, I   ll go along with them.  Any regrets from not saying yes when OSU came knocking?  No.  No.  Is there anything that you have on your bucket list, anything you want to  do that you have never done before?  No, not really. I   ve been around a lot of places. I   ve been to the  Kentucky Derby, and been down in that Boulder Dam  now Hoover  Dam  out there, and I   ve been around through the Panama Canal.  What   s the one thing you   ve seen that in your life that   s been your  favorite place to visit or     Oh I don   t know. I had a pretty good time when I went to the Kentucky  Derby.  Who won?  I don   t remember now. That horse was supposed to win three times, but  it did win two. It was her second run when I was over there. The Queen  of England was over there that week, at that time. Yep.  Queen Elizabeth?  31  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Probably.  That was back in about 1982 or three. Yeah.  Well you   ve seen a lot of changes of lots of things, what   s been the  most     Oh, I don   t know.  Besides rubber tires.  I think medicine was a big change. Yeah.  Penicillin for one     Penicillin and   I used to get some boils sometime and I   d come here to  the doctor and he said,    Herman, are you allergic to sulfur pills?    I said,     No.    He put me on a whole seven days on sulfur. I never had another  boil.  Well, then it worked.  Yeah, I   m not allergic to any of that stuff. Sulfur, Penicillin, or none of  it. He did, he put me on sulfur and it cleaned it out.  Do you take any major medicines today?  No, I take one baby aspirin.  And that   s it?  I take a high-density pill from cherry seed. It   s supposed to help your  joints, lubricate your joints, you know, the gel in your joints. But that   s  all I take.  Seem to be working?  Yeah, I think it   s helping me.  Interesting.  I hurt my shoulder a long time ago, but it was bothering me. I went to  the doctor and he said,    You   re getting ready to have a heart attack.     That   s one sign of it you know. They got that old doctor out there and he  looked me over and all that stuff, and I never heard anything from him. I  32  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  called him in about two weeks, and he was out on the golf course. They  got him on the phone, and I asked him about my heart and he said,     There ain   t a damn thing wrong with your heart.    (Laughter) He had to  come from out there on that golf course.  So you   re in pretty good shape for 100?  Yeah, I went to one about three years ago, down to Oklahoma City and  them doctors all said,    Well you got the body of a seventy-year-old  man.    That   s what they told me.  Are there days that it feels worse than others?  What?  Do you have days when you feel like you   re seventy versus a hundred?  No, not   being 100 don   t bother me any.  What   s the biggest challenge to being 100?  Oh, what is?  Yes.  Well, watch what you   re doing. You can get in trouble awful quick.  I mean, your vision   s pretty good?  Yeah.  And your hearing   s pretty good?  Yeah. Pretty good.  And you can get around?  Yeah. I   ve got an ankle; I   ve got a brace on it now. I hunted for one of  them braces, but I was about twelve years old and I was hunting. Caught  a possum, and he went up a tree. Then, of course, it was hollow up there  where he went in and I climbed that tree. It was big like them down in  our yard, it wasn   t that big, but they get easy to climb. I climbed that tree  and I reached in there to get that old possum and I got him. Well, he got  me. Of course I turned loose all hold because boy, that hurt and I fell. If  that tree would have been smooth at the bottom, but I   d gone down right  down with it and I sprained that ankle. It   s bothered me some ever since.  33  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Lately it   s been worse. My ankle don   t set straight like it ought to. It sets  off a little bit.  Did you break it?  No, I just sprung it.  Just sprung it.  Yeah, and it   s a big sprung. I should   ve had it worked on right when I  had it done, but I didn   t.  Well did Mooreland have a baseball team back in the early days when  you were younger?  They had a football team.  Football, okay.  And they played baseball, Mooreland, the town of Mooreland, had a  baseball team.  Do you remember going to their games?  Oh some of them. I didn   t go to a lot of them.  Had to work too much on the farm, huh?  Yeah, had to be doing something.  Anything else?  And we got that North Canadian River down there and we could go  down there and go fishing in it.  That   s what you would do for fun?  Well, yeah.  Did you ever go hunting?  Yeah.  Possums   Possum, yeah. (Laughter)  34  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Finchum  Harper  Bishop  Harper  Finchum  Harper  What else would you do for fun?  Well, not a whole lot. In the winter time I used to skate some. We had  ice.  Ponds would get thick? The ice thick enough?  I skated on that river down there.  You wouldn   t do that today I don   t think.  No. It   s dry as a bone almost. (Laughs) It   s got a little bit of water in it,  but not very much.  Anything else you want to tell us before we shut it off?  No. I   m just thankful to be here, that   s one thing.  I   m thankful you   re here too, and I appreciate you sharing your stories  with us.  Yeah.  And I   m glad rubber   s here, too.  Yeah. (Laughs)     Rubber meets the road,    the old saying.  Yeah.  Those are big tires.  Yeah.  -------  -------
