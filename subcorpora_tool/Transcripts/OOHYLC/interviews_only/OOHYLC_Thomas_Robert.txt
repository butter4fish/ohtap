 Finchum  Today is September 30, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University and today we   re in  Tulsa, Oklahoma to speak with Robert Thomas   right? Robert Thomas?  Robert     Thomas.     Thomas.  Thank you for having us today. Let   s start with having you tell us when  and where you were born.  I was born in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, a suburb of Akron, and I was born  July 28, 1914. The day that Austria declared war on Serbia starting the  first World War.  What did your parents do for a living?  My father was an accountant with Firestone Tire and Rubber.  And your mother?  Well, she was a housewife.  And did you have brothers and sisters?  I had a younger brother and a sister, who is still alive, twelve years  younger than I am.  Did you live in town or out in the country?  5  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  No, we lived in town.  Where did you go to school?  I went to public schools in Cuyahoga Falls. After working two years  following high school, I went to the University of Pennsylvania in  Philadelphia, to the Wharton School of Finance.  Why did you decide to go there?  Well, in my two years of between high school and college, I worked for  a short while with Firestone, and my duties took me into the so called     Mahogany Row,    which was the offices of the vice president, the  president, who was John Thomas, a relative of my father, and Harvey  Firestone, the chairman. And I told my father one day that wherever I  went, I wanted to be in    Mahogany Row,    but not at Firestone. For the  reason that John Thomas had a son, Robert D., and I was Robert E., and  one payday I got his check and he got mine, and I learned that being the  son of John Thomas was worth a lot more than being the son of Talbot  Thomas.  A pretty important lesson I guess.  That   s right. I was accepted for the Wharton School. I was already a  trained accountant, and I went to three-hour exams as a freshman and  walked out in no more than forty-five minutes. I was able to graduate in  three years. My marks were such that I had unlimited cut privileges my  last two years, and I was exempt from all final exams my last two years.  So I went through the four-year course in three.  Pretty impressive. Did it take a lot of studying?  Not a great deal. I was doing some work for my uncle   s companies in  my last two years. One of things that I negotiated was the sale of one of  the companies to Armstrong Corp, a very profitable sale for my uncle. It  resulted in Armstrong Corp talking to me about coming there following  graduation. I never heard from them in a letter. I had told them that I   d  be available on June 15 because I had no final exams to take. So I went  to work over at Keystone Custodian Funds the first of June, in large part  because they met my salary requirements. In 1936, the going salary for a  college graduate was  125 a month, and I thought with all of my  experience I wanted a minimum of  200 a month and Keystone  Custodian Funds met it. I went there as assistant general manager. The  first year I actually earned over  300 a month.  6  The night of June 15, when I arrived home, I had a call from the vice  president of Armstrong Corp   how come I didn   t show up that morning.  I said,    Well, I didn   t show up because I never received any sort of a  letter, and I was tendered this job offer where they met my  requirements,    and one of my professors was particularly interested in  Keystone Custodian Funds. He urged me to go there. He was one of my  professors, Canby Balderston, who later on became vice chairman of the  Federal Reserve Board. I used to go and see him in Washington. He was  a professor that was very dry and typically fellows would get sleepy at  eight o   clock lectures. One day one of my classmates fell asleep and  Canby said,    Wake him up     and the fellow next to him said,    You wake  him up. You put him to sleep.    (Laughter)  Well, I stayed with Keystone until   Well, the war ended, and Keystone  had  125 million invested in railroad securities. They were only worth  about ninety and that was viewed as a very serious problem, and I was  dumped into the job of doing something about it. Well, in the process I  became known in New York Wall Street as the leading financial expert  on railroad finance. When an executive of Pennroad Corporation died,  which was formally a railroad holding company of Pennsylvania  Railroad, they still had about a half a dozen major railroad investments  that were viewed as a serious problem. They came after me. That   s when  I went to New York. I went to New York as a vice president. Well, it  was in 1955 that a fellow named Ed Claughton in Florida, died. To the  astonishment of people with his estate, he owned 75 percent of the  common stock of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, in hock at over  100 brokerage accounts across the country. He never reported it to the  SEC  Securities and Exchange Commission . He didn   t believe in that.  Anyway,    Cy    Lewis, a senior partner of Bear, Stearns    Company ,  got the job of finding a buyer. The first person they came to was me. I  ended up, along with a partner from Boston, buying the 75 percent. So  my initial demand to the president, Don Fraser, was I wanted four board  seats out of twenty-one and I expected to be named chairman. I asked  him to come to New York for dinner to talk about this. He said he  couldn   t get there by a railroad when I wanted him. I said,    Don, have  you ever heard of TWA  Trans World Airlines ?    (Laughs) He   d never  been an airplane  Well, I got him on a plane. Anyway, he came to have  dinner with me and they had to arrange their board, of course, to get four  resignations out of twenty-one. They had a board meeting in Houston  where they accepted the resignations and elected four directors,  including me. Bill Warren of Warren Petroleum, and who is the donor of  Saint Francis Hospital here, he made the motion to elect me chairman.  So I proceeded to run the railroad. I was forty-one years old.  I decided I needed some help after a year or two and I succeeded in  7  hiring another railroad president, who was a year younger than I, and  together we began to really overhaul things. We had offices in five  separate cities. One is outside of Houston, where we were tied up in the  courts for over a year, before we moved it to Denison, Texas.  The  Unions tried to stop the move out of  Parsons, Kansas. We had half of  the equipment on the train and half on the station platform when we  were stopped by union action in the courts. That wasn   t a big problem  because IBM  The International Business Machines Corporation   provided the equipment that we were missing. Bill Deramus was my  young president, a year younger, and I would talk practically every night  of the week. I lived in New York and he lived in Kansas City. We  decided when they tied us up in knots in Parsons, Saint Louis, was  scheduled to go two weeks later and we decided we   d move Saint Louis  one week later, and we did it on a Saturday night. We moved in twenty  moving vans around dinner time. By four o   clock  a.m. , every van was  loaded and successfully on its way to Denison, going east to Illinois and  not through Missouri.  Well, Monday morning all hell broke loose because the employees  arrived to a notice that everything had been moved and a special train  would depart Tuesday afternoon at five p.m. to take employees who  wanted to go to Denison and living accommodations would be provided.  Well, some went and some didn   t. The first thing that happened, we  were tossed out of the Chamber of Commerce. When Bill told me that I  said,    Wonderful  That   s going to save us about  25,000 a year.    Then  the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, the newspaper, wrote an editorial in  which they termed Bill a    bad apple,    and termed Bob Thomas    the  master criminal mind from New York.    (Laughs) Then it was rumored  that Senator Magnuson from Oregon was going to have an investigation  in Washington. I got on the telephone. I was a doing a lot of drilling in  West Texas, personally, for tax reasons. I called Ed Connelly, the  drilling operator who also happened to be the chairman of the  Democratic Party in Texas. I said,    Ed, I need to get to know Sam  Rayburn, the Speaker of the House, and Lyndon Johnson, the majority  leader in the Senate, in a hurry.     Well, three days later I was in Washington, and my first visit was with  Sam Rayburn in the Speaker   s office. When I was done talking to him  they took me into the bowels of the capitol building where Lyndon  Johnson had one of his several offices. When I walked into this office he  was sitting there with his feet up on the desk. (Laughs) He greeted me  not with any smiles or anything else, but he seated me down in the  corner opposite to his chair and fifteen or twenty minutes went by and he  hadn   t smiled, he hadn   t said anything. I thought,    Thomas, you got to  keep talking.    A few minutes later he smiled. He asked me some  questions, and the meeting was over. He walked me out through the  8  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  reception room on my right side, he was slightly taller, with his left arm  over my shoulder. When we got in the reception room and I was about to  leave the office, he said,    Bob don   t worry about this. Sam and I will  straighten it out.    Ten days in Washington and I saw one or the other  every business day. The final day just Sam Rayburn and Lyndon  Johnson together in the Speaker   s office and they explained to me what I  had to do to satisfy everybody. I assured them that it would be done and  it was.  Then Ed Connelly told me that I should figure out some way to thank  Sam Rayburn especially. The way we thanked him   his birthday was  roughly the same as the opening of Congress in January, and we began  the yearly   at the Mayflower Hotel we gave a dinner, cocktail dinner,  orchestra, dancing. We   d invite all the Texas congressman and their  wives, the two senators and their wives, and the governor. We did that  every year until Sam died and I got to know him very well. Later years, I  addressed him as Mr. Sam. You know, when he died I provided my  private  rail  car to take Harry Truman and Bess to the funeral. When it  was over, I went aboard to be sure that they were being taken care of and  they were. They were drinking our bourbon, and I had a bourbon with  them. (Laughter)  All of these politicians   did you ever have any political aspirations  yourself? Like running for Senate or president?  I have been asked to, but I turned them down. About the time Reagan  was running for president, I was asked if I would consider running for  president. My then about-to-be wife heard this conversation in our  airplane on a trip and she told me, when we got on the ground, if I had  any idea about doing that I could forget all about getting married.  (Laughter) So that killed that.  You chose marriage over politics.  And I   ve been asked to run for Senate, and so forth, in Oklahoma, but I  never really had any desire to be a senator or be president or anything  like that. I was satisfied with being president of MAPCO. You know, I  got this idea of the pipeline system, which became the basis of MAPCO,  when I had lunch one day in New York in    57 with the chairman of the  Missouri Pacific Railroad. He told me about this pipeline project that  Missouri Pacific and New York Central were debating. He said,    The  Missouri Pacific is going to do nothing with it, because the traffic  department is opposed. They don   t want to lose the tank car traffic.    He  said,    If you   re interested, you   re welcome to the idea.    I went back to  the office and I called Bill Warren. I asked him if he thought I   d be  wasting my time to spend any time looking at this project. Well, he  9  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  didn   t.  Then I called Al Perlman, the president of the New York Central. I saw  him eight o   clock the next morning. I   d known Al very   well, he was  executive VP of the Denver and Rio Grande when I knew him. He was  approached about the New York Central job, and I had dinner with Al  and his wife in Denver to talk about whether he ought to consider it. So I  knew him very well. When I told him about my conversation with the  Missouri Pacific chairman, and the fact that they handed me the project,  he was delighted, because he knew that the Missouri Pacific wasn   t  going to move on it. Anyway, the next thing I did, I called John  Williams, who I didn   t know. They were the pipeline contractor that was  involved in this oil project, and John was delighted that someone with  real interest would take it over.  We took it over and three years later we were successful. We had raised   72 million,  42 million we borrowed from a prudential, and  30  million we sold in public securities. We came out of construction with   6 million in cash, because I had a reserve fund of  3 million in the  budget. One of the investment bankers couldn   t believe that so to shut  him up, I raised another  3 million. We came out of construction with  6  million in cash and we began to expand right away. We were successful  in everything that we undertook. We grew up to be a Fortune 500  company in less than ten years.  What did MAPCO stand for?  Mid America Pipeline Company.  Is that what brought you to Tulsa then?  That   s right. At that time, as chairman of a railroad, I lived in New York.  I had an office in New York, an office in Dallas, and an office initially in  Saint Louis. When the pipeline was successful, I moved   decided since  most of our shippers were here in Oklahoma, that Tulsa would be the  place to put the headquarters. July 1, 1960, I moved to Tulsa.  By train?  No. By plane. (Laughter) Well, we grew very rapidly and we were  highly successful. We expanded in, among other things, into the coal  business. Our investment banker got the job of finding a buyer for a coal  mine in Kentucky  Dotiki Mine in Clay, Kentucky  that was owned by  several individuals. The major owner had had a heart problem and he  became very concerned because he suddenly realized that if he died, his  partners could buy him out at book value. The book value was minimal  10  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  because he charged off everything but the kitchen sink, and therefore the  book value, if he died, would cost his estate millions. We bought him  out for  12 million dollars in MAPCO stock, and it was a non-union  mine. It had a profit-sharing plan and one of the interesting things that  happened   shortly after we bought it, we had a profit-sharing plan  dinner for the miners and their wives, and I went to this dinner loaded  with slides of one sort or another and described what kind of a company  MAPCO was. At one point, I was telling about employees with their  service pins and I said to our treasurer,    Dean, stand up and show them  your service pin.    He stood up and he said,    I   m sorry Bob, I must have  left it on my pajamas.    That brought the house down. (Laughter)  We were able to make a success in the coal business because we were  non-union. We expected a day   s work for a day   s pay. Our miners  typically would make thirty to thirty-five dollars a man-day as compared  to a union miner, when they worked, making twenty or twenty-two, and  we expanded very rapidly in the coal business. We were able to pay  those wages because we got a man-day of work for a man-day of pay.  Our miners were producing twenty-five to thirty tons of coal a day as  compared to a union mine that maybe had fifteen, eighteen tons a man-day.  In terms of your success, who was a mentor? Was there anybody in your  life that kind of inspired you or was a mentor to you to be successful?  Oh I just had a desire to be successful. That   s all there was to it.  You talked about your, I think, uncle earlier. Was it Uncle Ray?  Yes.  How was he? Was he kind of an early motivator or     Absolutely. First place, he had two sons. The older son died of strep  throat in the mid    20s. My uncle had the same doctor in Philadelphia for  his son that took care of Coolidge   s son when he died of a strep throat.  His other son, his younger son, was sort of   well, my uncle didn   t think  as much of him as he thought of his older son. When I went to the  Wharton School I lived with my uncle and I had Dick   s room and he sort  of treated me as an older son.  Was this your mother   s     Mother   s brother.  Mother   s brother. Was he a business man, too?  11  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Jeanne  Bishop  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Oh yes.  What kind of companies did he run?  He was a road builder, and companies related to road building materials.  He was also a yachtsman. He taught me navigation and when the war  broke out, I tried to get a commission in the Navy based upon my  navigation and other experiences. I was turned down because I was told  I was worth more as a taxpayer. (Laughs) Jeanne   s father was turned  down for the same reason. (Laughter).  Pays to be smart.  Yeah.  So did you ever get a check that was bigger than Robert D.   s?  Oh yes.  And did you get your Mahogany Row?  I had a very fancy office here in Tulsa, and yes.  Now did you ever get to meet   was it Mr. Firestone?  I did.  What was your impression of him when you met him?  Oh he was   he would walk around the plants and he would go to the  cafeteria for lunch and things like that. He had a huge estate in Akron.  Robert D., the son of John W., well he became president of Firestone  years later. Of course, Firestone is run by the boards and I think it   s  owned by a Japanese company now.  I understand that you were   you had an influential role in the American  Red Cross in Oklahoma.  Well, I raised the money for the new building out by the airport.  Here in Tulsa?  Yes. They worked on me for three years and I turned them down, and  the third year, in a weak moment, I agreed to walk through the building  on Harvard which was around Thirty-fifth Street. I walked through it  12  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Jeanne  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  and when it was over I said,    If this was a MAPCO facility, I   d have it  torn down.    (Laughter) Well, I laid down the terms under which I would  agree to raise the dough, and I insisted that I could decide the location,  the cost, the design, everything connected with the building. I was able  to put a committee together that we set out to raise the  6.5 million. That  was in the late    70s. We started out talking to various foundations with  the real money, and when we had raised about  3.5 million we had a  dinner, a black tie dinner in Tulsa. We announced that we   d raised this   3.5 million and that we expected to go on and raise the rest of the  money, and build a new building.  We   re very proud of that building. They elected me chairman for a  couple of years and then they elected me chairman emeritus, which I am  to this day. We have an outstanding building that   s one of the best Red  Cross Headquarters buildings in the country, without question.  You did a good job.  All it takes is money.  Not always. You   ve got to have a little bit of willpower. You   ve had a lot  of successes, were there any ventures that you didn   t succeed at?  I can   t think of any at the moment.  Good question. (Laughs) You can   t think of one. That   s wonderful.  Now relative to today, did you ever think you   d make it to 100 years of  age?  Well, I sort of had the objective. And as I got closer, it became more  apparent that I was going to make it.  What do you contribute your longevity too? What   s your secret?  I   ve said,    Two martinis every night before dinner,    (laughter) in sort of  a joking way, but     Are those dirty martinis?  No. When I was forty or forty-five I   d think nothing of two or three  double martinis before dinner, but I don   t do that anymore.  Jeanne and I have been married six years now, and we first met each  other in 1957. We   ve both been married before, and it was    07 that we  were together for a Sunday night dinner party in November    07. In  13  Jeanne  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  October of    07 I had purchased this apartment because I had been in bed  with a terrible cold, and my doctor said,    Bob, I think it   s time for you to  go to Montereau.    Well, I hung up the phone, I called Montereau, and  they told me this apartment, penthouse apartment, was going to be  available. I said,    Put my name on it. I   ll send you a  50,000 deposit this  morning.     Without looking. (Laughs)  Then in November we were seated together at this dinner. It was a  Sunday night. Monday morning I called Jeanne to have dinner with me  Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday because I was driving to my winter  home in California Thursday. She turned me down. (Laughter) I began  to pester her on the telephone nightly. December 4th, a Friday, Williams  sent a jet to pick me up because I was testifying in a very important legal  case where I was the only living witness who knew all the characters.  Well, I flew back and I had dinner dates four nights in a row with  Jeanne. Then I told Williams if they didn   t mind flying me back two or  three days later I   d stay a little longer. The ice storm came and her house  was cold, her daughter   s house was cold, my house was nice and warm  and I kidnapped her. (Laughter) We had lots of time to talk and I tried to  convince Jeanne, the ice storm was going on, why didn   t she fly to  California with me where it was nice and warm and she finally did. And  we stayed until after New Year   s because we both had friends out there.  When we returned, we had dinner with her daughter and son-in-law.  After the grandkids had disappeared, I told them we   d had loads of time  to talk and we had decided to get married. Well, we were married in  March, and I hadn   t seen the apartment yet. (Laughter) I was paying for  it, but we finally decided we better take a look. Then, at our relative  ages, possibly we should move in and we began to upgrade it with her  decorator. Finally moved in in August    08, and we sold her house, and  we gave my house to Trinity Episcopal Church for the home of the  rector and his wife. We did a major job overhauling the place, and I  think we   ve been very happy here.  It   s home now.  Yes.  Speaking of church, how important has religion or church been in your  life?  Well, I   ve been a vestryman in the Episcopal church in the East. When I  came to Tulsa, I was on a committee at Saint Johns as a result of the  rector in the East writing to the rector here. I think church is relatively  14  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  important.  Did you ever get invited to the White House?  Oh yes, several times. Yes, I have a picture in my office of Ford and I  shaking hands with a martini in the other hand. (Laughter) I was at the  White House a number of times with the Reagans. You know, Nancy  redid the White House. It was in terrible shape. Some of the rooms had  drapes that were raggedy, paint peeling. A lot was done and contributors  were invited to a White House dinner where we were taken to the top  floor in the elevator when we arrived, and then walked down at our  leisure. I was never invited by Lyndon to the White House, and  obviously not Truman. My one episode with the Trumans was the Sam  Rayburn funeral and going aboard to have a bourbon with the Trumans.  Well when you traveled, did you do it mostly by train?  When I was on the railroad, I traveled in my private car which had a  sitting room, dining room, galley, three bedrooms.  When did you give that up?  I gave that up when I resigned as chairman.  And when was that?  That was in    65.  So you did that a while ago. Okay.  I want to know today, at a hundred, what   s a typical day like for you?  What time do you get up? What sort of things do you do during the day  and what   s a typical day like?  Well, it   s not a stressful day. I have an office on the forty-fifth floor of  the Williams building. I   m a lifetime consultant of the Williams  companies. I typically drill for oil or gas, sometimes more active than  others. At the moment it   s sort of quiet because the area we   ve been  developing in Kansas is pretty well developed now, and we   re looking  for new worlds to conquer.  So you still go to work during the week?  Oh yes.  How many hours would you say you work during the week?  15  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Jeanne  Finchum  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Oh two or three days, maybe four, and taxes require a lot of attention.  You still do some of the financial work and accounting work?  Oh not exactly. I prepare my taxes and I have an assistant that does a lot  of work for me. She   s a very capable gal.  Still very impressive.  How do you spend your time when you   re here? Do you do much  reading or watch television or what?  I watch TV some and do quite a bit of reading, financial magazines more  than anything.  Staying up with the stock market?  Well, I worry about stocks. I have quite a few.  And you were telling us earlier that you still drive.  Oh yes. Some people are surprised at that. Jeanne thinks I am one of the  best drivers she   s ever known.  He is.  Good.  And today when you look on your life, do you have a philosophy or  motto that you live by?  No.  You have anything on your bucket list, something that still want to do  that you haven   t done yet?  Well, there are a couple of places that I would love to go. One is the Taj  Mahal and the other is the Great Wall in China. Jeanne   s been to both of  them. She   s been around the world a couple of times. I have too much of  a problem with travel today, so the Taj Mahal is impossible and the  Great Wall in China. I just have too many problems staying in hotels and  so forth.  One thing we forgot to ask was did you ever have any children?  16  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Bishop  Finchum  Bishop  Finchum  Thomas  Jeanne  Bishop  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Oh yes.  What was it like to balance work life with family life? You seemed pretty  busy.  Well, I   m sure my daughter, if asked, would tell you that there were  times that I was too busy with business. I had a son who died of prostate  cancer about ten years ago. My daughter is married. Her husband is a  manufacturer of LEDs  Light-Emitting Diodes . He does all of his  manufacturing in China now. I   m very proud of him. When they were  married, I summoned him, the day before the wedding, to my office.  Summoned?  Handed him a prenuptial agreement and I said,    Sign it.    Well, my  daughter was already worth two or three million and he wasn   t worth  anything. He today is worth millions and I   m very proud of him.  Do you have grandchildren and great-grandchildren?  Oh, grandchildren. I have a grandson and a granddaughter. The grandson  is married to a lovely gal and they have two daughters. One, two, and the  other about two months.  Wow.  Hands are full.  Yes.  His daughter is also beautiful. Beautiful, intelligent, sweet, nice, you   d  love her.  Now, my question is, when history is written, what do you want it to say  about you?  I don   t know.  Is there anything that you want to be remembered for doing or how do  you want your legacy to be?  Well actually, I don   t know. A man is presently composing my obituary  so that when that day comes it will be what I want said. (Laughs) My  assistant has been after me to get that job done. John Williams, who died  about a year ago, had the same fellow write his obituary and I guess  these   Well, she   s been pestering me to get it done and I guess she   s  17  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Jeanne  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  right. Jeanne and I have recently purchased two cemetery lots. We have  had designed the stones and so forth. Age alone, because I   m fourteen  years older, would indicate that I will go first, before Jeanne, but you  never know. We had the stonework designed and so forth so that it   s  what we want and not what any relatives try to dictate. My sister, who   s  twelve years younger, is delighted that we   re doing this, and I guess it   s  a smart thing to do.  Well, you can call the shots.  Yes.  Something you   ve done a lot through your life sounds like.  Well, I guess I ought to send you an article from the Tulsa World on my  100th birthday.  We can probably get it online.  Oh, you can?  Yes. What did you do for your 100th?  Jeanne had a dinner party for over 100 guests     I don   t cook.  The mayor was there and said some nice things and he read a letter  signed by Barack and Michelle Obama. I told the dinner gathering that I  appreciated everything that they   d done at the dinner, except the letter  from the White House which got a big laugh. (Laughs)  Well, did you ever meet Henry Bellmon? If you   re Republican you  probably did.  Oh I knew Henry very, very, well. Of course I know Jim Inhofe  extremely well.  You wouldn   t have had your vodka martinis at his governor   s mansion.  No, he wouldn   t.  He was a teetotaler. So do you miss train travel?  Do I?  18  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Bishop  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Bishop  Thomas  Miss train travel?  No. I flew so much in a private airplane, and train travel was always  interesting, particularly with a private car. Although I think the engineer  seemed to delight in shaking up the last car in the train if he could.  (Laughs)  Well quite a difference from New York City to Tulsa. Did you miss much  from the big city?  No, not really. I belonged, for years, to three clubs in New York and I  spent a lot of time in New York. I was probably there at least once or  twice a month for a long time.  I   ll have to get my dates right, during the Depression you were in  college, or you had just graduate from college.  I graduated from college in 1936.  Do you have any memories of the Depression then? Did it impact  anything you were doing?  Not really, because I never lacked a job when I wanted one. My father  was never out of work.  The other question I have is in your lifetime, what   s been the greatest  change you   ve witnessed or you   ve lived through?  Well, I   ve seen a lot of change. I can remember when we first had a  radio in my home. Of course, I think my first flight in an airplane was in  1938 or 1939. That was a DC-3. Then I   ve had several trips back and  forth from Europe in the superfast airplane.  The Concorde?  Yes. I know one trip we took off from Paris about ten thirty or so in the  morning and landed in New York. I transferred to our jet and   actually I  don   t recall the exact time, but it was something like five or six minutes  from Paris to Tulsa. (Laughter)  With all the time changes.  If you could give one piece of advice to a person that wanted to live to  100, what would it be?

I don   t know why, but I do.  Your persistence paid off. That may be part of your secret, huh?  Yes, I   m the happiest I   ve ever been.  He said he had good taste. (Laughs)  Well, is there anything else you want to add before we close out?  I don   t think so.  Well, it   s been quite a pleasure. Thank you very much.  It   s been nice to visit with you.  -------  -------
