 Finchum  Rummel  Today is August 14, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in  Enid, Oklahoma, to speak with Albert, or Al, Rummel and this is part of  our Oklahoma 100 Year of Life Project, so thank you for letting us come  today.  I   m glad you came.  Let   s begin with having you tell us when and where you were born.  I was born October 1, 1913, in Stromsburg, Nebraska. That   s a little  town west of Lincoln, west of Lincoln just a little ways. That   s about it,  isn   t it?  What did your parents do for a living?  Oh, my father, after he graduated from high school, wanted to be a  doctor, so he took two years in a medical school. I don   t know whether it  was in Omaha or Lincoln, one of the two. In his second year the  professor told him he was too young to be a doctor. He was too young  looking. He said he would not be able to get a clientele, so my dad gave  up being a doctor and took up barbering instead. He was a barber for  forty-five years or more, a little more than that. Fifty years, I guess.  My mother was   they were married very young. Her name was  Florence Christine Hillberg Rummel. She was married on May 25, 1910,  at a very early age. I don   t know. She was either sixteen or seventeen. I  don   t know which. They right away started a family and had four or five  boys. They had four boys that lived, one that did not, and so that was my  family. I was number three.  5  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Number three, okay, and what was your father   s name?  My father   s name was Oliver Frank Rummel     Okay.     and he was a barber. I told you that. That caused him to move from  one town to the next to find one where he could make a good living. The  first one that he lived at was Ord, Nebraska. That was a little town of  about five hundred. That was not big enough. The next one, they moved  back to Stromsburg, and he worked there for about five years or more.  That   s where I was born. By the way, my mother was born there, too, in  that town, but earlier, of course. Let   s see. My two older brothers have  all, of course, have all since passed away, and my youngest brother, too.  Their families are still active, and they live in all over the United States,  some in Dallas, some in Los Angeles, and some in Colorado, and  everywhere. We   re really spread out.  Where did you go to elementary school?  At five different towns, I went to elementary school. At the beginning, I  went to first grade in Grand Island, Nebraska. Second grade I took in  Stromsburg, Nebraska. The third grade was Big Springs, Nebraska, and I  took third and fourth grade there together. Then, I moved back to  Stromsburg for the fifth grade and O   Neill, Nebraska, for the sixth grade  where I took the seventh and eighth grade together and graduated in  1930. I was number two in the class of forty. (Laughter)  You were a good student, then   I had nothing else to do. (Laughter) I didn   t go out for sports or  anything.  The thing that squelched my athletic desires was that as a  sixth grade student, as I said, I was rather small and not very heavy. The  class was made up of nine girls and eleven boys, so the teacher made up  four basketball teams. Guess who was selected to play on the girls     team, me. That did it for me as far as an athlete was concerned.  I just  studied because I was too little and too young and too small. I was  considered an infant, really, because I was so small and looked so small.  My facial features were baby-like, so I never could get anybody  interested in adultery. (Laughter) No, I mean as an adult I couldn   t  hardly get   but, yeah, that was really good. Then after   is this what you  want to hear?  Sure, yes, you   re doing great.  Then after I graduated from high school   my two older brothers and me  6  Finchum  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  all graduated in 1930, one class, in the same class. I caught up with  them. (Laughs) After I graduated, I worked for a photo studio doing  photography. That is developing and printing photographs and stuff and  mailing them back to the customers. I did that for about a year, not more  than a year because I was drafted by a grocer, a grocery man. He said he  wanted me to come to work for him. Like a dutiful person, I went to  work for him in the grocery store where I worked for ten years, ten  years.  Wow.  Ten years. During that time, the supervisors of the chain store decided  that I ought to be given a store of my own, so they opened a store in  Iowa. It was Spirit Lake, Spirit Lake, Iowa, and I went to work there.  That was a fiasco. It really was because they had a big celebration, you  know, opening a grocery store. I think that there was a lot of pilfering  going on during that time. The next time they took an inventory, it  showed up very short of merchandise, so they decided that they better  have a different manager. I said that we didn   t do any pilfering on it. It  had to be shoplifters because they had a big crowd. You couldn   t take  care of all of them and check them out. They moved me to another store  as assistant manager, and that   s when Uncle Sam got their hooks into  me. I was drafted into the service in 1941 before the war.  I was just curious. You worked during the Great Depression?  Yes, the Depression was 1929, and I worked all through 1930 in this  grocery store, clear up to 1939 and    40. Then   41 was when the Army  got me. That was on the fifth of August, 1941. War wasn   t declared until  December, so I was in for four full months before the war started. That  was   do you want to hear about that?  I sure do   I got on the train in Spirit Lake, and they took me to Des Moines, Iowa,  to Fort Des Moines. We arrived there about midnight, but then they took  us off the train, me and four other guys, and tried to start processing us  right then. We hadn   t even been to sleep. Hadn   t been to sleep. At two o     clock in the morning, they gave us an IQ test. I was one of the hundreds  that were there. I was one of five that tested real high, so they gathered  me and these other four guys and sent us to Fort Monmouth, New  Jersey, to the Signal Corps.  At that time, the Air Corps was associated with the Signal Corps. It was  not separated yet, and so that   s where I stayed then, with the Signal  Corps for the next five years. They moved me from one station to  7  Finchum  Rummel  another across the United States, from New Jersey to Missouri, to  Sacramento, then Fort Stockton, California. Then from there they booted  me over to New Guinea, and we went to New Guinea, the same guys.  They followed me all the way through there.  During that time, I was singled out and given promotion after promotion  just because there was so few soldiers in the Army at that time. They  were accumulating them, so they had to have noncommissioned officers.  I was made a corporal about the first four months. In about a year or two  later, I was made a sergeant. The next day after sergeancy, I was made a  staff sergeant. That   s where I stayed until the first sergeant left to go to  OCS  Officer Candidate School , and I became the first sergeant. That  was about the last two years in the Army.  Like I said, they booted us over to New Guinea in Port Moresby, and  Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, and in Manila. We stayed there for, oh, a  long, long time. It was after all the fighting was done. There was still  debris, Japanese airplanes and things, on the runway. We did a lot of  cleanup work. (Laughter) We did a lot of cleanup work because there  was no need of communications. Our telephones, telegraphs, and radios  were existing, but they didn   t need them because it was all over.  Then after spending a lot of time in Manila, we got a call to get ready for  occupation of Japan. They were going to invade Japan. That   s when they  decided that the atomic bomb would prevent that. That would take care  of the hostility there and would save the lives of the soldiers that were  coming over there. We got over to Japan right during the surrender. We  stayed out in the Tokyo Bay while they were doing all these maneuvers  and signing all the declarations and everything. After they got that all  figured out and straightened out and no more war, they put us off in  Yokohama, and we moved into kind of a barn-like affair. What do you  call it?  All I can think of is Quonset hut or barracks or     No, more like a big barn is what it was like. They had all these soldiers  in there. That was a real mess. Then, they started singling those people  out, sending them to different places in Japan to kind of let them know  that we were there and prevent any uprisings and stuff like that. Me,  with all my men   at that time they had about 300 men assigned to me as  my company, and they moved us downtown in Tokyo, right across from  the palace in a seven-story building. That was my building. We moved  in there and occupied it. General MacArthur was two buildings down  from us.  The next building to us was the Second Cavalry, and they were assigned  8  Finchum  as MPs  Military Police  for the whole area to watch over everybody and  take charge of whatever needed to be taken charge of. They moved us  into this seven-story building and kept assigning more and more men. I  think by the time I left, there was 700 men there in that building that  were assigned to that building. In the meantime, we were expected and  dutifully promoted to assigning a small group of men to General  MacArthur   s headquarters every morning for cleanup work and work  around the kitchen and whatever needed to be done. We were really a  service company at that time.  One night, after everything was all quieted down and all the assignments  were read, I decided as long as I   m downtown   some of our stuff, our  items, our equipment was still in a bay area but still in Tokyo. I decided  that I wanted to see downtown a little better. I took a two-and-a-half-ton  truck from the motor pool that I thought was empty, and I drove it across  these rickety old bridges and got downtown. I parked it down there.  Later I found out what was in that truck. It was cement. (Laughter)  There must have been four tons of cement in that truck.  In the meantime, while I was wandering around downtown looking at  things and looking at the palace, (and it was not dark yet) a man come  up the street alone. I turned to him and said,    Hi.    He says,    Hi.    I says,     You don   t talk English, do you?    He says,    Yes.    He was a banker, and  he had just left the bank. He says,    I went to Columbia University in  New York. I know English.    We sat on the curb and talked until two o     clock in the morning. That   s when I decided that I better get my truck  back. (Laughs) We said goodbye, and he said,    I   ll come and see you  tomorrow.    I told him where my office was, and he showed up the next  morning. He was going to be my interpreter from then on.  He got me into all kinds of items. Like, he got me a dinner date with a  doctor there in Tokyo. We sat cross-legged, of course. Only men were  served. The women, they were the servers. I enjoyed talking to the  doctor through the interpreter. We bantered back and forth and talked  about a lot of things. The next one was a performer in a stage play. He  was the leading performer. He clobbered onto us, me and my friend. We  palled around together. He invited us to his house. It was nearby, so we  went there for a meal one evening. That was very strange. They served  cherry blossom tea, and the only item I remember eating was French-fried  sweet potatoes. That was the meal. I don   t know what else. I didn   t  recognize the other items. (Laughter) Then another person that I  interviewed with and talked with was a man that I understood him to say  he was a prince. I didn   t know that the dignitaries had princes in there,  but they could have, couldn   t they?  I don   t have any idea.  9  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  I had no idea, but I thought he was a prince. He took us in. We sat on the  floor, of course. No furniture. They don   t have furniture. We sat there  and talked through the interpreter, and it was real good, real fine. I got to  feeling like I was an ambassador rather than a first sergeant in the Army.  Do you ever remember the interpreter   s name?  No, no, I don   t know his name. I don   t think he ever told me. I really  don   t.  But he was Japanese?  He was Japanese. He was a banker, and he worked in the bank. There  wasn   t much going on as far as banking was concerned, so he had a lot  of free time.  Did you ever feel like you were in harm   s way?  No. I did in New Guinea but not in     Not in Japan?     not in Tokyo, never, never. One of my soirees where I was walking  the streets looking at things, just a block off of where I was stationed,  where my building was, just a block off of that the town was flat. I mean  there was no buildings out there at all. I think they call that the Ginza  Strip. It was unharmed, but everything on the other side of it was gone,  either burned or bombed, one of the two. I don   t know which. It was  really torn up.  One store that I had visited on this Ginza part, it was still in operation  and still had people in there running the business. What they had was  cloisonn   vases of all sizes and shapes, and beautiful things. I couldn   t  pass that up, so I bought one. It was a vase about yeigh big around, (I got  it in there on television) about yeigh big around and about this tall. It   s  just beautiful, all cloisonn  . I couldn   t confiscate it, so I bought it.  (Laughter) I think I paid a hundred dollars for it. After I did that, my  soldier friends, they were on the lookout. They picked up two more  cloisonn   vases. There   s one of them right there.  That   s pretty.  There   s another one on the other side. I was so taken with those. They  were so beautiful. I couldn   t pass them up, so I got both of those, too.  10  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  And you got them back without breaking or     I got them back without breaking. I boxed them up and mailed them  back to my folks in California. That vase in there is damaged now. I had  it sitting on the fireplace...  The mantle or hearth.     hearth, and a visitor knocked it over, and hit it on one side. The stuff  just crackled and popped off on that side, and on the opposite side it  crackled, too. I don   t know how it did that, but, anyway, it was quite a  blow. I wasn   t going to throw it away because it   s still my vase, and I  am very proud of it. I still like it. It   s beautiful. That is about the time I  started losing my mind of all the things I had to do and the pressure that  I was under. My captain wasn   t much help. He didn   t do me any good.  I finally got my points, you know, the point system. I finally got it up to  seventy, and that   s when I could be discharged. One day I just told  everybody goodbye, and I hopped on a truck. He took me up to what  they called the Japanese West Point  Camp Drake , was where the  discharges were going to be made, or where they were going to ship  them off to California. I was really fit to be tied, and I couldn   t wait to  get home. It was rough. I just didn   t care anymore about that. I was  disgusted with them. I was very unhappy at that time, very unhappy, and  like I said, I took the next year off from everything. I didn   t do anything.  I just stayed with my folks, had my meals there, and I slept there. I did  whatever I wanted to do. I didn   t do anything. They didn   t ask me to do  anything. I got my mentality back like it should be, but it was a rough go  for that year.  During the time I was in El Monte  California , (that   s where my folks  lived) he was a barber there, and he settled down real good, making lots  of money there. There was a big company, a big town that had lots of  people that needed haircuts. I lived with them, and there was a big two-story  house being torn down, down the street from them. They were  going to put in a drugstore there. I heard that they were going to put in a  drugstore. I told my folks, I says,    I   ll just stay here, and when they open  that drugstore I   ll go to work for them,    and I did. It was about a year  later, and I went to work for the drugstore. I only worked there for about  six months or more, about eight months. I kind of turned into assistant  manager there. They had me assigned to the liquor department,  (laughter) liquor all over the place. That was not good, either. I didn   t  like that.  Anyway, I worked for them for a while. One day a man came up to my  counter, and he looked me in the eye, and he says,    How would you like  11  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  to go to work for me?    I says,    Why, sure. What do you do?    (Laughter)  He says,    I work for Rexall Drug Company in the world headquarters.    I  says,    Why, sure. You give me about a week, and you can pick me up.     He lived just beyond where I did, and he could pick me up to go into  town every morning. He did that for a long, long time. I worked for  Rexall for five years. That turned out to be a disappointment because I  was out of town so much, and my wife, with two little kids, she got kind  of sick of it. She says,    I don   t like being alone.    I   d be gone a week at a  time and sometimes two weeks at a time. She says,    Let   s move back to  Oklahoma.    I says,    Well, it makes me no never mind. I can work  anywhere.    So I said,    Okay.     I don   t have a picture of him there, when Jon was three months old.  June, July, August, yeah, it was in August. He was three months old, and  Kathleen, my daughter, was one year and three months old. We loaded  up. We sold our furniture and packed up our dishes and everything we  wanted. We moved to Oklahoma to her folks    place. They lived at that  time in El Reno. They hadn   t moved from Fairview to El Reno. We  stayed there for about, maybe, two weeks. I told Mr. Nicholson, I said     that was my father-in-law. I told him that I wanted to go to work. He  said,    Well, I know a drugstore in Enid where I think you could go to  work. I know the people that run it.    He went up and talked to them.  They said,    Sure, bring him up.    They brought me up there, and I went  to work for Sanford-Stunkel. I found out later that it used to be Sanford-  Stunkel-Frazier, and Frazier was my mother-in-law   s sister. They lived  in Enid. Everybody moved to Enid, and that   s where we raised the kids.  Well, let   s back up, then. How did you meet your wife?  Oh, that   s another story. I met her while I was working at this drugstore  in El Monte  California . A friend of mine asked me if I wanted to go on  a blind date. He said he and his girlfriend was going to go. I said,    Why  sure, we can do that. I can do that.    I went to this blind date, met  Maureen, and right away she thought I was it. I really couldn   t do  anything about it except to go ahead and fall in love with her. (Laughter)  Everything seemed to be working out just fine, and we got married in  Pasadena about a year later, or two years later, in 1948.  Well, what was she doing in California?  She had been a schoolteacher here in Enid and various towns around  Enid, and she got tired of that. She knew a friend had gone to California,  so she contacted her. She says,    You go ahead and come on out.    She  says,    I got a professor that has got a lease already signed for you. All  you have to do is come on out. You   ve got the job.    She went to work,  then, for the California Teachers Association. She worked in, let   s see,  12  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  one, two, three, three different schools in California. After we were  married, that   s where we lived, within walking distance of one of them  in Compton, California. That   s where we were living up until the time  we wanted to move. We moved then to El Reno and eventually in Enid.  That would have been in the    50s?  Been here ever since, yeah.  Okay.  That was fifty-some years ago. That has been real good to us, really  good to us even though teachers    salaries were almost nonexistent at that  time, you know. It was hard to get along on my salary and hers. It was  still not enough to raise two kids.  Well, some places wouldn   t let school teachers be married. Did she have  that problem?  At the time she started teaching, that was one of the rules. She had to  remain single, and she had to go to church every Sunday in that town  where she was. She was really hogtied, and I think that   s what got her to  want to move to a different place, so that   s what she did.  Well, when she got married did she tell them, or did she keep it secret  for a while?  Oh, that was much later, after that had expired. That type of rule had  expired, and they didn   t object to being married then. We got married,  lived in Compton until we went to Enid through El Reno. I often  wondered if she wanted to move back to Fairview where she was born.  She says,    No way     She says she didn   t want anything to do with  Fairview again. (Laughter) She had some bad experiences there. That   s  why.  How did you get things back? Pack up the car and come, or did you  come by train or what?  Oh, we came by car. I drove through, from Compton to El Reno, without  lodging, without a motel. I never stopped. I drove thirty hours straight  through.  That   s a little too much.  It was too much, but I could do it because we didn   t have enough money  to stop at any motel or anything.  13  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Did you ever pull over to rest?  No, we   d pull over and let my wife drive awhile. (Laughter)  Okay, that helps. (Laughter)  That did help, but I didn   t do much sleeping then, either. (Laughter) We  just kept driving. That   s all I did and stopped to eat, of course. One  night, it was time to feed the kids, and we was on the road in a country  little town. We wanted the bottles warmed up. We had the bottles  already prepared and took them into this restaurant, and I handed them  to this guy that was running the place. I says,    Would you warm these  up for me?    He says,    Sure.    He took them and poured the stuff in a  skillet     Oh my gosh.     and then poured it back into the bottle.  He must have not had kids.  The kids loved it. They couldn   t get enough of it. It was the best bottle  they ever had. (Laughter) It was an old iron skillet. They have grease  already in them, and it was in the milk. They just loved that bottle. Later  we found out a way of warming them just by running hot water on them.  Besides that, you really don   t need to warm a bottle for a kid. It gets  warm on the way down, anyway. That was the funniest thing I ever saw.  They really did like it.  If that year, your last year, in the Army hadn   t been so rough, would you  have made it a career?  No, absolutely no. My dad asked me after a while, (I had been living in  El Monte) he asked me,    Would you consider going back into the  Army? You could make a career of it, and it would be pretty good pay.     I says,    Absolutely not. I never want to see them again.    I never did. I  just gave up right then, anything to do with the Army.  Once you got to New Guinea and that sequence started, did you get to  come back home any?  No. No, I didn   t see United States until after Tokyo.  Okay.  14  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  It was just     And New Guinea was rough?  A year and some-months was what I was over there, almost two years,     44 and    45 to    46. Time was at a standstill for me. All those years and  days and months, they just all blended into nothing. I have a hard time  separating them to saying that I was here on a certain date and there on a  certain date. I can   t do it. I just don   t know it.  One island I left out was after New Guinea was a little island of Biak.  You can   t even find it on the map. It was a coral island, coral, just flat  coral, nothing else. We were there for six months, and I got tired of that.  I wrote a memo to the headquarters to find out why we weren   t being  assigned to something. Right away they come back with a note, and they  sent us by air to the Leyte Gulf. The fighting had just quit there. I tell  you, that was something. Then from then on, it was just after the  fighting   I was there long enough to be entitled to a ribbon, you know,  Pacific area. I got five medals, five medals.  Oh, and one other thing, the reason why we didn   t like Fairview. My  wife had, about 1943, became engaged to a soldier, and they had a big  to-do about the engagement party. She had a cedar chest and had it all  filled up with stuff, but the soldier didn   t ever come back. They lost her.  She had a nervous breakdown because of that. She told me about the  breakdown, and I says,    Well, you got over it haven   t you?    She says,     Yes, I think so.    We just dismissed it from then on, but she would  never let me hang my discharge papers. I got them framed, and I hang  them now, but she would never let me hang that in the house. She says,     You can hang it out in the garage if you want to.    The medals, I had  them framed. She says,    You can hang those out in the garage, too.    She  would never let me talk about the war. I could never discuss it with my  kids at all. She never would stand for it. She just didn   t want to hear  about it.  When you were in Japan   you talked about MacArthur. Did you ever  meet him personally?  I didn   t ever meet him personally, no. I only saw him one time when he  was getting out of his limousine and walking up the steps into this  building next to the bank. It was called (I don   t know what the words  mean) Dai-Ichi, Dai-Ichi  Seimei  Building. I think it was a government  building of some sort, and I tell you that was   .  I tell you one other thing that I was really shocked at was when we was  in Tokyo, we got paid in American money. They were on the yen  15  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  system, and we had all kinds of trouble. One day we got a memo from  MacArthur   s headquarters that we were to turn in all American money  and get yen for it. I was already sending most of mine home anyway to a  bank. I didn   t have much to exchange, but I says,    I   m not going to turn  it all in.    I kept one five-dollar bill, and I   ve still got it. My grandson   s  got it right now. I think I   m the only one that saved one of those pieces  of money. It   s going to be an item one of these days     A collector   s item?     a very choice item. I keep telling Mark about that. I says,    Don   t ever  try to spend that. You save that. It   s going to be worth something one of  these days.    He   s still got it. That   s about the time I became a coin  collector. I got a box about that long, about this wide, about that high,  and it   s full of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters, no half-dollars, and  silver dollars, and this paper dollar. It   s got that five-dollar bill in it that I  am not going to turn in. (Laughs)  Well, you mentioned that New Guinea was   you felt like you might be in  danger in New Guinea?  Yes, we used to go trapping in the woods. The natives were still in little  bunches, little huts, and things like that. I know one day we were  walking down a single path, and, I don   t know, for some reason or other,  it might   ve been something that I smelled or something that smelled like  a Japanese, but the back of my hair stood on end. I thought,    He can   t  fire a shot or he   d get killed himself,    so I didn   t fire a shot. I didn   t  have one to fire, anyway. We went ahead and walked on and did our  business with the natives, and we came back that same way. That was  the only time that I ever felt threatened. It was really something. It was  really something. I was really afraid because I didn   t have any  ammunition, and I hoped he didn   t either if it was a Japanese, but he  could   ve been hiding in those bushes. He might   ve been living with the  natives, too. As far as I know, he   s still there. (Laughter)  Well, when you came back to the States, was there some kind of welcome  home, or did you just kind of slowly go to     Just kind of floated in. (Laughs) The only time that I mentioned it was  when I was going downtown from the seaport. I just casually says to this  girl that I was sitting next to, I says,    I just got back from Tokyo.    She  says,    Oh.    (Laughs) That was it. That was my welcome. (Laughter)  There was a band on the little ship that ushered the big ship into the port.  There was a band on that, that played music. That   s the only thing. As  far as individual greetings, there was no such thing, no such thing.  16  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Well, did your parents know you were coming?  No. I called them from San Francisco and told them. I says,    I don   t  know when I   ll get down there, but I   ll let you know.    I tried every  known means of transportation that I could think of. Couldn   t get on an  airplane, couldn   t get on a bus, couldn   t get on a train. The only thing  open was a ship in the harbor that was going to go to Los Angeles. I  says,    Okay, that   s me.    I got on this ship, and we went down overnight  to Los Angeles. They let me off at Fort MacArthur, and that   s where I  got my true discharge. That   s where I called my folks to come down to  the Los Angeles depot. I took a bus from Fort MacArthur up to Los  Angeles depot, and that   s where they picked me up.  Happy to see you, I   m sure.  Oh, I should say so. They weren   t as happy as I was. (Laughter) I was  really jumping. My father and my mother were there, lined up, and my  oldest brother. His wife was out in the car. She was taking care of a four-month-  old Dickey, Richard Rummel. He was only four months old, and  she was out in the car with Dickey. The rest of them, we all, then, took  off and got in the car and went up to El Monte. Those were the days.  Everything seemed to be going my way then, from then on, because I  was always babied anyway, as one of the youngest children. I just fell  right into it.  That one year, though, that you just took off, you felt like you needed to  just decompress?  I did need to get my mentality back in order because I was ready for a  padded cell.  And you had to do that on your own? The VA didn   t help?  Yeah, I did. They didn   t have such a thing as psychiatry.  Yeah, true.  I did a pretty good job on my own.  It was smart that you realized you needed it and took it.  Oh, I sure did. I only did what I wanted to do, and that was very little. I  did drive the car at night when I was   I got my days turned around. I   d  sleep all day and eat in the daytime, and then I   d prowl all night long  (Laughs) in bars and, well, everywhere, just out looking for friends to  make friends with.  17  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  And then one day you woke up and realized,    It   s time to move on   ?  I did finally. Well, it gradually worked on me that way. I finally decided  that I should get married and do what I was supposed to do.  And you got married in forty-     Eight.  Forty-eight, so you would   ve been twenty-six? Thirty-six.  What?  Thirty-six. If you were born in   no. You were born in    13     Yeah.     so thirty-five.  Thirty-five.  You   re like me. I have to write it down.  Can   t count backwards.  Anyway, I was in my late thirties. A lot of this stuff that I   ve been telling  you, my son and his son, his oldest son, got me cornered one day and  had me go through all my Army experiences with them, but they didn   t  record it. They didn   t write it down or anything. They just   verbally is  all. That   s the first time that I had ever got the chance to tell them  anything about my Army career or my early marriage or anything like  that. Let   s see. I lost a branch there.  During telling that story about my Army career, I happened to mention  to Chris, (that   s the grandson) I says,    You won   t believe this, but all  through the Army I carried a weapon, but I never was issued a bullet.     (Laughter) I says,    I never was issued one. I don   t know what would   ve  happened if I   d had a shell in my rifle.    He says,    Oh, I   m going to call  you Barney.    I says,    You mean Barney Oldfield?    He says,    No,  Barney Fife.    (Laughter) He says,    Barney never got a bullet, either.     (Laughter)  He did not.  The reason I thought he said Barney Oldfield was because I had just  18  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  come from Tulsa and got a speeding ticket for doing ninety miles an  hour on the speedway. (Laughter) That   s what I thought he was referring  to. He said,    No, Barney Fife.    (Laughs)  Ninety miles an hour  Mmm-hmm.  Golly, (Laughs) I had a lot of fun telling him all of these features and  things.  Well, do you want to tell a couple more since we are recording it, since  they didn   t?  Uh   yes  While I was in New Guinea, I happened to mention to the  commander, I says,    Being this close to the ocean you   d think that we   d  have more fun on the beach and places, but I can   t swim. I don   t know  how.    He says,    Okay, well, I   ll teach you how to swim.    I says,    You  won   t let me go? You won   t let go of me?    He said,    I am not going to  even touch you.    I says,    Well, we   ll give it a try.    We went down to the  beach and went out into the ocean. I could still have my feet on the sand  for part of the time. We got out into the ocean, and he says,    Okay, leave  your eyes open, take a deep breath, and submerge.    I says,    You mean  go under the water?    (Laughter) That   s kind of new to me. He says,     Yeah, go ahead. Just duck down under the water and look around.     I says,    Okay,    so I did. I come back up, and I says,    How was that?    He  says,    That was fine. Now, take your arms and do a paddle of some kind  and get your feet off the sand.    I says,    Like this?    and I did that. He  says,    Yeah, that   s right.    He says,    Go ahead and dog paddle,    and I  did. He says,    Now, while you   re doing that, get your face under water  and your head under water so you can see what you   re doing down  there.    I says,    Okay.    From then on, it was just a lot of fun. I just  learned how to swim. I never did do the Olympic-type swimming but  just dogpaddled and flapping my feet. It got me out there in the ocean,  and I had a lot of fun doing that.  One other item along with that was one night I was in my bed, and here  comes a big ol    ugly dog, a wire-haired terrier. She crawled under my  bed and laid down under there. I reached down and patted her on the  head like that, and from then on she was my friend. She was never  without me. I was never without her. When we   d go swimming, I   d just  say to her,    Shall we go swimming?    and she was gone. She was down  on the beach waiting for me. (Laughter)  Did you name her?  No, no. I know she was a Japanese dog because they had left her there.  19  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Think about bringing her back with you?  I tried to bring her to Tokyo with me when we was going to Tokyo, but  they wouldn   t let her on the plane. Later, the guy apologized to me. He  says,    I didn   t know there was a company mascot.    I says,    Yeah, but  she   ll be all right.    I know she would be because she knew the island  pretty well. That was the end of the dog story. That dog may have  scented something on me that told her I was a dog lover because when I  was four years old in Grand Island, Nebraska, we always played on the  street and on the sidewalk and everything. I was way down the street one  day, and we had this dog, this big ol    ugly wire-hair terrier. She was our  guardian, our kids    guardian. My mother hollered for me to come home,  and the dog went out and grabbed me by the hand in her mouth and led  me home. That scent of that dog might have been on my hand. Might  still be there. Ever since then, I   ve been hunting for one of those kind of  dogs, and I have not found one yet. It   s just a place in my heart for that  type of dog, big ol    ugly wire-haired terrier. (Laughter) She knew how to  take care of kids.  So at four you were, that was like     That   s when I started grade school. I started when I was four because I  was going to be five very soon and they allowed that. I remember my  dad taking me to school on a bicycle. That   s all we had. The name of the  school was Lincoln, Lincoln School. I remember that, too. He let me off,  and that   s what he did. He left me off. Left it up to me to find my way,  and I guess I did because I wound up in a schoolroom. I remember the  schoolroom, too.  Did he do that every day, take you on a bicycle?  No, no, not every day.  Just the first?  I don   t know how I got to school otherwise, but that first day he was  going to make sure I got to school. After that, I think that we walked to  school because it wasn   t very far. I think we walked to school, and my  older brothers did, too. They walked to school, so we all went to be  together. That was fortunate. All through my younger years, we never  lived more than a block away from a school, never, (it was amazing) so  we didn   t have to worry about transportation or taking the bus or  anything like that. We walked to school.  During your first and second grade, that would   ve been about the time  20  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  influenza epidemic was going...  Well, I wound up in Grand Island, having pneumonia twice. I still  finished the first grade. I had a habit of getting sick on the weekends.  (Laughs) I was usually okay to go to school after that, you know, on  Monday. (Laughter)  Did you have any uncles that were in World War I?  Yeah, had one uncle, my mother   s brother. His name was Walter  Hillberg, and he was in France and Germany. I don   t know what he did.  He never talked about it much either.  But he made it back?  Yes, he made it back. As a matter of fact, he was living with my folks in  El Monte. He had been accepted in the Veterans Hospital area. He was  supposed to stay there, but he   d get tired of that, and he   d check out and  go somewhere else. I tell you.  In the Great Depression, did that have an impact on you, because you  said you were employed, but what kind of impact did the Great  Depression have?  The only impact was that my salary was terribly low. I don   t think I  made   I know I didn   t make more than five dollars a week, or ten cents  a dollar is what it was. With that money I was able to go to dances.  Finally my brother and I went together and bought a car.  What was it?  A Plymouth. I think we paid six hundred dollars for it or something like  that. That   s what it was. We had it on monthly payments of twenty  dollars, so I   d put in ten dollars, and he   d put in ten dollars. That went  along real good. That was during the Depression, and it was terrible.  Everybody trying to get your money. Lots of people didn   t have money  for groceries. We had that grocery store stocked, and every weekend  they just probably cleaned us out. I don   t know if the manager was  furnishing groceries to someone or not, but there was a lot of poor  people and a lot of other grocery stores in town that were not making it,  and they finally closed.  You were living with your folks at the time? You were living at home?  Yes.  21  Finchum  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  So that helped.  Yeah, that helped. I didn   t pay them anything for board and room, but  later my dad says,    We   re going to have to start charging you because  you   ve been living here pretty good.    I says,    You   re right. You should  be charging me.    They said they was going to charge me a dollar a week  after that. My two older brothers and my younger brother, they were all  married by that time, and they all had good jobs with the electric  company. That was a good deal. My oldest brother, he worked in a  creamery company that bought cream and sent it to be made into butter.  As a matter of fact, he was our butter maker for a while. I tell you, those  were very rough times for everybody.  My oldest brother, then, in 1941, they finally had their oldest son, Kurt.  That was 1941. They decided that living in Enid wasn   t making much  money, so they decided they were going to move to California. They up  and went to California, and he got a job right away with Northrop Air   Corporation , Northrop Air. He worked there for all of his time that he  was in California. Alice never had to go to work, so they were paid  pretty good. My next older brother was in the electric company, and he  was moved around a lot. He moved to Minnesota and, well, mostly  Minnesota and Nebraska. He worked for them for a while. That wasn   t  paying him very much, so he took up insurance sales. He worked for the  insurance company, and he worked for them for quite a while. Then he  became an adjustor for that company, and he moved out to Scottsbluff,  Nebraska. Everybody was moving everywhere, going everywhere.  (Laughter)  I want to know how important was, or how central, I should say, was  religion and spirituality in your family, or going to church, things like  that, or for you, too?  Well, we went to church and Sunday school all those times, different  churches, of course, but never settled down as a member of that church.  My dad claimed to be an atheist, and I caught him more than once when  he was not an atheist. I never mentioned it to him at all. It was his  business, and I wasn   t going to interfere with it. He was religious, but he  didn   t ever admit it or he never went to church. The only time he went to  church was when I was a youth pastor in a Presbyterian church. That   s  the only time he ever went to church.  My mother, of course, she was with it, but she was pretty much of a  churchgoer. She did that a lot. When my wife and I got married, we went  to the Methodist church, and we were members of that here in Enid.  When they started talking about early education, that was right up her  alley. She says,    I think I   ll open a preschool.    I says,    Well, that ought  22  Bishop  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  to be all right.    But it was going to be tuition. I says,    Is that going to be  good?    She says,    Yeah, they   ll come to it.    I says,    Okay.    She got  permission from DeWitt Waller. He   s one of the principals, or  superintendent. What do you call the head man?  Superintendent probably, or principal.  Superintendent or principal.  Principal? Would he be a principal?  Of a school, but     No, this was of the whole deal.  Superintendent.  DeWitt Waller.  Superintendent.  Superintendent.  Yeah, he was the superintendent, then, wasn   t he?  Yes.  Anyway, DeWitt Waller says,    Yeah, you go ahead with that if you want  to,    and Maureen says,    Okay.    She got it all set up and put out the  notices that preschool was going to be opened and that tuition was going  to be thirty dollars for the month session which would be half-days one  day and half-days later in the week. It   d be just one day a week. It was  half-days. She set it all up, and I think she got thirty-five kids on the first  go-around. That really set it in motion. They were all tuition kids, and  they took to it. They really did enjoy going to school in the way she  presented it. It finally spread. The news of that preschool spread.  Oh, and while she was doing that, she thought about kindergarten. She  wanted to open kindergarten. DeWitt Waller says,    Okay.    They didn   t  have kindergarten in Oklahoma at that time, but he said,    Go ahead with  the kindergarten.    She did, so she was running both preschool and  kindergarten on a basis of so many days, two days a week or three days  a week. They finally opened it in all the schools, kindergarten in all the  schools. She was supervisor for all the kindergartens, but she was still  working on this preschool bit, and it was going so good.  23  Bishop  Rummel  Finally the state got a hold of it and had her and another lady that was  helping her come to the office down in Oklahoma City to talk to them  about this preschool and kindergarten. Right away they opened  kindergarten and put it in all the schools right then. They had her write  instructions, an instruction manual or something. I   ve got a copy of it. It  told how to handle the kids, what to teach them, how to teach them, and  how to keep them interested. It went over real good. It did. The  kindergarten teachers said,    I can tell which ones of these students have  been to your preschool,    because some of them were ready to read.  Some of them could read. The teachers said,    We   ll just go ahead and  teach them what they need to know, teach them reading and writing.     The kindergarten just went off like a bang, like that. All through the  school, the teachers could tell which ones had been to the preschool.  That went on for ten years. She worked for ten years on preschool, and  that was really wonderful.  When I initially met with you, you talked about (and I wonder if you  could mention this) an event that you were in, like, in a motel. You had  an experience in a motel where you spent the night, a motel fire or  carbon dioxide     Oh, oh yeah. I was telling you about my guardian angel that night.  That   s what that was. I believe that I have one and have had one all my  life because the things that should   ve wiped me out never did. My  mother said one time that I had encephalitis, and I don   t believe that at  all. I think it must   ve been something else, but whatever it was   that   s  brain fever, and that is detrimental to your intelligence. I know that   s not  true.  This other, what he   s referring to, was a friend of mine we were going to  hitchhike down to Santa Ana. Can you imagine, from Sacramento to  Santa Ana? Do you know how far that is? It   s over six hundred miles,  and hitchhiking. We started out on Friday evening, and we got way  down there. I don   t remember what the town was, but it got real dark.  You couldn   t do much hitchhiking after dark, so we stopped at a motel.  They were real pleasant and real fortuitous about soldiers, so they gave  us a motel room. We went in and crawled into bed because we   re going  to get up real early to start hitchhiking again.  It was cold, so we had this gas heater going. During the night, I woke up,  and I could hardly breathe. I looked at this heater, and it was orange, not  blue like it should be. It was orange. I had to go to the bathroom, so I  went to the bathroom, but there was another guy already in there. I just  said,    Excuse me,    (Laughs) and went ahead. During that time, I think I  got some fresh air, and when I came back out I could see this orange  flame was still going. I knew what was wrong, and my guardian angel  24  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Bishop  took me over to the door, and I opened it. I laid on the floor right there,  and I breathed that fresh air. It was the sweetest breath of air I ever had.  It was wonderful, and I just laid there until I could get up.  I began to worry about Fred, my friend, wondered how he was doing. I  woke him up. It was about time to get up, anyway. I woke him up, and  he was all right. He didn   t seem to be any worse for the wear. I guess he  had inhaled his fresh air while he was in there asleep. He was all right,  so we went to the restaurant and ordered breakfast. I thought I   d go  ahead and splurge and have some pancakes, so we both had pancakes.  They were no charge. They tried to give us some more pancakes, and I  couldn   t eat anymore. That was all I needed was what I had and coffee.  That was really a rarity, I thought, for them to do that. Maybe they  thought, or maybe they knew, that I had been close to expiring. They  might   ve known that. Maybe I still looked a little pale or something.  Anyway, we got down to Santa Ana the next day and got down there in  the evening in time for supper at my aunt   s house, my father   s sister. She  lived in Santa Ana. She had an orange grove down there. She was all  kinds of money. She was very wealthy. She was married   nothing but  bankers all through her career. (Laughter) The last banker she married  was from Hydro, Hydro, Oklahoma. He and she moved to California and  bought this orange grove. It was a Sunkist orange grove, so they didn   t  have to take care of it at all. The Sunkist people would take care of it and  harvest it when it needed be, but oranges, you know, are ripening all the  time. Every so often they had to come and pick them, and they   d grow  more. We enjoyed visiting with my aunt and uncle, and my father and  mother were there, too. They had gone down for visiting, too.  Not hitchhike, though. Your parents hadn   t hitchhiked.  They didn   t hitchhike. They had my car. (Laughs)  How did you get back?  That   s another story. That   s another story, I   ll tell you. To tell you the  honest truth, I don   t know whether I took the car. I must have. I must  have told them that I had to have the car to get back to camp. I had to be  back by Monday morning, you know. This was Sunday night, so we  took the car all night long and drove that six hundred miles to get back  to camp and made it, of course, just in time for Reveille. (Laughs)  Honestly, some of the things we did were, well, they were just uncanny.  I had no business hitchhiking from Sacramento to Santa Ana on a  weekend.  Well, when you retired from work, did you do any traveling, or did you...  25  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Bishop  Finchum  Bishop  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  From work, you mean now     Yes.     my retirement now?  Yes.  Well, before you say that, where did you retire from?  Yes, yes.  From  George E.  Failing  Company , Failing   s Machine Shop.  And what did they manufacture?  They manufactured well-drilling equipment, water well drilling and deep  oil drilling. They did both. I was supervisor, not supervisor. I had to buy  all the parts.  Purchaser?  I worked with the purchasing agent, and I would inventory and purchase  all the parts and the handmade parts. There   s 3,500 parts, handmade, that  I had to schedule and have made in the machine shop.  How many years did you work for that company?  Thirty-five years. Can you imagine? Retirement from one of the  retirement programs is thirty-five dollars. Something was bought and  sold several times during my internship there, and so one of the  companies, the retirement from it, was  112, and the other one was  35.  That   s all the retirement I got, but I had a huge social security. That was  really something because I had worked an extra  four  years.  So you retired when?  I retired in    78, in    78 and then I went back to work with them until    82.  That   s only four years, isn   t it?  Yes.  Anyway, I had four more years working for them. I was an advisor for  them for the next four years in that same office. I could never figure out  why they couldn   t get along without me, but they never could pay me  26  Bishop  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  enough to keep me. (Laughter) I kept fighting them. One time I told my  boss, I says,    I   m going to get transferred to the burr bench.    That   s  where they take the sharp edges off of parts.    I want to get transferred to  the burr bench. He gets paid more than I do. He was on the union, and  they had union rules.    He gets paid real good, but me,    I says,    he gets  paid more than I do, and I   m going to transfer to the burr bench.    About  that time he got me a little raise, not much, but some. (Laughter)  Well, when you retired did you travel, or what did you do? What was  retirement like for you?  Oh, well, let   s see. Retirement couldn   t come until   well, after my wife  retired from teaching we did take a trip. She wanted to see the town  where she first taught school, where they had no marriage and had to go  to church and everything. That was Cromwell, Nebraska   Cromwell,  Oklahoma. You can tell I   m getting my instances all tangled up.  Anyway, so I says,    Okay, we   ll go see Cromwell.    We did and looked  it all over. She talked to the current superintendent or super professor,  the superintendent. I never did keep those titles separate. I never did  figure them out. I didn   t ever give it enough time. Anyway, we talked to  him awhile, took off, and came back home. She would not let me go to  any other town where there might be something that she would like to  see or do. She wouldn   t do that. We went to Cromwell, turned around,  and came back all in one day, all in one day on a weekend.  Later we decided to go to Branson, Missouri. I says,    That   d be a lot of  fun to do that.    She says,    Well, we could do that,    so we bottled  everything up and went to Branson. I says,    We better get a motel room  or hotel room or something after we get there because we   ll be going to  shows and things.    She says,    No, I   m not going to stay in a motel. I  don   t like to sleep in this hill country.    She says,    I   m afraid to sleep in  hill country.    I says,    Okay.    We went to one of the shows, and instead  of going to a motel we drove down to Bentonville. Is that where it was?  Benson? Bentonville? Anyway, it was flatland, so we stayed there  (laughter) and came on home the next day. She just would not leave  town, and she wouldn   t go to Fairview for any reason. She wouldn   t go  to   well, she didn   t like to go to Tulsa, either, because it was hill  country. I   d just have to pry her loose to get her to go anywhere. She  liked to stay right here in town.  Did you ever think you   d make it to a hundred, ever live to be a  hundred?  I used to kid her about her mother who was out in a nursing home, and  she lived to be a hundred. I says to Maureen, I says one day,    You   re  going to live to be a hundred, and I   m going to live to be eighty-five.  27  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  That   s the way it looks to me.    She says,    I don   t want to live to be a  hundred,    and she didn   t. She was eighty-two, I think, or, no, eighty...  Anyway, she was born in 1915 and    96   she was eighty-one or eighty-two.  Anyway, that   s what she did. I got the hundred.  How did you celebrate?  Oh, you should   ve been here. It was fantastic. We had a two-day  celebration. We invited a California couple. It was supposed to have  been two or three couples from California, but only one could make it.  Had Colorado invited. Nebraska, we had two or three from Nebraska,   Texas , and Orlando, Florida. They all came. Then in Tulsa, of course,  and even had a invitation out to one in New York City, but she says she  couldn   t come because her husband was not feeling good. My eye  waters. It   s from a operation in my eye. Those are not tears, though they  should be. Oh, boy, and then what?  What do you think is your secret, or what has contributed to your long  life, your longevity?  Well, I really don   t know. It   s a combination of my being taken care of  when I was young, when I was a baby and when I was older. I was the  youngest for four years before my youngest brother was born. All  through grade school and high school, whenever I was ill, my mother  would take real good care of me, and I only had the doctor one time.  That was a fiasco because all he did was want to give me some kind of a  powder. That was the days when powders was a doctor   s remedy. I  could not take one, and I didn   t. I   m stubborn, very stubborn. When  there   s something that I don   t want to do, I don   t do. (Laughter)  That   s your secret, then   That is my secret. (Laughter) Anyway, I was taken care of when I was a  young man. I was always fed properly, and I never went without. Never  went hungry, never in my life. Lots of oatmeal and cornmeal and rice,  all kinds of grains. My dad would go out hunting, and he   d bring home  rabbits and prairie chickens and all kinds of good things. They   d go  fishing, and he   d bring home fish, too. Like I said, we never went  hungry, but we never had time to raise a garden. I guess we didn   t have  time. That was it. You   d think with four boys we would   ve been able to  put in a huge garden and raise a lot of vegetables, but we didn   t. Nobody  did in those days. May have raised a few potatoes and apples and stuff  like that, but they never went in for vegetables. I don   t know why. Like I  said, we never went hungry, and we never went cold, never without  some place to stay, to live. We always had a place to live.  28  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Did you smoke when you were in the military?  Yes. When I was twenty, I thought,    Well, everybody   s smoking,    and  my dad smoked. My mother wanted to, but she didn   t. My brothers, they  all smoked. I figured I should, too, so at twenty I started to take on a  cigarette here and there. That lasted all the way up to my retirement. I  had a heart attack at eighty-two, when I was eighty-two, which was  what, 19   whatever year it was.  Ninety-five?  I   m not going to figure it out.  Nintey-five?  No, the year was    82.  In 1982, he would   ve been sixty-nine.  Sixty-nine. Anyway, it was 1982, and I was sixty-nine, and I had a heart  attack. I had a garden that you wouldn   t believe. It was on the railroad,  along the railroad tracks, 120 feet long, and about thirty-five feet wide. I  planted everything you can think of, even broccoli, (laughs) and cabbage  and sweet potatoes and onions and garlic. I raised everything that I could  and gave away most of it because just my wife and I, we didn   t eat too  much. None of the kids or grandkids were living with us, but my wife   s  mother finally, we had to put her in one of our bedrooms. We took care  of her until she went to the nursing home. We finally had to take her to  the nursing home because we couldn   t take care of her, and that   s where  she stayed until she died.  So you quit smoking when you had your heart attack? You quit?  Yes, after 19     That   s a long time.  It was about 1950s when I  began . That was what, thirty years of  smoking? That was awful. We used to have fights. My wife would  accuse me of having cigarettes because she   d find debris in my pocket. It  was not tobacco. It was just debris from the wind and stuff, and it would  accumulate. When she washed my shirts, it would accumulate in my  pocket. Oh, she   d get mad. She   d threaten me with everything because  she thought I was lying. It was terrible.  Tough to quit.  29  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  I finally did win out, and I   ve been smoke-free ever since.  Good for you   I made my grandkids promise. Every time I talked to them. I   d say,    I  don   t want you to smoke or do any drugs or anything like that.     What motto or piece of advice would you give someone who wants to  live to a hundred?  All I can say is just hang in there and go with the flow. (Laughter)  Do you have anything left on your bucket list that you want to do?  My bucket list is that long, but I know I can   t do them, so I cross them  off. I wanted to go to Egypt. I wanted to see the pyramids. I wanted to  go to Paris. My daughter went to Paris with her husband, but I didn   t go.  I wasn   t invited. (Laughter)  She left you home. (Laughs)  She left me at home, yeah. My daughter has gone to Honolulu. She just  got back from Singapore just about a month ago, two months ago.  They   ve been on over to China. Jon has gone to Hawaii. I guess I told  you that. He   s been spending his time going back and forth to Orlando,  so that   s his tripping. That   s a necessity, and I praised him for that  because that   s the thing for him to do.  Well, what are some things you can do that are still on your list?  What things can I do?  Yeah, that   s still on your list.  There   s nothing on my list that I can do because my backyard is giving  me fits  It has gone to weeds. I   ve hired a horticulturist to take care of it,  and he   s sprayed it twice for weeds. Just this week it   s been sprayed  again for weeds. The weeds grow faster than ever. My flowers, I used to  have a lot of flowers out there, all kinds of iris and coreopsis and violets  and tulips. I said iris, but they   re what I like most because they   re the  easiest to grow. I planted a pecan tree, and the squirrels planted one for  me. (Laughter) That biggest one out there is a squirrel-planted one, and  it is tremendous. It had nuts on it one year, the biggest pecans I ever  saw. They were like that, but the squirrels got them. (Laughter) They   ve  been picking them ever since. They even pick them when they   re green.  30  Bishop  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Bishop  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  Finchum  Rummel  If history were to be written about you today, what would you want it to  say?  History?  Yes.  I don   t know. I would hesitate to say anything, anything worthy. I don   t  know. I don   t know what I would say.  What would you want it to say about you, or how would you want to be  remembered?  Well, I   ll tell you what one of my granddaughters, my only  granddaughter   s husband   he wrote the nicest commentary that I have  ever seen. I saved it. I don   t know that I have it or not. I should take time  to look for it because it is something that you should read. Let   s see.  Anyway, he just went on and on, and he thought I was the most  generous person that he ever met. He thought I was the most thoughtful,  generous person that he ever met. I thought,    Well, that   s nice to say  that,    but I didn   t think I was being that thoughtful because of my  presents that I   ve been sending them. Every Christmas I send them a big  check, each one of them. That   s what prompted that. (Laughter) I have a  motive behind it. I   d rather give it to the kids and grandkids than to pay  income tax on it when it gets divided up as an inheritance. I   m just not  going to give Uncle Sam any of it. I can give it to the kids without them  having to pay anything on it.  And see them enjoy it, yes.  It makes me happy. It makes me happy. I don   t know, I just, I don   t  know. I don   t know what I can say without being egotistical. I really  don   t know anything. I just want to be remembered as a great  grandfather, and I hope they remember me. They   re either too young   I  don   t think they   re going to remember me much, but that   s all right. I  can remember them     That   s right.     forever and ever.  Well, that   s a good place to stop. I thank you very much for sharing your  stories with us.  I am happy to do it (laughs) if it helps you any.  31  Finchum  Rummel  You were great. Thank you very much.  You   ll be surprised when I cross out half of it. (Laughter)  -------  -------
