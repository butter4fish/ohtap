 Finchum  Rainwater  Today is July 1, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Cushing, Oklahoma, to speak with Mary Rainwater and this is part of  our Oklahoma 100 Year Life project so thank you for having us today.  It   s Marie.  Marie. I need to say that again. Marie Rainwater.  I thought you said Mary.  I probably did, or my Tennessee accent   s coming in there. Marie  Rainwater.  Right.  All right. So let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were  born.  I was born on a farm north of Ripley, Oklahoma, on February 21 in  1912.  During the winter. Was it stormy that day? Do you know?  Oh it was, I   ll tell you what. My father had to ride a horse two miles to  call the doctor to come out in the country. When he got there, there   d  been big snowstorms, and there were drifts up our driveway, and his  little horses wouldn   t pull him up. He was kind of a fat fellow. Finally  my dad got him up to the porch, and they couldn   t get him off of the  buggy and to the porch. Finally Dad went in and got a blanket and  wrapped around him and rolled him over onto that porch. We   ve  5  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  laughed about that for years, about how the doctor got there.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  I have a mother that   s named Florence Knotts Sherrill, and my dad was  Frank James Sherrill. I had an older brother, George Sherrill, that was  six years older than me, and then I was the next child. Then my next one  was a boy, and he was three years younger than I. The next was a girl  and  my other sister was twelve years older than I . I always say that us  girls were six years apart. Then the last child was a little boy, but he died  in infancy.  Okay.  And so there were three boys and three girls, of us.  Okay, and what did your parents do for a living?  Well, my dad was a farmer, and my grandfather had come down and  made the  Land  Run up at Glencoe. He didn   t like the one he chose, so  he went down there north of Ripley and found the place that he wanted.  He bought 640 acres for  1,400, and that was in 1895. They moved  down on that farm, and my grandfather was a carpenter and a bricklayer  and all like that. He built a house up there, just a little claim house you  might say, and that   s where we started in farming. Grandfather raised  cattle. He ran lots of cattle. Dad didn   t want to fool with the cattle, so he  got rid of them, and he was a wheat farmer. We lived out there on that  farm until, I guess, we went to town when I was a senior in high school.  And where did you go to elementary school?  I went to a little  school  where they taught eight grades all in one room,  and there was about twenty of us students. This woman was really nice.  She really knew how to take care of kids. I went there the first two years,  and then our little school consolidated with Ripley, and they sent buses  out and collected the children and took them in. My dad took me to  school the first day, and he told the teacher (they were just standing  there listening to him) he said,    Now, she   s been at a little rural school  all this time, and I don   t think she   s prepared to go into the third grade.  I   d like to keep her this year in the second grade again.    This teacher  looked at me and says,    Oh no. Let   s let her try, and if she can make it, I  will let her go on in the third grade.    So that   s how I started in this  school. Well, it didn   t take me long to prove to them that I was capable  of going into the third grade.  What would you take for your lunch? Do you remember?  6  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Oh Lord yes, a lunch box. We lived on the farm where we had all kinds  of fruit trees and Mother raised turkeys and chickens and all like that.  Mother cooked the best donuts, and I can still taste them, and put in our  lunches. She had us a good lunch every day. She believed that feeding  you was showing her love for you. I never suffered from not having  enough food.  Did you have chores on the farm?  Well, I had chores. I was to help Mother with the other children, and to  this day the other children say that I was bossy and they really tell me  off every once in a while, that I   d been bossy with them. Mother would  say,    Now Marie, you take care of the children.    Well, if I saw them  doing something that would hurt them or something I absolutely told  them,    You quit that.    So I did take care of them just a little. The  youngest girl, I practically reared her because Mother lost the baby   after  her and she was in poor health, and so it was,    Marie, you take  care of the little baby that we have now.    And that was my chore. To  this day she lives over here about six blocks from me. She   s ninety years  old, and we just talk everyday on the phone a hundred times.  Did you have to wash her diapers, or was that your mother   s job?  No, Mother usually was there on the wash day, and it was me to hang  them up and things like that.  Okay. Did she raise a big garden?  A big, big garden and she also raised all these turkeys and chickens. We  had fried chicken except one month of the year.  And what month was that?  Oh, nothing wrong with it, I   ll tell you.  What month did she skip?  Oh, I think it was in June.  Hmm. Any particular reason why?  Oh something about getting the chickens she bought. She bought them at  the nursery, you know, and then by the time she   d get them up to the  size where they were eatable I believe it was June.  7  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Well, after the elementary school you went to Ripley High School, I  guess?  Yes I did. And the thing about it, they consolidated and got in a lot of  other schools. The year that I was a senior, there were only four of us  seniors, so that kind of put a   well it was one big class. Then here was  this little class of four, but we had a good time as we went through.  What year did you graduate?  Nineteen thirty.  Depression time.  I   ll say it was Depression time. We, of course, lived on that farm.  Nobody had any clothes extra or anything like that, but everybody  looked after other people. I thought this morning, I don   t have a middle  name, but it should have been Share, S-H-A-R-E. I never enjoyed  anything if I had it and didn   t share it with somebody else. That   s the  way I   ve been all my life. I just feel terrible to think,    Here I have this,  and I   m sitting here by myself.    I just love to share things with people.  I   m glad you   re sharing your story with us.  Well, a lot of people wouldn   t do it, you know.  They wouldn   t. Well, was church an important part of your growing up?  It was the most important part. Out in the farm we didn   t have any  churches, and there was a little church up on the top of a hill that was  about five miles from our home. They   d have a revival of one week in  the summer. Well, every night we got in that little surrey, the kids, and  my grandmother lived with us, my dad   s mother, and Mother and Dad.  We drove a team of horses, and I was afraid to come home at night. I   d  sit up in the   I was a daddy   s girl. I sat up in the seat with my father,  and I   d say,    Dad, how come these horses know when to turn?    Dad  would say,    Well, I just pull a line when I want them to go that way.     And so I kept a worrying about that. I was afraid someone was going to  run into us. The second night we went, Dad tied a lantern on the front  horse, and then I didn   t worry anymore. I thought,    That lantern   s going  to save us.    (Laughter)  That was pretty smart for your father to do that.  Why yeah, Dad always looked out for me because I just trailed around  with him. Most of the time I didn   t care about playing with dolls and all  8  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  that. I   d rather been out seeing the calves and the horses and things like  that.  Do you remember if that particular horse had a name that took you to  the church and back?  Well, we had one that was called Rome, and then my brother had a  palomino. It was a beautiful horse, was a riding horse, and just now that  name left me. I don   t know.  That   s okay. Is the farm still in the family?  It is. My sister owns the original farm, eighty acres. They sold off all the  land and got down to 160 acres, and one of the eighty belonged to my  dad. Well, and when he died he left us children   I mean the other eighty  had gone to my aunt. My sister then, when my father died and my  mother died, she and I together bought the surface right of this eighty  over here. Then later on when I was teaching and all, my aunt was going  to sell her portion. She lived in California, and she didn   t need the land,  so I bought that. I own the eighty here, and my sister owns the eighty  here.  I must tell you something. They got to leasing, and they   re just leasing  everything in Payne County and drilling. I   ve never seen nothing like it.  It   s always been oil drilling and everything. Well, we have a well on the  old home place that   s produced oil since 1970, but I know that a lot of  times we didn   t get all of our oil check. That   s just a proven fact. It got  to the point they said it only made six barrels a day. Now, since they  sold it to another company, we got a pretty good sizable check out of  that well this year. The six children still own the royalty under that.  I own all the royalty under my eighty, and they   ve been wanting to     they first wanted to lease it, and I said,    All right.    They offered  everybody else  X  dollars an acre. I told my grandson that lives in  California that they were leasing land, and he said,    Now Grandmother,  you   ve no business leasing that at your age. You just let me come back  there and lease it.    I said,    Gee, I never have had to have someone else  do something for me.    I went on, and I got  X + 1.5X  dollars an acre for  that. That really brought in a good income with that. (Laughs) Then I  called my grandson, and I said,    I leased the land,    and he said,    Well,  did you just give it away?    I said,    No, I got the top price.     Good for Grandma   Now they   re sending out letters. I   ve received twelve from different oil  companies wanting to buy my royalty under that eighty. Well, you know  9  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  they know there   s something good there. There   s been a well there once,  and that   s what I sent my grandson to college on, was this old well  pumping. Then they closed it during those   those little skimpy wells,  and they shut them all down. I   ve got the letters in there where twelve  oil companies have sent me a   and one person said,    What do you want  for that?    I said,    I don   t want, because I do not intend to sell.    Another  man called, and he was kind of snippy. He said,    What if I   d offer you a  million dollars an acre? Would you take it?    I said,    No, because I don   t  need the money right now and I   m going to keep that royalty. If it   s  worth that to you, then it   s worth more to me.    So I still have the old  royalty and the old farm, and my sister   s got the other one.  They don   t mess with you, huh?  I   ll tell you, the thing about it is, I   ve always had a feeling that you got  to look out for yourself and you got to plan ahead and things like that.  So many people wait until an emergency comes, and they don   t know  what to do. My dad always told us one thing. He said,    The Lord helps  those who help themselves.    This old grandmother, she was a real  charger. One day she said,    I   m telling you kids one thing. If the Lord be  with you, who can be against you?    You know that has carried true,  those two things. All my life when I get in a tight  spot  I think,    If the  Lord be with you, who can be against you?    The other was that you earn  what you work for. And I got to say another thing. Talking about  scholarships, there wasn   t a thing in my time growing up such as a  scholarship. You never heard of it, so I never had any scholarship or  anything like that to start my college with.  Speaking of that, let   s back up. You graduated from high school in 1930.  Yes.  Then what did you do?  Well, the funny thing was that my dad and mother had sent my brother  off to college, and two weeks before he graduated from business school  he jumps up and goes off and gets married. That disappointed them.  They said,    There we sent George to college and all, had great  expectations, and here he gets up and married.    Well, I came along and I  wanted to go to college, and they weren   t going to send me to college. I  said,    I   m not going to live out here on this old farm and be a farmer   s  wife and work like a slave in this old farm. I   m not going to do it.     I went over to town and asked the woman at the telephone office if she  had anything for me to do in the way of telephone, and she said yes. She  was a widow and had three little kids and lived in the office where the  10  Finchum  Rainwater  telephone was. She took me in, and I roomed with her. She taught me  how to operate the telephone switchboard. I didn   t think I was going to  college. One night my mother called me, or it was one morning, and she  said,    What are you doing?    I said,    I   m sitting here at the switchboard  watching the kids go to school.    I said,    Mother, I wish I could go to  school.    In a little bit she called me back and said,    Could you come out  and eat supper with your dad and I tonight?    I said yes. We hadn   t  gotten, I bet, five miles out of town until my dad said,    We   ve decided  to send you to school if you really want to go.    They sent me to Central  State because I   d had my application in to be a nurse at Saint Francis.  Dad didn   t think the nurses were supervised enough, and he wouldn   t let  me go. Then when I went to work for the telephone office, see, I was out  on my own.  When I went to school, I went with a tin suitcase with my clothes, was  all I had to go down to college. I didn   t have a lot of clothes. We was in  that Depression. I went down there, and my dad found a place that I  could room and board with some people he knew. They paid for my  room and board a month and put me in down there. I was in a house with  fourteen other girls, and most of them were juniors and seniors. I was  glad I got in with those kids because they took me up the next morning  to enroll, and they knew who were the hard professors and who were the  easy ones, and they got me all enrolled. I was real happy with going to  school with all those older girls.  Then one day I got so lonesome for the family. I was homesick, and I  decided I was going to quit school to go home. I got my clothes out and  put them in this little suitcase, and I was sitting on the bed. One of the  senior girls came home. She saw me and said,    What are you doing,  Marie?    I said,    I   ve packed up. I   m going home.    She said,    My lands,  you don   t want to do that.    So she came in and gave me a good talking  to and said,    If you go home, then your family won   t send any of the  other kids to school because you and your brother   s both been a failure.     I rolled that over in my mind a couple times, and I thought,    I don   t want  that to be a stumbling block for the rest of them.    I pulled my clothes  out, hung them up. That   s the last time I decided to quit school.  (Laughter)  What was your major?  Well, at first I took just elementary education because I wanted to get a  teaching certificate so I could get out and start making money myself. So  I got a, for one year I got a two-year teaching certificate to teach one to  eight grades. Now before that, if you were a high school graduate, you  could take a test, and if you passed it, they   d give you a certificate to  teach one year. Several of my friends did that, but I didn   t. Then I started  11  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  in. I   d take Saturday classes over at OSU, or I   d take an extension  course. I worked all the time trying to get   finally I got a bachelor   s  degree from Central State. I wasn   t contented with that. I wound up in     I had these little second graders. I got so I   d talked like one. Well, you  had to communicate with them. I thought,    I acted like a second grader.     I said,    I   m going to get out of this,    so I went in teaching business  subjects. I got my first degree in elementary, and the second degree was  in secondary with a major in business subjects. Then I got the job of  teaching shorthand and bookkeeping and typing, and all like that.  I taught there  Ripley  for nineteen years: two years in the elementary  and the rest of them in this high school. I, of course, then got married,  and I got dissatisfied with the school. They   d just fire one teacher after  another. Never threatened me, but I was always sympathetic with the  one they did. Finally I told my husband, I said,    I   m going to get out of  here.    I applied over here at Cushing, and, by golly, they hired me to be  the business teacher and the financial secretary. I came over here, and  everything was new and such a big school. When those lockers began to  clink I thought,    What have I gotten into?    Everybody was just as nice  as they could be to me. I taught nineteen years here, and I finally told  them I wasn   t going to keep that financial secretary. That was just a  headache. They   d just come in and want a check, and then they   d want  to deposit money. I couldn   t get any satisfaction out of them. Finally I  told them I wouldn   t teach that so they gave me   I wanted the high  school counseling, and that   s what I took my master   s in. When I got my  master   s, I became the high school counselor for nine years here. That   s  what I really loved.  Was that from OSU?  Yes.  Your master   s? Do you remember what year you got that?  Oh gosh, it was in   why it   s so hard for me to remember that is because  I went on the board of the National Rural  Letter  Carriers Auxiliary.  Rural carriers?  Yes, rural carriers. There was 22,000 women belonged when I was in  there. I was on that board five years, and I taught. I   d go in there to Mr.  Carr, the superintendent, and I   d say    Mr. Carr, I   m going to have to be  off now for a couple days.    He   d look at me and say,    Get a substitute,     and that   s all. I   ve thought lots of times, imagine me going into the  superintendent and say,    I   m going to be gone for a couple of days.    He  seemed to enjoy it, promote me.  12  Finchum  Rainwater  How did you get involved with the rural mail carriers?  Well, that is really a story. My husband, when I married him, he was a  pharmacist. He was a pharmacist down in Spiro, Oklahoma. I met him  on a vacation, and we went together (I mean over the phone) for about  two years. Then finally we got married. He was working here in the  drugstore in Cushing. I told him, I said,    That   s a terrible thing.    He  went to the war and was gone thirty-eight months. Back and forth he   d  come, once in a great while, when he   d have furlough. This woman at  the post office, I kept joking. I went in there practically every morning to  mail Rial a letter, and I said,    I want your job.    She was a former  teacher, and she just sat at that window and gave out mail. She was jolly  and everything. I said,    I want that job when you retire.    When she  retired, she called me and said,    Now, Marie, I   m going to retire, and I  can send your application in with mine. I know I can get it for you.    I  said,    Let me think of it tonight.     I went home and told Rial because he   d come back with a frozen foot  and leg he got behind the lines. I said,    Now, there   s your chance. Go in  with the rural letter carrier because the man that was going to retire is a  rural carrier.    Sure enough, I went back next morning. I said,    Ms.  Schoop, I don   t want that job, but Rial would like to change jobs  because of his injury to his foot.    She said,    Oh I   d as soon him have it  as you,    so he got the assistant postmaster to begin with, and he was  always so kind. He took an active part in whatever he belonged to. He  got to going, and he was elected on their state board. I got to going, and I  enjoyed it because most of the women were real educated, secretaries  and things like that, I mean for that time.  Next thing you know, I was going with him and was such a nice crowd,  and I enjoyed it. Rial went on to state president, and then here I came on  behind him as the auxiliary president. That was one of the most  enjoyable things I ever did because when I was president I had a thyroid  operation. It was cancer. They nominated me for the board, and  somebody got that and said,    She won   t live long enough to finish that.     Well, that next year I ran again, and I got it. My national convention was  at the Statler Hilton Hotel in Boston. The main speaker was a man that  had so much to do with diabetes. I took, for my money-raising, cancer  research, and I took for my   oh, I don   t know what you call it, whatever  it is they take for some kind of deal they work. Mine was seeing that  every child that was a rural carrier   s child was tested for diabetes  because they said that so many children had it that didn   t know it. We  tested, and I bet you that 90 percent of those children we tested had  diabetes. I thought that was the one good deed that was done, was to get  those children all in and get them tested for diabetes.  13  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum   The year I went  off the  Auxiliary Board  Rial was elected to the  national board, and he went on through. When he was  a national  officer , we had to go live in Washington DC. We lived up there five  years. I love history. I just hunted up everything. I belonged to DAR   Daughters of the American Revolution  and all that and proved my  history way back when. Then while we were up there, of course, I just  went to see everything I could, and I kept a grandson every summer for  five summers. All we did was get around and go to the museums and the  libraries and what have you. I think that made a good student out of him  because he traveled with us. I know I got off the subject, but     No that   s fine. I was just trying to   how did that fit into being a  schoolteacher? Was this after you had retired from teaching, or was this  during?  Oh it was during the school     During.  How in the world that I could keep on the national board for five years,  and in the summer I had five state conventions I had to visit.  I don   t know. How did you do it?  I don   t know sometimes now. I think that may be why I   m so worn out,  (Laughs) but really that   s just, I had to get everything in place.  A good time manager.  Yes, and I and Rial enjoyed this travel because we loved to travel  together.  Did he actually ever deliver the mail?  Oh Lord, he did. He went out in the country. He had a 100-mile route,  and he delivered those papers, see, to everybody out on the mailboxes.  When it was bad weather, boy, he really hated it because it was terrible  to deliver the mail and it   s raining, muddy roads. You   d get stuck, and  everything else happened to him, but I did. I managed it. I had help at  home to clean the house and things like that. Boy, I had everything just  so-so.  Well, when you moved from Ripley to Cushing   or did you still live in  Cushing and drive back and forth? I mean Ripley, live in Ripley and  drive back and forth?  14  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  We had a nice home in Ripley, and so we came over here and rented an  apartment. We   d come over here and stay all week and then go back  over there. We had Lereta, our only daughter, was with us. Then we   d  go back over there. We hated to sell our home over there. We   d intended  to really make it a place really nice. Finally we decided,    Why not sell  it?    Then we bought a home over here and moved over here. We   ve  been here since.  We went to Edmond after we came back from civil service in DC. We  went to Edmond or Oklahoma City and lived three years down there. I  didn   t like it. Everywhere you had to go it was crowded and everything,  so we came back. My mother was getting old. I told Rial   he wanted to  go to Stillwater. That   s where he wanted to go, but I talked him out of it  because Mother lived here. We built this house here rather than build in  Stillwater.  And that was about what year?  Let   s see now. When was that? My gosh, we came back from there in  1970, and we lived three years in Oklahoma City. We came back here in   1974  and built this house.  What was Ripley like when you were a youngster, the town itself?  Oh my gosh, it was little. You could walk all over it, but that was one  thing that got me started right. There   s a little Church of God over on the  corner right across from our house. In those days, Mother wasn   t a bit  afraid to let me go any night over there to that church. I   ve always been  a person that seeks knowledge. I want to know what   s going on. Also,  I   d go over there, and I was only an eleven- and twelve-year-old child. I  would sit and listen to those mostly old, gray-haired people on prayer  meeting nights. They   d get up and testify what the Lord had done for  them and all. I   d sit there and listen to that night after night, and  sometimes I   d think to myself,    Now, has that really happened to them,  or are they just telling that to make themselves look really big in the  church that they go to?    At that time, that church didn   t believe in  doctoring. We saw many a funeral of a woman that had died in  childbirth.  One night they had a revival, and I went. I don   t know why, but before I  knew it I was crying. I went up to the altar, and this gray-haired lady that  I   d known all my life, she came there, and she prayed for me and all.  She said,    Now, Marie, you   ll be a better person.    I thought of that. So  then they came over the next day and wanted me to join the church and  put in my membership. I said,    I can   t do it,    and she wanted to know  15  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  why. I said,    Because I can   t be a hypocrite.    I said,    I believe in  doctoring, and I   m going to a doctor. Here if I tell people that I belong to  this church, it just don   t make sense.    So I never would join that church,  I mean on their book work, but that is where I made up, that night and  then the next week or two following, certain resolutions that I was going  to live by the rest of my life, and nobody helped me make them up. One  was, I wouldn   t drink. Another was, I wasn   t going to ever lie. Well, that  was something unheard of in my family. My dad would   ve beat us to  death if I   d lied to him and things like that. It   s that little church that I  was twelve years old that I made these resolutions to myself.  Well, then after I got married, my husband, we   re up there. We went to  cocktail parties and all. The other two women that were in there were  farm people, too. They were just like me. They got so they   d have a  cocktail all going around, and I wouldn   t. Well, they decided that they  were going to break me down and they was going to teach me to drink.  The national secretary was sitting by me one night, and he said,    Now,  Marie, I   m going to order you a cocktail that you   ll just love,    and he  ordered it. I just let it sit there and deteriorate right in front of him.  One time they got me in a convention, and we were having to meet. The  women were in a bar, and it was up in Maine. They called me up to the  bar and gave me a Coke and then took a picture and said,    Now we can  show people that Mrs. Rainwater was drinking.    I said,    My enemies  will love that, but my people who are friends will know better than that,  so just show the picture all you want to.    It   s just something like that. I  mean I went from one thing to another. I was always trying to raise up a  step up higher or doing something different. I didn   t want to stay in the  teaching profession until I just got so old they threw me out. I   d take on  these new challenges.  Well, had someone in your life been doing that, too, that you were  mentored or anyone you looked up to did that?  No, that was the funny part of it. My mother never, she never was a  president of anything. Every time I could join an organization, I   ve  somewhere rather filtered to the top and became the president of the  organization. I belonged to DAR, the Eastern Star, and the White Shrine,  and the   oh I don   t know whatever, all the PTAs  Parent Teacher  Association , and OEA  Oklahoma Education Association , NEA   National Education Association , and I have fifty-year pins from the  Rural Carriers Auxiliary. I have fifty-year pins from my church. That  takes a lot of going. (Laughs)  That takes a lot. Well, what was Cushing like back in those early days?  16  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Well, it was an oil boomtown, and it didn   t lack for excitement here. It  was a new town, and the oil was just a flowing. Nobody had any hard  luck over here at that time. It was really a thriving town. It went kind of  on a slump, and now it   s coming back. Here we got this tank farm out  here. See, it   s the world   s largest tank farm. Oh, those big truckers that   s  bringing in oil here, they come in of the morning, and they   re just like  chickens coming in here. They draw off their load, and they   re going  back in the evening. We   ve counted them. One time I counted them  going to Stillwater, and we counted going and coming. We counted  thirty of those big tankers. Cushing really hasn   t suffered at all for this  downplay. Now it   s a hard time to try to find a place to buy here.  This pasture across from us here, they   re starting to survey the streets.  They   re going to make that into a new addition over there, all that whole  block. I don   t know. We had something here   this was all an elderly  group here when we came out here. The other night they broke in a  house just three doors down, robbed it, just stripped it. The man was  gone, and they came up here to the driveway and this car next door and  they broke into it, stripped it. It   s getting to be where we   re just worried  all the time because we have dope, dope, dope. That   s what Cushing   s  having to fight now.  Changed a lot, then.  Yeah, yeah, it does.  I understand your father was musical?  Oh Lord, that   s a story all by itself. Do you want to hear it?  I do.  I   ll tell you what, Dad was an old-time fiddler. He had a beautiful violin,  and he drank some, and he   d play for dances. My mother was bitterly  opposed to it. It got Dad in trouble over it, so Dad sold his violin, gave it  up. Told Mother he wouldn   t drink anymore and all, so everything  quieted down. Then we moved to Ripley, and Dad took a job with an oil  company. We were doing real well. We leased the old farm for seventy-five  dollars an acre. All we left the farmhouse with was just our clothes  and our bedding. We bought all new furniture and everything for the  house in Ripley.  Dad worked twelve-hour work. He worked twelve hours and then would  go sleep and then twelve hours without a rest. They   d go down to this  old barber shop there in town. One night a man brought a violin in, and  Dad said,    Let me see that.    He whooped off a tune, and they just  17  Finchum  Rainwater  thought it was wonderful.    Play another     So he did. Every night they   d  go down there in that barber shop. One man ran back and got his banjo,  and another got a mandolin, and another got a guitar. First thing you  know, they had a little band going.  Well, in that time, they   d just opened up KFRU  Radio  down here at  Bristow, the first radio that was here in Oklahoma. What they   d do,  they   d give you an hour   s time if you   d come there and play a musical  thing so that they could advertise this new radio station. Dad and a man  got in the car and went down to Bristow and talked to them, and they got  an hour to play, to advertise it. They were the first cowboy band to play  on the airways. We got that old recording. I   ve had a real battle with  some of them that wanted to cheat Dad out of that glory. I said,    You   re  not going to do it.    Finally we got in such a rile there in Ripley (I was  over here then) that they sent one of the chief newsmen from Oklahoma  City, The Oklahoman, up here. He investigated all of them, and he wrote  a big article in The Oklahoman and said,    The only thing that Mrs.  Rainwater had ever quoted that wasn   t right was the fact that she called  the first band the Frank Sherrill Cowboy Band. The best I can research  it, it was called the Old Time Fiddlers.    Now, that   s all he could find  was wrong with mine.  My dad quit them because they wanted him to go to New York and play  at the Square Gardens. He and his men all had jobs, and they couldn   t go  off, and leave their family, up there. Then a bunch of kids and got on  and called it then The Cowboy Band, Bill McGinty   s Cowboy Band that  went off playing. Dad and them old original    Cowboy Band    went down  there and said,    They   re shysters.    (Laughs) Now, they had quite a time.  They said they had a big lawsuit over that, someone taking up their  name, going out to play. I know I   m talking too much.  No, you   re doing fine.  Oh, I played the piano, and my mother played the guitar, and one brother  played a bass fiddle. Among us kids and my dad and mother, we had a  band of our own, and we still lived across from this little church. Mother  wouldn   t let Dad play while they had any kind of church services over  there, but as soon as this church was over, Dad would strike up the band.  (Laughter) Here are these people (we had a double porch) on one side of  the house. I mean it was out here in front of the bedroom, and a big  porch out here in front of the living room. Those people, all of them I  think, would come over and sit on those porches and listen to my dad  play until it would be, oh, eleven o   clock. My mother would get up and  say,    Now, you   re going to quit playing. You know you   ve got to work  tomorrow.    She   d make him quit playing, and then they   d all leave. I  mean, it was something. It just filled your soul with the music. I loved  18  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  that old Bob Wills when he started up, see. That   s the same kind of  music my dad had played. I just loved that old music.  Well, how did he learn how to play the fiddle?  Well, his father was known in the old time   they learned everything by  ear. I don   t know how they did it, but my grandfather was one of the best  ol    fiddlers in the country. He had played, and these boys   he had two  of them, and they played, see, just from memory  Dad could sit and  listen at a tune, a new one, and he could just fiddle in a minute and have  that tune and, boy, off he   d go. These people would learn the guitar and  things like that just   . Some of them had lessons and all. Dad told me  that he   d get me a piano if he got a series of wets. That   s where the well  was blowing out, and they had to wear slickers and all. They paid him  well for that, setting the well in. He said,    If I make enough money this  month I will buy you a new piano,    which he did. Then I started taking  lessons and, gosh, here   s the little kids, little tykes, they   d sit down and  play. Here I was just starting. I wouldn   t take any lessons, so I just  learned from that few I had. I kind of taught myself, but I tell you, our  house was nothing but a place of music.  Well, did they dance, too, or was it just music?  Oh Lord, we had dances in the homes then. Then Dad and this band  went off to Ponca City and Guthrie and places like that and played for  these big oil dances. I know I went with them one time. A lot of times  this woman was there, pianist. She was a concert pianist. She was here  recuperating from some illness she had, with her father. She played with  those ol    boys all that time. She gave lessons on the side, and so that   s  where I got my start. And do you know that I later   two little girls that  lived out in the country, when I went back to live with my folks during  the war, these little girls wanted to take lessons, and nobody around to  do it. They wanted to know if I could just teach them how to start out. I  did. I taught those two girls all summer, two summers. By golly, one of  them ended up here at OSU, the accompanist for the chorale group and  all those kinds of things. I paid my dues there on that. (Laughs)  You   ve had your fingers in a lot of things, sounds like.  Oh, heck yes. My sister gets after me now because you can see all these  scrapbooks that I   ve got in here. I love to make scrapbooks, and I love  history. I   ve done a family history of the five generations on my mother  and father   s side on down. I   ve just happened to be lucky enough that I  saved my grandmother   s big old trunk full of old time pictures of the  family. I put in the pictures and all that, and I found one of my, oh, third  cousin down here in Texas. Her grandmother and my grandmother were  19  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Bishop  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  sisters. She   s down in Texas, and here we found each other. I happened  to have a picture of her grandmother, and so I sent it to her. Boy, was  she ever pleased with it.  Did any of them live to be 100, your grandparents and parents, live to be  100?  My mother   s mother lived to be  102 , just lacked two days of hitting   102 . That   s what I kept aiming for. I wanted to be the one that had  more years to my life than that. Sure enough, I have now. I   ve already  passed six months in the third year, so when it goes over to February I   ll  have 103.  So what are you aiming for now?  Well, I first aimed for 105, and now since I   m doing so well, I said,     Why not put it up to a 110?    (Laughter)  Why not?  Did you ever think that you   d live to be 100?  No sir. I never did, but I kept wanting to because that grandmother was  so braggy about it, that she lived so long. I wanted to show the family  that there was someone else that could live long, too.  A little bit competitiveness, then?  Yeah, oh it is. The Dust Bowl, I can remember those ol    dust storms and  the poor little kids I taught. I had thirty-some little second graders, and  they   d come to school without any shoes on their feet hardly. They   d put  pasteboard in under their feet to keep them off the ground. A lot of them  came to school and didn   t have any school lunch, but their folks wanted  them to go get an education. The woman that was teaching the third  grade, one day I was sitting and talking to her. She finished her  sandwich half, and she threw the other half in the wastebasket. I knew  there were two little boys sitting out under the window that hadn   t had  anything to eat, that was in her room. I picked the sandwich up, and I  went out and leaned over the window, and I said,    Boys, half this.    I  came back, and she said,    Now, Marie Rainwater, you don   t really think  I   m going to start feeding my kids like you do yours?    I just thought,     Girl, you won   t receive the rewards I do for being nice and kind to  these kids.     Now I have some of those people that I taught. I   ve got a second grader  living right across the road from me that   s just so good to go with me  20  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  and help me when we go out on trips or something. There   s six of them,  and I   m going to have them for a luncheon this summer. Those six are  still living, and they   re up in their seventies. Some of them may be  eighty. I always did that. See, we lived on a farm. I   d get up of the  morning, and I   d tell Mother and Dad about how pitiful these children  were, about not having anything. Mother would take a big ol    brown  bag   if we had had fried chicken the night, what was left over, she   d fix  it and put it in there. We always had apples and pears and things like  that, and she   d fill that ol    sack up. Then I   d tell these kids,    Now, come  up here if you don   t have anything, and we   ll have a picnic.    They   d get  up around my desk, and I   d feed them at noon.  Finally, one time I sent a note to some mothers that I knew were well to  do enough that they could afford to send cookies or something, and said  we was going out to the ball diamond to have a picnic on Friday  afternoon. Well, come Friday morning it was raining, and so noon we  couldn   t go. I told the kids, I said,    Just gather around my desk, and  we   ll have the picnic. Bring what you have, or anything.    When we got  all ready to eat I looked back, and there   s three, a little boy and two little  girls. His mother had sent us a cake, a whole cake. He had that cake in  front of him, and these two little girls, one had fried chicken and another  one had something else. I said,    Aren   t you coming up here to join the  picnic?    Harry said,    No, we   re going to eat our stuff here.    I said,     You   d better come up here and eat with us. Your mother sent that to  share.    Nope, they weren   t going to do it. I said,    All right.    All during  our meal I kept thinking,    What can I do to teach those three kids a  lesson?     When we were almost through eating, I gave the money to a little boy,  and I said,    You go down to the drugstore,    (I counted how many I had)     and get popsicles,    because the kids all loved that. He went down and  got this sack of popsicles, and he came back. I started handing them out.  Harry and Louise and this other little girl ran up to the desk to get theirs.  I ran out when I got to them. Harry said,    Why won   t you give me one?     I said,    No, you didn   t go on the picnic with us, so I didn   t order one for  you.    He just cried, and I bet you those kids never forgot that. I taught  them a lesson right there. I showed them that if you don   t share with  other people, then you don   t expect to be shared with.  I   m surprised they let you send a kid out of the school to town to get the  popsicles.  No, in those days you were the head of that classroom. You could do  anything. You took care of them yourself.  That was during the   40s, during the war?  21  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Bishop  Rainwater  That was in   I started teaching in    32, so this had to be in    32 through     34, somewhere in that.  Before you got married?  Yes.  What were the war days like? Did your husband serve?  Yes, he served. He was a pharmacist. He went in the 43rd General  Hospital. It was awful. He saw so much suffering of people and  everybody   s getting a    Dear    letter about someone who was missing in  action or killed in action and everything. I was pregnant when he went  overseas, so I went back out to farm with my dad and mother. I stayed  with them, and of course I quit teaching during that time. Lereta was  born, and she didn   t see her dad until she was, like, two days of being  two years old.  You can   t imagine what it was like. I was worried all the time about  him. I went over to Stillwater and had Lereta there at the Stillwater  hospital. My brother lived there in Stillwater, and they wouldn   t let me  go home unless I   d go in an ambulance. My dad said,    You   re dying.     They kept me eleven days in the hospital. Lereta and I went home, and  somebody brought us in the flu. They wanted to see the baby, and they  didn   t care if they had the flu. They came to see her. I could have shot  them if I   d known who it was. (Laughter)  Just imagine, in war time we didn   t have any electricity. We didn   t have  any water out there on the farm. One morning the cows got out. These  men were working down there on this well that was on there now. I told  Mother. Mother said,    They   ve got to get in because they   ll scatter all  over the country.    I told her I   d get in the car and go down and drive it.  It was frozen, the ground was. I got out, and I was trying to herd those  cattle and bahonking the horn and all. These oilfield workers saw me.  They came over and said,    You go back up to the house. We   ll get these  cattle in for you.    People in those days, they would help you in most  anything and another thing. These scholarships didn   t start for kids in  college.  I never heard of a scholarship, see. You either had to get it on your own  or you didn   t get it, but thank God we had OSU. I knew it when it was   Oklahoma  A M  College . You see, I took mine, all my electives, in  history and economics. When I got ready to graduate down at Central  State, I went there to graduate because that   s where I had most of my  hours. They called me that morning and told me to come in to   oh, the  22  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  fellow that goes over and checks all of us. I went in, and I was shivering.  I thought,    Gosh, I couldn   t have done something. I won   t graduate.     That was the year that they were growing, got so many to graduate. We  had 400-and-some kids graduating that summer and the...lost my  thought.  They were checking to see if you   d     Oh, yeah  I got up there, and they came out, and they had a major to  teach history and government. I didn   t even know I had it. I just took  those because I was always interested in those and I was good in it. I  could make a good grade, so I always took that. They wouldn   t ever let  me teach history over here in Cushing. I went in, and I wanted to take  the man   s place that was quitting. He was head of the history  department. I looked at this principal, (he and I was always good  friends) and I said,    And why don   t you want me to be over the history  department?    He said,    Because you   re too opinionated.    And I was.  I had been an old redneck Democrat all my life because the way I   ve  looked at it, that everything like rural electrification, social security, all  those things had been brought about by a democrat Congress or the  president was a Democrat. I feel like right now that if we hadn   t had a  joker   but we have a congress up there that has not done anything all  winter long. They   ve not passed a job bill, and why they won   t want  people that are out of work to have a job and things like that, I just can   t  understand it.  How do you keep up with that sort of thing? Newspaper, TV? How do  you keep up?  Oh Lord, that   s something that I want to share with you is that I always  read the newspaper, the Ripley paper, when it was going, and the  Cushing paper and the Stillwater paper. I never miss one of the  Stillwater papers. I read about all your library things and all and wished  I lived there so I could go to some of them, but you take this stuff. Kind  of lost the thought      How you   re keeping up with current events.  Oh, yeah. I keep up other ways now. I lost the sight in this eye. I went in  for a cataract surgery. The doctor just prodded and prodded on my eye,  and I started crying. I said,    Well, let me up. I can   t stand any more of  this.    He raised me up, and he said,    Mrs. Rainwater, I couldn   t get that  cataract, but you have lost the sight in that eye.    Here I   d been such a  person to read all this time. He went out and told my husband that I was  hemorrhaging and to get me to Dean McGee  Eye Institute  just as soon  23  Bishop  Rainwater  as he could to save the eyeball. So we went to Dean McGee, and I had to  go five different Saturdays down there to have that eye treated. Well,  then I was blind. That   s when I gave up driving a car and a lot of things  because the family thought it wasn   t the best to drive with blindness in  one eye.  It went on two years, and I was sitting one day watching television. I  watch television every minute I can, and I thought I   d saw a little  glimmer of light in that eye. I made an appointment to see Dr.  Drummond. He examined, why he said,    Mrs. Rainwater, I can operate  and put a       little deal in, this electric thing. He said,    You   ll have  perfect vision.    I said,    Well, all right.    I went in for that, and as soon as  he took that cataract off, oh, I could just see wonderful  Then all at once  there was a little black ball that just started rolling in over my sight. I  called Dr. Drummond. He said,    Oh, it   s a hemorrhage, just like the eye  did on you before.    I had to go down there, and I went in. The man that  had operated on me for this, to save the eyeball, he told me specifically  when he discharged me,    Don   t you let anybody work on that eye.  You   re blind, and you just got to accept it.    Well, here I go in, and he  recognized me. He said,    I thought I told you not to do this.    I said,    I  had a chance to get it, and I took it, and my chance wasn   t good this  time.     The doctor did save that eye, and that was back in, oh Lord, it   s been  about ten or twelve years now I   ve had good sight. Now I   ve started  losing both sights. I mean, I   ve still got this ol    cataract. I can see out of  this cataract eye almost as well as I can see out of this one. Dr.  Drummond keeps wanting me to come in and have this one operated on,  but I reason that if I do and this happens to have that blood clot on it,  well, then what if I   m blind in both eyes? I better keep some kind of a  sight, but I   m so disappointed. I got my Stillwater paper this morning,  and I can   t read, only just the big headlines. So now really that   s cut  down. Then I turn on the TV, and I have certain stations that I watch,  and I   m busy all day long doing this.  What   s a typical day like for you? What time do you get up? What do  you do?  Now, today I got up at four o   clock. I couldn   t sleep. I just woke up all  at once walleyed. In the night, (this is a funny thing to tell you) I sleep  under a big wool blanket of a thing, and I couldn   t get comfortable. I  was cold. I was just freezing. Finally I got up and looked down, and my  covers had got off to the waist. All this was just froze solid, I felt like.  (Laughter) The other waist had a three-point heat on it, and so I covered  them up, and I went back to sleep and slept until four o   clock. I woke up  just as clear as a bell. I lay there for a while, and I thought. Something  24  Bishop  Rainwater  Bishop  Rainwater  came back to mind that happened seventy years ago that I had forgotten  all about, and I went back through that whole thing and lay there. Then I  got up at five o   clock. It must have been about five thirty, and I always  take my thyroid and my Lasix at   I always insist on getting it before six  o   clock.  Then at seven I have my meal. It   s funny. I   m on that diet where you  can   t have any wheat germ. I nearly starved to death. I lost twenty  pounds on that when they first put me on that. I had diarrhea until it was  terrible. Every time I get the least bit of flour   and do you know  restaurants, some of them, put flour in their mashed potatoes? Why, by  gosh, I got the world   s wildest bunch of sores all on that, getting that  flour in the potatoes. If it just smears over where that wheat germ   s been,  I   m allergic to it to that point.  Then I get up and take my thyroid, and I have to wait an hour. Then  Lereta usually gets up, and she   ll say,    Mother, what do you want for  breakfast?    It   s a hard thing to do because there   s so few things I can  eat, but I love ol    peanut butter. I said,    Peanut butter and a banana,    and  then I have been eating figs and dates. Sometimes I have a roll, or we  found, now, these waffles, just a small waffle like that, and I   ll eat that.  It   s kind of hard to find anything to eat, but I do that. I wonder sometime  if I won   t turn into something that   s a peanut butter. (Laughter) I just eat  big spoonfuls of it.  Do you watch a lot of TV during the day or     I turn on that TV sometimes at eight o   clock, and it don   t go off until  I   m ready to go to bed.  What   s it on, usually? I assume you   re watching the news.  I do. I watch that news, boy. Do you know what? One of my girls that I  taught here in Cushing High School, she started writing a book on my  life. She got a third of it done, and she decided to turn it as if my family  were a bunch of ol    cowboys and outlaws and everything else. I said,     You   re not going to write that that way. That wasn   t a true fact on my  family.    She kind of got miffed at me and all, and she   s a widow. I told  my daughter there   s something wrong with her. There really is.  The last time I talked to her she was so radical. By golly, she   s on the  internet this morning and said that what they ought to do with those ol     fellows, those cowmen up there that run the herds out on the pastures,  the government land for three years and never paid a penny of pay for  them. She said they ought to get them because they   re threatening at  having an uprising, and Texas down here is wanting to pull away from  25  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  the government. Honestly, we   re in bad times, and people don   t realize  it. Anyhow, she put on the internet that she wanted them to come down  here on the Fourth of July to the town between California and Mexico.  Now, I   ve been over there several times, but I can   t remember its name  right now. Anyhow, she wanted them to come down there and close the  border on Mexico and us, just run us out down there. Don   t you know  when you bring those radicals down here and they carrying their guns  and the cowboy hats and all, why, Mexico is going to fight back, and  we   ll be in a war. You just watch. That   s what they   re wetting up to do.  They want to destroy this government, and people are sitting around  doing their daily things, and they   re not listening to the news.  Last night, President Obama came out and he talked about   he was  doing some executive orders, as he   s rightfully to do, to try and get some  of this stuff moving through Congress. We   re not getting anything done.  Now they   re trying to whittle off social security. They want to do away  with giving so much money to Medicare for children. Can you imagine a  poor little sick child and being refused Medicare? I can   t. There   s  something wrong with a nation that   s like that. There   s just got to be.  So you   re on the internet?  My daughter is. She has a big computer, and so she   s real good at that.  She   ll tell me little tidbits that she gets. Then my grandson brought home  an Apple BI or II or something, and gave me. He said,    Now, Mother  can show you how to use that,    and I have taught myself a great deal  about it. I sit in there, and I   ve got to where I drop it every once and a  while, but I can   t help it. It just gets away from me. (Laughs)  So what time do you go to bed?  Well, now here of late I   ve been so tired before nine thirty comes.  We   ve got some shows we especially watch at nine and things like that.  I always watch Lawrence Welk on Saturday night and Sunday night. I  don   t care if it is a rerun. Last night he really had a program. It was  someone way back in the early years. It was really good.  I worry about the condition of our country. I really do. I   ve always taken  a part in the active Democratic Party. I   ve been a delegate to the state  convention. I   ve served as officers in the Democratic Party here in  Payne County. I used to be real active and all, but now I can   t go  because I go in a wheelchair. We do have a little transportation car, and  Lereta puts me in the car out here. I go out in this wheelchair, and I can  lift myself up and get in the car. Then when we get somewhere, Lereta  has this little light  wheelchair . It   s twenty-five pounds. The  chair   doesn   t have any feet rests on it. She   ll wheel me into the restaurant, and  26  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  I   ve got a pillow in it where it   s just the right height. They can push me  up to a table, and I can sit there and eat. Peace and happiness. Then she  brings me out, and I can lift myself up and get myself in the car. Then  she comes on and puts that back in the boot, and we have it for another  round. We   ve been going to Stillwater three and four times a week to  eat.  We   ve found out they   ve got a good plate for me at the Red Lobster.  Then I go over to Chili   s, and they   ve got one good   there they have a  hamburger, but then they told about this mad cow disease. I won   t eat  anymore hamburgers over there. We used to go up the Red Lobster, and  they fired the proprietor. He was a dandy. We got acquainted to him, and  he   d come in and sit at a table with us and talk to us while we were  eating. They fired him and put in a woman. I don   t think she knows a  bean. One day Lereta and I go over there, and I said,    I don   t care how  much it costs, I   m going to have lobster tail today.    Lereta said,    I don   t  blame you, Mother.    So I ordered one. They brought it out, and when I  stuck my knife in the back to try to cut it, it was still frozen.  I called the waitress and told her that. She said,    I   ll see that you have  one.    By darn, she went back in the kitchen and left me sitting there with  that frozen lobster and brings out another one, and it   s frozen when I  tried to cut it. I said,    Lereta, let   s just go.    I called the girl and said,     We want to pay this bill.    She said,    Oh, no, you   ll have a free meal.    I  said,    I didn   t come in here to get a free meal. I came in here to get a  meal. I can   t eat a frozen lobster.    We got up and laid the money on the  desk as we went out, and we   ve never been back. It   s awful. Then like I  went to this other one, and there they were serving mashed potatoes with  flour in them. I inquired why. They said,    Flour is much cheaper than  potatoes.    You don   t know what you   re eating when you eat out.  (Laughter)  That   s true.  Well, I talked enough.  No, just one or two more. Do you have a philosophy of life?  Do I have a philosophy?  Yes.  Well, sure. I was thinking it this morning. One thing about it, I never  was happy if I had something if I wasn   t sharing it with somebody else. I  never had thought of that before, but I know when I was in college, these  poor little girls, some of them came up there and was working, and they  27  Finchum  Rainwater  Bishop  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  was nearly starving to death. I   d come home, and Mother made  mincemeat pie filling. We   d butcher and all that, and she   d have all this  fruit and everything. When I got ready to go back to school, she   d give  me, maybe, a half-a-gallon jar full of that stuff. Then she   d give me  some whipping cream, and those girls were all waiting for me when I   d  get there. Now, I could have put it in the refrigerator, and I could   ve  saved it for myself, but I wouldn   t have been happy knowing that those  other girls didn   t have anything to eat much. We   d get around the table  and sit there and laugh and eat that pie. I mean raisin and all that, from  that raisin pie, and we   d eat every darn bit of that in one night. That  philosophy that I got from my grandmother and my dad and from the  church, I   ve had an accumulation of good things taught to me up through  the ages.  Do you have any advice to someone who wants to live to a hundred?  All I say is live a good clean life. To me, that is the key to all of it, is just  to live a good clean life and do all that you can for other people.  What   s your secret to longevity?  Well, one thing, I had a good father and mother, and we evidently had  good genes, and they fed us well and saw that we had exercise. We rode  horses. I rode the bucking calves, horses, and everything like that. We  had all kind of activity, and we had good food. My dad and mother saw  to it we were all educated, all of us, and all like that. I still say you got to  have good parents. Then other people that you come in contact with   I  ran into a lady here that I took her every time she had to go. She was a  widow and much older than me, and I took her to White Shrine  whenever it met. I took her there always with me. I used to say,    Don   t  take anymore gasoline to haul five people than it does to haul one.    I  know some friends that never invite anybody to go anywhere in their  car. You   re selfish or something. I don   t understand it. So I just say  that   people, so many of them, have tried to get me to break my vows  that I made to myself, and I will not do it. I   m glad that I lived to the end  with some of my standards.  Sure. Well, what brings you joy today? What brings you joy, happiness  today?  Well, just seeing other people develop and become good citizens and  getting themselves educated. I had the counseling group up here. I got  them in one day. I was a real good friend of the state supervisor of  getting these scholarships for them if they couldn   t hear or if they  couldn   t see or walk or something. I pulled that whole senior class, 130  of them, into the auditorium, and I told them what all these were  28  Bishop  Rainwater  Finchum  available and how you could apply for scholarships like the American  Legion and all that. Out of that 130, I think it was, there were forty-five  of them applied for scholarships and got some assistance to go to school.  The girl that operated on me for my breast cancer was a daughter of a  physician that had been my physician. She did a marvelous job. I   ll tell  you, I   ve never had a bit of trouble with that. To think, here she was a  kid in high school when I knew her, and she was the nicest. She always  wanted to help people. She   s retired now. If I had anything wrong with  me, I   d want to talk her out of retirement. (Laughter)  Now, when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  Well, that I was somebody that loved to share my good fortune with  other people, and that I always tried to help people get a better education  or to help improve their life. And I have. All my life I   ve picked up kids  that everybody else said they didn   t amount to anything, yet they   re  some of the brightest and most helpful when you get through that crusty  coat of theirs. You   d find they   re just as nice as they can be, but they   ve  got to have someone that will believe in them. I think of that book on  that it takes a whole village to rear a child, and I think that   s a lot of  truth. Now, here   s an example. Over here this girl is a widow or, I don   t  know, a divorcee, and she   s got two little boys. There   s another little boy  that comes over there. Well, this girl over here that I   ve known all my  life, she saw them out there with little BBs, and she   s scared to death  that they was going to shoot out one of her windows. I never gave that a  thought. The other day those little fellows   she watches them like a  hawk, you know, that they don   t get over on her property. Yet she   s just  the best person in the world to know, but she doesn   t know how to come  deal with children.  The other day I saw them out. Their mother works. These little fellows, I  don   t know whether they   d been left over there all afternoon or what, but  they went in and got a hammock. They got out there, and there was  some big trees, and I watched them. The two big boys said to this little  boy,    You   re too short. You get out of here. You   re going to hold it  down in the middle.    He got out, and they got one thing fastened. That  wind was blowing a hurricane gale, and that little fellow, they told him  to get in there and hold that down    so we can keep it still until we get  this other one fastened.    Then a big gust of wind came and blew the  hammock and that little fellow off his feet way up in the air. He  hollered,    Let me down  Let me down     They had to take that one loose,  and they worked a long time, but they finally got it. Then the three of  them climbed up in that hammock and sat there with that wind a  whirling. You could just tell they were really in awe of that.  Well, let   s end with do you have a favorite song that comes to mind when  29  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  Finchum  Rainwater  you think about music or what you and your dad did? A song?  Oh, a song.  Yes, a song.  Well they had one that they composed about the cowboys in the band,  and they opened the music every time with that song. I can   t remember  now what it was.  Can   t sing it for us.  No.  No. All right, we   ll say thank you very much for sharing your story with  us today. It was a pleasure.  Well, thank you. I   ve enjoyed it.  -------  -------
