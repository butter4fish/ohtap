 Finchum  Today is June 5, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Oklahoma City to speak with Georgia Anderson, and this is part of our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life Project, so thank you for having us today.  Thank you.  Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  In 1914, Calera, Oklahoma. C-A-L-E-R-A, Calera. It   s a little town  south of Durant.  And what month?  May the twelfth.  So you   ve had a recent birthday.  Yes.  Well, happy birthday a little late.  Thank you.  What did your parents do for a living?  Farm. Back then, everybody farmed. Just about everybody farmed. Even  when you finished high school, you couldn   t get a job. I thought I could,  but I didn   t.  And what did they farm?  5  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Row crop.  And did you have brothers and sisters?  Five brothers and four sisters.  Big family.  Yes.  And where were you in the order?  In the middle, very middle.  Did you have chores?  Oh, yes.  What were a few of yours?  I took in the eggs in the afternoon, bring in the wood. There wasn   t no  electricity. Fill the lamps with oil, keep the house. I was the one that  kept the house going. The other ones would shun, and I would have to  pick them up. I was the one that worked and was always prepared.  Help your mother in the kitchen?  No, I worked in the field. I don   t know how to cook. (Laughter)  What about running water?  We drew the water out of the well.  Can you describe the house you grew up in?  To begin with, all ten of us children were born in a four-room house. We  were crowded. When I was in the fifth grade, my daddy could see what  was going on. I couldn   t go to school. We had to walk. I had to walk.  My first day of school, I had to walk three miles. I was a little fat  dumpling, and I couldn   t keep up. Daddy saw what was going on. It was  the beginning of the Depression. We moved from Calera to east of  Durant in a little town called Blue.  Well, there   s a river that runs across Oklahoma. It   s called the Blue  River. Empties into the Red River. We moved into a big house. Upstairs,  6  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  downstairs, two rooms upstairs, six rooms downstairs. I loved that old  house. It was just an old house. We had a big barn. A big barn. We had  granaries, chicken houses, pig pens, everything that goes with a farm.  We rented our house. We didn   t buy the house. We rented the house  from the judge of Bryan County.  When you moved into the bigger house, did he change jobs, your father?  No.  Still farming?  No, back in those days, honey, it was all farm. It   s why I   m healthy I  think. Daddy was a good farmer, and we worked. We worked, all of us.  There wasn   t a lazy one in the bunch. If we could   ve gotten paid for  what we did, we   d be millionaires today. I remember Daddy bought a     back in those days we didn   t have a Cadillac. Well, the Cadillac of my  days was a     Only thing I can think of is Model T, but that   s probably not right,  either.  No, no, no, it was driven by horses. Surrey  A surrey.  Oh, okay.  (Singing) Fringe on the top. I remember it had three seats in front, no  middle seat, and the back seat most of us could ride. I don   t think all  twelve of us ever went anywhere together because there was no room.  It would take awhile to get there, too, I guess.  Yes, but back in those days it was slow. Today it   s so fast I can   t even  keep up with the days, but back then you were relaxed. It   s a happy life.  It was hard, but it was happy. We didn   t know anything. We didn   t  know better.  What would be some things that you would do for fun?  Jump the rope, play jacks, seesaw, swing. That   s it.  What was the name of your school?  Blue High School.  What year did you graduate?  7  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Thirty-five, maybe. That   s a long time to remember.  Did you have a favorite subject?  Psychology. I loved psychology. We didn   t have typing in our little  school. When I left, my sister who graduated the next year, she learned  typing. I didn   t, and I always wanted to. I thought if I could just learn to  type I could get me a job anywhere. I could work for the President of the  United States if I wanted to. That was my goal when I went to college  was to learn to type, and I loved it. I learned it well, and I could type  well. I took shorthand and typing. When I graduated, there was nothing.  There was no jobs. Farm, that skill.  When I finished school at Murray  State College  in Tishomingo, (it was  a two-year college) I went to Southeastern  Oklahoma State University .  I decided the only thing for a girl to do then was to teach school, and  before I graduated, I got a job teaching school in a little two-room  school near Idabel, Oklahoma, a two-teacher school. I loved the old  fellow that I taught with. I loved the school. I only had thirteen students.  I had one little boy in the fourth grade, and he didn   t care anything about  reading or writing. All he wanted was his geography book. Every once  in a while I   d have time, we   d sit down with that geography book, and  he would ask questions. He wanted to know about this and that, and I  could help him.  What was the name of that school?  Pollard.  Pollard.  P-o-l-l-a-r-d, Pollard. It   s a little two-room school.  And what would the children bring for lunch?  You know, that was the beginning of handouts from the government. I  remember we would have oatmeal. I had a little burner at school, and we  would fix oatmeal for our lunch. I usually ate with them. I could   ve gone  home, the people I stayed with, and ate, but she wasn   t much of a cook,  either. She said she didn   t want to keep me there to begin with. She  looked at my red hair, and she said,    I   m not keeping schoolteachers  anymore.    I thought,    Well, I   ve looked everywhere else. I don   t have  anyplace else to stay. I either stay there, or I don   t know. I just don   t  know.    Funny, she said,    I   ll keep you one week. If you   re not too feisty  and demanding, you either stay or you don   t.     8  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  I knew I had a place to stay there because I   m not particular. I ate what  she cooked, which wasn   t much. I learned to like beans and rice. I love  it. Today I love beans and rice. I   d walk up a little sandy road about two  blocks to school. I walked every day. I hadn   t been there very long until  the little lady that got me my job to begin with, she said,    Georgia,  tomorrow       Well, I had just gotten paid. I finished a job for another  little girl. Back then if you got married, you were out. You couldn   t  teach and be married. That was the rule back then.  Or if you did you kept it quiet? If you got married you kept it a secret?  Yes, and it leaked out, and they fired her overnight. The board down  there said to this friend of mine that   we bonded when we went to  school together, and she had a school down there. There was little  scattered schools in the woods. She told the school board,    I can have  you a teacher by Monday morning.    She came to Durant where I was  enrolled in my senior year of college, and she says,    Georgia, I   m taking  you home with me. You have a school Monday morning.    I said,    No,  I   m not going. I   m going to finish here in about three or four more  months. I   ll have my degree, and I   ll look for me a school.    She says,     That   s not the way it works. There   s a hundred teachers for every  position. If you can teach these three months, finish out for this girl   .     We all knew each other down there. We all went to school at  Southeastern together, and we knew each other. She says,    Well,  tomorrow        (this was on a Saturday)       we   re having a county  teachers meeting.    I said,    I can   t go. I don   t have anything to wear.    I  had just gotten paid. The little girl that I took her place, she gave me  thirty-five dollars: a twenty, a ten, and a five, the first paper money I had  ever seen. That   s way back. She shoved the money in my hand. I had  tears in my eyes because I thought,    Well, I   ve earned that money.  That   s mine.    She says,    I   ll come by early in the morning, Saturday  morning. We   re going to Idabel.     The school was three miles from Idabel.    We   ll go in and see what we  can buy for you to wear to the teachers meeting.    We found a real nice  dress. It wasn   t cotton, real nice dress, pair of shoes, and a purse, all to  match. The lady I stayed with was going to charge me ten dollars a  month. I had enough left to pay her for the two weeks, and I was broke.  So we went to the meeting. I bought those three things for thirty-some-odd  dollars, and three dollars and a half to pay her for my rent.  Was that for a whole year   s   no, it was for three months    work?  Yes. Actually, three and a half months.  9  Finchum  Anderson  So did you finish school then?  Yes, in the summer. I didn   t get my school back that year. They told me  I could have it back. The lady that told me she might keep me on but she  might not keep me on, we fell in love with each other. I just loved that  lady. It was an older lady and a man, and next door was her daughter,  lived next door. We just loved each other. When I told her I had my  school back, she was just thrilled to death. We just loved each other, but  I had to go home at the end of school. We had to smooch and love, and I  had to go back home. I didn   t have a school, and I was disappointed.  Daddy says,    I have you an interview for next year for a school.    I said,     Oh?    He said,    It   s a little school Kenefic.    K-E-N-E-F-I-C. I   d never  heard of the place. Daddy hadn   t either. We didn   t know where it was.  Daddy says,    You go,    because he had met a fellow that was looking for  a first grade teacher. He said,    Georgia, go and look and see if you can  get the school.    Well, the fellow he talked to in Durant that afternoon  was at Market Square, where farmers hung out, Market Square in  Durant. Daddy was on the school board where I lived, and then the other  man was on the school board from Kenefic. He says,    Without knowing  or seeing your daughter, she has my vote. Have her come out, and we   ll  find the other two board members. If we all agree, you can have this  job.    It was just what I wanted. It was the first grade, first and second  grade, so I went out and found them. They signed my contract, and I  taught there the next five or six years. I love teaching. I love to teach. I  also think I can   t wait to tell somebody.  I had sisters, younger sisters and brothers at home. I was comfortable in  the school room. I loved it. I just loved it. When I went to school,  probably when you went to school, you learned to read by phonics. You  can   t read any other way. Someone in Washington changed it. You don   t  learn to read by phonics anymore. It   s from Washington. The kids, you  learn to read by sight. Mother made a picture, and you remember the  picture. That   s no way to teach school, to teach reading. No way, I  couldn   t teach. I just couldn   t. My kids were not learning to read. You  just can   t teach that way. When I went to school, you learned your ABCs  and what they sounded like. They have a sound. I talked to my principal.  I said,    My kids are not learning to read. I   m not doing my job because  when Johnny comes home and he   s not reading, they blame me, which is  true.    I said,    I   m going to have to change jobs.  I came to Oklahoma City where my sister was working at Tinker Field,  and she says,    Why don   t you stay up here? Don   t go back and try to  teach school anymore. You   re disappointed.    I was, because I loved  teaching and I worked with those little kids. We had fun. We had fun. I  10  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  applied at Tinker Field, and with my teaching background they hired me  as an instructor. I thought,    I   ll take the job because they know how to  read.    They were older people, older than me. I took the job. I had free  range of the field. I could jump in a little cart and go anywhere I wanted  to over the field and learn this and that, so people coming in for the first  time for an interview, I could give them a good interview, and I did. I  loved it. I loved that job, but it didn   t last very long. They discontinued  the school. I guess I was there about a year and a half, and they  discontinued the school. I guess they decided they didn   t need it. They  discontinued altogether. None of us. All of us had to go find a   and  bosses. His name was Graves. He says,    Georgia, you know the field  pretty good.    He says,    We   re not firing you, but where do you think  you   d like to work?    I thought,    Supply.    I chose supply to work. I loved  it. I loved it. I remember the morning I walked into supply, where I was  going to work, where I wanted to work. I walked down that long hall to  the front desk where a Captain Carter was the boss. He said,    Oh, you   re  hired,    because I said,    My name is Carter.       You   re hired.    (Laughs)  As I walked in the side door, I saw a lady that was the loveliest lady I   d  ever seen. I said, to myself,    I want to work for her.    He brought me all  the way back down the hall. It wasn   t a hall; it was a aisle, down the  aisle. I worked for her. Sweetest lady I think I ever knew, and her name  was Georgia, Georgia Smith. (Laughs) I loved her. I just loved her. We  kind of bonded. I don   t know. We just   that   s when I learned looks is  skin deep. It   s inside you look for and not the outside. Throughout my  life from then on, it was the inside not the outside that counts because  she was   .  Was that in the   40s or   50s when you were there?  Early   30s     Thirties. Okay.     when I worked at Tinker Field. I had two runs at Tinker Field because  I married, and I was out for nine  years . I got married and got pregnant.  Back then, if you got pregnant you didn   t work. I worked five months  and when I begin to     Show?     I quit. I checked out. They said,    Well, why don   t you take a leave of  absence and come back?    My husband said,    No, you check out,     because he was making good money and could afford the family. I was  out nine years. My little boy, he was a little Down   s Syndrome boy, a  different turn in my life. All of a sudden, (this is not a nice story) all of a  11  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  sudden Clyde got fired. Clyde is my husband. He got fired for a selfish  reason, nothing he did wrong, not a thing. His immediate boss in the  city, they couldn   t figure it out, and the big boss, their big boss in  Houston   he had a big boss in Texas, Dallas, Texas. He came out and  gave Clyde this pink slip. No reason. Give it to him on Friday, pay, and  he was out. He came home one day at lunchtime, and I said,    Clyde,  why are you home?    He usually came home at five, and he was home  during lunch. He says,    Georgia, I got fired. I got fired.    Well, that hit  me in the stomach. From that day until this one I   ve had stomach  trouble. (Laughs) That just hit me in the stomach. He doesn   t have a job.  He knew I was qualified to work and knew I could work.  We put our little boy in Enid school with the little boys with the same  disability. He loved it. It wasn   t a bad thing. It was a good thing that  happened. I knew I had to go back to work, so I applied at this Capitol. I  thought,    What I   ll do      I knew I wouldn   t have to work, make the  living. That   s his job. I applied at the Capitol. The job I was going to do,  I was going to learn how to do taxes. That   s just once a year. I thought,     Boy, in six months, I won   t be working.    They was going to hire me.  Then I went down to John A. Brown. They were going to hire me in the  office to do, I don   t know, some kind of paper work. Then I had been  doing substitute teaching all along where we lived. It wasn   t Warr Acres,  but we were in the neighborhood. I can   t remember the school where I  did substitute teaching. I didn   t like it. Thought I   d teach the fourth  grade, and I didn   t like it, the fourth grade. I had three jobs promised me,  and I said,    Clyde, I don   t know which one to take.    He said,    Well,  honey, if you   re going to work away from home for eight hours a day,  work where you make the most money. You used to work at Tinker  Field. You should go out there and apply for the second time.     I did. I didn   t put on airs. I just went,    I want to be reinstated.    That   s all  I put, and I went to work immediately. I was doing timekeeping to begin  with. I didn   t like it because you   re responsible for somebody else   s  check. I thought,    Boy, if I flub up, out of here.    I was   promoted into  timekeeping, I guess. This is the name of it. One of the guys, I was going  to take his place. He had had a surgery. I think it was too much calcium  around his heart. He was going to have to quit. See, he says,    Georgia, I  want you to take my place. It would be a promotion for you.    He was  showing me how to do his work.  And how long did you stay at Tinker that time?  All in all, I worked twenty-one years. Twenty-three. Twenty-three.  Were you there when World War II was over?  12  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Yes. I came to the city in    41, when the beginning of the war   .  Do you remember much about those days? What would you do for fun in  those days?  Dance.  Dance?  Seven nights a week.  Wow.  I love to dance. When I came to the city, it was full of servicemen, and  they were coming into town to visit, have fun, to break up the monotony  of the day, I guess. I was staying with my sister. I moved in with my  sister and her roommate. That made three of us in the room. There was  only one bed, so I got the couch. I slept on the couch just fine. It was just  fine. They were going to go down to the corner that night, after I   d been  there about a week, and drink and meet the boys. They were going in to  drink beer, talk, laugh, have fun. I said,    I   m not going. I don   t want to  go. I don   t drink beer, and I   m not going.    Well, they begged me to go,  and I had to go. It was just because I loved my sister. I thought,    What  she can do, I can do.     I went down to the corner with them. We just walked down the street to  the corner. There was just a bunch of guys in there talking and drinking  beer. That   s all. They offered their beer. I said,    I   ll take a Coke.    The  waiter said,    We don   t serve Cokes.    One of the guys says,    Give her a  beer.    I tasted it for my first time. I didn   t like it. Soon after that, they  were going to go dancing at the Skirvin Tower Hotel. I   d never danced.  I   d never really danced, and I said,    Well, I   m not going. I don   t know  how to dance.    My sister said,    Yes, you   re going with us. If you   re  going to be staying here in the city with us, you   re going to learn a  different life.     We got ready, and we went. I thought,    If they insist, I   ll go. I can get  me a table, and I   ll sit over in the corner. I   ll drink me a Coke, and I   ll  watch Stanley Kenton and his band.    The Skirvin Tower, third floor, I  never will forget that place. A little sailor came over. All four of us  walked in, me and my sister and the two girls. They were sisters. They  were Assyrians, and they were beautiful girls, popular girls. The boys  came over, and they danced. One asked me, and I said,    I don   t know  how to dance. Thank you, I   ll just sit here.    My sister pushed me. She  told the little boy,    She can dance     She pushed me, and he caught me.  13  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  We pretended to dance all afternoon. He wouldn   t let me sit down. He  said,    You have good rhythm, and I know you can learn. I   ll teach you.     I enjoyed the evening. From then on, it was a different life. I went  dancing seven nights a week. We had to go to work at six fifteen in the  morning. I was always on time. All my life, all the jobs I   ve ever had,  I   ve never been late, never been a minute late.  Was it ballroom type dancing?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Well, they had jitterbug, too, but I usually sat them  out. I could do the steps, but I didn   t like it. I loved the slow, evening  gown, high heels, slow dance. I met a fellow from Chicago. He was a  staff sergeant. His profession was he had a dance studio. He was  teaching dancing, and he said,    Of everybody I ever danced with, you  have rhythm, and I   d like to teach you.    He was a teacher. He was a  teacher. I loved to dance, and I danced with him. I learned to tango, to  jitterbug, to rhumba, all of them. I loved to dance.  Did you get to continue that when you got married?  No, I buried it. You want to know about how I got married?  Sure.  Well, when I left high school, I could   ve married the little boy I was  going with. My daddy said to me,    Georgia, if you   re going to marry  this boy you   ve been going with, and I think you are, you   re going to  crawl through the fence.    We had a cotton patch. He says,    You   re  going to crawl through the fence, and you   ll pick cotton in his field. If  that   s what you want to do the rest of your life, I have cotton here for  you to pick. You don   t have to marry.    He was just a high school boy,  and I knew that. He wanted me to marry. I said,    Not now. Someday but  not now.    We didn   t have any place, no money, no apartment, no place  to live. I wasn   t going to live with my people, and I wasn   t going to live  with his people. That   s what my sister did, but not me.  Then I started my education. I got a job. I was making money. He  thought for sure we would get married then.    Not now,    I told him,    but  one day I will, but not now.    I was working at Tinker Field at the time.  My shipping clerk out in the warehouse said,    Georgia, I have a buddy  overseas. If he writes to you, will you write to him?    I said,    Yes.    He  wrote. I answered. We did this for about a year and a half. I didn   t have  anything to say. He didn   t have anything to say. I signed my name with  shorthand. He wrote back in Spanish. I couldn   t read his, and he couldn   t  read mine. We talked about that later. When he was discharged and got  home, he called me up. We made a date for Saturday night with his  14  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  buddy that introduced us to begin with.  I had never met Clyde. We had just been writing to each other. He  hesitated to come up the stairs to get me that night. I said,    Well, why,  Clyde?    Later I asked that. He said,    I didn   t know what to say to a  schoolteacher.    (Laughs) The four of us went dancing out north at a big  dance hall to the Guy Lombardo band. He was a good dancer, fair. He  sang in my ears. The most beautiful sound I had ever heard in my life.  He had a good voice. When he left me that night, I thought,    We had a  good time.    He was a man. He wasn   t a boy. He was a man, I thought.  He told me goodbye. He left. I said to myself,    That man would make  somebody a good husband. I wish it could be me,    never dreaming it  would ever be me, never, never.  The next Saturday night, he says,    Will you marry me?    My mind froze.  I couldn   t say anything. I thought,    This is what I want. Why can   t I say  yes?    I couldn   t say yes. He says,    Is there someone else?    I was  standing there looking at him. He says,    Is there somebody else?    I put  both fingers behind me like this, and I said,    No.    Finally, I said,     Clyde, I don   t know you. You don   t know me. Could you wait awhile?     He says,    Yes. I   ll give you a week.    When we met again, the answer  was yes, real quick. (Laughs) I said it again real quick. He says   and  this is why I thought he was a man rather than a boy. He says,    Now,  Georgia, we can   t get married right now. I am not established in a good  job.    I thought,    Well, that   s smart.    I didn   t want to get married then,  anyway.  We kept seeing each other occasionally. When he came home in time to  have Thanksgiving dinner with his mom and dad, that was in November.  The next September, we were married. I said,    When I get off a day of  work, Labor Day, I have a day off. We   ll get married then.    It was fine  with him and fine with me. He proved to be one of the smartest men I     when he joined the service, he was in his second year of college. He was  doing a law and a history major. She says,    Why do you want to quit  school and join the service?    He says,    I don   t want to be in the Army. I  don   t want to dig a ditch and be dirty. I want the water. I want to be on  the water. If I join, I can pick what I want. If they draft me, and they  will       because he was at the right age. He chose to be a Seabee. He  chose to be a Seabee. He was there four years. He had a good life.  What year did you get married?  I was twenty-nine, and he was thirty. I don   t know the year.  In the early   40s? And you were married for how many before     15  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Thirty-seven. He died of a sudden heart attack and diabetes. He died  when he was sixty-two or sixty-one.  Long time.  Your turn. (Laughter)  At any point, did you realize or think you would live to be a hundred?  Oh no, no, no, no, no. (Laughs) No, but my family all died young. Mama  died at sixty-one. I think Daddy lived to be eighty-two. Even my aunts  and uncles, they all died young. I don   t have anyone left, except nieces  and great-nieces.  Well, how did you celebrate when you turned one hundred? What did  you do to celebrate?  Oh, they had a lovely party here for me. This is a lovely place to live, a  lovely, lovely place to live.  How long have you been here?  I   ll be here eleven years on October 16.  Well, when you reached ninety-nine, did you think,    One more year. I   m  going to do it   ?  Yes, I guess so. I think I   ll be here next year. My health has been fair to  good.  What would you think your secret is to longevity then? Do you have an  opinion on that?  Oh, do all you can as long as you can. I mean, a busy life is a happy life,  a good life. Remember, I   m not lazy. I still do my own laundry. I   m a  hundred. They say,    Well, Georgia, you get around just real well,    but  it   s hard. It   s hard for me now to get around.  Is that the biggest challenge to being one hundred?  Yes. You slow down. You fade out. You just fade out. It   s hard. It   s  really hard. I don   t want to be a hundred and one, but I don   t have a  choice.  Did you give up driving when you moved in here?  16  Anderson  Bishop  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Bishop  Anderson  Bishop  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Yes, Charles Johnson brought me in here, and he said,    You don   t need  a car. We have a limo to take you anywhere you want to go, anytime you  want to go.    I sold my car. Practically gave it away to my step-grandson.  You said that you don   t want to live to be a hundred and one and that  you fade out. Is there anything good about being a hundred?  No, sir. No, sir.  Playing bingo and winning?  I love my life. I love right now. Tomorrow I don   t know. We don   t know  what tomorrow brings.  Sure. What   s a typical day for you? When do you wake up? What do you  do? When do you go to bed? What   s a typical day for you at a hundred?  What   s it like?  Well, we have an itinerary to go by. They give us a little weekly   it  gives you your meals for the week and what you   re going to do that  week and if there   s any games to play. I love games, any kind. This  afternoon at one o   clock we   re going to play Bunko with dice. You  throw it. You ever play it?  Yes.  Nothing to it. Nothing to it. The games they play here, there   s nothing to  it. When I first came here, Charles says,    Now this lady here   will  guide you if you need anything, want to know where things are.    I didn   t  ask, and she didn   t guide me. I ventured out to the dining room and  back. Next day, I went to the laundry and a little bit more and went back.  I found my way around. No one ever told me anything. The first  morning I was here, I was behind the ladies, and I heard them say they  were going to play Chicken Foot. I said,    I know how to play Chicken  Foot.    I followed them. They came down here to the activity center, and  we all played Chicken Foot.  What   s Chicken Foot?  You play it with dominoes. There   s nothing to it, honey. If there   s a five  out there and you have a five, you play a five against a five.  That   s Chicken Foot.  Nothing to it. Nothing to it. Then we branched out. There was eight of us  around the table, and I said,    Now, that   s too many.    A little guy came  17  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Bishop  Anderson  Bishop  Anderson  in late, and he says,    Now I   m going to play.    I said,    Harold you don   t  have room. There   s not room for you.    He says,    But I   m going to play.     He scooted up behind me, and he got his dominoes, and he played.  That   s too many. The next morning, I brought my Skip-Bo cards down. I  thought,    I   m going to see if he   ll play,    and another lady that I like very  well. I said,    Why don   t the three of us come in here, and I   ll show you  how to play Skip-Bo.    Nothing to it. Nothing at all to it. They didn   t  want to go. I said,    If you can count from one to thirteen, you can play.     They could count to thirteen, so we all came in here, and I showed them  how to play.  Well, I was the one that started Skip-Bo. They liked it, and pretty soon  everybody was playing Skip-Bo instead of Chicken Foot. They were  playing Skip-Bo. Then one night we graduated to Back Alley Bridge.  (Laughter) Back Alley Bridge, it   s a good game. It   s a thought game.  Then we played Rummikub. Now, if you want to use your mind, it   s a  think game. You have to watch the board. You have to remember. It   s a  good exercise for your mind, the best, one of the best. We play that once  in a while. They don   t want to play it because you better be alert,  attentive, watch the board.  And what was the name of it?  Rummikub. I love it. I love it whether I win or not. I like to play games  whether I win or not. I play to win. I   m not going to give the game away,  but if I don   t win, I don   t win.  That   s from growing up with a family of ten brothers and sisters?  Well, my little boy, his motto in school was,    Let me win, but if I can   t  win, let me be brave in trying.    That   s what he learned from his school.  He was a little Down   s Syndrome boy, but he progressed. Some of them  children excel. He was a precious little boy. He could dance. You  remember the Twist?  Yes.  The fellow that taught him said,    I   d put him up against anybody. He did  it better than anybody I   ve ever seen.     Now, did he live at home with you?  No, we put him in Enid when we found out he was disturbed. We had  joined a club with boys like my little boy, and they kept saying,    You  need to put him in a school somewhere with kids his IQ.    The lady with  the children said her boy was at Enid. Said,    He   s doing fine.    When we  18  Bishop  Anderson  Bishop  Anderson  Finchum  Bishop  put him up there, we didn   t see him. We came home and cried. They  said,    You can   t see him for six weeks. He has to adjust.    We  understood. I did. In six weeks, we went back to pick him up. Oh, he  was happy as he could be. He didn   t care if he saw us or not. He didn   t  want to come home. He was having fun. In school, he learned to tie his  shoes, button his shirt, use his table manners. He knew where his clothes  were. He could dress himself. He progressed fine. We were happy. We  were happy. He was happy. You know what the unique thing is? He died  at sixty-two like his daddy, and it was the same problem: a sudden heart  attack. He was a precious little boy.  So do you have a philosophy you live by in life, a motto?  Do all you can for as long as you can. I think positive. I think what you  think is who you are. As a man thinketh, so is he. I   m not lazy, and I like  to be busy. I learned that from my little kids at school. I taught the first  graders. If I   d just keep them busy, the room was happy. I know it   s  different today. It   s different today. I wouldn   t teach school now under  no circumstances. I think that teaching them by sight only lasted about     as long as I was in school, it was that way. That   s why I had to quit. I  wasn   t worthy. I wasn   t producing what I should have been. Just taking  money under false pretense. Not exactly, but...  Well, what do you think is the secret to your longevity? What   s  contributed to your long life?  Having lived on a farm. We had everything under the sun to eat, good,  healthy food. I   m eating the same food today, but it isn   t as healthy  because it   s been fertilized and the fertilizer is not good for you, not  good for the plants. We just dug a hole, planted the food, planted the  vegetables, and it rained enough to make the garden. We didn   t have to  water. Today you water, but then you didn   t. It was just different. The  whole world was different. It rained. It made our crops. I have step-family  in Purcell now. They have over a thousand acres. They   re on a  ranch. I   ve been over to the ranch because the granddaughter took me  one day over to the ranch. I didn   t know about ranching, but it   s  interesting, very interesting. If it don   t rain   see, we   re in drought now.  If it don   t rain, they don   t have green grass for the cows. They can   t bale  it. They bale the hay. They fertilize some of the grass, and if it don   t  rain, then they don   t have any grass. Back in my days, it rained. The  whole world was different.  It was.  Yes.  19  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Bishop  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  And you canned your own food and cooked and     Yes. In the wintertime we had plenty of beef. We had cattle. Daddy  would, as he says, fatten up the calf. We   re going to butcher it at a  certain time. There wasn   t electricity. We had to either eat it or can it.  We rented a big canner from the county. It was owned by the county to  be loaned out if anybody needed it. We brought it home, Mama canned,  and we had all the beef we could eat for about two or three weeks. That  was as long as it would last because it was in the wintertime and it was  cold. It would keep awhile, and she would can the short ribs and the  different parts. In the summertime when we ran out of beef or pork, we  could make stew out of the canned meat, mix it with the vegetables. We  had stew because we had every   we had a little patch of popcorn that  we kept. Things have been grown differently. Then, we just planted it,  no fertilizer, no water. We just chopped the weeds away to keep the  weeds from taking the water. Most of it was in the ground, so things  grew. They don   t today. You have to water them. You see sprinklers.  You had popcorn?  Oh, yes. We had popcorn, peanuts. We had everything. We made our  own syrup. It was some of the best syrup you ever ate.  Pecans? Those grow pretty well down in that area.  Yes, sir. Behind the barn there was two big pecan trees, so Mama had all  the nuts she wanted to cook with, pecans.  Rented canners from the county. Was home demonstration, county  agents, and     Yes, yes.  Was your mother a member of a homemaker club?  No.  Didn   t have time?  No, baby. She was always having babies. I can never remember my  mama not being pregnant. (Laughs). Well, every other year.  Did she have time to sew?  Yes, when we were little. She made my dresses and my bloomers to  match. I was always buying three yards of material that would make me  20  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Anderson  Bishop  Anderson  a dress and my bloomers to match (Laughs).  That was in Idabel or Blue?  No, not in Idabel because when I was in the seventh and eighth grade, I  decided I wouldn   t wear Mama   s homemade dresses anymore. If Daddy  couldn   t buy me one, I would just not   I don   t know. I didn   t want her  making me dresses and bloomers to match. I was growing up.  And didn   t wear pants too often, I bet.  Oh no, no, not even when I worked at Tinker Field. They didn   t wear  pants. No, I had to dress up, comb my hair. You had to primp, yes.  And nylons. Well, is there anything left on your bucket list that you  would like to do?  No.  No?  I wouldn   t mind going to school again. You know what? If they had a  school here, if I could go   I can   t get out. I can   t stand up. I can   t  balance, and during recess I   ll fall. I   d like to take a course in science of  the mind.  Interesting.  Get as much out of it as I could, for as long as I live.  Well, how early do you get up these days?  I don   t have a sleep pattern. I don   t go to bed and sleep eight hours a  night and wake up at a certain hour. I don   t go to bed at a certain hour. I  don   t get up at a certain hour. It   s just, here you can do as you please.  Nothing I have to get up for. When I first came here, I was eighty-nine,  and I could run up and down the halls. I didn   t have this. I had a cane,  but I was not on this.  I want to know, when history is written, what do you want it to say about  you?  She had a normal life or above, a teeny bit above normal. A normal life  is being yourself. I   ve never tried to be like somebody else. If you do,  you   re going to mess up. You sure will. You sure will. If somebody has  something I don   t, that   s his. It   s not mine. I   m not jealous.  21  Finchum  Anderson  Finchum  Well, we   ll stop now, and I   ll thank you very much for talking with us  today.  Thank you, honey.  It   s been fun.  -------  -------
