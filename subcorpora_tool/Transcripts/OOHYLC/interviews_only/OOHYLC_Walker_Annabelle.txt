 Finchum  Today is August 7, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in  Grove, Oklahoma to speak with Annabelle    Annie    Walker and this is  part of our  Oklahoma  100 Year Life project. Thank you for having us  today.  Thank you for coming. I wasn   t expecting an interview or anything. I  was just, as I said, you know, here I wasn   t planning for any kind of  interview or anything. Whatever comes along, well I will.  Well, when were you born?  Well, all the history and things with the family    I was born on August  the third, 1914. And I   m a hundred years old now. (Laughs)  Congratulations.  Well, thank you. Not very many people reach that age, I don   t think,  anymore.  They don   t.  There   s more now than usual, I   d imagine.  Where were you born?  About five    No, I was born in Jay, Jay, Oklahoma. My father had some  kind of a business there.  Okay.  5  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Kind of a feed store or something like that. I don   t remember just what it  was, but they lived in Jay, Oklahoma. That   s where I was born,  Delaware County.  In town or on a farm?  In town.  In town. Did you have brothers and sisters?  I had one brother and four sisters.  And were you the baby or the oldest or     No, I was the third one.  The third one.  They always said the third one was the hardest to manage, but I think I  was one of the better ones. (Laughter) I had one sister that was younger  than me and she was full of life and never got settled down or upset. She  always   she was on the bright side, you might say. Just everything was  funny to her and stuff like that.  What were your parents    names?  My parents? My father   s name was Samuel, everybody called him Sam.  I had one great-nephew named after him, Sam Nelson. He lives in Tulsa  (Oklahoma) and he has a business of his own, some kind welding shop  or something. I don   t know, but    We had our anniversary last Sunday.  Were you there? I was about to say, we didn   t send out invitations. We   d  just tell anybody that knew me they could come.  I was noticing on your family tree that your great-grandparents came on  the Trail of Tears?  Mm-hmm.  Did you know them?  I knew my grandparents. I didn   t know my great-grandparents. They  were already gone when I was born. We lived out, as I said, by Butler   s  community out there. And that was my mother   s side of the family. My  husband, I married, he was raised out north of town and part of the old  home, we lived in for a while, where he was born, after we married. And  then we came to town. He did a lot of carpenter work. He was a  6  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  carpenter.  Your husband?  Uh-huh. We built our own home here.  When did you get married?  Oh, I got to think about that?  How old were you when you got married?  I was twenty, twenty-one. My husband was twenty-five.  So in the mid    30s then. Did your mother work?  Yes, she had to because we lost my father when I was about twelve, see.  So then of course, I went to live with her brother, my uncle. And then  he   s the one that put me in the school where I was, you know. I went to  Sequoyah in Tahlequah (Oklahoma). I went all my four years there and  then I went to Haskell Junior College in Lawrence, Kansas after I  graduated.  What was your major?  Business, more or less.  Business.  Mm-hmm.  And when did you graduate from there? Do you remember?  I didn   t graduate.  From Haskell?  Yeah, I felt like I had enough to kind of go on and I could improve on  that or do something, so I came home then from college and worked  around at various businesses. Wound up at a Chevrolet agency there and  worked for several years there for my boss. And they were from  Maysville  Oklahoma , he and his wife. He was young and so was I, but  he was a good business manager and he had the Chevrolet business for  years there. He had Plymouth and Ford Motors besides. There were  three and then some used car dealers that surrounded Grove.  7  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Cars were a little bit different then, weren   t they?  Beg your pardon.  Cars were a little bit different then.  Oh yes.  Did you work while you were married?  That was most of the time after I married I spent there, because we  moved into town when Betty was starting to school. We lived way out in  the country about ten miles, and I didn   t want put her on the bus so I  moved into town until weekends. And then on weekends we   d go back  out to the farm, back and forth, until we finally built our own home.   First  we bought a house and added on some rooms to it and the house  sits down there   are you familiar with Grove?  No.  Well you go up to Seventh Street and you go straight towards the  schoolhouse and you   ll come to a   on Seventh Street, I guess it is, right  below that, down in that kind of valley. They sold the house. Juarez  bought our land there and we had lived there about seven or eight years  or longer. And we moved from there to here, we built this one up here.  So, I   ve lived here the rest of the time and still here and I said, well, I  didn   t know what else I   d do unless I went to the nursing home. And he  said,    No, you don   t want to do that   , so.  And this is home.  Uh-huh. No, it   d be different, I   m sure. And my husband worked part-time  and then he had the farm out there. It was the old home place. We  bought that and lived out there for a number of years.  What did you farm?  Cattle, mostly. It was a ranch. He didn   t do much farming. He just had a  lot of cattle and stuff like that they raised. Then him and his brother were  carpenters and they both worked here for the Wilson Lumber Company.  He kept them busy all the time with building, homes and buildings and  different things here. So that   s why we moved into town, because we  couldn   t take care of both deals.  Sure. Well, when you were little, what did you do for fun?  8  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Well, I didn   t have a lot of time for fun. I went to church and whatever  they did there well, I usually helped with it or done something, maybe  furnish refreshments. Same way when I was in school. While Betty was  in school, I was homeroom mother and I was busy. I mean I didn   t ever  have any spare time, we might say, just on weekends and my family was  coming to visit us sometimes on weekends. I had all these brothers and  sisters, one brother and all these sisters, so.  Well, when you were just newly married were you involved with a  homemaker club?  No, I wasn   t involved in any club, but I worked at church there and I  taught in the junior department, boys and girls and all that with that kind  of work. And then after I retired is when I organized this little Indian  ladies club. I thought,    I   ve got time on my hands here now and I don   t  know what to do, so I   m going to do something for entertainment.    So I  called a bunch of ladies and asked if they   d be interested in forming a  club and they said,    Oh yes, we need something to do.    So I organized a  club and made their bookwork and all that kind of stuff. We studied  about the Indian customs you know, our families and traditions and  different things like that. So and it   s still alive and going today. I  managed twenty-seven members and I think there   s about that many yet.  That   s pretty good.  Uh-huh. And we met once a month and we paid a dollar for dues for it.  Then also whenever your birthday came along, we had our birthday  offering, so that was our financial. And we did scholarships for kids for  high school. We gave two scholarships, boys and girls, five hundred  dollars each.  That   s good.  So, I feel like I   ve accomplished a little bit.  What was the name of the club?  Tsa-la-gi which means Cherokee ladies.  Tsa-la-gi?  Uh-huh and we would fix Christmas baskets and donate them to the city  for helping the needy. So that was part of our projects those days we  had, so. We called ourselves    Tsa-la-gi    which means Indian ladies and  it   s still working today. And we have several members and we help with  whatever money we have to spare, you know. And we give these two  9  Bishop  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  five-hundred dollar scholarships, which wasn   t very much but it was lot  then.  How do you spell that?  Tsa   And that is pronounced    Tsa-la-gi    and that   s the Indian word for  Indian ladies,    Tsa-la-gi   . And I said I never did learn to speak  Cherokee, but I learned a lot of words from my father. He used to be a  representative for the Cherokee Indians among Delaware County. Made  several trips to Washington, D.C. and taking care of business for the  tribe. It   s called Tsa-la-gi Club and that   s the Indian ladies. T-S-A-L-A-G-  I. Tsa-la-gi.  Okay.  And I don   t speak Cherokee, but my dad did. That   s why he was on the  business committees and everything of the Cherokee tribe.  And he passed away when you were twelve?  Uh-huh.  From what?  Well it was just when the flu was real bad. He got it in the fall and he  never could just get over it, he had it and he finally passed away in  March. But he was sick there off and on and he   d go here and there and  do things. He was an interpreter for the tribe. So, I guess a little bit of it  rubbed off on me or something. (Laughs) Anyway, I had about twenty-five  members or something like that come every month and they were  all so anxious to come. I told them, I said,    I was needing something,  some kind of outlet,    you know. Instead of just sort of working and  doing nothing and I taught the twelve-year-old girls in Sunday school  class. I   ve been busy all my life you might say, until I kind of retired and  I   m not doing nothing now. I feel like I   ve done my deal, whatever I   ve  accomplished, you know.  You said you went to Haskell Community College in Lawrence.  Lawrence, Kansas.  Can you tell us a little about those days?  And I took night classes. They had night school here for some time, for  some kind of projects and I took those night classes, business stuff and  things like that. I always took advantage of stuff then, and I felt like it  10  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Belkam  Walker  Belkam  Finchum  Bishop  Walker  could help me a little bit. And I worked for various businesses here in  Grove and finally went to work for a Chevrolet agency, secretarial  bookkeeper.  Well, while you were at Haskell, did you live in a dorm?  Was I what?  Did you live in a dorm when you were at Haskell?  Yes. I went there in the fall and didn   t come home until school was out. I  didn   t have the resources to run back and forth, and my father passed  away in the meantime see. So I just did whatever, you know, there in my  childhood days, whatever, but I was busy. As I said, every little bit  helped.  Did you sew much?  What?  Did you sew much? Sew?  I could, but I didn   t. (Laughter) I made a lot of her (daughter   s) clothes  and stuff like that just for ourselves, but I didn   t sew for everybody else.  I didn   t have time.  Well, do you have any stories from the Depression?  Not really, no.  What about the dust storms you told me about?  Huh?  What about the dust storms you told me about?  Dust storms.  Do you remember the Dust Bowl and the dust storms?  That was when I was at Haskell Junior College up there and the dust  storms were terrible back in the    30s. See I graduated in    34 and went  there in    35 and    36 and there would be so much dust you could hardly  see. We had to string up little ropes and things in our dorm and hang up  wet towels and next morning they   d be so black, you couldn   t tell what  they were. The dust was that thick. It   d just choke you, if you got out in  11  Bishop  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Belkam  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  the open air. So we had to stay in mostly, you know after our school  hours and things like that. I worked during my term there at the school  and weekends for teachers and different people in the school system. I  worked there to help buy my clothing and stuff that I needed, so.  What was the Great Depression like for you?  Well, you couldn   t buy nothing because you didn   t have the money to do  it with and just whatever you had, you had to be happy, you know. I had  an older sister and she didn   t care about school, didn   t care for school.  So she worked and she would send me a little money every once in a  while, besides when I worked for employees and different things at the  school, you know. We didn   t get paid to do our, there at the school, we  stayed boarded there because we got our room and board, you see.  That   s been most of my life, kind of on a merry-go-round, you might  say.  How did you get to Haskell? How did you travel to Haskell?  Well, we stayed in the dorm and we   d just go from there.  Well, did you go by train or by bus?  I   d go by train when I went from home to school. I   d ride the train to  Kansas City and get off there and take a train into Lawrence, Kansas  where the school was and then they picked us up in a big taxi car that the  school had. So I never knew where I was going to land or what was  going to happen. (Laughter)  You ought to ask her how she got to Sequoyah.  But I said my father is gone and my mother had a time trying to    And  her brother kind of took us under his wing, you know, and helped her  and the kids that were home, the little ones, younger ones. I had one  younger sister that was   went to school at Grove and she graduated  from Grove, so.  Well, how did you get to Sequoyah?  Beg pardon?  How did you get to Sequoyah?  We went there. I had an uncle that lived in Tahlequah. And we would,  maybe they   d let you come home for about a month during the  summertime and she would come and get us. She   d have to send  12  Bishop  Walker  Belkam  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  someone to pick us up, my sister and I, and we   d come home and stay  about a month and then go back to school when school started. So, but  we never did leave there unless we rode the bus there, and they had the  bus that   d take kids.  We had a place there about a mile out in the country and it   d be a really  kind of nice spring there. And we   d have picnics and do things like that,  the different classes of girls or boys or whichever. And we called it  Coffee Hollow. We   d go out there and make coffee. We couldn   t have  coffee in the dorms. We   d just take some old buckets and things and  make a pot of coffee down there, down in Coffee Hollow. We called it  Coffee Hollow. (Laughs)  What happened if you did get caught with coffee?  Well, they knew we had coffee. But we didn   t have it at school, we had  some kind of imitation, I don   t know. But we   d all put our money  together and get our food and stuff that we   d take down to Coffee  Hollow and have our picnic, annual picnic or something. (Laughter) I   ve  had quite a life as you   re hearing, meandering here and there and then  work during the summertime.  I think she worked in the infirmary at school, you might ask her about  that.  I worked for the big Kress    store when they first put one in here. And we  had a nice caf   there on the corner called White Way. On weekends and  when the store was closed, I   d work at the caf   there and waitress.  Always working. You were always working.  Uh-huh, always something. I had to because that was the only resources  I had, see, it was what I made. Of course I got my room and board there  at the school, you know. We had nice dorms and places like that.  Did you work in the infirmary?  Some at the hospital. We had a little hospital area and we   d go there and  work of the morning before I went to school. We   d get up at seven  o   clock and we   d go to wherever we worked, if we worked. And I   d go  to the hospital and if any of the kids were sick and had colds or  whatever, well, we could give them   the nurses set out the medicine and  we   d give, each one that were supposed to have their medication, we   d  help give that to the kids coming to the hospital. So, I did that and I   ve  done a little bit of everything. (Laughs)  13  Bishop  Walker  Belkam  Bishop  Walker  Finchum  Walker  My mother   s brother, his name was Walter Fox. He worked for the  Indian Agency out of Muskogee (Oklahoma) and he kind of took me  under his wing and sort of put me down there in this school, see there at  his hometown. I   d go out to his house on weekends sometimes, you  know, and spend the weekend. I haven   t had a bed of roses, you might  say. I just kind of on my own, steel bone life and everything.  Well, how did you meet your husband?  Well, I had known him for a long time. We growed up here together. We  used to gang up, kids did, when everyone was in high school and we   d  get together, all of us. So, then when I finished high school, I came back  to Grove and went to work at a little   we had a store by the name of  Allen   s, Allen Dry Goods, there on the corner where those buildings are.  And had a dress shop in there and there were days that I worked in this  dress shop, places like that. When I started school, in the summertime  and then later on when I went to work there at the college hospital     well, I stayed there at the hospital and worked there as a, you know,  helper, helping give the kids    that place was kind of more or less for  children who didn   t have a home. They   d go home in the summertime,  some of them, but we would stay there all summer and winter. Didn   t  get to go home, but maybe a weekend or something like that.  Ask her about her first date with him.  So you knew your husband for a while, what was your first date?  Well, we didn   t really date, we   d just all gang up and some of the kids  had an old car and we   d ride out to Elk River on Sunday afternoon and  swim in the river out there, all afternoon, two or three hours and come  back home. And one boy had a kind of a touring car. It had a top you   d  let down on it, I forgot what we   d call it. But they   d go around and pick  us all up, about eight or ten of us, and we   d go out to the river, stay for a  couple of hours or three. That was our entertainment. So, it   s been a  merry-go-round for me, you might say.  Where did your husband take you on your first date with him?  Oh, we had to go out of town for anything, so most the kids went to  Noble, Missouri or ran around like that. They had places up there that  you could   well, they had square dancing and round dancing but they  didn   t charge anything for it, kids you know. As I said, I had known him  before from when I came back home. And when I came back home after  I finished school and things like that, we dated a few times. I was about  twenty and he was twenty-four or somewhere along there. And he   d  never married. I asked him one time, I said,    How come you   re not  14  Belkam  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  married?    I said,    All these girls from around here.    He said,    Well, I  was just waiting for you.    (Laughs) I don   t know whether he was or not  or just told me that.  We were over in Noble   well, he had proposed to me and went ahead  and bought the license and everything you know, and I never had said I  would or wouldn   t, you know. I told him I had to think about that.  (Laughter) So he came and picked me up one Saturday evening and  well, he just told me,    I got all the papers and everything signed. We   re  just going to go get married this afternoon.    And that   s the way it was.  (Laughter) It wasn   t a big formal, fancy thing, but we had the deal. The  man we went to get our license signed and everything, and he did the  ceremony, his name was    I think he was a J.P. or something. Anyway,  we had everything all fixed out and I remember when we stood up  together to go through the ceremony he said,    I want y   all to turn around  and stand facing us this way.    He said,    That way you   re standing across  the boards instead of with the boards.    He said,    I want you with the  boards while you   re going through your ceremony.    And that   s what  happened. We were married that Saturday afternoon, and he had asked  me, but I had never said that I would or wouldn   t. Anyway, he said,     I   ve got all these papers fixed up now, more or less.    He was a little  older than me and ready to settle down I guess.  Ask her if she had a reception.  Well afterward did you have a reception or how did you tell people?  His mother had prepared for us. So we had it the next day then, his  family you know and things like that. We didn   t have a great big fancy  deal. She made a cake or had a cake made or something. I don   t know,  but anyway we had a cake and coffee at his folks     She was in on the planning then.  Huh?  She was in on the planning then.  Who was?  His mother.  Oh, yeah, she   uh-huh. She knew it was going to happen.  Even though you hadn   t said yes.  15  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Beg your pardon.  Even you though you hadn   t said yes.  Yes. (Laughs) They already had it made out.  Like an arranged marriage.  Beg your pardon?  Almost like an arranged marriage.  Well, first we went to the Methodist parsonage, and we was going to be  married by the Methodist. Well something come up and he wasn   t there  and he couldn   t be there, so we went over to the courthouse and had our  ceremony there.  Do you remember what you wore?  Yes. I had been working and I had on kind of a light beige colored suit.  I was working at Ben Franklin I guess or somewhere. We just went from  my job up to Noble, Missouri and that   s what happened. That   s been  kind of a wild story. (Laughs) But anyway, we were married thirty-nine  years.  And had one child?  Yes. And people   there were no jobs hardly, no nothing. So, we just  decided that we couldn   t manage a big family. He had two sisters and a  brother and so we lived there with his mother and they   d help buy the  home that we   re living in. That was our home then until we moved to  Grove and lived here down on the corner of Seventh Street. Our house is  still standing down about two blocks over, towards the schoolhouse.  That was our first home.  Did you ever do any traveling?  Not really. Only we   d go to down   there was only one place and there  wasn   t much to do in that day and time. So that we went with his brother  and their two little girls and his wife and his sister and we   d go down  and drive around Spavinaw (Oklahoma) and all, all out in the country.  But I already had been to Haskell College.  Then the Jay school, Jay, Oklahoma, had the night classes there,  business college, the teachers taught there. So I went to those night  schools and my husband would take me down there and wait on me until  16  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  I got through with classes. Like I said, it   s not been an easy life.  And they had owned their home and then they lost it so we bought the  home back then. He wanted to live there, so that   s where we lived. And  the house is still standing there. Of course, some of the younger kids  bought it and live there now, but they built a new house.  You said you taught Sunday school. Where did you teach?  Beg your pardon?  You said you taught Sunday school.  Did I   ?  You taught Sunday school.  I taught the girls, twelve-year-old girls.  And where was that at?  Here at First Baptist, in the church right down here. And we lived up on  the next block from the church on the corner.  How important was church?  Do what?  How important was church and religion to you growing up?  Well, we had   where I went to school, we had services by a minister  every other Sunday. We didn   t have services every Sunday, but we had  them every other Sunday, but we did have Sunday school. We wouldn   t  have any minister a lot of the times and so we   d have it about two or  three times a month. This pastor would have it, the pastor of the church,  he would come and preach for us and we   d go to Sunday school and  church, you know. Then he   d go back to his church and preach.  You didn   t have a minister every Sunday, then?  Well, sometimes we   d have a different   I don   t know what I   m trying to  say   pastors, you know, the different churches. We had to go. It was  compulsory for us to attend services and so that   s what we did, every  Sunday. Then when I went to college in Lawrence, Kansas, we had the  same thing, but it was much bigger. It was about a thousand kids there.  And I mean it was like a   I don   t know   as the old saying is, you had  17  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Belkam  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  to swim or get out of the water, but it was supposed to be compulsory  that we go to Sunday school and everything. We had to do that, unless  you were sick or something.  And then I   d get up at seven o   clock every morning. We had chores. We  couldn   t just go and go to school, we had to do some work and things to  help out with our board and room and stuff. So, I   d go over to the  hospital about seven-thirty or eight and I   d work for about an hour and  help out with the handing out of medicine and little things like that.  They   d fix them up and you   d give them to the students that were  supposed to have them. I did that and then on weekends, it   d be closed,  unless you were sick.  Now you recently celebrated your one hundredth birthday. Did you ever  think you   d make it to a hundred?  No, never dreamed I   d be that old.  And how was your party?  It was great, a big turnout. And I was surprised at the people that came,  you know, so many of them. I don   t know how many of them was there.  About sixty.  Sixty? That   s a lot.  It was out there. And she was a working and running back and forth and  so I said   I have time to dress myself and I thought   and I had some  nieces here and they kept saying,    You better get dressed, you better get  dressed.    I said,    Well, I think I can make it, you know, because I don   t  want to get dressed until I have to, you know?    So and then we had our  reception later. There at the church there was a big bunch of people  there, I   ll tell you.  Are you the first in your family to make it to one hundred?  To make what?  To make one hundred, to live to one hundred?  Yes, as far as I know. My great-great grandparents, there   s nobody. And  my mother was   she had one brother and four sisters, but some of the  sisters died younger. I didn   t know some of them they had. One of my  mother   s sisters, I was named after her, but I don   t remember her. She  was gone, I guess, when I was kind of young. But I do remember going  18  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Bishop  Walker  to some funeral, but I don   t remember whose it was now, when I was  younger you know, smaller. It was probably one of the sisters.  Well, what   s your secret of longevity?  I don   t have any secrets. I   m like Topsy. I just lived. (Laughter)  What do you think   s contributed to your long life?  Keeping busy, keeping my mind working and so forth. I didn   t have  time to sit and worry and grieve about stuff. I had other things that I had  to do and get done. And I knew if I didn   t do them, that I would be in  trouble or something, somebody would. So I just pushed myself and go.  As I say, we had our license and everything, he did, so I got off work  about four o   clock, and he came along and picked me up, and we went  to Noble, Missouri and we married over there at the Methodist  parsonage.  Now do you have a philosophy or motto you live by?  Not really, as I say, I just lived from day to day, you know, kind of like  nowadays. You don   t plan for much, you know.  How early do you get up?  Beg your pardon?  How early do you get up?  Well, usually about, before five thirty or six, or something like that.  Early.  In the morning, because you had to get up and get dressed. And my folks  lived out in the country then. My mother, and I had a stepfather, and  they lived out west of town, but I think now the lake has covered up  where we did live there. Out there the old road used to go west and it   d  turn back north. Now it goes straight from here to the bridge, see. But  we went down where the water   s covered, we   d go way out west about  two miles and then back north again, to get to where my folks were  living.  What is a typical day like for you now that you   re a hundred? What do  you   what   s a typical day like?  It   s not much only just sitting here in this chair. I don   t plan anything  19  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Belkam  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  because I don   t know what, you know. I try to help her with planning the  meals and doing things like that. Kind of something to keep my mind  kind of stirring.  Do you read?  Do I what?  Read any books or   ?  Do I?  Do you read any books?  Oh yeah, I do a lot of reading. Not as much as I used to, but my eyes are  getting bad, so I don   t try to overwork them.  She does a lot of word puzzles.  And I usually try to go to bed about nine o   clock, ten, somewhere  around there.  So in bed around nine or ten.  I never was a night owl, stay up all night and prowl. (Laughter)  Well, when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  Well, I just lived a clean life. I didn   t have time for all these vices these  kids do nowadays, running around and more or less. We had to make our  own entertainment, more or less you know. Now kids have things  planned for them, but we did our own, just our own things for whatever  we could come up with. Everybody was kind of more or less in the same  boat, you know. Wasn   t a lot of work and running around for us to do,  you know.  Well, do you play the piano?  No. As I said, I didn   t have time for that.  I guess daughter does?  I sing in the choir at church. And I wanted her to play and she plays, but,  she never touches it anymore. And there was about six or eight little  girls about her age that started going to school and I think they all  practiced more on that piano we got than they did at home. They   d come  20  Finchum  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Bishop  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  and she   d say,    Well, I can   t.    And I   d say,    Oh, yes you can.    You said,     Just tell them you have to practice your music.    And so, I had a time  getting her to practice her music, because they all had something  planned to do or whatever you know. And I   d say,    Whenever you get  through your music, you can go, but you gotta go through that a time.    I  wanted to make a good musician out of her, but she didn   t take to music  too good. (Laughter) So I said,    Well so long as you know how to play.  If you need to, you can.    And so.  Well, do you remember getting your first television?  I don   t know. It   s been quite a while when we first bought. Not too long  after they came out, we bought our first one. And we didn   t  watch  TV  much because some of the girls would come over and even though they  had a piano at home, they   d come over to my house and practice. I said,     There   s some other kid banging on that piano all the time.    (Laughs)  Is there anything on your bucket list that you still want to do?  Beg your pardon.  Do you still have anything in life that you want to do?  No. I don   t plan anything because I   m not able to do anything now, so I  don   t. I just enjoy my grandkids when they   re here and doing things like  that. I have a grandson here now and my daughter, she retired last year,  so she   s been here since oh, about a month now, but I   ve lived on my  own for all these years.  Well, any advice for someone who wants to live to a hundred?  For what?  For wanting to live to a hundred? Any advice?  Well, I hadn   t thought too much about it, because there   s not much you  can do when you get a hundred.  That   s true.  I just, as I say, I just from day to day, I don   t plan anything you know.  Unless it   s something for the kids that come or something like that.  Well, thank you for letting us come today.  Well, I   ve enjoyed your company. I hope got some things that you could  21  Finchum  publish about me.  Oh, you   re good, you   re fine. Thank you.  -------  -------
