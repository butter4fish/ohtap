Walters Not much, not much.  Finchum Just fish and banana pudding.  A. Walters Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I fried the fish all the time. I fried the fish all  the time. You could put a match in that grease. When that match spews,  the grease was hot enough to seal it on the outside where it   s not greasy.  Finchum Well there you go, Alex.  A. Walters Yeah, put a match in that grease and when that spews, well the grease is  so hot it seals that fish on the outside. It comes out a golden brown.  20  R. Walters That   s an old fashioned thermometer.  Finchum Really? I   ve never heard that.  R. Walters The match will ignite when the grease gets to about 325 or thirty  degrees.  Finchum Then you put your fish in?  R. Walters And that   s when you start cooking.  Finchum In an iron skillet?  A. Walters Yeah, yeah, an old iron skillet. Holds three pounds of Crisco. I put three  pounds of Crisco in it.  R. Walters It was a big skillet.  Finchum Biggest, yeah.  R. Walters Big skillet.  Bishop I would imagine you caught a lot of fish when you went out.  R. Walters When he and Mom used to go down to the Eufaula, they would write  down on the calendar each day how many fish they cleaned, and at the  end of the year he would bring me the calendar and say,    Here, add  these up.    He said,    I   ve added them up several times, and I get a  different number every time.    He knew I had a calculator, and several,  several times it would be well over 2,000 fish.  Bishop Oh my...  R. Walters In a year   s time.  Bishop Oh my gosh. (Laughs)  R. Walters That   s not a fish story. That   s a true story.  Finchum What would you use for bait?  A.

Didn   t have money to buy any  minnows, but we buy a few jigs. We try not to lose them in the brush.  Finchum Not nightcrawlers?  A. Walters No, no, no.  Finchum My grandmother used nightcrawlers.  A. Walters Yeah.  Finchum I couldn   t do it. I had to do corn. Wasn   t fun putting that on the hook.  Bishop It   s like catfish. I stuck with livers and not the stink-bait. Well, when  history is all said and done, what do you want to be remembered for?  A. Walters I tried to live a good life. I tried to live a good life, that   s all I know.  Treated my fellow man like I wanted to be treated.  Bishop Do you have a motto or a philosophy you live by?  A. Walters Oh, I don   t reckon. I don   t reckon I had a motto.

Walters They had been married seventy-seven years when Mom passed away,  but he said,    We dated for three years,    so that   s nearly eighty years  that they had been together.  A. Walters But the best part about it, she was sick three weeks and gone. A lot of  people, a lot of old people, you   re sick for six months. After she passed  away, Ronald called me and told me,    Momma   s gone, and I   m going  to see her. Do you want to meet me there?    Yeah, I met him up there  and I got to thinking,    What   s this going to be like?    But I waited and I  got up there. She was laying on the bed, and she was just as pretty, the  prettiest woman I   ve ever seen in my life. The swelling had all gone  27  out, and she was just laying there. After I seen her, I didn   t grieve. I  said,    Some of these days I   ll go to the Lord, to go to Heaven, and see  her up there then,    but after I seen her and she was gone. Well I was  going up there and I got to studying,    What   s going to go on?    And  when I got up there and I seen her laying there on the bed, that was it.  That was it.  Finchum She looked peaceful.  A. Walters Peaceful, that   s right, that   s right.  Finchum That   s a long time to be married.  A. Walters That   s it, that   s it, that   s it.

Sometimes I   d do something she didn   t  like, and sometimes she   d do something I didn   t like, but we lived.  Lived over it, forget and forgive.  Finchum Well, did she work?  A. Walters No, she was a house woman, and worked out a little bit, but nothing to  speak of. She canned and kept house.  Finchum And watched him.  A. Walters Yeah, cooked.
