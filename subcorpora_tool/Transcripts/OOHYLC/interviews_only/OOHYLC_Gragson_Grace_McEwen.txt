 Finchum  Today is June 5, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Jones, Oklahoma to speak with Grace Gragson. Did I pronounce that  right?  Grace McEwen Gragson. Yes.  Okay. So thank you for having us today. This is part of our 100 Year Life  Project, so let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were  born?  I was born March 23, 1913 in Edmond, Oklahoma on land that is now  owned by the college there.  What did your parents do for a living at that point?  Well, my dad farmed some and he worked in cotton gins quite a lot and  ended up being a farmer.  And your mother?  She didn   t work. She stayed home and kept kids.  So she worked a little bit then. How many children did she have?  Three.  Clyde was two years older than me.  I   m three years older than  my little sister and between us they lost a baby, but I don   t know how.  No one ever said.  And where did you go to school?  5  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  First school was Seven C, right out here at Anderson and 108th, and  when I was six years old we moved to 122nd and Post Road. Then I  graduated eighth grade at Red Top and Red Top was on Douglas and  108th, three miles west of Seven C.  And did you go beyond eighth grade?  I graduated from Jones High School in 1931.  Thirty-one. Did you have a favorite subject?  A what?  Favorite subject?  Algebra. My teacher taught me algebra and I loved it. Some of the kids  never did catch on to it. (Laughs).  You   re brave.  (Laughter) Yes. Superintendent  Frederick    somehow, we just  connected because he, I don   t remember, he was explaining and it just  hit me. I could  understand it , I loved it, but some of the other kids  never did catch on to it, I don   t think. In fact, we only had four in our  class. (Laughs) I married the boy. Three girls and a boy and I married  the boy (laughter) later on.  Well, how would you get to school?  My sister and I had to walk a little over one mile and caught a school  bus. We rode the school bus.  When you were in the eighth grade or when you when you were in first  grade?  No, in first grade I walked, and up to the eighth grade I walked. We  walked two miles, around two miles, and we had to walk a little over a  mile to catch a school bus. Oh, well my brother graduated when I was a  freshman and he had a car. He drove us to school my freshman year, but  those next three years we had to walk to the school bus.  What were some of the things you did for fun during those days?  Played basketball. I loved it  (Laughs).  Half court, full court?  6  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Well, it was sure different than it is now cause the girls   it was divided  into three sections: forwards, jump center and side center, and the  guards. I was jump center and I must have been about seventh grade,  maybe, we had a tournament at Britton School. When we got home, our  teacher was our coach, and he told me that the coach of the other team     I was jump center   and he said,    That jump center is in a class by  herself.    So it sounded like I might have been the best player on the  court (Laughs).  What would you wear to play in?  Well, we had to wear black bloomers (laughs) at that time, and later on  before we got out of high school we had bought suits, but we started out  with bloomers. (Laughs)  Well would the other teams come to your school or would you go to  theirs?  Both.  Both?  Sometimes we   d go to Luther or State Center or someplace else to play,  and then they   d come to  us . It   s like they do today. They had to play  here and then play there.  That would have been in some of the time during the depression. Do you  have any memories of that?  When I was a freshman?  The Depression     Oh, Depression.  The Depression.  Man, I tell you, I   ve scoured my house many times trying to find a  penny to go buy a loaf of bread. (Laughs) Now, that was something else  that   dust storms and all that stuff. I was through that.  And you were young, but do you remember anything about the influenza,  the flu epidemic?  The what?  7  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  The flu epidemic?  No.  Too young?  No, my mother nursed a lot of people, took care of them through that,  but she never did get it, but a lot of people did. This Gragson that I  married, his mother died when he was four years old with the flu. The  kids had to take him to school with them, the older kids, because he  was   yes he was the youngest and he was four. He told me the older  sister   one day they were at school and she got in trouble for something  and she had to stand at the blackboard with her nose in the thing. This  little kid felt sorry for her so he went out and found a brick to put under  her feet so she could stand on it (laughter), because it stretched her up to  get her nose in that circle. (Laughter)  You sure couldn   t do that today, could you? Well was your husband in  the war?  No.  He didn   t go to the military?  No. There was a place there that they were too young and then they were  just too old, but he was too young always.  Well, do you remember when World War I was over   World War II was  over?  Yes, but I remember when World War I was over, too.  You do?  My uncle was in World War I. Mother   s, one of mother   s brothers. He  came home and my brother Clyde and I   he came to our house. I don   t  know whether it was that day he came, but anyway he came and Clyde  and I were down the road. We lived down north from Jones in a little old  house, and Clyde and I were down the road a ways, up in a, well a tree.  (Laughter) That   s the thing that bothers me, I can   t remember words to  say. This little old tree and our Uncle Louin came down there and said,     What are you monkeys doing up in that tree?     Having a little bit of fun.  8  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  That was the after the   and his younger brother, this Uncle Louin, was  at the dock, ready to go overseas when it quit, so he didn   t have to go.  Another thing of this Uncle Louin, they were in Germany and they were  dropping, Germans were dropping bombs all over. Well, they were  hiding out in a potato patch for a few nights and Uncle Louin, that day,  went out and found another place for them to stay. That night the  Germans bombed that potato patch off of the earth. They just barely got  out in time. Another one of my cousin   s husband, he was bombardier  in   this was in World War II. One of the bombs got stuck in the  airplane. He had to get on that bomb and ride it down to unstick it.  Things happen in a war.  Once you graduated from high school, what did you do?  After I graduated? Well, I went to Edmond for six months or something  and then I got married.  To the boy in your  class ? Yes, okay.  To  Woody  McEwen, yes. That   s  my children   s father .  That would have been 1931 or    32?  Thirty    yep. Yep,    32.  Where did he take you for your first date?  What?  Where did your husband take you on your first date?  I don   t even remember the first date. (Laughter) Probably some place at  the school. Jones used to didn   t have electricity, and they had a Delco  system down here, used to have a water tower right there, a little bit east  of the Sonic  Drive-In . Just a couple of doors down. At a certain time of  night, I think it was maybe ten o   clock, if we had anything at the school,  they   d blink the lights. Well, you knew that you had to get everything  ready and get out of there in fifteen minutes cause in fifteen minutes the  lights went out. That   s when they turned the Delco off, at nine fifteen.  (Laughter)  Did they have school dances?  No.  No.  9  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  No.  What did your husband do for a living?  Not much of anything I   ll tell you (Laughs). We had cows. My mother-in-  law   s brother was a captain of a ship, a merchant ship I guess because  they hauled stuff to Japan, China, and all around. He retired and came  here to live with her and they bought the farm that I live on now, by the  schoolhouse here, in 1939, was before 1940. We   my husband and I,  Uncle Bill, the guy that retired from the ship, he sold his half because  my husband   s mother and dad went half and half with her brother. We  bought his half and got a loan from Farm something. I don   t remember  that name, but it was in Oklahoma City. Well, we paid that off and then  borrowed the rest of the money from my dad. My husband never did pay  him and so when my dad died, why, my inheritance from him was that  he gave me the rest of the farm. My brother got a farm that they had  bought out northwest of here (Jones). My sister got the house they lived  in right down here on Main Street in Jones. They just had us three kids.  Did you work outside of the home?  I did, later on, in 1963. Well, I worked at different jobs sometimes. The  first one that I really liked was at an Election Board in Oklahoma City. I  really liked that job. Then the banker here, well there was two brothers  that owned the bank there for a while, and he saw my predicament. I  guess he knew the treasurer of the county and he told him to put me to  work, and so I went to work in the Treasurer   s Office for a little while.  Then one of my best friend   s daughter, I don   t know where she worked,  but she found out that in the county welfare department the lady that was  clinic clerk, which what she did was the county had free doctor and free  medicine for those that were eligible. Well that was my job, was to  interview them to find out if they was eligible. She called me. I was  working at John A. Brown   s at that time, counting out green stamps to  mail to people that had bought on time. So anyway, I went and  interviewed with the boss of the county welfare department and I got the  job. I worked there till I retired and you had to work in the county fifteen  years. Well, I just barely made the fifteen. I think I was about sixteen or  seventeen years, is what I worked, counting this that I   d worked down at  the courthouse in the Treasurer   s Office and the Election Board there  and that   s my life. (Laughter)  So what year did you retire?  In 1976.  10  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Seventy-six. Do you remember voting for the first time?  What?  Voting? Do you remember going to vote the first time?  I voted. No, I don   t remember the first time I voted. I used to work when  they voted here at Jones, and I helped count votes and you had to count  them. I worked that too.  Do you remember your first airplane that you saw?  Saw the first airplane?  Yes.  Nope, I don   t remember it at all.  First refrigerator?  Yes, I remember that. We bought a little small refrigerator and as I was  saying, my husband would rather buy whiskey than pay his bills so we  couldn   t pay for it. So my aunt, instead of us having to just turn it back,  my aunt took the refrigerator and paid it off then. So that was my first     well, the rest of them were iceboxes. We had an icebox when I was a  kid, of course. You   d have to buy your ice and put it up top. Put a pan  under there to catch the drip.  Did Jones have an ice plant?  No.  No?  Jones never has had an ice plant.  Where would you get it from?  Well, we had to go somewhere and buy it, mostly Oklahoma City.  Oklahoma City. Has Jones changed a lot since your high school days?  No, not a whole lot.  No, not really?  11  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Course, it is different stores now than then.  Did it have a theater?  We used to have. Carrol   s dad  Mr. Bell  had it     Oh        a theater when they came to Jones, yes. Now the police station is in  that building down there on Main Street.  Well, when you went to Edmond to go to college, what were you going to  study?  Oh, well I was taking shorthand and typing. I liked that, too.  Shorthand, they don   t teach anymore.  Don   t they?  No.  Oh, well I will say.  Do you remember how to do any of it?  No, I don   t remember any of it at all. (Laughs)  Did you have brothers and sisters?  I had one brother  Clyde  and one sister. As I say between Ruth, my  baby sister was named Ruth, and they lost a baby, but they never did tell  me why to.  How was your relationship with your brother and sister?  Oh, it was good (Laughs).  Yes.  My sister and I played together all the time and my brother took care of  us. One of the things is   my sister was probably six years old or  something like that. Well it was like 1923, we had a flood. A dam broke  here and out at our house it was knee deep water all around the house  and the next   it was in the fall, so it might have been the next winter, or  it might have been that winter because the water was still down in the  12  Finchum  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  pasture and it was froze over. Mother and Dad had gone somewhere and  left us three kids at home by ourselves and we decided to go skating.  Well, Clyde skated around and got out, and I was down a little ways, I  skated and got out, and my little sister, Ruth, started to skate and to get  up to where Clyde had gotten out and she fell through. The ice was thin.  It was real cold, but it was sunny. We had a day like that this past winter.  Clyde jumped in and got her out and we had to walk quite a little ways  to the house because this was down across the field into the pasture. I  know those kids liked to froze to death before we got home to get those  doggone old wet clothes off, but we had a lot of fun. We had to, of  course, make all of our    fun.    In fact one of the things   I was a tomboy.  I don   t think there was a tree that had a limb down close enough for me  to get a hold of that I didn   t climb, because I liked climbing trees.  Daddy bought oil in fifty gallon iron barrels. Well, when one would get  empty I would lay it over on its side and climb up on top of it and roll it  and walk. Well one day I fell, broke my tooth off. I got most of my own  teeth which the dentist says is kind of unusual. But anyway, and then we  had to make our stilts. We took a big long board and nailed a little two-by-  four thing there to step on and put a little strap of something to  hold  on feet  there and we   d make our stilts and walked.  We   d take a hoop off of an old wagon wheel and we   d make it   took a  lass and put a little cross piece on the back and we   d roll that wagon  wheel with that stick. When you live out there five miles in the country,  there   s nothing to do but do it yourself, make all your little things. So we  made a lot of things like that.  What was church very important?  Well, we didn   t go to church, not until later on.  What about holidays? Did you have any family traditions during  holidays?  Yes, usually we went to my mother   s folks. They lived out southeast of  Jones here and we went to their   I remember, well they lived right north  of Jones here one year. I must have been four years old or something  like that and it was snow. I don   t know how deep the snow was.  Anyhow, my dad took the wagon box off of the wheels to make a sled  out of and hitched the horses to this sled and that was for Christmas. We  went to Grandma Tillers for Christmas and when I got close enough to  Grandma Tiller, well she stepped out on the porch and I      I got a dolly,  I got a dolly     (Laughter) I got a doll for Christmas and I had to show  her my doll.  13  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Roads at the time were probably pretty rough?  Well, I guess so. We just had a horse and buggy. We didn   t have a car  for a long time. In fact, we didn   t have a car in 1918 when Uncle Louin  came home from the war. He got a car right after that and this is the  story. My mother   s youngest sister is just five years older than me. She  was telling a story when mother first got into a car to drive my brother  Clyde he must have been six or seven years old or something. Oh I don   t  know, maybe he was littler older than that. Anyhow, she drove up to go  somewhere and when she come back, she didn   t know how to stop.  (Laughter) She just a kept a going and my brother Clyde reached over  and turned the key off. That little kid    so he stopped her (laughter)  from running into the barn or something.  Well, did she make your clothes? Did your mother sew?  Mother sewed wonderful. I had   the first bought thing I had, I was  probably twelve years old and this Aunt Freda, that   s just five years  older than me, she was a school teacher. She taught school all her life  and she bought me a new coat and that   s the first bought thing that I had,  because mother made everything. Yes. Mother was a good seamstress.  Yes.  Did she teach you?  Well, she tried to, (laughter) but I couldn   t do anything to please her.  Everything I   d do, she   d find something wrong with it. (Laughter) Oh,  I   ll tell you another thing. When I was, I must have been eight years old,  maybe seven or eight, and I was trying to sew something at the sewing  machine. I got my finger under the needle. Stuck the needle through my  fingernail here, and of course I was yelling. Mother came in and took it  out, turned the wheel on the machine and took it out. Well, I was awful  hurt and so she made a sling for me to put my arm in. I had to go out  doors to my daddy and my brother and I said,    I got stuck in the needle.     (Laughs) I had to go show them my sore finger. Oh goodness.  Well, how did you do laundry?  What?  How did you do laundry?  Well over a board, I tell you. (Laughs)  Did you?  14  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Yes and let me tell you a story. When these stores have sales, watch it. I  wanted this stomper to stomp my dirty clothes before I   d put them in the  tub to wash. Montgomery Ward   s had a sale stomper for forty-five cents  and I told my sister, she was working at that time   that   s when I had the  kids and everything. I said,    Go down there at Ward   s and get this  stomper. I need one.    So she went and got it and come home with it. The  paper tag was tied to the handle and I was looking at it. On the sticker on  it, marked in a black pencil, thirty-nine cents. So if we   d bought before  the sale, we could have got it for thirty-nine cents rather than forty-five  cents.  Same thing happened not too many years ago, one of the stores  downtown had our   I belong to the Rebekah Lodge, which is the ladies  of the Odd Fellow Lodge and we needed a refrigerator. If you came  down Britton Road out here, well you saw the lodge with its pole up  with the light on it. Well, one of the other ladies and I went to this store  with a   they had a sale on refrigerators so we went there and bought  one. We didn   t have any way to get it home, but I paid for it. A week or  so later, one of the Odd Fellows were going to town and he had a pickup  and I said,    Let   s go by and get the refrigerator we bought.    So we went  over there and he said,    Let   s go back here and look,    so we walked  back in the other end before we decided to pick up the refrigerator. Same  refrigerator that we bought on sale was less than what I had paid, so we  went up. They refunded me a hundred dollars or something.  Anyhow, so these sales, don   t buy sales. Wait until the sale gets over  with and you   ll get it cheaper. Now this Jack that had taken us he had  bought a computer there earlier and the same thing happened to him  when he   d bought it. He went back when the sale was over and went and  looked. Sure enough it was cheaper then, than when he   d paid for it. It  wasn   t just one thing. Everything in there   d been upped. So I don   t go  for these sales anymore. (Laughter)  So Jones had a Montgomery Ward?  No.  No.  It was in Oklahoma City.  Oklahoma City.  In fact Jones didn   t   this superintendent that taught me algebra, he  taught for three years and then he quit and opened a store, a grocery  store. Down there, the building east of the Sonic down here is Mr.  15  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Fredrick   s store. He put in a   he   d buy sour cream. All the other years  we had to haul ours. We lived on the farm, milked all the time. The sour  cream we had to take to Oklahoma City to sell. Well, when he put that  in, why then we could sell it there. My sister Ruth and I, we worked for  him for a while. Back then you had to buy all your own school books,  maybe you still do. But anyhow, he put in school books and sold and we  helped there, and I ironed for them. His wife was a teacher also and they  had two: a boy and a girl. The girl was too young to go to school and I  ironed her skirts and the little skirts about this long. (Laughs) I ironed  for the ex-teacher and his wife. She still taught, but he run the store.  Was it an electric iron?  No.  No.  We had to heat them on the stove and clamp down on them.  Those were the days. Right?  Those were the days. (Laughs)  Describe your house that you grew up in.  It was a two-story house. The kitchen, the dining room, the living room,  the bedroom, and there   s two rooms upstairs. My brother had one on the  northeast corner and my sister and I had the one on the southeast corner.  We got the nice cool breeze in the summer time and he didn   t.  How was it heated?  We had a wood stove and then a coal stove.  Pretty cold in the winter?  No, it was   if you had enough fuel, it was nice and warm.  And bathroom?  No, no. We had a path. (Laughter)  With a Montgomery Ward catalog at the end?  Did what?  16  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  With the Montgomery Ward catalog?  No, well, we had catalogs. We had Montgomery Ward and Sears both.  Usually they ended it up in the outhouse?  They went to the outhouse, yes. (Laughter) Sure did.  Did you mother can?  Oh yes.  Was she a member of a homemaker club?  Yes. It   s called a home demonstration club back then. They   ve changed  its name now, and I belonged to it too until I went to work.  Did you take things to the county fair?  Yep. I   ve worked there, too.  What would you take?  What would I take?  What would you take?  I made suits for my two boys. John and Bill are my two boys. I made  little suits for them. I didn   t get first place, but I got something. I don   t  remember now, third, maybe third. Second or third. Red or white ribbon.  The blue ribbon or green, whatever, was first. The red was second. Third  white I think, back then.  Where would you have to go to get your fabric?  To get my what?  Fabric?  Oh, we had to go to Oklahoma City for everything. (Laughter).  Everything? Okay.  Yes. Except groceries. Now, we   d come to Jones to get some groceries  now and then.  17  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Well at what point did you realize,    Hey, I may make it to 100?     I never thought about making it to 100. If it hadn   t been for this Lord  Jesus, I wouldn   t be here now either. In 1990, I discovered a lump in my  breast, my left breast. Well, I went to the doctor and of course it was  cancer, and he said it had been there about a year and I hadn   t done  anything about it. They did surgery and took out some and took the  lymph nodes from this arm and sent me home to go back the next day or  two for more surgery. I was laying there on the bed, August the ninth,  1990 at one nineteen in the afternoon, and I was just praying and  something moved across my breast. Just like if you take an eraser and  smear it across the blackboard. That   s what it felt like. So I went back  then to have this additional surgery, up to Edmond hospital, and as the  nurse was wheeling me back to my room she said,    They didn   t have to  take out near as much as they thought they were going to have to.    So  the Lord, he healed me. I haven   t had anything since, since 1990 to right  now. So if it hadn   t been for the Lord, I wouldn   t have been here, and I  still give him thanks for it.  Has anyone else in your family lived to be 100?  This Aunt Freda that is five years older than me. She, her birthday was  the tenth of April. She was 100 then at the tenth of April. Well, John and  Carol always   you can   t shoot firecrackers here in Jones. They do it on  the fourth, the town does it, but John and Carol did it on the farm out  south here half a mile. Every fourth of July, all the little kids around and  all the kinfolks, we go out to John and Carol   s to have supper, and they  shoot firecrackers all afternoon on the fourth of July. Well Aunt Freda  and I went out there that night. She   d been feeling kind of bad and I  drove her out and I asked her how she was feeling and she says,    I feel  better than I   ve felt in a long time.    Well, the reason we go like that is  because we don   t want to stay the whole time those kids are out there  shooting firecrackers. We come home and go to bed. (Laughs) So  anyway, the next morning her neighbor, Aunt Freda   s neighbor next  door, always got her paper and threw it up on her porch for her, and she  went out and got her paper and went back in and set down in her rocker  and the paper fell on the floor. She sat there and died just after getting up  and getting her paper, and so she lived 100 from April to July the fifth.  Wow     But that   s the only one. Mother   s third one down, mother   s the second  girl. There was a boy and Aunt Pearl and then Mother. She lived; she  was I think in her nineties. I   m not sure whether ninety-three or ninety-four.  Anyway her dining room chairs had rollers on them. Well she went  to sit down in this chair one day and it rolled out from under her and she  18  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  fell, sitting on the floor, and it broke her hip. Well, she laid in the  hospital for quite a while and then came home to sit in the bed, too. But  that broken hip finally took her life, but she was in her nineties. Aunt  Freda is the only one that lived to be 100.  Do you have any idea why, what contributed to the longevity?  The Lord.  Yes.  Just the Lord did it. (Laughs) I   ve had some close calls a time or two  with my car or something. I haven   t had any problems at all, but anyway  I   ve had some awful close calls. What? Twice. It   s the guy that   s gonna  turn. He doesn   t   shoot, he don   t tell you he   s gonna turn. He don   t turn  his signal on and you think you can go and here he is turning at you.  Twice now I   ve had real close   one fellow bumped my back fender a  little bit, but another one   that hasn   t been too long ago at the filling  station. It was back when the price was going up and this guy was a few  cents cheaper and everybody was going in there. I used to bowl. After  this 1990, my niece got me to bowling. She liked to bowl, and she got  me and they needed somebody. I wasn   t very good, but I enjoyed it. But  anyway, I had stopped at this filling station on the way home from  bowling and I had already filled up and was about to turn out. Well  here   s this guy coming and I thought he was going on and I could go  around. Well, here he came right at me. Well I turned, but I was facing  east and in the west traffic. Well, there was a car out at Twenty-third  Street has a   most places have a wide spot in the center that nobody  drives in there. Well here I was and this car went back by here and here  come an old truck and boy he was just barreling down. I zipped around  got in the center lane. (Laughs) I was fussing at that old guy because he  didn   t turn his signal on.  Do you still drive today?  I drove today down here. I drive around here. I come to church and I go  to the grocery store and things like that, but I don   t try to go to  Oklahoma City or anything like that anymore. Well one reason, I only  have one eye and I   ve got to go get shots in it. I already had it one last  week. There   s some blood in it and I have to take shots in my eye, three  shots. This one, back in about 2004 or something like that, I noticed that  I   it was, I couldn   t see as good as I should. I didn   t think I had my  phone number of the guy, the eye doctor that I   d been going to. So I  messed around and didn   t go to the eye doctor. When I finally did, why  they sent me to a retina man a Dr. Lawrence over on, well let   s see, way  19  Finchum  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  out west here in Oklahoma City. Anyway, he said it looks like it had  started to heal itself and anything he would do might make it worse so  he just left it alone. Well, it finally healed in about six years. It took  about that long for it to heal, but it left a, it has scar tissue right in the  front. I can see all around, but straight out I can   t see. Well, this one I  noticed a little while after that started doing the same. Well I went to the  eye doctor right quick then and I   m still going. This other one was  starting this ruptured retina also. I   m going to this doctor, retina doctor.  A while back, well it   s been three or four years I guess back, he started  giving me shots in my eye. He caught that in time to do some about it,  but this other one he couldn   t do anything. But anyhow, a while back  there was a little bit of blood in this one and they give me shots in this  eye. Now then, what month was it? Well it was six weeks ago anyhow, a  little over six weeks. He said there   s blood in this eye. I   ve had one shot  and I   ve got to go back in six weeks, two more times. Next time it will  be the nineteenth of July and I have to go the next time to get another  shot in it and I have to take certain eye drops. My appointment   s at eight  o   clock in the morning. At seven I have to put a drop in my eye. One  drop and every fifteen minutes after that for four times I have to take yet  another drop in there until I go to the doctor.  I hope someone else is driving you.  Oh yes. (Laughter) John and Carrol I tell you, I couldn   t live without  them. Couldn   t live at home without them. I   d have to go to a nursing  home or something. Yes. Yes, so but I have to go back and get two more  shots now six weeks apart. I can still see and I read. That   s my thing. I  like to do puzzles. Try them. (Laughter) Some of these things in the  newspaper now are so hard that I can   t do anything about it.  What   s a typical day like for you? What time do you get up and     Well, I   m up always before five o   clock, nearly always before five  o   clock. In fact, for my supper   well I eat from five thirty to six,  somewhere in there, half a sandwich and drink about a half a Coke or  something. Then I have to get up three or four times in the night to go to  the bathroom. (Laughs) The last time I got up this morning, it was a little  after four and I had to get up and go to the bathroom, so I just got up this  morning.  And what do you do during the day? What   s a typical day like in your  life?  Sitting in that recliner and read books and play puzzles.  20  Bishop  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Finchum  Do you have a favorite book or a favorite author?  I like them westerns. (Laughter) I   m an old cowboy gal.  And what time would you go to bed then?  I go to bed from eight thirty to nine thirty, somewhere in there, if I   m  reading. After Wheel of Fortune   s over with, I turn  the TV  off and read  or try to get some of the crossword puzzles. Some of those they   re hard  and I don   t know anything. I   ve worn out three or four books trying to  find the answers to some of them things.  Do you use a dictionary?  I   ve got two dictionaries, (laughter) and by the way I was born Easter  Sunday. I was born Easter Sunday and I don   t know if it   s just a while  back or   I think he was talking about one of the days later   earlier I  mean. The weatherman   started out real nice warm day and it ended up  freezing cold on that Easter when I was born. Just the other day he was  talking about the same thing. It was gonna be real hot to start out with  and then it turns out real cold. That what it was, Mother said, when I was  born.  Were you born at home?  I don   t know.  You don   t know?  No, I don   t know. No one ever told me (Laughter), but I expect we were  because I don   t know whether Edmond had a hospital at that time or not.  Nobody ever told me.  One thing I forgot to ask was, when you were growing up did you ever in  your life win any awards or achievements?  I don   t understand you.  As a child or growing up as an adult, did you ever win any awards?  Oh yes. Yes, I could run. I   ve got gold medals from running while I was  in grade school at Red Top. In fact, the historical society down here at  the   did you see the train caboose down here?  Yes.  21  Finchum  Bishop  Gragson  Finchum  Gagson  Finchum  Gragson  Well right next to that caboose is the museum. Well in that museum  there   s a dozen cups that we won. Our race team, I guess you   d call it,  but for the fifty-yard dash I lacked a half a second of having the record.  Come to find out my aunt, one of my mother   s sisters, had the record at  six. I ran it in six and a half seconds and she could run it at six seconds,  the fifty-yard dash. Well I have a little gold square with a runner  pictured on it at home and the hundred-yard dash I have the little gold  thing. I don   t remember what my hundred-yard dash time was and then  for overall we had the relay race and fifty or hundred and the baseball  throw. Well, I couldn   t throw the baseball, but one of my teammates     she could throw that ball a mile, I   ll tell you.  In this six and a half seconds, I thought I was running as fast as I could.  There was this girl that throwed the baseball, here she was. I could  outrun her and I tripped up. If I would have run as hard as I ended up  when I started, I would have maybe beat Aunt Audrey   s time. (Laughter)  When you see somebody there that you know you can outrun, you step  on it. (Laughter) Here I thought I was running, but I wasn   t. I do have  the school medals that I won. That   s when I was in grade school, seventh  and eighth grade.  Today in life at 101, do you have motto you live by? Do you have a  philosophy that you follow in life?  No, I   m just here (laughs) doing whatever I want to. I never even  thought about living this long, but I still don   t feel like I   m that old. The  Baptist church up here the first Tuesday every month, they have a dinner  for the elderly people, I guess you call it. They have a speaker or some  kind of a program each time and this was a minister from somewhere  else. I don   t know where he come from but they were talking me, and  that   s when I was just turning 100, and I said,    I sure don   t feel like I   m  100.    He said,    You sure don   t look it either.     You don   t. (laughter)  Well, one thing, my hair hasn   t turned gray. This little spot here, my  Grandma Tiller, Mother   s mother, was gray headed, but right down the  back of her head she had a streak of black hair. My mother was a  redhead and right down the back of her head, she had a white streak.  Well, I had to be different, my white streak   s in the front. (Laughter)  Well, it   s very pretty. So you married a second time? You   ve been  married twice?  Yes. My first husband,  John   s  daddy. I don   t know what happened. I  had come home from work, he died in 1968. I come in and we were then  22  Finchum  Gragson  living with his parents, where I   m living now. His mother said he still  had pajamas on. She said,    He   s been in bed all day. He hasn   t even got  up to eat anything,    and I ask him if he would like to have a glass of  milk, so he said yes. So I went and got a glass of milk and set it in the  window there beside him where he could reach it and then went to the  bathroom. Well when I was in the bathroom, I heard him coughing and  when I come out and went in there his face was the color that   black as  a colored man.  Well, I rushed and called the doctor. He was a little old DO or  something. He wasn   t a MD. Well he came up and give him a shot of  some kind, I don   t of what. Anyway, I had already gone and called an  ambulance, because he   d been in the hospital a time or two for    they  said what they working on was his lungs. They had like dirt in each lung  or something, whatever that was. He never had been anywhere to get dirt  in it. Of course we lived on a farm. He didn   t do that much blowing  around on the farm. Took him to the hospital and that was the end of it.  Well I had got there while he was still in the emergency room, and they  was getting ready to take him upstairs to somewhere and they asked me  if I wanted to ride up in the elevator with him. I said,    No, I   ll go in and  check him in,    to get him a bed. Well I went in to check him in and they  told me then to go up to a little waiting room and wait up there. Anyway,  it wasn   t long until someone came in. They said he was gone. I said I  was afraid of that and I was. I still don   t know what...I have the autopsy.  You see we had a doctor and a pharmacy there where I worked. I told  her and somehow she got this autopsy for me and it was a lady doctor  there. I have that, but I still don   t know what the   I can   t read all her  terms that they used, but anyway. That was it. His dad died in 1967, he  died in 1968, six months later, and his mother died in 1969. I had three  burials within three years.  And then you remarried?  Yes, I remarried in 1977 and it lasted until 1979. That was something  else too. He   d been married to this woman, married and divorced three  times, and I thought surely he was done with her by that time. He  wasn   t. He went back to her after two years with me. (Laughs) Then she  had a stroke or something and was in a nursing home, or going to be in a  nursing home. It was just a home that took people in and he had to go  and sit with her every day. He didn   t last very long. She died, but he  lasted maybe a couple of years. I think it run him crazy to have to stay  with her like that, but he was a mail carrier back in them days when you  had to walk around. This wife followed him all the time. She was so  jealous of him. She   d drive around behind him.  23  Bishop  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Bishop  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Gragson  Finchum  Well when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  Just tell them I   m glad I   m here as long as I stay, as long as the Lord  let   s me stay.  Grandma Grace. Grandma Grace.  Grandma Grace. Carrol   s daughter Annette, sometime back if you read  that newspaper you might have seen it, I should brought one of those  writings. Just before my hundred and first birthday she sent this article  into the Daily Oklahoman with my picture and there   s quite a write-up  on that.  In that picture you   re holding a baby.  Yes. Did you see it?  I saw it. Who is that baby?  Well, that baby was my first great-great-grandchild. Now I have eight  great-great-grandchildren and two more on the way. This I   m holding is  a little girl. It   s the only like girl. Every one of these others are boys.  (Laughter)  So one girl?  One girl and nine boys.  Oh, my gosh     Yes. (Laughs) Yes.  Well, any advice for someone wishing to live to 100?  Just live a good life and enjoy it.  Well we thank you very much for sharing your story with us today. It   s  been a pleasure.  I   ve sure done a lot of talking. (Laughter)  It   s been great.  -------  -------
