 Finchum  Burke  Today is March 26, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Yukon, Oklahoma, to speak with Bill Burke. This is in regards to our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life Project, so thank you for having us today. Let   s  start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  I was born February 16, 1914, in Warrenton, Virginia.  And were you born at home or in a hospital or what?  I was told that it was in a hospital.  Okay.  According to my mother, she overheard a friend say,    I wouldn   t name a  dog William Henry.    (Laughter)  And did you have brothers and sisters?  I had one sister, older, and I had one brother, younger, but they   re both  gone.  So you were in the middle.  I was in the middle.  And what did your parents do for a living?  My father was in the National Guard, and he had a sergeant   s rating. His  living was he was the police department in Warrenton. Get that: the  police. He was it. (Laughter)  5  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  And how did he make his rounds? By horse?  On foot.  On foot? Talk a little bit about your elementary school. Where did you  go, and how many children were in your class, that type of thing.  Elementary, I went to three schools for my elementary years. We had  been living on a farm in Virginia, and my mother arranged with a  brother of hers who had come back from World War I. He bought a  house in Washington and took us in, along with a couple other brothers  and sisters. I had a late start in school because I was already past  beginning age for school when we moved into the city where we could  go to school. On the farm, we were three miles from town, and it would  be a little difficult to get there. I was in a class in which there was  another William Burke. The teacher had to use our middle names so  we   d know who she was calling on. Then due to   oh, they had me skip  a half a grade because I was old, and that moved me to another school.  Each one, of course, was in walking distance. Then after that, we moved  from the northeast of Washington to the northwest, and so that meant a  third elementary school.  And then into high school?  Went to junior high and still in walking distance, a little farther, and then  from junior high went to McKinley Technical High School back in the  northeast. This required riding a bus and a street car and walking at both  ends.  Did you have a favorite subject in high school?  Yes, anything electrical, mathematical. (Laughs)  What year did you graduate?  I graduated in 1932.  And did you plan to go to college?  I couldn   t plan for college. We didn   t have anything, but I earned a  scholarship to Bliss Electrical School, which was just outside of  Washington. I had a friend who wanted that same scholarship, but he  didn   t get it. He lived back in southeast Washington, but he had a car,  and he would come and pick me up and take me to school and back  home every day.  6  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  But he couldn   t go to class with you?  Oh yes, he   .  He went with you?  We were in class together, yes, but his father could afford for him to go.  Well, from that, when you finished that program, what did you do?  When I graduated from Bliss, IBM was looking for new service  personnel, and they came and took 40 percent of our class, and I was one  of those. Then IBM sent us to Endicott, New York, for school and  repairing machines. I went back to Washington for a few months,  working, then back to Endicott for some more school. Then, much to my  dislike, I was shipped to New York City. I didn   t want to go.    Oh, go for  six months.    I was there for seventeen years.  Did you learn to like it?  I got used to it. Let   s put it that way. While there, I took an evening  course in electronics at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, and life has been  learning as it went along.  Well, IBM, that was in the early days of IBM?  Yes.  So you were on the cutting edge, so to speak.  I guess so. (Laughs)  Pretty exciting times.  This was long before electronics and computers. It was punch-card  accounting systems.  And the 1930s, in the Depression, were you in New York during   that  would   ve been about the right time, wouldn   t it, the   30s? You were in  New York?  Yes, that started in 1929, I guess, wasn   t it? I think.  So it was after that, then. Did you serve in the military any during that  time?  7  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  No, actually I volunteered for the Navy. They told me one eye wasn   t  20/20, if I got lenses and come back they would take me and give me a  warrant officer rating. I delayed going. In fact, I didn   t go  back...eventually, a long time after I did get glasses, when I was called  for the draft right away. I was 20/20 for them, so I was accepted, went  through a medical and so on. Then IBM obtained a deferment for me  both times.  Okay.  Somebody had to stay home and take care of those machines.  Well, where did you live in New York City?  At first my friend and I, with whom I went to school, roomed together,  and when he got married and left, I was by myself a little while. Then I  got married and lived in Queens, New York. Oh, then I had lived in  Manhattan for a while by myself, but when I got married we moved to  New Jersey. I forget the name of the place.  In the late   40s and   50s, somewhere in there? About what time period  was that, when you got married?  Nineteen forty-five. Oh, East Orange. East Orange, that   s it.  Nineteen forty-five, that was during World War II, right in there.  Of course, I was still working in New York City. I had to walk to the  railroad station, an hour on the train, and either take the ferry across and  then walk, or take the Hudson tubes and then walk. If the weather was  good, I took the ferry.  Well, what prompted you to move out into the suburbs like that?  Well, it was hard to find any place in the city, at least that we could  afford     True.     so it was that or nothing, I guess.  Well, how had you met your wife?  Oh, yes. When all the fellows were going into service, IBM began hiring  girls to do service work. I was, at that time, stationed at Metropolitan  8  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Life. In fact, there were twenty-one of us working in there, and she was  put in the Met Life too, so we met at work.  And then you moved to Orange. How long did you stay in New York  then?  I worked there seventeen years, and then we bought a house after a  while in New Jersey. After approximately seventeen years, I went from  servicing machines into design work, so then we moved to Endicott. We  built a house there.  So how long were you with IBM, then, total?  Thirty-eight years and six months or something. (Laughs)  So that   s a pretty impressive record.  My last two years, I moved back to Virginia and took early retirement  because the incentive was too good to pass up. They wanted to get rid of  the old people. While we were living in Virginia then, (of course, we  bought a house there, too) McCulloch Corporation, which was in various  businesses such as chainsaws and helicopters and all kinds of things,  was building Lake Havasu City in Arizona, offering free flights out to  talk you into buying lots, so we signed up for that. These flights went  from Baltimore airport, so we had to drive all the way around the city to  get over there.  It was snowing, and the plane flight originated in Boston. It was  supposed to  pick up people at Rochester  and pick up  more of us at  Baltimore . Came on down almost to Baltimore and had to turn and go  back to Rochester. By the time we got off, we were quite late, and we  couldn   t go all the way to Arizona on account of fuel and food, so we  had to stop midway in Chicago to refuel and get some food for us. Then  we went on to Lake Havasu, bought a lot, went back home, sold the  house real quickly, and moved to Arizona. We had to rent awhile, until  the house was built.  Quite a difference from those two places.  Yes. (Laughs) Then my wife decided she didn   t want an ordinary house  anymore. Some man in California had developed means of heating and  cooling the house controlled by the sun, so with his help we built a  house with, what was it, two tons of water on the roof, something like  that, and sliding insulating panels over them. In winter, you opened the  panels in the daytime to heat the water from the sun and closed it at  night to keep the heat in. In the summer, you reversed it to let the heat  9  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  out at night and keep it out in the daytime.  Did it work pretty well?  It worked, yes. Of course, it wasn   t long until that water on the roof  became kind of stagnant. (Laughs) Then my wife decided it was time for  us to find a continuing care, life care place, so she consulted AARP and  got a list of them. We wanted to get somewhere near our two sons who  were in Texas. We stopped at Spanish Cove first, then went around into  Texas and Arkansas. I think we even touched Missouri, and then we  came back to Spanish Cove and signed up because this was the one for  us. The others all had too much formality and not enough freedom. They  would require you to sit at a certain table, and there was no noise in the  dining room, for instance. There was freedom and lot of chatter and  laughing here, which was good.  So when did you come here, then?  We came here in June, 1994.  Do my math, twenty years?  It was twenty years ago.  Twenty years in June, yes.  Well, did your wife work along the way?  Yes, she had to take care of the children. (Laughs)  And pick out houses with new roofs, huh?  Pick out houses, yes. Actually, she worked in a jewelry store in Lake  Havasu for a while because she had, while living in Arizona, taken up  rock hounding and silversmithing and all that stuff. She made a lot of  silverware, bolas, and I   ve got a belt buckle that she made, silver and  turquoise, the Indian combination.  In Arizona, that makes sense.  Are you still married today?  Yes, my wife is over in assisted living now. She   s been there a year and  half.  And is she a hundred, as well?  10  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  No, she   s ninety-one.  Oh, you married a spring chicken, then.  Yes. (Laughter)  So what   s the secret to a long, happy marriage?     Yes, dear. Yes, dear.    (Laughter)  Well, did you ever imagine that you would live to be a hundred?  Nope, never thought about it.  Well, when you reached ninety-nine, you thought,    Ah, one more year   ?  Well, people kept reminding me. I couldn   t forget that.  What did you do to celebrate?  We had eleven of our relatives come here on Saturday, the fifteenth of  February, and put on a big party and celebration over in our plaza hall,  and then after church on Sunday, had another party at church after the  service. Then at the beginning of the service, the pastor had me up on  the pulpit seated with him as he asked me questions, and I answered,  about my life, activities, and so on. So it was big celebration for two  days.  Well, did he ask you a question that kind of surprised you?  No, there were things I expected because it was about how things have  changed and what you did and where were you, all those.  Well, what do you see as the biggest change that you   ve seen over those  hundred years?  The changes are so great, it   s hard to say. Certainly all the modern  electronics is a big thing. It moves so fast you can   t catch up with it.  Well, did you travel?  We used to travel some. While living in Arizona we took advantage of a  program that Eastern Airlines, which no longer exists   you could go  anywhere you wanted for twenty-one days. No matter where you went,  you had to go through Atlanta. (Laughs) In order to get to Washington  11  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  state and Oregon, we had to go to Atlanta from Arizona, but we had a  good time. In those days, flying was all right, no problems, except that  one time our luggage wound up in Salt Lake City or Minneapolis or  somewhere, and we wanted it in Arizona, but they got it back to us.  And people dressed like they were going to church when they traveled?  Yes. We went to church dressed like you were going to church, too.  That   s true.  Not anymore.  Well, what were some family traditions growing up, like holidays? How  did you celebrate holidays back in Virginia and Washington? Christmas,  July Fourth     Oh, well, for early Christmas, when I was still a kid we had a tree, but  there were no electric lights in those days. We had gas lights, and we  used to clip candles on the tree, but you wouldn   t dare light them. One  Christmas, must have been my uncle, bought some electric lights and  batteries to light the lights. When it was time to do away with the tree,  the batteries were still good, and somebody gave me a little electric  motor. I had more fun with that than anything, and that started me off to  get into anything electrical. I fell in love with that. I guess you  mentioned a dream. A dream I did have was I would be an electrical  engineer someday. I got halfway there, not a full engineer. (Laughs)  Halfway is better than none.  Yes. Oh, we always had a tree.  And what would be the meal? What would your mother fix for your  Christmas day?  Turkey. (Laughs)  Do you remember your first car?  My first car was a worn out, rusted out Plymouth. We were living in  New Jersey then. I did some patching up and some improvements on it.  It served its purpose for a while, and I traded that in on a new Ford. That  rusted out, and traded it in on a Rambler. Then I decided it was time to  get another car. I got another Plymouth, new, and traded that in on a  somewhat-used Ford. After that, I traded that in on a slightly-used  Plymouth, and that was the last one I had. We gave up driving six and a  12  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  half years ago. I have to depend on other people to take me now.  Spanish Cove has a couple of cars. They   ll take you to doctors and  stores and anywhere in Yukon. The doctors, most of them, will be in  Oklahoma City. They go there, and I have a good friend upstairs who   s  anxious to take me to stores. She says    Don   t take the Cove cars. You  waste too much there, sitting and waiting, I   ll take you and bring you  back.    I do that most of the time, and I have a couple who lives nearby  who take me to church most of the time. Once in a while they   re away,  so I find another way to go. So we make out quite well.  What church do you attend?  It   s Bethel Baptist Church.  Baptist.  And growing up as a child, how important was religion in your family?  Well, it was rated quite highly. We hadn   t grown as much as we ought to  at that time, so in the later years I   ve been growing more.  Well, since you   ve moved around so much, if someone asks you,    Where  was home,    where do you consider home?  Where I am. (Laughs)  I was trying to do the math in my head. You were not in New York in  1964 for the World   s Fair?  Yes, we were there for World   s Fair. Let   s see.  I think that was in    64.  In fact, even though we lived right there, IBM put us up in a hotel to go  to the fair because they brought people from all over the country. They  stayed in a hotel, so we stayed in a hotel. (Laughs)  Had to work in the pavilion to answer questions and that sort of thing  for IBM? Were you at the fair to work, or were you at the fair to enjoy  it?  Oh no, just to visit, just to go to the fair, yes.  Okay. I   ll make myself clearer, okay.  13  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Yes. (Laughter)  Do you have any memories from the fair?  Nothing special, no.  Don   t remember the Oklahoma pavilion?  Nope. (Laughs)  It was supposed to be in the shape of the state. That   s about all I know,  and they gave out chicken, fried chicken.  Oh, well, I hadn   t been interested in Oklahoma at that time. (Laughter)  Well, that   s a good answer, I guess. (Laughs)  New York   s known as a sports town. Were you a Yankees fan when you  were living there?  No, I had given up sports, I think, by that time. When I was in  Washington, the Washington Senators, baseball, was my team. I think  somebody even took me to one of the games, if I remember clearly.  And the Great Depression, did that affect you in any way, or do you  recall anything from that period?  I think the only answer I can come up with there is that we didn   t know  any differently than being hard up. We always had food, we always had  a roof over our heads, but nothing extraordinary. Minimal, I guess you   d  say. My mother at one time was working in Washington   s biggest and  finest department store, Woodward and Lothrop, and her job was  repairing dolls. They probably don   t repair them anymore. Throw them  away and buy a new one. She worked with a lady who had three sons.  One of them was kind of crippled, and he worked for the Washington  Star newspaper. She urged and pestered him until he finally gave me a  job as an elevator operator. He was a starter for the elevators. That put  some money in our hands, not much. The effect there was that I was  making eighteen dollars a week, but when the NRA took over, National  Recovery Administration, thirteen fifty was all you could make, see, so  that was a cut in, let   s see   .  So that was before you were married?  Oh yes, yes. I was a teenager.  14  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Teenager.  In fact, I was supposed to be sixteen, but they squeezed me in a little  before I reached sixteen. (Laughter)  Well, how would you get to work, on foot or     Rode a streetcar, a little walk at each end.  NRA, I hadn   t heard that in a long time.  After I was with IBM, the little time I worked in Washington, we had an  unusual snow, and the streetcars couldn   t operate because there was  snow covering the rails. They couldn   t make contact. I walked all the  way downtown then. (Laughs)  Simpler times in some ways.  Yes.  I want to know because you worked for IBM, how did IBM change while  you were there? What were some of the things that you kind of went  through during the time as IBM grew?  What I went through was just keep on working. Oh, Tom Watson Sr.,  who started IBM, (in fact, it wasn   t IBM at first; it was International  Time Recording Company) was a very stern and busy man. Tom Watson  Jr. wanted to get into electronics, and his father said,    No, this is our  thing.    Eventually Junior prevailed, and that   s when they got into  computer work.  I will say for senior Tom, his wife was a very pleasant little lady. We  used to have frequent meetings back in those days, and most of it was     they had people who made up songs praising Thomas J. Watson, and  we   d meet and sing all these songs to him, but his wife was just so nice.  They   d have a receiving line at some of these events, and Senior would  shake your hand and pull you and push you on away to get on, get to the  next one. She   d just stand there and talk so nicely, pleasant grandma.  (Laughs)  Do you remember some of the songs or one of the songs?  Well, I could come up with a few words now and then, but not the whole  song, no. (Laughter) Right now I   d have to work to bring up any.  What sort of things did you do for fun?  15  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Oh, in IBM we actually had a men   s glee club of employees, and we  would dress up in costumes and sing our songs at some of these  meetings. We had fun there. At one time we had a bowling league, too,  and I was in that. One Thanksgiving, I won a turkey. (Laughter) Outside  of IBM, at Radio City Music Hall on Saturday matinee you could go for  a dollar and have a stage show, the Rockettes and a movie and news reel  and all those things. We used to that now and then.  For a dollar, that   s pretty good, too.  Well, a dollar in those days, it was quite a lot.  Fast-forwarding to today, what   s a typical day like for you? What time  do you wake up, and what time do you go to bed? What   s a typical day?  What do you do during the day?  Oh, now, you mean?  Yes.  Oh. (Laughs) Well, generally I crawl out around six thirty, occasionally  sleep until seven. Sometimes I get up at five and do laundry. Always  have straightening up and making the bed, such things. On Monday  mornings, we have Spanish Cove Singers practice. I   m in that. Tuesday  morning we have a devotion period with the administrator. Friday  morning there   s kaffeeklatsch. Usually we don   t have anything  scheduled on Saturday. One of the exercise classes is Stretch and  Strengthen which I do Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons.  Yesterday, for instance, (it   s generally the last Tuesday of the month)  there   s a residents meeting, which I   ve been taking care of the audio  equipment and moving chairs. Recently, well, within the past year, a  younger man has sort of taken over the audio. In fact, he   s into video,  too. I don   t get in video. He   s also helped me move chairs. Then  Tuesday evening, we have the board of trustees after the residents  meeting. Every two months, there   s a potluck supper. I go to that  sometimes.  What do you take?  I don   t take anything except contribute to buying Colonel Sanders  chicken. (Laughter)  That works.  Everything is contributed except the chicken.  16  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  I was just curious if you cooked.  I can fry eggs. (Laughter)  That counts.  I bake bread in the machine. (Laughter)  What time do you usually go to bed on a typical day?  Generally around ten. That   s my aim. Sometimes it   s a little early,  occasionally a little later.  Do you do much reading?  Yep, I read. I   m a fairly good patron of our library. I don   t go to the  public library. That requires transportation, and then you have to take the  books back by a schedule. Here, our library is on an honor system. You  just go and pick out what you want and take it back, and a volunteer  librarian reshelves it. That   s quite convenient.  And do you have a particular type of fiction, non-fiction type of book or  type of things that you like to read?  Yes, the primary one is Westerns with Louis L   Amour and Zane Grey.  Every now and then I pick a mystery novel. I don   t do much for non-fiction.  I do it for entertainment.  And how do you keep up with current events?  Mostly from the newspaper. A little bit from the TV, but there   s too  much crime, crime, crime. That   s all you see on TV. I usually watch the  news around five thirty and six.  You mentioned you sing. Do you have a favorite song, or what are you  practicing these days?  Well, we   re doing some Rodgers and Hart for the next time. There   s  most always one religious number, and three or four times a year we  give a concert here. We do it once over in the pavilion where the assisted  living and nursing areas. We practice on them, then do it for the  independent residents. (Laughs)  Would you mind singing something for us, just a little something?  17  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Finchum  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Yes, I   d mind. (Laughs)  Okay, shucks. I was hoping you   d go into    You Are My Sunshine    or  something.  (Pretending to be hoarse) My voice don   t work. (Laughter)  All right, we   ll let you pass on that, then.  Now, you said you had children. Is that right?  Yes.  What was it like to be father, and how often do you see them today or see  even     Well, being a father has been fun. I think you   d class it as a normal  situation. Today, we see the two boys from Texas, oh, maybe two or  three months. My daughter   s in New Jersey, so that may be three or four  years.  Do you have grandchildren?  Yes.  Any great-grandchildren?  Yes, in Florida. One of them was here for the birthday, one grandson  and one great   no. One son and the grandson were here.  Being a hundred years of age, do you have any secrets to your  longevity? What has contributed to your long life, do you think?  That   s a big question. (Laughter)  You   ve got to have a secret, right?  I want to be a little funny and say when I was young, living in New  York, I ate a lot of chocolate.  Well, there is a connection.  I   ve eaten a lot of chocolate since then, too, but I   ve had to go easy on  that now because a doctor found out I   m a pre-diabetic, so I   m supposed  to watch the sugar.  18  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Finchum  Burke  Bishop  So chocolate   s your secret?  Yes, but it has to be dark chocolate.  Dark chocolate.  I don   t really like milk chocolate much. The darker the better.  Other than that, though, do you have any other idea what might have  contributed to living longer?  Every now and then I think about that because people ask, like you are,  and I say,    Well, God puts us here for some purpose that he wants us to  accomplish, and I guess I haven   t accomplished mine yet. That   s on  God   s timetable.     And do you have a philosophy you live by? Do you have kind of a motto  for life?  Well, went back to that one day at a time.  One day at a time.  Anything on your to-do list you haven   t done yet but you would like to?  I would say that that   s kind of faded. For a long time, it was I would like  to go to New Zealand, but I   m not interested anymore because I  wouldn   t be able to enjoy it. In fact, I wouldn   t even want to travel. I   ve  been on some trips here at Spanish Cove. We have our own tour bus,  and the activities girls are always making plans to go here and there.  One thing I enjoyed quite a lot with that was when we went to the  Millers    Amish Farm for lunch, and then one time to the Azalea Festival  and the art museum. There   s kind of the highlights.  They have mystery trips frequently. I have tried those, but I decided I  wanted to know where I was going first (Laughter) because a couple  times where they went, I didn   t really appreciate. The Spanish Cove  Singers every year is treated to a luncheon in appreciation for our  contribution. I guess it was last year my Superman shirt was given to me  because they always gave us something at these luncheons, so I have to  wear it now and then.  Now, you said you do a lot of different moving chairs and setting things  up. Are you known as one of the persons around here that does a lot of  the fixing of things? Are you like Mr. Fix It?  19  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Bishop  Burke  Finchum  Burke  Yep, I   m Mr. Fix It. Fix things for the Cove, and fix things for other  residents. Yesterday I just had a new request for Mr. Fix It. Over in the  therapy room, one of their machines is an arm exerciser which is falling  apart, so I   ve promised to go see what I can do with fixing that up. I  think I can.  Now, when history is said and done, what do you want it to say about  you?  I   m a minor part of it. (Laughter)  What do you want others to remember you for, or how do you want to be  remembered?  As being a good guy, well, being pleasant, being helpful. I don   t look for  stardom or anything like that. I   m in the background.  Well, that was our final question. Is there something you want to tell us  before we sign off, anything we haven   t asked that you would like to get  on the recording?  With all the questions you   ve asked? (Laughter)  There can   t possibly be more.  I may think of something after you   re gone. (Laughter)  All right, well, we sure appreciate your time. It   s been a pleasure.  Well, you   re welcome. I   m enjoying it.  -------  -------
