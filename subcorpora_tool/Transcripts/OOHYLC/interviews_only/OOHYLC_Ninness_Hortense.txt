 Finchum  Ninness  Today is March the 7th, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in  Chandler, Oklahoma to speak with Hortense Ninness.  Ninness.  Ninness, in regards to our 100 Year Life project. So thank you for  talking with us today.  Thank you.  Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  I was born on a farm south of Stroud, right where I used to live before I  came over here.  And when?  Oh, 1912, July the 23rd. That   s a long time ago.  And were you born at home?  Yes sir. All of us babies was born at home. They had babies at home in  those days.  And how many brothers and sisters did you have?  Whoa me. Oh, I had one brother that died. He must have been about  nine, maybe? I don   t remember him, but my sister said she does. Oh, my  sister   s got a memory that doesn   t let up. But anyway, I don   t remember  stuff. I don   t hardly keep track of anything if I don   t need it.  5  Finchum  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Well, where did you go to school?  I went to school in a country school. I had to walk half a mile. Oh, I  never will forget that. My brothers and sisters and everybody was all  big, you know, and me was a little tiny tot, first year at school, and John  Eichenberg, a half a mile north and quarter east, first house.    Kiss  Johnny goodbye Hortense     I kissed my first boyfriend then. (Laughter)  How old were you?  I don   t know. I just started school. (Laughter) Probably six, maybe five.  I don   t know, three or four, something. I don   t know what I was, have no  idea. That was fun.  Was it a one-room school?  Yep. Well, yes it was a one-room school, but our country school a half a  mile north of me, a mile north of the schoolhouse and a mile east was a  two-room schoolhouse, and another mile north, a two-room  schoolhouse. It had a partition across it and everything. You could  divide it up. We always had our pie suppers and everything over there.  Do you know what a pie supper is like?  Why don   t you tell us?  Oh god, that   s fun. You work for a week or two weeks making a box,  decorating that box for the pie supper. Then the girls got their husbands,  their boyfriends, whoever was going to eat with them. They knew who  was going to buy their box. Anyway, they   d put sandwiches, and they  got to putting everything, a whole supper in that box. And they brought  that box up there and the auctioneer (we had a young man that lived on a  hill north of me about mile north of us), and he was a good auctioneer.  The youngest boy, he was a good auctioneer, had a loud voice. He   d  climb up there and haul that box up there and you know, sold them. You  bid it. If you had a dime, you bid for it, and you worked hard for that  money, you know. You   d pick cotton and you chopped and you saved  them nickels and dimes until that fall came, and then you knew you was  going to go to the pie supper and buy your girlfriend   s box, if your  friend didn   t buy it ahead of you. He could bid a nickel higher and he  got the box, and you had to eat with that old ugly girl over there in the  corner somewhere.  Oh boy  (Laughs) It was fun. It was lots of fun. I was real little when I  went to my first pie supper. I can   t even remember. Of course, we  always had a pie supper, but I remember when I met my first boyfriend  6  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  down there.  I bet you do.  We were out in the yard playing. The kids always went out in the yard  and played until time to go inside. We were outside playing, and I  wanted this ring to be bigger and bigger and bigger. So there stood that  old boy over there, and I went over there and grabbed him and pulled  him in the ring to make the ring bigger, because the bigger the ring was,  the further the kids had to run on the outside to drop a handkerchief  behind a boy or a girl. Then after you drop that handkerchief behind the  boy or girl, they had to run and you got to take their place. Anyway this  old boy was standing over there by himself, and I thought,    Well he   d  make the ring bigger.    That   s all I was interested in, was making the ring  bigger. He thought I was after him. Oh god. (Laughter)  I used to go with that guy. I remember he never forgot that either. He did  not forgive me for coming out there and getting him, bringing him in the  ring to make the ring bigger. I said,    Well I just wanted you in the ring  to make the ring bigger around,    so the kids would have further around  to run, of course. Oh, shoot. That old boy was my boyfriend from then  on. (Laughs) He thought he was anyway. He married some other girl,  went off to Kansas City with her folks, came back to Stroud, Oklahoma  a single man. Then he went to Florida to his oldest daughter, and he died  there and was buried in Florida. I have no idea of where, what town or  anything about it.  Well, where did you go to high school?  Stroud.  Stroud.  Well, Stroud and Davenport were the only two schools, and if you didn   t  go to that, you had to go to Prague. Prague was a long ways south of us,  and so we went to Stroud. I went to Stroud High School.  Do you remember what year you graduated?  Nineteen-twelve. Oh god no. That was the year I was born. (Laughter)  Oh, graduated when I was born  Oh boy, that   s getting along pretty good  ain   t it?  Was it like 1930, maybe?  Thirty-one. I got married in    30.  7  Finchum  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  You got married in    30.  Did you finish high school?  No.  No.  No, why did I need an education? I don   t need to education to talk to  you. Shoot no. He   s just an old guy sitting over there, and I   m just a  blabbing away. He   s listened to every bit of it, though. He thinks he  does. He won   t know half of what I said when he gets home. Whoo   (Laughter) Really. I can see him just a laughing.  So you got married in 1930, during the depression?  Thirty-one. I was married and we had a baby by then. Oh, my uncle  came to stay. I went to Seminole. My husband came from Illinois, and  he came from Illinois in, when was it, 1930 I guess, because I got  married in    31, and so he came from Illinois. Oh, his cousin up on the  hill, he lived up on the hill, Chapman, and he was half a mile north. See,  Stroud came down this corner and with this corner, and over here was  the rivers. Two rivers run across clear from here to I don   t know where,  to the road that   s going across the highway over there now. Well,  anyway, he came and he, I forgot what I was starting to tell. Oh, it must  have been a lie.  His cousin, your husband   s cousin?  Yeah, how I met my husband. This cousin, I was going with him  occasionally. He was just a friend. I didn   t go with anybody. I didn   t go  with anyone. I was just friends with everybody. I   m always friendly to  everybody. Anyway, I was a friend to everybody, and he was just a  friend. See, they lived a mile and a half north of us, maybe a mile  altogether.  Anyway, he lived up on the hill up there, and I lived down here by the  river. I   ll get it straight here in a minute. I was going with this boy on the  hill, kind of, kind of, not really going with him. He was just a friend of  the family, and he was the son of a family friend. You know, if you   re  neighbors with someone your whole life and the kids all grow up  together, they   ve got to be friends. Couldn   t be anything else but a  friend. So anyway, he lived a mile and a half north of us, and I went with  him just occasionally, because his mother and my grandmother knew  each other when they were young people, pioneers here in the country.  8  Finchum  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  See we came from Creek County.  I took care of my grandmother until I was thirteen. She died when I was  thirteen. She passed away, I can   t remember, but I know where she   s  been buried and everything, because I asked one day to see. It happened  when I was about thirteen, and I took care of her all my life. Momma  used to take care of the garden and can. God, we canned hundreds of  quarts. Had a big nice cellar. Daddy built a cellar, and we put all that  stuff in fruit jars down in the cellar. I   m getting kind of off my story, but  it doesn   t matter as long as it all ties together. Anyway, this boyfriend  lived up there on that hill, and my grandmother knew his mother real  well, and my grandma said   well, let me get back to what I   m thinking.  You get old, you   re 103, god almighty. Whoo  One hundred and three, I  can   t believe it. Can you?  I cannot, no.  No, you don   t either. I like your hair. I think it   s so pretty. I like it, I  think it   s pretty. I don   t like this old boy though. (Laughter)  Well, how did you meet     I   d bet he   d get me for saying that.  How did you meet your husband?  Well, that   s what I   m getting ready to tell you now.  Oh, okay.  Our two grandmothers knew each other, and I got acquainted with that  grandmother up there, which was the mother of a boyfriend. I pulled him  in the ring, you know, that day at school, at Oak Grove School. District  A was our district. It was a district a mile north and a mile east, and a  half a mile or a mile north that way to the schoolhouse   my shoulder  cramps every once in a while   and anyway, our grandmothers knew  each other, pioneer people, way back. God, I don   t know when, long  time before I was born. Anyway, they were pioneers, my grandmother  and his mother were pioneers and they lived here and they knew each  other. I want you to know that everybody died and everybody has gone.  I was in high school and I showed them I guess. I was driving the car  back and forth that Daddy bought us. By then my car was a bus. I drove  everybody to school. Everybody in the neighborhood rode with me to  school, and I thought the other night, my car was a pre-bus. It was a  coupe, a nice enclosed car. Daddy went to, I believe his name was  9  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Fouquet, the Chevrolet garage in Stroud up on the east end of town, and  that   s where he bought my car. I had the prettiest new car, and this  cousin that I went with a time or two, this son of a lady that my  grandmother knew, well, when he went by   now all of his people had  died. Everybody died.  He finally lost his two brothers, and his daddy came from Illinois where  my husband   s people are from, he came from Illinois, and he was a  jewelry man. He could make jewelry. He made a tie-clasp, and that tie-clasp  was real particular for this boy that I went with, his son. Yeah, his  son, I went with him, dated him, might say. I don   t know, anyway we  were friends, and   you   re a good-looking guy. (Laughter) I don   t know  why you brought such a good-looking guy with you. Yeah, you should  have brought an ugly old bitch of some kind for me to look at, instead of  a good-looking guy. See, I still like them, oh boy  Oh boy, do I ever like  men.  Okay, after you got married did you live on the farm?  No.  No?  Oil field.  Oil field, okay.  I met this boy and he, went back. I was going with that neighbor boy a  time or two. All his people died and his brother died, so it was just the  two of them left. His brother died so it just left him, and so he went back  to Illinois, see? Where me and my people   s all from, not me, but my  husband   s people are all from Illinois, and Algonquin, Illinois, half way  across the state.  What I thought was these people came from New York or somewhere,  foreign country to America, because America was just being settled, you  know. They all came from foreign countries and they landed on the east  coast, and then they came across the country to wherever they were.  Anyway, they came across and this boy, I   m getting ahead of myself and  a whole bunch of junk all mixed up together, because this good-looking  guy setting there reading. I shouldn   t have him sitting over there.  Anyway, our two grandmothers were pioneers when they came here  from New York or wherever they came from. Winfield, Kansas is where  one grandmother was from. I took care of them until I was thirteen, and  then they died. We settled in between Davenport and Chandler. There  10  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Bishop  Ninness  was a little community down there called, oh god, Leemathis, Leematis  community...  Was is Clematis?  Clematis?  Clematis?  Clematis, Clematis that   s it  Clematis, that   s where all the country  people went to when this country was opened up for settlement here.  Clematis was a very   see the trains weren   t going yet then. Daddy   s  brother was twenty years older than he, and he was a foreman on the  railroad. He set from Oklahoma City to Tulsa, I guess. I   ve been  wondering since I   ve been thinking a lot about it, where he was foreman  on the railroad that put that railroad through. My daddy   s oldest brother,  twenty years older than he was, and he helped lay the railroad, the Frisco  going from Oklahoma City to Tulsa. Frisco isn   t it?  I don   t know.  I think that   s the name of the railroad. Anyway, he laid that railroad. He  was a foreman on the railroad, and he lost one brother there. I thought  poor Grandma. She had a lot of heartaches in her lifetime. We all do I  guess. (Cries)  We all do.  What was life like on the oil field? What did you do on the oil field?  I married a man that came from Illinois here. This boy I was talking  about, all his people died so he said,    I   m going to go back to Illinois  and see where my mother   s people came from.    He wanted to go visit  his mother   s people, and when he did, he brought this boy back with him  that was my husband. He came back with him. He said,    You might as  well come back with me and go to the oil field and go to work at  Seminole.    In 1912 was when Seminole opened up, and Drumright  opened up, 1912, and that was year I was born. He said,    You might as  well come and go back with me and go to work in the oil field.    So  that   s how I met him.  That   s how I met my husband, and so he came back with him, and then  my husband drove a little, oh god, that car was a little old roadster thing.  Canvas windows, that you   d button up with a   he knows what they are.  So my husband drove. Oh, when they got to Miami, Oklahoma, this  cousin picked up a newspaper. He was reading and he said,    Oh, we   re  11  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  in the worst storm we   ve ever had in Oklahoma,    and winter was setting  in. He said,    We better keep driving.    They were in Miami, Oklahoma  when he read that newspaper and he said,    We better keep driving,  because we   re in for the worst storm Oklahoma   s ever had.    So they  drove and they drove and they drove. My husband said he bought  candles at a drugstore, wherever he could get them, little four-inch  candles. He set them all along the windshield of the car and lit them, and  they had a little light, warm, and they kept that snow and ice off the  windshield. He drove from Stroud with them things burning on the car,  and then you went a mile this way and a mile that way, and a mile this  way and mile that way.  Fred Stephens was our mailman, and they lived on one of those corners.  You come on another corner and you come down. My daddy said they  built this big white pyramid, it   s a mile east of the river, and he said,     We put a hole up there for the electricity.    When the electricity came in  they were going to   my daddy paid thirty-five dollars for the farm. That  little guy come by and he said,    I   m collecting money for the farm,    and  I said,    My daddy   s already paid for this farm. I ain   t giving you no  money.    I didn   t give him any either. He went on his way.  Well anyway, this here little old white pyramid thing is still out there,  you need to go look at it. You would enjoy that. You might even take a  picture of it, who knows. A big tall white thing, and it   s called a  pyramid, but it   s not. It   s square all the way around, square, and it   s in  the center of the road. The road comes from Stroud and down a mile  south, comes a mile west, and it crosses the river. Well, if you go on  another mile and two miles you   ll be at my house. So see, that was at  the, I don   t know what you   d call it, three corner. Anyway, that   s where  the pyramid is, and it   s still out there. Big, tall thing, like that thing.  So do you remember the Great Depression?  God almighty.  What were times like then?  Huh?  What was the Great Depression like for you?  I don   t know if I want to talk about it or not. (Laughs) Oh boy, the  Depression.  Tough times?  12  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  That   s when I got married, see.  Yeah.  Oh, they said,    What   d you get married in the Depression for?    I said,     Because I was in love.    When you   re in love, you get married. You  don   t give a damn what   s going on, do you?  No.  No.  No you don   t, that   s right. Little boy, if you   re not married you better  look out around here. I   ve got a bunch of single girls, too, that takes care  of me. I   m going to sic them on you. (Laughter) Wouldn   t that be  something?  So you and your husband, you kind of started out in tough times, would  you say?  I was going with this boy on the hill, my neighborhood boy, because I  was acquainted with him, and our grandmothers knew each other and all  of that, pioneer people. I was going with him and all his family died. He  and his brother were living. His daddy was a jewelry maker from  Illinois, where my husband   s people all live. Anyway, he was a jewelry  maker, and he came to Oklahoma, and what he did, he bought that farm  out there. I guess he probably, I thought the other day, he probably took  that in on a debt, don   t you imagine?  He could have, yes.  On that farm     That   s what they did back then.  Pioneering. He probably took that farm in on a debt, and I remember  him. He lost his momma, daddy and everybody, and then his brother  died. There was nobody left but him so he said,    I   m going to go back to  Illinois where my momma   s people came from and see what her people  are like.    And when he did, he brought my husband back with him. So  that   s how I met my husband.  Did you ever have any children?  God, I got too many kids. (Laughs) You have too many kids. I had four  altogether, and I still have two. Two boys. Romeyn, he was supposed to  13  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  come today over here, but he didn   t make it I guess or else he don   t  know where to go. You suppose he   d be out there now?  They   ll bring him down here.  They   d bring him in?  Yeah.  Okay.  So you have four children?  Yes.  Two boys, two girls?  One girl, I lost her when she was one year old. Oh, that was horrible. We  lived on a farm. Now, you talk about getting married, I got married in     31, 1931 because my husband had come from Illinois in this car, and I  married him. He said,    I   m going to marry that girl.    It was cute.  (Laughs) This cousin of his at that farm, the two farms that were a mile  and a half apart, two miles. His farm was up on the hill and ours was  down close to the river.  Anyway, you homesteaded them farms, you know. I said,    Grandma,  where did they go to run for this farm?    She said,    Over to Creek  County.    We went over to Creek County which is the county east of us.  Creek was east, then Potawatomie is south, you know, Shawnee.  Anyway, and Lincoln is this one. Creek and Lincoln and Potawatomie,  those are the ones I know. Anyway, she said they went over to Creek  County to run and when the gun went off, everybody would run to stake  the claim. Then they went to Chandler and filed it, you know. We had  one family trying to get that farm away from us when I was a kid. I don   t  know anything about it. When my grandmother was little, I guess. I  don   t know. Anyway, they tried to get that farm, because they said they  was the one that staked the claim first, you know. That went on a lot  those days.  They did.  So you lost one child, and that was when you first got married?  Thirty-one.  Thirty-one.  14  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Yep, she was our little girl, only one we had. We had a little girl. Oh  yeah, my second baby was a girl and I lost her, and that was during the  depression time. Oh, it was terrible. Horrible, horrible time, and     How did you lose her?  She just got pneumonia.  Pneumonia.  You won   t believe this, but it rained in July, a cold, cold rain. We built a  fire in the house and the men wore blanket-lined jackets to keep warm.  In July.  In July. It rained. It was cold, cold, cold. That   s when she died. She took  pneumonia and died of pneumonia.  How old was she?  One year old.  One.  Yeah, one year old. I remember during that time, now this summer. My  daddy built a good cellar, it   s still there. Momma had her stuff in the  front. My brother lived in a house down on the farm, of course, and I  had the rent house. He lived in the little new house that was built straight  back west. My brother had his food in there, and my food was in the  back of the cellar, down on the floor. My husband went back there and  he struck a match. He said,    God, when I say that light go from that  match to that floor, I knew what was going to happen.    He said,    I put  my hands over my eyes, and I held my breath and shut my eyes and  covered up my face.    He   d had a lesson in the oil fields on what to do.  He said,    We had this lesson just two or three days ago,    about what to  do if they had an accident. He said he knew exactly what he was  supposed to do. Had that one glove off, he   d struck a match with it, and  he had the other glove in his hand.  He had a jumper on, and he had a hole tore up here. (Gestures) Do you  know that jumper is still there and that hole is still there  I never have  patched it. I was thinking about that the other day. That ragged hole, it   s  still there. Anyway, my husband went to the back of that room, cellar,  and he struck that match, and that little fire went down, and he covered  up his face and his hands and his gloves. He said when that gas went up  15  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  to the door, see it went    boom   .  We had an old man that came from Nebraska, he left home. That old  man left home, and we never did know where he came from. He  wouldn   t tell anybody. He wouldn   t talk, he wouldn   t say a word.  Wouldn   t tell you his name or anything, and he came there. I guess when  they, bums, was going down the highway, if they saw a windmill, they  knew they could get water. Then he came up that road. It   s a long ways  up to our house, up the road, up the hill, because we lived on top of the  hill, and the river   s south of us. This old man was going down the  highway.  It  went down in front of our house, main highway then, and  this old man came up there. Momma was cooking dinner, and we   d all  eaten dinner and left. Dinner was outside, but it was still on the table.  Momma hadn   t put it up, she was washing dishes, and this old man came  in. He said he kind of liked it there. My daddy came in, and he said,     You looking for a job? I   m going to need some help.    And he said,     You can go to working.    That old man lived with us until he died.  Eighty-some years, he lived with us. He   s buried over in Creek County.  And what was his name?  Sebastian Hallgarth. Sebastian Hallgarth. We   d finally found out.  Momma would have a way of asking questions, and she would ask you  something after a while. She   d be washing dishes, she   d finally ask  something. You answered, and when you answered her, she   d put it all  together. She   d finally figure it out, and this old man had left Nebraska.  Now he had walked all that day, all that distance he had walked, because  the highways were good in those days. Dirt highway, a road-grater  grated the road, it was dirt, and they grated the road and he had a good  road to walk on. He came in front of our house. The road came down in  front of our house and Stroud to go into Seminole, Prague, and then  Seminole. It went from our house and crossed the river bridge. ? Terrell?  told me the other day, she said,    Hortense, I got a picture of my girls on  top of that bridge.    Now it   s underwater, you can   t even see it. That  bridge is underwater. The river is closing all up, you know. Everything   s  gone down.  Do you remember the World War II, the war days?  World War II.  Was your husband in World War II, or     Huh?  Was your husband ever in World War II?  16  Ninness  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  God no, he married. I married this oil field man. When he came from  Illinois here with that cousin he said,    You can come and go home with  me, and we can      is somebody at the door? (Knocking) Come in, come  in.  What was it you asked me?  Well, if you ever remember the war days in World War II.  Let me get my breath and start in again. (Laughs) Oh, dear me. I love  that arrangement behind you. You ought to look at it and see. They are  pretty, sitting there by that light, and they got all that sugar, artificial  sugar in them angels.  So what are some of the things you enjoy doing today?  What are the what?  What do you enjoy doing today? What kind of hobbies do you do?  We don   t have a damn thing around here to do.  But I understand you sew?  I do sew.  Where did you learn to sew?  I   ve sewed all my life. Momma made all our clothes. We made all of our  clothes.  Did you learn to sew from your mom?  When I was a little bitty girl, push a petal. Sew, sew, sew, sew. I can   t  remember when I didn   t sew. I can   t remember, and then I sewed for a  living when I went to the oil field. I sewed for a living. I   d sew people   s  clothes. I sold dresses a dollar a dress, women   s dresses for a dollar.  Fifty cents for a little girl   s outfit; bonnet, pair of rufflely britches, and a  cute little dress. One of our sort of boss or something, she had a little  girl, and she would cut out   the Tulsa Tribune had a two-column  picture of a little girl, and that man drew the cutest dresses on that little  girl you ever looked at, and she   d cut them out and bring them over.  She   d say,    Hortense, I got another picture. Do you think you could  make a dress like this?    She   d go buy that dotted swiss, and instead of  using the dot side, she turned it wrong side out, used the wrong side. I  17  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  had to make that dress off of the wrong side of that material. Anyway, I  made her a little dress, and her momma a pair of pants, fifty cents. Can  you imagine?  I can   t imagine.  And you   d have a dress for a dollar. I made you a dress for a dollar.  Where would you get your fabric?  I didn   t buy fabric. They bought it, and I kept all the scraps that was left.  I said,    Everything that   s left over, I get to keep,    because I made quilts.  I   ve made lots of quilts. I learned how to make quilts when I was a little  bitty girl. Talk about sewing, I sewed, made quilts from scraps. Momma  let us, my sister and I, Momma would let us sew if we wanted to sew it.  I don   t care what it was, we cut it up and sewed it when we was little  bitty. Little, tiny, tiny, tiny tots, we cut and sewed, cut and sewed. Can  you imagine the floor, all dirty with quilt scraps? Little kids cutting up  paper and making doll clothes and stuff.  When I went to Davenport, I was down and sick, like I am now, and I  was staying at my son   s house in Davenport. He had a little  granddaughter. I said,    Let her make her a doll dress if she wants to  make it  She can cut it up and make it right there in the floor     My bed  was in that bedroom, and I didn   t care if they cut it and made it a mess.  Shoot, you can always sweep up a mess, can   t you? Sure you can. She   d  cut and make her a doll dress. Of course, she don   t sew now, but she  could if she wanted to because she knows how, because I taught her how  when she was little bitty.  There you go.  So she knows how to make a dress if she wanted to. What do you want  to know next?  Did you ever think you   d live to 100?  Oh, god no. I told a little girl, I said,    I can   t believe it. I don   t believe it,  I don   t believe it     I may be 100, I don   t know. I don   t know.  What   s your secret?  (Laughs) Be happy, I guess it would be. Be happy. I   m always happy. I  don   t care what goes on, it   s not going to worry me. I don   t worry about  anything. I   ve got a new boyfriend. I   m going to see if he   ll like me. I  don   t know. I want to get me a new man. Better looking than him.  18  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  (Laughs) Oh boy, she   s going to tease you now, all the way back to  Stillwater. Oh, dear me.  Do you have a philosophy you live by?  Always be happy. Don   t ever let nothing get you down. Don   t ever let  anything bother you. Always be happy. Happy-go-lucky, that   s all I  know. Happy-go-lucky.  How do you pass your time today?  I wish I had something to do.  Do you read or watch TV or what?  I read but my eyes are getting bad now, and I   ve got to get some new  glasses. She took me down here to get glasses but I can   t see out of  them. I looked through a bunch of wires hanging down like this, a test.  Shit, you can   t get a test like that. You can   t get an eye test like that.  You don   t get anything good. Anyway, here I sit. Can   t read, can   t see,  can   t do it. I got glasses but I don   t wear them. I never did wear glasses.  I   ve had glasses since I   ve been in high school but I don   t wear them. I  don   t like glasses. I don   t want them on. I don   t want them on me.  About how early in the morning do you get up? How early?  I don   t get up. I   ll just sleep all day long. I   d sleep all day long if they   d  let me. I would never get up, I   d just sleep and sleep and sleep. And  enjoy life, sitting there thinking about, oh, I don   t know what I   d think  about.  Well, your husband was 100 when he passed away. What was the secret  to a long and happy marriage?  Just be good and like each other. Love each other every night. Oh boy,  do I miss that. Man, oh man, oh man. You better get out of here fast.  You better take him and take him home. (Laughs)  What do you miss?  What do I miss? What am I missing? Nothing? (Laughs)  In terms of your marriage. You were married a long time.  Sure I was  One hundred years is a long time to stay married. Oh boy,  our house burned up. Where did I go to? I went to my son   s house.  19  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Your house burned up? How long ago was that?  I was in the hospital in Tulsa. I was in the hospital, and lightning at  night, midnight. Oh, I laid there and I looked out that window up at  Tulsa, and I thought,    God, if it burns up my one house,    I had two or  three. I said,    I   ll move in the other one. I   ll just go back in that old brick  house,    that the government built, from the Indian Agency. Moses  Keokuk lived in that house when we built it.  When I went to Virginia to see my son he said,    Momma, if you   ll buy a  train ticket, half of it, come down here, I   ll take you home because I   m  going to be transferred to Colorado, and I can bring you by. I   m going to  stay a while, two or three weeks, and then I   ll go on to Colorado,    so I  did that.  I said to my husband when I went to work, I said,    Honey, I think I   m  going to work and I   ll get a paycheck. What am I supposed to do with  that durn check?    I didn   t know what to do with it. He said,    By God,  you ain   t putting it in my bank. You   ll spend all your money and mine,  too.    I thought you old son-of-a-bitch, I can write a check as good as  you can, so I just went and got it on my own. I went to Stroud and I got  me a bank account, and I   ve still got it, still. His is in Chandler, mine   s  at Stroud.  Sounds like he learned not to mess with you.  That   s right. You don   t mess with me. He knows that now. You don   t  mess with me, I   m an independent woman.  Moses Keokuk, what tribe was he with?  Huh?  Keokuk, Moses Keokuk was a Sac and Fox.  Was a what?  Was he a Sac and Fox Nation?  Yeah, yeah. Sure, that   s what we   re in. We   re in the Sac and Fox. Is that  what you are?  No. There   s a town called Keokuk, Iowa.  Oh, yeah. Keokuk, Iowa. I guess they came from there, down here. You  20  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  suppose?  Maybe, yeah.  Maybe so, I don   t know where they came from, but anyway, I   m   a  mile and a half south, and two miles east is a Keokuk Agency. The  agency is on Highway 99 as you go south from Stroud, straight south,  four miles, and you come to the agency. Then I lived two miles east, two  miles, which way do I live, west. Two miles west and a half north is  where my farm is. Our farm had come from Creek County over, and we  homesteaded it in the Run,    89.  It   s over 100 years old, too, the farm.  What?  The farm is over 100 years old, too.  It is, yeah. Over what?  Over 100.  Yeah, over 100. I thought she said two. I was going to say something   s  wrong with you. (Laughter)  Not yet.  I love your hair. I think it   s so pretty. I think it   s so pretty.  Well, I want to know when history is written, what do you want it to say  about you?  Oh, I   m a good looking little gal, ready for a new man. You can say it. I  don   t care what you say about me. I don   t give a hoot what you say.  Well, what do you want to be remembered for? How do you want others  to remember you?  I   m just a good little girl like everybody else is, supposed to be good.  (Laughs) Supposed to be good and don   t. What do you want to say about  me? He don   t know what he wants to say about me.  How important was religion in your family, church?  We did not go to church, and we had a neighbor across the road,  Preacher Howard. He was our neighbor, he lived there all of his life. He  21  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  had a boy and a girl that was crippled. The boy, he didn   t move or  anything, he   d just lay down on the floor, but the girl could climb up in a  chair. He had them two, and anyway, they lived there. I wondered why  they lived there so long. The farm east of us, they lived on it. I figure  somebody in town owned that farm and must be related to her family,  and when she died, they moved. And when she died, they moved to  Davenport, and there was a family that took them in, let them live. Then  Mr. Howard came here with that girl. She was here for a while, because  I came and visited them one day.  And he was a preacher?  Yeah, he was a Baptist preacher from Arkansas, if that means anything  to you.  But you didn   t go to his church?  Well, we didn   t go to church. Dammit to hell, you live ten miles out in  the country. God, who   s going to walk that far? Nobody.  It was far away?  Seven miles is what we lived, out in the country.  But you went later? After you got married you went to church?  I   d come to Davenport, I drove my own car. I bought me a car and I  drove it. I bought a second hand car, and I drove it until I came over  here. Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet. My son had one, brand new, and I  liked it and this one came up for sale and I thought,    I   ll just go buy that  one,    because it was an Impala like my son had. He had a cute little car.  Mine was a big old car, roadster. Big old touring car with two seats in it,  and I drove it everywhere. I drove it until I came over here. My son  brought me over here. I said,    Hell, I   ll go,    so here I am. I shouldn   t be.  I shouldn   t be here, but I am. I don   t know where I   d go if I didn   t, do  you?  Nope. Sounds like your son takes good care of you.  Yeah, Romeyn does. He does a good job, and then the other one lives  too far away. He lives clear up the Kansas line, and then east. He lives in  Enid, and that   s a long ways from here.  That   s a little way from here.  Yeah, that   s a long ways from here. Enid is a long way, so he doesn   t get  22  Bishop  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  to come see me very often.  And you said your son   s name is Romeyn?  Romeyn, the one that took a whole week to get named. I promise, and  you know what? My husband worked for a man called Romeyn Ford,  Romeyn Ford, and we went to see him. He lives clear up about a mile or  two from Chicago, and we went the last time we was in Colorado. Carmi  is where my husband   s people live, halfway across the state of Illinois,  and straight north and over to Carmi. Over to, what did I say the name of  that thing was?  Romeyn Motors?  He doesn   t even know what I said. He doesn   t even know what I said.  Well, how did you celebrate when you turned 100? What was your  birthday celebration like?  I should show you. My niece in Davenport, she lives four miles west of  here, and she made me a picture frame that I treasure. It   s on my wall,  and it   s a little bigger than this square here. Square would be that big.  (Gestures) It   s a pocketknife that my brother had when he was a little  boy, first one he ever had, a little pearl-handled pocketknife, and then a  little handkerchief that was my mother   s. She said,    This was your  momma   s.    That pocketknife was my brother   s, and then over on the  other side is a little doll about half an inch. He   s a little Eskimo doll. My  sister went to Alaska, and she stayed in Alaska. She died in Alaska, and  I guess she sent those. My brother had three daughters, so I guess she  sent those little dolls to them for Christmas, and this one girl put it in my  picture frame. It is so cute, little bitty thing. It   s solid gold. You don   t  want to stick your fingers to it, either.  Do you have plans for your next birthday?  I don   t care what happens, it don   t matter. I   m going to enjoy it. Y   all  can come and see me if you want to, I don   t care. I don   t care what  happens. I   m going to enjoy my birthday. What   ll I be, 102?   You   ll be  102.  Woo-hoo  Oh, it   s right around the corner.  You   ll have to get up and dance a jig.  Yeah, I guess I will. I guess I will. I haven   t thought about it. Out in the  23  Finchum  Ninness  Bishop  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  middle of this floor and living room up there, I   ve got lots of places to  dance, haven   t I?  You sure do.  You want to go dancing?  (Laughs) You bet.  I got him now, I got him now.  Alright then. We thank you very much for sharing your stories with us  today, Hortense.  I don   t know whether it   ll amount to much or not.  It is. It was a pleasure, always a pleasure.  Thank you very much. I   m glad you came down. I admire that little  necklace that you got on, that   s cute.  Thank you.  -------  -------
