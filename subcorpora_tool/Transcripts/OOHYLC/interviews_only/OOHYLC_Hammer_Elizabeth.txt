 Finchum  Today is April 14, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Pryor, Oklahoma, to speak with Elizabeth Hammer. This is part of our  100 Year Life Project, so thank you for having us today. Let   s start with  when and where you were born.  Fairland, Oklahoma, December 31, 1913.  So you are already a hundred, then?  Yes, yes.  And what did your parents do for a living?  Well, in younger days I don   t really know. My father was the youngest  of nine kids. He lost his parents at an early age, so his bachelor brothers  and his three sturdy sisters that had married really well took care of him  and made a home for him until he was almost eighteen.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  I had three sisters. One died in infancy, and then two to mature.  And where in the birth order are you?  The oldest one died, and I   m second, and then the third and fourth  already passed away.  Did your father work on a farm or own a farm?  5  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  He married my mother, and she had her allotment, Cherokee Indian  allotment.  My dad   s  brothers knew  the possibility of the draft , so  they  offered  to teach him to farm. When I was young, (I remember  this, too, and this was before World War I, war and rumors of war) they  said,    You   d better learn how to farm. You come move in,    and so we  moved into my uncle   s place. Both uncles moved upstairs and let us  have the first floor, and they provided, what you   d say, a livelihood.  My mother raised chickens and had an income of her own. I do  remember that, gathering up the eggs, a lot of them every day, big  buckets full. They allowed him to have the income off of eighty acres of  wheat, and we lived there. He got his card to go into the service, and at  that time he had two daughters and one on the way, and he had to meet  with the, I guess you   d say, the board in Muskogee.  I   m going to tell you what. This   ll just knock you down. He had three  brothers-in-law. It took seven to be on that   it wasn   t a rationing board.  What do you call it? Anyway, this  draft  board decided when you made  it, when you were to get your card. If you wanted to protest it, you met  with a board in Muskogee, and my daddy had three brothers-in-law on  the board out of seven. Five was a quorum; always would be five. He  had one from Miami, one from Fairland, and one from Pryor. Nobody  else would. Anyway, that   s just nice to know. You see, he was farming  at that time. That was in    17. He   d already started, see, like two years  older. My daddy   s folks were the educated part of our life. My mother   s  folks were Cherokee Indians, and they didn   t take education too  seriously. They liked the music and all that. What else? (Laughter)  The  Smith orchards were known for their fruit as well as for their  vegetables.   Besides gathering eggs, did you have other chores?   Fed the chickens, helped with my little sisters.  I didn   t have  many  chores . I was young   I just thought I   d clue you in on some things.  So your mother was full Cherokee?  No, half. Her daddy is full-blood. Her mother is Irish  from Illinois ,  full-blood Irish.  Had they come to Oklahoma from some other part?   Their coming to Oklahoma had something to do with the Civil War. My  grandfather   s parents as teenagers were both on the Trail of Tears. My  grandfather was Walter Smith, a full blood, and his father was Cullacaya  Smith and his mother was Rachel Kingfisher.   6  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Okay.  I mean  my mother   s  grandparents.  From North Carolina?  I really believe it   s   I have it down what section it   s from, but my  grandfather   s mother and daddy both were on the Trail. You want to  know their names and all that?  Only if you want to share them.  My grandfather   s mother was Rachel Kingfisher, and  his  daddy was  Cullacaya Smith.  They and  this other man, John Miller, were all out on  the Trail. As I get it, they were teenagers, young, fourteen, fifteen, see.  That   s the age that can stand all kinds of weather, and they survived it.  Rachel married John Miller first, and they had one child  Andy Miller ,  and he died. Then she married Cullacaya Smith, and they had   . I was  told just recently there were seven kids, and I had knowledge, of just  four: two girls and two boys. Here lately, grandfather   s sister   s great-granddaughter  surfaced, and she wants to know some information, so  she   s coming in next month from California. She was told by another  second-cousin that if she wanted to know anything firsthand that I would  know it. What I know I   ll tell them.  I was privileged to know my full  blood grandfather and two of his sisters.  Well, when you were little, where did you go to school?   I didn   t start school when I was six. We lived south of Zena,  Oklahoma.  I was almost seven before I started school because of the  distance to school. Mom wouldn   t let me ride a horse to school, four  miles.  Our house burned, and we moved to Mom   s allotment home at  Hickory Grove, north of Grove, Oklahoma.   When you did go, where did you start?  Hickory Grove  School  1  and that was in Delaware County. Hickory  Grove  is located four miles north of Grove, Oklahoma, crossing the  Sailboat Bridge (officially called Grove Highway Bridge). The lake was  created when the Pensacola Dam was built in the late 1930s and early  1940s.   Grand River was formed by two rivers merging northeast of Oklahoma.  The Neosho River from Kansas and the Spring River from Missouri  merge and there are twin bridges, one over each river. When people  7  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  living south of this merge talk about heavy rains upstream or a big rain  at headwaters, it was a big deal. So Grand River was commonly called  the Mighty Grand.  My mother   s allotment was on Grand River.  Hickory Creek was on one side.   Actually we lived on the highest point of the ridge. Below our house the  section line separated the large river bottom field. My dad called it the  south forty plus acres. Below the ridge on the east was the Hickory  Creek where there was a patch of tillable land, about twenty acres. He  cultivated both areas raising corn. I really don   t know the acreage  because she had a smaller acreage she sold to buy their first automobile.    When the Pensacola Dam was built in early 1940s creating Grand Lake  our house was the only place that was left showing. I   ve been there by  boat and it   s marshy with a lot of tall trees. You can see this island on  the road map and as you drive across the Sailboat Bridge. The island is  called Hickory Point.    Going back to Hickory Grove School , was it a one-room schoolhouse?  No, three  and it was brick .  Three?  It   s there, yet.  The school is being used as a community center and  church and for weddings and reunions.   Okay.  Step around. On the wall, you   ll see how much of a granny I am. I have  pictures all over the wall.  When we finish up we   ll go take a look.  Let   s just do it right now. Let   s let you look  at the brick school built in  1913 and it still looks good .  The girls got little jobs delegated to them. My daddy said if we helped  out   of course, they   d be responsible for our coats and shoes and all that  for winter. My daddy, you see, he was a farmer, farming Mama   s  allotment land. He called it    our farm  and the south forty ,    and we  lived on it. As I told you, we were close to Grand River, across from  Grove. He supplied feed for Riley Sparkman   s feedlot.  There are natural crossings up and down the river. There   s always been  natural crossings. Early day, people found them out. When I say    natural  8  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  crossing,    the base of the river was rock, when you say a natural  crossing.  Okay.  He told me that I would have the first load, and I could have a dollar. I  told him what I wanted to do with that dollar. This particular time, we  was all across the river in Grove, and my daddy came in with my dollar,  and I went in the drugstore and bought this. It   s d   Arman.  And you kept it all this time?  No, no, my grandson. No, mine got lost somehow. Mom said,    Let me  see.    I showed it to her, and she said,    You have to take that back. We  can   t afford that.    As I remember, we had a woman or two here visiting.  My daddy just took one step. He said,    Rachel, I promised her a dollar,  that she could have it.    That   s all there was to it. I told this to Allen, and  he got on the internet and got me a box. Now, he had to pay through the  nose for this box, but that survived. I was twelve, so twelve years old  makes it eighty-eight years old.  Special.  Yes, that   s one of my Christmas presents. (Laughter) How do you like  that one?  It   s nice. So where did you go to high school?  Well, we  moved from  that bottom when I was fourteen. Mom sold her  allotment.  We settled on a river bottom  in Mayes County between  Chouteau and Locust Grove, on  Highway 33. We finished the eighth  grade at McNair School.  I   ve always lived on one side  of Grand River   or the other.   Since  my dad  grew up  in Chouteau  he thought old acquaintances  would make it easier for Fern and I to adjust  he wanted us to go there  instead of Locust Grove.  My dad lived with his sister   s family, moving  to Chouteau in 1903 when his brother-in-law, Will A. Crockett, became  a part of the  Gray and Adkins  Mercantile Company . That was an  early-day pioneer store. They had everything.  We had a pickup, and a pickup was our only transportation. My sister  started school the same time I did when I was back in Hickory Grove,  when she was five and I was nearly seven, so we went to high school  together.  In the fall of 1928 my folks  rented a  one-  room  apartment   in the Gray Mansion  so my sister and I could go to high school. The  9  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  mansion had been turned into apartments for school girls  and Fern and I  had a room there. I guess you could say we had a rented apartment in  Chouteau for four years. See, going to high school ninety years ago was,  I guess you   d say, a sacrifice. Well, there wasn   t any transportation, for  one thing. Another thing, everybody didn   t go to high school.  What year did you graduate from high school?  Thirty-two, 1932.  And then what did you do?  Went to Northeastern  State Teachers College in Tahlequah, Oklahoma  which is now Northeastern State University. I attended one year,  September through August, and completed forty-five college hours to  earn a Teaching Certificate. My methods teacher, Flossie B. Templeton,  was a great teacher.  I taught school for the first two years by myself.  I   ve taught a lot of years by myself.  So what did you teach?  All grades from one to eight.  And subjects? All of them?  Well, yes. I had a good methods teacher that told me you can combine  an awful lot. You have to have reading every day, you have to have  math every day, you have to have spelling every day, everybody. You  can use the big kids if they   re good, like eighth graders and seventh  graders. They   ll work like crazy and do their work, but I   m going to tell  you something. It   s hard on the teacher to do all that, so she taught me  how to map it out and how to correlate it and all that, and so I saw to it. I  heard them once  a day , everybody.  Now, in the reading, you can read whatever book. You might want it to  be an English lesson, or you might want it to be a geography lesson, or  you might want a health lesson. Whatever it is, that particular reading  and writing is all combined in that area. Everybody has to have math,  and everybody has to have spelling. The seventh and eighth graders, (I  didn   t have many) the lesser you have the better, and they   ll work like  everything and do a nicer job. Wasn   t no messing around about it. All  the written work, I looked at and graded, and that   s one of the main  things you better do. If you want to do an assignment, you better grade it  and record it. I learned that early. She taught me some things about  discipline that worked with me all my years. She said the lower your  voice, the better it sounds to the kids. (Laughs) Several good things.  10  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  What are the other things? It   d be interesting to hear.  Well, that   s one of them, and she said it   s best not to make a lot of rules.  Then she said it   s best not to do anything that you can   t back up. Don   t  get yourself on a limb and then get the limb cut off. A lot of things, but  the main thing she says,    Don   t sweat the little stuff.    When I taught  junior high over at Claremore, I taught there fifteen years, science in the  junior high. I used all of those. It worked, and my principal said he  thought Mrs. Hammer was a natural as far as discipline was concerned.  You lower your voice. My voice carried, anyway. I could just speak just  enough for you to hear me in the kitchen, not very loud, but they could  hear it. Not now. I don   t have a good voice. I had two carotid artery  surgeries, and it   s done something to my voice, the strength of it.   She taught me about lesson plans, to have meaningful ones and to be  prompt in grading and returning their work. If the assignment is written,  always collect the papers, check them, record their work grades, and  return their papers. I always returned their written work their next  meeting and would go over the written if it was a test. They were to  correct their mistakes, turn in the paper to me and I would file them in  their folders.   So how long did you teach?  Oh   .  Thirty-five years or so?  Yes, not forty, but I taught   let   s see. I taught one, two, three, four as  the principal. When I went to Claremore, they needed a teacher.  Somebody referred me, and they said they knew I was qualified but they  didn   t know whether I could do it or not because I thought I was going  to take early retirement. Well, we   d already educated the kids, and so he  said he didn   t think I needed to teach if I didn   t want to. I thought I was  going to stop for a little.  We went to the  1962  World   s Fair, and we were gone a month because  we wanted to see everything between here and the World   s Fair in  Seattle, Washington. On the way back, we visited some friends in  Montana about five days, and our in-laws here.  Before we returned  home the Claremore City Schools superintendent came over to Pryor to  talk to me about a vacancy. He was told by Ellworth   s brother that we  should be visiting friends in Montana. He even made a call right then  and found we had spent five days with them and had left that morning  for home.   11  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  When we did get back, I was notified. I taught three days. I started the  middle of the week, three days. I thought it was just a substitute job and  at the end of that time could I substitute another week, the next week. I  guess what they was doing was seeing if I could handle it or not. At the  end of that week I had a contract, and that   s the way that happened. He  said,    I know she   s qualified, and she   s been principal for several years.  She ought to know how to handle kids.     Well, over the course of those years of teaching, things changed a lot, I  would think.  Yes, but I loved every day of it. The principal said I made better lesson  plans than anybody. You know, the funny thing about it, in the  beginning there will just be a few teachers. When I went to high school,  four teachers handled the whole thing. Now I bet you three dozen would  get to catch it. That   s right. There   s this and this and this and this and  this. There   s too much of this and this. (Laughs)  What were a few of the other things that changed in the teaching world?  Well, that   s a big thing. That was a new experience, just one class. I  loved that one-class business. It made me know my business really good.  School lunches changed a lot during that time?  Yes, probably so. I didn   t have much to do with the school lunch  program.  Well, let   s back up and tell me how you met your husband.  To be real honest, let me just tell you this. My Uncle Crockett and  Jackson had the store here. Crockett and Jackson were partners. My  husband   s father was partnered with Jackson in stockyards, buying and  selling livestock, mostly buying and shipping, all right? When we  moved to Mayes County I was fourteen, and my sister and I and my  parents, we   d come to town. We   d always go to the Crockett store. They  was kinfolks. In old-fashioned stores, they used to have, in all the stores,  an office where you   d have to climb a little step back in the corner.  You   ve seen that, I guess.  Yes.  Well, that   s what we had here. That   s what they had. The nicest store in  town, Crockett and Jackson, grocery and meat market and all that.  Ellsworth finished high school in 1927, had gone to business college.  12  He   d already graduated, had gone to business college and  come  back,  and he knew the Crockett kinfolks that moved in the county. He knew  we lived on a farm and all that. All right, let me grow up now. We  moved when I was a freshman in high school, so when I was a senior, he  helped the teacher in the area where he lived out in the country.   Ellsworth helped bring in students from the Hammer School District  who were going to be signing in for different entries in the track meet at  Chouteau. His family   s  ranch house is still there, big, nice ranch house.  Ellsworth   s folks had a little bit more than the cut, the natural cut. Big  house, big ranch, big everything, four boys. He let me grow up, he said.  I didn   t know him at all. When I came home, 1936   see, we moved here  in    28, so that made me twenty-two, I guess.  Ellsworth never had been married, never been involved. Mr. and Mrs.  Hammer, themselves, didn   t marry early. They were, like, thirty. I think  she was thirty-something, -three maybe, when she married Mr. Hammer  and came to this country. Mr. Hammer, Ellsworth   s dad, came to this  area and scouted it out. He first went west of Vinita and then around  Sapulpa and then meandered up to Mayes County and decided this  would be the place. He established himself, always writing her a letter  and telling her the progress. He went back, married her in December,  and they moved in, already situated. What I   m really trying to get  around to tell you, they didn   t marry early, the boys. I think Marvin  married first  in 1936 .  When my sister and I came home from college   we did our college  work by piecemeal: teach, go to school, teach. We didn   t stay for August  extension. We just did the summer session, nine weeks, so we were  home. My sister had an appointment already. She was ready for  company. When Ellsworth came this hot August, August the ninth   no  that wasn   t it. It was July yet. Anyway, she was ready to receive our  guests. That   s when Ellsworth came. While he was talking to her, her  date came up, and so he knew. He just got in his pickup and drove on  across the river to the Arterberys    store and camping grounds.  It was a big to-do. Everybody liked to be there for picnics and set their  camping. Everybody knew, and they   d been well established, so they  knew him, too.    Where in the world, Ellsworth, have you been, and  where are you going?    He said,    I went over to the Purcells   , but I got  dismissed pretty quick, just kind of smooth. I   m needing a Coca-Cola  pop. I   m needing some pop.    They said,    Oh, we know who to talk to,  Ellsworth, if you   re interested.    He said,    Oh, I   m interested.    They  said,    Go back in about a week or two because Fern will be going to her  school, and Elizabeth won   t be. I   d wait, if I was you, about a couple of  weeks.     13  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  July 9, 1936, he came back. I didn   t know  about the visit with Fern . I  didn   t know what the Arterberys had told him, see. I didn   t know any of  that, so there he came. I was raking the yard. Hot day, so he came early  enough, as I told you, all slicked up, white shoes and panama hat, white  pants and all that, good looking. He was good looking. He said would I  like to go the show. Oh, I did. I got ready real quick. He said,    Oh, you  have plenty of time,    so I did bath and all. I don   t know what the show  was about, but it was air conditioned, and I loved every bit of it.  (Laughter) Isn   t that funny, I didn   t even remember the name of the.... I  loved that air conditioning, I   ll tell you.  Was the show in Pryor?  Yes.  So if that was    36, how soon did you get married, then?  Now, on 1936 the fairs was going on, and when school started, he came  down on a Saturday and wanted me to go to Muskogee Fair. There  again, I didn   t know he was coming. We didn   t have a telephone and all  that, so he always manages times I   m going to have plenty of time. Then  the first  August 1934  Vinita rodeo, he took me to that. That was the  next, second. First thing he took me besides a show was to see rodeo at  Vinita that same August. Then after that everything was major. The next  thing was the fair at Muskogee. Then after school started, if he had  business over in the southeast part of the county, he always managed to  come just about the time that school was out. The kids would say,    Miss  Purcell, do you think Ellsworth   s going to come by this  evening  and  pick us up?    Wasn   t that cute? (Laughs)  At Christmas, I went there. His mother liked to entertain because she  had things to entertain with and a big house, and with not having any  relatives, she invited friends. She made Christmas. She loved to do that.  She told the boys,    I   d like for you to bring your girlfriends for  Christmas,    so we got an invitation. Did you not know, I met for the first  time those other three girls. Marvin had married that September, before  this first Christmas. Marvin was there. She said,    Marvin   s going to  bring his new wife in, and you boys bring your friends.    First time I met  all those girls. We married the next year. We married first, December     37. We met in    36, August. Ruth, the youngest, youngest boy and the  youngest of the girls married December    41, and then Herb married  Retha in    43. He was next to my husband. Can   t you see how old he  was? He was thirty-six.  So you got married in    37. Did you go on a honeymoon?  14  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  No, we didn   t have the money to. We didn   t have the money to do  anything, honey. I had my salary.  I stayed with my parents and  continued until the school term was out in April. Then Ellsworth moved  me and my cedar chest to his parents    big house until late 1938 when he  bought our first house. I had saved enough money to redecorate the four-room  (two-bedroom) house. I traded my school warrants for a year for  furnishings. I bought one full bedroom suite, a sofa, two good chairs,  two end tables, a lamp, a rug, venetian blinds for the living room, stove,  and dinette set. I also paid for kitchen cabinets. Ellsworth had the house  plumbed with complete indoor plumbing like a new house.   It was after the Depression, but still, things were   .  Oh, it was still the Depression. It was Depression for a long time.  Actually, the Depression wasn   t really over until World War II was over.  That   s how long everything was tied up. I had one girl out of the first  year I taught and one girl out of the second year I taught that came to  town and worked at the rationing office and came to my house to stay  with me. I let them stay.  They fixed their own breakfast, and I served  dinner each evening for forty cents per month.   My birthday party   I didn   t have a party this year. I didn   t want it, and  I   ll tell you why. I thought it was too much work for the weather like it  was going to be. I read up on it, and I told my daughter, I said,    Don   t. I  think you   re just wasting your money, your time, your energy to plan it  on the twenty-first of December.    It turned out exactly the way I said it  would be. You know how bad the weather was in December. She threw  a big one when I was ninety. When I say I    threw a big one,    she did  everything.  Well, did you expect to live to a hundred?  You know what? At that ninetieth party, I didn   t know I was old until I  was ninety. (Laughter) I didn   t. That sounds crazy, but I mean that.  It snuck up on you.  Well, no, honey. Nothing bothered me then, nothing, absolutely nothing.  I   ve just been slowed up. I quit driving in August.  Of this year?  Thirteen.  Thirteen, wow.  15  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  I still can drive, but I just don   t.  Any reason why?  Well, as my son said,    Everybody in town knows you   re a hundred.     (Laughter) That   s what he said, so he takes me to     They   ll just get out of your way, then.  He comes and takes me to the beauty shop. That   s a fact.  You talked about the Great Depression. What was that like?  Rationing. If I   d known I was going to get into that, I would have  brought my rationing thing out here. I have what was rationed here and  when, and when, and when, and when, and everybody, the whole nine  yards.  Mostly sugar and flour?  Oh, most everything, honey. Canned goods, meat, you name it. It was  rationed. Shoes, gasoline, cars.  And they had the ammunition plant here, too, didn   t they?  They built that, started in    41. In town, the man that owned the house  next door to us divided his house into two apartments. The area  superintendent lived there. She and I became good friends in    41, and  they didn   t leave until    45. We had a real good relationship. She died last  year. Will be a year this month.  What were some of the things you would do for fun, entertainment?  Growing up, we did the simple things.  Any excuse for a gathering;  church, Sunday school, picnics, birthday events, holidays. Our parents  would take us to Fairland on Saturday. The theater shows were free for  children so we saw many movies.   We made our own decorations for the Christmas tree, for one thing. Not  only was it busy work but it was creative and we had a nice, decorated  tree. We popped popcorn and strung into  ropes . We made chains, and  we saved foil and anything that was red. The Big Chief tablets had red,  you know. We saved those, and we   d use part of that for red decorations,  and foil. We could use foil, too. Everybody saved foil. Now, at Hickory  Grove when I was in the first and second grade, they had candles on the  tree, but I   m going to tell you something. There was a burnout  16  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  somewhere in the state, and that stopped everybody from having real  candles on the tree. That   s right.  Pretty but dangerous.  Pretty but very dangerous, yes. Very, very dangerous, but six or eight  candles on there really made it look good. I remember them.  Did your mother do a lot of canning?  Oh, yes. We had one family in the neighborhood that had a lot of kids,  and they really made big gardens. They put some money together   well,  her daddy did. They bought the  cannery . I   m talking about the metal  cans and they canned. Before that, they did canning in jars, but they did  it both ways. My mother raised a big garden, always did. They didn   t  have time. It got so that they didn   t do anything on it and did  only   other   s people   s  canning . We paid in vegetables, peas and beans and  all that.  Would they can their meat?  Well, yes. That   s another thing. Let me tell you. I was teaching. No, I  was going to school in the summer. I came home. Now, this was before I  was married. Ellsworth Hammer, he went to business college in Tulsa,  so he had the knowledge of livestock. When I say    the knowledge of  livestock,     if he  had a cow, could tell you how much it weighed. You  have to get good. You have to get good on that. If you   re in the business,  you can do that. You could almost tell if a cow has been loaded just  before it   s come to town with drinking water or whether it   s been fed.  You kind of have to calculate that. He had the feel. When I say that,    the  feel of livestock,    I mean all the livestock, and you have the business  mind. He was on all government programs, chairman of all the  government programs, as young as he was, not some old, fat, gray-headed  man, no. That young, slender did it all.  What he did   he told me this is what he did. He said he got the farmers     names from the   what department of the county takes care of that?  Anyway, he got every farmer   s name, and he wrote them a card and told  them what day he would be there at their place in plenty of time for them  so they could have everybody to have their animals up. He went through  this: this is what you keep, this is what you sell, this over here is what  you have to kill. That was the cattle part. We   d know they were coming,  so my dad shows the very best-looking calf. You had to make a choice  that day that he wanted us to have for beef, so he set that one aside, had  it butchered first, hung it up, let it drip and whatever you call it, bring it  17  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  to town, let the carcass hang for a good month, let it cure, they call it,  then we canned it.  That   s another thing. I   ll stop right here. When we moved to this county  when I was fourteen, we had neighbors. We lived on the river, but we  had one neighbor here, one behind us, and one down just a little here.  Then around the block we had two more. They invited my mother to  their monthly meeting. I said,    Mom, are you going to go?    Her being  Cherokee, I   m surprised she didn   t, but she just didn   t. She said,    No, I  don   t think so.    I said    Do you care if I do?    See, I was always  wanting   my sisters didn   t, but I did. I said,    Mom, could I go?       Well,  you can if you want to.    You see, I could cook. I started cooking when I  was eight. Mom had these kids, these other two, and she needed some  help. You always use the one that   s available.  In the Dust Bowl days, too, you talked something when I was here last  time     Oh, yes. Let me tell you something. We had dust in the air for years.  Because, I mean, you often think     Sand is what we        about western Oklahoma and the Panhandle, but how did it affect     It affected us up here, and the droughts were awful. We had grit on  everything. Sometimes it   d be in the air. You could see it worse more  than others some days, but you could always tell it was in the air because  it would land on your furniture because we didn   t have all this modern  stuff. What else were we talking about?  Did you farm during the drought, or were you     Oh, yes. We had a river bottom land, and my daddy got his crops out  early. They didn   t all dry up. The bottom land  holds its moisture  better.  We were fortunate that Mama started out with a good one. They made  sure they got it down here because they wouldn   t have been happy with  up-land at all.  What did he grow? What was his     Corn and oats. We fed oats to the chickens. My mother was a chicken  woman, always. My mother, the Smiths, even though we   re Cherokees,  they were the workingest bunch you ever saw. I could tell you how they  do everything, but I won   t do that today.  18  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  My coworker would want to know how she killed them. Did she have a  method for slaughtering them?  Let me tell you. We didn   t can chicken. We had chicken all the time. If  she wanted a certain one, she had a wire thing that she fixed on the end  of a stick, and catch that. I learned to do it this way. Wring their necks.  Had you ever heard of that?  Mom would chop the heads off.   Yes.  Not only that, I could pluck the chicken, and I could cut it up.  Not too many people can do that today.  I learned that, honey. I learned that. Let   s see. I didn   t do that at eight,  but I did it pretty quick after that. I learned to make bread at eight. I  learned to make a cake at eight. I cooked my mother   s birthday dinner  when I was ten. I mean I did everything when I was ten.  How would they do the laundry?  When I was down at Zena,  Oklahoma,  Mama had a washing machine  that my daddy had to do the  cranking of the wheel agitator . She had  three kids, one in diapers and a baby coming, so she had to have help.  My daddy would do the agitator. I remember seeing it with wood, and it  was on the outside. We moved out because when we left Zena, our  house burned. It didn   t burn Mama   s washer. Mama had a brand new  Singer sewing machine, a really nice one, and it got some holes burned  in it. That didn   t stop it from being a good machine, though. Now, that   s  one of the things that I remember we had nice is a cook stove, the cream  separator, and the buffet. A real nice piece of merchandise, the buffet  was. She had Rayo  kerosene  lamps. We had really good beds and  bedclothes. We used good bedclothes. I said the cook stove.  The cook  stove had six caps and a large reservoir so there was always plenty of  water for baths.  We had a few things that were real nice and the sewing  machine.  Was it a pedal sewing machine?  Yes.  So she made your clothes and everyone?  You bet.  19  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Did she quilt?  No, she didn   t quilt. She didn   t much like to do that. She made  comforters, tacked them. It was quicker, warmer. Quilts are cold, and  comforters are warm.  And for refrigeration?  You know, we were fortunate down here to have the ice man to come by  every day when we were on the river. He had a route. As I told you,  there was several in the settlement. That made a difference in the one  here and a mile down the road yonder and then another mile over yonder  because there   s one here and two or three blocks down here, and that   s  the way they were. The land was back toward the river.  Did you have very many traveling salesmen or hobos come by?  Oh, we had people wanting something to eat. They   d just love to do  something for something to eat.  My dad would give them enough gas  for about thirty to fifty miles. Mom always cooked extra. Never a day  went by without usually a car jam-packed with everything; kids,  mattress on top. Even though we milked and separated the cream she  always saved back a gallon or so, so if the kids wanted milk, they got  cold milk.   Every day Mom would make extra everything, and she could hardly  stand for little kids not to have plenty to eat. I   ll tell you what. I   ve seen  many a car even in my sleep loaded with kids, and stuff on top of the  cars, going back to mamas and papas or grandmas and grandpas. We   d  get the whole story while they were there. They didn   t turn back a  person. She   s even sent milk with them. You can   t beat that.  No, you can   t.  Now let me tell you about Grandma Hammer. As I told you, they had  lots of everything. I   d like to go get their picture. I have a picture of Mr.  Hammer   s sale in 1908. During Depression years, he   d have the boys  to   he   d say,    Ellsworth or Clarence, I want you to take this milk cow  over to so and so.    See, cattle were selling at two cents a pound     Wow.     two cents a pound, and so they sold the good stuff, but the milk cows  they never sold. He spread it out, two dozen milk cows over the  countryside. All they would do was to find some food for the cows so  they give the milk for the family. Milk cows. Now how do you like that?  20  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  I   m going to tell you something. He   ll be rewarded, so help me. He was  very generous. They all were generous. If somebody needed something,  they got it if they went to the Hammers. Mrs. Hammer came from  Sweden, the old country. She came, got her education in Kansas City at  the Sweden school. Mr. Hammer is Dutch.  I wonder how they ended up here.  I told you. Mr. Hammer was     Oh, looking around.  He was looking for a place to settle.  That   s right.  He wanted a deal of his own, and that ranch is a section.  It sounds like you had a good relationship with your in-laws.  Oh, yes. Mr. Hammer thought I couldn   t do no wrong. (Laughter)  His son married the right woman.  Yes. Let me tell you something. See, when Marvin married and brought  his wife in, her name was Hammer to begin with, but she was white. She  was from one of those foreign countries. I can   t remember right now, but  she came. Her parents couldn   t even speak English. Mr. Hammer and  Mrs. Hammer went to their wedding. They couldn   t understand a word  that the mother and daddy said, not a word.  Was religion very important when you were growing up?  Oh yes, yes. Now where I grew up until we moved to Mayes County, we  lived in an area that was non-denominational, so there wasn   t any racket.  Anybody come along that wanted to preach, they allowed them. That   s  one of the things that we never missed. In the summertime, brush arbor  meetings. You know what a brush arbor is, don   t you?  Well, let me tell you what it is. I guess you   d say they   ve staked it or put  up or dug up. If it   s natural, they   ll whittle up trees, I mean take all the  limbs off and create one if there   s a lot of timber, create one, and then  put a top across it, limbs and all that stuff on top of that. That   s a brush  arbor. Brush arbor.  21  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum   Across the main road from the Hickory Grove School the community  built a permanent arbor. The men cut the timber and hauled it to the  sawmill to be cut, which was about a half mile. From my memory the  arbor was about thirty feet wide and some fifty feet long. Posts had to be  cut long enough to allow some three to four feet to be anchored in the  ground and cemented in. The timbers would be connected across the top,  substantial but not solid. Each summer new brush would be cut and  placed on top for summer usage. And there was a big oak tree close by  northwest of the podium where the community dippers would be hung,  close to the water kegs.   And why would they  build an arbor ?  Well, they wanted it to have their meetings.  Under it?  Underneath it.  Okay, for shade?  Yes, for shade. I don   t know why they felt like they didn   t want open  skies over them. We always had the brush arbor, and everybody came in  because we were going to have a meeting. It didn   t make any difference  if it was Lutheran or if it was the ones out West, you know, Mormons.  Sure did. They were as welcome as they could be. Nobody fussed,  nobody, and Sunday school was a good deal, every Sunday. If we didn   t  have a minister that came by, we had several of the men in the  neighborhood that could take charge.  And what would your Sunday meal be after church?  Oh, a good dinner. And you know what? Fried chicken most of the time.  We had ham at certain times, and we didn   t ever buy a turkey. We didn   t  buy turkeys. We didn   t raise turkeys. We didn   t. You didn   t have much  if you didn   t raise. We had beef because we raised the beef. Most of the  time   somebody would butcher and then pass it through the  neighborhood and you bought whatever you wanted, and then they  would just slash it off. If you wanted steak, my daddy usually bought a  piece of steak so she could fry it, and then a roast. That   s what he   d buy  off of the wagon. They would butcher good beef.  How about politics?  22  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  My mother and daddy are   she said    Girls, your daddy would turn in  his grave if he knew that his sons-in-law weren   t strong democrats like  we are.    (Laughs)  So, that means you didn   t vote for Henry Bellmon when he was running  for governor.  I did vote for Bellmon, oh, yes. I   m not a Democrat. My daddy doesn   t  know that. (Laughter) My mother don   t either.  He was a great citizen.   That was a family secret.  That   s a family secret. I   m going to tell you something. I have a boy  that   s dyed  in the wool . He thinks even Obama has done no wrong. We  don   t fuss about it.  Well, I want to know. Your birthday is on December 31. You must have  had some pretty memorable birthdays.  As I told you, I didn   t know I was old until I was ninety. That was the  biggest one I had. My birthdays were combined with Christmas...  I   ll be darned.     yes, so it was a bad deal.  No, not really.   You never got to stay up to midnight, ring in the new year?  Oh, I   ve stayed up more than midnight this year. I think it was two  o   clock before we ever piped down. (Laughter) I think that   s right. It  was my daughter, her son, her two kids, my niece at Chouteau, and  others that went home earlier than that, and we cut one of the cakes at  midnight.  I was going to say, that would be your birthday.  Oh, I had cakes. The day of my birthday, I didn   t have a party. People  just came that wanted to come.  Really, I was busy all day with callers  and gifts of flowers.   Growing up, though, with your birthday being on New Year   s Eve,  wasn   t much extra?  No, country people a long time ago didn   t try to make a big deal out of  New Year   s Eve. That came along about into my adulthood, but my  23  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  adulthood came early because I never had a childhood life. That   s a fact.  Didn   t have time for it.  New Year   s Eve came along with Dick Clark and the dropping of the     Oh, yes.     ball.  About like that, so you came in then. You remember all of that stuff.  And Lawrence Welk.  Yes, oh, yes.  Do much dancing over his music at a party?  Oh, yes.  I was going to say, what did you do for entertainment?  At Grandpa and Grandma   s house  mother   s family , they had   they  were musicians, I told you a while ago. My mother could play by ear,  and she had a sister that could play the organ by ear, so they had an  organ and two or three kinds of guitars and violins. She had two brothers  that really were good. Mama   s one of eleven. My daddy   s one of nine. I  knew both of my grandparents on my mother   s side, mother and daddy  both.  They have square dances or     Oh, yes, they had square dances. The night before we moved to Mayes  County when I was fourteen, they had a square dance at our house. They  just come in and moved the furniture and got with it. We had no idea  they was going to do it. They took care of the dining room pretty quick.  Do you remember seeing your first car?  Yes, we had friends that had cars before we ever got a car. We didn   t get  one until    27, the year before we moved out.  Did you ever drive a truck?  A pickup.  A pickup.  24  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  My daddy bought a new pickup in 1934. Now, he had to be pretty  prosperous to do that. I was taught to drive when I was fourteen. Then  when he got the new pickup, I drove it. I even drove my basketball team  to Pryor to the tournament. My daddy would put hay down in the bed  and then a tarpaulin over that, and then another tarpaulin to put over the  kids, and we put as many in the cab that could get in it. (Laughter) I  would drive them, like, Graham, about five miles or six miles to our  house, and then on to Chouteau, and then up the highway up here, and  get up here by nine o   clock. That   s pioneering, isn   t it?  You played on the basketball team?  Oh, yes, I did. I played on the basketball team when I was  in the sixth  grade  at Hickory Grove. I tell you what. Exercise is it. If you get it in  the early days, the better, and the more you get. Now, I wasn   t a very  good runner. For one thing, we lived on a hill, like I told you, and if I  run, I just gained momentum as I went down. You won   t do that flip but  about once and you   re over that. You learn that you can   t do it. I wasn   t  a very good runner, but I could play basketball. We had volleyball and  basketball, both, at Hickory Grove. At Hickory Grove, I could very well  remember in the sixth grade I was on the team. I never had a still  moment, walking to school, playing at school. When I was in high  school, I played on the team. When my daughter went to high school, it  was kind of a no-no over here in Pryor. The girls didn   t play basketball,  and so, consequently, she missed that.  When I went to college, I took the athletic part, too. I didn   t go through  the year down there, only one. They didn   t let you take the athletic part  if you   re going to get a teaching  certificate . They put you in games so  you could do these things on the ground. We have six teachers colleges.  Northeastern  at Tahlequah  is a teachers college. Edmond is a teachers  college. We had six. Their business was to educate the teachers. If they  knew that you was going to go right out in the classroom, they wanted  you to have that kind of a mix instead of basketball. I had basketball, so  I knew basketball. I can   t remember when I didn   t know basketball.  What kind of uniform did you have to wear?  Oh, when we played on the team, we had shorts, believe it or not.  Not bloomers?  We had bloomers when I went to  grade  school  and ready-made  uniforms in high school .  25  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Was it half-court or full-court for the girls?  It was half-court. Now, when we went in grade school, seemed to me  like we played all over the court.  In the early years the court was  divided into three areas.   Was it outside or inside?  Inside. When we came to town we played inside. At Hickory Grove we  played outside. All the rural schools had to play outside. We didn   t have  a gymnasium to go to.  On a dirt     Yes. Dirt, dirt, dirt.  The year we moved away Hickory Grove School  1  built a wonderful gym. Now it is used a lot for funerals, receptions, and  other events.   So what do you attribute your longevity to?  Well, exercise is one of them, I really believe. I really believe that. I get  more exercise. I   ve always gotten more exercise than either one of my  kids or either one of my sisters. I think we eat plain food, wholesome  food.  At my home it isn   t necessary to put the salt and sugar on the  table.  When you eat what you raise, right now these people that are  raising this stuff, they just run and get it down there. In Tulsa, all over  the town there   s different places where you can get the fresh stuff on  Saturday morning. Different farms come in and bring their stuff and set  up, and they   re open so many hours a day on Saturday. I think maybe  lifestyle. That covers all that doesn   t it?  And do you exercise every day today?  No, but I   m able to walk. When I go to the beauty shop, in order for me  to stay in the seat I put my feet in the seat. There   s nobody else can even  do that. You know what I   m talking about don   t you? I don   t leave my  feet   I put my feet in the seat.  I   m not sure I can do that. (Laughter)  Well, instead of sliding out, I have to do that. I don   t have a very long  neck, so I   ve managed to do this, get myself back as far as I can. Then if  I get myself back as far as I can, I just put my feet in there, in the beauty  shop, so I won   t fall out.  Now, you said you didn   t drive. Is that right?  26  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  I don   t drive now, no.  So what   s a typical day like for you? What time do you wake up? What  do you do? What time do you go to bed? Do you have people run  errands for you? Do you have help?  Now, this girl here, she made my errands today. She didn   t make as  many as I wanted done.  So you have a person that runs errands for you during the day?  No, I just have help three times a week, but I   ll tell you what. I have a  girl that   s going to come around four, and I   ll tell you what she   s going  to help me do. I have to delete, or get rid of, some tax records because  the tax man said I had to keep five years. I really think seven are safe,  too. They   re getting it less. It used to be nine, don   t you remember?  Anyway, I have a lot of Ellsworth   s. I haven   t thrown away a one, so I  have a filing cabinet that we   re going to take down to the tax people and  they   re going to get rid of it for me. He told me he would. All I have to  do is sack it up, go to the back door, and they   ll take care of it. Of  course, he said it   d be free, but I   m not going to let it be free. I   ll be so  gracious to get it taken care of. The shredder will come.  Well, what time do you usually get up in the morning to start your day?  Well, let   s see. Sometimes I sleep in, and when I sleep in, most of the  time I get up about seven. If it   s really a dreary, cold day, after I   ve had  a cup of coffee, I might go back to the sofa, but most of the time I don   t.  When I get up, I just more or less   I never, never, never, never show up  in my night wear. (Laughter)  You   re ready to go for the day.  Well, usually, yes.  And what time do you usually go to sleep?  If I was you, if you want to talk to me, you could talk any time you  want, up to eleven.  Being at a hundred, do you have a philosophy of life or a motto that you  live by?  Nope, I just kind of rest on my laurels, I guess you could say.  27  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Bishop  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Anything on your wish list you haven   t done yet, bucket list?  Yes, I   d like to cruise the Rhine River again. I   m sorry I didn   t get to go  to Alaska. That   s one of the things I   d like. I   m sorry I didn   t make a trip  to Mississippi to see my friend that I knew back since 1941. I was in a  position I could have, but the time I didn   t do it I was busy with  extracurricular activities.  I belonged to the Business  and  Professional Women   s Club for many  years. It is not kosher for a treasurer to be treasurer more than one year,  but I was treasurer about eleven. I kept good books. (Laughter) That   s  the one thing. Back even whenever interest was, say like, 17 percent, I  remember one loud-mouthed woman, beautician. I gave the treasurer   s  report, and she piped up and said,    I   m not for locking in our money at  17 percent.    She liked it because it was different every day, and so  another one that was kind of a little louder than she was and probably  had a little bit more of a sense said,    I   m supporting Elizabeth   s, and I  think she knows best.    Sure enough I did know best. Seventeen percent  wasn   t bad to have it locked in, and we gave scholarships. I loved that  doing.  We didn   t let the  Pryor High  School dominate the scholarships. We did  more or less canvasing ourselves. We let all the club give us ideas on  who they liked, and so we kind of passed it around. We have a  Mennonite settlement up here, and their offspring needed it pretty bad.  In other words, we chose them. We loved that program. We gave a lot of  money away. We worked through the year doing different projects to   earn  money.  I don   t want to go to assisted living. I don   t want to go to the rest home.  I don   t know whether I   ll get to do it or not, but I   m going to choose to  stay right here. (Laughs) That   s my druthers.  I   d say you might make it.  Yes.  So do you do a Christmas card list every year?  Oh, you bet.  How many is on your list?  Well, to be real honest, I got over two hundred cards for Christmas and  my birthday.  I send 150 or more.   28  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  My gosh.     and on my list is a hundred and something.  Wow.   My main project now is helping  three missionaries  serving  in Nepal.   We save all papers, magazines, catalogues, directories and  this past  December we were able to send  four thousand dollars. There   s two  families, and so we   re working on four thousand dollars to give them  coming up.  I have a big cardboard box in the trunk of my car. It   s filled  every two weeks and a friend comes by to pick it up.  I save all my  paper. I   m talking about newspaper, Tulsa World. I get it every day. I  work Sudoku every  morning during breakfast and coffee . You know  what that is, don   t you?  I do.  Now they   ve got a new one coming out. I haven   t figured out a thing  with it. Somebody needs to tell me how to start. (Laughter)  So then are you a Jeopardy fan? No? Do you read books?  Oh, yes.  Do you have a particular kind that you like, biography, fiction, non-fiction?  No, I kind of like reality if I think there   s anything that   s real in it or  borderline of it, even. I pay thirty-five dollars a year and get the Justice  Magazine, and it tells me what   s going on. I do like to know what   s  going on. I fear for the generation coming up. Do you guys have any  fear of the way the trend   s going?  We were talking about it in the car, so yes, we do.  It scares me to death. My grandson has two kids coming up. The little  boy, he lives with his mother in Houston. His mother is a teacher. She  and the daddy got a divorce. I think it was in    05. That   s not good, but,  you know, I didn   t have anything to do with it. The little boy is so  wholesome. He said he takes keyboard and violin and Home Ec besides  his other   .  That   s good.  29  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Hoot Hammer  Hammer  H. Hammer  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Oh, he said he loved all of it. He   s twelve years old. He said,    Oh, don   t  worry about that. I just roll with it.    (Laughter)  Sounds like he got that from you. He just rolls with it. (Laughter)  Well, anything you can   t do anything about, you just better set it aside  and not worry about it because you can   t do anything about it, anyway.  That is a good philosophy. Get it. Now, my daughter worries to pieces.  Well, these kids are hers, you see. Her son and her grandkids. Hoot?  What?  Bring me Grandpa   s sale picture.  All right.  I want you to see this.  Hoot?  That   s my boy. His name   s Ellsworth Hoot. He has his MBA from OU.  Well, we won   t mention that, then. (Laughter)  Okay, here   s Grandpa Hammer   s sale in 1918. I want him to see it, too,  and minutely.  I   m always amazed by the   I find names interesting. People have some  interesting names. They   re very family-oriented and historical.  Well let me tell you something, now, there   s been families that   he was  the     He was selling mules.  He sold everything. He had cows and everything else.  My gosh.  Read all of it and soak it in. Goes down to the very bottom.  What   s the biggest challenge to being one hundred?  Don   t know.  I was busy every day. I worked like there was no  tomorrow.   30  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Bishop  Hammer  Finchum  Bishop  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Is there one? Not being able to drive, I guess.  Well, no, I can   t worry about that. I could go out there and drive right  now, just as well as I did last August, but I know definitely that I  couldn   t continue it. When he said,    You know, I think if I was you, I  would just kind of watch it, not that you can   t do it, but everybody  knows you   re a hundred.    We haven   t really lived anywhere else, you  know.  Yes. So this is home?  We built this house in 1969. I believe it   s forty-four or forty-five years  old.     Lunch served by the Red Cross.    It was such a big sale, the Red Cross  had to come out and serve dinner.  (Laughs) Out on the ranch house. Now, the ranch house isn   t two story  now. The grandson took it down to the very bottom and redone it and  put it in brick. It   s the same floor plan, but he put it back up in brick.  Anything else you want to ask before     Well, I want to know when history is written, what do you want it to say  about you?  What do you want me to say?  How do you want to be remembered?   In teaching I was firm, fair, and friendly. One of my former students, in  science in the eighth grade, in a public meeting in his remarks he made  this very statement. As a decent citizen, church worker as well as other  entities. As someone who helped the needy. Actually I   ve had a very  good life. I know I was a good teacher. I was Teacher-of-the Year when  I was teaching junior high at Claremore. I was chosen to be a VIM  (Volunteers in Mission) member from Mayes County and was honored  at the state conference at Oklahoma City.    Maybe you better tell it. I don   t really know how I want to be  remembered.     She just rolled with it.    (Laughter)  31  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Bishop  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Bishop  That   s Jeffrey   s words.    Mammy, don   t worry about that. I just roll with  it.    He was so happy to tell how many things he could cook, and I think  that   s good.  That   s very good.  His sister doesn   t know a thing about cooking, and my sisters didn   t  either when they married, even, because I did it instead, you see.  Anything else you want to add before we cut the camera off?  What do you want me to say, and I   ll say it. (Laughter)  What   s been the highlight?  Don   t know.  My conversation with you two and recalling some of the  past.   Advice for anyone else that wants to live to a hundred?  Well I just told you, I think exercise and your lifestyle.  Has humor played a role?  Oh yes. I think the best thing is to be positive about everything. I say  this. Everybody should be concerned, I think, of the way it   s going  down. I really do, and I   ll tell you, it   s become that way little by little,  don   t you think? Or do you think? (Laughter)  It   s your story so we   re not supposed to say     Yes, I   m not supposed to talk.  You   re the star of this show.  Well, I   m not very much of a star. (Laughter)  Well, we appreciate you sharing your story with us today. It   s been a  pleasure.  Do I have very much of a story?  Yes, you do.  Yes.  32  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Let me tell you one more story.  Okay.  When I was ten years old, and when I say that, my youngest sister   s  birthday was May the twenty-fourth. She always said, (Singing)    May  the twenty-fourth is my birthday, May       a little song. We lived across  the river from Grove. When I say across the river, Grove is four miles to  the river. We lived on the river, so we really lived four miles north of  Grove. You see that now. Beginning in the spring, you could ford the  river. That was even before the feedlot stuff was started; you don   t  deliver anything in May. Mother wanted to go over into Grove and buy  piece goods so she could get started with her sewing for the fall when  she wasn   t canning or gardening or this or that. She would have to  make   everything was homemade. I mean everything. She wanted to  buy piece goods.  She and I went to Grove in the Springfield wagon. We had a good one. I  can just see those green painted seats. It had springs under the seat, so  when you hit a rock, it didn   t jolt you. It just did this (gestures slight  movement). We didn   t call it fording the river; we just crossed the river.  We were in Grove and then there were wooden walkways and wood  steps out of the stores. As we stepped out, I don   t know who the man  was, but he knew us. Mom knew him, probably.    Rachel,    he said,    are  you over here in the wagon?    She said,    Yes.    He said,    If you expect to  get home like you came, you   re going to have to go right now.    We  didn   t go into another store. We went right to the wagon yard and went  to the river. He said,    The reason why I say that, the river   s on the rise.  They   ve had a big rain upstream.     Well,    upstream    means around the Miami  area , and it took  the  rainwater  a while to get down to Grove.  The Neosho and the Spring  rivers merge to form the Grand so when there would be rainfall in the  areas feeding into the Grand you can very well see the folks downstream  did see the effects for maybe two days or more. So one had to be careful  in deciding the day   s plan if crossing the river was involved.   There wasn   t any signs of anything when we went over, just natural, and  when we got to the river, debris was on top of the river. Mom got out of  the wagon, tied the wagon box down, and you know what I   m talking  about. You always have your ropes to tie your wagon box down. The  wagon box is the wagon. She tied down both sides, and she told me,     Now, you hang on, and you hang steady,    she said. We crossed that  river, debris on the rise, like this. The team swam, and just every little  bit, the wagon rims would hit the rock, and we crossed the river.  33  Finchum  Hammer  Finchum  Hammer  Mom was driving. Mom was twenty-two years older than me, so if she  was twenty-two and I was ten, that made her thirty-two. She was little.  She told me,    Hold steady,    and we made it across. The river is much  wider when it   s on the rise than it is when you cross it to start in with.  Now, I   ll never forget that, my mother and me. We didn   t get ice that  day. We didn   t have an ice route there, but we did here. Ferral was  disappointed she didn   t get her ice. We had homemade ice cream, half a  gallon, just enough for the little family.  How often would you have that?  Oh, anytime we could get any ice, and I mean that pretty regular because  we could cross the river in the summertime. We were closer to Grove  than anybody else. We were practically in Grove   s backyard. It made it  handy when you could drive over the rock and get there, but I don   t want  to go swimming. (Laughter) That   s scary, honey. That   s the last I know  about. I   ve told you the outstanding thing with my mother.  Hold fast and steady, then. Thank you.  That   s what she said.    Hold fast and steady.
