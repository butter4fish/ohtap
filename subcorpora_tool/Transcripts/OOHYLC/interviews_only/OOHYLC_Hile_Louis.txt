Then after I was married I  came back to Kendall School here in Tulsa. I was there about nine  months and then I went back to Peoria, got me a little job in Quapaw in  a machine shop. I worked there for close to a year. Then I went on to  Picher to what   s called Cox Machinery. Finally, I got to be the runner of  it. (Laughs)  Finchum What kind of machinery?

Hile No, I was twenty-three when I got married. My wife was nineteen.  Finchum How   d you meet her?  Hile Church.  Finchum So that would   ve been about Depression time?  Hile It was in the Depression time, and also dust storm days.  Finchum Do you remember anything about those days?  Hile Yes I can.  Finchum Tell us a few.  Hile I   ve seen it so dusty you couldn   t see a quarter of a mile, dust coming  up that little valley to Peoria. Hills, you know, on the north and south, it  just funneled right in there, so dust got pretty bad.  Finchum How would you handle it?  Hile As easy as I could.  Finchum And the Depression?  Hile Depression, I cut wood for a living for sixty-five cents a rick.  7  Finchum You had to do what you had to do.  Hile I done what I had to do, but I have always managed to get something to  eat.

Finchum Were you there when all that was happening?  Hile I was there when the most of it was happening. I   ve been underground a  lot there. My job would take me down where we   d repair the machinery  and things.  Finchum Would you wear any protective mask or anything?  Hile No, no. The air was pretty good only it was under pressure.  Finchum Where did you live there?  Hile I lived about a block from my shop.  Finchum And when you became the owner did you change the name?

Finchum So they kept your wife busy then?  Hile She was well busy.  Finchum Did she work outside of the home?  Hile No.  9  Finchum She had too much to do in the home.  Hile Yeah, she was a home girl.  Finchum Your first house that you lived in with her, what was it like?  Hile It was a little trailer I built on a car frame, just the one room. Had room  for a little bunkbed in one end of it and a little oil stove to cook on in  the other end, and a table where we   d pull out of the wall and turn  down. (Laughs) Well, in about a 5 x 10 you ain   t going to put too much  in it.  Finchum That   s not too big of a space.  Hile We lived just about a mile south of Peoria on a little branch.  Finchum So running water?  Hile Yeah.  Finchum When you were growing up, did you have to do chores around the  house?  Hile They never expected me to do anything. I just done it all on my own.  I   ve cut a lot of wood too, for as little as sixty-five cents a rick.  Bishop How old were you when your mom   you said your mom passed away  early. How old were you?  Hile About nine or ten years old.  Bishop And your dad raised you?  Hile No, my grandmother.  Finchum Your mother   s mother or your dad   s mother?  Hile My dad   s mother.  Bishop Did she live with you?  Hile No. She had a husband of her own, which would   ve been a step-granddad  to me.  Bishop So you were raised by your grandma?  10  Hile Pretty well.  Finchum And what was her name?  Hile Etna Rosetta Cline.  Finchum K-L   well     Hile C-L-I-N-E.  Finchum C, okay.  Bishop Now did she put you to work?  Hile Just doing little odds and ends, but I was idle most of the time running  all over town. (Laughs)  Finchum Would she make your clothes?  Hile Yeah, she seen that I got clothes.  Finchum How often would you get a new pair of shoes?  Hile About every fall.  Finchum For school?  Hile For school.  Finchum What would you pack in your lunch for school?  Hile I came home from school for lunch.  Finchum That was handy   Hile Oh yeah  Peoria was a big town. Population probably 100. (Laughter)  It   s still about like that. No place for it to grow though. Pretty good hills  on each side, just room enough for a stream to run down between the  hills.  Finchum How far is Peoria to Picher?  Hile Fourteen mile.  Finchum So you didn   t move too far from home.  11  Hile No.  Finchum So Picher was a Superfund spot and the government had to come in and  buy out     Hile That was a Superfund that took the town.  Finchum Did they take your part?  Hile Oh yeah, they took mine and I had to move. I moved over to Miami and  just a month later I lost my wife, but she was sick when she left Picher,  but she knowed we had to leave.  Finchum They made you leave?  Hile Yeah, they made us leave.  Bishop Why did they make you leave?  Hile Superfund.  Bishop Superfund.  Finchum It was pollution or     Hile Pollution.  Finchum Pollution. Making people sick?  Hile They claimed it was, but I never seen too much of it.  Bishop You were in the mines   Hile I was on top big part of the time, but a lot of time work took me  underground.  Bishop You ever recall any stories back then of having to go under?  Hile No, I always had pretty good luck. I always went where there was pretty  good air. They   d get the equipment out to where there was good air for  me to work on it. I didn   t have to go back in them big holes. Some of  the holes I worked in covered six, seven acres, and about two-hundred  more feet from the floor to the roof of the  mine .  Finchum Big hole then.  12  Hile Big holes   Finchum How did you learn how to fix machines?  Hile Here in Kendall College.  Finchum Kendall College. I don   t know anything about that one.  Hile It   s been gone for so many years  At that time Harvard was the city  limits of Tulsa.  Finchum Not anymore.  Hile (Laughs) Not anymore. And people settled down in there and they had  big enough space for a garden.  Finchum How did you pay to go to Kendall?  Hile The government paid me. I was in the WPA  Works Progress  Administration .  Finchum What else did they do during that time for you?  Hile Well, I worked on the road a little bit before they sent me down there.  Finchum And how long was the program? A year or     Hile Down here? Yeah.  Finchum About a year?  Hile Yeah, a year. A little less than a year. I   d say about nine months.  Finchum WPA.  Hile WPA.  Finchum Built a lot of sidewalks didn   t they?  Hile Yeah, and little bridges across creeks where hardly anyone ever  crossed. (Laughs)  Finchum I understand they did some bathrooms, outhouses, too, WPA.  Hile Oh yeah. Yeah, outside.  13  Finchum So to do the WPA you had to be so young, you had to be a certain age?  Hile No, people of all ages were on it. They done quite a little roadwork too,  you know, building better roads.  Finchum So you were married when you did that?  Hile Yeah.  Bishop What would you do for fun and entertainment as a kid growing up in  such a small town?  Hile Well, done pretty good. Everybody was pretty friendly. Once in a while  you   d see a fight, but I think that   d be normal in a place like that.  Finchum Did it have a movie house?  Hile No. No, had to draw water out of a well that was about forty-foot deep.  (Laughs)  Finchum Did it have a baseball team?  Hile They did. Even the kids and the men too. Some of the women would  even be out playing baseball.  Bishop Would you ever go to Miami?  Hile It was a long ways, about fourteen mile. That was a little bit far to walk.  Finchum Have a horse and buggy?  Hile No, I never did have a buggy or own a horse. I rode a lot of them, but I  never actually owned any of them.  Finchum Your dad had them?  Hile No.  Bishop What about the trolley? They say there was a trolley between Picher  and Miami. Did you ever ride the trolley?  Hile Oh yes, I rode trolleys from Picher to Miami. I rode the trolleys from  Picher to   doggone it, I can   t think of the name, about sixteen miles up  in Missouri, northeast of Joplin, and I got on the Kansas deal and went  up and around through Coffeyville over to some other town. Then come  14  south to Bartlesville on a streetcar. That streetcar was so slow it took  ten hours for it to make that trip. (Laughs)  Finchum Do you remember how much it cost?  Hile Yeah, a dollar, and that was a lot of money.  Finchum That was a lot.  Hile And then a dollar to come back, but you could go to Joplin on a dime.  Finchum What would you do there?  Hile Practically nothing, (laughs) just see a big town. We called it big. It  wasn   t too big then, but look at the size of it now.  Finchum It   s big, yes. When your wife was having children did she have them at  home?  Hile Yeah. Like myself, didn   t have a doctor. (Laughs)  Finchum Didn   t have a doctor?  Hile No.  Finchum Kind of scary?  Hile No, there was women there to take care of you as good as a doctor  would or better.  Finchum Like a midwife?  Hile Midwife. There was a doctor at Seneca that signed my birth certificate,  but he wasn   t there.  Finchum When they would get sick, where would they go to the doctor?  Hile If they got sick enough, they   d go to Joplin.  Finchum Joplin instead of Tulsa?  Hile Sixteen miles up there.  Finchum Closer to go there than come here?  15  Hile They didn   t think about coming as far as Tulsa. (Laughter) But you  know Vinita made a pretty good town.  Finchum That   s true, it   s a little closer.  Hile Yeah.  Finchum And I think they may have had a hospital too.  Hile The state had a hospital there.  Finchum The mental hospital was there, wasn   t it?  Hile Yeah, mental hospital.  Bishop You said you owned your own shop. Did you have any employees?  Hile Yes. I   ve had as high as seven and eight. Then they bring it up to pay  them minimum wages. Then I had to pay their social security.  Finchum Pretty good boss?  Hile Well I don   t know if I was or not. Heck, two of them wound up being  my sons-in-law. (Laughter)  Finchum Were they all men?  Hile All men, yeah.  Finchum Didn   t hire a woman?  Hile Just my wife.  Finchum Well, you didn   t hire her.  Hile Bookkeeper.  Finchum Oh, bookkeeper. Okay, she kept the numbers.  Hile And two of my daughters made pretty good lathe operators.  Finchum You taught them how?  Hile I taught them how.  Finchum That   s pretty neat.  16  Hile I wound up with some awful big machinery though. The government  furnished it.  Finchum When did you   oh, you had to close when they bought you out?  Hile I closed before they bought me out because the mine went down.  Finchum That would   ve been what? In the     Hile I went down over what was going to happen, you know.  Finchum About what time was that, what year? Do you remember?  Hile I don   t remember right now.  Finchum In the    70s or was it more in the    80s?  Hile In the    80s.  Finchum So it   s been a while.  Hile Been a while.  Finchum How did you end up here in Broken Arrow?  Hile I had a daughter that lived about four blocks over here and after my  wife passed away I was by myself there in just a little rent house. They  come and brought me down here to a little town over here. I can   t call  names anymore     Finchum That   s okay.  Hile    but she brought me down here and had the ice storm. I cleaned up her  place, all that timber fallen and so forth. I don   t know, my daughter  lives over here I think   s the one that got me in here.  Finchum So you were cutting wood in     Hile In the early days before the WPA.  Finchum But when you were cutting and cleaning up her place hopefully she paid  you more than sixty-five cents an hour.  Hile I didn   t charge her nothing. I was getting eats.  17  Finchum Getting eats.  Hile Inola, was the name of the town I come to. She lived out of town there  and had quite a lot of timber around the house. I had a lot to clean up.  (Laughs)  Finchum It was bad, wasn   t it? I remember. That was at 2007, around in there.  The storm came through, the ice storm was in 2007.  Hile About there.  Finchum Right in there.  Hile It was close to that. I   ve been here ever since. I got sick and wound up  in Arizona. I think I was out there about four or five months.  Finchum What was wrong?  Hile I never did know. I didn   t know when I went out there. I do know about  coming back, but I don   t know how I got out there. They just said my  mind completely left me for a while.  Finchum Well you got it back.  Hile I got it back. Only thing was I know I was in an oncology hospital out  there.  Finchum Cancer?  Hile I don   t know what it was. I have a little folder around there for it.  Several of the nurses signed it. It   s hanging on the wall. I can   t tell you  a thing about where it   s at or anything about it. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s okay.  Hile My mind   I just went blank.  Finchum They fixed you and sent you back.  Hile I   ve heard that a doctor gave me the wrong blood medicine. I don   t  know how that could happen.  Finchum I guess it does though, doesn   t it? Did you ever think you   d make it to  100?  18  Hile I never gave it any thought how long I was going to live. I   m the same  way yet, I   ll just be here as long as I can.  Finchum How old was your father when he passed?  Hile About sixty-eight, sixty-nine, somewhere in there.  Finchum And your grandmother that raised you?  Hile She died at about sixty, but that was old for that time.  Finchum Anybody else in your family make it to 100?  Hile My Grandmother Nichols, I don   t know how old she got, but she got  pretty old. I don   t know if she was all old or just give out. You know,  she couldn   t hardly get around.  Finchum What do you think your secret is?  Hile Well, I don   t know. Just luck I guess.  Finchum I think it   s being happy, you   re happy.  Hile Well, I tried to have a lot of fun all the time. I   m still that way. I go  down there early to torment some of the people, (laughs) and they all  know me.  Finchum So they can watch out for you. You play practical jokes?  Hile Practical jokes, yeah. (Laughs)  Finchum How early do you get up?  Hile Usually about five thirty, six o   clock.  Finchum And go to bed?  Hile Nine.  Finchum That   s a pretty long day. What do you do during the day?  Hile I do a lot of walking. I walk up and down these hallways, one end of the  building to the other, and then maybe change it to a different floor. The  beautician   I went to, you know, get my hair cut yesterday, and get my  feet took care of. She got after me because of my feet being calloused,  so I guess I get callouses on my feet. (Laughs)  19  Finchum Keep walking though.  Hile Oh yeah.  Finchum I noticed you work puzzles.  Hile Just little bit at a time. I can work only about fifteen, twenty minutes.  My eyes get to bothering me and I back off.  Finchum That   s a good pastime. Do you read?  Hile Very little anymore.  Finchum When you did, did you read novels or newspapers or what?  Hile I look at that paper every day and go through the sports column.  Bishop Did you ever play sports?  Hile Ball, baseball. I played just a little football. That was too rough for me.  I wasn   t big enough.  Bishop What position did you play in baseball?  Hile All of them. Mostly, though, catcher.  Finchum What do you follow in the newspaper? Baseball?  Hile Yeah, and I watch the football too quite a little bit. Football season   s  here, going to be a going right before very long.  Finchum Who   s your team?  Hile I haven   t picked any. Now in baseball my team is Kansas City Royals  and the Cardinals, St. Louis Cardinals. They   ve been my favorite for  years. Kansas City never did do too good until this year, but St. Louis  has been in the World Series a lot of times.  Finchum Did you ever go to a game?  Hile Yes. Yeah, I   ve seen them both play.  Finchum Cool. I   m a Cincinnati Reds fan.  Hile You are? They do pretty good.  20  Finchum Yeah, sometimes.  Hile Most of the time. They   re better at halfway than they are through. They  win about half of their games.  Finchum So you do keep up   Bishop How important was church growing up?  Hile Oh, it was a must, for quite a while.  Bishop Did your grandmother make you go or your father?  Hile Neither one. I started a going just before we got married. Just started on  my own. The minister of the church, I knew him pretty well. He talked  me into it.  Finchum What church?  Hile Assembly of God, at that time. I go to the Christian now, Cedar Hill.  Finchum After church, when you were younger, would you go back and have  dinner with your grandmother?  Hile Very seldom. I fixed my own dinner many a time.  Finchum What would you fix?  Hile Just anything I could find to fix. (Laughs) I   ve eaten things now that I  wouldn   t of thought of eating back there then.  Finchum Like what?  Hile Like tomatoes for one thing. We thought tomatoes were poison.  Finchum Really? They   re sure good.  Hile Yeah, they are now, but back then they had some kind of poison they  claimed had in them.  Finchum Would you fry chicken?  Hile Oh yeah. I can still fry chicken, and I like chicken yet too.  Finchum Did you raise chickens?  21  Hile Yes.  Finchum So when it was time to kill them, did you do it?  Hile My wife could beat me killing a chicken. She   d get one by the head and  give it a little flip. She had the head and the chicken was out there  flopping somewhere. (Laughs)  Finchum She was better at than you, huh?  Hile Oh, she   s good at it. (Laughs)  Finchum Did she sew? Your wife, did she sew?  Hile She sewed quite a bit, and she was just a pretty good housekeeper. The  kids always had clothes.  Finchum When the kids got in trouble who would punish them?  Hile She did.  Finchum What did she do?  Hile (Laughs) She   d blister them.  Bishop Did you ever take a family vacation? Did you ever travel?  Hile One time. One of the girls, older girls, got married and moved to  Montana. We gathered up, went plumb up there to see her once. Was  kind of rough on the kids going that far, the younger ones.  Finchum That wasn   t in your Model A? You had a different car from your Model  A?  Hile Oh yeah. I had a Chevrolet, and above all it was a Vega. (Laughs)  Finchum A Vega. (Laughter)  Hile I don   t know which one. That was when they made that little four-cylinder  and it proved to be a very poor car. (Laughs)  Finchum I remember those. Was your Model A, when you bought it, a new one or  a used?  Hile Used.  22  Finchum Who taught you how to drive?  Hile I taught myself. I started driving cars when I was about nine years old,  in old T Model Fords.  Finchum Who would let you do that?  Hile My dad.  Finchum Would he? Roads were paved or dirt?  Hile Dirt. I was pretty good sized before I seen my first paved road. The first  hard surface road   I believe it was in Miami. Had laid brick in the  street, had brick streets.  Finchum And learned to change tires on the Model A?  Hile Oh yes. I changed tires on T Models too.  Finchum Had to do it a lot? The inner tubes?  Hile Yeah, inner tubes, I patched them and mounted the tire on the wheel.  Finchum We   ve come a long way, haven   t we?  Hile (Laughs) We sure have.  Finchum What do you think   s been the biggest invention during your life?  Hile The radio.  Finchum Really?  Hile TV, I didn   t think that   d ever work first I   d seen. I was living with some  people and he came in on the start of the TV, and I went to Philadelphia  with him one time to see the first TVs. They   d show the picture a mile  away. It was just   it was nothing like they are now. It just looked flat  you know and wasn   t a lot of moving around. (Laughs)  Bishop You said the radio, do you remember your first radio?  Hile Yeah, they had a whole house of batteries to run it. (Laughter) Then  outside they had a wire stretched across a great big area for the  antennae.  23  Bishop And what would you listen to?  Hile There was only one station you could listen to   Joplin.  Bishop What did they play?  Hile Heck, I don   t remember now. Never did amount to much though. To me  I   m sixteen miles away, I was getting it. It wasn   t very long until they  got to where they   d get a station in Kansas City.  Finchum Then you could listen to baseball   Hile Yeah.  Finchum The TV that you went to see in Philadelphia, how did you come to get to  do that?  Hile It was just on account of the man I was living with.  Finchum He just wanted to go?  Hile He was involved in getting it straightened out and everything. He was a  pretty good electrician.  Finchum So you boarded for a while? Before you got married?  Hile When I was going to school   Finchum Okay. Philadelphia   s a big city.  Hile I don   t remember too much about it. I was pretty young.  Finchum Well, do you remember seeing your first airplane?  Hile Yes I did. I couldn   t figure out how they kept it up in the air that way   (Laughs) It wasn   t but just a few days after I seen it I seen it again on  the ground, nose down. The boy was killed in it.  Finchum So you didn   t want to go?  Hile No, I didn   t care about airplanes from then on. (Laughs)  Bishop Have you ever been on one?  Hile Oh yes, I rode them lately.  24  Finchum To go to Arizona.  Bishop You have anything on your bucket list? Anything you want to do that  you   ve never done before?  Hile I don   t know what it   d be  (Laughs) I   ve done just about as I please all  my life. I was just a little wild boy.  Finchum Little wild?  Bishop Now up in that part of Oklahoma there is a lot of Native Americans,  American Indians, did you ever have any friends or neighbors?  Hile Most of the Indians I was around were pretty nice. The Peoria Tribe of  Indians in Oklahoma   s pretty small.  Bishop Yeah, it   s a small tribe.  Hile And when the Quapaws came to Oklahoma they were pretty small. Of  course the Quapaws, when they separated, some of them went west out  around Bartlesville, changed their name from Quapaw to another name.  You probably got that in history though.  Bishop What was the name?  Hile I can   t tell you right now.  Bishop Delaware? No, it   s not Delaware.  Hile No, it   s not the Delaware. I   d know it if I heard it, because there   s quite  a few up around that neighborhood, though, yet.  Bishop Why   d they separate?  Hile They just had a big battle, separated. Had two chiefs, was the problem.  One of them stayed around Quapaw and the other went out around  Bartlesville.  Bishop I know around that area of Miami they have a lot of little tribes. There   s  the     Hile And they had a lot of tribes.  Bishop    five or six different tribes in Miami and Quapaw and all that area.  Hile Eleven different tribes.  25  Bishop Any of the men ever work for you? Or did you work with them?  Hile I worked with them a little bit. Some of them came from Oregon,  thirteen of them made it to Oklahoma.  Bishop From Oregon?  Hile From Oregon. I don   t remember the tribe now, but I remember some of  the Indians, but they never did really have a tribe here. They were  settled on a little stripe of ground just south of Peoria, about two miles  south. The Peorias always a   they   re scattered over quite a ways from  the Missouri line plum to Miami. Place about three-mile wide. You   ve  probably got it in history down in there.  Bishop I don   t know much about it.  Finchum I don   t know either. You know more than us.  Hile Well I was there. (Laughs)  Finchum You were there. Did you get into any mischief when you were little?  Hile I done a lot of things I shouldn   t have.  Finchum Like what?  Hile Like going swimming.  Finchum Going swimming where?  Hile In the little creek there at Peoria.  Finchum And you weren   t supposed to?  Hile I wasn   t supposed to, but I did.  Finchum Wasn   t very deep.  Hile About two-foot.  Finchum Deep enough to   yeah. For a little kid.  Hile Oh yeah. It didn   t run all the time, it was just a hole you know.  Finchum How would you keep cool in the summer?  26  Hile I   d go down there and go swimming. I wasn   t the only one though  I   ve  seen girls down there the same way.  Finchum Just jump in, huh?  Hile They   ve done worse than that, took their clothes off and jumped in   They didn   t want to get their clothes wet. (Laughs)  Finchum Then they   d get in double-trouble.  Hile They were small though.  Finchum Little kids?  Hile Yeah.  Finchum So no one would be watching you? You   d just sneak off?  Hile Usually some woman back there watched us to see that everything went  all right.  Finchum Small, everybody knew everybody?  Hile Yeah, everybody knew everybody.  Finchum If you lived with your grandmother, did she can?  Hile A lot. She canned a lot.  Finchum Had a big garden?  Hile Pretty good sized. She always had a garden.  Finchum And would she go to the store and buy any groceries?  Hile My grandfather worked out someplace. Generally, she sent me down to  the store with a dime to get a dime   s worth of meat for your dinner  bucket.  Finchum A dime   s worth of meat?  Hile Dime   s worth of meat. (Laughs)  Finchum What kind of meat?  27  Hile Usually always pork.  Finchum How would she fix it?  Hile I think most of it was fried. I went to the store a lot of times and got a  dime   s worth of meat for her. (Laughs)  Finchum Would she make her own bread or would you buy a loaf of bread?  Hile She made her own bread. She raised her own tobacco.  Finchum Raised her own tobacco?  Hile (Laughs) She liked her tobacco.  Finchum To smoke it or chew it?  Hile Both ways. (Laughter)  Bishop Did you ever try some of her tobacco?  Hile I tried it, it made me sick. I quit. (Laughter)  Finchum Was she from Oklahoma?  Hile Yeah.  Finchum She grew up in Oklahoma?  Hile No, I think Pennsylvania   s where she grew up at.  Finchum I was just wondering how she learned to grow tobacco, so     Hile I don   t know.  Finchum I figured Kentucky or Tennessee, those are tobacco states.  Hile She was born in Pennsylvania. She was Dutch, (laughs) she showed it.  Finchum She made good desserts then.  Hile I guess so  Tobacco made awful big leaves, too, that she grew.  Finchum I understand it   s itchy. I think it   s itchy when it gets on you, it itches.  Hile Yeah. She   d cut it and hang it up out in, she called it a smokehouse.  28  Finchum You   d have to let it dry?  Hile Yeah.  Finchum And she would smoke it like a cigarette?  Hile No, it wasn   t a cigarette, it was an old cob pipe.  Finchum That makes more sense.  Hile Corncob hollowed out a little bit. Put another stick in it that had a hole  in it. I don   t    know how she got a hole through that stick she put in it.  She made quite a pipe out of it. (Laughs)  Finchum Would her husband smoke too?  Hile Yeah.  Finchum How many children did they have?  Hile Just Dad and one other boy.  Finchum So two, so a small family.  Hile Small family.  Finchum And then you had six.  Hile I had six.  Finchum You changed that, huh? What did they all end up doing?  Hile Four of them were girls. They   re all four living and doing pretty good.  Finchum All married?  Hile Yeah, they are now because one of them got married just a little over a  year ago. (Laughs) And my boy, he never did get married, the one that  lived. He lives in Quapaw. Last time I seen him he looked like a hermit  (laughs) to me.  Finchum He stayed pretty close to home.  Hile Had a red beard that hung down to his waist. (Laughter)  29  Finchum He stayed close to where he grew up, and did the girls stay close?  Hile No, they separated. The oldest girl   well when she first got married she  went to Colorado, Leadville, Colorado. She finally wound up in Noel,  Missouri. She   s been there now   oh, about the last twenty years. The  one just younger than her, she went to Troy, Montana. She   s still there.  The next one   s right over here at Inola, and the youngest one is just a  few blocks down south here.  Finchum So the youngest one gets to keep tabs on you more?  Hile The one in Inola keeps tabs pretty close.  Finchum Did they fight much growing up? The four girls?  Hile I wasn   t around them enough to know really. You have to give my wife  credit for raising them girls. (Laughs) I was always busy getting  something for them to eat.  Bishop When you weren   t busy, what   d you do with them?  Hile They stayed at home.  Bishop But how would you spend time with them when you had time to spend.  Hile I didn   t spend a whole lot of time with them. Their mother pretty well  growed them up.  Finchum Like on Saturdays and Sundays what would you do with them?  Hile Oh I had a lot of fun with them then.  Finchum What would you do?  Hile Different things. Went to a lot of their school plays and things.  Finchum Played games?  Hile Not too much for games.  Finchum Bicycles?  Hile They had to have them. They had to have them. They pretty well  managed to get them on their own. (Laughs)  Finchum Did they want to work? Did they work?  30  Hile Not very much when they was home. All of them got married pretty  young.  Finchum Did they all have blue eyes like yours?  Hile As far as I know. (Laughter)  Bishop When history is written, what would you like for it to say about you?  How would you like to be remembered, when it   s all said and done?  Hile I had a pretty rough life when I was young, and I think I done pretty  good when I got older and got into the shop. Went to work for an outfit  called Cox Machinery. Worked there a little while. And when I had it  myself I still called it Cox Machinery  Never did change the name.  They had somebody lose their   it was Cox Machinery. I just left it and  used it myself. Never changed the name. So all the history you got on  Cox Machinery, I was there the biggest extent of the time. (Laughs)  Bishop How do you want to be remembered when you   re gone? How do you  want others to think   remember you?  Hile Just as a happy go-lucky boy.  Bishop Happy go-lucky boy.  Hile I   m still just a boy in a way. (Laughter) Just a big boy, got old, and I  figure on a lot of years yet. I looked at the paper they gave me, you  know the 100-year-olds in Oklahoma. I   m going to outlive any of them   Bishop What advice would you give someone that wants to live 100 years?  Hile That would be hard for me to do because I made it so doggone easy so  quick. (Laughter)  Finchum How did you celebrate your birthday?  Hile I had about three days of celebration. On a Saturday we went to a  church deal and all the whole family, a lot of my family, was there. It  was over 100. It was a pretty good long day for me. Then Sunday I went  to church and they had a deal for me there. Then on my birthday I was  here, they come back and there was another big deal  They even took a  picture of me on the Monday down here. One of the aides told me to sit  in a certain place that day. I went and I sat down, there was my picture  right in front of me. (Laughs) A woman in the other room had took a  31  big cake and there I was holding that cake. It   s still down there on the  table. (Laughs)  Finchum Had to blow out a lot of candles in three days.  Hile There wasn   t any candles on it  They didn   t want to burn the cake up.  (Laughter)  Finchum Well you ate a lot of cake then.  Hile But you go down there right now, that picture   s sitting on that table.  Says,    This place is private for Louis Hile     (Laughter)  Finchum You   re in pretty good shape to be 100, aren   t you?  Hile I   m in pretty good shape.  Finchum When did you give up driving?  Hile When I was ninety.  Finchum You just gave it up or     Hile Yeah, I come nearly having an accident. It scared me. I said,    That   s it.     Finchum Here are the keys.  Hile Give my car way.  Finchum What kind was it?  Hile Ninety-five   oh, it was made by Ford, their fancy car. What is it they  call it?  Finchum I don   t know my Fords.  Hile Lincoln  Ninety-five Lincoln.  Finchum A big car, wasn   t a Chevy.  Hile No, it wasn   t a Chevy. It was a Lincoln. It was a Ford product.  Bishop You seem to be a Ford man.  Hile Yeah, I   m pretty much a Ford man. I tried some of them imported cars,  I couldn   t get along with them. They might   ve been good when they  32  was new, but when I got them they was all gone. (Laughter) They   d  already done their job. (Laughter) Your foreign cars now, I noticed they  go down pretty fast. They don   t stand up. They   re good looking to start  with, but you take them after they   re three or four years old and look at  them, they   re about ready for the junk pile. I imagine you   ve noticed it a  little bit.  Finchum A little bit.  Hile And they cost more than the cars that stand up. Actually a Ford, a  Chevrolet, and Dodge are just about the only good cars on the road.  They stood up good.  Finchum Anything else you want to add before we close out?  Hile Nothing I can think about. Only I was just a little poor boy on my own  for a lot of years and made a living. Got to live someway  I never was  actually hungry.  Finchum No, you did good. Would you sing or go to dances?  Hile I never did go to dances, because every dance that I seen they all  wanted to have a fight, and I wasn   t a fighter. (Laughs)  Finchum Just wanted to have fun.  Hile Seemed like around down in that country they get a little drinking then  go to fighting.  Finchum Some things don   t change. All right, well we thank you very much for  talking with us today. It   s been a pleasure.  Hile I didn   t have anything planned.  Finchum Hey, I   m glad   Hile We just had a little visit  (Laughs)  Finchum We did  Thank you   Hile I   m glad you all come.  Finchum All right.  -------  -------
