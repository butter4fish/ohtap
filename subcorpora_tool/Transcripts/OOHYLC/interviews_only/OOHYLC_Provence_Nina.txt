 Finchum, and along with me is Alex Bishop. We   re in  Perkins, Oklahoma, to speak with Nina Provence who is one hundred  years old as of February of this year. So, thank you for having us today.  Our first question to you is when and where you were born?  I was born on Sunday morning in Dublin, Texas, in 1913.  Okay, and then did you live there very long?  I lived there until I was about seven or eight years old. I lived there  during the first war.  And what did your parents do for a living?  That   s a good question. I think he worked in a hardware store.  Okay.  My mother took care of the children. She had a child every two years.  And for the record, how many children did she have?  She bore twelve children, but two of them were stillborn. So, she had ten  living children: five girls and five boys.  And where were you in that order?  Seventh.  Seventh. Okay. And from Texas where did you move?  5  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  To Ada.  Oklahoma.  Yes.  And did you go to school there?  Yes, we came up on a train from Fort Worth. To show you how back-woodsy  we were, my uncle had a brand new Model T Ford, and he was  going to drive us from Dublin to Fort Worth to get on the train. So, we  got to Fort Worth, and he didn   t know the directions, and he got us down  in nigger town, and we were all crying, hungry, you know. So they went  off to get us something to eat and left my older sister in charge of us in  the car, the Model T car. Well, we thought they were gone forever. We  were little children, you know? We all sat up crying, and I remember  that,    They   d get lost in Fort Worth, and we   d never see them again.     Well, the train came about, maybe, nine o   clock, and we got into Ada  about two o    clock that next morning. All of us piled in the train and  came up to Ada. My uncle met us at the station. It was about twelve  o   clock when we got off the train.  A long trip.  We lived in Ada. I lived in Ada for fifteen or sixteen years. And then I  went to   I got married. Smarty me  (Pats chest) I moved to Wetumka,  and I lived in Beggs and lived in California. I   ve lived in Texas. I   ve  lived in Oklahoma. I   ve lived everywhere. I started working, when I was  about sixteen years old, in a movie house. I sold tickets at the movie  house. And we  my husband and I  moved then to Beggs. Do you know  where Beggs is?  Yes.  That   s where Carl was born, in Beggs. We lived there for I don   t know  how many years. Carl was a very big boy when we moved, and Jim  started school in Beggs. I lacked three credits finishing high school  when I was fifteen years old, and I took them by correspondence from  the University of Oklahoma in Norman. I made a hundred on the final  test.  Good for you   So, all I have is a high school education, but I   ve lived everywhere,  nearly, and I   ve done everything. I   ve worked in a dry-goods store. I  worked in a dress shop. I worked in the post office all during the war,  6  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  the  second  war. I worked in the post office, and every time a man was  called to service, I took his place and moved up. My title was secretary  to the postmaster, but I   ve done every job in the post office, even carried  the mail. I   ve worked in dry goods. I   ve worked in everywhere and  everything. I used to sing a lot, and I used to play the piano. I played  with four in a piano group in Stillwater. It   s been about fifteen years ago,  ten or fifteen years ago. We had a music club in Stillwater, and there  were four of us that worked together and made an ensemble, and we put  on programs at different times in Stillwater.  Who taught you to play the piano? How did you learn to play the piano?  I cooked and washed dishes. I was about twelve or thirteen years old,  and we had an old wrecked piano. It didn   t have half the notes. Half the  notes didn   t play, but I played what I could on it by ear. Finally, my  mother decided I needed some piano lessons. My daddy had a mattress  factory, and they made over a mattress for this teacher, and I took it out  in lessons. And then I had took voice lessons from Wade   what was his  name? The head of the music department at Oklahoma State?  I   m not sure.  What was his name? I took voice lessons from him, and I sang  everywhere, every place. We organized a group that went from  Stillwater to Muskogee once a week and sang for the Veterans Hospital  in Muskogee. And when they built that annex in Okmulgee   OSU has  an annex in Okmulgee, you know? Well I worked there about five years,  and I worked first in the news department, how to make a newspaper.  They taught that sort of thing, you know. Then I worked for the  engineers, and I worked on the Will Rogers project. I helped Dr.   Theodore Agnew . He set up the project at OSU, that Will Rogers  project.  Dr. Agnew?  Dr. Agnew. And I worked in the domestic arts department there for a  little while. Nobody could get along with her though, so we had a  disagreement, and I went somewhere else. I worked on a project, grant,  from the government on wastewater for farmers. I worked about a year  on that, and I worked in a dress shop. I worked in a dry-goods store. I   ve  worked everywhere. I   ve done everything.  You worked all the time  Well, when you were a little girl living in Ada,  do you have any favorite memories?  From when I was a little girl?  7  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  In Ada, yes.  Yes, during the First World War the first airplane that they had, first  successful airplane, was going from, I guess, Washington, or I don   t  know where it was coming from, but it was passing over Ada and going  to Los Angeles or San Francisco in California. So they turned out school  to see that airplane go over. I saw the first airplane that went over. It was  in the first of the war. Carl was in the second war. He was stationed in  France. He was lieutenant in the air force in France. And, let me see,  what else?  Well, when you got married at fifteen, how did you meet your husband?  He lived across the street.  You didn   t have to go far then.  No. (Laughs)  How did you come to have a job at the post office?  How come I had a job at the post office? Well, they were drafting men  for the war. The first job I got was in the postmaster   s office, and I did  the quarterly reports, and I counted stamps, and I worked in the  windows, and I worked in the money orders department. I delivered  special delivery mail. I did everything.  Were there very many women doing that with you?  Nobody.  Nobody?  I was the only woman that worked in the post office, and every time a  boy in line would get drafted, see, I would move into his job. And when  he   d get drafted, why, I would move into the next job, so I   ve done  every job in the post office.  That   s pretty impressive. I understand you were in Dallas when  President Kennedy was shot? You want to talk a little about that?  I was working for Acme Brick Company in, not in Dallas, but in   yes, I  guess it was Dallas, too. Anyway, I was office manager for the Acme  Brick Company in  Denton . Let me think a minute. Anyway, our men, a  lot them worked at the brick plant but they all went out to lunch one day  8  Finchum  Provence  and I was in the office. The head salesman was Bob Oswald. Lee Harvey  Oswald was his brother. So, it was only Bob and me left in the office  when he  President Kennedy  was shot. So, when I came back from  lunch he said that the president had been shot, and we all crowded up to  the window, of course, to see what we could see, and we looked out on  this crowd of people there and all the activity was going on. The  governor of Texas was wounded in his arm, I think, and, of course, they  just dropped everything and took him  President Kennedy  to the  hospital. He was dead before they got him off the street. They picked up  the back of his skull out of the street.  So when the administration and all of our staff came back they were all  joking about Johnson couldn   t go hunting because he couldn   t get his  rifle back from Lee Harvey, a joke. And he  Bob  was standing behind  my desk. Silence. One of them said it came over the radio that they  suspected that Lee Harvey Oswald had shot him and that they were  looking for him. He had run away, and they were looking for him. So,  when I looked back at him he was whiter than your shirt, and he just put  his hands up on his head, and he said    Oh my God, this is my brother.        Well, pretty soon the FBI was swarming our office. I had to write a  deposition, a paper, on what I was doing when this happened. I wrote six  pages I think, typed pages, of where I was, what I saw and what I heard.  I had two escorts of FBI. After everything settled down and after Lee  Harvey was killed, they came and asked me for everything I knew about  it, and I told them everything I knew about it, how I learned in the office  that he was killed. I saw the crowd from the window, and he said,     You   ll have to have an escort for at least two weeks.     Just for your safety?  Be under surveillance for just a few weeks. He stayed in my office. I  was the office manager for the Acme Brick Company in Denton, Texas,  and they took that five or six pages I typed and took it to Washington.  I went to Europe in    73. I went to a conference over there, and I stayed  twenty-one days in London, and I had it all written out in a chronicle. I  had a notebook and I wrote where we went and what we did and what  we saw and what happened. And when I came out here, why, they got in  my room one night and just scattered it everywhere. I hadn   t gotten it all  together again yet, but I stayed in London twenty-one days. I went to the  palace. I flew from Los Angeles. I was living in Pasadena then, and we  flew from Los Angeles. We left Los Angeles at seven o   clock one night  and got into London at seven o   clock the next morning to Heathrow  Airport, and we went to our rooms, but they weren   t ready. You   d be  surprised how backward they are over there. (Laughs)  9  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  So, we went down to Buckingham Palace. It was only about six blocks.  Oh, it wasn   t that much. It was about three blocks down from our hotel.  St. James is where we stayed, and we stood there and watched the  changing of the guard for the palace. They had a dog with them. He  looked like a collie. He was about this tall, and whenever they   d stand  at attention, that dog would stand at attention, front feet out like that.  They went through all this ceremony for the changing of the guard. I   ve  been to Buckingham Palace. I   ve been to, what   s the one down on the  Thames? Oh, can   t think of the name of it now, but it   s on the Thames.  It was a good trip or you.  Yes, it was a big trip for me, and I bought some sweaters, some Scottish  sweaters for my children in England. I bought a lot of, I bought some     well, what   s the famous glass they make in England?  I   ve not been. So, I don   t know.  I can   t think of that.  Well, after the Kennedy assassination, did you move back to Oklahoma  at that point? From Denton, Texas, did you come back to Oklahoma?  Yes, after I lived in Texas. I lived in Denton in Texas. That   s about  twelve or fourteen miles from Fort Worth.  Back in the   60s?  Yes. Carl graduated from college, and he set up an insurance office in  Denton. He had two little children. One of his children was born in  France, and that one was about six or eight months old, and I was  babysitter, more than anything else. We both lived in Denton, and what  did I do in Denton? That   s where I worked for Acme? No, Acme was in  Denton. Anyway, we lived in Denton for a little while. I can   t think of  anything exciting that happened in Denton. I just worked.  Just worked. Now what brought you to Oklahoma the second time?  Carl.  Carl.  He graduated from the college up here and set up a business in  Stillwater, and he said,    Why don   t you move up here, Mother, where  we can look after you?    So I moved up to Stillwater. I lived in Stillwater  10  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  five years.  So that would   ve been a little later. Where were you during the  Depression?  During the Depression?  Yes.  Doing the best I could I imagine. I think I lived in Mansfield, Texas,  because I saw them trekking across to go to California, wagons leaving  Oklahoma, going across. I don   t know much about the Depression, only  that we never had anything. We didn   t have any money. We were just  hand-to-mouth. We had a Sunday dress and a school dress and one to  wash. We wore one and washed one and wore one and washed one.  That   s how poor we were.  Were they made out of flour sacks?  No, we had gingham dresses. My aunt was a seamstress, and she made  our dresses for us, and I started to school in Ada.  In a one-room schoolhouse?  No, I started in a regular schoolhouse, but I started in the second grade  because I had read my older sister   s books as she brought them home. I  followed her through the first grade, and I stayed in the second grade for  I don   t know how many months. Then I got promoted to the third grade  due to big tests. They pushed me over into the fourth grade, and I spent  all of my grade school time in the public schools in Ada. I went to  Willard School, and I had a lot of adventures there. (Laughs)  Like what?  I went to high school in Ada. I finished high school when I was fifteen  years old. And oh, by the way, my teacher   s name when I was in the  fourth grade was Edwards. Do you remember Edwards that broadcast  over the radio? He broadcasted the news? Well, it was his mother that  taught me in the fourth grade. Well, I was so far ahead in the fourth  grade that she promoted me to the fifth grade and gave me time off to  take care for a little boy out on the playground. Oh, that   s not very  interesting.  Was your sister jealous that you were as smart as she was? Was your  sister jealous because you knew as much as she did?  11  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Yes, two of them were, but ordinarily I got along better with my brothers  than I did with my sisters.  That happens.  But we had to work when we were growing up because it was in the  Depression, you know. I remember the first automobile I ever saw.  Tell us about that.  Well, it was right after the war and the boys came back from France, and  my sister   s sweetheart was one of the boys who came back from France.  He brought her a French blouse that was cr  pe de Chine. Do you know  what cr  pe de Chine is? Embroidered all across the front, he bought it in  Paris. My daddy wouldn   t let her wear it. (Laughs) You could see  through it. He wouldn   t let her wear it, but she wore it nevertheless. And  I remember I was about six years old, I imagine. She had a friend that  lived over the railroad track from where we lived, and she would take  that in a bundle if she was going someplace she needed to wear it. I  would walk with her up there to the railroad, and she would walk on to  her friend   s house and change into her blouse and go to her party and  then come back and change back into her blouse and walk home. Well,  Dad finally caught on to that, so I think he burnt the blouse. I don   t  remember what he did with it, but he wouldn   t let her wear it. And her  friend bought a Model T Ford. It was the first car I ever saw, and when  he would drive that down the street everybody would run out in the yard  to see that car coming down the street. Nobody in it, just one person  driving it down the street. Marvelous  Marvelous  I don   t remember too  much about that.  I remember my grandfather. My Grandfather Smith, he lived in Dublin,  and he took me one day when I was a little girl (I must   ve been five or  six years old) up on the hill, and there was a cherry tree, and it had ripe  fruit and green fruit both on it, and he took me up there to see it. We  lived in Dublin. We had a windmill for water, and it was up on the hill.  We had to go up and get the water in a bucket and carry it back down.  Our great-grandmother, who we all hated with a passion, would come to  see us, and she dipped snuff. We had to run and find Grandma a can to  spit in. And we all just hated Grandma, so one day when she got    she  was one of these grandmothers who would say,    Now if I was you, I  would do this, that and the other    with the children, you know, so all the  children hated her. One day she told Mamma that she had to have a fresh  drink of water out of that well up there on the hill, from the windmill,  and to make my oldest cousin and my oldest sister go up and bring her  fresh water from the hill. So, they were very chagrined, of course, at  having to go get Grandma a drink so they both spit in it before they got  12  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  home. (Laughs)  I had a bunch of cousins, and let   s see if I got any cousins that did  anything. They all had big families, all of them. I don   t remember much  about that.  What were holidays like when you were little?  Holiday time?  Yes.  You mean Christmas? My mother made us a doll out of canvas, made a  body and put a head on it, and that was our doll, and I think one year I  got a little doll buggy. I can remember pushing that doll around in the  doll buggy. I remember one time when I was laying out on the back  porch   oh, my brothers would get in a grass fight and there was an  empty house down just a walk from where we lived, and they had a big  grass fight down there in the grass. Bermuda grass was that high,  (gestures twelve inches) and I went down, of course, to help my favorite  brother. I had a pinafore on, and I gathered it up like this (gestures  cupping fabric) full of grass to take to him for ammunition, and I  stepped on a bottle and cut a gash in my foot just like that in the arch of  my foot. They made a back saddle like this (gestures crossing arms) and  took me back up to the house, and my mother immediately put my foot  in a pan of gasoline. That was the remedy. I was bleeding like a stuck  horse. (Laughs)  Did it work?  I got a scar that big, you know, in the arch of my right foot. We played  down in that house. We played next to a cotton field. We   d play house  out there and mark off our houses. We   d cook with mud and cotton  leaves and everything. We had a good time. We thought we was all  right. We had to carry water to the house. We had a sewer connection  but it was on the alley, and my daddy   s factory was off, he manufactured  mattresses, and we lived down on Twelfth Street.  And you got married when you were fifteen?  I   d lacked a month being sixteen years old when I got married.  What was the rush?  I don   t know. All of a sudden I knew I was married. My mother and the  woman across the street arranged it. I didn   t know I was going to get  13  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Bishop  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  married until they told me. That   s the way to get rid of one of your kids.  It wasn   t a successful marriage.  But you had two good sons from it.  Huh?  You had two good sons from it.  Yes, I did but he   s been dead ten years. That   s about all I can think of to  tell you. I could tell you all more way into the night but you wouldn   t  want to listen to it.  Well, we   ll see.  Well, you   re a hundred. What   s your secret?  What   s my secret?  For living so long?  Well, I don   t know that I have a secret. We ate common, ordinary food.  We had steak and gravy and biscuits a lot. We raised a garden, and we  went out and picked wild greens. And we went out in the fall and picked  hickory nuts. Do you know what hickory nuts are?  I do.  You had to hammer them to get in them.  They   re really hard.  We   d take Sunday afternoon and go down towards Sulphur  Oklahoma .  There were hickory trees down there, and the nuts would be on the  ground, and we   d pick up nuts on Sunday afternoon. My oldest brother  was my favorite brother, and I spent many hours sitting on a concrete  sidewalk cracking hickory nuts, picking them out for him because I  loved him so. (Laughs).  Did you exercise much?  What did I exercise on?  Yes.  Well, I had a friend who had a pair of skates and she would come. I  14  Finchum  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Finchum  Provence  would skate on one, and she   d skate on one, and we skated up and down  the sidewalk. We   d run races. We   d have wrestling matches. Oh, I don   t  know. When you   ve got five brothers, you get plenty of exercise.  Well, after you got married, what kind of exercise? And as you got older,  did you do much?  Well, I moved away. I moved up to Beggs, and I don   t know what year  it was. My husband was an operator for the movies. He ran the movies,  and I sold the tickets, and we lived there about two years. I don   t know  of anything exciting that happened there. It was dull. Oh, I learned to  sew.  The last time I visited, you told me about California, being in an  earthquake. Could you talk a little bit about that? The earthquake you  were in?  When did I tell you about that? This morning?  Last week.  Oh  That   s a time I was scared almost to death. I was asleep when it  happened. It happened at six o   clock in the morning. I had a window  about half as big as that, about as big as one of those windows by my  bed. And the rattling of the window woke me up, and I woke, and I got  up, and that window was going like this (gestures shaking). I thought,     Oh my lands, we   re having an earthquake.    So I tried to think of  what  to do.  You know in  Oklahoma , they broadcast all the time what to do  in a tornado or a flood, what to do. But in California, they broadcast  what to do in an earthquake. So, I went to the door facing and braced  myself in the door facing and looking right into my furnace and I said     Oh  This is not the place to be     So, I ran over to the kitchen, and I  placed my hands down and braced myself in the doorway, and I was  looking right into the hot water tank, and I said,    This is not the place      So, I ran back into the living room, and my piano was just going across  the room just like this, like somebody was pushing it.  So, I thought,    Well, I don   t know what else to do.    So, I went in and sat  down on the bed and began praying that my house wouldn   t cave in on  me, and I thought,    Well, I   ll call my boss and tell him where I am and I  can   t come to work yet.    So, I went to the telephone and called him and  put in a long-distance call to Ada. I got my sister and told her we were  having an earthquake but I was all right, and they cut us off, and we  didn   t have any more communication with her at all. And he said,    Well,  let me tell you what to do. You put on your coat.    It was cold. He said,     You put on your coat and get your purse and go sit on the end of the  15   bench . It   s right next to the door.    And he said,    If it looks like the  ceiling   s going to fall in, go out the door. You   ll be all right.    I said,     Ok.    By then I didn   t know what to do so I just did what he said to do,  but my pictures are all shaking on the wall. My dishes were right out to  the edge, that far from the edge (gestures about an inch). One of my  pictures fell off the wall, and I said    Oh well, to heck with it,    and I just  sat there for a few minutes.  It didn   t look like the roof was going to cave in, so I went outside to see  what happened outside, and as I walked out I could see the high lines,  the hot high lines, the electric lines across. I said,    Oh  This is not the  place to be either     So, I went back in to the house and sat down and  finally collected myself, and I decided there wasn   t any reason for me to  sit there. It only lasted about five or six minutes, you know. The  earthquakes were not more than ten minutes, but I was scared to death.  Finally I said,    Well, to heck with it.    So I put my coat on and picked up  my purse and walked out the door. Down on the corner from where I  lived was a liquor shop. I mean a big liquor shop, too. They had liquor  all over the place. I walked down that way, and they were all out in the  floor. The bottles had all fallen off the shelf and were on the floor.  I finally got up the nerve to get in my car and go up to where I was  working. I was working at a college out there, and it was a modernistic  building that had been built on pillars, you know, like they did to  modernistic buildings. The pillars were about this wide, (gestures open  arms) and they went from ceiling to the floor. When I got there and saw  that building leaning over like that I thought,    Oh, look at that.    So, I  went on upstairs, and when I got in my room, my desk was turned over,  and my boss    desk, (he had a great big, beautiful mahogany desk, heavy  as a truck) it was turned over, and all of the stuff was piled out on the  floor, papers scattered everywhere. So, I took the morning off to cry. So  I cried most of the morning. I was so nervous I didn   t know what to do.  The aftershocks were as hard as the earthquake. I had a concrete porch  on the back of my apartment about that thick, (gestures) and it was  cracked right down the middle. I lived on the edge of what they call the  bayou. There   s a river that runs through Pasadena. What happened to  that river? Anyway, something happened. I finally got to work. I got  back in my office, but I couldn   t work. I was too nervous, and finally I  got settled down a little bit. Pasadena is built on the side of a mountain.  You know, the mountain comes down like this in Pasadena. It   s built  down here, and the houses, some didn   t have roofs on them, and some of  them had posts knocked out, and some of the stores, all of the goods  were piled out on the floor. I got to the office, and I looked out. Our  gymnasium was a very modernistic building. It had an all-glass front,  and that was laying out on the ground. The house up on the hill didn   t  16  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  have any front porch or any roof on it, so I think it just missed me for the  day. I can   t remember what happened for the rest of the day. I was  sitting like this, and every so often it goes (gestures a ripple) and the  chair would move over this way, and it   ll move over that way. Every  time, it   s like a big truck goes by your house. There was a man that got  buried underneath a building. The building collapsed on him, a big  building. He was fourteen days under there before they got him out, and  he lived. The building just shook down. Oh, I had a lot of experiences in  California, I tell you.  How did you come to be in California?  I went out there to work in this college out there.  Just to go?  Well, it was connected with this other college that I had worked at.  Okay.  It was connected with my work here, and I decided I wanted to go to  California. I had visited out in California, and I thought it was so  beautiful. The flowers were so pretty and so warm and everything. The  fruit was so good, grapefruit that big, (gestures) and oranges that big  (gestures). The vegetables were just lovely, and I thought,    I   d kind of  like to live out there.    So I made an application to the college out there,  and they sent for me, and I moved out there.  And how long were you there?  I lived there three years, I think, two or three years. But every time  before the big earthquake came, you   d be sitting in your living room in a  chair, and all of a sudden you   d just jump up and down like someone  had just jerked you up and down, like a big truck just passed by. That   s  aftershocks. We had aftershocks for, oh, I don   t know, a month or so,  but they got buildings out there that are seven and eight stories tall, and  you get up there by an elevator, of course. Well, we couldn   t use the  elevator so we had to walk up the stairs to get to our offices. What  excited me most was my boss    desk. He had a desk about that wide, and  it was about that wide and that long, (gestures) and it was solid  mahogany, and of course you couldn   t lift it up by yourself. It took ten  men to lift it. Well, it was lying over on its side.  Pretty strong quake.  I didn   t work any that day. I went back to my house. My house wasn   t  17  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  damaged too much, but the porch was split, of course, and I think one of  the windows was broken out. I was scared to death.  No injuries?  No.  No.  No. Well, they had some injuries.  No, for you.  Not for me. No. I went outside. I couldn   t picture myself under a  crumbled house.  Throughout your lifetime, have you had any injuries?  Do what?  As long as you   ve lived, have you had any injuries?  Oh, yes. Yes, I did. I   ve had injuries since I came to Stillwater. I worked  in the college in Stillwater for I don   t know how long, four or five years.  Oh, you know where you go from Stillwater to, from Perkins out to  where you turn to go to Stillwater? The big brick house on the south  side, that   s where I lived. I was working in my garden, and I had a man  working for me. He mowed my yard, and we had pruned some trees. I  had a gorgeous, beautiful yard with   what are these trees that bloom?  Magnolia. I had magnolia trees and redbuds. It was beautiful. People  would stop on the street to look at it.  So I was walking along behind him, picking up trash he had dropped. He  was taking it to his pick-up, and I stepped on something. I never will  know what it was. I had a brick walk, and the brick was set in like this,  and I stepped on something and fell and broke my leg. Broke this leg.  Well, I couldn   t get up. He came back. He was getting ready to leave. I  hollered at him, and he got out and came back to help me. I couldn   t  stand up, of course. He put me in my walker. I was walking. I don   t  know why I was in the walker, but anyway, I was out there working.  And, of course, he called Carl  Jr.  and by the time Carl got there, why,  it was terrible, and they called an ambulance and took me to the hospital.  They x-rayed my leg and said it was broken and they   d have to set it. I  spent fifteen days in the hospital.  In the meantime   fifteen days I stayed in the hospital. I went back to my  18  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Bishop  home, and I lived in my home five years. I had a gorgeous, beautiful  home. You can tell by the furniture I   ve got and the pictures I   ve got,  and I was happy as I could be there. Had big oak trees out in the front.  You know where it is? Well, anyway, I never could do much after I  came back, so after I got out of the hospital Carl moved me down to  Grace. You know where that is?  I do.  It   s a nigger place. All niggers down there. That was an experience, and  I was there for rehabilitation for my broken leg, you see. So I got to  where I could walk with a walker, and I went down to the    I had an  appointment with the head of the rehabilitation center there. He didn   t  know his head from a hole in the ground, and so when I got down to the  office    I got tired doing exercises like this and like this, like this  (gestures barely moving), like second graders, you know. And there was  a big bar, exercise, where you go up and down across a platform about  this tall, over on the side, and I asked the director if I could go up there  and exercise on that exercise bar, and he said,    Sure. Go ahead.    So I  went gaily up there and got ahold of it and went down, and when I came  up, the whole thing came loose and fell down on my legs, crushed both  of my legs, both of my hips.  So back to the hospital?  I don   t remember anything. Just next thing I remember I was in the  hospital. They called Carl and they told him   they picked me up and  took me up to my room and told the head nurse that they found me there,  where I had fallen. Can you imagine anybody that was cut up like that,  that had fallen? Well, the ambulance was there by that time, and they  took me to the hospital, and I was in there fifteen days in the hospital,  and they operated on me and put metal in my legs. I   ve got metal in my  legs.  And you   re getting around pretty good.  I walk pretty well.  You do.  They said I   d never walk again, but I did  Don   t ever tell me I can   t ever  do anything again.  I want to know when things get difficult like that, what do you do to keep  going?  19  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  What I do to keep going?  What gives you the will to live?  Well, I had a house to keep, and I had a person that came and helped me  keep my house for a while. I sewed a lot. I made all my clothes, and for  other people, too. I don   t know. I just worked all the time, and I got  around pretty good on a walker. After a while, when I got to where I  could walk, I worked in my garden and did sewing and played the piano.  What would you say today?  What?  Today what is your philosophy of life? What motto? What   s your motto?  What   s my life feel like today?  What   s your philosophy on life?  What   s your philosophy on life?  Do the best you can. I   ve always been strong. I   ve been near-drowned  once. (Laughs) When I was ten years old I fell into the swimming pool,  and when they found me I was floating on top of the water.  And can you swim?  Sure, I can swim  I can   t dive very well. When I look down into that  water, I can   t dive into it. So, if I can walk into it I can swim, but that   s  neither here nor there.  Did you ever think you   d live to be a hundred?  I never did think about it. I just lived the best I could every year. I   ve  had all kinds of diseases. (Laughs)  Well, when you wake up in the morning, what   s the first thing you think  of?  Get up out of my bed.  Just get up and keep moving.  I have to have help to get out of my bed. I can   t stand on my feet, just  jump out. My legs give way if I just jump out. The nurse pulls my feet  20  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  out, and I get my feet firmly on the floor, and I can stand up. She raises  me up out of the bed, and I go into the bathroom and use the toilet and  put my clothes on. I already have my clothes laying out that I   m going to  wear, and she dresses me in there. I can dress myself to a point, but I  can   t dress myself if I have to pull things up. I   ve got a bar back there  that I hold on to, steady bar, and most of the time I   ll be in the bathroom  by the time they get here. They take fifteen or twenty minutes before  they get here, and if I   m in too big a hurry, as I can   t stay on my bed I  can manage to get up and get in the bathroom and do what I need to do  first: use the toilet. Then I have to gather my panties and everything. She  dresses me in the bathroom. Then we gather up for breakfast and go  down to the dining room.  What do you find meaningful and fulfilling?  Do what?  What do you find meaningful and fulfilling in your day?  How do you pass the time during the day?  I read, and I sew by hand. I can   t crochet yet, but I   ve crocheted a jacket,  not since I   ve been hurt. I did that before I got hurt, but I   ve done all  kinds of sewing. I   ve got all the equipment you have to have to set up a  dress shop, and, oh, I don   t know. I do various things.  Do you read?  Can I read?  Do you read the newspaper every day?  Sometimes. Sometimes it   s not worth reading. (Laughs)  What types of books do you like?  What, honey?  What types of books do you like to read?  Oh, I read the Reader   s Digest and the Weekly, the week. That   s what I  read over there. I read the Bible. I read the Bible a lot.  Are there any core beliefs that you live by? Do you have any beliefs that  you live by?  21  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Finchum  Bishop  Provence  I gotten to where I can   t see too well, and I can   t read my Bible now. I  have to read with a magnifying glass. Carl   s looking for me a big-print  Bible but    Oh, I manage to pass the time. I listen to the television a lot.  I   ve got some favorite programs I like to listen to. I thought I would  embroidery, but I can   t hold a needle. My hands have been ruined. This  nigger woman that dispensed the medicine over at Grace thought she  was a doctor, and she misunderstood what Dr. Green told her to do about  taking blood out of the ends of my fingers. So, she decided to prick my  fingers twice a day with a needle that long, (gestures) and she did.  Finally, I told her I wasn   t going to let her do it, and she called a nigger  boy in there, and he pried my hands open, and she did it anyway. I don   t  know how long she did it, several weeks or months. My hands were  dead by the time I   I don   t have any feeling in the ends of my fingers,  but I   ve gotten nearly all of the dead nails off. Sometimes that finger  will drop down, and it cramps back. See, like that. So I can   t play the  piano to do any good.  When you think about your life, what do you want to be remembered  for?  What do I want to do with what?  What do you want others to remember? How do you want them to  remember you?  Look under there. Is there a box under there?  No, it   s just a Bible. A basket.  Is there not a box under there? I   ve got some cards I want you to look at.  Look at this. Read some of them. That   ll tell you what people think of  me.  How do you want others to remember you?  How do I want others to remember me?  Yes.  Oh, read the cards. (Laughs)  As a strong, independent woman?  A good mother?  I   ve got cards from people I didn   t even know. I didn   t even recognize  22  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  them. I got two boxes full of cards for my birthday.  I should say, what do you think your legacy will be?  Think my legacy will be?  Yes.  That I was a good Christian person. I believe in God, and I obey him. I  don   t lie, and I don   t cheat. I don   t take his name in vain. I read his  book, and I do what it tells me to do in his book. I think I   ll be all right.  (Laughs)  A lot of cards about being a good mother  Read some of them. That   ll tell you what people thought of me.     We love you very much and indeed are lucky to have a mother like  you.     That   s my baby, Jim. He lives in Dallas.  You   ve had a very good life?  All in all, I have. I had to work for it, but I   ve done pretty good, I  thought. I took care of myself when I didn   t know what to do, to raise  the children. I   ve always been one to do what has to be done. I was just  thinking this last baby that my grandson had, little girl, is named for me.  Her name is Nina Lea, and I was thinking about making her something. I  could make it by hand if I could work my fingers but I can   t work my  fingers. I can   t grasp anything. I can   t pick anything up off of the floor  to do any good. I dropped the     Your hearing aid?  Yeah, I drop the batteries, sometimes, out of my hearing aids, and I can   t  pick them up off of the floor. I can   t pick up a needle or anything like  that. I haven   t tried to knit since my hands have got well. That   s been  over two years that the ends of my fingers were just dead. My  fingernails all came off. I got pretty good fingernails now. The nurses  filed all the dead stuff off.  Well, you   re in a better place now.  Am I in a better place? Well that depends. I get awfully angry  sometimes at Carl, but there   s not anything I can do about it.  23  Bishop  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Bishop  Provence  What do you find most satisfying about life today?  I tell you what happened. When I broke my leg I went into the hospital,  as I told you, for fifteen days, and I signed a power of attorney for Carl  to take care of my business while I was in there. He evidently thought  that I turned everything over to him, so he treats me like a little girl, that  I don   t have any business sense. He won   t let me handle any money. I  had this house there on Eleventh Street. I had beautiful, beautiful  furniture. I had everything I wanted in that house. I was happy there, and  when I got in the hospital all of a sudden I was told that   do you know  Paige?  No.  Paige Provence.  I don   t know her. I know who she is, but I don   t know her.  Well, I think she engineered this, but anyway. Carl and Jim, Jim was  living in my house while I was in the hospital, and he was waiting on a  contract with this company he was working with, and so I didn   t pay any  attention to what they were doing to my house. All of a sudden I realized  Carl had given away all of my furniture. I gave him power of attorney,  and he throws that down in front of me every time I protest to his  granddaughter who lived in Texas. Her husband is an electrician, and  they were barely making a living in Texas, and her mother engineered  moving her up here and letting her live in my house. She had a four-year-  old son. He   s as wild as a March hare. They   re trying to make a  cowboy out of him, as you can see by the picture that I have of him.  They   ve got him on a horse.  Anyway, I didn   t know a single thing about it until they had moved all  of my furniture out of my house. I   ve got a twin bedroom suit that  cannot be replaced at any price. It is solid Honduras mahogany, four-poster  twin beds. She let him jump up and down on my bed until he  broke the springs in my mattress.    Ride    em cowboy  Ride    em  cowboy     That   s the kind of mentality she is. They lived in my house for  two months, and I didn   t even know that they were living there. How do  you like that? How   d you like to walk in your house after you   d been in  the hospital fifteen days and see all of your furniture gone?  That would be difficult.  Well, I had a fit about it, of course, but that didn   t help any, and Carl  treats me like I   m senile. He treats me like a baby, you know, by the way  24  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Bishop  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Bishop  Finchum  he butted in here and answered all the questions and everything like I  couldn   t understand what you were saying. And he   s told everybody I  don   t know the difference between daylight and dark, that I imagine  things like I think I   m somewhere else. I never once in my life thought  that I was somewhere else. My house is sitting empty down there. I tried  and tried and tried to get him to move me back into my house. I can hire  somebody to help me do my washing. I can hire somebody to clean my  floor. I can hire somebody to come and help me.  What gives you a sense of hope?  What?  How do you find hope?  How do I find hope?  Yeah.  Oh, I don   t imagine I   ll ever live in my beautiful home again. She took  all my furniture. Can you imagine anybody who has been married five  years that don   t have any dishes, don   t have any pots and pans, don   t  have any furniture? They don   t have anything but a car, and it was my  car that I gave her. They came in and slipped her in there, took all my  furniture and moved it out to another house. That   s where she lives now.  She   s got two children now. She don   t know anything, just to take  pictures and have babies. She don   t know how to sew. She don   t know  how to cook. She don   t know how to manage anything.  It   s just a different generation.  They live on hamburgers and pizza, I   m sure. She didn   t even have any  dishtowels. She took everything I had in my house.  I   m sorry about that but     I   m sorry about it, too. That   s the only thing that gets me down. That   s  the only thing that works me up. It   s what they did, and they did it all  secretly, see? And he tells everybody, to cover it up, that I   m senile, that  I don   t know how to take care of myself, that I dream things and think  they   re real.  Well, I think that   s about it. I   m going to ask you a few questions to kind  of finish up, if you don   t mind.  Thank you for letting us come talk to you today.  25  Provence  Finchum  Provence  Finchum  What?  Thank you for letting us come talk to you.  Well, I   m sorry I ran off at the mouth.  That   s okay.  -------  -------
