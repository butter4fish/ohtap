 Finchum Today is March 18, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Edmond, Oklahoma, to speak with Florence Boyer Tustison. This is part  of our Oklahoma 100 Year Life project, so thank you for meeting with  us today.  Tustison Thank you.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us where and when you were born.  Tustison I was born December 25, 1914 at about a mile north of Carnegie,  Oklahoma.  Finchum A Christmas baby   Tustison Yes, a little one they told me. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Tustison I had one brother, two years older. He was born on Thanksgiving.  Finchum Wow   Tustison Yes. (Laughs)  Finchum He probably wasn   t too thrilled to have you as a Christmas present,  was he?  Tustison Probably not. (Laughter)  Finchum Were you born at home or at a hospital?  5  Tustison At my grandparents, Boyer   s, home. We had gone out there for  Christmas dinner and I interrupted the Christmas dinner. (Laughs)  Instead of Santa Claus coming, the doctor came. So anyway, that   s  where I was born.  Finchum He made house calls.  Tustison Yes, yes.  Finchum And what did your parents do for a living?  Tustison At that time my father farmed and Mother didn   t work outside the  home. She was just a homemaker, took care of the family. On the farm,  my grandparents moved from that place after I was born. We moved  there and Mother raised geese and she   d, I guess it   d be in the spring,  she would pick the down from those geese to make pillows and feather  beds. Those feather beds always felt good in the wintertime.  Finchum Kept you warm, huh?  Tustison Right, right. Both of my grandparents, eventually, moved to Carnegie.  Finchum Do you consider that your hometown?  Tustison Yeah, Carnegie. My mother   s people came from England to America.  My father   s parents    ancestors came from Germany. So I   m English and  Pennsylvania-Dutch. (Laughs)  Finchum And how did they end up in Oklahoma?  Tustison Well, they just migrated from   they both were in Pennsylvania. One of  them came down through into Tennessee and into Oklahoma. That was  my mother   s people. Daddy   s people came right straight down from  Pennsylvania to Oklahoma.  Finchum Did they participate in one of the land runs?  Tustison No, but one of them drew land in from El Reno and the other one  bought the farm from an Indian family that had owned it. I have that.  Finchum Wow.  Tustison I think that President McKinley is the one that signed the papers.  6  Finchum Signed the land patent. Has it been in the family then 100 years? Or  close?  Tustison Close to that because   yeah, more than that because they had it when I  was born, see and I   m 100.  Finchum Okay. And you still have it or it   s still in the family?  Tustison Part of it. I still have twenty acres is all. The rest of it   Highway 58  goes out north to Carnegie and the property was on that. I sold all of  that part off, but I kept twenty acres on the backside.  Finchum Is the house you were born in still standing?  Tustison No.  Finchum No.  Tustison No, but the house that Mother   s father built at Alfalfa, which is about  ten miles north of Carnegie, it   s still standing. The people that have it  now have remodeled it and it   s still a pretty place. One of those square-type  houses, you know, with that funny little roof. That   s where Mother  grew up at after they came from   Eastern Oklahoma is where they  came to. Then they migrated over to Carnegie.  Finchum And they were in Tennessee for a while? Your mother   s side?  Tustison My mother   s people were.  Finchum Do you know what part?  Tustison No. It   s probably in the papers that I have, but I don   t     Finchum Don   t remember. Where did you go to elementary school?  Tustison Carnegie. My first year I went to a little one-room country school. One-room,  well I guess you   d call it country. It was in the north edge of  town. There was, of course, one teacher and I don   t remember how  many students, but we had a pump out in the yard. That   s where we got  our water. Then the two-hole building was on out farther from that.  (Laughs)  Finchum The outhouses, huh?  Tustison We did have a hot lunch program there because we   d take our soup, or  beans, or whatever, in a tin can   tin bucket. Just before noon the  7  teacher would put that up on top of this big woodstove. So that was the  hot lunch program.  Finchum Who knew? (Laughter) How would you get there?  Tustison Well, we lived on the farm at that time and my father would bring us in.  He had a truck at that time and he   d bring me, drop me off there, and go  on to the south edge of town where the elementary school, big  elementary school was  to drop off my brother . Then for second grade  I started in that building, too.  Finchum What was the name of the one-room? Do you remember?  Tustison One-room     Finchum The one-room school. What was the name of it, do you remember?  Tustison I don   t know.  Finchum It   s okay.  Tustison I guess it was just Carnegie. (Laughs)  Finchum They tore so many down, I   m always curious.  Tustison Yes.  Finchum So you went to Carnegie to finish the twelfth grade at Carnegie?  Tustison Yes.  Finchum What year did you graduate?  Tustison Thirty-two, 1932.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  Tustison Home economics. (Laughs) I loved that teacher. Well, growing   when  I was just a kid, I always played house and had dolls, of course. When I  got in the ninth grade, in junior high, Ms. Muller, M-U-L-L-E-R, was  my teacher. I had her four years in home economics, and one of the  strange things that I remember we prepared was baked  bananas.(Laughs) Baked bananas, I   d never heard of it, then, or since.  (Laughter) But anyway     Finchum Were they good?  8  Tustison Well, (laughs) I can   t say they were. We ate them though. (Laughter)  Finchum What were some of the other things she taught? How to sew or     Tustison Oh yes.  Finchum    manage, doing the budget.  Tustison Mostly it was cooking and sewing, and of course how to get along with  people. I   ve forgotten what they called it then, but anyway     Finchum Would there be boys in the class?  Tustison No.  Finchum All girls?  Tustison This was strictly girls.  Finchum Did you play sports when you were in high school?  Tustison When I was a senior I played basketball. I was so short, but I was the  jump center. Back in those days we had the two courts and jump center.  I could jump high, I guess I was so small, didn   t have much weight on  me. (Laughs)  Finchum What were your uniforms like? What would you play in?  Tustison Well, they were down here (gestures) at that time, just above the knee.  Finchum Not bloomers, but something similar?  Tustison Well no, they weren   t bloomers. They were just pants, you know. Kind  of like the boys wear, long right about the knee.  Finchum Once you graduated from high school what did you do?  Tustison I didn   t get to go to school the first semester, because that was kind of  in the beginning of the Depression time. My mother had an aunt and  uncle that lived in Chickasha. The OCW  Oklahoma College for  Women  college was there so a friend of mine and I went to OCW that  semester and stayed with my aunt and uncle. We had cooking privileges  there. Well, the next year I didn   t want to go back there, so we decided  to go to Weatherford  to Southwestern State Teachers College, now  Southwestern Oklahoma State University . So I went there and I had a  9  job of taking care of a man and his wife who worked. I cleaned their  house, made their bed, and they had these Murphy beds. Is that what  you call it? Where it goes up in the wall. Had to put that up, and then I  got their evening meal for them. I also waited tables at a restaurant  downtown. I tried to think of that, but I can   t. Anyway, I first started out  washing silverware. Well that was a job  So it ended up me as a  waitress. I went to school there two years. Let   s see that was in    36     no,    35   and I got a two-year certificate to teach elementary.  Finchum Okay, and did you do that after?  Tustison Yes. I taught in the one-room country school and had children in every  grade except the seventh. One night one of the boys that lived with his  aunt and uncle there, they had a fire and he was killed and two of the  small children of the family were killed, burned. Mothers of some of the  students and I went to the funeral there in Carnegie and it was a sad  occasion of course.  Finchum Very sad.  Tustison But back in this one-room country school, I lived with a family that  lived about a quarter of a mile from the school. They had two children  in school. We   d take our lunch basket and go to school. There   s where  we also had a hot lunch program.  Finchum Well would you walk at that point?  Tustison Yes.  Finchum Still?  Tustison Yeah, we   d walk to school. Snow or whatever.  Finchum About how many children would be in the school?  Tustison I thought I   d bring a picture to show you, but I forgot it. I counted  twelve. Then one was killed and so then eleven. I just taught one year  there. I didn   t like that. Back to Weatherford, I went from Chickasha to  Weatherford and I met a nice young fellow. We went together for those  two years and while I was teaching he was teaching in a two-room  country school up near Hinton. Anyway, we both decided that we  wanted to go to Stillwater. So we worked at Oklahoma City that  summer and got enough money, went to Stillwater that year. That   s  where I decided   well I decided at Weatherford I wanted to be a home  ec teacher. We went there and he was in agriculture.  10  The second year, he had one year and I had a half a year left, so we  didn   t have money. I wrote to my uncle in Washington, D.C. and asked  him if I could borrow a hundred dollars. He loaned us a hundred dollars,  so we got married September 3, 1938. That was my mother and daddy   s  wedding anniversary, so they came up to Stillwater for our wedding.  That last year he went to school and I worked at Woolworth that year.  Then he graduated in    39 and he got a  job  teaching agriculture. We  lived there three years.  Finchum So Stillwater had a Woolworth   s?  Tustison Yes.  Finchum Where was it? Downtown, I   m assuming.  Tustison Yes. Well, on the corner. I think it was on Main. When you first hit that  Main Street there was a clothing department right there.  Finchum There was a Katz. Katz, K-A-T-Z?  Tustison It could be.  Finchum It may have been further down, though.  Tustison Oh, I don   t know, but there was a clothing store there. There was an  elderly lady that worked there and she had a daughter who was   well,  she was about your age. Anyway, and then next door was Woolworth.  But the mother and daughter lived in the apartment building which was  just a block east of that corner, on the north side. It was a big two-story  building. They lived in the north apartment and we lived in the south  apartment. We shared a bathroom that you had to go out in the hall to  the bathroom. (Laughs) That was quite a nuisance, but we were just  there that one year.  Finchum So you didn   t finish at OAMC at that time?  Tustison No, no     Finchum You went back later?  Tustison Yes.  Finchum Okay, so when he graduated he became a teacher at a high school?  Tustison Yes, Freedom.  11  Finchum Freedom.  Tustison It   s out near   well, it   s between Woodward and Alva. Just off of the  highway south of there.  Finchum Do you have any fond memories of campus? Oklahoma A M?  Tustison Well, Theta Pond is one of them. One bad memory   one time I was  going from the library to the dormitory. The path went between two  trees   cedar bushes. As I was going through there a bee got behind my  glasses and stung me. Of course I was all swollen up. I went to the  infirmary after, when that happened. I looked like a mess. (Laughter)  Finchum I think that infirmary building is still standing.  Tustison Is it really?  Finchum Yes. The library, of course, has changed since the    30s.  Tustison It used to be known as the   what are those trees? I can   t remember.  Finchum Trees on campus? There   s magnolia trees.  Tustison That   s it. It was known as the magnolia campus because there were so  many. I don   t know whether they   re still there now     Finchum There   s still a few.  Tustison Are there?  Finchum Yes. I hadn   t heard that, so that   s good to know.  Tustison Yeah.  Finchum Okay. So you married, he finished, off you went.  Tustison Yes, right.  Finchum Okay, from there what happened?  Tustison Well, at Freedom     Finchum Before you go there, let   s back up. During that time period there was  the Depression. Do you have anything you want to say about that  period? I mean, you got married during the Depression     12  Tustison Yes. Well, of course there wasn   t any money. I made, working, I made  ten dollars a week. I took nine dollars and thirty-some cents home.  That   s what we lived on. This hundred dollars that I had borrowed  bought books and tuition and whatever. When our daughter was born  she was   Let   s see, two and a half or three months old we moved to  Washita, which is a little town between Fort Cobb and Anadarko. He  replaced his brother who had taught there. The brother went to  Carnegie, my hometown, and while we were there three years our  second daughter was born.  The Washita school was going to close, so he had to look for another  school. I guess it was the spring of that year,    45, that the  superintendent and the board member president came to interview him.  The reason they came   we had gone to Western Oklahoma, to Altus,  and to Sentinel to see the departments. Sentinel didn   t have agriculture  at that time. They were wanting somebody that could set up a new  program there. So after they interviewed Herbert, he was hired. At that  time Burns Flat opened up for flight school (air force base) and they  built the facilities for that. People from there had gone to California and  other places seeking work. Well, when that opened up they came back  and wanted their places back, so there wasn   t any place for the family.  So the first few months Herbert slept in the superintendent   s office on a  cot for three months. The janitor there then felt sorry for him and found  out his personality and that he was a nice person, so he asked his wife to  rent their front bedroom to him. So he did. So in the summer, that  summer, we went, the two little ones and I, went over and spent one  night there. The children slept on a pallet by the side of the bed. Herbert  and I had the bed. They were such nice people.  Then, later, we found a house. Wasn   t very big, but it was a house and a  home. We were there a while. I don   t know how many years, just a few  years. They wanted their house, so we had to move. We found a place  out in the country, not too far, that we could get, so we were there a  while then we had to move. We just moved all over that town. The girls  were not in school yet. This next home that we had, I had got the third  grade to teach, and I had to have someone take care of the children     they weren   t in school. Jean was, but Donna wasn   t. Anyway, the man  that   the janitor   s wife where we stayed   she took care of the children  for me that year.  Then the next house we lived in was an old house and they didn   t have  baseboards around the bottom and cold   oh, it didn   t have any  insulation or anything in it I don   t think, but it was so cold. Then I told  Herbert that my next teaching job that my salary was going to go to  borrow a loan to build us a house. So that   s what happened. (Laughs) I  think we rented almost, well it seemed like, almost every rent house in  13  Sentinel. (Laughs) At the time I said,    I just wonder if people think that  we have to move because we don   t pay the bills.    (Laughs) But that  wasn   t it.  Finchum So how long did you teach the third grade?  Tustison Oh I just taught one year, and then went back and got   I finished up  my     Finchum Bachelors.  Tustison Bachelors. That was in    52 and had quite a struggle there.  Finchum Now that was back at OSU   Oklahoma A   M?  Tustison Yes.  Finchum Did the whole family move with you?  Tustison No. At that time, they were   Well, Donna was still in grade school, but  Jean, I think   Well, I guess they both were in grade  school . But at  OSU, when I transferred, they accepted my credits. Then when it came  down for me to graduate, one of these teachers decided that she wasn   t  going to accept one of them, so I didn   t graduate. So I called my  husband, and he came up, and we went to the head of agriculture,  forgotten his name. He told us to go to so many of my teachers and get  an okay. Well, one of them wasn   t there so I went back the next week  and that one was there, but this one was gone. I had the awfullest time  trying to get through. I didn   t get to  go through graduation , but they  did send me my certificate. So that was it, didn   t get to wear a cap and  gown.  Finchum You took classes while your children and your husband were still in  Sentinel?  Tustison Yeah.  Finchum Did you commute back and forth?  Tustison Yeah.  Finchum How did you work that out?  Tustison Well, my parents, and my neighbor next door, and my husband took  care of the children. (Laughs) Several things happened. I   d go home and  something had happened and I would say,    Tell the children don   t do so  14  and so,    or    Stay at home and don   t let other kids come in,    that sort of  thing. That was mostly in the summertime.  Finchum You were determined to finish.  Tustison I was determined to finish. Let   s see, that was in    52 I think. I got my  masters in    61.  Finchum For your masters.  Tustison Masters was    61, yes.  Finchum And what did you do in-between getting your bachelor   s and your  master   s?  Tustison I taught home economics.  Finchum Okay, in Sentinel?  Tustison Yes, taught there twenty-two years.  Finchum And did your husband keep teaching?  Tustison Yes. He resigned in    73 and went to Fort Cobb Vo Tech and taught  three years over there. I stayed at Sentinel that year, first year there that  he was gone. Let   s see, that was in    74. I retired in    74.  Finchum I guess sixty-five was mandatory at that time.  Tustison Right, and I took an early retirement. I wasn   t quite sixty-five, but I  took early retirement, early pay.  Finchum That   s been about forty years since you retired. I   m doing the math,  about forty years.  Tustison Yes.  Finchum You enjoyed teaching?  Tustison Oh yes. When I first started, I had eight eighth graders and four classes  of junior through seniors. Then, after I taught probably twenty, eighteen  or twenty years, I had exchange classes with my husband. I took his  boys and he took my girls. That boys    class was something else. I had  one boy that would come in and sit in a chair, lean back, and put his feet  up on the table. Of course that was a no-no. So anyway, two of the boys  in that class came to me one day after class and said,    Mrs. Tustison,  15  would you like for us to take care of him?    I said,    Well I don   t know.  What would you do?    He said,    Well, we   ll take care of him.    I guess  they did because he didn   t put his feet up on the table again. (Laughs)  Another class, I guess it was that same class   anyway, a cooking class.  They were to make a cake. One of the boys forgot to put the baking  powder in it. Well the cake came out like pancakes, and one of the boys  wanted to take that home to show his dad that he could cook. I said,     You   re not about to take that.    So anyway, it was interesting. I enjoyed  it.  Finchum Did the children change much during the time you were teaching,  discipline or in character or anything like that during, that twenty-five  or so years?  Tustison Well, yes. They did.  Finchum You could tell a difference?  Tustison Yes. The last, I don   t know how many years, maybe five years, drugs  became   started coming into school. One of the doctors in Hobart,  which was the next town south, is the one that supplied the drugs. They  finally caught up with him. He spent some time in prison I guess, but  when he got out, he got his job back. He   s still, I guess, still over there.  I don   t know.  It was my job if a girl was out of class a long time from other classes, it  was my job to go to the bathroom and get them out. They were in there  smoking, you know, so that was one of the unhappy occasions. But  everything else   I can   t think of anything else that happened that was  unhappy.  Finchum That   s a long time to teach. A lot of children came through your class.  Tustison Right.  Finchum Taught a lot of girls how to cook.  Tustison Yes. I still get letters from some of them. One girl married one of  Herbert   s students. They live down close to Madill, and they have a big  pecan grove down there. They harvest I don   t know how many   they  sent me a picture of this big semi filled with pecans from their place.  Finchum Did you have a favorite recipe that you would teach them?  Tustison No, we just     16  Finchum Did you make pie crusts?  Tustison Oh yeah, we had three different recipes, three different   yes, recipes.  Bishop I was thinking maybe you tried that baked banana recipe.  Finchum He said he thought you might   ve made them do the baked banana.  Tustison No. (Laughter) I told them about it though. No, I didn   t do that.  Finchum Chicken fried steak?  Tustison Yeah, and the senior girls would have a dinner for two of the teachers at  the end of school each year   the seniors. It was always enjoyable. They  learned how to set the table correctly and all that. We got to eat   I  probably had eight, eight or nine students, I didn   t have big classes,  which was enjoyable.  Finchum Well you were telling us when we got here how you washed dishes.  Tustison Yeah.  Finchum Let   s go through that for the  record  because people won   t know that  today.  Tustison Well, we were studying procedures in the kitchen of different things.  One of them was how to wash dishes properly. If you stored them on  the left side then you washed dishes in the sink on the right, rinsed them  in the left sink, then you stored them up in the cabinet. If you stored  them on the right side it was the opposite. One girl went home and told  her mother how to do that so at church the next day, she was a good  friend, (laughs) she said   what was her name   Anyway, called her  daughter by name, said,    She told me I was washing dishes wrong.     (Laughs) I said,    Well, just it make it easy on yourself.    Oh yeah.  Finchum And which do you wash first? The glasses or the utensils?  Tustison Well, we washed the glasses first. We rinsed them first and dried them,  got them out of that water and dried them. (Laughs) They had to shine.  So anyway, we washed the glasses and the silverware first, and then the  dishes and the pots and pans.  Finchum Pots and pans last?  Tustison Yes.  17  Finchum That makes sense, too.  Tustison This girl   s name was Linda. I couldn   t think of it.  Finchum And would you teach them how to sew?  Tustison Oh yes.  Finchum How many machines would you have?  Tustison We had six machines. I was there probably eight years and we got new  machines then. All of them were Singers to begin with, and most of  them are Singers, but I think that we had one that did a lot of extra  things that Singer didn   t have.  Finchum Would you hem by hand or with the machine?  Tustison By hand.  Finchum That   s hard to learn how to do.  Tustison Right. One girl, when she was making her slacks, she sewed it up  wrong. She sewed the middle together, and of course it just wasn   t right  like that. She brought it up to me and she said,    Mrs. Tustison, what   s  wrong?    I looked at it and said,    Honey, you sewed the centers together  instead of the sides.    (Laughter) But she is a beautiful seamstress now.  Finchum You taught her well then.  Tustison Yeah, and I got a   what am I trying to say   birthday card from her.  She reminded me of some of the things that she remembered from some  of the classes. She had two sisters and they all look alike and they all  graduated from OC  Oklahoma Christian  out here.  Finchum Once you retired from teaching what did you do?  Tustison Oh, retired. Well, at that time my father had died and Mother was living  with us, so we bought   they were building houses right south of  Carnegie and we went out there and selected one and had it moved out  on our property there north of Carnegie, and bricked it, and we did  something to the inside. Anyway, so we had a three-bedroom home out  there.  Finchum She moved in with you, your mother?  18  Tustison Yes, we gave her the bedroom that had the bath adjoining, and we had  the other one.  Finchum So did you actually retire or did you take a second job?  Tustison I was asked to teach at Carnegie occasionally, but I said no. (Laughs) I  didn   t want any more kids because at that time they were unruly. I knew  how students   I guess you   d say, were bad to the teachers. So I didn   t  want that.  Finchum Did you two travel at that point?  Tustison Yes.  Finchum A little bit anyway?  Tustison Yes. We had been   before that Herbert had two weeks off at  summertime and we always took a trip back when our kids were just  little. We   ve been in every state west of the Mississippi and all but   we  haven   t been to Florida or Georgia, but we   d been up through Arkansas  and Tennessee.  Finchum Got all those small New England states?  Tustison No, we didn   t get there. We got as far   we were going to New York  City one summer, but it was so hot. And we had dressed to go New  York, but we got to Oklahoma City, the zoo, and we stopped to eat our  lunch. I said,    Herbert, are you sure you want to go to New York?        Well, what do you want to do?    I said,    I don   t want to go, it   s too  hot.    So we headed west and went to Colorado to his sister   s, who lived  out there. Summer clothes, but they had the three daughters that were  about the same age as ours, so they loaned clothes to the children. So  we got through that. (Laughs) We were there a week with them.  Finchum Got to see the country.  Tustison Yes. We went quite a few places there.  Finchum So when did he pass? When did Herbert pass?  Tustison Nineteen eighty-one, July 14. Three days before his birthday.  Finchum He had a few years of retirement that he could enjoy.  Tustison Yes. He had retired from teaching at Vo Tech, but he did some   well  he had cattle up on his farm, up north at Hinton. He raised a big garden  19  up there, and he   d bring the vegetables home and I   d get them ready to  sell. People from town would come out and buy them. Had some  beautiful tomatoes and cantaloupe. There on the twenty acres that I still  have, we had a fourth of a mile row of asparagus. One summer I sold a  hundred dollars    worth of asparagus. People found out that I had it and  Herbert did most of the picking, because he could crawl and go down.  You had to get down with a knife and cut it. He   d do that, and he   d  bring it in, and I   d get it ready to sell.  Finchum I   m supposing you did the canning on your own?  Tustison No, by that time it was freezing.  Finchum Freezing, okay. Yeah, fast forward.  Tustison I didn   t do any canning or any gardening. Well we had a little garden or  two down there at Sentinel, but not much.  Finchum I guess pressure cookers did come in while you were doing home ec.  Tustison Yes. I had one, but I didn   t use it too much. I   ve forgotten what I  canned, but most of the things were frozen.  Finchum So you got to see that and then microwaves.  Tustison Yes.  Finchum Then crockpots or slow cookers.  Tustison Yeah, had all of those. I still have a microwave, and I have a little, one  of those little crockpots. Just a little one, I still have that. Cooked beans  in it, it cooks real good.  Finchum Over the course of your life, what do you think   s been the biggest  invention?  Tustison The biggest invention?  Finchum Yeah, in your opinion?  Tustison Oh, the spaceship.  Finchum Okay, going to moon.  Tustison Yeah, going to the moon. I remember my mother watching television  and it just baffled her mind. She said here she went across from one side  20  of Oklahoma to the other in a covered wagon and here she just couldn   t  imagine people going to the moon. I couldn   t either, really.  Finchum Education was important to her too?  Tustison Yes, yes. She went to school in Alfalfa where they first settled until she  was, I guess, was in high school. Then they moved into Carnegie and  she went through the eleventh grade. She had been going with my father  a year or so and they decided to get married. So they were married  September 3, 1911.  Finchum Not too  long  after statehood.  Tustison Right, right.  Finchum Did you ever think you   d make it to 100?  Tustison Oh goodness no. I still can   t. (Laughs)  Bishop What are some of your secrets? What do you think   s contributed to your  longevity?  Tustison I didn   t drink and I didn   t smoke. I ate good. We always had good food,  even in the Depression. We lived in town during part of that time.  You   ve never heard of Lamb   s Quarter. It   s really, I think, a weed, but  it   s kind of like   well it grows up on a stem and it has leaves out on it.  The leaves you   d break it off at the bottom of the growth of the leaves  and it tastes like spinach. It   s good. Yes, we had those and we had a  cow, and chickens, and at one time we had a goat. Mother was ill and  the doctor prescribed goat   s milk. She couldn   t have cow   s milk, it  didn   t agree with her. It was my job to milk the goat. My brother, it was  his job to milk the cow. I couldn   t milk that cow, I didn   t have enough  strength in my hands, but the goat was easy. That was my job.  Bishop So the Lamb   s Quarter weed you would eat?  Tustison Yes.  Bishop During the Depression?  Tustison Yes.  Finchum Sounds kind of like a poke salad or something.  Tustison Yes, like a poke salad. Right. You have a picture of it?  21  Finchum Yes.  Tustison Let   s see. Yeah, that   s it.  Finchum Almost like a thistle in a way. Kind of looks like a thistle.  Bishop Yeah, I   ve seen them. I didn   t know you could eat them.  Tustison Oh yeah, Lamb   s Quarter.  Finchum How would you cook them? Or would you?  Tustison Yeah, just steam them like you do other   like poke salad or whatever.  Now poke salad you had to cook it down, pour that water off and then  put fresh water on it. Take that   it   s kind of bitter. Take that bitter taste  out. Have you ever eaten poke salad?  Finchum It   s been a long time. Yes, it   s been a long time though   and ramps. I  don   t know if they have ramps here. It   s a wild onion.  Tustison Oh well, yes. We had some that was on the Carnegie farm. I lived  with   seeing them out in the pasture not far from the house.  Finchum Did you remember rationing during the Depression?  Tustison Oh yes. Well we were given a booklet, some of the leaves were a dollar,  some were fifty cents. Then we had coins, I   ve forgotten what they  were called, along about that time too. We had to have so much. Of  course it wasn   t like it is today. Had to have so much money in the  folder, I guess it was a folder that they had. But by the time I married  we didn   t have a   Well, I guess by the time our daughter was born we  didn   t have those, but we had the coins. I remember we still had the old  coins.  Finchum I guess when your daughters were born, you did cloth diapers?  Tustison Oh, that   s right. (Laughs)  Finchum Way before Pampers and such.  Tustison Yes.  Finchum Laundry got to be a challenge?  Tustison Oh it did. Before we got to Sentinel   well, we had   At Freedom we  had a sink with a pump that you had to siphon. You had to put water in  22  it and then pump to get the water up. That was an experience there.  Then we went to Washita, we had a big bucket that we took to our  neighbors. They had an outside faucet, we went over there and got our  water. They owned the house that we rented, so that   s where we got our  water.  When we first moved there   Jean was about three when this  happened   no, she wasn   t about three. What am I talking about? Not  quite, around two I   d say. I had let her out the back door and it was  fenced in, but it had a gate in the back and she learned how to open that  gate, and one day I went out and she was gone. I was hysterical. I went  over to the neighbors and I said,    Will you boys help me find Jean  Ann?    And the Washita River was about three blocks maybe from  where we lived. I could just see her down there in that water, and  anyway, John went out their back gate and the sunflowers were about  six feet tall. She was standing there just outside our gate with a  sunflower in her little ole hand, picking the leaves off   petals off. So he  brought her in and he said,    Are you going to spank her?    and I said,     No, I   m going to love her.    (Laughs) I was so happy to see her back.  Finchum So you fixed that gate so she couldn   t do that again?  Tustison I sure did. (Laughter) Oh yes.  Finchum Well, you   ve told a story about her. Do you have one for the other  daughter?  Tustison Well yes. When she was little  and  learning to talk, she called her  daddy    Aye-aye    and her   No, her hands were    Aye-aye.    Her daddy  was    Oye-oye   . She couldn   t say n-n. She advanced a little bit when  she got in school. She couldn   t talk plain. First grade teacher told us  that   she had flat feet   said,    If you put corrective shoes on her that  will correct her speech.    Well, we didn   t really believe it, but we  thought we would try it. So we took her to Oklahoma City to a special  shoe store and put shoes on her, ones above her ankle. Do you know  that by the end of school she was talking plain? I told Ms. Thomas, I  said,    You knew what you were talking about,    because it did correct.  She wore corrective shoes then until she was probably in maybe third  grade, but not the high-top boot. They had other kinds, so that was a  story about her.  Finchum That   s interesting.  Bishop I want to go back to childhood being that you were born on the twenty-fifth,  how did that work out with presents?  23  Tustison I had birthday, I had Christmas. I had two presents, and I still do.  Bishop All in one day?  Tustison Yeah, for Christmas giving. They gave me  two  and I still have two  presents. One year, I was thirteen I think, we   no, I wasn   t that old.  Anyway, we lived with our grandparents and they had an upstairs that  we didn   t live in, we just stored stuff. So Mother had told us   well, we  had been told before, not to go up there. But this one day she told us  specifically not to go upstairs. Well, she shouldn   t have said that  because that was what I wanted to do. I wanted to know what was up  there. (Laughs) Sure enough, there was my cedar chest up there. She  had a quilt over it, but the legs showed. My brother had a big truck and  his was up there with a quilt over it. So I knew what I was getting, but  she didn   t know that. It was years, I mean years before I ever told her  (laughs) that I had found that cedar chest before I got it.  Finchum That was for your hope chest? Is that what they called them then?  Tustison Yes and when I moved, my oldest granddaughter, in Kansas, wanted  that and she got it.  Finchum Those are prized possessions.  Tustison Yes, and they just came in and told me what they wanted. It was when I  was moving, or just before I   d moved. So one granddaughter got my  freezer, chest freezer. She got that. She got Mother   s china cabinet  which was, by now it   s over 100 years old. She still has that. Then that  other daughter got a set of dishes, little dishes, little stuff like that. My  grandson got a lot of things of my daddy   s things. My father was a  policeman. He had his badge and his whistle. He had two different  kinds of whistles and knucks. You know what knucks are?  Bishop Yeah     Tustison You know, they fit over your hand. Then he had a thing that fit long,  was leather and on one end it had a big stone in it. That   s what he   d hit  with. (Laughter) It was his job, when he was night watchman, to go out  and corral the Indians. We had a lot of Indians there and they   d be  having trouble and call for help, and Daddy would go out with his  knucks and his police outfit and take care of that. Then the policeman  retired, and Daddy then stepped up from night watchman to be the  police there at Carnegie.  Finchum I bet you minded at home then.  24  Tustison I sure did. (Laughter) When we   d drive in town I   d say,    Now Herbert,  be sure you don   t do anything wrong.    (Laughs) I didn   t want Daddy to  have to put a fine on him or something.  Finchum Sure.  Bishop Well what   s life like? What   s a typical day like for you today at 100?  Tustison Today?  Bishop Yeah, what time do you get up? How do you usually start your day, and  what do you do?  Tustison Well, every day   s about the same. I get up, my alarm goes off at six  thirty, and I get up by seven. (Laughs) I just lay there, hate to get up.  It   s so comfortable right there in bed. I get up at seven, and I go in and  get my bath, and get partly dressed, and make my bed, and then I finish  dressing and get down to breakfast. On Wednesdays they have omelets.  Of course we have a bigger crowd on that day than the other days.  (Laughs) I visit a little bit with the people there, in the home. If the mail  is in, I get the mail and go home   read. Now, it   s income tax and letter  writing before I do anything else. I   m about to get all my stuff together.  I hope to get it finished this weekend and get it sent off.  Bishop And you do your own income taxes?  Tustison No. My part is to sort out everything and get everything, and then I send  it to the CPA  certified public accountant  in Weatherford and they do  it. Some of my bills I have automatic pay, and so then I have to write  myself when I do that. Then my bible   s right there next to my chair, I  read that. I also have one in the bathroom. (Laughter) So I   m well-supplied.  Then by that time it   s lunchtime and I come down and there   s  several others that go in the activity room and sit in those chairs and  wait for the door to open. We visit of course, and we go in and we have  a certain place and I have a certain place. They kind of look up to me on  that, saving that place for me. So then we get our drinks and silverware  and stuff and the lady comes around and takes our order. Then after a  little bit, food   s ordered.  Then after that is naptime (laughs), and then sometimes, though, before  I go up to nap, I go out in the sun when the sun is shining. Go out and  sit in the sun for a little bit. Used to walk around the building, but I  don   t do that quite so much anymore, because the sidewalk in that part,  on the south side, is rough. I   m just afraid I   ll fall. Don   t want to do  that, but a friend that has been here just a few months longer than I  have, and I walk the halls. We go up on six and we go down and back,  25  down and back on five. We do six, five, four, three, and two. Then  we   re on this end on two I say,    Lily, let   s go home,    and so we go  home. (Laughs) Then that   s when naptime comes. So then after that I  just fool around doing little things. And time to eat again. That   s all we  do is eat and sleep. (Laughter) So anyway     Bishop Do you have anything on your bucket list you still want to do at 100?  Something you   ve never done, but you still want to do?  Tustison Something that I   ve never done. Well let   s see, live to be 101.  (Laughter) Yes, I   d like to travel again. I   d like to go to some of these     not the New England states, but some of these other states. I haven   t  been to Georgia or Alabama, but I   ve been to Old Mexico twice. I   d  like to go to Canada, hadn   t been to Canada. My kids go overseas all  the time. I   d like to do that, but I know I can   t. It   s just too much for me  now.  Finchum You said you read some, what do you read?  Tustison Well, I have magazines that I did, but I   ve let most of them expire. But  we have magazines down in the beauty shop. Then they have a library  up on five, and I go up there. I like to read westerns. Yeah I   ve read  Louie Lacore is one of the authors. Have you ever heard of him?  Finchum No, and Louis L   Amour?  Tustison L   Amour  Yeah, that   s it. What did I say? Louis L   Amour, yeah, I like  him.  Finchum He was popular.  Tustison And I read one on Queen Elizabeth and the one on the Prince and  Princess, it   s a small one, with their baby in it. And they   re expecting  another one.  Finchum Any day   or soon.  Bishop Do you have a motto or philosophy you live by?  Tustison Well, let   s see. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  Bishop The Golden Rule.  Tustison Right, right. But some people aren   t like that. We have them here.  (Laughter) We have one fellow that, with his walker, he would run over  26  you if you didn   t get out of his way. It   s kind of bad. Everybody knows  him. (Laughs)  Finchum What   s the biggest challenge at 100?  Tustison The biggest challenge?  Finchum Yes, what   s the biggest challenge you have? You hear pretty well, and  you see pretty good, and you get around. What   s the biggest challenge?  Tustison Oh goodness sakes     Finchum Do you still drive?  Tustison No.  Finchum Okay.  Tustison I left that when I was ninety-four, drove until I was ninety-four.  Finchum That   s pretty good.  Tustison The biggest challenge is going to the grocery store. I still try to go to the  grocery store. And I went   let   s see, the last time I was at the store was  two weeks ago. I go by myself   well, I go on the van, but I go in the  store by myself. Most everyone goes to Wal-Mart, but that   s too big. I  go to Homeland. I like that. The people there know me. You know  and     Finchum It   s more manageable.  Tustison Yes, and they help me if I need help.  Finchum And do you go to church? Or they have it here?  Tustison No. They have church here, but my church is on TV.  Finchum Okay.  Bishop Was church an important part of your life growing up?  Tustison Oh yeah, I   ve been to church all my life I guess. Is that what you asked  me?  Bishop Yes.  27  Tustison And when I went to Sentinel my husband and I both were teachers in  the little   I was in young kids and he was with the teenagers. One year  while we were YA  Young Adult  sponsors, we took a trip to  Southwest. We went in a big truck that one of our student   s father had  and he had put a tarp on it and seats in there. We went to El Paso and  across to Mexico down there. While we were down there, there was a  little town there right south of us, of El Paso. So they told us that they  were having a fair down there. So the lady sponsor, which was an older  lady, and my husband and I got on the little rickety cab and went down.  The only thing they had down there was some Mexicans in a circle with  the shoes made from inner tubes, you know, and they were cut like that  and they were dancing with those shoes on. They had a can of some  kind, it had some kind of drink in it. Then there was a coop with a  chicken or two in it. That was their fair. We were so disappointed, but  anyway we were standing back behind this group that was singing and  one little fellow, he was just a little kid, got tired and he came out and  squatted down behind my husband. Well, the fellow that was managing  had a whip and he came back behind there. We didn   t know it until he  had cracked that whip right behind Herbert. Course it scared us all, and  he put that little fellow back in the ring to dance. The van or the cab or  whatever was supposed to come back in thirty minutes. We were down  there practically all of two hours just standing around shaking, or I was,  wondering what next was going to happen. Finally we got back across  the border and I said,    I don   t want to go down there anymore.     (Laughs)  Finchum But you   ll go north.  Tustison Yes. (Laughter) Right. Can I go back a ways?  Finchum Sure, sure.  Tustison At Sentinel, the girls were both gone, and Mother was with us. We had  exchange students and Mimo, the nicest Mexican young fellow, came  as an exchange student, and we got him for three months. There were  four families there that took him for three months each. I wish we  could   ve had him longer than that. He and Mother were good pals. In  the evening they   d get our evening meal and that was quite an  experience. And there was a wedding, one of his friends was married  there at Hobart, and we got to go to the reception. He would introduce  Mother as his American grandmother. Of course that tickled her, she  was such a loveable little old lady.  Finchum Just like you.  28  Tustison Yes.  Bishop When history   s written, what would you like it to say about you? How  would you like to be remembered, in other words?  Tustison Let   s see, as a nice, loveable, little ole grandmother. (Laughs) One that  still had her mind, and could enjoy other people, and that raised two  lovable daughters with my husband. He was kind of like me, just a  lovable person. I was going to bring my book down that we made, my  grandson put together for me of my 100th birthday. Would you like to  see it?  Finchum We  would .  Tustison Okay.  Finchum Anything else you want to say before we close off?  Tustison That I   ve been here fourteen and a half years, at Tealridge. We have  good care. They   re just helpful all the way around.  Finchum You   ve had a very good life?  Tustison Yes, very good.  Finchum Wouldn   t change     Tustison No.  Finchum    anything or much of anything?  Tustison Most everything   s like it should be. I just wish I could walk better, but  that   s not to be I guess.  Finchum You just have to keep moving somehow.  Tustison Right.  Finchum Well thank you for sharing your stories with us today. It   s been great.  Tustison It   s been a pleasure. I hope I haven   t embarrassed you or anything.  (Laughs)  Finchum No. You were great, absolutely great.  29  Tustison Well, thank you for coming.  -------  -------
