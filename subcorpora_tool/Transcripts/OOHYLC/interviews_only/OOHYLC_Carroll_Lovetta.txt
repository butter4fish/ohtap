 Finchum Today is October 23, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in  Shawnee, Oklahoma, to speak with Lovetta. Did I pronounce that right?  L. Carroll Yes, ma   am.  Finchum Lovetta Carroll, and this is part of our Oklahoma One Hundred Year  Life project, so thank you for having us today.  L. Carroll You   re welcome.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  G. Carroll It   s called Cole Creek.  L. Carroll It was Cole Creek.  G. Carroll Arkansas.  L. Carroll Arkansas. My birthday is October 31.  Finchum Halloween?  L. Carroll Uh-huh.  Finchum And what year?  L. Carroll Nineteen thirteen.  Finchum So you have a birthday next week?  5  L. Carroll Yes ma   am.  Finchum A hundred and two     L. Carroll I   ve been having birthdays, different people remember. In fact I don   t  guess I have all my   I think I took my cards down.  G. Carroll You haven   t got as many yet.  L. Carroll I   ll get more.  Bishop Your birthday is on Halloween?  L. Carroll Uh-huh.  Bishop How did you celebrate?  L. Carroll Yeah.  Bishop How would you celebrate your birthday growing up on Halloween?  Would you get candy?  L. Carroll I don   t make a big deal of it anymore, but as a kid I really liked it. My  father worked in the oilfield and we lived in Osage County. You know  where that is? Way up north. That was the richest county in the state.  We had wonderful schools. We didn   t have to buy our books or  anything. They furnished all of it. The county did.  The first thing they would ask me at school when I got older,    Do you  live in the country or live in the city?    I   d say,    Neither one.    A lot of  times, I had to go to a temporary school, if my father was getting  transferred. So this particular time, it was time for school to start, and  we weren   t sure where we were going to be living. I went to a little  country school for I think about a month, just a short time. They didn   t  want me to go. Maybe it was a month and a half, come to think about it,  so many weeks. The teacher said (this was the first day),    Did you grow  up      now here you are twelve years old.    Now, where did you grow  up? In the city or the country?    I said,    Neither one.    I was asked to  leave the room and go to the office. They must have had somebody,  when you got punished that   s when you went. They would later have a  conference with you.  I got very tearful because I had not done anything wrong. I just said,     Neither one.    Boy, my mom didn   t quit until she got that teacher  moved out. That teacher lost her job in the country because she thought  I was being a smarty with her. That really impressed me. I thought, you  6  know,    If I will just be truthful, I won   t get punished.    (Laughs) That  really impressed me all my life. I thought,    Well there is justice, you  know.     Finchum Where would you have said you lived, if it wasn   t the town or the  country? What would have been your answer?  L. Carroll The oilfield. We lived in the company camp, and my father worked for  this oil company. There wasn   t a grocery store or anything there. They  had their houses. He had a very impressive job. Everything was  furnished. It wasn   t the city you see, and it wasn   t the country.  G. Carroll It wasn   t any agriculture or anything. It was just little houses, all built  just for that.  Finchum Well, where would your mother get groceries?  L. Carroll Well, she went, they went into   I can   t remember the names of the  towns. It   s been too long. We had two automobiles. My father had one  and my mother had one. He was buying a new car every two years.  (Laughs) They   d start out when the cars were older, and ever who had  that car, you know. Sometimes he   d take my mother   s car, and she   d  drive his.  G. Carroll There was one town within five miles of that camp.  L. Carroll I can   t remember. The towns that were close by were Webb City,  Shidler, Grainola. That was the name of the towns. There wouldn   t be a  Webb City now, is there?  G. Carroll Yeah, it   s there.  L. Carroll Is it?  G. Carroll Yeah, there are a few houses.  L. Carroll We had, guess what? My English teacher, Mrs. Chaney, I never will  forget her name, she quit her job. She was a professor at A M, what  was A M then. She was not married. She resigned and put in her  resignation and moved to Shidler. Shidler had some houses that were  for rent. Some housing, I don   t know how it was. I think it was  something where you could go to the little house and then go out your  door and over to the kitchen and eat, like for single people that didn   t  want to cook or anything. There was a lot of businesses up there in  Osage County. She moved to Shidler.  7  We were the closest to Webb City and was where I went to school. The  name was Webb City. When I first went to school, they had one grocery  store. They had two or three businesses. The name was Webb City. I  thought,    Boy, this is the city.    I was just a little kid, I was really  impressed. Found out later, that was not a city. (Laughter) That was just  in its name, was all it was. It was kind of funny.  But we did, the teachers were even paid a little more. This Mrs. Chaney,  she wasn   t married. She made real good friends with me. She quit her  job at the University, what was A M back in that day and age. Instead,  I don   t know what it goes by now. It was A M College back then. She  had quit her teaching job there and came up to Webb City and lived in  this housing where they did all the cooking and everything for her. That  is how impressed she was. She was a lovely teacher. She wasn   t  married, so she just thought,    Why not.    She found out about this place  where I went to school.  G. Carroll The salary was more.  L. Carroll Huh?  G. Carroll The salary was more     L. Carroll Oh yeah   G. Carroll    up there in Osage County.  L. Carroll The salary was more in Osage County than it was at the University.  (Laughter) They were just rolling in the money, and they even had that  in the newspaper, that that was the richest county, Osage County.  Finchum A lot of the oil?  L. Carroll In Oklahoma, a lot of oil.  Finchum Did you go through the twelfth grade there?  L. Carroll No, let   s see. I didn   t. My father got a better and a better and a better  job, and we got transferred. I did graduate there.  G. Carroll You graduated there. Then they closed that school shortly after that.  L. Carroll My sister graduated from a different place, but I don   t remember where.  Anyways, but I got that     8  G. Carroll Everything is at Shidler now. When they have a reunion, why they  include Webb City and Shidler and a couple of other little places.  L. Carroll It   s not that big of deal anymore, graduating from grade school and high  school.  Finchum What year did you graduate? Do you remember? Probably    32,    33?  G. Carroll Thirty-two.  L. Carroll Nineteen thirty-two.  Finchum Do you remember how many were in your class?  L. Carroll No, I really don   t.  Finchum A small number?  L. Carroll No, we had a big class.  Finchum Had a big class.  L. Carroll See, Osage County had so much money that it was just run over with  employees wanting jobs.  G. Carroll There was a lot of oilfield families so quite a few kids.  L. Carroll There was Phillips and Carter. There were about three or four oil  companies that were headquartered there.  Finchum And did you go to school with some Native American Indians? Indian  children?  L. Carroll They talked about Indian children all the time.  G. Carroll I think they were going to different schools. I think they were going to  their own school.  L. Carroll They had their private schools. Evidently, they were paid differently,  for their teachers and stuff. I don   t know.  Finchum Well, how many brothers and sisters did you have?  L. Carroll Let me see, I had two brothers and two sisters. No, more than that.  G. Carroll Three. Three sisters.  9  L. Carroll Three sisters and two brothers and me, made six.  Finchum Where were you in the order? Were you the oldest, the youngest, in the  middle?  L. Carroll I was the oldest.  Finchum You were the oldest   L. Carroll Uh-huh.  Finchum Were you bossy?  L. Carroll I don   t think so. My mother wouldn   t have allowed it. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, can you describe the house that you grew up in there at the  oilfield?  L. Carroll Oh it was modern for the time, one of the best outfitted houses. It was  like city houses. It was all modern. Our house had two bathrooms. If  you had a big family   the bathroom was here and a bedroom here and  bedroom here. We had two things like that. Ours was company housing.  My father had a good job. It was company housing. It was part of his  pay I guess, I don   t know. We had modern houses when very few  people did. That   s a long time back, when I was first in school.  Finchum Well, did your mother work?  L. Carroll Oh no.  Finchum Did she sew?  L. Carroll Yes ma   am.  Finchum Make your clothes?  L. Carroll Uh-huh. Made all our clothes. I didn   t have a store bought dress until I  was in high school. I didn   t have very many then, but I had one or two.  No, my mother did all our sewing. We thought we needed a different  dress every day, of course. We had lots of clothes. (Laughs)  Finchum Did she make your brothers too?  L. Carroll No.  10  Finchum Not the shirts or     L. Carroll No, she wouldn   t make all the cuffs and stuff. She wouldn   t make them.  She had four girls you know. That was enough sewing.  Finchum Sure. Did she quilt?  L. Carroll Uh-huh. She didn   t have very little time, so she didn   t do much.  G. Carroll I have to go get a pill for her.  L. Carroll She had pretty good handwork. She embroidered. That   s something,  too, I didn   t do any of those things. She quilted, and the women would  get together and laugh and tell little dirty jokes and stuff you know.  That was their outing and getting away from their children. (Laughs)  We lived in these company camps, like everybody   s house was white  and they were really nice houses. We had two bathrooms and there was  a bedroom on each side. See we had so many children, so many kids,  we had one of the big houses.  Finchum Nurse George.  L. Carroll I got to see what this is.  G. Carroll Checking me out here. (Laughter)  L. Carroll What is this?  G. Carroll That   s your pill.  L. Carroll My pill, I forgotten even what it   s for now.  G. Carroll It   s supposed to be for your behavior. (Laughs) It don   t work, but     (Laughter)  L. Carroll Why do I take that for? I really don   t know.  G. Carroll Blood pressure. It   s a mild blood pressure.  Finchum You probably don   t take many do you?  G. Carroll No, that   s pretty mild.  L. Carroll And that hadn   t been too long ago.  Finchum When you finished high school, what did you do?  11  L. Carroll What did I do? We lived in Osage when I graduated. Well see, I was the  oldest of six kids, so I did not leave home. By the way, my mother, that  is the reason I had to raise the kids, she came down with a malignancy  in the ear, which is very rare. But see, now this sounds really silly, but  before you had to have driver   s license, I drove the car. My dad bought  my mother a new car every two years for a long time there. He   d take  the two year old car and buy her a new one, see? She would drive us to  school. I can   t remember how old I was when I started driving, but I  didn   t drive to school. We didn   t ride on the school bus either. If the  school bus had gone past the house, my mother wouldn   t have let us  kids ride, but since we lived in company camp, well, the school bus  didn   t come by anyway and stop. Oilfield life back in Osage County  when it was really high, oilfield life was totally different from city or  country either.  Finchum Well, what would you kids do for fun in the oil camp?  L. Carroll They had all kinds of   they had lots of money. They had their own  bicycles and stuff. We, us girls, see I had to take care of kids. That   s the  reason I don   t have any kids today. (Laughs) I had to take care of  children because my mother came down with this infection in her ear.  We couldn   t find it. I drove her   now I   m only, I don   t know, I was  fourteen. Fourteen, fifteen     G. Carroll You started when you were twelve, I think.  L. Carroll I know it. I started driving her every place because she came down with  cancer of the inner ear. That was just almost unheard of. You couldn   t  get it treated, couldn   t get anything done for it in Oklahoma. I took her  in to Kansas and Arkansas City. See, we lived in Osage County and  went to school at Webb City. Here I am, a little old kid, and you know,  I had to practically stand up to pedal that thing. How old was I before I  weighed a hundred? I was way up there before I ever weighed a  hundred. I was really skinny and little. I   d have to stand up.  G. Carroll It wasn   t too long before I met you. You were probably twenty-five or  thirty before you weighed a hundred.  L. Carroll I don   t have any trouble now, at a hundred. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, how did you meet George?  L. Carroll Oh, that   s a good question. (Laughs)  G. Carroll I found her.  12  Finchum Oh you found her.  L. Carroll Okay. Now, I   ve never told anybody else this. This is kind of naughty,  isn   t it? George, I guess he, I think he just mostly felt sorry for me.  G. Carroll She was selling beer is what. I was still in the Marine Corp. It was just  shortly after World War II.  L. Carroll Oklahoma wasn   t dry then.  G. Carroll I was still, I lacked about two months or so finishing my four-year term.  I was just out. My mother had moved to Stillwater, and I just was  looking around, finding my way around and learning about everything,  and found her.  L. Carroll Did your mother and father divorce or did he die?  G. Carroll They divorced.  L. Carroll I thought they divorced but couldn   t remember.  G. Carroll I   d heard about this place. It was attached to the restaurant. I think they  closed what they called the Ancestor  on South Main Street, Stillwater,  Oklahoma . There in the alley behind that there used to be a little house.  They had these laws that you couldn   t have a beer in a restaurant unless  you had a meal first. So you had to have a meal first. They had all the  beer over in that little house. They would also sell beer over there. You  could eat over there if you wanted to.  L. Carroll I was the beer   . I worked there.  G. Carroll She was opening the beer. She worked there.  L. Carroll I wasn   t called a waitress or anything. I was a     G. Carroll Well, you were a hostess. You were really the hostess.  L. Carroll I managed the whole thing for the restaurant. It was Click   s Restaurant.  I mean it was a big time restaurant. That   s where we met. George  wasn   t dry behind the ears yet, but he was a beer drinker. (Laughter) I  never drank a beer in my life, so     Finchum That would have been in the    40s?  G. Carroll Yeah.  13  Finchum Forty-five,    46 somewhere?  G. Carroll That would have been    48.  L. Carroll Then, here when I got off of work, imagine. Here I am. I weigh all of  eighty-some odd pounds.  G. Carroll At that time, you probably slightly over a hundred. You wasn   t big  enough to fight     L. Carroll I had to walk from about two miles and I   d close. By the time I closed  and got the money put away and took care of all of this (this was my  responsibility for the people that owned the restaurant), it   d be real late  at night. I had to walk two miles home after dark. Of course, he was  really, really young, but he was a beer drinker. (Laughter) What was it?  You couldn   t drink beer unless you had food?  G. Carroll Yeah, well you had to order a meal to get to have it in the caf  , but over  there you could get a beer.  L. Carroll So I was over at the beer place, and he would get his food and bring it  over there and eat. He just felt sorry for me and by that time, I had  married. Was I married a short time? I was married a short time.  Terrible person. He saw me and got to watching. He felt sorry for me. I  didn   t realize that. I was so independent and feisty I probably would  have said,    Go to heck,    you know,    I don   t want anything to do with  you.    (Laughs) I was, I was sure of myself. I was not a nice person.  G. Carroll I think you were. I beg to differ on that. (Laughs)  L. Carroll I was naughty. I mean, I didn   t behave nicely. I wasn   t a person like my  mother. I didn   t have, my mother had died. My mother died when she  was fifty-one. She had six kids. You know, that   s where   George got to  where he would walk me home. He found out that I was walking home  by myself. Can you imagine? How far did you say it was?  G. Carroll About two miles.  L. Carroll Can you imagine, at midnight? I think I still weighed around eighty  pounds. I didn   t ever weigh into a hundred until     Finchum What had taken you from Osage County to Stillwater?  G. Carroll She had gotten married. She was married for a short time. They were     14  L. Carroll Oh yeah, I forgot about that.  G. Carroll They wasn   t living together at the time.  L. Carroll Yeah, there was a reason I was there, obviously. I had forgotten.  G. Carroll We became best friends, really. Then, I had to go back and finish my  two months, for four years, in the Marines.  L. Carroll I had to change my lifestyle, you know     G. Carroll I had a little bit of money, and so I helped put her in the nursery.  L. Carroll Oh, in a daycare. Stillwater   Okay, I was a friend of the president of  the college.  G. Carroll No, it was the head of that department Sweetie.  L. Carroll Huh?  G. Carroll It was the head of that department.  L. Carroll Head of the department, Family Relations     G. Carroll Nearly all your customers were OSU families.  L. Carroll They could get a degree, but they didn   t have anything for the children.  So then I started a daycare for children, introduced daycare for children.  It was when Stillwater was A M.  G. Carroll Practically all her customers was OSU families.  L. Carroll A lot of those kids are parents now of course. (Laughs)  Finchum Back in the    50s?  G. Carroll Well, yeah. This would have been in the    50s by the time she put the  nursery in, yeah.  Bishop Where was the nursery located?  G. Carroll Both times it was on Lowry Street. There was an old house that she  started in, and then, soon as     L. Carroll You don   t think I kept you when you were little, do you? (Laughter)  15  Bishop No.  G. Carroll Then, later on, it was farther west on Lowry Street. One was just sort of  a temporary deal. She had this one child that was a baby. We practically  helped raise her. We came real thick with her. She died when she was  like fifty-eight or something like that.  Finchum So, when did you two get married?  G. Carroll Fifty-four.  Finchum Fifty-four, okay.  G. Carroll Yeah, we become best friends. I don   t know what happened. (Laughs)  We fell in love. You know, it   s unpredictable.  Finchum That happens.  L. Carroll Well, here I was. My mother had died, and there was six kids in the  family. There were five besides me. I had taken care of kids. My father  had a good job, drove a new car all the time. We girls, I mean I had to  help sew their clothes. There were four girls and two boys, four girls  counting myself.  Finchum How old were you when she passed away?  L. Carroll I think     G. Carroll Well, let   s see. She would   ve probably been like twenty-five or  something like that.  L. Carroll See, the youngest...  G. Carroll I didn   t meet her. She had passed away about two years before I met her  in November of    48, so     L. Carroll I wonder how old J.C. was whenever     G. Carroll     it probably would have been about    46 when she died.  Finchum Okay.  L. Carroll My mother?  G. Carroll Yeah, when your mother died.  16  L. Carroll Yeah. I said, it was just like heaven you know, to have George come  along. Just kind of, he just kind of took care of things in the  background. If he saw that   I could never make very much salary. I   ve  forgotten what the hourly salary was, but it wasn   t anything very much.  G. Carroll I was surveying for Union Oil Company. I ended up going to Nevada  for three weeks, I think. Then, I decided that I was in love. I knew there  was something wrong with me, but I hadn   t diagnosed it. (Laughs)  That   s when I diagnosed it. (Laughter) So I proposed.  L. Carroll This is so strange. I was just telling him today. I had been mistreated. I  had. Besides having to take care of all these kids, I had a father that was  not a nice person. I was mistreated. He was a good looking guy. Had a  good job, always drove new cars, but he was not a nice man. I had had  to fight my way, and here comes George along and gets me out of all  that mess. I was telling him here one day, he never did give me a good  cussing (laughter) or act like he was angry with me.  G. Carroll I didn   t know you were supposed to. (Laughs)  L. Carroll He has always tried to help me to be a better person. I did, I turned real  quick like. I got in big time with the University and with his family. I  made good friends. I came out of it. If George hadn   t been there to back  me up, I never could have, because here I had these kids...  G. Carroll We done a lot of work with the church. She got real involved in church  and stuff. I think she started three pre-schools at three different  churches.  Finchum In Stillwater?  G. Carroll One in Stillwater, the Highland Park Methodist Church. She started the  pre-school there, then Mothers    Day Out and two down here  in  Shawnee .  L. Carroll They were just leaving them with a babysitter. I said,    That   s a waste of  that child   s life. That child could be learning and doing, be more  prepared for college and stuff.    Boy, it went like wildfire. I had to put a  limit. Daycare became a thing, for a lot of them.  Finchum Well, had you taken classes to learn how to do that?  L. Carroll No  I had five siblings to take care of.  G. Carroll You audited a lot of classes out there. You never had a chance to go.  17  Bishop Did you audit them through OSU? Through the FRCD  Family  Relations and Child Development ?  G. Carroll Yeah.  L. Carroll Did I what?  Bishop You audited courses through the FRCD at the time, at A M?  ,  L. Carroll I don   t remember.  G. Carroll I don   t know where she was going to class through, but it was probably  connected with the child development or     L. Carroll I worked at a business. I kind of came out of it. I got out away from  home. I mean away from my dad and I got out on my own. I would just  audit classes you know. I   d just go in so I could get some ideas about  children of different ages. Then, I had a lady teacher from what was  A M back in those days. Her name was Chaney, C-H-A-N-E-Y. She  was single. She seemed to have plenty of money without teaching. She  came to Webb City with me. She kind of got me started and you know,  on education, how to set up a daycare for children. Boy, they just, these  women that wanted to go to work and was trying to find a place to leave  their kids.  Somebody said, they first started out and said,    Don   t ever try to take  care of over ten.    So I tried that, it was a snap. No problem, because I  had grown up with five other kids, and besides doing all the housework  and cooking and everything, because my mother was ill. I just really  went for it, and first thing I knew, there were other women that went  and started childcare. It was a way they could make money and stay at  home. A lot of them didn   t have any education, how to, they knew how  to take care of kids, but that was about all.  Like I say, then George came along. I was just telling him, I think  today, in all that clutter and everything, I never remember him ever just  getting angry and cursing and stuff. I   ve been around men and seen  women abused a lot. George was always, through the years, he knows  that I think it, he has always been so sweet. I couldn   t understand how I  was so lucky. I finally just decided if no other way, God made it  possible. I didn   t know. What are you going to say? What are you going  to do? Why did it happen that way? Here George, I   m walking home by  myself after midnight when I was working waiting tables. Then, I had  to clean up and everything. I was in charge of all the waitresses and  stuff of this one restaurant. Then by the time I got everything cleaned  18  up and the money put in the safe and everything, I had to walk home  two miles by myself, maybe be midnight. Wouldn   t that be awful?  Finchum How did he pop the question? One of you remember how you asked?  G. Carroll I did. She thought I had too much beer. (Laughs)  Finchum She didn   t take you serious, huh?  G. Carroll No  (Laughs) But you know, we had just been best friends. Then, I  went out to Nevada, and I missed her so much that I just decided that  we needed to get married. She said,    Are you sober?    (Laughs)  L. Carroll That is the first thing you asked me.  G. Carroll I asked you on the phone.  L. Carroll Huh?  G. Carroll I asked you on the phone.  L. Carroll I know. I started to say, I don   t know, we were just visiting. He said  something about it. He said,    I think I need to start taking care of you.     I laugh about that today.  Finchum Over sixty years   L. Carroll Isn   t that nice?  Finchum That   s nice. What   s been the secret for that?  L. Carroll Well, we     G. Carroll Lot of patience. (Laughs)  L. Carroll Now, don   t you have too hard of a time. (Laughs)  G. Carroll I didn   t    (Laughs)  L. Carroll We   ve had a great life. We   ve traveled. By the way, he   s been a big  game hunter for years. He said one year,    Think of something you  always wanted and never had.    He said,    What would you like to have  for your birthday.    I said,    Golly, I can   t think of anything right off.    I  had rings. I don   t wear them an awful lot anymore. I mean, they   re in  the safe.  19  G. Carroll Her fingers shrunk.  L. Carroll They were big diamonds. I do wear them. I just don   t wear them here  all the time. Anyway, I said,    Well I don   t know.    He said,    I think we  should do this, do that.    Anyway, so I said,    Well I   d like to learn to  shoot a gun.    He said,    Well we can arrange that.    I don   t know, how  did we start off, just put up targets?  G. Carroll Oh, you just went with me on an elk hunt, and you got a deer license.  L. Carroll Anyway     G. Carroll I was on horseback. I dumped her off in a spot I thought was good.  L. Carroll We built a room onto this house, we did when we moved here. We lived  in Stillwater for a long time. When we moved, he built a room on, down  lower than this floor. I said,    It seems to me like I should be able to  have something in this room it   s so beautiful.    It was a beautiful room  whenever he first built it on, had it built on. He said,    Well what are  you thinking?    I was thinking about some handwork, or something you  know. I thought I should have something on the wall. He said,    The  only way you can have an animal mount in this room, and he thought  that   s what I meant, is to shoot something bigger than I have.    I  thought,    You awful thing. You   ve been hunting for years. I have to go  out and kill something bigger than you ever had.    (Laughs) Boy that  was quite a challenge. I finally did it. He was down at the edge of the  woods.  G. Carroll I was on horseback. I left you in what I thought was a good spot. I was  probably a mile away on horseback, and I heard a shot. I turned around  and went back.  L. Carroll We spent big money for this hunting trip.  G. Carroll Before that, she said,    I don   t want you babying me.    She not only told  me, she told several people that were camped around close.    Don   t  nobody be babying me around. I   m a hunter just like everybody else. I  don   t want to hear all this crap.     L. Carroll I wish I hadn   t said that. You   re not going to tell them all I did?  G. Carroll Well, anyway, she had to dress the deer.  L. Carroll Yeah.  G. Carroll She put the wrong end up hill.  20  L. Carroll I knew he was going to tell this on me.  G. Carroll When she opened up the chest cavity, the stomach     L. Carroll They knocked me just flat on my     G. Carroll The insides just jumped out and started out on top of her head.  L. Carroll The insides, blood all over me. My hair. We were away from home, and  I didn   t have any other clothes. Can you imagine how a mess I was? I  was up on this hill. He was way down there at the timberline.  G. Carroll We were camped right by a creek, so it was easy to sterilize her.  L. Carroll I know he was just dying laughing. I couldn   t see. I had blood on my  hair, and on me, no clean clothes. But I shot one bigger than his. I did  get it in his trophy room. (Laughs) We had a little fun out of it.  Finchum You were going to dress it yourself without help?  G. Carroll Yeah, she didn   t want me helping. She said,    If I   m going to be a  hunter, I   m going to decide when to shoot     L. Carroll Don   t tell me when to pull the trigger.  G. Carroll    I   m going to dress it myself. Do all this.    I said,    That   s fine, that   s  great.     Finchum But did you know how to dress it?  G. Carroll No.  Finchum Evidently not.  L. Carroll I knew how to cut it open.  G. Carroll She knew how to cut it open. (Laughter)  L. Carroll But I stood down below him. (Laughter) I stood where the animal was  higher than me. So when you split it wide open, you know what  happened.  Finchum I would have been throwing up.  21  G. Carroll We had been on another hunt earlier. It hadn   t worked out too good.  She was planning. I just let her do all the planning she wanted to do. We  was going to hunt hogs, a type of hog. They   re not a true hog, they are  in that family. I was trying to get one to mount. She said,    Well let   s  use my gun. You use my gun. Then, that way you get one that you want  to mount. That way, we will have my gun there and I can kill one to  eat.    We got separated by a few yards. It was real thick brush. These  hogs run after her because she run. I was standing still. She run. There  was a fence there and she went up on that corner post.  L. Carroll I was standing up on a corner post. Can you imagine?  G. Carroll I could see her     L. Carroll I wasn   t as big as I am now.  G. Carroll I could see her, but I couldn   t see the hog.  L. Carroll I was probably fifty pounds lighter.  G. Carroll She was pointing straight down like that. She said,    They   re right here.     L. Carroll I kept saying,    Right here. Right here.    (Laughter) And here I was up  on that post.  G. Carroll Anyway, it was pig squealing. They evidently thought that she had the  pig. It was after her. About that time, I spotted one that I wanted and I  shot it so they all run then. She said, like it was my idea, she said,     There you put me out there and all I had was a camera. I didn   t have  my gun.    I said,    Well, the gun wouldn   t have done any good.    I said,     You had a camera and I bet you didn   t ever get a picture.    (Laughter)  And so     L. Carroll Isn   t he a smart-aleck?  G. Carroll That irritated her a little. I don   t know if you had any dealings with mad  women or not, but (laughs)     L. Carroll We   ve had a good life. I certainly needed it. I   d been through an awful  lot. Had to help raise all those kids. My mother had that cancer. I told  George, when he wanted to get married, I said,    I don   t want a family. I  raised a family. I   m sick and tired of it.     Bishop How did you become interested in working with kids? Even though you  didn   t want a family     22  L. Carroll I actually     G. Carroll She just gravitated toward kids and all the neighborhood kids. There  was all those kids around, and she just was good with them. She could  say anything she wanted to the kid, to try to encourage them to be  better, and they   d never get mad at her. I had to be careful, you know,  because it   d hurt their feelings. You say something and it would hurt  their feelings. It never did with her. She could just say anything she  wanted to, and they   d go along with it.  L. Carroll You see, I decided to explain to children what you were going to do.  You know, like if you were going to go   as an example I   d say,    Now  today, we   re going to take a walk.    I would tell them how I expected  them to do. Like, okay first of all, like I never did want to threaten them  or anything like that. I wanted to try and treat them nice and see if it  would have any effect.  They kept telling me, the department, you know, the teachers,    Now,  Miss Carroll you need      well, Miss Rogers was my maiden name.  They   d say,    You don   t want to ever let a child bluff you.    You know,     Da di da, da di da.    I said,    I   m not going to ever talk bad to a child. I  don   t believe in that.     I   d had good luck with my siblings, teaching them stuff. I would do  things like   okay, rows of seats and at the front of each row, this is just  an example, I would put a candle. I   d light everybody   s candle. Then,  the first one that started tapping on their desk or doing something to  disturb, well that row would get their candle blown out. The one whose  candle burned down first got to have a party, see. (Laughs) I mean the  one that didn   t get their candle blown out.  G. Carroll They got to plan the party.  L. Carroll Yeah. Anyway, it was really kind of funny. Everybody would get to  threatening each other.    Don   t you do that. She   ll blow our candle out.     (Laughs) I used things like that instead of doing something to them,  because I feel like they didn   t need to feel guilty. But they felt guilty  because if they talked or they did something.  Finchum Peer pressure.  G. Carroll I think she was disgusted with raising her siblings, but she still missed it  really. I think she had such good luck with the neighborhood kids and  everything that it just kind of grew into her just deciding to do it as a  business.  23  L. Carroll I just learned. I could take fifteen kids on a nature walk and I wouldn   t  have any trouble at all.  Finchum Just you by yourself?  L. Carroll Uh-huh. We   d sit down in a circle and we would talk. I   d say, well you  know,    How do you do this, how do you do that, what do you do, how  do you act?    and I   d take off. Right across from the church was a big  strip where you could go walking in the grass and weeds and stuff. A lot  of times we   d walk there, we did. I never did have any trouble. I could  take fifteen kids and keep them all under control. What I   d do, instead  of doing something to them, I   d blow out their candle, and the one  whose candle got burned down first, got to have the party, would be the  winner. They wanted to be a winner.  G. Carroll They got to choose the menu and whatever they were going to do for  activity. They got to run the show.  Finchum The last one to have it blown out?  G. Carroll Yeah. The one that had their candle burned down first.  Finchum Oh, burned down all the way to the     G. Carroll If they got it blown out, it wasn   t going to burn down very fast.  L. Carroll I found other ways to control their actions without ever having to scold  them or anything.  Finchum Well, did you learn those type of things from auditing those classes?  L. Carroll  Nods no.   Finchum No, you just knew? Okay.  L. Carroll I thought and thought and thought. I   d never seen anybody else do it.  (Laughs) It was my way of not bad mouthing the child.  Finchum Well, did it always work?  L. Carroll Uh-huh.  Bishop How did you, in terms of the A M, you said they were strong in family  relations, what did you do to convince them that they needed child  development?  24  G. Carroll I think that some of those parents that worked for OSU, I think they  traded     Bishop Stories     G. Carroll    stories back and forth together and stuff. They kind of encouraged  her to audit those classes and stuff.  L. Carroll I had a lot of friends in education, at the University.  G. Carroll She picked up a lot of stuff.  L. Carroll I had several real good. Well, I think how I first knew them. I was  hostess at a big restaurant. At night, when they would have a party or  something, a lot of times they would sit around and talk to me about  children. I can   t wait to experience when you are the oldest of six.  Finchum Sure.  L. Carroll And your mother had cancer and she didn   t take care of them.  Finchum You were the reason that Oklahoma A   M started their early  childhood education program?  L. Carroll Uh-huh.  Finchum That   s impressive.  L. Carroll They were going to do, what were they going to teach and then they  didn   t have anything for the children?  G. Carroll I don   t know. They started something new.  Bishop Practical family relations or     G. Carroll Family relations.  L. Carroll They didn   t have a degree or anything.  G. Carroll Didn   t have anything on child development so     L. Carroll I said, I don   t think that is a very good idea not having something for  children. I never did believe in spanking children or hitting them.  Anyway, I think spanking is hitting. I never did believe in that.  25  Bishop When you intervened, they had a degree in Family Relations, but they  didn   t have a degree in Child Development?  G. Carroll She just suggested that to one of the teachers. She was in on some of the  planning. They just weren   t including that. It was just family. It didn   t  include the children. There was so many who naturally end up with  children.  L. Carroll If you stop and think, actually you can control a child. He will get the  idea that you are being nice to him while he is actually being controlled.  If you put it across correctly, make a story out of it.  Bishop Did they have you on like an advisory board or anything like that?  G. Carroll No, I think they was just traded     Bishop Traded stories.  G. Carroll She had so many parents that were connected with OSU that they     Finchum You just had practical knowledge to share with them.  G. Carroll They just did a lot of talking about kids. Even after they went home,  why they would be telephone calls and of course, that would be the  whole conversation, was kids.  L. Carroll George financed a lot of stuff even before we were married.  Finchum You would have to feed them lunch? Breakfast and lunch probably?  G. Carroll Yeah, in the nursery, why it would include lunch. A lot of times, kids  would end up, she would find out the kids didn   t have any breakfast, so  it   d end up being breakfast too, but     Bishop What would you feed them?  L. Carroll What did you say?  Bishop What would you feed those kids?  L. Carroll I don   t remember. I know I stayed away from real sweet stuff because  that gets to be such a     G. Carroll She probably picked up some   from the auditing, she probably picked  up some ideas about feeding kids and stuff. One thing she learned not to  feed them is one time I made donuts. I took powdered sugar and put it  26  in a sack and shook. She got mixed up and she used my sack that had  powdered sugar in it, instead of flour, and she put powdered sugar on  some chicken. Cooked it for the kids. (Laughter) They wouldn   t eat it.  She couldn   t. Of course she didn   t taste it for a long time. I ended up  tasting it.    The little rats,    she said,    Unappreciative little so-and-so   s.  They won   t eat my cooking.    (Laughs) I could smell it.  L. Carroll I made good money in child care.  Finchum You had to plan nutrition, too, for them if you were doing meals.  L. Carroll Well, a lot of those children never ate correctly at all. I always made,  yeah, I made healthy food.  Finchum Not just peanut butter and jelly.  L. Carroll I can   t remember.  G. Carroll I think she learned a lot about nutrition and stuff from OSU. I mean the  proper nutrition and stuff for kids.  L. Carroll I sure have had a good life. Well, here I am. A hundred years old.  G. Carroll She got me involved in churches. For a long time we taught Sunday  school classes together. I didn   t know nothing about kids. I liked them.  If they were house broke, well, I enjoyed it. (Laughs)  L. Carroll What did he say? House broke?  G. Carroll She had to teach me what to do with children.  Finchum Takes a lot of patience.  Bishop Did you ever think you would make it to hundred?  L. Carroll I never did think about it. I really don   t think I ever thought in those  terms, because if your mother died at fifty-one     G. Carroll Yeah.  Finchum How old was your father?  L. Carroll I don   t remember.  G. Carroll Seventy, he was seventy.  27  Finchum Did any of our brothers or sisters make it a hundred?  L. Carroll No.  G. Carroll No, all her     L. Carroll In fact all my sisters     G. Carroll The oldest other person that was related, her grandmother was ninety-four.  Then she has had two sisters make it. One was just slightly over  ninety, and one was slightly under ninety, in a few months.  Finchum Some good genetics.  G. Carroll When she was ninety, I decided right then that she was going to make it  to a hundred, you know. She was so much healthier. I had done a lot, I  was involved in elderly people in the church. I ended up being the  coordinator of all the homebound visitation and stuff. I was around a lot  of hundred-year olds.  L. Carroll I didn   t really work with the elderly. I never have worked with the  elderly. George works real good with them.  Bishop What is your secret to longevity?  L. Carroll Well, the main thing is, I think, is to make life interesting and exciting.  Feel like that, you know   especially if you think you   ve made  something work when everyone else has tried it and failed. (Laughs)  You go at it a different way and you make it work. You think,    Hey, I  think I will try something again.     I don   t think you make much headway with, especially with   and I  basically worked with children, threatening them you know. I   ve heard  mothers yell out, you know,    If you don   t behave yourself, I   m going to  paddle your behind or your ass.    They   ll holler out what they   re going  to do and talk awful to their kids. I think that is so terrible. You could  take that child and say,    You know when you did this or that you made  me unhappy. I was sad.    They hate to be sad, you know, or    You made  Mama feel sad.     If parents would just learn to make that child feel bad because they   ve  done something. It   s a lot better than slapping them or kicking them in  the rear. You know, people don   t think. I think we just have to think  about it.  28  G. Carroll She made an impression on a lot of kids. We   ve had, oh just gobs of  kids come back after they   re in their twenties or     L. Carroll Yes, we do have. It   s so funny to have somebody as big as you say,     Mrs. Carroll      especially just recently, there   ve been a lot for  Homecoming and stuff.    Mrs. Carroll, do you remember me? I did this  and this.    My gosh, here they are that tall, (gestures) and I had them  when they were this big, (gestures short) you know.  G. Carroll She volunteered for seven years up at the school, up here you know.  L. Carroll I did a lot of it just for my own, proving to myself that children respond  to proper words better than they do to spanking. I don   t think, I doubt  seriously if you ever accomplish much of anything by spanking. I think  you could   ve done much more by saying   or even I have used,    You  know I felt sad when you did this and that.    I   d just make them think  that I felt sad because they had done something. (Laughs) Boy, that  would just really straighten them up.  Finchum Did your dad spank?  L. Carroll Huh?  Finchum Did your father spank?  L. Carroll Huh-uh. My mother would   ve murdered him if he would have. My  mother was     G. Carroll Funny thing, we had this little girl that we ended up keeping her most of  the time for about eleven years. She had been adopted, then the parents  had divorced and they had remarried and     L. Carroll Can you imagine adopting a child and then getting a divorce?  G. Carroll Just one disappointment for her after another. There was just the  meanest old gal lived right down below us. She would scream, when it  was lunch time she would call them all bad names and tell them to get  their you-know-what   s in there it was time to eat and this and that. The  dogs was afraid of her. The kids was afraid of her. She   d yell at the  dogs and one of the dogs was named Sweetie. (Laughs)    Sweetie get  your    in here.    This Anna, this little girl that we had, she said,    You  need to learn to talk nice to those dogs.    (Laughs)  L. Carroll She told that old lady that.  29  G. Carroll Lovetta went in that house. She fingered she was going to get cussed  out by her. It was every day that you would hear her scream bad words.  Anna said,    If you   d just talk nice. Those are really nice dogs, if you   d  just talk nice to them.    It was just the way Lovetta had taught her.  (Laughs)  L. Carroll Anna was an adopted girl. We took a lot of care of her. I had her with  me a lot.  Finchum You have impacted a lot of lives I say.  L. Carroll Oh, I think so.  G. Carroll The biggest disappointment   I had really worked to get something else  for her to do to get her mind off it   her ears went bad. She found out, I  certainly didn   t know it myself, but you just can   t hardly work with kids  if you have a hearing problem. They get mad if you say you didn   t hear  and ask them to repeat it.    I told you once, you know.     L. Carroll They   d turn around and tell you,    I told you.    And they don   t know that  I had a hearing problem.  G. Carroll Then ended up with macular degeneration. It just ruined her as far as  being able to take care of kids. That was her main thing in life. We had  to find things to do.  Bishop What is a typical day like for you today? What time do you get up, and  what are some of the things that you do during the day?  L. Carroll We probably sleep a lot later than we used to do. I don   t know since I  don   t see the clock and stuff. I don   t know what time     G. Carroll Right now she   s getting up about eight o   clock, is probably the normal  time.  Bishop Then what do you do after you get up typically? What types of things do  you do during the day?  L. Carroll I don   t know. Of course this is me. I go around feeling. I clean. I   ll  clean the table and everything over there. George will say, which he  does most all the cooking. He   ll say,    You better leave that alone and  get yourself around, because you   re going to be ready. You need to set  down and eat right away,    and stuff like that. I don   t see enough. I   m  practically blind in this eye.  30  G. Carroll She does a lot of cooking, but it   s team work. She still bakes a lot of  cookies and stuff. She just does   whatever she can do, I let her do. I do  the rest of it. I let her pick the things that she can do.  L. Carroll When we do the cooking thing, he   ll tell me     G. Carroll I learned to cook for self-defense. My mother was a sorry cook and all  three of my sisters was a sorry cook. One of them finally got to be a  pretty decent cook, later in life. So I had to learn to cook to survive.  L. Carroll The way we do cookies, well he   ll just tell me,    A cup of this, cup of  that.    He   ll set stuff out for me.  G. Carroll I read the recipe. She can   t use the microwave or the oven with her  eyesight. Different things, I pretty well know what she can   t do, so I     L. Carroll I make all the cookies.  Finchum What kind of cookies?  L. Carroll Sugar cookies. That   s the kind that I find that everybody will eat, just a  plain sugar cookie.  G. Carroll Right now, we   re doing sugar cookies. Then sugar jumbles. It started  out with M Ms in it. We also put some with almonds and some with  pecans and different things. We don   t     L. Carroll Would you like to have a cookie?  G. Carroll This little girl that died     Finchum That   s okay. Maybe in a little while. We aren   t done yet. Scoot back up  here. (Laughs)  G. Carroll This little girl that died that we took care of, every birthday, she lived in  Stillwater, she come down and she wanted a     L. Carroll What I   m really trying to do is get me a sip of water.  G. Carroll Your cup   s back in the back there. Just a minute, I   ll get you a cup.  Here.  L. Carroll That   s where it   s supposed to be. I can   t see.  G. Carroll Here you go.  31  L. Carroll Oh thank you sir.  G. Carroll There you are ma   am. We always bake   every birthday we bake a  German chocolate cake. She got to where she couldn   t     L. Carroll I am going to get  some cookies .  G. Carroll Okay.  Finchum So, you were raised in Stillwater?  G. Carroll No.  Finchum What brought you to Stillwater, when you met her?  G. Carroll Well, my mother moved. During World War II, she moved to  Stillwater. I would come to see her.  Finchum Moved from where?  G. Carroll She moved from Guthrie. Yeah.  Finchum You went to school in Guthrie?  G. Carroll Yeah, I went to high school in Guthrie. I went to a country school. I had  to ride my horse to school, in grade school.  Finchum I just can   t imagine having to have to do that.  G. Carroll There was probably five kids that rode a horse in that bunch.  Bishop She brought you a cookie. There is a cord right there.  Finchum You   re doing fine. There you go.  L. Carroll I can   t touch them because my hands are dirty. I feel everything. I can  feel dust on my hands. That   s okay honey. I need to wash my hands  now. I touched everything. It   s dusty. I can feel it on my fingers.  G. Carroll Anyway, back to that German Chocolate Cake. She figured out that I  could read the recipe to her and she could bake the layers. Then, she  turned it over to me. She had the three layers. Then I   d have to   then  she   d also mix the filling. Then, I   d take over and do the rest of it. She  forgot to take the parchment paper off of one of layers once. I didn   t  find it until I already had the cake put together. So I slide a knife under  there and loosened it and thought I could just pull it out. Well, that one  32  layer, it came apart in about ten pieces. (Laughs) But I   d done a lot of  work with brick and cement and mortar. So I took the layer and used it  for mortar and put that back together. It was for that little girl and  Lovetta was very nervous. She thought I   d throw it away.  Finchum Have a cookie Alex. Want a cookie?  Bishop Yeah.  Finchum So, the German Chocolate cake is a specialty?  L. Carroll Huh?  G. Carroll That was then. We haven   t baked one since the little girl died. It   s been  about two years since she died.  L. Carroll Here, have a cookie.  Finchum I will have a cookie.  L. Carroll They   re frozen. That   s just a plain old sugar cookie. I don   t like nuts.  Finchum Not even pecans?  L. Carroll Huh-uh. But George does, so his are gone.  G. Carroll They give her a little trouble with her teeth.  L. Carroll I don   t like nuts, honey. I never have liked nuts. I don   t like nuts.  Finchum Well, the other story we need you to tell us is about a woodstove. Right?  Bishop Yeah, you told me a story about a woodstove when I was here the first  time, about that woodstove you always wanted.  G. Carroll We didn   t have any place for one. I found out she wanted a woodstove  real bad. I decided to build on, build the three rooms. The end of the  house used to be there where that archway is. I decided to build on to  the back. Then I thought,    Well if I am going to do that, I may as well  make one big room for the animal heads.    Anyway, we built that wall  and everything with all that brick just to put that woodstove in.  L. Carroll He said to think of something I always wanted but never did have. I  used to think my grandmother, and I think I had an aunt or two that  lived in the country. We lived in the oilfield. We   d go to their house on  weekends. We   d have to go from Osage County down to around  33  Stillwater. I thought,    I just wish we didn   t have to have that heating  system.    It wasn   t a stove like up at Stillwater. I said,    Boy, I wish we  lived where we could have a woodstove.    Anyway, one year, George  said,    What do you want for your birthday? I can   t think of a thing to  get you.    He said,    Think of something you   ve always wanted, but  never had.    I thought of something. He said,    No, you   ve had that.     I finally said,    I know. I always loved to go up to Penn Creek where  they had a woodstove.    I thought that was   growing up in the oilfield,  you know, I thought that was the greatest thing in the world. I couldn   t  imagine. My grandmother made all her bread and cookies. We   d go  spend the night Saturday and Sunday, then come home Sunday evening.  Grandmother would always bake something. She   d always have me to  help her. She   d let me help her. I was probably seven or eight years old.  I could help her do things you know, little things. I thought that was  really great. Anyway, George said think of something I   d never had. I   d  say something and he   d say,    Well think of something else. You   ve had  that.    I finally said,    Well how about a woodstove?    I thought,    You  know, when would you ever use a woodstove in a house like this?    It  has a heating system. First thing I knew I had a woodstove out here.  (Laughs) Did you build a room for it too?  G. Carroll I built three rooms back there. Back     L. Carroll Anyway, I got the thinking.    My gosh George, don   t ever do that to me  again. Look how much money you   re spending to build on a room and  get a stove.    He said,    Well I thought you said you never had had a  woodstove.    I did. I thought that woodstove would be the most  wonderful thing in the world, because even when I was a kid see, we  didn   t have a woodstove in the oilfield. I never had lived where we had  a woodstove. Anyway, we have a woodstove. (Laughter)  Finchum Do you use it?  G. Carroll We used to use it a bunch.  L. Carroll George does at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  G. Carroll We   ve had it twenty years, I guess. The last time we changed the heat  pump, it doesn   t work quite as good. When I first put it in there, why I  could just get it, keep enough fire in the stove to keep the thing from  kicking on, the emergency heat. It doesn   t seem to work. It makes this  one part of the house hotter than the rest of it.  Finchum It has that special smell too, doesn   t it?  34  G. Carroll Yeah.  Finchum I think that is what we like? Memories   L. Carroll I just thought that was the greatest thing to have the woodstove. About  Christmas and Thanksgiving, we have a wood fire in it.  Finchum What would you do for Christmas when you were growing up?  L. Carroll Well, we lived up in the oilfield.  Finchum Would you have a tree?  L. Carroll Oh yeah.  Finchum Would you get presents?  L. Carroll Well, yes. The little ones always got the Santa Claus. There were six  kids    (Putting cookies in a container)  G. Carroll They   re not all going to go in there dear.  L. Carroll I   m not going to put them all in there. I was going to save them for me.  I know the table is clean. Nobody else does.  Finchum They   re very good.  L. Carroll I take this and put in almonds and stuff sometimes, but I don   t like nuts.  The last ones I made, I had nuts in them. These happen to be, if I   m not  careful, I   ll not get them out of the freezer and we   ll keep them too  long. I like them, just a sugar cookie.  G. Carroll The preacher, we used to have, loved those. Those were his favorite  cookies. He drank beer with them. (Laughter)  Bishop I want to know, when history is written, what would you like it to say  about you?  L. Carroll What?  Bishop When history is written, what would you like it to say about you? How  do you want to be remembered?  L. Carroll I don   t know. One thing, I really love life. I mean instead of cursing the  day because you feel   occasionally somebody will say,    I just feel  like   something bad or this or that.    I don   t like negative thoughts.  35  Negative actions. I like   I just hate negative things about life. You  know, like    Oh, I had a bad day today.    Well, you probably did  something to make it bad. I   m not really   I don   t know. I   m a people  person. I just don   t see very much negative. I mean, even if somebody  does something different than you do, that doesn   t mean it   s wrong. I  just like for people to not be criticizing or bad mouthing. I like to be  happy and make the most of every day.  I think,    Don   t let the day just slip by.    Do something good for yourself  or somebody else. I think even being good to yourself. God gives you  that body. You didn   t just come along and find it out on the highway or  something. I just feel like that we need to be thankful for life. I   m not a  very deep thinker. I mean I   m very realistic. I think that if there is  anything that you can do for somebody and help them, that   s okay. You  don   t have to help somebody. You can just be kind to yourself. Do  something, be good to yourself. After all, where do you think you get  this life? You know, you can be thankful for it. It   s not wrong to be  thankful for your own life. If you believe in God, then you didn   t just  drop out of the sky.  Finchum You went to church quote a bit as a youngster?  L. Carroll We always went to church on Sunday. Always   Finchum Even in the oilfield?  L. Carroll Yeah, but they didn   t have them through the week. Sometimes they did  have a Wednesday night, but not very often. There was a lot of oilfield  people that worked the night shift and that wasn   t hardly fair.  Bishop Did they ever have revivals in the oilfield?  L. Carroll What?  Bishop Like a revival in the oilfields?  L. Carroll Yeah, they would bring some   like years ago, I don   t know how far  back this was, Amy McPherson, you know. They had her up in Osage  one time. I don   t know how much they had to pay her. (Laughs) They  had her, I think, at Shidler. I don   t think they had her at Webb  City , I  think Shidler had her. There wasn   t many churches up in the oilfield for  a long time.  Finchum Would they have dances?  L. Carroll Huh?  36  Finchum Would they have dances?  L. Carroll I suppose. I was so little, I don   t know.  Finchum Don   t know.  G. Carroll That church probably didn   t believe in dancing.  L. Carroll Huh?  G. Carroll That church probably didn   t believe in dancing.  L. Carroll Well, I don   t know. My mother, she went to dances all the time she  grew up. She grew up in the country. My father couldn   t dance. He  didn   t know anything about it. My mother was a real good dancer.  Finchum Well, did they have music in the home?  L. Carroll We had music every Saturday night at my grandmother   s house. I had  an uncle, two uncles that played the violin, the fiddle as they called it.  Here I am, a kid about like this, (gestures short) and I   m at this organ  and I   m standing up and pedaling it and chording. I used to do the  chords while they did, they played the fiddle, as they called it, and the  banjo. Somebody played a harp. Every Saturday night, my mother   s  family would   of course my mother and us, we lived in the oilfield, but  everybody else was still country people. Every Saturday night, they  would all get together.  My grandmother, she was a little short lady and a great cook. She would  get in there on that old woodstove and start cooking, bake something or  make a bread pudding or make something on the dessert type. Then, my  uncles and some of the other people   I mean, my grandmother and  grandfather   s house was a real big house. Boy, nobody would go to bed  on Saturday night. Finally about daylight, everybody would be going to  sleep. They   d be sitting in their rockers, chairs or something. The kids  would all be on quilts on the floor. They   d play and some of the couples  would dance. My job was   we didn   t have a piano. It was this organ.  We had to, you know, do the pedals, and they   d give me chords that I  would just play all the time. My uncle was playing the fiddle, as they  call it. There   d be the ones that danced.  My grandmother   s house, it was real big, and it was that way every  Saturday night. I don   t know what they drank. I was just a little kid.  They had something that they were drinking all the time. (Laughs) They  would make, usually some kind of fruit drink or something for the kids.  37  Usually by midnight, I was the only kid up. I got to stay up with them  because I got to chord on that old  organ . I don   t know what I was  doing. I don   t know a bit, they   d tell me what I had to do while they  played the fiddle, the men were playing the fiddle. (Laughs) And a  banjo. And somebody played a harp. Those things that you do like that.  Finchum A Jew   s harp?  L. Carroll Yeah, a Jew   s harp.  Finchum What was your mother   s maiden name?  L. Carroll McIntyre.  G. Carroll Maiden honey. Oh yeah, you   re talking about the last name.  Finchum Yeah, uh-huh. The grandmother. McIntyre?  L. Carroll I am trying to think. McIntosh was the     Finchum McIntosh was the     L. Carroll My grandmother and grandfather was McIntosh.  Finchum Okay. So it was their house?  L. Carroll Uh-huh. Well, because they didn   t have a car. They were older. They  had a horses. Well they had a pickup. We always met at their house. Of  course, we lived in the oilfield. We would have to go down there, and it  was quite a ways down there, on the weekends.  Finchum And you had the new car to go in?  L. Carroll Oh yeah. We always had new cars. (Laughs) My mother just lived to be  fifty-one.  Finchum So do you have anything on your bucket list?  L. Carroll Do I what, hon?  Finchum Anything on your bucket list? Something you want to do or some place  you want to go? Nope.  L. Carroll Don   t guess.  Finchum You   re content?  38  L. Carroll Yeah. I   ve traveled all I ever want to travel.  Bishop Where is the most favorite place you   ve ever been?  L. Carroll I don   t know. Where do you think I liked best?  G. Carroll Probably Colorado. You used to have a lot of fun in Colorado.  L. Carroll Yeah.  G. Carroll The snow, she liked the snow.  L. Carroll I love snow. In fact, I was known to go barefoot in the snow. (Laughter)  G. Carroll I   d come in   it was my job, a lot of times I was up all night.  L. Carroll He didn   t know I liked it when we was first married.  G. Carroll I   d come in about daylight and I   d look around of course, and being a  big game hunter, I always noticed tracks. I looked and they were tracks  that looked like a bear track at first. Then, I got to looking at the shape  of it and I could tell it was a human, it was a human track. It was  barefoot. What would a barefoot track be doing, somebody roaming  around the house barefooted? She had went out to get the paper  barefooted.  L. Carroll I loved to feel my feet in the snow.  G. Carroll I found out she was doing that about every morning. I just hadn   t ever  noticed it before.  Bishop You might have thought it was Sasquatch.  G. Carroll Yeah, it wasn   t Bigfoot. (Laughter) She finally talked me into it     L. Carroll If it snows, I   ll be out there.  G. Carroll    on our thirtieth anniversary. I think we was in Colorado. She said,     Yeah, you coward. Take your shoes off and come on out here.    I tell  you, my feet just turned blue immediately. I mean, I don   t know how  she did it. (Laughs)  L. Carroll I do that here. First time I did it, first time anybody found the tracks,  they couldn   t believe it was me. Ever who was breaking the news to me,     Somebody had been barefoot out on the sidewalk.    I said,    Oh I know.  39  I wouldn   t do that because it   s cold.       Well, I know. That   s the reason I  saw I guess. I said in the snow.    (Laughs) I said,    I don   t believe  anybody would do that.    I   d finally admit that I did it. (Laughter)I like  the feel of my feet in the snow.  Finchum Not for very long I hope.  G. Carroll She   s quite a while. Up there in Colorado, she would stay fifteen,  twenty minutes out.  Finchum Wow.  G. Carroll She has handled disappointment real good. I mean, just like the deal  with her eyesight and ears and everything. It doesn   t take her very long  to pick up something new to interest her and stuff. She just bounced  right back. She took a disappointment.  Finchum Kind of know the lay of the land of the house? You can feel your way  through the house with your poor vision? Know where everything is?  G. Carroll Yeah, I got rid of all the carpet and tried to get everything the same  level. Except she doesn   t go downstairs without me being with her.  Everything else is pretty well the same level.  L. Carroll We have a downstairs.  G. Carroll Except that one drop-off out there. It   s short. I fixed it so you can see  everything real good.  Finchum Just learn to roll with the punches.  L. Carroll I guess.  G. Carroll She   s been very courageous.  Finchum And independent, in a way.  G. Carroll She   s followed me up to twelve, thirteen thousand foot. I don   t know  how, I wasn   t very wise some of the places that I led her. I enjoyed her  being there.  L. Carroll See my uncles, there wasn   t any boys, and they treated me, all of them  did, they   d take me hunting with them. I could go. They   d take me  anyplace. I never did have kids to play with. I had uncles. You know,  the older people. I was (laughs)   my uncles, nobody had boys. They  made me really tough.  40  Finchum Maybe that   s your secret to being a hundred?  L. Carroll Well, you know, I have two brothers that died. How many sisters?  G. Carroll Three.  L. Carroll Yeah, I know my brother died because he had such a temper. Oh, he  had an ungodly temper. You know, out of a clear blue he could just  throw a fit that would just upset the whole evening. My mother, she   d  never touch, she never spanked a kid. She never would say anything to  him. She felt sorry for him. She thought he couldn   t help it. She really  thought that he had something wrong with him that made him act like  that. That was just her way of not, because she didn   t spank kids. I was  the oldest of the six. She just never did spank a kid. (Laughs) She kind  of humored the boys. I thought both of my brothers were kind of not  like they should be. (Laughs) My mother, that   s just the way she was.  She really liked boys. I swore that she liked boys better than she did  girls. I don   t think so. I think it was just that my brothers had, my  brother had a terrible temper. He was just really bad. I mean, just  anything would upset him, and he   d act bad. You think he did?  G. Carroll Oh yeah  Yeah, that one. Both of them really, but one was a lot worse  than the others.  Finchum And you were just the opposite?  L. Carroll Oh yeah. I never thought about  acting like he did . I don   t know.  Finchum Well, I think we   ll round this up and say thank you for sharing your  stories with us today   and your sugar cookies   L. Carroll Okay. Nice to have you.  Finchum Nice to be had.  -------  -------
