 Finchum  Coldiron  Today is September 30, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Edmond, Oklahoma to speak with Exie Coldiron. This is in regard to our  100 Year Life  Oral History Project . So thank you very much for having  us, today. Let   s start by having you tell us when and where you were  born.  Okay. I was born at Bristow, Oklahoma   my dad was a farmer   on the  farm. You want to know when I was born?  Yes.  Nineteen thirteen. July the 21st, on a Monday morning, Momma said. I  remembered it. (Laughter)  Were you the oldest?  Oh, no. The youngest.  You   re the baby.  Well, no. I   ve got a sister that passed away, four years younger than I.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  Two brothers   both of them were the two oldest. My oldest brother, he  was twenty-one years older than I. Both of them fought in World War I.  I can definitely remember that. We lived in Atoka, Oklahoma. Momma  would always, you know back then, all the mail came by the mail  carrier. Momma would get letters from the boys and she was so scared  that something would happen to one of them if it was a late time getting  5  Finchum  Coldiron  there. We had two big trees in the front of the house. I remember this. I  was five years old, but I remember it. Momma would always go out  there and kneel and pray before she   d open them letters. I wish she   d  have kept them.  Did they both make it back?  They both made it back. Oh, but I have a little story that goes with that  that is very interesting. My oldest brother had went up into Canada a  working. My youngest brother was only eighteen. Over here at Fort Sill  is where he was stationed. All of them took the flu. They were all sick.  Of course, that just scared Momma to death so she had my dad   back  then, we went on a train everywhere you went. Nobody had a car. Our  doctor had a car, but my dad didn   t. He never did learn how to drive a  car. (Laughs) So everywhere Dad went, I went. I just followed him.  Nobody else. I was like a tomboy. Anyway, Momma said,    You   ve got  to go see about Ulysses.    He was only eighteen years old and he was  supposed to have the flu. Of course, I throwed a fit. Momma said,    Take  that girl with you.    My baby sister, that is passed away now, was one  week old. She was a great big baby so Momma had her hands full taking  care of her. I just wanted to go. (Laughs)  So anyway, Dad took me. This is so funny. I   ve got to tell it. We went  and got on the train at Atoka and headed for Fort Sill. We come through  Shawnee and I well remember when we had the layover in Shawnee.  You never seen so  many , in my memory, soldier boys. They all had  these little oversea caps on. They were going overseas. The streets   you  couldn   t walk down the streets of Shawnee. There were so many  soldiers. Young, all of them, young. Dad left me with a policeman while  he went to find us a room for the night. Then we had to catch another  train to go on out to Fort Sill. There was a big table and at one end of the  table, there was a deal that you put a quarter in, and if you were lucky,  you could win a box of chocolates. Of course, them boys   most of them  had girlfriends, probably. They were all there trying it. One of them said  to me,    You give me a kiss and I   ll win a box of chocolates for you.    I  think I kissed every soldier going overseas. (Laughter) And I got a box  of chocolates. I was going to save them and bring Momma back some,  but I well remember that when I got ready to come home, there wasn   t  no chocolates left in there. (Laughs) So the next morning, we caught the  train and came up to Fort Sill.  My brother wasn   t that sick. He just was lonesome and going overseas  and everything. Of course, he wanted to see Dad and Momma. They all  had long white gowns on. I noticed that, first thing. I said,    Y   all haven   t  got any clothes on, you   ve got a gown on     (Laughs) I went inside and  hopped up on the bed with practically everyone in that hallway, all them  6  Finchum  Coldiron  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  boys, and talked to them and probably kissed every one of them. But I  didn   t take the flu. I don   t think they had it. (Laughs)  But anyway. One of them was a little guy, and they called him Mousy. I  remember that. So, I always baked biscuits. I was a biscuit baker. I told  all of them I can bake biscuits. They said,    Well, you can go with us      They were having fun.    You can go with us overseas and we   ll let you  bake biscuits for us.    I didn   t want to go home with dad. It   s the truth.  (Laughs) So I was going to go overseas. I came home telling Momma,     I   m sorry I can   t stay, Momma. You   ve got the baby and I   m going  overseas to bake biscuits for Ulysses and all of them.    That little guy got  killed. My brother came back, you know, but he got killed. Yeah. But I  remember all that, very much so.  Do you remember when your brother came back?  I don   t know the date, but I remember seeing him, yes. He was going  with a girl and they were fixing to get married. We lived at Atoka and  we had two rivers there, Clear Boggy and Muddy Boggy. We lived  closer to Muddy Boggy than we did Clear Boggy. But you didn   t do  anything but fish out of it, you know, and watch out for snakes because  there was a lot of them. Shall I tell them about the wild boar getting  them up the tree?  It   s up to you.  Daughter-in-law Jocelyn Coldiron joins the interview   Well, that   s another story. They say wild hogs are coming back. Wild  hogs are mean. They   re meaner than any other animal. Me and my  mother   and this is of course a different time   and my baby sister, she  was walking. We went down in the woods to hunt for wild onions.  That   s what people on the farm used to do, and pick poke salad, you  know. It come a storm a few days before, and it blowed this great big old  tree over. It was in our way so Momma was going to go around it. We  was walking, Momma and us to girls. I was walking. She was probably  carrying my baby sister. Here was this old mother brood sow, and she  had ten baby pigs. She didn   t do a thing, only just get up and make a  dive for Momma. Momma grabbed me and my baby sister   her name  was Alphalea. We got on that big log and walked up it to where we  could be out of the reach of the hog. That old hog didn   t leave there until  my dad came with a shotgun. Momma kept calling, but Dad was  plowing and he was at the other end, you know. We stayed up there a  long, long time. Every time we   d move, up she   d jump. Dad didn   t kill  her, but he sure did burn her good. She left. Yeah. You couldn   t get  away. We was all afraid. We wouldn   t leave the yard. You had to play  right around the yard. Too dangerous. Yeah.  7  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  How had you gotten from Bristow to Atoka?  Oh, in a wagon, of course. I really don   t remember our moving. There  was probably something else took my attention. But Dad lived there  quite a while. He had a brother that had come out of Arkansas and come  into Oklahoma. My dad came here during the Run, but he didn   t get to  sign up. You had to be twenty-one years old, you know. My dad came  with two cousins that come on horseback from Arkansas. Dad didn   t  know that. There was no communication back then. Dad wouldn   t have  been twenty-one until the tenth day of August   that   s his birthday.  So he didn   t get to claim land.  He didn   t get to, no. He didn   t get to make the Run. They were running  for land. He didn   t get in on it.  Did he always farm?  He always farmed, oh yes.  Did you have some chores, growing up, then? On the farm?  Oh, I did. I milked cows when I got about ten years old. Oh, yeah.  Where did you go to school?  Wherever we lived. (Laughter)  Was it a little one-room schoolhouse?  Well, yes. We finally    Well, this was a double deal. My mother  married Dad, and he had a younger brother. My Aunt Emma was  Momma   s sister, so she married him, and you know how that made. That  made us kids all double cousins. Wherever they moved, we   d all move  pretty close together. The kids would want to. So anyway, Uncle Melvin  and Aunt Emma had moved down to Washington with their family. So  they left up there. People back then moved a lot. I guess they were  restless. I don   t know why. Maybe the farms weren   t good. But Uncle  Melvin moved, and in a year or two, why Dad moved. I know we left  around Bristow and came down to Washington, Oklahoma.  Most of my schooling, I walked a mile and a half and went to what is  called Old Washington. I just loved it, but of course, it is not there  anymore. Even my school teacher, Mrs. Kirby, I went to her grave.  She   s buried at Blanchard. She was a good teacher. She taught from the  first grade to the twelfth. If you think she wouldn   t bust them boys, you  8  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  J. Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  just better not fool with her because she would get them good. I   ve seen  her make that cousin of mine, double cousin   and he needed it   when  he was ten, eleven years old, made him bend over a seat and bust him  with her paddle   about that big (gestures)   because he was fighting  during recess. (Laughs) That   s the way it was back when I went to  school. But I didn   t go to school all that time. I got married at fifteen  years old. (Laughs)  How did you meet your husband?  (Laughs) At a Pentecostal Homeless meeting at night under a brush  arbor at Cole, Oklahoma. That   s where they always had the big meeting.  Of course, everybody came, you know. The ones that wanted to come to  church, then all the young people. He lived at Blanchard. Had just  moved up from Texas. My husband was raised in Texas, but he   s been  real nice about it, he was. We never fought over OU. (Laughs) But  anyway, that   s how I met him.  Got married at fifteen.  Got married at fifteen. Well, girls got married back then, young.  Younger than they do now.  Did you take a honeymoon?  No. I never even knew anything about a honeymoon until I was thirty  years old, probably.  And what did he do for a living?  Mostly worked in the oil fields, in the early oil fields. And then we ran a  milk bottling plant. We did, raising our family, most of it. Just out of   I  started to say Blanchard, I   m telling so many stories   out of Southeast  Oklahoma City. We had a dairy farm. We sold bottled milk. Had a  homogenizer and a pasteurizer and lots of work. (Laughs) We only got  rid of it when Brent and Jocelyn got married.  About what time period was that?  What time, Jocelyn, would that be?  Well, about 1970.  You had it a long time, then.  Well, it was hard to get help. My husband had to do the   we had  9  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  J. Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  everything automatic. We had automatic milkers, but you had to get the  cow ready to be milked. For one man, he   d get up every morning at four  and four thirty. I   d get up, and I only had Brent left. The rest of the boys  had finished college. Yeah, the two oldest boys went to work for  Continental Oil Company. They stayed with them for I don   t know how  long. The second one up there (gestures to photographs), I   ve got to brag  on him. He just gave OU three million dollars. Yeah, sure did. He   s the  second one close to the top, but they   ve all done well. Let   s just say that.  None of them are broke. (Laughs)  And they all helped with the dairy, though.  Well, the young ones did. The old ones didn   t. We weren   t in the dairy  at that time, you know. But they were taught to work and think. They  were good kids. I never had any trouble with them. I was the boss. I  loved them and they got their way if it was right. If it wasn   t, they didn   t  get their way. They didn   t cross me too much. Of course, I love them all  and they love me. I   ve got a lot of good daughter-in-laws, you know. We  all have a good time. They   ve always gave that party for me. I wasn   t  even going to tell you how much it costs.  You don   t have to.  (Laughs) Plenty. We had a hundred and   was it, eighty, guests?  Yeah, I think so.  That   s a lot to say happy birthday.  (Laughs) We had a steak dinner for everyone. Everybody just partied,  you know. Old and young and all that was able. (Laughs) But growing  up in Oklahoma, well    But me, I love the farm. I don   t really care for  city life. Never did, didn   t even like it as a kid.  What was the name of your dairy?  The Coldiron.  Coldiron, okay.  Coldiron   s Drive-in. See, people brought the   they came out and picked  the milk up. I still own my old home. I wouldn   t sell it for period. We   re  about two blocks south of Southeast Twenty-Ninth and Grand  Boulevard. If you   re ever out that way and you go to make that turn, my  place is two blocks or something down there. When I left there, I   d lived  there for sixty years, but the boys decided I was too old. They have the  10  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron   say so . Naturally, Brent being the youngest one you know, they bribed  him. (Laughs) This is a brand new little one-bedroom duplex.  It   s nice.  But it   s nice. Very nice. I   ve got everything in here. She   s my youngest  daughter-in-law and I just love her. (Laughs)  So how many children did you have?  Oh, I had seven. Six boys and a girl. I had three boys, then I had my  daughter. She was over here yesterday. She lives about six or seven  miles, or something over in here. Somewhere in the trees. (Laughs) Then  I had three more boys.  Was church, religion very important?  Well, we   re all Baptists, most of us.  Since you met at a Pentecostal     Well, my mother was Pentecostal   oh, you bet. Yes, my mother was  Pentecostal. Always was. Of course, I went to a Pentecostal church, but  my husband, being from Texas coming up here, he was kind of different.  For all during the Depression   they think they   re having a Depression  now. They ought to live through the real Depression.  Tell us about it.  Well, you had to be very conservative with everything you had. You  couldn   t blow and go or you   d probably go very hungry. We never took  a penny from the government. That was one thing I would not go for. No  welfare, no nothing. We lived in Oklahoma City, and I had one, two,  three boys. You know, the WPA  Works Progress Administration  began  to hire people   men. Three dollars a day was a lot of money. I honestly  didn   t know what WPA meant. I hadn   t been around anything like that.  My husband had worked in the oil fields and it paid pretty good money  but the oil field began to slow down. It wasn   t a lot of work unless you  was on a drilling rig. They just kind of quit drilling. We lived down on  Southeast Fifteenth Street. Charles, that   s my husband   s name, he was  out of work and he walked down there to see what they was doing. The  man that did the hiring that worked for WPA said,    Would you like a  job?    He said,    Sure.    They were digging a ditch he told him, three  dollars a day digging a ditch. He didn   t tell him anything else. I was  really excited, three dollars a day  Gee. He went to work right there in  front of the house, practically.  11  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  The next morning, here   s where the fun starts. The next morning, a big  truck backed up to my back door. I thought,    Gee, wonder who that is.     They began to pile this food out and it was canned beef and canned food.  I   d never seen anything    I said,    You made a mistake. I didn   t order  this. Good grief. I can   t pay for this.    He said,    Ma   am, you don   t have  to pay for it.    I said,    What?    He said,    No, if your husband works for  WPA, you get this once a month.    He said,    Since he   s just now starting  to work       I liked to have fainted. I said,    You pick that right back up  and put it back in that truck. I won   t accept it.    They said,    We can   t  ma   am. If we do, we get fired.    Well, that would give me something else  to think about. I said,    Oh, what a mess.    Charles come in for lunch. I  said,    Did you know you   re working for the government?    He quit   (Laughs) He quit. Yeah. Worked a half a day and that was it. He quit  and we was out of a job, now.  So then, we decided that we would go to California. My sister had went  out there, and maybe we could find work. So we went to California. The  work was no better and no different. You got thirty cents an hour for  trimming grapes. That was it. They didn   t offer any welfare. (Laughs)  Some people were getting welfare. We didn   t like it. I might as well tell  the truth because it is my fault. I didn   t like the foreigners. I   d never  been around them, wasn   t used to them. I said,    I thought this was  America. I thought it was our country. I didn   t know it was it was China  and Japan and India,    and none of them could speak a word of English. I  was pretty awful. (Laughs) So we left and come back to Oklahoma. The  oil fields had opened up pretty good so he went to work again. Then it  slowed down again. Of course, my sister was out there writing home,  writing Momma, writing me   begging us to come back. She was out  there just him and her. His folks were all out there, so you know. They  never did come back. She smoked and it killed her. Me and my daughter  flew out there. I got a call   how long has Alphalea been gone, Jocelyn?  Four years or something like that.  I don   t know, maybe longer. Maybe more like almost ten, I bet.  Well, I got a call and they said,    Momma is awful sick, Aunt Exie, and  she wants to see you.    So I told Ladona, I said,    You can go with me.     Of course, her children are grown and all married. So we got a plane the  next morning and we flew out there and went to the hospital. She was  sitting up in bed and feeling pretty good. Of course, that was a relief. We  stayed about five days. At that time, we were in the dairy. I needed to be  back to work. I said,    Well, you   re doing okay, now. We   re going to  have to go.    She understood that. I left really good   my heart felt good  about it. I got a call about the time I got home, she   d passed away. Yeah.  In the hospital.  12  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  It was good you got to spend time with her.  Just got to see her and spend some time. I didn   t even go back for the  funeral. No use to. Her husband is gone now so they   re both gone. Her  youngest son, though, Roger Mitchell, she just had two boys and three  girls. But he came back for my birthday party. Yeah. And that   s about it.  You live from year to year, year to year, do the best you can.  Do you remember your first automobile ride?  I do. I   ll tell you what it was. I   ll always remember that. Our doctor was  Dr. Goad. Momma would say,    Oh, Doc Goad.    He first came in a  buggy. It must have been about 1921 or 22. The new Ford cars came out.  That was the prettiest thing. He drove it by to stop and put the mail in  the box. Of course, I flew out there like a turtle dove to see it, you know.  I well remember around the headlights, all this gold, whatever it was  they put on it. Oh, it was so pretty. The lights were not on, but you could  certainly see them. He had the little arm that stuck out like that. I guess it  was like a fan or something. I don   t know. It was all trimmed up in this  gold. Even on the back of it. I guess it was a touring car because there  wasn   t no glasses in it. You could run your arm all the way through. It  was just right to deliver mail in, you know. That is the first that I ever  saw. Of course, I got to get up and sit in the seat. Can you imagine that?  (Laughter)  Yeah, I had   I forget, now. I had someone in the hospital for quite a few  years back that I visited with. I came down the stairs and was waiting.  The young doctor that was treating this person, his name was Goad. I  said,    You know, when I was a kid growing up in Atoka       I said  twelve miles east of Atoka.  Dr. Goad was your doctor that treated you when you had that  meningioma for the X-rays. You had that radiation treatment on your  tumor. That was Dr. Goad.  Was that Dr. Goad. He said he thought maybe   what I was going to say,  I visited with him. I was telling him about when I was a kid, you know.  He said he   d heard of his mother speak of a Dr. Goad somewhere. I said,     Well, he was down there twelve miles east of Atoka.    (Laughter)  You mentioned earlier that you made biscuits?  Oh, yes.  Who taught you how to do that?  13  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Oh, watching Momma. When you grew up on the farm, you cooked  everything. I didn   t see a loaf of bread until I was grown. We didn   t go  to the grocery store like people do today. You   d go get a hundred  pounds of flour, and we had our own cornmeal ground, and coffee. That  was about it. The rest of it, you had chickens and eggs. In the  summertime, we had lots of fried chicken. In the wintertime, we had lots  of ham. Of course, Dad would butcher two or three, at least three, good  hogs. That   s how I grew up. (Laughs)  Did a lot of canning?  Momma did. I did, too, after I married. Oh, yes. I canned 800 quarts one  year.  Mercy.  But that was when I had a pressure cooker. They came in style, you  know. That was so much easier than cooking. Put it on and pressure it  for ten minutes, man you   ve got it canned.  As long as it doesn   t blow up.  No, I never had one to blow up. Some women did. Yes, they did. They  didn   t know what they was doing. (Laughs) You don   t fool with them  once you get them going. Depends on what you   re cooking. I would do a  lot of green beans, Kentucky Wonders. You have to adjust your fire  where it stays on ten. Then you won   t have any problems. Then you let  it cool. Don   t get in a hurry. You let it cool and all the pressure go down.  Open it up just a little, until you get it all off and then you can lift the lid  up. Otherwise, you   ll get scalded. You have to know how to handle it.  Did you have a cellar?  You bet, I did. I   m still a big coward. I   ve got a safety room back there  the boys built. Safe room. I haven   t been in it, but I   ve got it. The girls  say that it   s full of clothes. (Laughter)  Tell me how you make biscuits.  Oh, you know how to make biscuits   You tell me how you make biscuits.  Well, now this day and time, you buy the self-rising flour, of course. I  put so much   depends on how many you   re making. Put so much flour  14  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  in a bowl, and then you put your shortening in there. You   re talking  about my house.  Yeah, you   re house   Oh, yeah. Well, I buy the best   not the cheap lard   the best. I just take  a spoon, and depending how busy I was, just grab me some and put it in  the bowl with the flour. You mix it real good, just real good, with this  hand. Then you put your buttermilk in there. You take your hand out and  get your big spoon. Then you just put enough buttermilk on it to where  you can handle it good. Then you lay it out on your board with flour on  it and pat it. Sometimes I   d cut it out if I was going to have company.  Otherwise, I   d pinch it out. That   s how you make biscuits. (Laughter)  But you have to let them rise, now. Don   t put them in the oven. Go  ahead and make them earlier and have it warm back where you can set  them back. They can be just warm because if you make them too hot,  you   ll make a failure. Make them warm, and when they go to rising real  good, put them in a good hot oven, and you got biscuits. (Laughs) I  made so many   oh, god. I   ve never done anything but make biscuits.  Biscuits and gravy and scrambled eggs. The kids hardly ever would eat  cereal. They wouldn   t eat it. They ate biscuits and gravy and either  bacon or ham or something. It was good, you know.  Sounds good.  I never seen a box of cereal all my growing up. We didn   t know what it  was. Well, farmers couldn   t go to town to buy anything like that. You  had to buy something substantial. Now-a-days, they   ve got a car, it   s  different. You can do anything you want to. That   s the reason times have  changed. Brother they   ve changed, too. (Laughs) But I did lots of  cooking. Biscuits were just one of them.  Did you do much sewing?  Not very much. Didn   t have one to sew for but one daughter. I didn   t do  much sewing, no.  Quilting?  Oh, yes. Yes  I quilted off and on all my life. Just before the last count I  had, I quilted a hundred and fourteen, I think it   s 114. I give all the kids  quilts. I made each one of them a quilt, special, before I knew I was not  going to do any more quilting. When we closed the dairy down, down  there, and I lost my husband   he was ninety-four, but I lost him. I  decided that I would   oh, I was an antique collector. You name it, and I  collected. (Laughs) I   ve given it all away now, to all the kids. Everyone  15  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  got what they wanted. I have one that has a ranch out here at Wellston.  You ought to see his house. He   s got it fixed up so pretty. I gave my last  antique couch away to a grandson yesterday. I   m glad I did. I have more  room in here. I belong to the, I still do, to the Doll Collectors of  Oklahoma. I   m a doll collector. I gave all them to my daughter.  Speaking of dolls, did you have a Bellmon Belle doll?  No, but I had a lot of good French dolls.  And you were a Bellmon Belle, too, weren   t you?  I was. (Laughs) I kind of lost interest. I kind of lost interest, but I was.  Back in the sixties, seventies?  I guess, so. Yeah.  So you had lots of dolls. How many did you have before you started  getting rid of them?  I had a hundred. Yes. I bought dolls here and there and everywhere.  They were   everything but the French dolls. The American dolls were  reasonable. Not cheap, but reasonable. The French dolls were not  reasonable. (Laughs) But I had a few French dolls. I bought a few  Shirley Temples. I just gave my daughter three yesterday. I   ve only got  one Shirley left. Gee, they   re awfully high right now. I   ve got one about  that high. I used to have one that high. I had two big dolls, Shirleys.  Well, Shirley was kind of my age of doll. I guess, I don   t know, I  haven   t tried to make connections with them, but I imagine the Doll  Collectors of Oklahoma are still in business. On North Douglass in  Oklahoma City, someone built a   oh, what do you call it when you take  your dead people to have them buried?  A mortuary?  Yeah, a mortuary. He built a small mortuary out there. I was only there  one time, and I went to a friend   s funeral. His wife was a president of  our doll collection at that time. I never did take office with it because I  was in the dairy business and I just didn   t have the time. It takes   you  can spend a lot of time. Those women, you know   did you know that  every one of the women that I knew, now are dead. I had four of them,  and they   re all dead. Two of them smoked cigarettes, my very two best  friends.  And you didn   t?  16  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  They would never let me even know they were smoking. I could smell it  on them. I never mentioned it to them. What good would it do? But  they   re gone.  What do you think your secret is?  (Laughs) I don   t know. I never even thought about it.  Making biscuits.  Maybe that   s right. Maybe raising boys. I raised some good citizens.  And they   re smart ones, too. I   ve got a son that   two of them. One of  them came in here real early this morning and said,    Mom       I was  watching the news, which is no good, he said,    Mom, I   ve got an early  hearing in Norman. I   ve got to go.    He just came to the door. I said,     Well, drive careful.    That   s about what I always say.  Describe a typical day for us.  For me?  A typical day for you, now.  Oh, for me, now.  How early do you get up?  Oh, well I take two medicines. What do I take, Jocelyn?  You take a thyroid medicine.  I take a thyroid. I   ve been taking it about fifteen years, probably. And  what else?  Blood pressure. That   s it.  Yeah, I take a blood pressure.  And that   s it?  And that   s it.  That   s good.  I get up at six o   clock in the morning to take it, and I take it at six at  17  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  night and six in the morning.  So during the day, what might you do?  Very little. Sometimes I get bored. My daughter-in-laws   Jocelyn helps  in the   their office is about two miles over here. She helps Brent, that   s  my son, in an office a lot. But the girls come. They don   t come every  day, but they have different days. One of them will be here Wednesday,  the one that lives out   oh, I guess she   s about forty miles   at Wellston.  My daughter comes. She   s closer, you know. In fact, her daughter, my  granddaughter, is the first girl that ever graduated from West Point.  Really?  Yes, and she   s from Edmond up here. Yeah. She came here not too long  ago to visit her mother. She married a West Pointer. They live up close  to Washington. He works, you know. She   s not working, now. Her other  daughter lives in Dallas. The West Pointer, it   s her daughter that married  and got the babies. No, I   m sorry   it   s the third girl. I get them mixed  up. It is Karen that has got the baby that is going to Japan. They just  went up there to visit and console them a little bit. (Laughs) I said,     She   ll get over it.     You   ve got a lot to keep up with.  Oh, yeah, if I try to. (Laughs)  You get lots of phone calls.  I get quite few phone calls, yes.  And do you read, much?  Not anymore. My eyes got too bad. I just gave it up. I was reading a lot.  Of course, television takes care of that. Remember, I am a Western fan.  If it is not a Western, I don   t want to see it.  Big John Wayne, then.  Yep, big John Wayne. Got his picture right back there. Got two of them.  Jeff Chandler and John Wayne were my two favorites. I didn   t buy  them. The kids did that. (Laughs) I didn   t buy them. But anyway, yes,  definitely Western.  Were you a fan back in the early days, then, too?  18  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Always Western. Of course, we didn   t have a television until, let   s see,  was about sixty years ago. Before then, I read. I   d read. Historical, I love  anything about history. Anything historical, I   ll go for it. The more  historical it is, the more I   ll go for it. I just always loved anything like  that. I really don   t care for modern stuff. Very little do I care for it. I like  a pretty dress, new shoes or something like that. I really don   t care for it.  I love history. And I   ve been to nearly, lacking a few I haven   t made, but  I   ve been to nearly all the early president   s homes. I   ve been twice to  Mount Vernon.  I don   t know why the overseer noticed me. I was up there visiting, me  and my daughter-in-law. We went to Mount Vernon and it was Sunday  evening and they were letting guests come in. They didn   t walk in and  stand there just a minute to let anybody   they   re just pushing, you  know. I knew that he was the overseer. I could see it on his cap. I said to  him,    Would you mind if I just stepped outside and waited and let this  crowd leave? I came to see Mount Vernon.    He said,    Yes, let   s get this  bunch of cattle out of the way.    You know, he took me through that, and  my daughter-in-law, and he explained things to us that I read about, but  is hard to recognize. He let me even go upstairs and wouldn   t let no one  else. They do, now, but back then, they wouldn   t.  That was   well, Arnold and Wanda lived up in New York. That   s been  a long time ago. The little stairs were about that wide. I said,    How did  Martha make it up those steps, as wide as she was?    (Laughter) The  reason, one thing, the reason George married her   she was a very rich  widow. Very rich. So now, they let the public   of course, they charge.  They just let so many come in at a time. You take a crowd of pushing     you could break something that you never could replace. They just all  seemed to be in a hurry rushing around. I love anything like the history,  yes. I   ve seen most of it.  If you could go anywhere, where would you go?  Gosh, that   s a big question. Some place I hadn   t been. (Laughs) For  sure.  Nowhere on your bucket list?  Pardon?  Do you have anything on your bucket list, anything you wished you  could do?  Oh, not anymore. I have got sense enough to know that my travelling  days are cut pretty short. If I   d go someplace, I   d probably fly. I   m  19  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldirong  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  mostly interested in my family. They   re good kids, and I   ve got lots of  good grandkids. They   re just like my kids. I   ve got one grandson that  lives in   gosh, where does Greg live in Florida?  He lives in Key West.  Right down on that oceanfront. He   s my oldest grandson. I   ve got a big  box of shrimp from him about a week ago, about that high. Still got  shrimp in the freezer, cooked, that I   ve got to eat. I said,    Greg, you   ve  got to stop this.    I called him and he said,    I   m not going to stop it,  Grandma.      Phone Rings   That was my son that   s got the ranch out there. He comes in. He   s got a  business here in town, but he takes me to lunch.  That   s good. We want to go back a little ways and talk a little bit more  about your early school days. Did you ever get in trouble?  No, never got a    Well, I talked too much. (Laughs) My teacher that  shut me up   she did this to all of them, but I know I got more of it than  anybody. She   d make you take your book and stand on your knees in  front of the class on a wooden floor. This was Ms. Kirby I was talking  about. That was the only teacher   well, I did have one more. She had  very bad cross eyes. She only lasted one year. We got Ms. Kirby and she  drove from thirty miles out, about thirty miles, she drove there to teach. I  know she didn   t make very much, but she taught there until I finished  out the eighth grade. And that   s as high as I went.  So what about this on your knees?  You had to stand on your knees and learn your lesson out of your book,  or you   d wished you had. I never got paddled, but I only got in trouble  over talking. That got me in trouble. (Laughter) But anyway. We all  waited in one classroom. You know how embarrassing that is, if you had  to be called up and kneel down. Them floors was about that wide. They  were hard. I hated seeing the old schoolhouse go. They all moved to  New Washington, it was called back then. Now it is just Washington,  where we used to go on Saturday after I grew up, and get an ice cream  cone for a nickel. Guess where you had to go get it at? In the drugstore,  Red Cross Drugstore. Only one that was in town. It wasn   t like it is now.  There was a grocery store. You bought your groceries, Mom and Dad  did. We   d come to town on Saturday. If Dad wasn   t busy working on the  farm or something, he   d drive in. Of course, not only would we load up  and come in, we   d pick all the neighbors up that was on the road that  20  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  wanted to go.  Did you ever go to Oklahoma City as a little girl?  Well, yes, but we went there on business. We lived about, I don   t know,  thirty or forty miles from    No, we went to Norman, first. We lived  about thirty miles from Norman. My dad was the best watermelon raiser  in that country. He just had a knack. He could raise good watermelons.  He would load up a big load of watermelons, and that was your summer  money. You had to do something, you know. On the farm, there wasn   t  no job you could get back then. Some of them went to the wheat harvest,  but Dad never did. He   d drive to  Norman . We   d leave real early. He   d  let me go with him. I would hold the team. You could park, back then,  now, right on the main street. We had a mule team.  In Norman, you could just drive in and park while you had the sale.  Daddy would sell his big watermelons, fifty cents apiece. I   ve seen  women come by there, pushing a baby buggy   which, I bought one just  like it   you know these big wicker buggies? To put dolls in. My  daughter has got it. (Laughs) They   d pull the baby up in the back of it.  They   d start crying, probably. And they put that watermelon right in the  front, there. (Laughs) And push it on down the street. I   ve seen that  more than once. Daddy would sell all the watermelons that he could, you  know, and we   d be there all day. Of course, to me, it was fun. I was a  great big girl, then. I was ten years old. I was the only boy Dad had, you  know. I was tomboyish enough. I was very tomboyish. You mention it,  I   d try. (Laughter) But anyway. He   d make him some summer money.  Sometimes in the fall, we   d sell a big load of potatoes like that. Grow  more than what we  needed . It was just me and my baby sister at home.  So it was just us two girls, Mom and Dad. He   d take sweet potatoes,  especially. Sweet potatoes sold real good.  Did your mules have names?  Our mules?  Yeah, do you remember if they had names?  Kit and Beck, yeah  But you stayed away from mules, they kicked. They  may act friendly with you, but watch out. I rode to school on a horse  one   well, maybe two or three years. Her name was Snip. I   d carry her  corn for lunch. You had to carry your, we called it dinner. You carried  your dinner bucket to school. There wasn   t such thing as anything in  school to eat, unless you brought it. All the kids   I lived, gosh, I don   t  know. Daddy moved about three miles from school. I rode, you know     21  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Daddy bought me this little mare. She got real fat in the summer. She  was real good but coming home in the evening, she was hungry. Of  course, I just took so much corn for her to eat at noontime while I ate my  dinner. All the rest of their kids were sitting out in the yard eating their  dinners, you know. We sat down under a tree or something, nothing  fancy.  So right around the bend, I   m talking about Blanchard, now. We lived  up pretty close to Blanchard. I went to Buffalo School, my last  schooling. As we turned the corner, it was real sandy. She knew it every  time. (Laughs) I wouldn   t be expecting it, and she   d jump into a lope  and off I   d go. I   d stop and holler. She didn   t care. She went on down to  the house. (Laughter) When I got there, she   d be standing there in the  front yard. I told Momma,    I   m going to kill that horse, Momma      (Laughs) Yeah, but anyway. That   s about it. I started dating my  husband, and we went together fifteen months before we married.  What would you do for a date?  Well, we   d go to a movie. It cost fifteen cents, but he usually had fifteen  cents. (Laughs) He didn   t even have a car, he borrowed his brothers. Of  course, I got acquainted after I got up older, you know. There was  always kids in the country you could meet at church. Mostly, you go to  church. You go to church and you meet, you know. I even dated some  boys before I married, but you know, I liked them okay as a friend, but I  wasn   t thinking about marrying them. I wasn   t thinking about marrying  at all. (Laughter)  Did you do much dancing?  That   s all we did. Every Saturday night. That   s something I liked to do,  was dance. Mostly square dancing. We had a couple that could call the  sets. Then we had friends that would come and just volunteer. The way  they did that   now, in my time there would be couples in the  community that loved to dance, and younger people, married in their  thirties or something like that, and they   d give a dance. Clear the living  room out, which wasn   t very hard to do. They   d give a dance. Of course,  you didn   t have no way to advertise it. It went from mouth to mouth, but  it got around real fast. (Laughs) They   d have a big crowd.  One thing I remember, the boys would all go outside to smoke and drink  whiskey, but the girls never went. I remember that. I had to slip off from  Momma. We   d go to church, and I   d be sitting on the back row and I  had these cousins, double cousins, boys. He   d come and sit down beside  me and say,    We   re going to go, Exie. If you   re going to go with us,  you   d better come on.    About the time he left, I   d be right behind him.  22  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  I   d get in trouble over it, but I   d go anyway. (Laughs) We mostly square  danced.    Buffalo gal, won   t you come out tonight to dance by the light  of the moon?    A lot of them, a lot of them square danced.  How would your mother punish you when you got home?  With a strap  She   d jerk the cover off me come Sunday morning and get  a couple licks before I grabbed it. (Laughter) Momma was very  religious. She was a very good person, but she went at it the wrong way.  I never did nothing like that to my boys, girls   no way. No way. I raised  them different. They didn   t give me no problems, and they didn   t get no  whippings. I think their dad whipped one or two of them one time, but  that was it. I seen that wasn   t going to prove anything, you know. But  back in my day, the older people, they were pretty tough on the young  ones. Of course, they ought to get that tough, now-a-days. But you   ve  got to start when they   re little. Mostly talking to them is the best. Just  talk to them.  What were holidays like?  Oh, we had big dinners, mostly big dinners. Momma never made much  out of Christmas. She thought it was probably sinful. You know  (Laughs). But we   d have a big dinner. Mostly something like that. We   d  always have a dinner, Thanksgiving and Christmas. We   d have some of  the kinfolks in, whoever wanted to come, or something like that.  Different ones. My parents were getting pretty old when I came along.  So you could get by with more?  Well, yeah, I could get by   slip off, you know. Of course, I had my  double cousins who were twin girls. I was only fifteen, but they were  eighteen. I went along with them. It was Momma   s sister   s girls. She  wasn   t too tough on me, you know. She   d quarrel at me. I didn   t pay any  attention to it. (Laughs) But after I got married and everything, no.  Never had no problems. If Momma said something I didn   t like, I just  didn   t pay any attention to it. I was coming into   when I got married,  and the country was changing    You know how it was. It was changing.  I decided I would change with it.  So you were fifteen, then. You got married just before the Depression hit,  then. Right in there.  Back then, I didn   t pay any attention to the Depression. You couldn   t get  a newspaper    I liked to read. All we   d take would be Farm. There used  to be an Oklahoma Farmer Stockman. I guess I read that all my life  because Dad would take that. Dad liked to read. (Laughs) He was a  23  Bishop  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  Baptist preacher in his young days.  How old was your husband when you got married?  He was about twenty-one. He was about seven years older than I am.  He robbed the cradle.  Oh, yeah. Most people married young back then. I had more freedom. I  was my own boss. Charles didn   t try to boss me. He let that slide. Of  course, when Don came along   he was the first one. He and the second  one up there, I told you, they   re all rich to be honest with you, but he   s  the one that   s got the most money. They   re just real close together. Real  close. I think about seventeen months between those two early ones.  Remember, I breast fed every one of them. We didn   t know what a  bottle was. I could, and I did. They grew up healthier, you know. I think  that   s the way the Lord intended it, or he wouldn   t have put them there.  (Laughter)  Exie, did you know any famous people?  Well, I   ve seen a few famous ones, but I only said hello to Lindy   Charles Lindbergh . (Laughs) When my third boy was born, we had  moved   you move where the work is. We had moved closer to  Oklahoma City. Where the airport sits right now, we lived about a  quarter mile. I   m going to measure like that   right straight east. This  couple had built this brand new little house. It was real nice. I don   t  know what happened, but something went wrong. They never did live in  it. They put it up to rent. They wouldn   t sell it. We tried to buy it, but  back then, the airport was just beginning out there.  One morning, Lindy and his wife came through. He was just as friendly  as anybody. Just waiting on a plane, and one plane took off and another  one was coming in. They walked out there and waved at everybody and  shook hands with the ones that were closest to the   they had a fence to  keep everybody else out. I said hello, and I had read some of her books.  She had a pretty sad life. I didn   t know that they owned land in Hawaii.  Did you know Lindy was buried in Hawaii? He was. It made my third  son, he was over there on a trip, and he was looking for Lindy   s grave,  and he found it out there, and a whole bunch of weeds growing up  around it. It made him so mad that he came back and almost got thrown  in jail. By golly, they took it and cleaned it up and made something out  of it. Now, it is a family deal. His wife and, I guess he   s still got lots of  boys. He had a bunch of boys. They had three or four boys, she did.  I was up there visiting this same couple when that little boy was  24  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  J. Coldiron  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Bishop  Coldiron  kidnapped.  So, did you know Wiley Post?  I did. He was there a lot. Wiley Post. Well, we lived about a quarter of a  mile of where the old airport used to be. It is all gone, now. He was there  all the time, but he was busy. He was talking to this guy, and trying to  raise money, I   m sure. Talking to that guy, talking to this guy and  talking to that guy. I   ve seen him a number of times. You just see  somebody and you just wave at them, you know. People wouldn   t ride  an airplane back then. They were too scared  (Laughs) They wouldn   t  ride an airplane. They wouldn   t ride them, no  We weren   t going  anywhere to ride one, so, you know. I   ll tell you how long it has been     Don was four years old. He is my oldest one up there.  So that would be about 1932?  He lives in Houston. I talked to him an hour yesterday, I bet. But we  were talking later politics. (Laughs) Oh, I seen Wiley Post a number of  times. But you just speak and go on, say hi, you know. He was there. I  didn   t like them planes either, because they didn   t have any hood over  them. We took a ride in one. It wasn   t with him. It was with another  young man that was giving rides for four dollars. We took a ride one  Sunday evening. There is nothing over you. It would blow your head off.  We flew down around Norman, and I seen the Canadian River. Just like  that, you know, they take you. Trying to get a crowd to come out.  Couldn   t get nobody. Nobody had four dollars.  But  Thomas  Braniff, you know. I know some stories that I won   t tell.  They   re confidential and they may hurt somebody that is living at this  day and time. Not worth it, not necessary. They   d do anything to try to  make a dollar. It was Braniff that was   it was his airport, trying to raise  money. That   s where the problem would be, if I told something. I   m not  going to tell it. No, I   m not. I   ve kept it this long. I   m just going to keep  it from now on. (Laughter) He might have great-grandchildren.  It   s better to just leave it out.  Yes, very much so. Of things he did   you can kind of guess what it was.  I want to know what is your motto, your philosophy in life?  Oh, be honest. That   s one thing. Be a good citizen. I love my country. I  would, right now, pick up a gun and fight for it. I think we did the right  thing when we come here and people started out right. You can   t make  some people do what you want them to do. I   ve never heard anybody  25  Finchum  Coldiron  Bishop  Coldiron  Bishop  Coldiron  run the country down in front of me because, man, I   d pick them up on  that quicker than you can   t believe. I   ve got a temper, too, now. I might  as well admit it. Pretty good one. But I just wish everybody would try  not to be   I don   t know. I don   t have no word for it.  Our country is going to the dogs, I   m afraid. We   ve forgot all the good  old words and deeds that our great-grandparents knew and taught.  Everybody isn   t, but there is enough bad seed out there that it is hurting  the young people. Just look what is happening in these big cities. It   s  awful  It will soon get so that, I think, unless something is done that   s  got the power to do it with   you   ll be guarding your own home. The  country is gone to the dogs. That   s the way I figure it. (Laughs) It needs  a lot of good honest men running it, and looking at something besides  their bank account. That   s what this country needs.  Another Henry Bellmon?  No. I don   t think so. Henry didn   t have sense enough to run a country.  (Laughs)  If you had to give somebody advice about living a long life, what would  you tell them?  One thing, eat good healthy food. Don   t put something into you that is  not good for your system. Eat good, plain healthy food. Don   t depend on  medicines unless you get real bad shape, take an aspirin. That   s all I ever  took. (Laughter) You   ll be better and happier. I don   t know, just be  yourself. Just whatever is in you,  phone rings  and don   t have a phone  close to you. (Laughter)  I have another question for you. When history is written, what do you  want it to say about you?  Well, just say that I appreciate living, for sure. I never wanted to cause  more trouble than I had to. (Laughs) I was mostly interested in my  family. I wanted boys. There is no use in backing out on that. I was  raised up with five sisters, and all they can do is slap your jaws real  good, if you aren   t careful. And they were older than I. I declared I  wanted boys, and the Lord sent me boys. (Laughter) Six of them. I had  one girl. I wanted one girl. I didn   t really want more than one girl. I get  along a lot better with boys and things than I would with a house full of  girls for some reason. Maybe I was raised up with girls   maybe that   s  the reason. (Laughs)  But I was always a happy-go-lucky person. I don   t want to be frivolous  like that, but I like going to movies, and of course, I like Westerns. I  26  Bishop  Coldiron  Bishop  don   t know, I just like the country living. I just like living. I always did.  I still do. Being a hundred years old don   t have to stop you too much,  unless you   well, I   ve had a little head cold, haven   t felt all that great  the last couple weeks. Nothing that amounts to anything, you know.  Did you ever think you   d make it to a hundred?  To be honest with you   I   ll raise my hand and swear that I never gave it  a thought. Never. Never. I just wanted to be ready when the Lord came.  I think our country   and I   m not saying this to preach to anybody   I  think our country is getting in such a tremendous condition that if the  Christians go to being persecuted, the Lord will come. That   s what the  bible says. I think that they will be persecuted. I think there is a group  that wants to gain ground and gain hold. They   ll pick out the Christians  to persecute because they think they may take more off of them than  anybody else would.  I think we should be allowed a gun in our homes, especially a good  shotgun. And I   d use it, too, if somebody was trying to break in on me.  Yes, I would. You   re supposed to be able to defend yourself. I would  definitely use it. I am sorry for people that don   t take the time to bring  their children up right. I think that we   ve let too many foreigners come  in our country. I believe it, I just believe it. They   re bringing their  beliefs, their raising over here. Instead of wanting to become really what  an American is, they want to change it. They want what they believe put  in place. I don   t like that. I think if I was young again, I   d run for office.  (Laughter) See how much I   d get, how many I   d get.  But I do think that we are hurting our young people by bringing so  many   A young person will believe and take up after anything, because  they   re young. Their mind is clear and it is a little different as you get  older. Even in your thirties, you begin to change. You see the good  things and the bad things. I   ll tell you, our country is getting in a  dangerous condition. We thought it might have been dangerous back  when we was going to whip the   we shouldn   t have never whipped  them over there, our friends. (Laughs)  We   ve got to hire a president that   s got some sense. The one we   ve got  now, I don   t think has got any brains. I don   t know what he   s going to  do to our country. He   s trying to change it all together. That   s going to  cause a lot of trouble before it is all over with. Maybe he can   t do too  much damage until we have another election. (Laughs) I don   t know  who is going to run, but somebody better.  I take it you follow politics?  27  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Oh, do you think that? (Laughter) All the way.  And you still vote?  Oh, absolutely. Sure, I still vote.  Do you remember the first time you voted?  I can tell you, yes. I   ll tell you a little funny story. I married at fifteen.  My husband was always...like he believed   like politics, just what is  going on in the country. When he was young, he was very interested in  that. I would have to sit in the car while he went in to vote. That would  make me so mad. I was only fifteen and I couldn   t vote until I was  twenty-one. He only had to wait   we married in August. He might have  been twenty-one, his birthday. I haven   t kept up with that, for sure. But I  know he   d go in and vote, and I   d have to wait and that   d make me so  mad. I wanted to go and vote, too. (Laughter) Of course, I may have  voted and killed his vote, but you never know who was running.  (Laughs) You had to be twenty-one. I wouldn   t have turned twenty-one  until the twenty-first day of July of that year. But I always had a good  mind. I tried to use it in the right way, you know. I mostly put it into my  kids, the boys. It was always the boys.  And the business.  Oh, the business, yes. But that was just here and there. The business, it  was work. We just made a good living out of it, you know. Not anything  more. We had Trosper Park right there in front of our door. I leased that  off of Oklahoma City for twenty years. I had eighty acres there, and  that   s where we   d run the cows during the day. They ate Bermuda grass.  Go to the county fairs very often?  I used to always go and take the boys. I don   t even go to the State Fair  anymore.  Were they in 4-H or FFA?  No, they weren   t. They played football. They were all football boys  growing up, wanting to play football. But we always went. It was  different than it is now. I was thinking how funny it would be if I was to  take them out, and talk about the State Fair   the first time I was ever in  it, guess how much it cost. We always went to the State Fair, too. We  lived down at Washington and it cost fifty cents. We drove up here to  get in the gate. They charged fifty cents. Guess what they charged this  year. I bet you know. (Laughter) I didn   t go. I went last year, but I  28  Finchum  Coldiron  Bishop  Coldiron  J. Coldiron  Finchum  thought it was boring. I didn   t go back this year. The kids went, but they  didn   t stay very long. I don   t know what it is. That   s what way the  country is doing, just like that right there.  Now, when my boys was little, we went to the fair, always. I would take  a freezer full of ice cream. My husband hardly ever went because he   d  have to lose a day   s  work . He didn   t want to go anyway, because he  was working in the oil fields, always. That was before we bought or  settled down or had the dairy farm. Anyway, I would cook a lot of fried  chicken. Back then, I   d buy light bread. I would take a quilt and I always  had a baby. I   d set him on the quilt and I   d have a lot of good food. I  forget now, but I know I   d always have ice cream. I   d just give the boys  what little money they had. The rides only cost about ten cents. They  knew when to come back, let me know they was okay. They   d go ride  and then come back, maybe grab something to eat or something like  that. That   s the way we went to the fair when they were growing up.  Yeah. But we always went. Back then, you didn   t go somewhere and  buy ice cream. The city people did, but we weren   t city people. We were  country people.  You made your own?  Oh, absolutely. I   ve still got my freezer, except it is electric, now. We  have get-togethers out at my son   s ranch. He   s just like me. He just does  what I do. He always barbecues and he has Black Angus cattle. He  barbecues and he always makes a big freezer full of ice cream. Maybe  I   ll bring one or some of the other boys will. We still do that. Of course,  he has a big swimming pool, too. That entices the young ones, you  know. His kids are growing up. That   s one of them. The oldest one, I  gave that couch to. You didn   t see it. It was a very pretty antique couch.  It   d cost him about   oh, I don   t know what it   d cost. If you could find  one, which you probably couldn   t, but he was one of my earlier  grandkids that likes antiques. So he gets quite a few. That   s just about  my life story. I haven   t actually quit, yet. (Laughter) I   ve just slowed  down.  I thought you were going to say you were just beginning.  Yeah. (Laughs) I   ve just slowed down. My granddaughter is getting  married. I bought her a new   what do you call them wide bedroom  suits, Jocelyn?  King size.  A king?  29  Coldiron  Bishop  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  Finchum  Coldiron  King, yeah. Her and that boy she   s marrying aren   t bigger than crickets,  either one of them. I said,    What do you want with a king size bedroom  suit?       That   s what I want, Grandma     (Laughter) So I guess that   s what  she   ll get.  Still taking care of kids.  But my family are all good citizens. Worst comes to worst, yeah, we   d  fight for our country, yes. All of us.  I   d say you did a very good job, then.  I think so. I do. We all love each other. We   re friends and we have  friends. They have friends that come in. My friends are so old that    I  don   t drive anymore. I did this on my own. I seen I wasn   t seeing as well  as I was. I just bought a new high top, and I have the LTD, and I had a  pickup. I told one of the boys this morning, I said   not here, I was living  over there south of Twenty-Ninth and Grand Boulevard. I   m not living  over there, but I own that over there. It runs back in to Trosper Park. I  said,    I   m not seeing as well. I might accidentally have an accident and  kill a baby or a child. Kill anybody. I   m going to quit it.    So I just sold  every one. All at once, I sold every one of them. One man is still driving  my LTD. I said,    I know that LTD hates me, but I can   t help it. I had to  let him go.    (Laughter) Every time I see   it was green. I miss a lot by  not driving but the girls are good. They take me or buy for me or  something. About all I   ll buy is a few groceries. They   ll bring me in  Colonel Sanders chicken. We manage. I notice I haven   t lost any weight.  I   ve been here five years. Yeah. So I   m doing pretty good.  You   re doing great. We appreciate you sharing your stories with us,  today.  Well, I hope you get something out of it that helps you.  I will. It was a pleasure.  Need anything, just take my phone number and call me   Alright.  Goodness, yes.  -------  -------
