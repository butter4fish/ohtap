 Finchum  Bowden  Today is August 5, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University and today we   re in  Norman, Oklahoma visiting with Coyla Bowden who is 101. We   re  going to hear a little bit about her life. Thank you for having us. Let   s  begin with having you tell us when and where you were born.  I was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, June 21, 1912.  And were you born at home or in a hospital.  Home, I   m sure.  What did your parents do for a living?  My father was with Standard Oil, a subsidiary of Standard Oil. We  moved about every three years to a new oil field.  Mostly in Oklahoma or in other states?  Mostly in Oklahoma.  And where did you go to school?  Let   s see, where did I go? I went to Drumright, Oklahoma; Seminole,  Oklahoma; and one before that that I can   t bring to mind   Shawnee,  Oklahoma.  And how many were in your family? Brothers and sisters?  Seven. Was it six? Did that count the brother that died at seven? Okay.  5  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  And were you the   are you the oldest or     The oldest.  Oldest, okay. Did you graduate from high school in     In Seminole.  In Seminole, okay. And how did you end up in Norman?  My husband was sent here by his company. He was with a lumberyard.  When did you get married?  In 1936.  So right during the depression.  Yes.  Do you have any memories from that time period?  Yes, I remember a man stealing a loaf of bread from a bakery. They   d  put it in the window, and they arrested him for that. His family needed  that, but he was arrested.  And was that in     Seminole.  Seminole. How had you met your husband?  We worked in the same building, for different people, at Seminole.  So after high school you went to work?  Yes.  Okay. Doing secretarial work, or what?  Secretarial work. Went to work at a tag agency selling Oklahoma tags.  A long time ago.  For an attorney  6  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  In a Ford dealership.  Yeah.  Well, when you were growing up did you live on a farm?  Well, we did one time, yes. Let   s see, that was before I went to school.  I was just curious if you had chores when you were growing up.  We had a few.  Did your mother sew?  Oh yes.  Did she use the flour sacks or did she buy fabric?  Yes, the flour sacks.  Did she teach you how to sew?  Some, but not a lot.  Did she quilt?  Yes.  Back in those days people belonged to homemaker clubs. Did she belong  to one?  No.  Have you?  No.  No. So once you got married did you go on a honeymoon?  Yes.  And where did you go?  Let   s see, I believe it was Texas, south Texas. I haven   t thought about  that in a long time. (Laughter) Because that was a long time ago.  7  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  White  Bowden  White  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  And what kind of car back in those days?  I don   t remember what we had then.  Now your father probably had a Model T?  Yes.  Is that what you learned to drive on?  No. Did he teach you to drive?  Oh, no.  Wanda White is Coyla   s sister.   He didn   t teach any of us to drive. Fred taught me to drive, my husband  taught me to drive.  Just something they didn   t teach girls? Did he teach your brother?  I don   t think so.  I don   t think he taught anyone to drive.  The car was a precious commodity because he used that in his work. It  wasn   t a play thing where we were going to learn to drive it.  Then along came the war. Did your husband serve in the military?  He was in the marine corps, and on the East Coast.  And did you go to the East Coast with him?  Yes.   Where  on the East Coast?  North Virginia.  Virginia.  And I worked in the navy yard there.  Okay. Were you there when the war was over?  Let   s see, yes I was.  8  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bishop  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Finchum  Bowden  What was that like?  Well, celebrations.  Did dancing play a part in your     He didn   t dance. He did it a little, but he didn   t like to dance. There   s the  dancer.  Now you did quite a lot of square-dancing.  What?  You did a lot of square-dancing.  Well, yeah that   s right. He was a good square-dancer.  That   s when someone   s calling the moves for you.  Yes.  You just follow the instructions.  What did you do in the navy shipyard?  I was in accounting. It was a large office.  Did you live on base?  No, but it was government housing.  Did he serve overseas?  No, he didn   t have to.  Probably a little bit older than most at that time.  Yes.  At that time there were so many different people there in the office. It  was interesting and exciting to learn about all the different people.  Sure. Was that the first time you   d been out of Oklahoma?  No. We   d been to surrounding states. Let   s see, I   d guess we   d been to  California, Old Mexico, but we hadn   t been overseas. Let   s see, we   d  9  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  been to Cuba.  So once the war was over he decided to come back to Oklahoma?  Yes.  And have been here ever since?  Yes.  Once you moved here did you work?  Yes.  Did you work a good chunk of your life?  Yes.  Doing secretarial type work?  Yes, for a new car dealer.  And when did you retire?  When I was fifty.  Lucky  (Laughter)  Well, we moved to this house and I had the yard to do, and I told my  husband that I was going to retire first. (Laughter) So I did.  And did you have a hobby?  Gardening. I guess that was about it.  Did you can?  No.  Not that kind of gardening.  No, I didn   t can.  And did you learn to quilt?  No.  10  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Finchum  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Didn   t have time if you were working.  Yeah.  When did your husband retire?  In about 1972.  Then what did you do? Did you start traveling at that point?  Yes.  Do you have a favorite place you   ve been to?  Australia and Hong Kong, Tokyo.  We loved them all.  All in between, because he liked to travel. You just mention some place  you   d like to go. Well, when do we leave? (Laughs)  Is there some place left you   d like to go?  South Africa. They say it is beautiful there.  And I keep telling her it   s not too late.  No, so when are you going? Book you a flight and head on.  Yes, we   ve been to Africa but not South Africa.  No, both coasts     We went on a safari.     east and west coasts and the north coast. We haven   t been to South  Africa.  Well, it isn   t too late. Is this your traveling partner?  Yeah.  Is there a place you would not go back again?  There is a place or two that   s dangerous, and I just wouldn   t want to go  11  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  there.  I wouldn   t want to go back to Russia. I   m glad we went but I wouldn   t  want to go back there.  I doubt if it   d be dangerous.  No, I don   t think it would be, and I didn   t really care for India either.  No, the people are really poor there.  Your passport has quite a few stamps on it.  Yes it does. I have several passports.  Share with us a favorite memory you have from a trip.  Well, I kept a log on it, and some of the funny things were really funny,  and I can remember those. (Laughs) Getting into a new airport, and there  was a man with us that smoked cigars, and he   d start asking the natives  where could he get a cigar. Well, they   d tell him down here and then  over here. He   d go down there and it was another restroom. (Laughter)  They really didn   t understand English but they were doing the best they  could.  He   d go down there and there   d be another restroom. (Laughs)  Well, one of the best trips was when we went on an African safari  because we got to see all the wild animals up close and personal.  Mostly rear-ends. (Laughter) They   d run away.  Well, the lions did not though. They were lazy.  Yeah, they were.  And the cubs were so cute. You just wanted to get out and cuddle them,  but momma was right there. You wouldn   t dare leave the Land Rover.  (Laughter) One morning when we went out to look at the animals we  came upon a large herd of elephants and we just parked. They were  going to the river, and they were all around us. There were the mothers  and the aunties and all taking care of the little babies. It was really  interesting to see all that.  And those were what, you say?  12  White  Bowden  White  Finchum  White  Bowden  White  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bishop  The babies, you know     No, the animals.  The aunts as well as the mothers took care of the babies. They nourished  them.  Elephants.  Yeah.  And I remember the camels going by, and all you could see, you know,  was long legs. (Laughter)  And the giraffes were just beautiful. We just loved them all.  With your sister getting to travel with you, what   s that been like?  Very nice, because what I missed, she   d see, call attention to, you know.  And she   d have ideas about where to go.  We researched our trips pretty well before we went so we  were  prepared , you know. They would take us on side tours but we knew  other places to go and things to see, and believe me, we saw it all when  we went. Of course, it took us five trips to Hong Kong to see it all, but  we did.  Yeah, and in Hong Kong we had trouble making the cab driver take us  back to our hotel. Because someone parked right by us and I told them  we were staying in the   what was the hotel?  Well, we stayed at the Hilton one time.  Yeah.  And then that one time when we were supposed to come home and  something happened, and they had to bring us back to Hong Kong and  spend the day there, which the airlines paid for, we stayed at the Holiday  Inn then. So what we did, the minute we got to the hotel, we dropped our  bags and hit the streets, because every time that you go to Hong Kong,  when you leave then you say,    Oh my goodness, I wish I had bought  this,    you know,    That would just be a darling gift for someone.     Did you get anything in Hong Kong, did you go shopping?  13  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bishop  Bowden  White  Oh heavens, yes. (Laughs)  Oh yes.  And so when we went back there, well we hit the streets. I mean we  shopped and got everything that we   d missed the first time around.  We called a cab     Yeah.     and took off.  Because we knew just where to go, we   d been there so often.  But when we got ready to come back, we couldn   t make the cab driver  understand which hotel to take us to, but someone parked right next to  us and I could ask him.  Yeah, and he translated for us.  He said yes he spoke English so he told our cab driver.  But see these prints here are from Thailand. We love Thailand, too, and  those are all on leaves.  Yeah, they painted on leaves.  They painted on leaves, yeah. They   re hand-painted. The artist is very  well-known over there so we got some of those.  Did you ever learn another language?  A few words but not a lot.  Every time we went into a new country the tour guide would tell us     please    and    thank you    and    yes    and    no    and different things, and  we could write it out. I wrote it out phonetically, you know, so that I  could   I thought it was important to say thank you to people.  Do you remember any words that you learned?  I don   t     In Japan it   s    arigat     .  14  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  What?     Arigat      is    thank you    in Japanese. That I remember.  I   d forgotten that.  Yeah.  The traveling was just so interesting. Different people, different country,  and     One trip a year or more?  Well, a time or two we made two trips in one year, something came up.  The university had a tour one time to a small island off the coast of  Spain.  Oh yeah, Mallorca.  And it was a five or seven day trip. It was kind of a short trip. We  debated whether it was worth going, worth the money going all the way  over there for a few days. We decided yes and we went and it was worth  it. It was a good trip.  Yeah.  And let   s see. That   s where they had the bar     Yeah, and the windmill, and they broadcast the radio.  Up really high, you know, where you could see the ocean and  everything. We   d go in there, and the bartender, of course, he got so he  knew everyone. The second time you came, he knew where you were  from, and he   d say something about    The Oklahomans are here.     The Sooners, and they would interview us, because everybody was an  oil magnate or a cattle baron. (Laughter) So that was fun.  Yeah.  And while we were there we got to take side trips to Africa, to Algiers,  and to Madrid.  Yeah.  We took a daytrip to Madrid.  15  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Yeah, and each trip was different it seemed like. I   ve got the books in  there on it. Every once in a while I   ll get one out and read, what was it  that happened there? In fact, our travel guide called me one time wanting  the name of a hotel because he was planning another tour. He called and  said,    Did I have the name of that hotel so and so?    Fred said,    Oh, she  probably does,    and I looked it up and told him, because he wanted to  book that hotel.  And you kept a diary of your travels?  Yeah.  Is that what you did?  Yes.  It   d be interesting to read.  And sometimes I   d cut out a little flag of that country and put it on the  first page.  And I took lots and lots of pictures and put them in albums. Every time I  took a picture I had a code that I put down there, where it was and who  was in the picture. When we were on a bus tour, you know, when we   d  come in town if I could see the post office or a sign or anything that told  the name of the city or the country I would take a picture of that to start  out with.  And she made me an album of that trip. I have it in the bedroom in there.  I   ve got all those albums, and when I moved into a new house about five  years ago, that   s the first time I   d looked at it in years, but I had to take  all of them so I looked through everything. It was wonderful.  So did you go on a trip for your 100th birthday? How did you celebrate?  She had a big party at Legend   s  Restaurant , and a bunch of people  were there.  We celebrated. All the family came from Kansas and Nebraska, and I  don   t know where all.  Yeah.  And to top it off, Barry Switzer came to her house to wish her a happy  16  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Finchum  White  Finchum  White  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bishop  Bowden  White  birthday and visited with her for about an hour.  He brought me his picture. It   s in the other room.  An autographed picture.     To Coyla Bowden on her birthday,    and he came and talked about  forty-five minutes and got ready to leave, he says    Well, I   m going  home and I   m going to fix me a bacon sandwich.     Bacon and tomato sandwich. (Laughter) But she had OU (University of  Oklahoma) football tickets for more than sixty years.  Oh gosh.  And I think she missed two games in all that time.  A lot of good games.  Been there when it was sleeting.  Do you have a favorite memory from a game, or a favorite game you  remember?  Well, the year that I went down on the football field. She engineered  that. I was introduced down on the football field, and I   ve got a picture  of that in there.  She had her picture on the jumbotron.  Why were you introduced? Was there a special occasion?  Because I   d had season tickets so long.  Well, the year before they had just started honoring people who had had  season tickets for a long time. So I went over to the honor  here.  The  year that she was having her ninetieth, I went over there and asked them  how did they determine who was going to be honored. Well, they  couldn   t really tell me, you know. I thought they were kind of evasive  about that so I just kept going back and going back and going back. I  told them about her, and sure enough, the first game of that year they  played Alabama, which is a huge game and it was nationally televised  and everything, and they did her. They came up in the stands and got my  brother and I and Coyla and took us down on the field, and introduced  her and told about her and had her picture on the jumbotron. Then all of  the cheerleaders gathered around and they took her picture of that, and  17  Finchum  White  Finchum  White  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bishop  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bob Stoops gave her an autographed picture, among other things.  That   s cool.  I was just determined that during that year that something special   occur , you know, so I just kept going.  Did they win the game?  Oh yes, yes. (Laughter) That was the crowning glory right there.  She   s still going to the games. I   m not.  And where were your seats? Fifty-yard line?  No.  About on the forty, but we were on the top deck and she was walking up  all of those ramps all those years.  So you walked all the way up there every year?  Yeah, but then one year they changed it and I could ride the elevators.  When she was ninety-four she got an elevator pass. (Laughter)  And that   s when she could ride the elevator, too.  Well, the year before I said,    Maybe you could get a letter from your  doctor and we could ride the elevator,    and boy  she let me know right  off if I wanted to ride the elevator I could get my own letter. (Laughter)  But she did relent finally. I think she took pity on me because I was  panting. (Laughter) She was just skating right on through.  Have you always walked or been in pretty good shape throughout your  life?  Yes, yes. You know I get out there and do yard work. I think that keeps  me going.  Well, describe a typical day for us. What time do you get up?  About seven.  Okay.  18  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bishop  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Finchum  Bishop  White  Bishop  No, I don   t hurry getting up, and it   s twelve or one before I go to bed.  Without a nap?  Yeah, no nap.  No nap? My goodness. Where do you get your energy then?  I don   t know because I don   t eat a lot. I have to remember to eat three  meals a day.  It   s that one-a-day vitamin that she takes that gives her the  energy .  That   s her medication right there, this one-a-day vitamin.  That   s all you take a day?  I take a vitamin and a child   s aspirin.  No blood pressure medicine or cholesterol or any of that?  No.  That   s pretty amazing.  And what do you do during the day? What are some of the activities you  do?  Oh, just read. Go to the grocery store and whatever comes up. I have a  niece that comes and cleans my house every other time, and I do it once.  And she does it a lot better than I do. (Laughs)  And you still drive?  Yes.  Well, she has to because she   s got to get her hair cut on Thursdays. We  say we   re getting our hair done if we have to call the EMT. (Laughter)  Is that true?  You get your hair done together?  No, because I live in Shawnee, but she gets hers on Thursday, and I go  on Friday.  Every Thursday?  19  White  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Yeah.  Well, what time is your appointment set for on Thursday?  One o   clock.  One o   clock.  Well, it   s twelve-thirty now, but it was one o   clock a long time, but my  operator wants off. I   m his last one, and he wants to go home right after  that.  Have you been going to the same place for a long time?  Yeah, for quite a long time, and then I had been going to another man  for years. He up and died so I had to change then, but he had worked  with this man and knew how it had been done for so long so there was  really no change in it.  How close is the grocery store that you  use ?  Well, it   s over on Lindsey  Street , Homeland.  So not too far?  It isn   t too far.  I   m not familiar with Norman.  Well, it   s up on Main Street.  Probably not more than a mile, about a mile. Wouldn   t you say about a  mile?  Yeah.  Has Norman changed a lot since you first moved here?  Yes. There is so much traffic on my street now. When we first moved  out here, a long time ago, there was very little. Well, let   s see. It was a  gravel road when we moved out here. Then they black-topped it, and  years later they paved it, but it was a gravel road out here.  And what year was that, when you moved here?  20  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Nineteen fifty-seven.  Over fifty years. I   m sure the town has changed a lot in that length of  time, too.  Oh, yes.  If you square-danced, did they have a place that you would dance here  in town?  Yes.  Probably doesn   t anymore?  Yes, there   s still the same square-dance club. It   s still dancing. And a  sister, she and her husband belonged to three square-dance clubs, Jonice  and they had children. A neighbor took care of them while they were  square-dancing.  At what point did you think that you would live to be 100?  I never thought about living to be 100.  It just happened, huh?  Yeah. When I wasn   t looking. (Laughter)  What do you think are some of your secrets to longevity?  I think keeping busy out in the yard, and just walking.  Being optimistic helps, too.  Yeah.  Do you walk a little every day?  Mostly just in the house. Sometimes I   ll get out   I have cannas all  across the south side, and I   ll get out and cut the blooms off. In the fall I  cut them all down, take them to the street and they   re picked up.  Well, what   s left on your bucket list to do?  I don   t really have anything planned to do.  Besides going to South Africa.  21  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  (Laughter) Yeah, I   d still like to do that but that takes quite a bit of  stamina, to go on those trips, and I don   t think I want to just be worn out  every night, night after night, you know, after tours and things. I   m just  not interested in it. Taking it a little easier now. (Laughs) The neighbors,  they   re kind of amazed at some of the things I do around here, around  the yard.  It looks pretty good.  Well, my nephew just mowed over the weekend. He and his grandson  come and mow. He   s raising three grandchildren, but they   re lucky, the  kids are lucky.  When you work out in the yard do you do a hat and long sleeve shirts to  protect your skin?  I do long sleeve shirts, but a hat it just too hot.  Not worried about a sun burn?  No, I try to work in the shade.  Cool of the morning?  Yes.  Have you had any major illnesses?  Well, I had cancer a long time ago. I guess that   s about it. I had colon  cancer and didn   t know it. Yeah, I went in to the hospital for gallbladder  surgery, and the doctor, Dr. McCullough made a thorough examination,  and he found out that I had left colon cancer. So a week later I had that  taken care of, came on home, no treatments. They got it in time.  About how old were you?  I was sixty years old. That was in 1972, I think. That   s right, I was sixty  years old. If it hadn   t been for Dr. McCullough I wouldn   t be here. I  think he   s still practicing, I   m not sure, but he loves being a doctor.  And playing the piano.  What?  And playing the piano.  22  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Oh yes. Sometimes he goes to the hospital and plays down there for a  while. He   s a very likeable doctor. You can talk to him about anything.  Ask him about his children, though. (Laughs) One of them is a doctor.  Do you have an approach to life, or a motto, you live by?  Just keep moving.  Just keep moving.  Yeah, just keep moving. Don   t sit all the time.  When you think of all the new inventions that have come along, do you  have a favorite?  Yes, well, so many times when I use the microwave, I say    Oh, I wish  my mother had had one,    and she cooked three meals a day. I don   t ever  remember us having sandwiches.  Way back then, they didn   t do that very much like they do now.  What would be a typical meal back then? If you didn   t have sandwiches,  what did you eat?  Well, it was a full meal, wasn   t it?  Oh yeah, chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes and gravy and the  salad and green vegetables and dessert, always dessert. She was a  wonderful baker   a pie baker.  Yeah.  I mean, we got the full treatment at dinner time, in the evening. We  walked home from school at lunch, and she prepared lunch for us. It was  a light lunch, you know, like soup and cornbread, and she usually had a  dessert for lunch, too. I remember walking home from school at noon  time.  Yeah, she cooked a lot of cakes and pies.  And homemade bread?  Yeah, she cooked     Biscuits. She really     23  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Yeah, biscuits.  But I don   t remember her making bread. She may have before my time.  Yeah, cornbread and biscuits.  And that was probably before refrigeration in the home?  Iceboxes.  Iceboxes, yeah.  And my father would fix the refrigerator so that the water went outside.  The melt, it melted. The ice would melt and you   d have water. Most  people had a pan underneath there that you had to empty it every so  often.  Yeah.  But not us.  All he had was the ice.  And then washing machines?  Yes, she had one. I can remember her washing on a washboard, though,  but she probably wasn   t when you were growing up.  No, we had a washing machine.  Yeah.  By then, as I recall.  Yeah, and you   d have three washtubs. You washed in one with soap, and  then you rinsed, and then you put the next one in bluing.  It had to have two rinses.  Yeah, it had to have two rinses, and you did all that by hand. Wringing  and everything. (Laughs) Those were not the days. (Laughter) But we  had a lot of fun.  What were some things you did for fun as a little girl?  24  Bowden  White  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bishop  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  We had games, we had hopscotch outside. I wonder if anyone knows  how to do that anymore.  I think so. And jacks, we played jacks.  Yes, we had a lot of jacks.  Did you family have any rituals or any type of traditions, like for  Christmas or Thanksgiving or birthdays or anything?  Yes, at Christmas everyone gathered at my mother and dad   s house, all  the close ones. Then after they died, they would come over to my house,  and then it got so dangerous because I have quite a few over at Prague,  living at Prague. They   d get ready to go home and there   d be ice every  place, so Fred took us on a vacation. You went, and let   s see, Jonice  went?  Yeah.  Did Olive go on that?  Yes, yes.  Those were your other siblings?  Yes, our two sisters.  He took all of us on a     Caribbean cruise.  Yeah, and     And we flew out of Oklahoma City.  That broke it.  And then our younger sister and number two sister, Jonice and Olive,  flew out of Tulsa and we all met in Dallas. Well, our younger sister was  taking chemo treatments, and she was wearing a wig because she had  lost her hair. I laughingly called Fred    Daddy Warbucks   . Well, when  she showed up down there in Dallas and we went to meet her, she had  on a Little Orphan Annie wig, red curls, because she was going to travel  with Daddy Warbucks. (Laughter) And we had a wonderful tour because  her doctor had arranged her treatments so that she would feel good  25  Bowden  White  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bishop  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  during that time, and then as soon as she returned to Muskogee where  she lived, then she would resume her treatments. It was the last trip that  we all took together.  Oh yeah, and we knew it.  It was just special.  We knew it, but she attended most of the land trips. There was one she  didn   t go on, but the others she did. You could tell, she was just so sick,  but she wanted to go.  So when you traveled, did your husband and all of your siblings go with  you?  She went quite a bit. She was the only one that     Well, sometimes we all went together. There were several trips when we  did that, I know because one time we went to San Antonio, wasn   t it?  We all went together, because our youngest sister worked for a car  dealer and she was able to get a, like an SUV, you know, bigger, where  we could all go together. So we drove down to San Antonio and did the  Riverwalk and the whole smear, and another time, the sisters, we all  went to Colorado, to Denver and Colorado Springs.  You took a sisters    trip?  Yes, Fred was supposed to go, but then something came up where he  couldn   t go, so we all went and had a wonderful time. We were just a  fun-loving group, and we just had a wonderful time together. It was a  big laugh from the time we left until we got back.  We got in to Denver, and we kind of lost track of directions some way.  We said,    Well, if the sun wasn   t out we wouldn   t know north from  south, or east from west.    Do you remember? (Laughs)  Yeah.  I made a right turn, and it was a wrong way. We kept looking at numbers  on businesses or houses, mostly businesses.  It was no big deal, you know, we were taking the scenic tour.  And easy turning rights, we got down there a ways, turned around and  went back the other way and found out where we were going, laughing  all the way.  26  Finchum  White  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  Were practical jokes a part of the picture?  Oh yes, yes.  Well, of the historical events through the years, do any stand out in your  mind? Like, do you remember the John F. Kennedy assassination, that  type of thing?  Yes. I was working some kind of a sale downtown, that the garden club  was having, and I heard the news down there when I was on Main  Street. You kind of remember some things, where you were, you know?  I couldn   t believe it happened. They were having a pretty big sale, too.  There were just so many things that happened, when you stop and think  back.  Do you have a favorite TV show from back in the fifties or sixties?  There was one that our dad liked so much. I know it was two men, but I  can   t remember the name of it.  Was it Amos    n    Andy?  Yes, that   s what it was.  Yes.  He liked that.  Do you remember getting your first television?  Yes, the first one we bought for Mother for Christmas one year. I said,     We don   t even have one and we   re buying one for our  mother , but she  was sick then. She had cancer. Well, let   s see now. We did have one. It  belonged to a friend and he needed a place to leave it for a short time so  we did. We had his television so when he came and got his, then we  bought one. I think it was a lot of comfort for Mother.  It was around Christmas and we put that on the front porch, I remember.  And we ran her upstairs and all around, and she wound up out the front  door and saw that television out there. A lot of things can happen in a  lifetime. Mostly good, but some bad. Two of our sisters have died. We  kept calling one, couldn   t get her, couldn   t get her, sent the police out  there and she was sitting in her chair. She just passed out, she just died.  27  White  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  White  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Reading her bible.  You said, earlier when I met with you, you had a brother that was seven  that passed away?  What?  When Glenn passed away at seven.  Oh, yes.  How did that impact you and your family?  Well, I   m sure it was so much worse for our parents, but I was thirteen at  the time so it really affected me, too.  And I was only one.  I often wonder if they had put him in the hospital, if that would have  helped. He had two problems. He had kidney poisoning and pneumonia,  and at that time what you did for one went against the other one. So they  got rid of his pneumonia, but he could not survive the kidney poisoning.  When this was going on did you have extra family responsibilities you  had to do?  No.  No.  No, Mother took care of him, and my dad helped.  And he was in the home at the time?  Yes.  So you were there, you probably had to help, too, I assume.  Yes, but very little. And let   s see, Gene was five or six months old at  that time, our brother, so mother had that, too, to contend with. He was  breastfed, he just cried and cried. She said,    Well, he   s starving.     That   s kind of a sad experience, but what   s something you would say is  the happiest period of your life?  Well, I guess about the time I married, probably. We took a trip to south  28  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  White  Finchum  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  White  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Bowden  Bishop  Texas and up through New Mexico, went to see an aunt in Colorado.  She had adopted a baby, so we got to see her. Two of Mother   s sisters  adopted. This one a little girl, and the other sister a little boy.  Did you ever have children?  No.  No.  And the sister next to me, she had no children, so I guess my parents  thought it was late (laughter) until she (Wanda) came along with two  boys.  And our youngest sister had four children, and our brother had six.  They made up.  He made up. (Laughter) And they all live around close to him.  Sounds like they may visit you, too.  So they checked on him, in Prague, out of Prague a ways.  It sounds like they take good care of you, too. You said you have one that  mows your grass, a nephew?  That   s our youngest sister   s son and daughter. They   re over here a lot.  Now, when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  I really don   t have anything in mind. Whatever they want to write,  (laughter) more power to them.  In other words, what do you want people to know? What it is you want  them to think?  I hope I was a good aunt to them.  And if you could give a piece of advice to somebody who   s getting ready  to turn 100, what would you tell them?  Be careful. (Laughter) No, I would just tell them to keep moving.  Keep moving, and be careful. (Laughs)  29  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  White  Bowden  White  Bowden  They   re all doing pretty good on their own. I have one that comes to  clean the house, and I have one that mows for me.  And do they ask for a particular food when you cook? Do they have  something favorite of yours?  No.  No specialty dish?  They   re usually here and gone by noon, or if the ones who mow, if they  come, it   ll be in afternoon.  Yeah, but birthdays. For my birthday she always bakes a lemon cake  that is just wonderful.  And it   s just that one layer, plain lemon cake, but that   s the one she  likes.  Well, no matter how I try it, it never turns out the same. I tell her it   s that  extra special loving care that she puts into it. (Laughter)  Well, I tell her what I put in it. She says,    Well that   s what I do too,  that   s what I use.    (Laughs)  Well, how do you plan to celebrate your next birthday, 102? Not  thinking that far ahead?  No, but I hope to get there.  I think you will.  I think I will, yes, I think I will.  I   m working on it.  All the nieces and nephews will gather when she has the party. How  many did you have, thirty?  Something like that. I was getting ready to take off on a vacation so I  just did it the easy way. I made arrangements with Charleston   s   Restaurant  for everybody to come in and just order off the menu and  have whatever they wanted. Then we came back here and had Italian  cream cake and ice cream for her birthday.  And most of them came back over here. I think there was one or two  30  White  Bowden  White  Finchum  Bowden  Finchum  Bowden  from Prague that maybe had something else to do, some of the younger  ones, and went back.  We had a good group.  We had a house full.  Yes we did. She said it was the best birthday party she   d ever had.  (Laughter)  Well, that   s a good note to end on unless there   s something else you  want to add.  Oh, I think we covered everything I can bring to mind right now.  Well, I thank you very much for sharing with us today.  Well, thank you for coming.  -------  -------
