 Finchum  Wooten  Today is August 26, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re  in Del City, Oklahoma, to speak with Lois Wooten. This is regarding  our Oklahoma 100 Year Life project. So thank you for having us  today.  Well, you   re welcome. I   m glad you   re here.  Let   s begin with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Well, I was born in a small town in northeastern Texas and the name  of it is Floyd, was Floyd, Texas. My birth was a hard birth for my  mother, and people thought that I died, that the baby didn   t live. But  she did. So that   s where I spent my life until I got married, which was  about twenty-five, I was about twenty-five years old. But I attended  this school that taught from kindergarten through the eleventh grade,  all in one school. It was a two-story building, brick building. I don   t  know how they managed to do that. But anyway, that   s the way it was.  I went to that same school until I graduated.  Then I wanted to go to a teachers school  East Texas Normal College ,  at Commerce, to college and because Floyd didn   t go through the  twelfth grade my friend and I went to a little town about eight miles  west there, Farmersville, and finished up what credits we needed to go  to college. Then we had to take an entrance exam for that.  But getting back to when I was growing up, in this little town, my  uncle had a restaurant or a caf   or something. Anyway, a man that  wrote a book about this told about the Bo Nolen   s Caf   and it was  noted for the red hot chili. I had never heard that until I got this book,  this is the book that he wrote. He was born in Floyd too, and he lived  5  Finchum  Wooten  to be over 100. He was born in 1910 and was older than me, and his  dad was the banker. I have written down here, we had a bank, and we  had a post office, dry good store, a department store, and we had a  grocery store, and this caf  , and a doctor, and a drugstore. This  railroad track runs right through the middle of the town and we had a  depot. We could ride the train into Greenville  Texas  or Farmersville   Texas . Of course, at that time we didn   t have a car, we had  buggies   horse and buggy.  I had the lady that did the telephone switchboard   we never had a  telephone at home, and we didn   t have running water, and no  electricity, we used lamps. When you had to take a bath, you had a big  old washtub and we didn   t have a door between the kitchen and the  dining room. You   d hang a sheet or something over there, so you   d  have a little privacy. Then you had to heat the water on top of the  stove, until it was right. That   s the way we bathed. The water we had  was from a well just outside the kitchen porch. Of course, not having  electricity, we had an icebox we called it. Of course, kids nowadays  don   t even know what you   re talking about. But you put the ice in the  top and that kept the food cold, but it always had a tray in the bottom.  If you didn   t watch it, it   d run over and spill water all over everything  as it melted. So, that   s the way. Sometimes, I remember, we would put  like, if we   d run out of ice, we   d put like butter and some milk in a  bucket and put it down in the well where it was cold. That   s how we  kept it from souring.  And my mother was a good cook, and she always had a big garden.  They always would have like a half of beef and she would cut that all  up in different things and can it. So we always had plenty to eat, and  as far as money, we didn   t have much of that, but we managed. We  had some land just the back of our house, about ten or eleven acres. It  wasn   t ours, but if you   ve heard of sharecroppers that   s what we did.  We worked on the halves. We did the work and the man that owned it,  whatever we harvested, well, he got half of it. So that   s the way we  made our living and then working in the fields, like for cotton,  chopping the cotton, in the early spring and then picking the cotton  later. My mother told me she used to pick cotton, you had to have a  big long sack with a strap around here, and you pulled it and you  picked the cotton and put it in there. She would take me and I   d ride  on that cotton sack, while she picked cotton.  Were you an only child?  Yes, until I was twelve years old  when my sister, Louise, was born .  That was a joy to all of us.  I was the only grandchild on my mother   s  side until I was eight when my cousin, Jean, was born.  Then I had a  6  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  cousin,  Marie Saint , that her parents passed away (she was my  father   s sister) and so we took her. She was one year older than me,  and she was always real tiny. She was, I guess, a preemie maybe when  she was born because she was always small, but she lived with us and  she was like another sister to us.  So your father was a farmer or a banker?  Well, he did farming, and then in the fall when they had the cotton  ginning we had a   I don   t know whether you know what a cotton gin  is maybe?  A little.  Anyway, he worked at that, and that was a very noisy, dusty place  because I used to go down and watch him sometimes. It was  fascinating because you put the cotton in there with a boll on it and it  was just rolling, rolling until it separated all that. Then you know, the  cotton came out and was put in a bale. If we had cotton you waited  until the price was better before you sold it. Sometimes we   d have two  or three bales. Only, it would be about six-foot tall and I don   t know  how wide. But anyway, we would maybe have two or three of those.  We would play and jump from one to the other. It   s a wonder we  didn   t fall and break our necks. (Laughs) Anyway, that was the way  we had   .  Did they tie it with burlap usually?  Yes. Yeah, and I don   t know whether they still do that or not.  (Laughter)  Would you have to help pick when you got older?  Oh yes, I worked and did everything they did. Sometimes we wouldn   t  even start school until some of the cotton was harvested, you know,  because it was at that time. They   d wait like a week or month or so  before they started school, so the kids could work in the fields. So, I  remember one time we made, I don   t know how we did it, we had a  little more money than usual, and my dad bought a new Ford. It was a  sedan, and black, and we thought we were just about rich when we  had that. You know, all good things come to an end. We couldn   t  make the payments, so they had to come and repossess it. So that was  kind of tough on us, but we made it anyway. Then when I learned to  drive, we did finally get a car, and I learned to drive when I was about  twelve. In Texas, you know, that was before licensing and all that kind  of stuff.  7  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  And in school, I was promoted up instead of promoted back. I was  promoted up because it was boring, the class I was in. It must have  been when I was in about the fourth grade, I guess. Anyway, that  made me younger than the kids that I graduated with. What did I do  with that? This was my graduating class. (Gestures to photograph)  There   s ten of us, five girls and five boys.  What was the name of the school?  Floyd High School or Floyd School.  And what was the name of the elementary, the one through eleventh?  It was the same. That was the same. The only school we had you went  from kindergarten to eleventh in the same building.  And it was just called Floyd?  Yeah. So anyway, Willard Ellis and I tied for valedictorian, and he  came out about one point ahead of me. That knocked me out of the  hat, so I got to be the class poet, but I don   t remember what I wrote.  (Laughs) But I was recognized with something. So that   s what they  called   I was the poet. And I remember when we had our senior play  I had to play the part of an elderly Jewish lady and had to learn to  speak like they did you know. (Laughter)  Something else we did to raise money, help raise money in the school,  we   d have box suppers. You could take a shoebox and decorate it  anyway you wanted to, you know, make it as pretty as you could.  Then you filled that with food, chicken, fried chicken, or whatever  you wanted to fix. Then men would bid. They didn   t know who these  boxes belonged to, but they would bid on them. Then whoever got the  box, you   d share the food with them. That   s the way we did to make  money for the school, to help do some things you know. I played  baseball, and I played basketball, and the basketball uniforms was  black bloomers that had to come below our knees. Had elastic in there,  and so it was quite a show to see us playing basketball like that.  (Laughter)  Then at the end of school, they always had a big picnic or dinner on  the ground, things like that. We had three churches in this little town.  We had a Methodist, and Baptist, and Church of Christ. The Baptists  and the Methodists, they would alternate you know, between the  Sundays, so they wouldn   t all meet on the same day. We were going  to the Methodist church, but later I was saved and became a Baptist,  8  E. Forrester  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  after I married. But anyway, I don   t know whether y   all are Church of  Christ or not, but they always wanted to debate the Bible. That was  their thing, always wanting to debate with the Baptists and the  Methodists because they believed a little differently from us. I  remember that.  Well, did you ever hear of Audie Murphy? He was the most   well, he  was born just a little bit north of where I lived. And he lived   they  moved, they were very poor. There was a big family of them and their  dad went off and left them one time. They moved into Floyd into  somebody   s garage. I remember that real well. He was just a kid, and  him and my sister went to school together. So we had a little  something to be proud of there, from what he turned out to be.  He was the most decorated soldier in World War II.  Of course, he made a movie star and he was killed in a plane wreck.  Then there was another, well, no. You   ve probably never heard of  him, but he was a pitcher for the White Sox and he was from around  there and his name was Monty Stratton. My cousin married his cousin  and he had an accident. He liked to hunt and he was hunting with his  gun and put it down and it went off and shot him in the leg and he lost  a leg. Of course, he couldn   t ever play ball again. But, those are just  some of the things that happened, you know.  And you mentioned that you played baseball   softball? Softball?  No, it wasn   t softball, it was real baseball. Yeah, I got that finger to  show for it. No, it   s this one. (Laughs) I caught it one time, and you  know that was it. You didn   t go to the doctor for everything, but we  did have a doctor there in the town, and I remember we didn   t have  any lawnmowers or anything. We had to cut the grass with hoes, and  this cousin of mine, Marie was her name that lived with us, we were  out cutting the grass. I swung the hoe and hit her on the ankle and split  it, big gash in there. Well, they had to rush her to the   take her to the  doctor. It was his office where they had to take her. It looked like a  piece of the flesh was gone and I was out there looking for it.  (Laughter) It   d just come open you know, but anyway, she didn   t  know, of course, anything about it. They was sewing it up and they  used a needle that was bent, and she told the doctor, she said,    Oh,  you bent the needle, didn   t you?    (Laughter)  How would you get to school?  Well, I practically lived on the school ground. So that was something  else because we didn   t have any kind of cafeteria or anything in the  9  Bishop  Finchum  Wooten  school then, you know. So you had to take your lunch and a lot of the  boys rode horses to school. And I remember one ol    boy that, I didn   t  like him because he would ride like he was going to run over me with  that horse, and I remember one time he was chasing me and I run and  got inside of a fence, you know, a gate in somebody   s yard. I never  did like that guy anymore. (Laughter).  I used to want a horse so bad and they had said (this was probably  when I was probably about eight or nine years old) they said,    If you  see a shooting star and you say something, you   ll get it. Your wish  will come true.    So I used to say,    Horse and saddle, horse and  saddle,    real fast. Well I got the horse, but I never did get the saddle.  (Laughter) My dad traded for a pinto horse and we had a lot of fun  with him, except if you got too many kids, two or three kids get on  him. If one happened to kick him in the flank, he   d buck you off. But I  was always up at the front holding on so I didn   t get bucked off, but  some of the kids did.  What was his name?  The horse   s.  The horse? I don   t remember what we named him, he   s just Pinto I  think, because he was white and brown, and you know, different  colors on him. Then these neighbors, they had a solid white horse that  was a beautiful horse and gentle, and he   d just let us get up and just  slide around on him and ride him. So one time I remember we were  going to have a parade with that horse and we decorated him, and  decorated ourselves, and then just went up and down the road. There  was no streets, it was just road. That was something else.  The town that we traded in was Greenville, Texas, you may have  heard of that. It   s still there and about fifty something miles northeast  of Dallas. They had a sign that was hung, I wanted to show you that  picture. It was hung in the   as you came into the city, the main street,  this sign was hung up above it. It says,    The Blackest Land and the  Whitest People of Greenville, Welcome.    See, when the segregation  came out, they made them take that down because it sounded racist.  That wasn   t what they meant at all. It had nothing to do with race,  because it was a big strip of black land. I mean it was like, if it rained,  it was just like glue. If you got stuck in that, you didn   t get out very  easily and that was what the blackest land was and of course, the  whitest people meant that they were good, and I guess maybe they  could see something wrong with that. Anyway, they made them take it  down. I   ve got a picture somewhere of that. I couldn   t find it though  today, but it showed it in there.  10  L. Forrester  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  And tell them when you first got an indoor bathroom. How long?  Oh, we didn   t have that until I got married.  Running water?  No running water, nothing. For a long time, we didn   t have electricity,  but then we finally got that. That just consisted of a little long wire  hanging down with one bulb in it, you know, but that was better than a  lamp that we had to carry around.  How did that change life, electricity and water?  That helped a lot then, because we could get an electric iron. You  know, we used to heat our iron to iron things; we heated on the stove.  We had to have like two irons. You   d keep one on the stove and then  you   d iron and then you   d change. The other one would be hot, you  know. Of course, not having any electricity in the winter, we had a  little old stove. It wasn   t much bigger than this, and it had two round  things like burners that you could take the cap off and put a pot on  there and cook beans or something. That was how we   d heated our  front room that we had. That was also our bedroom, you know. We  didn   t have a separate one. At night, when it was cold, it would really  be cold in the other rooms and my mother used to heat a brick, you  know, and wrap it up and put it in the bed with us to keep us from  freezing, but we had lots of cover, too, you know. So     Did she quilt, your mother?  Oh, quilt. Don   t talk about that. (Laughs) We kept a quilt going all the  time, just about. What it was, it was hung from the ceiling. You  could   had these wooden things that you   d put it on, fasten it down,  and then you had to sit and sew, and I had more pricked fingers from  that sewing. I never did like to quilt, but yes, we did do a lot of  quilting.  My mother was a very good seamstress, and I never felt like I didn   t  have things the other kids had because she was such a good  seamstress. I always had good clothes. She was very talented in other  things too, you know. She did a lot of other things. She was kind of a  progressive person too, because she was the first woman in Floyd to  get her hair cut. That   boy that was   if she hadn   t have been married,  that would   ve been terrible. (Laughter) You know, if she hadn   t been  married, that would   ve been terrible. But my sister has that, still has  her hair. My niece, her daughter has it. We kept her hair and it was  11  E. Forrester  Wooten  long, quite a bit of hair that they cut. Then, of course, after she got  hers cut, everybody else starting getting theirs cut, but she started it.  I remember she used to make me, for Christmas, she   d make little     one time she made me like a little dresser and put a mirror on it for my  dolls you know. Then we had a big old, kind of like a cedar chest, and  one day I was fooling around in there to see what was in it and I found  a doll that she had put away for Christmas and I got it ahead of time. I  wasn   t supposed to be looking for that. Then she would make, I don   t  know what they   d call this, you   d soak newspapers in water and it  made it like a mush or something. Then you could shape that around a  glass or pitcher and after it dried then you could paint it. It   d didn   t  look like what you thought it was, you know, but it was beautiful work  that they could do that with. I don   t know what they called it     Paper-m  ch  .     but she was good at that too. She was a good cook and everybody  wanted to come to Aunt Nora   s, her name was Nora. Her picture   s  right up there, a picture of her that she sent to friends and relatives in  Alabama. One of them saved that postcard and gave it to me when we  had a reunion recently.  Well anyway, I went ahead   I didn   t get to go to college very long  because of the times. It was in 1931 was when I graduated, and so that  was bad times and didn   t have the money to go because my mother,  when I graduated, she didn   t even have the money to buy my  graduation ring. She borrowed it from her sister. I think it cost eight  dollars. Now I think they cost hundreds. I still have it.  So then, after I didn   t go to college, I went to Dallas, to a beauty  school over there. I was going to take a beauty course and get to be a  beautician. Well, I stayed with a lady that was a schoolteacher,  because I could do a little housework and cooking for my board.  Didn   t have to do that, you know, but I always had to ride a streetcar  going there. It was   you   d have to change from one to the other  because the one didn   t go directly there.  We had some friends that had lived in Floyd and had moved to Dallas,  but I had lost track of them a long time. One day as I was, one  morning, I was going to the school, this young man got on, about my  age, and he cleared his throat like kind of coughed. I thought,    That  sounds like this friend of mine.    He went back to sit down, and I went  back and I said,    Are you Klein Harris?    And it was. So I got to visit  with him while I was in Dallas, and I also got to meet my cousins, my  youngest uncle, Charlie Nolen. He and his wife separated, and she  12  Finchum  Wooten  moved to Dallas and she had two girls near my age. So I had lost track  of them and then when I went to that school over there I looked them  up. I have pictures of them now that I didn   t, you know, never had  before.  But another story, I got so homesick. When they   d come over I   d cry  all the time they was there. So I finally quit and didn   t finish that. So  then after that, well, there wasn   t much to do in Floyd so   but I guess  you   ve heard of the Hagar Manufacturing, pants factory. They put in a  factory in Greenville. Well, of course all the young ladies and  everybody went to put their application in. My cousin, Marie, she was  working, keeping house for some people. She had a telephone. We  never had a telephone either, that was something else. She called and  said that they had   we gave her phone number and so when we went I  took   I was the only one that had a car that I could take them in. So I  took all the others that had applied, and when I got there they didn   t  have my name on there. They had got the others, but they didn   t get  mine. But anyway, I didn   t like that and so I told them so and  explained things to them and then they let me work too. That   s where  I met the love of my life, her dad.  So you didn   t like making quilts, but you didn   t mind sewing pants?  No. I did the buttonholes and my husband was about as far as from me  to her and he was pressing the top of the pants with a presser. Of  course we eyed one another up. (Laughs) I would always smile at him.  I guess you call that flirting, I don   t know. (Laughter) But anyway, for  a break we   d go outside at this filling station at   Mr. Cheat was the  name of the guy that owned it. We   d get candy you know, and stand  around and talk, and stuff like that. He   d buy me a drink and first  thing you know, we   re dating. So then we got married August the  19th, 1939 and we lived on Church Street in an apartment in a home.  This widow, her husband was a Baptist preacher and he had passed  away and she was renting out half of her house which was a living  room, bedroom, and kitchen, and bath, you know. So we got that and  it was ten dollars a month, but we didn   t have a car because the car  that we had, I had bought that so I left it with my parents. They needed  a car. So we had to walk to work for a long time there.  Then we found an apartment over closer to work for eight dollars and  they   re the same people. I mean, it was Mrs. Wright and then Mr.  Wright, but they weren   t related, but that   s where we lived. So that   s  when we bought us   we were going to buy a car. Well, we didn   t  have the money for the down payment, so the guy let us leave it on  there, on the lot, until we got enough money for the down payment. I  remember that my uncle died, my dad   s older brother, Uncle Dan, and  13  L. Forrester  Wooten  they let us have that car to go to the funeral, but we had to take it back  and put it on the lot until we got enough money for the payment. We  even kept that, that   s what we came to Oklahoma in, but then we  finally traded it off.  Tell them about the twins.  Yeah, we had been trying to have a child and wasn   t   well it wasn   t  working. So we went to this doctor. Phillips was his name. He gave  me some fertility pills or whatever, and so I got pregnant with twins,  twin boys, but before they were born I was having troubles. So they  put me to bed and my mother came to see us   help me. I looked up at  a picture one day and I said I could see like double. So she called the  doctor, and he said to get me in quickly because that wasn   t a good  sign. But anyway, they went full term and then when they were  born   but they were stillborn. That was a tragedy to us. She  Linda   came along about three years later and what a blessing she   s been.  Then when she was two months old   oh, I forgot to tell this. This was  when I was pregnant with her. My grandmother passed away and my  grandfather was having trouble just living by himself. He just lived  right across the road from my mother. So she suggested that we come  out live with him and you know, cook for him and all. So we did. I  remember one day Ernest came in about the middle of the afternoon  and I said,    Well, what   re you here doing?    He said,    Well, I quit my  job.    And I thought,    Oh my goodness, it   s a terrible time to quit your  job.    He said,    But I got a better one.    It was in the war, during the  war you know, in    41. They had put an air training field in Greenville  where they trained the pilots. So he got a job as a firefighter. His  sister, Ethel, she   s the one who told him about putting his application  in, and so he did.  So then we moved back to Greenville with a couple of old people  named   what was their name? Anyway, it was on Jones Street. That   s  where it was when she was born and it wasn   t in a hospital. It was an  old house that had been made into a hospital. And it was funny  because they didn   t have any kind of gurneys or anything, you know.  So they had to call the funeral home to come and move you from  the   where you   she was born to a room. Only it was a big old room  and people were just lying around it you know. It wasn   t like a  hospital room. But anyway, this guy that came to move me, I had gone  to school with him and his name was Coker, and I said,    Jim, I   ve got  the prettiest little brown-eyed baby girl.    I don   t know how I knew she  had brown eyes. You know when babies are little they say you can   t  much tell. But anyway, she was such a blessing, has been such a  blessing to us all. But anyway, then when she was two months old, we  14  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  were transferred to Fort Worth. It was Fort Worth Army Air Force,  Air Field. We stayed there until she was two. She wrote a letter to her  daddy, I wrote it and let her     Well, he came up here.  Yeah, they were going to close down the field at Fort Worth, so they  could transfer up here to this air field. At that time if you had  seniority, you could go to another place and if someone didn   t have  that much, they   d bump them out, they called it. Well, that   s what  happened up here at Tinker Field. So when these guys from Fort  Worth came, oh they didn   t like that at all. They was just really mean  to them. In fact, he just almost quit, you know, but he hung in there  and before he retired he had some of his best friends there.  But anyway, he was staying at a boarding house with an old lady,  several of the firefighters were, so I wrote him. I printed a letter off  you know, like I wanted her to do. She copied it, when she was about  two. She copied that and I said,    Well, I   ve got proof,    because I still  have it. You know, because she said in there,    I miss you, Daddy    and  stuff like that. Anyway, then when we moved up here we had to stay  at Odom   s Court, out on Highway 77. It   s all gone now. But it was a  motel.  An old motel.  Yeah, motel. They still have   I noticed the other day Odom the third  was in some kind of real estate. But anyway, we stayed there and we  had a little hot plate that I would cook on when he   d come home. They  got off early of the morning and he   d come home for breakfast. That  was changing, when they were changing, and this other couple was  living in one of the rooms too. But they were teasing me, because I  would cook my bacon and eggs, you know, and they said,    They can  smell that when you   re cooking.    (Laughter) I wasn   t supposed to be  doing that, you know.  But anyway, we stayed there for a while and thought we never would  find a place, but one of the firefighters lived in a duplex and one of  them was vacant, and I practically begged him, you know, to rent it to  us and so he did. So we lived there. That was over in Capitol Hill. We  lived there until she was five and then we moved to Del City and  bought a house. It was on a corner lot that was shaped like this, a big  lot and didn   t have any   course, grass or anything, you know, on it.  We had a telephone booth in the corner of the yard, because they  didn   t have any telephones out here.  15  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Finchum  It was hilarious.  But anyway, we lived there and we put in a fence, and my husband  liked to work in the yard, and so he planted red roses. That was just a  kind of a showcase you know, because it was up kind of like on a little  hill and he had all these pretty roses around there. Then he had a heart  attack in 1965, and so he had to kind of slow down and couldn   t do  much work in the yard. So that   s when we moved here, moved over  here, and that   s the year that she got married. She went to OBU   Oklahoma Baptist University  and my husband had said,    Well, when  she gets married, I   m having a talk with her husband.    Well, when she  met him, he was good-looking, tall, handsome, short hair; my husband  didn   t go for this long hair at all.  He didn   t want any facial hair either. No mustache.     no mustache, anything like that. But anyway, it was funny because  they had a blind date. A friend of hers had got her a blind date with  Eldon. We were up in her room getting stuff put in there and we  looked out the window and they were walking across and he says,     Now that   s the kind of guy I want her to marry.    So, and that was  something else I forgot. He told me after we married that before we  married, he said,    If I marry, get married, that   s going to be her.    So  he thought he was sure of himself. (Laughter) Anyway, then came our  grandkids and I was working at the school. I guess I better go back.  We spent a lot of time going back and forth to Texas. Well we had this  car, it was a Chevrolet. It kept getting out of gear as you drove along.  So coming back we stopped at Denison, Texas just to look at some  new cars and wound up just trading in that car and getting us a brand  new Ford. Except it didn   t have an air-conditioner or heater. I got a  job at Woolworth in Capitol Hill, and it was so cold that winter. So  my husband sold his shotgun, which he loved, to put a heater in there  for me. So anyway, and then that   s when we moved out here and I  started working at TG Y. That   s where Gregory   s is now in Del City.  The first thing I was doing, they put me to making Easter baskets, you  know, decorating and fixing them up. So I worked there a while and  then a friend of mine, they opened up the high school, and she was  going to be the cafeteria manager so she hired me to help her. We  worked one year together and she got pregnant and had to quit. So  then I had to be the manager and I was there until they built a junior  high school, Kerr Junior High, and so I went there as cafeteria  manager. Worked there for twenty-five years, and that   s where I  retired from.  The food changed a lot in that time period, didn   t it?  16  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Oh yes, we did everything from scratch. We made the most delicious  food. Still, the kids, it was cafeteria food they thought, but if they  knew what they were having now, they would be glad. Wished they   d  had what they did. We   d make cinnamon rolls from scratch, and we  had pans about this long and about this wide, and I had the best cook.  She would make pie crusts, fitted in those old big pans, and we would  make cream pies like coconut pies, pumpkin pie, and stuff like that.  The cinnamon rolls were our specialty, too, you know. Then we   d  have for Thanksgiving and all, we would make turkey. The  government would furnish the turkeys and stuff, and we had a pot that  was about yea big and about that tall. I would make the dressing in  that, cornbread dressing. Had a big paddle that looked like what you   d  row a boat with, that   s what you stirred it with. (Laughter) But it was  good, wasn   t it?  Yes, it was good. They sold extra cinnamon rolls. Kids would line up  to buy those things.  Yeah, and she was in the band. She played in the band and that   s  another story.  Back to the cafeteria, could you all decide what you were going to  serve that day or was it planned?  We had a manager, a lady that helped us with our   well at first, we  didn   t have that. We just had to do it on our own and figure out what  we were going to have. Then they hired a supervisor and she made out  the menus and you know, and helped us a lot with that. We fed, at one  time, about 1,000 kids a day. Then of course it whittled down later. It  was a lot of hard work, but it was rewarding you know, too.  Make homemade rolls?  Yeah, oh yeah, homemade rolls. We had big old mixers and I  remember one year at the end of school that my principal, he was so  good   that   s the reason I went to Kerr with him instead of staying at  the high school, because he was real good to me and his wife was a  teacher. She taught the home ec, we called it. They were both real nice  people, good to us. He treated me like a teacher instead of a cook you  know. Anyway, one year at the end of school   of course, everybody   s  wanting to get out you know, so we were just going to have  sandwiches. Well we ran out of sandwiches, and here he comes. He  went off and bought these little cans, tuna cans, tuna fish. I don   t  know how many he had, but he knew I didn   t like that because how in  the world was you going to mix that in that big old mixer? But  17  Finchum  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  anyway, I had to do it. Later he came in and he said,    Should I have  thrown my hat in first?    (Laughs) So he was very, very, good to work  for.  And so when did you retire from that?  I retired in 1976. That   s when I got to have my dream come true. I  started taking art lessons for six years, oil paintings. That was one of  my things on my bucket list was to be an artist, because I used to love  to draw and do things like that. Then after that my mother got to  where she couldn   t live by herself, and my husband retired. Then he  went to work for Capitol Abstract Company and worked down there  for about eighteen years being a messenger, just delivering things, and  loved that kind of work. Of course, after his heart attack that was  good, the walking, he needed that. After she passed away, we had  some friends that worked for a tour bus company and so we started  traveling. We got to go to the places we   d never dreamed that we   d  ever get to go to like Niagara Falls, and Washington, and California,  just you know all over the place.  Hawaii. Hawaii.  Hawaii     So moving to Oklahoma wasn   t a bad thing.  No, it turned out it was really good. I said,    If I look back, I could just  see how the Lord led us all the way.    You know, things just fell into  place.  You got to tell the one funny story about Hawaii, and the money, and  where you had it.  Oh. (Laughs) Well, my mother used to be our banker at home. She  carried a little thing she sewed up and she carried her money down  here. (Gestures to chest) So when we went to Hawaii we had to take a  lot of cash. So I would, you know, just put it wherever I could.  (Laughs) Well, we went to the beach, and not used to being in the  water or around anything like that, those waves when they come in  they   ll just knock you down if you don   t watch out. Well, that   s what  happened and it came and just went all over me. So when I went back  at the hotel, that   s the reason she wanted me to tell this, I had fifty  dollar bills scattered all over trying to dry them out. (Laughter)  She had some stuffed here and there, they all got wet. (Laughter)  18  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  But anyway, we had a wonderful life.  And now your grandchildren.  Oh yes, my grandchildren. That   s in 1937, I mean    67, and she had a  baby girl, Shelley Ren  . After they married they lived in Enid for a  while. He had a job with the oil company and they moved to Texas,  Levelland, Texas, only where he worked was called Sundown, Texas  which was not much to it. They lived in Levelland, so we kept the  road hot going back and forth to Levelland. Especially after the baby  was born and then three years later she had Jennifer, another little girl.  So of course we was proud of them. Sometimes you do things and  then you forget about it you know. I know when the youngest one, she  wanted to be a physical therapist, and I paid her tuition to do that. I  just kind of forgot about it and now she has a real good job, it   s with  hospice. She told me one time that if I hadn   t done   she reminded me  that I helped her do that. Then she said how many   she didn   t know  how many car tags that I had paid for. (Laughs)  Used to do that for both the girls.  Yeah, every time they   d get a car we   d buy the tag for them, and  sometimes it was pretty expensive, you know, back then compared to  what it is now. It was out of reach. Anyway, I   m still enjoying them.  They both have good jobs, they   re smart and they got beautiful homes  and     Now you   ve got great-grandsons.  Oh yeah, that   s the love of my life.  You said you were the class poet. Did you ever memorize any poetry?  Yes,    When Grandma Cleans the Attic Room.    I was about five years  old, I guess. My uncle came back from the first world war, World War  I, and my mother had taught me this. It was never written down until  several years ago that I decided I better write it down because you  know, nobody would ever know it. I don   t know where she got it, but I  memorized it and I still know it. I may try to say it for you, but  probably now I can   t do it.  Well, let   s try.  Am I too long?  No, no. You   re doing good.  19  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Well, this is about a little girl and she   s helping her grandma. It   s  called,    When Grandma Cleans the Attic Room.     About the first of spring  She opens up every box and shakes out everything.  She sweeps the rafters and the floor and makes the windows shine,  And Grandma says I help because I hold the dustpan fine.  And then she opens up her keepsake box so I can peep inside,  Inside   s the bonnet that she wore when she was a happy bride.  Grandpa   s vests, and fans, and things, and letters tied in blue,  And the very first gown she made for my Aunt Lou.  And then there   s this little pair of red top boots, just hardly worn at all,  Just scuffed a little around the toe and awfully cute and small.  And then she sets in that old squeaky chair, the one she loves the best,  Because it   s the one she rocked all her babies in to rest.  And then when she holds these little boots and kisses them, then I  know. That   s the little boy that died almost forty years ago.  All of her other children have all grown up, and caused her no regret,  But oh that little boy that died, he   s her baby yet.  Oh my goodness.  She said my uncle just cried when I recited that to him.  That   s quite good, if you were just five too, to remember all of that.  I know, and it was never written down. That   s something else.  And you still remember it.  I know it. It   s just like it   s burned into my brain. You know, because a  lot of other things I don   t remember. (Laughs) I may not remember  what yesterday was.  So one uncle went to World War I?  Oh I had   let   s see, I had Uncle Dick, Uncle Gus, my Uncle Ang, and  my   I had about four uncles that were in that war. My Uncle Gus was  the older one and he was wounded. I think he got the Purple Heart.  His son, which is my cousin, we still correspond. They live in Texas.  That   s something else, when I was working and got the job at the  pants factory, he was about nine years old or less. I was talking about  that they just had fans around. It was kind of hot in there you know,  and I was talking about it. He spoke up, he says,    But it   s in the shade,  ain   t it?    (Laughter) So that   s been one of our sayings, you know, if  20  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  something   s not going  right ,    Well it   s in the shade, ain   t it?   ,  because he had to work in the field where it was hot.  You got to tell them your great-grandsons    names and everything.  Oh yeah, her grandsons, my great-grandsons   where   s my purse? I   ve  got a little picture here of them. Now, they   re like that, I have to look  up to them. Calvin and Josh, Calvin is the older one with the glasses,  and Josh, and Josh has entered OU and he really loves it. The other  one, he   s gone to some at Rose State hadn   t he?  OSU Tech here at NOC.  Yes, and OSU Tech, but he   s working for UPS.  UPS, nighttime supervisor.  They   re not married, they don   t even have girlfriends. Well I think  Josh is kind of shy you know, and hasn   t met many girls, but when he  was little, he was so cute. The girls, little girls you know, kind of  noticed him. One day I said to him,    Well, does Calvin have a  girlfriend?    And he said,    No. He can   t get one.    (Laughter)  There   s five year difference between them. Before you get done, we  want you to tell that other poem about the pig.  About the what?  The pig. You know that you     Okay. Well, this little story I used to tell my granddaughters. They   d  come and then I   d tell it and then they   d want me to tell it again. It   s  this little old lady   now you know it was a long time ago, because it  said that the story was that this old lady found a dime. So she thought,     What can I do with it? I   m going to town to buy me a pig.    So she  went into town and she got a pig. She started home and she came to a  fence, and she couldn   t get the pig to jump over the fence. So, she  found a stick, and she said,    Stick, stick, beat pig. Pig won   t jump  over the fence and I can   t get home tonight.    But the stick wouldn   t do  it, so she found some water   I mean some fire, and she said,    Fire,  fire, burn stick, stick won   t beat dog, dog won   t bite pig, pig won   t  jump over the fence and        You left out the dog.  21  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Oh I did? Anyway, dog wouldn   t bite pig; pig wouldn   t jump over the  fence. So, that was   what was that? The fire   oh the water. She  wanted the water to put out the fire, but the water wouldn   t do it.  Water wouldn   t do it. The fire wouldn   t put out the      The water  wouldn   t put out the fire, fire wouldn   t burn the stick, stick won   t beat  dog, dog won   t bite pig, and I won   t get home tonight.    So then she  saw a butcher and she said   I mean an ox. She said,    Ox, ox, drink  water, water won   t put out fire,  fire won   t burn  stick, stick won   t  beat dog, dog won   t bite pig, pig won   t jump over the fence and I  can   t get home tonight.    But he wouldn   t do it. And she got a rope and  she said,    Rope, rope, hang butcher, butcher won   t kill ox, ox won   t  drink water, water won   t put out fire, fire won   t burn stick, stick won   t  beat dog, dog won   t bite pig, and I won   t get home tonight.    But the  rope wouldn   t do it, but then she got a little mouse and she asked him.  He said,    You get me some cheese and I will.    So he began to chew  the rope, the rope begin to hang the butcher, the butcher began to kill  the ox, ox began to drink the water, the water began to put out the fire,  the fire began to burn the stick, the stick began to beat the dog, and the  pig jumped over the fence and she got home that night. (Laughter)  The kids loved it. (Laughs)  Did you ever hear anything like that?  I haven   t heard anything like that ever.  I don   t think so. (Laughter) Well, that was something I learned years  ago and I still haven   t forgot it.  Did you use that as a nighttime story for the grandkids?  Oh yeah, yeah, that and making them milkshakes. You know, they   re  both thin, they   re not fat, but if they put on a pound they blame  Grandma with it because I made them milkshakes when they came to  see me.  Well how do you keep up with these grandchildren and great-grandchildren  today? Do you talk to them or converse with them?  We get together. We don   t get together too much now that they   re     you know, the way their working and school and stuff. Now, his  birthday   s coming up. We   ll probably all get together at some  restaurant or something, because the older granddaughter and them,  they   ve just bought a new home and they   re packing up. They   ve sold  the other one and they   re getting ready to  move .  22  L. Forrester  Bishop  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  L. Forrester  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  He   s talking about how you communicate with them     Yeah, how you communicate.     is what he   s getting at.  Oh well, no I don   t get to do this with them because you know, I do  with my daughter     Yeah, but you text everybody. He wants to know about that.  Oh, is that what     I was wondering if the grandkids, or great-grandkids, if they   re  texting you and you   re texting back.  Oh well, I don   t get to do them, but I do my other family because  they   re at work and I really don   t know their phone number right now.  I don   t have that. Oh, I text my niece and I text her  Linda  and  anybody that   s got   where I can. (Laughs) I love to text because     What about the group email?  How did you learn how to do that?  Texting?  Yes.  Well nothing to it. (Laughter) You just... I don   t see anything and I do  shorthand on there. I say, L-U-V U, you know. I don   t spell it all out  because     Tell her how many email friends you   ve had before. We talked about  that with Alex, but I mean you got so many people.  Oh well, you know, they   ve kind of dropped off some because one  guy that used to send me about half a dozen a day, whoever was  sending him, quit sending to him, you know. So I don   t have as many  now as I used to, but...  How long have you had your computer?  Well, I got the first one when I was ninety and I wore it out, or  whatever. So I got me a new one, and then my niece   where   s my  iPad?  23  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Finchum  It   s in front of you.  Here it is. She insisted that I get an iPad so I did, and I   oh, I love to  play games. This way I can sit and play games and I can also, you  know, check on that and do a lot of things with that.  You also read your bible on there, don   t you?  Oh yeah, I like to   I love that because it   s so easy to find right quick  you know. I keep my bible here, but I usually read it out of this.  And who taught you how to use those things?  Oh well, my niece   s daughter. She   s a whiz on this stuff and if you got  something wrong   she   s about got me ready to where I can fix it  though. If something goes wrong in there, I just keep messing with it  some way and first thing you know it   s okay. So I don   t know how     sometimes I don   t know how I do it, but it works. If I get really  stumped she   ll come over and help me. My oldest granddaughter, she  has helped me too. She   s good at that.  What has been the greatest invention, you think, that you   ve seen in  your lifetime?  Oh, I think stuff like this. My goodness you can get on that computer  and find anything. In fact, we   ve got a whole bunch of encyclopedia  books in there that we used to use to look up stuff. Now, with just one  little poke on there and you   ve got it. I was going to show you what  this new stuff was that I was learning, going to learn I hope.  What do you do today for hobby and     Well, work cryptoquotes. Do you know what a cryptoquote is?  No, I   ve heard of them, but I   ve never seen them.  Well, this is a cryptoquote. I run these off on the computer because I  don   t get but one in the paper and that   s too easy. I got to have  something a little more   this is what I   ve ordered, it   s called  Zentangle and it   s a form of art. I got on the internet with that and it   s  amazing what you can do with that. Anyways, it   s so new and  different so I   m just anxious to see what it   s all about. Do something  different.  And do you still paint?  24  Wooten  E. Forrester  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Bishop  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Yes, I paint cards every once in a while. Linda, would you go get  some of them in there and bring them in here?  Our youngest daughter works for     Hospice. Well, she wanted me to make some cards for them to use.  Like birthday cards and things that she could use in this job she has,  and so I made a bunch of them. She put on the back a little sticker that  she put on there, and she said,    This is made by my 100-year-old  grandmother and I hope you enjoy it as much as she enjoyed doing it.     I thought that was very sweet of her to put that on the back of those  cards.  How long would it take you to do that?  Well, probably an hour or two. That   s done with water colors. Some  of these now, I   m just running them off the cards and making copies. I  said,    After all there was only one Mona Lisa.    (Laughter)  You   re steady enough to do it.  What   s a typical day like for you today at 100? What time do you  usually get up out of bed and what do you   how do you start your  day?  Well, if it   s something I have to get up for, I get up pretty early.  Otherwise I may be asleep at twelve o   clock at noon because I don   t  get to bed before eleven. I don   t know, I get in here and watch the  news. I like to watch Forty-four Station because they tell you  everything that   s going on and what   s wrong with it. But when I get  up earlier like I have something to do, well, the main thing is I do my  breakfast and then I read the paper and work the cryptoquote. Then I  work on cards or play games or just whatever I need to do   keep my  kitchen clean and do my laundry and you know, just take care of  things. Well I don   t do the sweeping, but my niece   we have a little  arrangement with her and she comes over every so often and runs the  sweeper and dusting and doing other things that I can   t do, you know.  We didn   t ask, but one thing we ask the folks is how important was  church or religion growing up and then into today?  Well, I grew up in a Methodist church and back then they didn   t seem  to push like the Baptist. Well I went to the Baptist and Methodist you  know, really all my life, just first one and then the other.  25  Bishop  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Finchum  But today, you told us that earlier, do you still go to church every  Sunday?  Well no, because getting me out of the house, I have to use a little  hand walker to get down my steps you know, to get out into the  garage. Then I go through there and they take   I have a little transport  chair that just folds up that they can fold up and put in the car. So I go  in that, but I didn   t go to their church, so I just can   t ask somebody to  do all that for me every Sunday. Besides, I just can   t get up that early  and get around and do it.  Well yeah, we would be happy to take her, but it   s just hard on her to  do that every week.  Every week it is, because I always dread when I have to get up and go  early. (Laughter)  And then to sit there too, in an uncomfortable place.  But I still read my bible, and I still keep up with my church, and I still  contribute to it, and also get the bulletin. They send it from the church  with the sick list and what   s going on. So I keep up with everybody  and that   s why I   ve got so many birthdays coming up in September,  about fourteen of them. A lot of them, you know, they put out the list  of who has a birthday too from our church. So a lot of these people I  have sent cards to before you know, most of them I have.  Do you do them from memory?  I have to have a picture to look at. I usually send that to some guy  that   s raised on the farm. (Card with rooster) Then I   ve got one with a  barn on there that I send it to him.  So do you have a motto in life that you live by?  Well, I don   t know, except that my mother was very creative and you  know, I always looked up to her with things you could do. And  because she didn   t have any formal education, but she wrote a  beautiful hand and I have a lot of her   she started our genealogy. She  was a Graham and she started the Graham genealogy and doing it all  by hand   writing. She had beautiful handwriting. She would never  misspell a word because she kept the dictionary there if she needed to  spell a word, and I find that that   s pretty helpful for me sometimes. I  can   t always spell everything too.  Well did you ever expect to live to 100?  26  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  E. Forrester  L. Forrester  No, no I didn   t. I never   well, I really never thought about it. I  thought,    Well, I guess I   ll just live as long as the Lord can use me,     you know. I   m most happy when I   m doing something for somebody  else, I really am.  That   s the motto, right there. That   s it.  If it   s not one thing, it   s another. Isn   t it? If I don   t do one thing I   ll  say,    Here, take my credit card and go get you some gas,    or  whatever. (Laughs) I had a doctor that did some surgery on my throat.  I was having some problems and he said,    Now you   re going to have  to take calcium,    and I said,    Oh, those old pills are too big.    You  know, calcium tablets, if you   ve ever seen one, they   re about that long  and I couldn   t swallow it. I said,    Could milk do it?    And he said,     Well, yeah.    And I said,    Chocolate milk?    He laughed and he said,     Well, I have no restriction on what you can eat or drink.    So I eat and  drink what I want to, except I don   t drink anything but chocolate milk.  Well that kind of leads   what do you think your secret is to a long  life? Why have you lived so long? What   s your secret?  Well, sometimes I wonder. I don   t know, I guess it   s my positive  attitude and I have such a sense of humor. I can find a lot of things     you get us together, a lot of us, and it   s just laughter, you know. You  know the Bible will tell you,    A merry heart doeth good, but a bad  spirit drieth up the bones.    That   s in  Proverbs .  She   s a great example of what a Christian life is supposed to be about.  She lives the word of God is what she does.  Well, I used to teach Sunday school all the time. Usually kids, you  know, in junior high and all. That got to be a pretty chore you know. I  don   t know how it is now, but usually that   s a hard class to reach. You  know in junior high, they think they know it all.  It   s true. (Laughter)  You got some like that?  She   s always looking forward and looking for opportunities to do  whatever.  I   ve never seen her just dwelling on herself. She doesn   t do that. You  ask about being depressed. She   s not depressed because she never  focuses on her.  27  Bishop  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Well, if history were written today, what would you want it to say  about you?  Well, I don   t know. Like I said, I like to do things for people, and I  like for things   for people to be good and we wouldn   t have all these  terrible things that   s going on. If I could rewrite history, if everybody  could get along and things like that. That   s something   like in our  family, we never have any problem because we all love each other and  we put them first rather than what we feel. I just hardly ever feel down  because I can just always pick up a puzzle and get on it and that takes  my mind off of things, you know.  Well, do you have anything left on your bucket list you want to do?  It   s not jump out of an airplane, I   ll tell you for sure. (Laughter)  That   s on mine, so let   s go.  No, I don   t think I want to do that.  I don   t want to jump out of a plane.  No, I don   t want to do that for sure because I think heights   I have  been in one of those big tall restaurants up in   we went over into  Canada. That   s something else. I mean, we went to Niagara Falls and  we rode the Maid of the Mist in those boats out there. Did you ever do  that?  No, that   s on my bucket list though.  Well   and I was surprised at my husband that he went. They put these  old coats on us. Luckily they were made out of rubber or something  because you get wet   and caps on, but it was fun. You get up under  there and you can see all that. But I can   t imagine someone going over  that in a barrel, and I think some people have survived and a lot of  them haven   t, but it   s amazing. We went to that restaurant over in  Canada, that way when you   re up there you can really see it. They said  an Indian discovered that and we wondered how   what he thought  when he discovered it. Did he go over it or what did he do? (Laughter)  Well, do you have any memories from the influenza back in 1919? Did  that impact your family any?  No, I don   t remember it affecting us, you know, in any way.  28  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  And then you said the Depression was tough, but you lived through it.  Yeah, it was. We didn   t really know because we always had plenty to  eat and to wear and it wasn   t a lot. We had to work hard for it, but a  lot of my friends they had farms. They owned the farms, which made  them have more than we did, but I never did feel like I didn   t have  that, because my parents always took good care of us.  And then you were out of Texas by the time the Dust Bowl was  occurring I guess?  Yeah, we didn   t get any of that. That was mostly Oklahoma. Wasn   t it  Grapes of Wrath that was written? You know.  Was music ever a part of your life?  Well, I always wanted to play the piano. I guess if I had a bucket list  that would be it. When she took me to see   I did take some, but it was  hard then, but I could play one song and that was Juanita. You know,     Nita, Juanita,    I could play that and I would play that everywhere I  went that had a piano. I think I kind of gave up on it, didn   t I?  Yeah, you did.  It was just a little too much.  I   ve still got the piano.  Yes, she still has the piano. I don   t know whether she can play it or  not now.  I can play it some. I took piano for about eight years I guess.  Yeah.  What would you and your husband do for fun   leisure?  Well we did a lot of traveling, of course, then. Oh, we liked to go to  OU football games, we did. That was one of the highlights; we loved  to do that.  Play card games? Did you play cards?  No, I don   t think we ever did. He was a deacon in the church and he  had a lot of responsibility with that. He liked to be out working in the  yard when we had that big, big yard. She said she remembered when  29  L. Forrester  Wooten  Bishop  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  I   d have supper ready and I couldn   t get him to come in and eat.  (Laughter)  He liked to hunt and fish.  Oh yeah, he and his brother   and by the way, I didn   t tell you this, but  we married brothers, my sister and I. I married the older one, and she  married the youngest. She was just out of high school when she  married him, but after we married and they would be at our home at  the same time and they   d get in the kitchen like cooking stuff. My  husband said,    You just wait, he   ll be wanting to date her and next  thing you know they   ll be married.    And I said,    Oh, you   re crazy.     And sure enough that   s what happened.  They married during the war and he was stationed in Mississippi. I  had to go with her on the bus. We rode the bus down there for her to  get married. At the time, they had a restriction on the servicemen  using taxies because of the prostitution that was going on, you know.  So we walked, had to walk, and I wore a blister on my heel. I don   t  know why they never thought that we could ride in a taxi. (Laughs)  He couldn   t, but we could. But anyway, we never thought of that I  guess, because   but anyway, I always remember that because that   s  painful, you know.  So you had a pretty good relationship with the in-laws then?  Yes, oh we sure did because we didn   t have to break anybody else in.  (Laughter) We   d already broken them all, by him being the youngest  and mine being the oldest.  Tell a little bit about our summer vacations with them.  Oh yeah, we used to go to Colorado a lot. They loved Colorado. The  boys would go fishing, trout fishing, and whatever. I guess that was  one of our main things, was going fishing. I remember one trip we  made up there, and we decided that we   d go up this little hill to see  what was up there. It was just the women. We kept going, get a little  higher, and higher, and finally we met a car coming down and there  was hardly any room. Just happened it was enough room that, you  know (you   d look down over here and it was nothing) that you could  pull over and let this car by. Then so we said,    What   s up there?    And  he said,    Nothing.    (Laughter) Nothing was up there. It was  somebody   s place   lived up there, but they had a gate, you know, and  just enough to turn around and come back down. So that cured us of  exploring, because you get lost in those mountains and that   s bad.  (Laughs)  30  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Wooten  L. Forrester  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  Wooten  Finchum  We used to have a lot of fun with them.  Yeah, we did. I know one time, it was a couple there and their little     had a baby, a little girl, and she had a seizure or something. So my  sister knew where the hospital was at the little town from where we  stayed around Wolf Creek Pass, and so we went in the car with them  to show them and that man drove about 100 miles an hour. You talk  about   of course, it happened to be that it was straight. It wasn   t on  the mountains. It liked to scared us just to death because we just knew  we was going to have a wreck. But anyway, we got there in time to do  something for the baby and they had to come pick us up.  Yeah, I did.  You did?  I was barely driving at the time, me and my cousin, which my aunt  and uncle, her sister and her husband, only had one child. They had  me and they had one.  They   re like sisters because they   re the only cousins.  Anyway, they called from the hospital and said,    Come pick us up.     And I said,    What?    Because my dad and my uncle were out fishing.  Good times. Anything else you want to add before we close off?  No, except I just had a wonderful life. I   ve been blessed. Even with  the bad things, you know, you look back and you go on because  there   s nothing you can do about it. So just have to have a good  attitude and just one day at a time.  And take advantage of new gadgets.  Yes. Yes, I love all of it.  Well thank you so much for sharing with us today. We appreciate it.  Well I hope I did all right.  You did great, you did great.  -------  -------  31
