 Finchum Today is September 18, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University.  Williams Okay.  Finchum And today we are in Sperry, Oklahoma to speak with Tommie Williams.  This is part of our Oklahoma One Hundred Year Life project. Thank  you for having us.  Williams Thank you.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Williams I was born in the state of Arkansas. I lived in Little River County. There  in Arkansas in eighteen, somewhere along about 1849 or    50   am I  saying the right thing? Yeah, eighteen. My grandfather came out of  Guinea in Africa and I longed to go there. I had the privilege to visit the  land; the West Bank, Israel, Jerusalem. I had a chance to visit there and  talk with the representatives. You see on TV where the counselor was  standing there giving lectures to Jesus when Jesus was in captivity. Not  the same man, but I stood in that position and listened to that Jewish,  how they explained it, and how they presented themselves to you. There  in a big room, larger than this house, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Esau. I  didn   t get the chance to see exactly where Jesus was but I saw the cave  where he had to go down, a narrow cave. They kept him up there for  four years. I wanted to go on to Bethlehem or Judea, but my time ran  out on my schedule. It was a wonderful time. The beautifulest woman  in the world, picture   s laying on the back of that couch, and she was  like a rock. Pictures that are as clear as anything you want to see.  Beautiful. That   s what I did.  5  Finchum What year were you born?  Williams August 30, 1915.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Williams Sure, most of them are up there. (Gestures to hanging photographs)  Reverend, you   re close. Do you want to kind of raise them up a little  bit?  Finchum How many?  Williams Six boys and four girls. We are right there on the corner where you  started, right there. Start on the corner, there.  Kendrick That   s you and Charles there.  Finchum Were you the oldest or the youngest, or in the middle?  Williams He   s coming into the oldest one right now.  Finchum Okay.  Williams You see a man and his wife setting together there? Right in front of you,  down right there.  Kendrick Yeah.  Williams Yeah. That   s one of my brothers. He pastored over in the state of  Arkansas for years. The other guy right beside him and his wife, is my  oldest brother. He was a joiner of the integration. He was the first Negro  into a white school, first Negro in the state of Arkansas. Along with  that, that is when  inaudible  decided to go. He gave them the privilege  to go to this public school right here in Ashdown. The amazing thing is  that it got the man calling and went down to see what was going on. His  secretary was the judge   s wife, of Arkansas. See what I mean? Now,  that is something to think about.  Bishop Yeah.  Williams Yeah, think about it. See, and you can see the next lady opposite of him,  (gestures to photographs) that   s another one of my sisters. She  graduated from Tennessee State and she died with cancer at an early  age, cancer and an ulcer carried her off. This is Truman, my brother,  and you know who that is in the middle (referring to himself). Next one  there would be my oldest sister. She taught school and her husband  6  taught school. This other girl on the end, the next to the oldest was a  beautician. That is all about the history of the family there.  Finchum That   s pretty impressive.  Bishop Were you the middle child?  Williams Uh, what did you call it? Four girls, six boys     Bishop Where did you fall in the lineup?  Williams The lineup would be, actually I would be right almost half way.  Bishop Almost half way     Finchum Where did you go to school?  Williams I graduated from the Ashdown High School. Two years in Dunbar  Junior College. I left there and went to Langston University two and a  half, little better than half. I was getting all my degrees together, and  President Roosevelt wanted a better job for me so he sent a greeting.  Bishop Got     Williams A greeting from Uncle Sam on it. (Laughs) That subsequently fouled  me up. That   s what I got.  Finchum Which branch of the military?  Williams The Army Airforce.  Finchum Did you get to finish college first?  Williams No. Number two, it was a hundred and twenty-eight of us and Flight  139. We were all pulled out of our degrees and put under a captain. The  war, under Patton the regiment crossed the Rhine River. When they  crossed the Rhine River, they was bringing those boys back. I was  stationed in Syracuse, New York. They brought those guys back and we  took to commanding and training those guys to get them back to  themselves. They was real shocked. It was something to see. Yeah. I  was in Rome, Syracuse, and Alaska for about three months. I didn   t like  that part of the world, a little too cold for me, (laughs) a little too cold.  Finchum How long were you in the service?  Williams Four years.  7  Finchum Four years.  Williams That was that. Uh, the hundred and twenty-eight, we all were  discharged, but we had a chance to get pretty good jobs when we got  out, that   s what it was. The promotions were frozen. The changeover  from President Roosevelt   s  death , yeah   I went back as far as  Coolidge, but anyway. This is where the gray area enters into it. I came  home a free man.  Finchum Came home a free man.  Williams Yeah.  Finchum What year,    45,    46?  Williams Then?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Williams Actually it would be the thirteenth day of March in    45.  Finchum You got it down  (Laughter)  Williams Yeah.  Finchum Where was home, you said you came back home, was it Arkansas?  Williams I moved here to Tulsa. Me and my wife had married just about six  months before I received the greeting from President Roosevelt.  Bishop How did you meet your wife?  Williams We went to school together. I was an industrial arts major at that time. I  always felt like I didn   t give up on things. I could almost fix anything.  We had a little saying,    If it   s not broke. Don   t fix it.    Those were some  of the things we went through.  Finchum Industrial arts? What was her major?  Williams Home economics.  Finchum Was this at Langston, when you met her?  Williams At Langston.  8  Finchum What was her name?  Williams Name?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Williams Nannie G. Williams. Right up above the door up there. Up high. When  she finished with everything, she went to OU, got a masters. And she  went on and got her doctorate. Later on, she became, all over the county  of Tulsa, over the Human Services and would travel around with the  educational director of Human Services. I can   t remember his name.  His daughter taught school here in Sperry. He would always write a  letter to her and tell her to stop by the Williams   . That kind of thing. It  was very interesting. I lost too many friends. I made friends.  Finchum What brought you from Arkansas to Oklahoma?  Williams Uncle Sam   s Army. When I came to Langston, they send me the  greeting from Arkansas,    Go back to Arkansas. Little Rock, Camp  Robertson.     Finchum Well, you graduated from high school in Arkansas.  Williams Ashdown, yeah.  Finchum You knew about Langston even then?  Williams In my family there were, I guess, fifty to seventy-five first cousins and  brothers and sisters. We met together and we traveled to each state. This  is how we worked together. I was supposed to be a real basketball  player. The boy that played with me up until we went to college, he  called me Krypton. We had a signal that he would give me and I would  break and I would make an X on that campus. When I make that x, I  would go in front of it, that ball would hit that ring. Sure did. That   s the  way I come up. Went through Langston. Played Virginia, played  Tennessee State, Tuskegee. I don   t even know what schools I played  with now.  Bishop So you played ball?  Williams Basketball.  Bishop What position?  Williams Traveling goal thrower mostly. Yeah, that   s what it was.  9  Finchum Did you play guard or center or     Williams I played guard a while. Through high school, there was three of us when  we were first starting. We always played all the way through a game.  They   d call me out and give me a signal to go back. And I   d take it back  to these other two. That is what we would do.  Bishop Now, did you play on any dirt courts?  Williams Gravel courts.  Bishop Gravel court.  Williams Sawdust court. Oh, that kind of thing. Yep. I wasn   t bad at baseball. I  wasn   t bad. I didn   t believe that a pitcher would throw three straight  balls by me. (Laughter) I didn   t believe it.  Finchum Hit a few homeruns?  Williams Not too many. I was safe to get on base, and I could run.  Finchum Stole a few bases then?  Williams Oh, a few of them  (Laughs) A few of them, yeah.  Bishop Did you play in a league? When you were growing up did you play in a  league?  Williams No, no. I was scheduled to play for the Kansas City Monarchs. They  played seven days a week. My dad, he was a Baptist preacher. He didn   t  want me playing ball on Sunday. That   s what stopped it right there.  Bishop So the Kansas City Monarchs wanted you?  Williams I didn   t play with them.  Bishop But they wanted you to?  Williams Yeah. I was supposed to be a short stop, second baseman. Yeah.  Finchum So your father was a preacher?  Williams Yeah.  Finchum Did he do any other jobs?  10  Williams Well, we had a farm.  Finchum Had a farm     Williams Old MacDonald had a farm, (laughter) E-I-E-I-O  (Singing)  Finchum You had to do a few chores then?  Williams Quite a few  Anything around the farm, I can almost tell you about it.  Raising cattle, even after I came out of service I had one of the finest  ranches of cattle right out here between Fifty-first and Forty-first.  Yeah     Finchum Was it a farm or ranch?  Williams Aw, farm.  Finchum Farm.  Williams Uh-huh, and I worked with agricultural folks.  Finchum Okay.  Williams Yeah.  Finchum When you were younger, did you have to milk the cows and all that  good stuff?  Williams Anything to be done on a farm, I done.  Finchum You did it   Williams Yeah.  Finchum What was the house like that you grew up in?  Williams Had four sisters, and Mother taught the six boys how to cook and fix the  meal. After I married, our job was separate. If I beat my wife home, I  started dinner, I fixed dinner. I never heard her say,    I don   t want this.     (Laughter) We sit down.  Finchum What were some of your specialties?  Williams Whatever crossed my mind, yeah, yeah.  Bishop So your mother taught you to cook?  11  Williams Taught me to cook.  Finchum Could you do biscuits?  Williams Sure  Cornbread, all that stuff, pancakes, you name it   Finchum Well, if you cooked, would she clean up?  Williams She would mostly clean up. If it was kind of bad on the outside, I   d  come in and join her. She   d dust and I   d run the sweeper. That kind of  deal.  Finchum So your primary income for yourself was a farmer?  Williams Yeah.  Finchum I   m impressed that you cooked dinner   Williams I don   t know how many plates, different plates   Finchum Good at fried chicken?  Williams Sure.  Finchum Did you have chickens?  Williams Everything that grew on a farm.  Finchum Everything, so yes   Bishop If Mom taught you to cook     Williams Right.  Bishop Chicken was a key staple back in the day.  Williams Right.  Bishop Who would she send out to go get the chicken?  Williams Right. Today, your chickens all come from around Arkansas, a  brooding house, and those chickens never saw the floor or the ground.  They   re on sawdust and sand. You see what I mean? This is a secret.  I   m not supposed to tell you this. You know why you don   t buy a  12  chicken   s foot, you   re finding that out. When you go to the store, they  cut off that long part. You don   t ever see the claws     Finchum That   s true   Williams That   s because they   re walking on this straw and stuff and webbed.  They cut that off, the feet and all that stuff. That   s going on today.  Finchum Well, when you were younger, would you have to kill the chicken or  would your mother?  Williams Oh, I had to kill them.  Finchum You had to?  Williams She might say,    Tommie, go out there and bring me one of those fryers  or two of them,    and I   d go out there and wring its neck off and bring it  on in.  Finchum Just the way of life, wasn   t it?  Williams It was a way of life, right.  Finchum Well, how would she do laundry for that many children?  Williams We had, I believe there was three, one, two, three tubs, that   s where she  would do them. Of course, she wouldn   t let them all pile up at once.  Finchum Had to do some every day.  Williams My mother, she had the girls and the boys help do those types of things  and we   d help her.  Finchum You would help her?  Williams Sure.  Finchum And outside?  Williams Outside the girls could milk a cow or anything of that nature, but the  boys were handling the stock, the cattle, all this kind of thing. What we  had was different jobs, that each one of us would do.  Finchum Have to get up pretty early?  Williams Around six thirty or seven, five thirty or six sometimes.  13  Finchum Do them before school?  Williams Sure  First I had to walk right at three miles to school.  Finchum One way?  Williams One way.  Finchum Wow   Williams And there was about twenty-five or thirty of us. We would go. Gravel  road, a dirt road.  Finchum Was the school a one-room, two-room?  Williams Mostly two starting, it didn   t last long. In Arkansas they put up a  Rosenwald school.  Finchum Rosenwald?  Williams Uh-huh.  Finchum Uh-huh.  Williams And they built those high schools around like that.  Finchum Did you go to one of those?  Williams Yeah, where I went to.  Finchum There   s a few of them left.  Williams There   s a few but they   ve almost cleaned them out.  Finchum So what year did you graduate high school? Thirty-three, two?  Williams Thirty-six, I believe it was.  Finchum Thirty-six. Okay. Did your mother sew much?  Williams Oh yeah. All of us can sew, Mother and all of us. Most of us started  with putting a button back on your shirt.  Finchum Did she teach you that too?  14  Williams Sure. No, not this shirt. I could show you several shirts my wife made  for me, and pajamas. She made them for me.  Finchum That   s pretty impressive too, to be able to do that. People don   t do that  much anymore.  Williams People don   t do that at all. You can   t find a seamstress around here.  Finchum Well, did they quilt too?  Williams Ah yeah. Quilts back there, she called it a Star quilt or something, made  like a star. Step there at the door, on the table there, that   s got  everything on it, she made a tablecloth to fit that table. It won first prize  here at the fair. My mother carried it to Texarkana at the four-state fair  and it won one. Went to Oklahoma City and done that same thing. Step  right there at the door.  Finchum Your mother made it or your wife made it?  Williams My wife.  Finchum Your wife made it.  Williams But they worked together. See it there?  Finchum It   s crochet. It   s pretty.  15  Bishop Did you have horses, mules?  Williams Yeah, yeah. My dad had five of them. We could use mules, horses, and  a few cows. We rode everything that went through that barn, (laughter)  as the boys. Mother raised them and would make us take the honey jar  and we hung it around their neck and made them pretty.  Bishop When you farmed here, was your farm or your ranch near Sperry?  Williams Near Sperry, nah. It was near Broken Arrow.  Bishop In Broken Arrow?  Williams Between Forty-first and Fifty-first.  Bishop It   s changed quite a bit in that area.  Williams The developers decided they needed the land more than I do.  Finchum You said it was on Indian land? Is that what you said?  Williams No, it wasn   t. I bought it direct, now wait, I believe the guy was a  German guy. One whole mile section he give me the privilege to buy  forty acres of it, eighty acres of it. I   ve had cows, what you call beef  cattle, the Black Angus, the Holstein, the Polled Herford and the  Limousin. Those are real beef cows. After a while with that, my wife  took sick and she got down and down and down. Had to give it up.  Bishop How long did you farm? Raise those cattle?  Williams I don   t know the exact date. Anyway, I say it starts at    46,    47.  Bishop You raised cattle for quite some time   Williams Yeah.  Kendrick He just sold his cattle in the last couple of years.  Bishop At a hundred more or less.  Kendrick Like ninety-five, ninety-six.  Bishop Wow  Did you ever go to the sale, like in Oklahoma City?  Williams Yeah, I knew the guys that owned the sale barn over at Tulsa County. If  I was going to sale, I   d tell the guy I had twenty-five or fifty that I want  16  to sell. He would come out and take a look at them and say,    Oh, let   s  sell this one,    and he   d come out and pick them up.  Finchum They came and picked them up? They did a little bit of the work for you.  Williams That saved me from hauling them. Yep. Yep. So that   s it, or as they say,     This is my story.    (Laughter)  Finchum Well, did you have children?  Williams No children.  Finchum No children.  Williams Now, I helped raise three. My sister, my next oldest sister, she came  down with arthritis. Her husband left Arkansas and went to California  during the shipyard days. He never returned. I and my wife took care of  the children, helped.  Bishop So they never returned, but the children stayed?  Williams Yeah.  Bishop And you raised them?  Williams Right, put them through school.  Finchum Were they in FFA or 4-H?  Williams The boy was in 4-H.  Finchum I figured with working on the farm, someone would have been.  Williams Right.  Finchum Had projects.  Williams Right.  Finchum Well, do you remember your first tractor?  Williams Sure.  Finchum New or used?  Williams Aww, it was used. It was hard to find a new one when I started.  17  Finchum After the war it would have been, yeah, true.  Williams Right.  Finchum You had to get on a list or something.  Williams You see, different automobile plants stopped building cars and built  tractors and airplanes. That is what happened there. Yep.  Finchum Would you take your cattle to the show, to the fair and show them off?  Williams Part of them. What I would do, some of those ag guys would say,    Let   s  take this one Tommie, let   s take this one.    Maybe four or five, take  them out there and be there four or five days or better. Yeah.  Finchum Then you would sell the one that won?  Williams Aww   you know what, you   d bring those cows back home and you sell  them individually.  Finchum Better to do it that way?  Williams You   d come out ahead.  Finchum Come out ahead. Well, did you keep your records in your head or on  paper?  Williams Both. (Laughs)  Finchum Both.  Williams Both. Well, in my time, I learned how to give them vaccinations and  everything like that. I didn   t have to worry about running through the  lot. I had them lined up, give them a shot and kept going or maybe two  or three shots. Well, that   s just about my story.  Finchum Well, your dad was a preacher.  Williams Uh-huh.  Finchum Did your mother do any work outside of the home?  Williams Not too much   Finchum She was too busy with the kids   18  Williams Yeah.  Bishop I want to know, you grew up with a preacher. How important was  church in your family?  Williams Everyone I know of, that   s alive today, belongs to somebody   s church. I  have about four brothers-in-law are pastors; Curtis, Leopold   and we  all talked about it. Yeah.  Bishop Did you ever have to go listen to your father   s sermons every Sunday?  Williams Not every Sunday  He pastored at a church a little ways from us. He  was there every night. Mother was the counselor. She said,    This, that,  that.    That   s what it was all about. That   s what she did. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, when one of you got in trouble, who would discipline?  Williams If we didn   t settle it before we got home, we didn   t get that far.  (Laughs) We didn   t do any fighting. Mom wouldn   t have it. Yeah, very  rare. Like I say, we were all relatives, brothers, sisters, sharing, mostly  brothers. That type of thing.  Finchum Well, did the house have running water?  Williams In the beginning it didn   t, no. We had a well and drawed it with a rope.  Then we got a pump put on and drop it down in that well. It was nice  having water and we run the water into the house, yeah.  Finchum How would you do bath time?  Williams Bath time?  Finchum Uh-huh. Back in the day?  Williams We had a large special tub, number three or number two tubs. (Laughs)  Yeah.  Finchum And you heated the water on the stove?  Williams Yeah.  Finchum More than one used the same water?  Williams No, no  You used your own water.  19  Finchum I had to share with my sisters   Williams Now, on the back of the cook stove, a big oven like, that when you   d  get the water, like when you were fixing a meal, the heat goes back over  that water. It   d hold ten gallons or better and that   s where we   d get it.  And if you were running short, you   d be reminded to get more so you  could take a bath.  Bishop You had a large family  What were holidays or special occasions like?  Like Christmas?  Williams We all had a wonderful time  These uncles and aunties on Christmas  coming up, maybe Uncle Johnny   they   d all slit a hog, butcher. She   d  cook a whole hog, all of it because there was going to be fifty of them  coming by. Now, you had to, you wouldn   t eat it, but you had to take a  sandwich along with you from each one of those houses. It was  required. You had to.    Tommie wouldn   t eat none of my cake.    One of  those kind of deals. Whatever we done, if you weren   t careful, it   d beat  you back home. That   s the way it was. And whatever one of those  uncles said to you, disciplining, that   s just the same as your dad and  mother. See what I mean?  Bishop What did you usually get for Christmas as a present?  Williams Mostly anything. As a whole, my dad or mother would take a bale of  cotton out to   along the line, we would take the cotton to the gin with  the seed in it, and they take those seeds off, take the seeds and sell them  to this compress. This oil you have, your baking oil, that   s where it  came from, a big oil mill compress, and they squeeze that oil out of  those seeds and make those cakes. We call them hoe cakes, for cows.  You crumble them up. You see them in these stores out there.  Finchum I hadn   t heard about squeezing the oil out of the seed. That makes since  though.  Williams That   s where your oil starts from.  Finchum Your family grew cotton and picked cotton?  Williams Sure.  Finchum And that was in Arkansas?  Williams Arkansas.  20  Finchum Okay.  Williams I came to Oklahoma when I was grown.  Finchum Oh you were grown.  Williams But I was backing up my dad, helping out, you know.  Finchum Picking cotton pretty hard work?  Williams It was tedious.  Finchum Tedious.  Williams You were in the hot field. The one on guard would sit around, and lay  down and rest, and all like that.  Finchum How would they get the cotton to the gin?  Williams Wagon and trucks.  Finchum Trucks.  Williams Biggest cargo was on the wagon. With the seed in it, it would weigh  around thirteen or fourteen hundred pounds, and with the seeds out it   d  weigh around five hundred or six. That is where you set it. Now, the  seed, mostly the boys got some of that change, but as we grew older and  larger, Mother and Dad would have a consult. They   d say,    The girls  are going to get out here and haul this cotton all around like you all so  you   ll divide it. Whatever you get out of the bales of cotton, you give  some to the girls.    That is the way we did it. Did you know another  thing? I don   t have but one sister, but today she looks to me to send her  things. Yeah, that   s the way it is.    Tommie, you didn   t send me nothing  for my birthday.    (Laughs) You see what I mean? That is what girls  will do for you. (Laughs) Yeah.  Bishop I know that you participated in different groups like Lions Club? Can  you tell us a little bit about that? What would you do for the Lions  Club?  Williams The Lions Club, we would meet and have a pancake breakfast. That  was one of our fund drives. We may go to Sand Springs, we may go to  Sapulpa, district. Different groups, there may be three or four different  clubs in town. The presidents of the clubs, why we   d meet together.  Bishop Were you ever the president?  21  Williams Yeah, might be still. (Laughter)  Bishop Still an active member?  Williams I can   t say active because I can   t attend, but I was.  Bishop What is a typical day like for you today at a hundred? What time do you  usually get up and what do you do during the day? What is a typical  day like?  Williams I always find something to get up. Around five thirty, six o   clock, every  day I   m up. Rain, shine, sleet, or snow, that kind of thing.  Bishop Do you have like a ritual you do during the day, like you do something  a particular way? What kind of things do you do?  Williams If I   m out on the farm, I start out and see that all the animals have been  fed, the chickens and things have been fed. That kind of thing. Then, on  a dreary day like we   re having outside, (I believe you say that you like  winter time), four or five of us, well more than that really, we   d go out  and get some wild duck. That kind of thing. Or pigeons, see? And we   d  go back home. We   d dress them or some of the younger brothers would  help you or they might clean them for you. Those are things. If it was  beautiful we might stop and go fishing.  Bishop I was going to ask you if you ever fished.  Williams Yeah. (Laughter) Yeah, we done all that.  Bishop Did you ever noodle?  Williams A little bit. I was afraid of that. You can get hurt that way.  Bishop I had never heard of it until I moved to Oklahoma. I know they noodle a  lot in Oklahoma and Arkansas.  Williams Yeah, I   ve seen it, some guys do it. When you run your hand back up  under here, don   t know what   s there. You feel that movement, you  catch onto that. It might be a catfish, it might be an alligator gar. You  ever heard of that? You got something on your hand. (Laughs)Those  things are dangerous, so we didn   t do too much of that.  Finchum What time did you get up this morning?  Williams Around six thirty.  22  Finchum And what time will you go to bed?  Williams That depends, not under nine o   clock.  Finchum What will you do this afternoon, after we leave?  Williams After you leave? I find a lot of things to get into   Finchum Do you read much?  Williams Quite a bit.  Finchum Have a favorite author or type of book?  Williams Number one, when my pastor gives out his text, I train over the pieces.  He says,    I   m going to give you the text, the text take you. If you don   t  do anything about it, then you don   t know nothing about our talk.    I  read his scripture over. Now, he better not come across that again next  Sunday.    Hey Rev, we talked about that.    (Laughs) You see what I  mean? That kind of a deal.  Finchum You keep him on his toes   Williams Aw, he has to watch us. He has watchers.  Bishop Did you ever think you would make it to a hundred?  Williams No, no plan.  Bishop What do you think your secret to a long life is?  Williams No secret. You live day by day. Nothing promised you, but I guarantee  you this, it   s all not gold and not sugar. It changes, you can   t depend on  everything. That   s what it is.  Finchum Did anyone else in your family make it to one hundred?  Williams Ira, my first cousin. He made a hundred and four.  Finchum Oh  You got a ways to go then.  Williams (Laughs) Well, you can   t say I   ll make it.  Finchum Can   t say you won   t.  23  Williams My mother made it to ninety-nine, I believe it was. She was the next.  Finchum Was she from Arkansas?  Williams Mostly, but I think she was born in Louisiana.  Finchum What about your dad?  Williams He was born in Arkansas. Well, that   s just about the history. Now over  on this above the TV, those are relatives. The young man was the,  what   d you call it, oh superintendent. He taught several places and came  out of an island in the Virgin Islands. He came here and he could speak  all the languages. Soon enough, he could move around. There   s his wife  and family. Yep.  Bishop Now I understand. Are you a deacon of the church?  Williams That   s what he said.  Bishop Oh yeah   Finchum That   s what he said?  Williams Maybe deacons. (Laughter) No  I get tickled. We don   t have any  trouble. Anything I want to discuss I say,    Hey, wait a minute here.     We talk about it.  Bishop Good.  Williams And if we agree, it   s going on. That   s it.  Bishop How did you celebrate your birthday?  Williams My pastor and the men of the church prepared everything, and I went.  There   s a picture of that with names and things on that.  Bishop Looks like you had quite a few people at your party.  Williams It was, it was. There   s more pictures over there.  Bishop I even see a few kids look like they signed it.  Williams Probably did, probably did. I really have not checked them all out to see  who did. I was just thankful that I was thought of. That   s the way I look  at it.  24  Bishop Did you give them any words of wisdom?  Williams No  No, I just made a little talk and told how I appreciated everything.  That kind of a deal.  Finchum Did you blow out the candles?  Williams Yeah, I done that.  Finchum Were there a hundred?  Williams I don   t know that I counted. There was more than a hundred. Yeah.  There might have been two hundred. (Laughs) The mayor, the associate  mayor, the ex-mayor, a lot of those guys were there. I work with the  agriculture group, Tulsa County, Nowata County, Rogers County, and  Muskogee County. They all sent me some things.  Bishop Kept you in mind   Williams Yeah.  Bishop Oh, neat.  Finchum It was a good day   25  Williams Yeah, good day.  Finchum When did you give up driving?  Williams Uh     Finchum Or have you?  Williams I think I have.  Finchum You think you have. (Laughter)  Williams My problem is that I see so many folk knowing they are too feeble to be  driving. Something always tells me,    You better move over, because  you might get killed or somebody kill you.    I called someone to come  get me. That is the way I do that.  Finchum Okay.  Williams That   s how it goes on  Yeah   Finchum Got a pretty good network of friends, sounds like.  Williams Yep. Yeah.  Finchum Pretty group of friends   Williams Oh, I do. Actually, I don   t know of any of them that we ever had cross  words. Men, women, they all got along with me.  Finchum You haven   t crossed ways, is that what you said?  Williams Cross words.  Finchum Cross words.  Williams Uh-huh.  Finchum You haven   t had cross words.  Williams No.  Finchum You have a good philosophy on life it sounds like, too   Williams (Laughs) Yeah.  26  Bishop I want to know, when history is written, what do you want it to say  about you? How do you want others to remember you?  Williams Remember me as a brother. Love one another. Jesus says,    If you love  me, you will keep my commandments. I will not do anything to hurt  you.    Now these are the things I look at. Yeah. That   s right   Finchum Well, did you ever think you would live to see an African American  president?  Williams No, no. Never did. It shocked me. Remember me saying earlier one of  my brothers was elected as the principal of the high school in that  climate. How was he chosen out of all these others? See what I mean?  That started you to wonder. Yeah.  Finchum Well, did you ever spend any time in Boley?  Williams Boley, a little bit.  Finchum Little bit?  Williams Yeah, rode a few horses there.  Finchum At the rodeo?  Williams Yep, at the rodeo.  Finchum You rode the horses?  Williams Sure.  Finchum That   s the longest running rodeo in Oklahoma isn   t it? One of the  oldest?  Williams Sure, one of the oldest.  Finchum One of the oldest.  Williams Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys played to one of the largest crowds  that I remember.  Finchum Well, Boley was a pretty happening little town back in the day.  Williams Oh it was  It was  Yes. Yeah   27  Finchum I think their basketball team was pretty good at one point, too.  Williams One, yeah, uh-huh.  Bishop I know some folks have told us they used to go there to dance.  Williams To dance?  Bishop On the weekends  Williams Yeah. Well, that was the fun part after. After you had all kinds of  barbecue and exhibits and things, and the seniors fed and all that, it was  kind of remarkable you know, in Boley. I drove my truck there with a  camper on it. It was loaded with at least a 150-200 loafs of bread. I   d  help the guys fix the different sandwiches. We would have a big time   Big time   Finchum Your mother   s lessons came in handy that day, too.  Williams Right.  Finchum Helping with the food.  Williams Right.  Bishop I think you may be the first man we   ve met that knew how to cook.  (Laughter)  Finchum Or admitted it   Bishop Yeah, or admitted it.  Williams Cooking, as I said, my mother started it all. When I left Little Rock and  went to Langston, I didn   t like the dormitory food there. A first cousin  of mine, we got us a room out in town and we   d fix our meals. They   d  call me over,    Well, is dinner ready?       Well, let me think about it.     (Laughs) Yes, sir  Yep. We had fun.  Finchum Did you have to work in order to pay your tuition?  Williams Partly  Yeah, partly. I was the kind of guy, and still am, that never just  sat around and wanted a handout. I could cut hair. I have a state license,  Oklahoma.  Finchum A barber?  28  Williams Yeah. Sure was, yeah. So there is that.  Finchum Been a pretty good life?  Williams I don   t regret any of it. I saw some bad days and good days. We walked  in the rain, and I put the little brother and sister on my back and carried  them, and all this kind of thing. In might seem hard but they loved to  have their arms around my neck and go for a ride.  Finchum You carried both of them at one time?  Williams No, one at a time.  Finchum You were a good big brother.  Williams That   s kind of the deal. That   s it.  Finchum Well, is there anything else you want to say before we cut off?  Williams I don   t have anything particularly. I   ve enjoyed you all coming by and  talking, and so forth.  Finchum We sure appreciate you.  Bishop I   ve got one last question.  Williams Okay.  Bishop Even though you   re one hundred, do you have anything left on your  bucket list? Something you want to do that you have never done before?  Williams No, no qualms with that.  Bishop Nothing you didn   t do?  Williams No.  Finchum Just to make it to 104   Williams Whatever the number is. Whatever the number is. (Laughs)  Finchum All right, well thank you for talking with us today.  Williams I never will forget, in high school we went to a little old town called  Texarkana, our baseball team. All the players on our team didn   t show  up, and all the other team didn   t show so we mixed in together. I  29  remember getting on bases but they told me later on, a week or day or  two,    Do you know the scores we made?    I said,    No.       You made all  three of them.    That made me kind of want to holler out loud. I always,  I didn   t give up on you. Yeah. Those were the things that I reminisce  with. As far as fighting, drinking, smoking, gambling, never had that  kind of money. Certainly not at that time.  Finchum Well, if you had had the money, you probably wouldn   t have done it  either?  Williams No, I wouldn   t have. I had too many what you call them, guards or  overseers that would see it. Plus I had different coaches that respected  me. I could play a whole game without giving up. Person that smoked  and gambled and all that, out every night, he can   t run a quarter. I   d run  nearly the whole game.  Finchum Good shape. Good physical shape.  Williams Yeah.  Finchum Still are.  Williams My doctor said that I   m in pretty good shape. I don   t know.  Finchum Well, all right. We   ll say thank you.  Williams Okay, and I appreciate everything.  Finchum All right.  -------  -------
