No, not that large. About eighty acres.  And what were a few of your chores?  Milking the cow and feeding the pigs. (Laughs)  Did you have to walk to school?  Yes, ma   am. It was a one-room   up through eighth grade   one room  school then.  How many were in your class?  Oh, that   s a long time ago. (Laughter)  Probably not too many, though.  No, not too many. Not like there are today.  What was the name of the school?  Blue Cut School.  And you finished the eighth grade there?  Finished the sixth grade there.  Then where did you go?  Bristow.  Your family moved there?  Yes, ma   am.  So where did you finish high school?  In Bristow.  Do you remember what year?  In thirty-three.  Okay, at the beginning of the Depression.  6  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Yes.  Can you talk about that a little bit? What were times like for you?  Well, we didn   t have anything. Nobody else had anything. We were all  in the same boat. Just how to have a living, is all we had.  Did anyone you know work for the WPA  Works Progress  Administration  type programs in the    40s?  My dad worked for WPA, yeah.  What did he do for them?  Just whatever they had to do.  So once you finished high school, what did you do?  What did I do? Well, I got married and I went to work. I went to work  for Safeway   3rd of December 1933.  How long did you work for them?  Fifteen years.  That   s a pretty long time.  Yes.  What was your wife   s name?  Elizabeth.  How did you meet her?  Well, I really don   t know exactly how I met her. Her father was a  schoolteacher or a superintendent of the schools in Rogers County. I met  her on the street one day with a group of friends, and I said,    I didn   t  know Mr. Dougherty had such a pretty girl.    (Laughter) It just went  from there.  That   s a pretty good pickup line.  Yeah. (Laughter) It was a long time ago.  7  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Fifteen years with Safeway, what did you do for them?  I was manager of a store, a grocery store.  Where, here in Cushing?  Well, here in Cushing the last eight years with them.  So the town has changed a lot since then?  Yes, it has.  You were in Bristow in    33?  Yes.  When did you move to Cushing?  Oh, I don   t remember.  Sometime in the    40s?  Yes.  Did you serve in World War II?  No.  A little old for that, I guess. Do you remember much about when the  boys came home from the war?  I don   t remember a whole lot about that. I remember when they had the  Race Riot in Tulsa in 1921.  What do you remember about that?  The whites burned them out. People streamed down Pine Street by our  house getting out of there     So you lived in Tulsa for a while after Claremore?  No, I never did live in Tulsa. We were about eleven miles out at that  time.  That   s a long time ago, too.  8  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Son  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Son  Bishop  That is a long time ago.  After you stopped with Safeway, where did you go from there?  Into the grocery business for myself.  In Cushing?  Yes.  And what was the name of that store?  Allton Grocery. Allton-Barnes, first. I had a partner. Barnes was the  meat man, and I ran the grocery business.  And how long did you do that?  Well, I did that for five years with him and I bought him out. I was there  another five years. In 1963, I closed that one and then bought another  one.  I   m just curious, where was your original store in Cushing?  You know where the big wash building is up here? The laundry, you  know where that is?   Bill   s son joins the interview. His name is also Bill Allton   Your first one was on Main Street.  Yeah, that is where my last one was.  So your first one was on Main Street?  Yes.  Did you enjoy that   ?  He started in Stillwater with Safeway. That   s where my oldest sister was  born. They moved into Drumright, that   s where I was born, and then to  Chandler, and then to Cushing. That   s where he ended, in Cushing. They  had the store up there. They tore up the highway, ruined the business     got up here in this building on Oak Street. They wanted out so he got it.  Location, Location, Location.  9  Son  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Son  Allton  Son  Finchum  Allton  Yes, yes. (Laughter)  So pretty much in a fifty mile radius.  Yes.  Did you enjoy the grocery business?  Yes, I did.  Do you have a favorite memory from the grocery business?  No.  Any story you can tell us that you enjoyed about it?  Well, no, nothing exciting. Just worked your tail off is all. (Laughter)  Did they have bag boys back then?  Bag boys? Hmm   no.  Any interesting customers?  Interesting customers? As long as they paid their bill, they were  interesting enough. (Laughter) A lot of it was done on credit.  Especially during the    40s, I bet.  Yeah. I lot of it.  So when did you retire, then?  Retired?    77, wasn   t it?  I think it was.  Shut them all down and sold out to him and I quit it.  He had two laundries by then.  So you branched out from the grocery business to the laundry business?  Well the laundry business was in the grocery. The grocery store up here  was in front and the laundry in the back.  10  Son  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Son  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  The other was on Main Street.  Had one down on Main Street.  Were they called Allton   s Laundromat, or what?  No.  This one is Highland Laundry, and that one is Econo-Wash.  What was a typical day for you when you worked? How early did you  wake up and how late did you leave? What did you do during the day in  the grocery business?  What did you do?  Yeah, what was a typical day like for you?  Well, you just waited on the customers. I opened up by seven o   clock  and closed about six. Then go back and work after hours   course, we  were union but they didn   t help us any. We could still go back and work  at night at the Safeway.  Open on Sundays?  No. Didn   t sell beer, either. (Laughs)  So as the owner and manager, you did a lot of ordering of supplies?  Yes.  Buy from local farmers?  Some.  Was it hard to keep a butcher?  Yes, it was. In fact, I had one, two, three   I had three come and go.  Finally, I started it myself.  They   re kind of hard to find these days, I   m told.  I imagine. I have a little dent there in my ring from my butchering. I hit  my band saw with it. Knocked a little chunk out of it   see how close  that come to a finger? (Laughter)  11  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Son  Allton  Son  Bishop  Allton  Son  Allton  Son  Allton  Son  A little too close. Do you remember getting your first car?  Oh, yes. Let   s see, I don   t know how old I was when I got it. I was living  with my mother-in-law   s sister at the time. Got an old Ford. Boy, that   s  been so long ago. That   s far back   hoooeeeey.  How did you learn to drive it?  How did I learn to drive it? I just got in there and drove it. (Laughter)  Step on the brake and holler,    Whoa      But it didn   t have a horse, though. (Laughter)  No. (Laughter)  When you were married, when did you start having children?  Well, we had     Got married August 15th. Yesterday would have been the seventy-seventh  anniversary. That was in    36. Norma was born in    37. I was born  in    38. That   s when you moved to Cushing, because I learned to walk.  Pat was born in    43.  The day I was nine months old, I walked. We lived in Cushing.  Now, family grocery stores and family businesses like that usually  involved family. Did you make your kids work with you in the store? Did  they ever have to work?  Did you work? (Laughs)  Well, remember when they thought you had a brain tumor? I quit  seminary and came home. Remember?  I don   t remember.  Fortunately, he didn   t have   it was an inner-ear infection.  Couldn   t find any brain    (Laughter) Figured there wasn   t a tumor  there, they couldn   t find a brain. (Laughter)  Anyway, I stayed and helped him and had a church on the weekend.  That was until    77. Then he retired and I got full-time in the church.  12  Finchum  Allton  Son  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Som  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  After you retired, what did you do?  I didn   t do anything. Eat and sleep.  Went fishing. Had the motor home. You all traveled around a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you have a favorite place you traveled in retirement?  Oh, not a favorite place. We went to Colorado, went down in the valley.  Always heard how nice it was down in the valley, you know? Warm. So  we went down there and it was misty and damp, and we wrapped her up  and come home. (Laughter) But we had a big motor home and had a  good boat, which we pulled around with us. We were in a group of about  six families who went together. We   d go camping. Boy, that   s so far  back.  Did you enjoy fishing?  Yes, I loved to fish.  Do you have a good fishing tale?  Do I have a good fishing tale? Well, about the biggest one I ever caught  was about that long. (Laughter) No, I have no big fishing tales.  Fishing here in Oklahoma   one of the big things is noodling. Did you  ever noodle?  (Laughs) One time.  What was that like? What happened?  What happened? Well, I learned better. (Laughter) Get your hand up  under a rock and get it bit off. One time was enough.  He went with me walking across the Cimarron and I turn around to say  something to him and just see his hat floating. He   d stepped in a hole.  (Laughter)  You did that in the Cimarron River.  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness. (Laughter) Can you describe a typical day for you,  13  Allton  Son  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Son  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Son  Finchum  Allton  Son  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Son  Finchum  currently, at 100? What is a typical day like for you?  Typical day for me, now? Go eat breakfast, come back home and go to  bed   sleep. Get up, eat supper and go back to bed. I don   t do anything.  He reads quite a bit. He   s a speed reader. He can really read.  What time do you usually eat breakfast?  About ten o   clock.  Do you eat with a group of people?  I eat with him and a man and his wife   friends of ours. We usually meet  over there. Have for, what, two years, Bill?  Yeah, two years at least. Sam says four, but he   s a lawyer, so he can   t  keep track of time. (Laughter)  What do you normally order?  Bacon, scrambled  egg , hash brown, biscuit and a large sausage gravy.  That   s usually what I eat.  Do you clean your plate?  I do. (Laughter)  Sam usually gives him half of his gravy and I give him half of mine.  So that   s the secret to living to 100?  I guess. I guess so.  He gets a large tea, unsweetened.  I   ve varied it at times and it still doesn   t taste right.  Other than that, what do you think has contributed to your long life?  The good Lord looked after me. That   s the only thing.  I think he   s right.  I think that sense of humor has something to do with it, too.  14  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Son  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  How important has religion been in your life?  Religion? Well, it has been very important.  How? Can you say how?  Well, I don   t know. It just came naturally.  Do you still go to church, today?  I do.  Every Sunday.  What denomination?  Christian.  Did your parents go to church, too, then?  We lived out in the sticks, you might say. No, my parents didn   t go to  church. We were a long way from where they had a church. We didn   t  go, not when I was growing up. Didn   t start going to church until after I  was married.  Your wife, would her family go to church?  Yes, they did.  When you were growing up, how many brothers and sisters did you  have?  Two sisters and two brothers.  Where were you in that order?  Two sisters, one brother that was older than I and one younger than I.  In the middle, almost. Can you describe the house you grew up in?  Well, it wasn   t too much of a house.  Running water?  Running water? No.  15  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Son  Allton  Son  Allton  How was it heated?  An old stove, a potbellied stove is how it was heated.  And you   d do your studying by lamp? Gas-oil lamp?  Yes.  What would you do for fun?  For fun? (Laughs) Oh, lord. I don   t know. I was rowdy. What did I do  for fun, huh?  A swimming hole or pick up jacks, or   ?  No, no.  Kick the can?  No. (Laughs) No. For fun     Claremore had to have something that was fun.  I don   t know what it was. (Laughter) I don   t know what it was.  I want to go back. Where did you take your wife on your first date? What  did you do?  Went to a picture show, I think.  In Claremore?  Yes.  How did you pop the question?  (Laughs) I think she popped the question. (Laughter)  I said they ought to read the letter Mother wrote you while she was able  to still think. She knew she was losing it so she wrote him a letter.  I still have it in yonder.  I read it the other day.  You did?  16  Son  Allton  Son  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  She said the first time she met him, she told the girls,    He   s mine if I  never get him.     And then she wished she hadn   t. (Laughter)  No, she didn   t. There   s nobody like him.  So went to a picture show   who was a typical actor you   d go see or  want to watch back in those days? Who was your favorite or what was  your favorite movie?  Oh, man, I don   t know. I have no idea.  Did music play a role? Did you listen to the radio or play the piano or  sing or anything like that?  Did I? I had the radio. Did I sing? No, I didn   t sing.  Go dancing?  That   s one thing I wish I had learned to do is dance. I regret that because  people have so much fun dancing. I regret that I never learned how to  dance.  Never too late   Well, my legs won   t let me dance anymore.  You can do the Waltz.  The Waltz is what I love. Beautiful dance. Yep, that   s one regret I have,  is that I never did.  Did you ever think you   d live to be 100?  Never gave it a thought.  When you turn ninety-nine, did you think,  one more year?     (Laughter) Oh, Lord. He   s been awful good to me.  How did you celebrate your 100th?  We had a big party. How many was there? Fifty-some?  17  Son  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Son  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Yeah, about fifty-some. I took the paper home with me yesterday. They  didn   t put a very big picture in, but we got everybody lined up outside of  Joseph   s  Fine Foods . The picture is about this big. (Gestures) They had  his name right once, and then misspelled it in the article. I wrote the  article, and then they redid it, which they always do. I knew they would  mess it up. Anyway. There was fifty-something and we had a good time.  He got a lot of accolades. None of the cousins or anybody else there had  anybody that was 100. It was quite a deal.  I remember last time, you said you were a member of the school board.  Yes.  That was here in Cushing?  Yes.  Can you tell us a little bit about what you did and some of the issues you  had to deal with?  Well, we had a good superintendent, here. He dealt with the issues. I  didn   t deal with it.  Were you on the board during integration in the    60s and early    70s?  No.  No, we started in Cushing my senior year, which was    57. He was on  there, then. It wasn   t an issue. We didn   t think a thing about it. Six or  eight came and we didn   t know the difference.  Who was the superintendent when you served?  His name was Carr, William Carr. He went to Stillwater from here.  Were you ever on a booster club or sports activities or anything while  you were there?  No.  I want to know one thing. Today, what keeps you going?  What keeps me going?  In other words, what gives you purpose?  18  Son  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Breakfast. (Whispers)  (Laughter)  Other than breakfast.  Oh, a big bowl of gravy. (Laughter) Oh, my gosh  I don   t know. I   m  ready to go any time he  the Lord  is ready. When he gets ready for me,  he   ll call me. Not until    so I take it one day at a time.  What would you say your motto to life is? What is your philosophy or  motto? What do you live by?  What do I live by?  Do you have a certain motto you live by or a certain philosophy?  No, I don   t reckon so. I don   t know what it would be.  So you do a lot of reading?  Yes, I love to read.  Do you have a favorite genre or author?  Not especially. I have a lot of stuff here that I read. I   ve got books back  there that were my dad   s, I guess. It   s got his name in it, W.H. Allton.  It   s five or six of them. On my birthday, the boy brought them up from  Texas. He lives in Texas. He brought those books up. I have them in  there and I   ve read three of them, I guess, already. I   m starting another  one there. Way back yonder.  That was a pretty special gift.  Yeah, um-hmm.  What types of books do you read? Do you read fiction? Biographies?  Fiction mostly.  Do you stay current? Do you read the news? I see you   ve got a Time  Magazine. Do you read a lot of current   ?  Yeah, that   s a good little magazine. Time Magazine is.  And newspapers?  19  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  And newspapers.  Do you remember when JFK was assassinated?  Not too     Wasn   t a big deal, here?  No. I remember when there   s one that should be. But I   m not going to  do it. (Laughs)  Let   s change the subject, then. Cushing has a WPA library. Do you go  down there much?  No.  Built by the WPA.  When you think about the world, what do you think, for you, has been  the greatest change that you   ve seen?  Oh, lord. All these new-fangled gadgets they have.  Cell phones?  Cell phones and all these little things you wear on your hip. You can talk  around the world. It is amazing.  That would have changed the grocery business a little bit back in the  day, huh?  Oh, yeah. (Laughter)  Do you use that technology? Do you have any of those little gadgets?  No.  Some people do.  Yeah, yeah, half the little kids you see running around have them. They  work their little thingamajigs. Gosh   have fun with them, I don   t know.  I don   t have one.  Would you exercise much through the years? Would you run or do  anything like that?  20  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  I had both knees operated on. I can   t walk very far until I have to sit  down and rest.  Back when you were working and younger, did you do anything for  exercise on a regular basis?  No.  So that doesn   t get you long life, either, huh?  What?  Exercise is not that important in living to be 100.  Nope. (Laughs)  One thing we haven   t asked you yet is what were holidays like in your  home?  Holidays? Well, I don   t know that they were any different than any other  day.  Like Christmas or Fourth of July, was there ever an event that your  family or you celebrated with your own kids?  I don   t know how to answer that.  In other words, was there a particular holiday that was special?  Usually Fourth of July.  What was special about that?  We   d all go to a meeting somewhere, a family get-together.  What did you usually do?  Just eat and visit, and shoot firecrackers. (Laughs)  Did you have a favorite dish your mother fixed?  A favorite dish    She made the best light bread you ever tasted.  What   s light bread?  21  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Son  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  What   s light bread?  Yeah, I   ve never heard of it.  (Laughter)  He hasn   t, so you   ll have to tell him what light bread is. He doesn   t  know, he   s too young.  Is that right?  I know what it is, but tell him what it is.  Just bake a loaf of bread.  Any particular ingredients?  Well, flour. (Laughter)  I   m not sure why they called it light bread, do you?  No.  I never heard it called that.  I think maybe because it was white on the inside.  She   d bake four or five loaves at a time.  It smells really good.  You bet  It was good. You missed it if you haven   t had light bread.  (Laughter)  What is your favorite food?  What is my favorite food? Gosh. I don   t know if I have any real favorite  foods.  Scrambled eggs, bacon    (Laughter)  Fried Catfish?  Do I like catfish? I like crappie better than I do catfish.  That noodling experience probably changed your mind really quick  22  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  about catfish. (Laughter)  You get catfish over here at the restaurant but it doesn   t taste good. It  doesn   t taste like fish at all. Get as much flavor out of it as you would a  piece of cardboard. (Laughter)  One thing I want to know is, when history is written about you, what do  you want it to say?  (Laughter)  Or what do you want to be remembered for?  I don   t care whether I   m remembered or not. It don   t matter to me a bit.  What about family? How do you want family to remember you?  Well, they all have their own opinion. I don   t know how they   ll  remember. (Laughter)  Would it be a good opinion or bad opinion, do you think?  Well, I hope it   s a good opinion. (Laughs) But after I   m gone, it won   t  make any difference, anyway.  You said you were wearing the ring when you almost got your finger cut  off. What is the significance of the ring?  It is a star ruby   when the light hits it right, there is a star there.  How did you come to have that?  My wife bought it for me.  That   s why it is special, then.  Yeah. I lost my wedding ring. I don   t know where I lost it.  Hopefully not in some hamburger.  I think it was throwing a rod out in the fishing ponds. I think that   s  where it went. I don   t know. This one is loose. See, it will just come   I  wear it on the other finger until this finger gets tired and then I wear it  on this one. I can throw that one off. I   ve lost it a time or two.  Do you still fish today?  23  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  I haven   t been in a long time.  Is there a fishing hole you   d recommend?  There is a good one right out at the edge of town here. There   s a big lake  out there. But I don   t go anymore, afraid to go by myself. Might fall in  and drown, nobody would know where I was. (Laughter) Wouldn   t  make a whole lot of difference.  When you did fish, what kind of bait did you use?  Plugs, mostly.  Did you ever make your own lures or plugs?  No.  Ever go fishing for trout?  Yes, I have a time or two.  That takes a lot of skill.  There   s no trout around here, so I don   t go for trout. Colorado.  I figured if you   ve been to Colorado, you had to try trout fishing.  I remember a bridge there. Right across that river   we   d go down there  and sit on the bridge, watch the fish play in there. There was one great  big sucker. We   d all try to catch him. Finally, a little boy caught him.  Did he throw him back?  Probably not. I don   t know if he did or not.  A little boy caught him?  Yes.  That   s a fishing tale. (Laughs) You ever take a family vacation with your  kids? Did you take them fishing on a vacation?  Yeah, took them fishing. He spent more time running around looking for  crawdads than he fished. (Laughter)  24  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Son  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Son  You had a cabin in Tenkiller?  Yeah.  Did you go there very often?  No. We really didn   t. We gave seven thousand dollars for that place and  sold it for seventeen thousand. All the money I ever made in real estate.  (Laughter)  Being the owner of a store, there probably wasn   t time for a vacation.  No.  Did your wife work?  She did.  In the grocery?  Yes. She worked there.  So who was boss when she was working?  Who was boss? You know, neither one of us tried to be boss. We had a  very happy marriage.  What do you think the secret is to a long and happy marriage?  You   ve got to give and take. You don   t try to be boss. It won   t work.  Anything you want to ask him while we   re going?  No, I don   t think so. You all covered it pretty well.  What?  I was seeing if he wanted to tell any secrets on you.  Any secrets?  He   s not going to tell on you. (Laughter)  He can if he wants to.  I know one thing. I don   t know how many people have come up to me in  25  Bishop  Allton  Bishop  Allton  Finchum  Allton  Son  Finchum  Son  Finchum  Allton  the last ten years and said everybody loves him. They   d say,    I can  remember when my family didn   t have anything and he gave us food. If  it wasn   t for him, I don   t know what we would have done.    A lot of  people have said that to me. He   s just known as a loving, giving man of  integrity. He was contented and when he tells you something, that   s it.  He keeps his word in a world where nobody seems to keep their word.  Getting worse and worse and worse. Makes him shine like a star. My  sisters both say   especially my younger sister. They   re both teachers.  She lives in Broken Arrow   she says,    There is nobody like Daddy,     and she   ll say,    and you.    I   ll say,    I don   t even compare, I   m just trying  to keep up.    When Mother was ill in the hospital, he would not leave.  She had haemophilus influenzae, which is a deadly thing. He would not  leave unless I went up there. When I went up, he   d come home and  shower and shave. One day, one of the nurses said,    I wish I had a man  that loved me like he loves her.     I   ve got one question. If you could give young people advice today, what  would it be?  They wouldn   t take it. (Laughter)  What would you tell them? If someone asked, what would you tell them?  I don   t know what I   d tell them. They wouldn   t take it anyway, it  wouldn   t make any difference.  Your children listened to you, didn   t they?  Pretty well, I think.  Mostly watched him. He didn   t say a lot unless he had to.  Lived by example.  Yep. He was an elder in his church for fifty years, which qualifies you to  be an elder emeritus, which he now is. I was on the same board. He  didn   t talk much, but when he did, everybody shut up and listened. It  was really amazing. It was like he was E.F. Hutton. Do you remember  those ads? He really was. I always thought of that. Mother told me one  time, he didn   t talk much, some of the guys came out to the store and  tried to get him to be part of a coup to get rid of the preacher. He said,    I  won   t have any part of it,    is all he said.  Integrity is a good word to describe him. A life well lived.  Yeah. I   ve had a good life.  26  Son  Allton  Son  Finchum  Bishop  Allton  Son  Finchum  Allton  I did Mother   s funeral. It was a packed out bunch at the church, which is  amazing at that age. Anyway, I made some statement. I can   t remember  what it was, but it wasn   t correct. He raised his hand and said,    That is  not right     (Laughter) Everybody laughed, of course. Didn   t quite get it  right.  I don   t remember what that was.  I don   t either. Shook me up. (Laughter) Never had done this before.  Still keeping him on his toes, then, aren   t you?  Still the parent.  Yes. (Laughter)  Sisters, the one from Roswell, would come home every year. Thelma  and I would take off   we   d never take off from church more than about  three days. That was our vacation each year. Pat, Norma and I and  Thelma, my wife, we   d go to Branson. Mother was bad and they called  hospice in. We   re all here and the hospice lady said,    You   re going to  have to put her in a nursing home because you can   t take care of her.  She has to be turned every hour. It   ll kill you if you do it.    She never  ever wanted to go to a nursing home so we said,    We   re not leaving,  we   re going to stay here and help you decide. See what we can do.        Nope, you go. I   m going to figure out what I want to do.    Of course, he  already knew. So we left, he put her in the nursing home, which is where  she did not want to be. She died before we got back, before our three  days was up. I asked him one day, I said,    I was thinking of a way you  could have given her peace. Instead of saying    I   m taking you to the  nursing home, you could just say I   m putting you in the hospital.        Because that didn   t scare her. I was just thinking of it from that angle.  He looked at me and said,    I   ve never ever lied to your mother, and I  wasn   t starting then.    (Laughs) Well, I guess technically that   s right.  That   s just the kind of guy he is. Good to the core.  Good to the core. I think that   s a good way to end. Thank you very much  for sharing your story with us, today.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
