Davis:

Today is July 25, 1977, and I'm at the home of Dr. Lois Stolz,
who lives right next to the Stanford campus.

She is professor

emerita of psychology, and has taught at Stanford, first on a
part-time basis since 1946, and then full-time until her retirement
in 1957.
Where do you come from, Dr. Stolz?
Stolz:

Where were you born?

I was born in Washington, D.C., and I went to school there,
public school.

When I finished high school, I was a very social

person, and my idea was to go to finishing school, and I picked one.
It was then called Hollins Institute in Virginia (later Hollins
College) and it was, I think, a two-year finishing school, to make
young ladies know how to behave in society.

My brother had a

girl from there who was very beautiful, and I thought if I went
there, I'd become very beautiful, too, and that was where I wanted
to go.

My father just put his foot down, and he said he thought

every girl should be able to earn her own living, if she had to.
He wanted me to go to normal school, in Washington, D.C.

I was furious,

and I felt I almost hated him, and I made up my mind that since I
had to do it, I'd just go there and flunk.

And that was my plan,

(laughter)
Davis:

You really worked out this plan?

Stolz:

Well, you know, not quite as clearly as it is now to me,
but those were my feelings, and my behavior certainly supported that.
When I went to normal school, I sat with a friend of mine in the
last row of the lecture hall, and I would write notes to her, and
draw funny cartoons, and just, you know, pay no attention to what

was going on.

Finally, after a few weeks, she said to me, "Lois,

I can't sit with you anymore; I've got to graduate. I have to have
a job."

And she said, "If I sit with you, I'll never be able to

pass anything."

My social desires overcame my dislike for being

there, so I moved to the front row with her.

And, in the front row,

you can't, you know, act like that, and you have to listen, and I
began to be interested.

Because in high school, in those days,

I'd taken a purely scholastic course, four years of Latin, and so
forth; none of the things had any relation to my life.

But in

normal school, everything was concerned with what was going on
around us.

We had a marvelous woman in biology, and we had to learn

the names of a hundred birds, and to be able to recognize them in
Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.C.
Your Latin must have come in handy at that stage.
Well, not in recognizing birds, but in learning the names.
And then, we had to learn a hundred flowers--I don't know why she
picked a hundred; we had to learn the names of a hundred weeds.
This was all about life around me, and was much more pertinent to
my own interests.

I won't go on into further detail, except to say

that I did graduate from normal school, and I was number one in my
class, and I was president of my class, so that both my social and
intellectual

interests were channeled.

I would say if there's any

one thing in my life that really influenced me to go on into a
professional field, it was this.
that probably is back of this:
became an adolescent.

I think there's one other thing
I'd always loved school, until I

I didn't care for it in high school, but I

3

Stolz:

always loved it in the grades, and I always did well.
liked me because I did what they told me because

The teachers

I liked them.

I

used to play school when I'd come home, when I was in the first and
second grades.
Davis:

Oh, I was going to ask you, did your parents take much active
interest in those early years?

Did they, say, sit down and read

you things?
Stolz:

I really do not remember.

Davis:

Were they working?

Stolz:

My father was a lawyer in Washington, he worked for the
government.

So, actually, going to normal school I think now was

the best thing that had ever happened to me.
Davis:

Was your mother for it, as well?

Did she want you to go?

Stolz:

Well, my mother and father had separated by this time.

I

would never probably have gone to normal school if my mother had
charge of me, because she was very social.

It was really my father's

plan. I was living with my grandmother and grandfather, and father.
My grandmother wanted me to go to Vassar, but my father thought
I should go to normal school, and that's where I went, (laughter)
Davis:

But a normal school, what you're calling normal school, would
have been the preparation for college.

Stolz:

No, it was for teaching.

Davis:

I see; so this was at the college level.

Stolz:

You see, in those days, all teachers in the United States were
trained at normal schools.
school.

It was a two-year course, following high

This requirement of elementary school teachers going four

4

Stolz:

years to college came much later.

At that time, a graduate of the

Washington Normal School, which had a very good reputation got a
position in the Washington, D.C. public schools if you were high up
on the list.

The number of positions open in Washington, D.C. was

limited, but if you didn't get a job in Washington, you'd get one
in Virginia, or Maryland, or somewhere near.
I had some very good teachers [at the Washington Normal School];
for instance, in psychology, we used William James as text book.
Davis:

So you would have been, what, in your early twenties at the
time when you were in normal school?

Stolz:

Let's see, I graduated from high school when I was 18, so I
graduated from normal school when I was 20, and started teaching then

Davis:

I see, okay.

Stolz:

My brother.

Did you have any siblings at all?
I had one brother, he was three years older than

I was.
Davis:

I see.

What was he doing at this stage?

Was he becoming a

teacher or studying?
Stolz:

Oh, no.

He went to college at the University of Tennessee.

Tennessee is where my father--the Meek family--came from.
Davis:

Then what did he go on to do?

Stolz:

He went into business, and he died very suddenly in his
thirties, so he didn't have a very long career.

Davis:

So, I guess between your mother and father, then, you'd say
that your father was kind of the dominant figure;

it seems like

he really played a very important part in kind of motivating you.
Stolz:

At that particular time, yes, as far as I can think back.

I

5

Stolz:

can't remember him as being a dominating personality; he kind of
let things go along, but it was his decision that I go to normal
school, for I certainly had no interest in it.

Davis:

Did your other peers, other boys and girls at the same age, did
they more or less also go on to college, or to normal school? Or
did they go on to finishing school type situations?

Stolz:

No, none of them went to finishing school, that was my own
individual idea.

Some of the girls went to normal school, this

one friend that I was with, and then another friend.

Another friend

went to a private school to train in what we would call home
economics today.

And then she later taught in that field.

But then

some of them went to George Washington University, in Washington, D.C.
After I started teaching, I went to George Washington University
to obtain an A.B. degree.
Davis:

So, in other words, you taught for a few years, and then went
back to the university?

Stolz:

No, no. I did this while I was teaching, because in those days,
if you taught primary school, you only taught a half day.

So, you'd

get your plans for the next day done by one or two o'clock, and then
you'd take a course in the afternoon at George Washington.
Davis:

And that would be towards a graduate degree?

Stolz:

Towards an A.B. You see, I only had two years at normal.

Davis:

Oh, I see, you [were] going towards your bachelor's.

Stolz:

And they gave you credit for a certain amount of your work in
normal school, and you went on.

Davis:

To get your bachelor's; I see.

6

Stolz:

So, I finally got my bachelor's degree at George Washington.

Davis:

With a major in psychology?

Stolz:

No, I majored in education and sociology at that time.

Davis:

I see.

So, do you remember from that period at George Washington

any particular teachers that you had that were very influential in. . . ?
Stolz:

Yes, there was a man who was the dean of the school of education,
his name was Carl Rudeger.

He was of German background, and had

grown up in one of those German towns in Wisconsin.
in education.

He taught courses

There was another professor, who was probably more

influential on my social philosophy than anyone I've ever worked
with.

His name was Robert Kern.

He was professor of sociology, a

liberal, and a very strong individualist.

I had had very little

sociology, I don't think I'd had any course called sociology until I
began working with him.
Washington that

I would say those were the two at George

I certainly enjoyed.

I used Watson's Behaviorism

as my psychology text at George Washington, but I can't remember
the name of the professor that taught it.

So, he didn't have much

influence as a person, but the book did.
Davis:

So, could you talk a little bit about how you then went on, after
you did finish your A.B. degree, and presumably, you were still teaching.

Stolz:

No, that isn't quite the way it happened.

I taught in Washington,

D.C. in the first grade for four years, and then I was made what
they called in those days "model teacher."

This meant that you

taught a half a day as a demonstration teacher.

Washington had

the plan that teachers were given three days a year in which to observe
certain designated teachers.

That was a way of increasing their

So, I had to teach one month in the morning, and the next

month, my class met in the afternoon, because I also supervised.
I would supervise in the morning and teach in the afternoon, or

around within my district, and supervised teachers.

I went

This I did for

five years.

I was in Washington public schools just nine years

altogether.

When I finished my A.B. degree at George Washington, I

went to Columbia University to study for my doctorate.

I never

went back to the Washington public schools.
Davis:

Was the system of model teacher and demonstrating more or less
the origins of the student teacher system--[that is] when a teacher
does their credential work for their M.A., and then they go out and
teach in the field, become student teachers in the classroom, with
another teacher?

Stolz:

The program of the model teacher for demonstration and supervision had nothing to do with the program in normal school.

I don't know
It was a

Although there

were supervisors who went from the central office, the model teacher
program gave you a much more intimate feeling, because you worked
with teachers who were in the same district in which you were teaching.

8

Stolz:

They could observe you, and you could talk back and forth about it.
They could ask you questions about what you were doing.

Usually

when I taught, there would be at least three or four, sometimes
more teachers sitting at the back of the room.

This kept you on

your toes, (laughter)
Davis:

That's right!

But it also probably provided a bit of input

and dialogue, their point of view, and so forth.
Stolz:

Oh yes.

There was another person who influenced me, and probably

is why I went to Columbia for my Ph.D.
woman four years older than I was.

It was Ethel Summy, a

gone to normal school, and then to George Washington for her A.B.
She had gone to Columbia University to observe in the Horace Mann
School and Lincoln School.
programs for children.

And she had told me about their outstanding

She also got me interested in the progressive

education movement, and I joined the society.

The headquarters of

the Progressive Education Association was in Washington at that
time.

Miss Summy taught in the summertime at the University of Virginia;

they had a summer school that ran nine weeks, a full quarter.

And

even before I had finished my A.B. degree, she got me a position
there.

So, I taught at the University of Virginia, and that's where

I saved my money to go to Columbia.

I taught I think seven summer

quarters at the University of Virginia; while I was studying at
Columbia, I would teach in the summer.
Davis:

How did that progressive movement differ in their philosophy
from, say, the regular school system in Washington?

Stolz:

Oh my, very different.
what schools were like.

You see, you're too young to realize

I had 60 children when I first started

to read.

And you were supposed to teach them all

And they all sat at little desks in chairs, which were

nailed down.
Davis:

Yes. I grew up in a classroom like that.

Stolz:

Did you?

And, when they got ready to go out to recess, you

would say, "Sit," then everybody would sit up straight as a ramrod.
Then you would say, "One," and they'd put one foot in the aisle; "Two,"
they stood up; "Three," they turned; and "Four," they marched out into
the cloakroom.

They'd get their things, and then get in line in

the cloakroom, and march out through the school.

Usually, the

principal of the school was out in the main hallway, watching all
these children come out of the various rooms.

They couldn't look

right or left until they got out of the door into the playground.
Now, I don't mean to imply that schools, certainly in my classes,
were unpleasant places for children, because I liked children, and
I liked to teach, there was no question about that.
certainly were repressive.

But, they

Children were allowed no initiative,

there was no talking in the classroom.

If a child whispered to

another, you just gave them a look, or you went and touched their
shoulders, because they knew in school you don't whisper, and you
don't talk to anyone.

It was very regimented.

I'm sure if we'd

had tape recorders in those days, it would have been ninety-nine
and forty-four one hundreths percent the teacher's voice, and the
rest the children's.

About the only time that children had a chance

to talk was if they asked a question, and they had to raise their
hand first, and be recognized, and then they could talk.
they had oral reading.

Or, when

Davis:

Very much the British system, essentially.

Don't you think

that's very much the outgrowth of the British system, our
colonial inheritance, so to speak?
Stolz:

Well, I don't know, I don't think I could answer that question,
because I didn't see British schools in those days, and I don't
know how long it was before they loosened up; they were much slower
than we were, I know that.

But whether we got it from them, or

whether that's what education was all about, I don't know.

So

what was going on at Horace Mann School in those days, and what I
saw there in terms of children's activities changed entirely the
way I taught.

In those days, oranges were shipped in boxes, wooden

boxes, which had a division in the middle.
feet high, a foot deep, and a foot wide.

They were about three
I got my grandfather to

put another shelf in each one of them to make a bookcase.

At

that time, in the classroom, every child read from the same text
book.

You had a text book, which was adopted and provided by the

schools.

No matter on what level a child was able to read, in the

first grade, everybody read the same book.

In the second grade,

everybody read the second grade book, and so forth.

One of the

first things I did, I wrote to various publishers, and told them
that I was a demonstration teacher in Washington, and asked them
to send me a complete set of their readers.

You see, the readers

went from pre-primers through primers, and on up through the eighth
grade.

I got those from several publishing companies, so I started

a library for children, with these orange crates.

And then I

borrowed from the kindergarten teacher some chairs. I fixed a little

11

circle in the back of the room with this library and when a child
had finished his seat work--when you were teaching one group, the
other group did seat work--he could go back and read in any book
which he wanted.

And I had--I don't know, is this the kind of thing

you want?
This is fascinating, yes!
I had an interesting child in that group.
because I've used him as an example.
[from an] Italian background.

I remember him

His name was Tony, he was

His father was a huckster.

That meant

that he had a truck with vegetables, and would go around the streets
with his horse and sell vegetables house to house to people.

In

those days, we had a system in the public schools that required if
a child didn't learn to read in the first grade, he/she stayed on
another year.
I see, you didn't get promoted, yes.
You didn't get promoted, but if you stayed on, you only stayed
three years.

If you hadn't learned to read at the end of three

years you were promoted on what we called "longevity".

(laughter)

You had three years to learn to read, and then you'd get promoted on
longevity.

And Tony came to me on three years of longevity from

the first grade to the second grade.

I knew he couldn't read, I

was told by the first grade teacher that he couldn't read, and I
hadn't really done very much with him, until I got this library.
He picked up a pre-primer back there, and all of a sudden, at the top
of his lungs, he began reading. "THE BOY," he began, shouting it out.
Now, many teachers would have said, "Tony, you're not supposed to

12

Stolz:

read out loud," but I didn't.
you can read, can't you?"

I went back, and said to him, "Tony,

And he said, "Yes."

in an Italian family, and they spoke Italian.

You see, he lived
I found out that he

could read in a pre-primer, not every word, but a great deal of it,
if he was allowed to read out loud.

So what I did was, I got a little

table that was down in our cellar at home, and brought that to
school, and I set two of the kindergarten chairs in the cloakroom,
so Tony could go there and do his reading, and shout it out, and
not bother other people.

And then I picked out a little girl, who

was reading at about the sixth or seventh grade level, and I had
her sit out there with him, with the understanding that she would
sit there and read silently in her own book, and if Tony wanted a
word, he'd ask her.
her.

But she was not to help him if he didn't ask

This worked very well.

So I had a tutor for Tony, and he

didn't annoy the other children.

And I want you to know that by

I

the end of that year, he went to the third grade reading in third
grade books.

And I've been very proud of this.

Davis:

Absolutely.

Stolz:

This is the kind of thing that began developing.

I did where Tony came in was to build a doll house with orange crates,

It was an idea I had

of the tools.

I put Tony in charge

One of the things I wanted to do for him was build up

his self esteem, because he had this silly grin on his face all of
the time, just because he was so embarrassed.
that makes teachers very uncomfortable.

It's the kind of grin

13

Davis:

Well, I mean, you really responded to him as an individual,
that's what happened.

Nobody had done that before, seen what

he had to offer.
Stolz:

That's right, and when I set him up in the cloak room, I didn't
do this for punishment, and I explained to the children that Tony
could speak Italian and we couldn't any of us speak Italian.

I'd

get him to talk, say some Italian, and then they'd look at him, you
know, in great admiration.

And then, I said, "And that's the reason

he's behind you in reading, but we're going to help him to catch
up."

When I put him in charge of the tools, he had great prestige.

If a child wanted a hammer, he had to ask Tony, and had to return
it to him, to be put on a shelf where he kept the tools.
Davis:

Yes.

I can see the beginnings of your interest in psychology

and early development emerging from your experiences as a teacher
at this stage.
Stolz:

Yes.

Well, you were asking me about progressive education, you

see, this is the way it began to influence me.

We had a system in

the Washington public schools that had divisions.
were five divisions.

I think there

I remember I was in Division Five, and there

was an administrator in charge of each division, who was under the
superintendent, and he did the administrative work.
my boss.

He really was

He'd also been the administrator when I had been a child

in the schools.

When I got my first position in his division, he

was just delighted, because he thought the reason I was so smart
was because I'd gone to school in his division, of course.

He was

very proud of me, and he would come every once in a while, maybe

14

Stolz:

once a month to visit my class.

I can remember one day he stopped

in, and I had that day about seven or eight teachers sitting in the
back, and no more chairs, and so he just stood there for a while,
and then just as he was leaving, he spoke to me.

I was teaching

a class, and the brighter children were free at that time, so a
good many of them were moving around, some of them were working on
the doll house, and some of them were sitting reading.

I remember,

he came up and whispered to me, and said, "The little girl in the
first row is whispering."

You see, he was telling me this to

protect my reputation before the visitors.

And I said to him, "Thank

you so much, I gave her permission to do it."

(laughter)

Davis:

You were a great cover for her.

Stolz:

Well, you know, she was allowed to by this time.

Davis:

Because your classroom had changed, yes.

Stolz:

If she had something she wanted to talk to somebody about, or
ask them something, why, she was allowed to.

But, you see, he had

accepted the new movement, and he wanted me to be perfect.

Well,

before I left, I got him to take out half the desks and chairs.
Davis:

That's quite an accomplishment!

Stolz:

That was quite an accomplishment, and they were moved out so
that we had much more freedom.

Well, as I said before, it was through

the Progressive Education Association membership, and going to those
meetings--this was before the journal came out, it didn't come out
until the middle twenties—and visiting the Horace Mann School that
was part of Teachers College, Columbia University.
demonstration and experimental school.

It was their

And it was really through

15

Stolz:

observing there and then observing Ethel Summy and her work, which
she was doing with third and fourth grades that started me.

Davis:

Going back to graduate school?

Stolz:

Yes.

Davis:

Do you think there was a significant number of teachers at that
time that were being affected by the progressive movement [in education]
or would you say it was still quite small?

Stolz:

You mean in Washington, or in the United States?

Davis:

Well, are you prepared to comment on either one?

Stolz:

Well, I think that it was a relatively small movement, mainly
in private schools that had been established by well-to-do parents
who didn't like what was going on in the public schools, who were
influenced by John Dewey's philosophy.
weren't satisfied, and wanted new ideas.

The teachers were those who
There were schools all

over the United States, some in the South, one in San Diego, in
San Francisco, in Detroit; all over the United States there were
individual, mainly private schools.

Now, there were very few public

schools at this time that were doing any experimental work.

I'm

not sure of the facts of this, my memory is that the first public
school that tried to experiment was in Winetka, Illinois, outside
of Chicago.

That was one of the first public school systems [to be

experimental], and Carlton Washburn was the superintendent at that
time.

That was one of the places that later on, in the late twenties,

or middle twenties I guess it was, became the first public school
to have a nursery school.

The Progressive Education Association

was mostly made up of people who were in private schools, such as

16

Stolz:

Stanwood Cobb, who had a school, Chevy Chase Country Day School, in
Baltimore, and he was the first president of the association.

There

were never any problems between teachers and parents, because the
parents who were on the board were very active, not only just
raising funds, but in stating what they wanted, and discussing issues.
At that time, it was a new movement, and included a somewhat select
group.
Davis:

It did not begin to expand until the thirties.

Good, okay, well let's go on, then.

You finally, I guess, moved

from Washington.
Stolz:

Yes.

When I first went to Teachers College, I expected to get

my master's degree.

I remember when my father put me on the train,

I said to him, "Now, I hope you won't worry if I don't get a
master's, because I don't know whether I'm qualified to get a master's
degree, but I'll have a year to study."

One of the things that

precipitated my leaving at that time was that my brother died that
S
summer while I was at the University of Virginia, and we had been
very close.

My father said to me, because I was so upset about

this, "Maybe this is a good year for you to go to New York, you
always said you'd like to study there."
it, and went.

Then I began thinking about

I'd just finished my A.B., and so I was qualified

to go for graduate work.

Teachers College, Columbia University '

was quite outstanding in those days, it was one of the few places
in education that had professors whose names we know today.

I

studied with John Dewey, Kilpatrick, Thorndike, and with Woodworth.
I studied with all these top people.

I was kind of lucky in a way;

I planned to major in educational sociology, because I'd become interested

17

Stolz:

at George Washington University.

The head of educational sociology

at Teachers College at that time was the father of Pat Sears, who's ah. . .
Davis:

Who's here at Stanford.

Stolz:

David Snedden had been a professor at Stanford, but he was now
at Teachers College, and he became my advisor.
was another good influence.

David Snedden

He thought it was silly for women to

go on and take graduate degrees, so he didn't care what I took.

He

let me choose my own curriculum, and what I did was to choose classes
with people whose books I had been using.
Davis:

He didn't realize he was doing you a great favor.

Stolz:

And, so that's how I had this array of marvelous people.

Monroe

had written the only history of education, and I took a course from
Monroe.

Many people whose books I had read, I took work with, and

it was marvelous.
Davis:

Certainly a concentration at Columbia, the right people and. . .

Stolz:

At Teachers College, you were allowed to take classes in the
psychology department at Columbia, .and I worked with Harry Ho1lingsworth, and took the major course with Woodworth.
first year, I got my master's.

At the end of that

I went in the summers to teach at

the University of Virginia, and while I was down there, I decided
I wouldn't go back.

I ought to say this, that same spring, when

I received the M.A. degree, I was awarded a scholarship of $450 to
go on for a Ph.D.
Davis:

That was what, just in the mid 1920Ts?

Stolz:

Yes, that's right, you see, it was 19. . .

Davis:

pre-depression?

18

Stolz:

Nineteen, let's see, I went to Columbia in '21, so this was
the spring of 1922, that I was awarded this scholarship.

When I

was teaching at the University of Virginia, I got to thinking about
it, and I felt I really just couldn't make it, that it was too hard
financially.

I was very independent, and I was doing graduate

study irrespective of my father; I wanted to finance myself.

My

grandfather would send me checks every once in a while, but nothing
I ever asked for.

So I had decided I wouldn't go back to Columbia.

During that summer, Mabel Carney, who was a professor at Teachers
College in the field of rural education came to the University of
Virginia to give some lectures.

She saw me, and said, "We're

looking forward to seeing you next fall."

And I said, "Well, Dr.

Carney, I've just about decided not to come back; I find it too
difficult financially.

Although I might come back in the future, I'm

going to give up my scholarship, and not come back."

What she did

was to go back to Columbia and see Dr. Bagley, who was her boss. Dr.
Bagley was in charge of the Department of Teacher Training.

Later I

got a letter from Dr. Bagley offering me an assistantship for $1500,
and I could keep the scholarship.
Davis:

Both!

Stolz:

So that was, you know, very luxurious in those days.

Davis:

Very handsome, yes.

Stolz:

So, that was why I went back for my Ph.D. at Columbia.
decided to just go back to Washington.

I had

I was on leave from the

Washington public schools, so I could have gone back.

And I think

if the assistantship hadn't happened, I probably would have stayed in

19

Stolz:

Washington and gradually gone up in the school system.

But I went

back to Columbia and it was then that I resigned from the Washington
public schools.

The next year, they gave me the Grace Dodge Fellowship

and I was able to continue, and finish my Ph.D.
Davis:

By this time, was it in education and psychology?

Stolz:

Well, Teachers College was the college of education, but by
this time, I'd gotten very definitely interested in psychology, and
in child psychology.

I must say this for Dr. Bagley, he told me

as soon as I came, "Now I want you to know, you're not to change
your major interest."

And he said, "This doesn't mean you have to

go into the field of teacher training; you can go right on in your
field of child psychology."

I was especially interested in it

because we had a simply terrible professor who taught the course on
child psychology at that time, and she really didn't know anything
about children. .She was just terrible, and I think this stimulated
me to think I'd like to teach child psychology some day.
had access to very good people in the field of psychology.

And we
I

worked with Gates, and with Pintner, as well as the people over at
Columbia, and Leta Hollingsworth.

It was a very strong department

because Thorndike was the head of it, and he was a very strong man, and
very well known.

He influenced me in another way when this conflict

in my social interests and my professional interests was happening.
I remember we had the Psychology Club of graduate students, and we
would invite a professor to come to afternoon tea, and we'd only
invite one at a time.

The day that Thorndike was invited, I

happened to be the social chairman.

Instead of bringing up people

to meet him, I took him around, and introduced him to all the students
I don't remember how many there were, maybe 50, maybe a little more.
When we got through going around the ring, Professor Thomdike looked
at me, and said, "Miss Meek, you will never make a psychologist."
And I nearly died! (laughter)
too social."

As I looked at him, he said, "You're

"Do you know," he said, "that you remembered every

name of all those people?"
Davis

I would think that would be a good sign of a very keen memory,
rather than the opposite.

Stolz

Well, he was really in a way teasing me.
esting thing.

He did another inter-

In my last year, when I was beginning to work on

my dissertation. I made an outline, and I took it to him, to get
his approval to go ahead.

He looked at it--it was on learning of

children, young children--and he said, "You know, we don't have
anybody on this faculty that's interested in this."
he was interested in adult learning.

At this time,

He said, "You know what I

think you ought to do?" The college had just gotten a grant from
the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, which was a preliminary grant
from them to see if they could get colleges and universities to
begin studying children.
Davis:

This was a whole new field, I take it.

Stolz:

At that time, John B. Watson had been put out of Johns
Hopkins, and was working for an advertising company in New York
City.

And Thorndike was very anxious to get him to come back into

psychology.

Watson was very bitter because he was put out of

Johns Hopkins because of an affair he was having with a young girl.

21

Stolz

And, you know, we wouldn't have any college professors if they
did that today!

Davis

Truer words were never spoken.

Stolz

But anyhow, Thomdike had asked Watson if he would undertake
a study of children on this first initial grant.

He had gotten a

younger woman, who was working under Woodworth at Columbia for her
degree, to be his assistant.

That was Mary Cover Jones, who has

been at the University of California, Berkeley, at the Institute
[of Child Welfare, now the Institute of Human Development] for many
years.

She had moved with her husband, Harold Jones, and her baby

girl, to the Hecksher Foundation.

This was a place for children who

were in need of any kind of service.

If the child's mother was ill,

and couldn't take care of him or her, why the child could be left
there while she was in the hospital; and if the parents deserted a
child, until they could get the child into some sort of an institution,
he or she came there.
Davis

WTiere was the Hecksher Foundation?

Stolz

It was in New York City. Mary Jones moved there in order to use
those children (some of whom would be there a year or more) in her
research.

She did a study which is famous even today, on overcoming

fear in a child which was patterned on Watson's technique.
So, Thomdike said, "Why don't you go to see John B. Watson, and
see if you can't do this study over there at Hecksher Foundation?"
He told me about the grant and I hadn't heard about it, of course, as
a student.

So, I went down to see John B. Watson, and was I excited!

Because I not only had used his textbooks, but I was living in
Washington at the time all of the publicity had gone on about his

He was a famous person.

But I had never

and started in on my study.

So, I

I did go to Hecksher Foundation,

When I'd been working in it about a

month, the children got diphtheria, and the place had to be closed,
and I wasn't allowed in.

Now Mary Jones could go on with her

study, because she was living there--in those days, they put up
a purple sign, "diphtheria," on the outside of the building, and
segregated those inside from those outside.

But, you see, I was

just going back and forth certain days, so here I was, with a
dissertation to do, and no access to the children. So I had to change
my location and work with children in the Horace Mann four-year-old
kindergarten.
Davis:

But, you didn't have to give up your original plan?

Stolz:

Well, I revised it, because I had learned a few things in that
month, (laughter)

It wasn't such a brilliant idea that I had at

My first plan had been primarily to study the development

of oral language, but I changed it.

to come back to, because I happen to have a six-year-old now

And we were using phonics, but not as the

And we taught phonics, you know.

It wasn't the primary

technique that was used; it was ah, what did I call it?
Davis:

Supplementary?

Stolz:

Yes.

"See and say," we called it, the visual impression of the

whole word was important.

In my dissertation, I analyzed what cues

children use when they read a word; how do they know this word is
ball?

What are they really looking at?

If they're using those

tall letters, the double Vs

to begin with, and then the word call

is used, they get mixed up.

Later they see something else.

Davis:

The tall thing in the front.

Stolz:

Yes, that's right.

There were three factors in relation to learning

to read that I studied in my dissertation: the similarity of associated
words, the effect of initial practice, and the effect of later
practice.

I selected six words: ball, flag, doll, lion, duck, rose—

all four-letter words that designated objects of interest to children.
For each of these words I selected five other words each of which had
some similarity to it.

For example, with ball, burr has [the] initial

24

Stolz:

letter similar, feel the final letter, sale the middle two letters,
bake the first two, and kill final two.

Each word was put on

top of a little box, with a prize in the box of ball.

As you can

see, such a situation gradually forced the child to use the total
word as his cue, rather than separate parts as the double I at the
end or the tall letter at the beginning, and so forth.
Davis:

And this was really the subject of your dissertation?

Stolz:

Yes, that's what I used for my dissertation.
finished—you want me to go on?

And when I

Is this what you want, this

professional history?
Davis:

Oh yes, definitely.

Stolz:

Well, when I finished my Ph.D.--I'd been teaching summers at
the University of Virginia--it was just the time when the Laura
Spelman Rockefeller Memorial was pouring money into the child
development field.
universities.

They were establishing institutes at various

They gave a big grant to Teachers College, and let's

see, I finished in 1924, that very year they gave it to Teachers College.
One was established at the University of Minnesota, and the one at
the University of Iowa which was already established was augmented by
grants.

Arnold Gesell at Yale was given a large grant, and the institute

at the University of California at Berkeley was started in '26.

This

was the big time of the opening up of the child development field.
Now another thing the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial did was to
give a grant to the American Association of University Women to get
college women to study about their own children.

One of the men who was

an officer at the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial was Lawrence
Frank, who was insistent that this new movement should not be a welfare

25

Stolz:

movement in which educated women improved conditions for poor children
and parents, but that they should improve what they were doing
with their own children.

The grant to the A.A.U.W. was given through

the influence of Mr. Frank and Helen Thompson Wooley, who was an
outstanding woman psychologist, at that time, active in the A.A.U.W.
The woman who directed it for one year was Frances Fenton Bernard,
educational secretary of A.A.U.W. At that time Ada Comstock [who]
was dean of Smith College, was going to Harvard to be president of
Radcliffe College.

Frances Fenton Bernard had been asked to take

the deanship of Smith.
A.A.U.W. was vacant.

So the position of education secretary of
I was one of two women recommended by Teachers

College, Columbia, to be interviewed for this position.

M. Carey

Thomas, president of Bryn Mawr College at the time, was on the
committee to interview candidates.

Miss Comstock, who was just going

to Radcliffe was on it, and Helen Thompson Wooley; it was a very
interesting group of outstanding women in the United States.

I was

offered the position but at the same time, I was offered an assistant
professorship at Teachers College.
to do.

And I had a great struggle what

It was very interesting, I went to Thorndike, and told him

about this.

Certainly, my leanings were to stay at Teachers College;

that seemed just marvelous to be offered a position at the institution
where you had been a student.
Davis:

To go back as a teacher, yes.

Stolz:

X asked Thorndike about it, and he said, "No question. Take
the A.A.U.W. job."

And I said, "Why?"

And he said, "If you stay

here now, the faculty will always think of you as one of their bright
young students."

26

Davis:

Very good advice.

Stolz:

"If you go to Washington and accomplish anything, they can always
bring you back, and you will be brought back with professional status."
The other person who advised me to take it was Professor Kilpatrick.
I talked to him about it, and he thought there was no question.
He was not quite as strong as Thorndike but he thought that it would
be very interesting.

Well, it was interesting in many ways, and

very influential in my life.

In the first place, it was very influen-

tial in my meeting so many of the top women in academic life, whom
I hadn't known in my previous experience at all.

They were academic

women, many of them connected with women's colleges.

I got to know

Mary Woolley, who was the president of Mount Holyoke very well, and
Aurelia Henry Reinhardt, who was the president of Mills College.
Davis:

Are many of these women still alive, for instance Mary Woolley?

Stolz:

Well, let's see, no, Mary Woolley is dead; Aurelia Henry Reinhardt
is dead; Ada Comstock died last year. Frances Fenton Bernard died
quite a while ago.

Most of them are not alive.

Of course, M. Carey

Thomas was quite an elderly woman when I first met her, and Helen
Thompson Woolley died in '47.

The reason I know about these dates,

I've been working on that Radcliffe Encyclopedia of Notable
American Women.

I don't know whether you know about that.

Davis:

You mentioned that to me, yes; we'll have to come back to that.

Stolz:

It was very exciting to have contacts with these very outstanding
people.

And another thing that was very good for me was that I went

all over the United States.

Davis:

This is July 28, 1977, and I am with Dr. Lois Meek Stolz at
her home right near the Stanford campus, and we are about to embark
on our second interview.

I think we left off with the beginnings

of your work with the American Association of University Women.
You were hired to head a project, as I remember, that had to do with
having college women collect material about their own children.
you could start with what you did.

Maybe

That was one of your first

jobs after graduating from Teachers College, Columbia, is that right?
Stolz:

That's right.

It was the first job.

Davis:

Yes, okay, good.

Stolz:

1924.

What year was it again?

Well, one of the things that I think I was saying last

time was that there were certain advantages in this position.

One

was that I had to travel a great deal, and I had never traveled much,
except along the eastern coast of the United States, before.
This gave me a real opportunity to see the United States, and in
those days, you traveled by train, and so you really saw something
of the country.

Then, when I went to the branches of the association,

I usually stayed in the home of one of the members,

That was the

way I guess they saved money, instead of putting me up in a hotel.
And I met some very interesting people there.

One that I remember

vividly was in San Diego, where I stayed in a home.

I don't

remember the name of the woman who entertained me, but her mother
lived with them and her mother had been in the first graduating class
for women at the University of Michigan.
experiences at Michigan.
Davis:

Oh, I would love to hear them.

And she told me about her

28

Stol2:

I probably ought to say here that the University of Michigan
was the first university that accepted women.

Oberlin had accepted

men and women from its beginning in 1833 but it was a college, not
a university.

Well, one of the things the woman in San Diego told

me was that the women students in those days always sat in the back
of the room, that they weren't allowed to ask any questions because
that might disturb the mental activities of the young gentlemen in
the classes.

She told me many details, but then at the end, she said,

"When we graduated, the young men sat on the stage," but the womenthere were three of them--sat down in the audience.

Then she said

that she had just returned from the 50th anniversary of her graduation
and she said, with a twinkle in her eye, "And this time, the
president was my escort, and I sat on the stage, and the young
gentlemen sat in the audience below me." (laughter)
Davis:

That's a nice reversal.

Stolz:

She had a nice sense of humor about this experience.

I had

others, not quite as dramatic as that, but as I went and stayed in
homes of these people, it was very educational for a young woman.
And then the third thing, which probably stood me in good stead
for a long time, was [that] I got to know something about the
educational programs in various parts of the United States.

I would

often be taken to meetings to speak to teachers, or to visit some
project that the A.A.U.W. branch was supporting, like a day nursery,
or a settlement house, or something of this sort.

So that it was

really very educational, and if I look at it in that perspective, I
think I probably learned more than I contributed.

At the end of that

29

Stolz:

five years, just what Thomdike had said, happened.

I was invited

back to Teachers College to be director of the Child Development
Institute and professor of education.
grant for five years.

They had just gotten a renewal

I was there until '38, when I went on sabbatical,

and came out to California in order primarily to see the work that
was being done at the University of California at Berkeley, at
their Institute of Child Welfare Research.

Most of our work at

Columbia had been with young children, pre-school children, because
the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, under the leadership of
Lawrence K. Frank, was very anxious to have studies of children below
school age.

There had been a good many studies of school-aged children,

but not of what we later call pre-school children.

And so, at the

institute, our research was mainly in that field.

However, in our

classes, in our child development major, and other classes which we
gave, we did discuss the developmental level through adolescence.
But our research was mainly with the younger children.

So, I was

rather anxious to see what was going on at Cal, because they were
doing a very special project, that began in 1932.

[It was] a study

of adolescent development of 100 boys and 100 girls that they followed
through that period.

Then while I was here, I married Herbert Stolz,

who had been the head of the institute, and although no longer there
at that time, was still working on some of the data.

Eventually,

I worked on the data that he was concerned with, which had to do with
the somatic development of adolescent boys.
Davis:

So, you were out here for a period of time, then.

Stolz:

I extended my leave of absence for a year, and then decided to

30

Stolz:

stay out here.

Herbert and I considered going back, he was an

M.D., and you know, M.D.'s can always pick up jobs anywhere, but
I began to like California, and see the opportunities out here.
Davis:

So, you thought that you would stay on, and then you would
eventually find a job out here?

Stolz:

Well, I don't think I thought of it in terms of eventually
finding a job, because I never stopped professional activities.
I had, you see, my contact with the Progressive Education Association
which gave me many contacts out here; when people heard I was out
here, I had a great deal of work in lecturing, workshops, and that
type of work.

I was head of a workshop at Mills College for

secondary teachers in the summer of 1938 that the Progressive Education
Association developed under a grant from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller
Memorial.

I was director of the workshop at Claremont College the

next year and I participated in a workshop at Reed College later.
Davis:

Oh, I see.

Well, how did it feel to make a decision to leave

Columbia, which was the one place that you had earlier thought, you
know, that. . .
Stolz:

Well, you see, I had been there ten years on the faculty, and
when you have an administrative position, as I had, you spend an awful
lot of time in committee meetings.

I was on a great many committees;,

on higher education, on the committee concerning the interrelationship
of Columbia and Teachers College, I can't tell you how many
general committees.

.And I really began to wonder what it was all

about, because my experience with administrative committees is that
you work very, very hard, and then the next year or the year after,

31

Stolz:

or two years after, they appoint a new committee, and they just
change everything.

And it isn't anything that has permanence.

also primarily was interested in teaching.

I

I think there's no

question that teaching, and my contacts with students has given
me probably my greatest professional pleasure in life.

Even though

I didn't analyze it then, I see now in retrospect that this has
been a dominant drive for a long, long time.

So, it wasn't so hard.

And at this time, you see, the institute had closed.
Davis:

At Columbia?

Stolz:

At Columbia.

We were in the middle of a depression, and after

that five-year grant, we got a two-year grant in order to integrate
the program into Teachers College.

But everybody at Columbia had

had an across the board decrease in salary, and there wasn't money.
New York was very hard hit with the depression.

Teachers College

didn't have a large endowment, and even what they had wasn't getting
much interest. The institute had closed, and I had been made head
of the Department of Individual Guidance and Child Development that
was established.

But it wasn't really a very integrated program.

So, staying in California wasn't like leaving the institute; that
had already closed, and that made a difference.

And another thing

[was that] before I left Columbia, I had begun to work on a book
for parents, called Your Child1s Development and Guidance.

It was

an illustrated book for parents on development that Lippincott
had asked me to write.

They had published one by Louise Zabriskie,

Mother and Baby Care in Pictures, and they asked me to do one on the
pre-school child.

So I was in the middle of that, which was partly

what I was doing during my sabbatical.

I was also involved in a

32

Stolz:

book for the Progressive Education Association.

Commissions had

been established beginning in the thirties in progressive education,
financed by the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, and later by
the General Education Board, to study children in the secondary schools,
to study curriculum, and to study the relationship of secondary
schools and colleges.

The secondary school curriculum for people

who wanted to go to college in those days was completely dominated
by colleges.

They set up requirements for entrance that became the

curriculum of secondary schools.

These commissions were attempts

to break down that control, and develop curriculum, and programs
much more attuned to adolescent development.

So you see, a new

trend was coming into child development which pushed it to study
the upper levels of children's development.

I was appointed

chairman of a committee to get materials out on the personal,
social development of boys and girls during adolescence, with
implications for secondary education.

This was a cooperative effort,

for which workshop fellows would be appointed, who would work with
me.

These fellows were people who were working in related fields,

in a secondary school.

So I was working on that, and the book was

published in 1940 [Meek, Lois Hayden et al. 1940. The Personal-Social
Development of Boys and Girls, with Implications for Secondary
Education. New York. Progressive Education Association.]
Davis:

Oh, it gave you more time to do your writing, too.

Stolz:

Yes, that's true, and I kept very busy.

At that time, the

University of Chicago had developed a committee on human development
which the Behavioral Science Center at Stanford is patterned after.
It was headed by Daniel Prescott but started by the same man who

33

Stolz:

started the center here, by Ralph Tyler, who was then dean of education at Chicago.

Herbert and I were invited to go there as parti-

cipants.

We couldn't arrange to go for a year, but we went for one

semester.

That was a very stimulating experience for me, because

Fritz Redl and Roger Barker were there, and many other people
who were in the child development field.

That is where I worked

on some of the case studies from the University of California adolescent
study; trying to interrelate data on somatic development with
data on social development to show the interrelationships, and the
effect of one's physical development on one's social, and the effect
of one's social acceptance on one's attitude toward oneself.
asked to do this by Dan Prescott.

I was

I think I did five or six,

which were to be left at the Chicago Institute--and one of them was
published as a chapter in the book Somatic development of Adolescent
Boys, which I called "A Case Study of Ben."
i

That of course was not

his name.
Well, so you see, I had plenty to do, and then the war came.
The governor of California was being besieged by various organizations
in the state that were interested in children because this
horde of people were coming out to the war industries, were living
in trailers, and often children would be locked in the trailers
all day long, or some of them were chained to the outside of a trailer.
The conditions were terrible.
Davis:

So, most of these war industries were set up around California?

Stolz:

Yes.

This is when we became an industrial state; we were an

agricultural state before that.

The shipyards and other related

34

Stolz:

war industries began popping out all over California.
was being done about the children.

And nothing

Various organizations kept

pressing the governor to take some leadership; there were funds
available through the federal government, through an act called the
Lanham Act, which had been kind of skewed around on purpose, in
order that some of it could go into child care programs.
nothing had been done in California.

But

Finally, I guess he was so

besieged that he said, "Well, who could do this?"

My name was

suggested, I think, because I didn't have a full-time job, and
people thought I wasn't doing anything, (laughter) And so I took
on that job as assistant to the governor for the coordination of
the care of children during wartime.

I worked on this for about

18 months, or maybe a little longer, I can't quite remember now.
And it was a very, very, frustrating experience, mainly because of
two things.

One was competition between the Department of Education

and the Department of Social Work in Sacramento.

You remember, we

used to have a saying that, "if better cars are made, Buick will
make them"?

Well, you know, if anything is done for children, Education

will do it, or if anything is done for children, Social Work will
do it.

They were very antagonistic, and competitive, and I really

had a great deal of difficulty.
Davis:

You were caught right in between the two departments.

Stolz:

Well, yes, and I couldn't make much headway.

There was another

department involved, and that was the Department of Health.

But

the woman who was the pediatrician assigned to this was very cooperative,
and she would have cooperated with anybody, if we could just get

35

Stolz:

something going.
history.

Then politics came in.

This is interesting in

Earl Warren was at that time attorney general, and Culbert

Olson was governor.

Warren suddenly decreed that because the word

pre-school or nursery school was not mentioned in the constitution of
the state, the state could not develop nursery schools or ask for
funds from the Lanham Act.

Now this was pure politics, and in the

election which took place the next November, Warren was elected
governor, and Olson was out.

Then Warren immediately asked the

legislature to pass a law that he be allowed to do this, and it was
done.

This was very disturbing to me.

I'm no politician, I'm too

forthright, and say what I think when I think it.

There was one

hopeful thing in that election, because a man by the name of Robert
Kenny was elected attorney general; and although he was a Democrat
and Warren was a Republican, he made up his mind he was not going to
have that fight that had occurred between Olson and Warren, and he
was for getting some things done.

He was very, very helpful to me.

At that time, the legislature was not very progressive, and I
remember I went in to him once with a long list of things that I
thought ought to be done in the legislature to clear some matters,
and I said to him, "Now, who do you think we ought to take this up with?"
I went on, you know, in my great enthusiasm how all of these things
ought to be done for children and he said to me, "Dr. Stolz, did
you ever see a senator?"

I kind of gasped, and said, "No, I

don't believe I ever have."

And he said, "Well, when you go out,

just to the right of the door as you leave my secretary's office,
there's a man sitting in the chair there, waiting to see me.

Now,

36

Stolz:

you look at him, and then you will understand when I tell you that
I don't think there's any hope of getting much of this done."

Well,

I did look at the gentleman, and I agreed with him after I saw
him. (laughter)
things together.

But Kenny was very fine, and we did many interesting
We worked on a series of records that were sent

to radio stations all through the state concerning the fights that
were going on between the rednecks and the blacks, who had
poured in from the South, and were going to bars, and having fights
all the time.

And between the Mexican Americans and the blacks in

the southern part of California, where they were pouring in.
Davis:

What was the record--how did the record handle this?

Stolz:

Well, what we did was to try to analyze why these conflicts
were happening; to explain them, to show what were the difficulties,
and how they'd come about.

Every night, it seemed to me, the

newspapers all over the state were having some big to-do about what
happened in a bar.

Many of these were between soldiers who were on

leave, or in bars near camps where these blacks and Mexicans and
rednecks fron the South were pouring in, and being mixed together
and having their problems.
Kenny was really quite a great man, in my opinion, and a very
fine lawyer, so that I really had some excitement and learned a lot.
We finally decided that the Department of Education would have the
child care centers when Warren made that decision, and this legislation passed.

And the funds were requested from the Lanham Act.

Just about that time I got a telephone call from Washington, D.C.
from what was the beginning of what is now HEW. And at that time, a

37

Stolz:

man by the name of Charles Taft, who was the brother of Senator
Taft, was in charge of it.

And this was in the evening at my home,

this phone call.
Davis:

Where were you living then?

Stolz:

Oakland.

Davis:

In Oakland.

Stolz:

No.

So, did you commute to Sacramento, when you were. . .

They gave me an office in San Francisco.

And that's the

reason I had never seen a senator, (laughter) Well, anyhow, this
telephone call came--which I've always thought was very delightful--and
the man on the phone said his name was Edgar Kaiser, and that he was
calling from Washington, D.C.

The name Edgar Kaiser didn't mean

anything to me; I'd heard of Henry J. Kaiser, and I knew he'd established all the shipyards in Richmond, but I'd never heard of Edgar
Kaiser.

He began telling me that they were going to have child

care centers in two shipyards in Portland, Oregon, where he was director.
S
And they were so grandiose, the things he said over the phone, I
decided that this was one of my friends who had known how frustrated
I'd been in the state, and was teasing me.

So, I really stopped

listening to what he said, and began thinking, "Now, whose voice
is it?"

But, he kept on and on, and kept saying he wanted me to

come up to Portland to talk about it, and I hardly could remember
what he'd said, except that it was very grand, and he kept pressing
me to come to Portland to consult with him about this.

I finally

turned to my husband, who was sitting there in the study reading,
and I said to him, "Herbert, this man wants me to come up to Portland
to talk about some child care centers."

And Herbert said, "Well, I

38

Stolz:

don't see any reason why you shouldn't go up to Portland for a couple
of days and consult with him."
I said yes, I would come.

Finally, with that little push,

And he said, "Well, when can you get there?"

I said, "Well, what about two weeks from Monday?"

And he said,

"Oh, I'm leaving here tonight, and I expect to be in Portland by
Monday morning, and I thought maybe you could come then."
said, "Mr. Kaiser, there's a war on." (laughter)
the most marvelous remark of the century.

Then I

I think that's

There he was engaged in

nothing but war work, and I said, "I can't get reservations by Monday
to fly up there."

And he said, "Dr. Stolz, if you will come on

I began to find out how business works--you know, I was very naive--and
the way things are done.

of the most interesting things that ever happened to me.
Davis:

Well, by all means, take as much time as you need.

Do you

(Tape stops and then resumes.)

We just stopped to look at some very elegant albums documenting
pictorially the childcare service centers at Kaiser shipbuilding
yards in Portland, Oregon.

Dr. Stolz felt that that might give me a

little background pictorially.

Unfortunately, we don't have a videotape,

but why don't you continue with your oral history?
Stolz:

Well, I think I ought to go back.

Mr. Kaiser realized after

the shipyards were in operation how much absenteeism there was among

39

Stolz:

women because of their childcare problems.

Most of the women who

used to take care of children in their homes now could get jobs in
the shipyards, which was much more to their advantage, economically,
as they got better wages.

So there were very few women who were

willing to do child care during the day in their own homes, or
in another person's home.
to the shipyard workers.

Portland, at that time, was very antagonistic
Portland was a very conservative town,

and here this horde of people, mainly from the southeastern part
of the United States had come in, and this was changing this middle
class town.

The people in Portland didn't approve of the newcomers;

they didn't like them, and they did nothing to accommodate them.
The stores didn't change their hours, the health department didn't
change their hours, they just went on as if everybody was a homemaker,
and that there wasn't any such thing as the war or the shipyards.
Davis:

Where did the incoming people live, on the whole?

Stolz:

They had put up temporary dormitories on the shipyard grounds.

Davis:

For families?

Stolz:

Well, first for the workers, they brought the workers in first,
and then the families came in.

Later, a whole new town was built

called VanPort, near Vancouver, Washington, where there was a
third shipyard under Kaiser.

That is where the housing unit was

established for families, for the most part.

Mr. Kaiser had called

a meeting of social workers and educators in the town to ask them
if they would establish child care centers, because he was having
such a problem with absenteeism.
at the shipyards.

He suggested they might be established

The social workers were very hard on him.

They

40

said this was just like the 1870' s, when industry was exploiting women
and children and that for industry to have child care centers would
be simply terrible, and that this whole business should not be. Mr.
Kaiser got very disturbed about this, and he made up his mind
he was going to get child care centers somehow.

So he went to

Washington, and saw Mrs. Roosevelt, and asked her if she would
ask Admiral Land, who was in charge of the shipyards during the war,
to allow the Kaisers to build a child care center and charge it
to their overhead.

All of the war industries had a limitation, they

could only make six percent profit, and what theyxcould charge to
their expenses, had to be okayed by the federal government.

Well,

Mrs. Roosevelt became very excited about the possibility, and she
did talk to Admiral Land, and he did approve it,
Kaiser about her experiences in England.

She also told Mr.

Probably you don't remember

but during the war, Mrs. Roosevelt went to England during the Blitz,
and saw what was going on.

She told Mr. Kaiser about the take-home

food, which was provided at the factories where women worked.

Women

could pick up their pre-cooked dinners when they left the factory.
Thus, they didn't have to go home and cook or market [for] the food
for their dinner.

Mrs. Roosevelt thought it was a marvelous idea, and

she told Mr. Kaiser he ought to try that at his child care center.
That was one of the things he said to me on the telephone which
I thought was so grandiose, it couldn't possibly happen.

When I went

to Portland, the child care center buildings were already under way;
the foundation and the uprights were in, and things were going along.
I had a chance to go over the plans with Mr. Wolff and to make certain

41

changes.

One of the reasons why it's very difficult for women to

work who have pre-school children is that sometimes the children
get sick.

The policy in the child development movement had been

that if a child comes to school with a runny nose, he is not accepted
but must return home with his mother.

This made difficulties when

women had a war industry job, for them to have to go home with a
slightly sick child.

I suggested to Mr. Wolff that we try to find

a way that we could build what I called an infirmary, where children
with slight illnesses could be isolated from the other children.

There

they could be diagnosed, and if they were extremely ill, they
could be taken to a hospital.
job during that day.

Some of the children could stay overnight,

if this seemed a good idea.
authorities.

Thus the mother could go on with her

We had to take this up with the medical

The Kaisers have had a policy for years when they've

built dams to have hospitals for their workers, because they were
isolated.

They had a medical program at every one of the yards,

and a hospital had already been built.

I asked the physician in

charge, Dr. Forrest Riecke, about an infirmary.
a good idea.

He thought it was

He cooperated beautifully with us on the whole program,

which developed, as I'll tell you, greatly after we got started.
Well, that was one of the first things that was very exciting
to see, that some of these ideas that I'd had for a long time were
now getting incorporated.

Mr. Kaiser was enthusiastic, and I got

so enthusiastic about all the possibilities.

I heard in detail about

this take-home food. I also realized that we had to run the center
24 hours a day, because the women were on three shifts, which was

42

something new.

All these things were exciting to me, new and

challenging things to be done, and I said to Mr. Kaiser, "I just
wish that I could be up here, but I can't."

And he said, "Why not?"

And I said, "Well, my husband's in Oakland, and I can't do this."
He said, "Well, what does your husband do?"

I said he was an M.D.,

and he said, "Well, tell him to come up here, we'll give him a
job at the hospital."
to do that, of course.

(laughter)

But my husband would not want

Finally, Mr. Kaiser said, "Do you know anybody

you could bring here who would be here all the time, and you could
come up on Monday and go home on Friday?"

I had had a letter just

the day before I went up to Kaiser's from James Hymes, who had been
at the institute at Teachers College, and had been my assistant
there when he was doing graduate work.

He was a graduate of Harvard.

He was in the War Department, and he wrote that all he was doing
was writing memoranda that nobody paid any attention to.

He said,

"If you hear of anything interesting relating to the war, let
me know about it."

I hadn't answered his letter, and since they

had recently moved to Washington, I didn't know his address.

I said,

"When I go back, I'll get in touch with Jimmy Hymes." I said, "There's
one problem, he's in the War Department, and I don't know whether
he can be released."

And Mr. Kaiser said, "I can get anybody

released that you want to get."

Then he added, "WTiere does he live?"

And I said, "I really don't know, I'll have to wait till I go home
and look it up."

And he said, "Well, let's see if we can't find him,

you said in the War Department? What place?"

And I said, "I haven't

So, he called in his secretary, and said,"We want to talk

will

By this time, it was in the afternoon in Portland,

it meant that the 5:00 time for closing offices in Washington was
over.

Well, I want you to know% in about 15 to 20 minutes, maybe

25, the secretary said, "Mrs. Hymes is on the phone."

They had not

only found out where he lives, and so forth--this shows you how
business can be run, and it was very new to me.

Mrs. Hymes answered

the phone (Lucia had been my secretary at Columbia) and I said to
her, "Lucia, I want to talk to Jimmy."

And she said, "He's in the

shower, he can't come to the phone. What do you want?" I said, "Well,
I can't talk to you about it, I'm up in Portland, Oregon, and a
position may be opening up, and I want to talk—" And she said, "Tell
me about it, and I'll tell him."
said, "Oh, we'll come."

So I told her in general, and she

I told her, "Tell him when he comes out

of the shower to call this number."
Davis:

(Laughter)

Oh, my god!

He must have just stepped from the

shower, and taken it.
Stolz:

I want you to know that three days after that, he arrived,
having stopped in Chicago and St. Louis, and gotten various materials
that we were going to need.

You see, we had to furnish those

two buildings and to furnish rather large buildings was quite a job.
We had two of them to do.

We did not build a center at the third

shipyard, because in Vancouver, they had a very good child care
program in the community.

We just built centers for the two shipyards

that were in Portland, Swan Island and Oregonship.

James Hymes became

the manager of the Child Service Department, and I was director, later

Stolz:

consulting director.

After the buildings were completed, we had

to get staff for the centers.
my national contacts;

This was one of the advantages of

I knew many people all over the United States.

We did long distance telephoning, and sent telegrams, two-page
telegrams telling about this marvelous undertaking.

When we opened,

about four fifths of our staff were trained nursery school people.
Davis:

From all over the country?

Stolz:

All over the country.

Davis:

That you hired through telegrams.

Stolz:

Well, we got recommendations, and their credentials, and some of
them we knew.

For instance, we had to get a top nutritionist,

because we were going to feed all these hundreds of children.

So,

I called Dr. Elda Robb, who had been the head nutritionist at
the Child Development Institute.

She was in Boston at this time,

and I asked her if she would come.
•' i

She was very excited, but

she said, "Well, I'll have to have 24 hours, I don't know whether
I can get out of what I'm doing here."

So the next day, she called

and said that she could not come because she was in the midst of
working out relations between Simmons College and Harvard.

She

feared it might all fall through if she left, because she was sort
of the key person.

I said, "Okay, you'll have to tell me who I

can get then, because I just don't know nutritionists."
I've been thinking about that.

She said, "Well,

There's a woman, Dr. Miriam Lowenberg,

who had been at the U.S. Children's Bureau.

She recently left there,

and is on vacation with her sister, somewhere in Kansas," and she
told us the town in Kansas.

Again, it was one of those funny things.

45

Stolz:

Her sister didn't have a telephone.

The secretary got the general

store in this little country town in Kansas, and they sent for her.
She came and talked to me on the phone, and we got her on our staff.
She did a magnificent job of recruiting her staff, because we had
to have a supervisor at each center, in addition to Dr. Lowenberg,
and then all of the kitchen workers.
Now, another problem developed.

We found out when we were

beginning to register the children that they had to have certain
immunizations.

The clinics of the health department in Portland

opened something like quarter of ten in the morning, and closed at
three-thirty in the afternoon.

Well, for women who were on the day

shift at the shipyards, this was not good, and the main number of our
women worked during the day.

The physician at the head of the clinics

in Portland was very antagonistic to the shipyard centers.

He used

to come to the centers and pick up some milk that was left over and
go back to the kitchen, and say, "What are you going to do with
that?"

And Dr. Lowenberg would say, "We put it in the refrigerator,

and we use it only for cooking."

But he seemed to be always trying

to catch us doing something wrong in the health area.

And he

would not change clinic hours for immunization of children at the
centers.

So, we talked it over with Dr. Riecke, and he said, "Let's

do our own immunization."

We gave 3606 immunizations and Schick

tests altogether, during the first year.
Davis:

I was going to ask you, about how many children were you handling,
say. . . ?

Stolz:

Well, it varied at different times.

Each center was organized

46

to handle 375 children on each shift.

We never had that maximum.

There were three shifts: day, swing and graveyard.

We didn't have

many children on graveyard shift; and fewer children on swing shift
than we had expected.

We thought that would be a very popular

shift, but it wasn't.

It was the day shift that was the main one.

You saw a picture of the children receiving immunization shots.
And when a child was immunized, the teacher went with the child to
the infirmary in the place of the mother, because the teacher was
the one the child knew best.

She took him, and stayed with him.

The social worker was also there, and the nurse, and the doctor.
The child wasn't just sent to the doctor, and taken there and dropped.
He was given the kind of support that a child gets from his mother.
The take-home food was not started until about three or four
months after we opened but it was very successful, as you saw from
those pictures.

The food was only partially cooked, so that when

it was warmed up, it didn't become just slop.

In each package,

there were directions by the nutritionist telling how to warm it,
and what to serve with it, and so forth.
program.

That was a very successful

At one time, Mr. Kaiser thought it would be a good idea

to do that for all of the women, whether they had children in the
child service center or not.

But we never got that worked out.

You notice we called it not "child care,"

but "child service center,"

and that was because we were doing so much more than just care.
You see, if a child was taken really ill, we got in touch with the
mother by sending someone to the yard
to the hospital.

and a nurse took that child

By this time, the Kaisers had some authority in

47

Stolz:

the community, and we could always get a bed for the child.
this didn't happen every day, but there were occasions.

Now,

Another

thing we did was to set up a little shopping center to make shopping
easier for busy mothers.

We also brought a woman there to do mending,

so that she was available for mothers.
Davis:

Oh, so it was really a service center, in a holistic sense.

Stolz:

Yes, we really were trying to say, "What are the services that
we could offer here that would make it easier for the women to do
their job for the war?"

That was our primary concern.

And the

infirmary, of course, was staffed by trained nurses, but we also
put a teacher in the infirmary, who began to develop special kinds
of little playthings that children could have in their cribs.

And

we also developed different areas for isolation of children who
were more seriously ill.
Davis:

Did you have mainly female teachers, or were there male
teachers as well?

Stolz:

We didn't have any male teachers.

You see, during the w a r —

Davis:

Everyone was [enlisted], that's right.

Stolz:

It might have qualified for war work, but I doubt it.

Davis:

Did you ever see, at any point, a chance of this philosophy
that you brought to the whole structure of the child service centers
being carried over at all into a non-war society, where women would
want to work, and want to have families?

Stolz:

Well, when we closed the centers, Mr. Kaiser didn't know exactly
what the Kaiser Company was going to do after the war.

But he said,

"Whatever I do, whatever the company goes into, I'm going to have a
child care center."

But he never did.

48

Davis

He didn't?

Stolz

No, there's never been one in connection with Kaiser.

One

of the things that I was always sorry about was that the war ended
a little too soon to suit me.
Davis

You must have been just so involved in ah. . .

Stolz

No, we had plans for something very exciting.

You see, when

we first started the centers, social workers in general were very
much against any child under three being in group care.

Well, we

began to find out that many of these women in the shipyards had
younger children.

They became pregnant, their husbands left for

war, and then they wanted to get jobs when their babies were b o m .
Now they had infants and toddlers.

And as you saw in those pictures,

we gradually lowered the age level.
half, then we lowered it to two.

We lowered it to two and a

We have a very interesting pamphlet

which we got out about two-year-old children in groups.
I showed you included children 18 months old.

The pictures

We developed different

programs for these younger children, and we had a much higher
percentage of teachers per child in these groups.

We thought we might

publish later a pamphlet on the program for 18-month-old children-it can be done well if you know about children, and if you have
the money to do it.
Davis:

So, your personal feeling is that you would feel comfortable
about having children—

Stolz

Well, let me tell you the rest of this.

We had plans for taking

over one of the dormitories, and have it arranged for the care of
mothers with infants.

The mothers would live in the dormitory, have

49

Stolz:

little apartments or units.

On the first floor would be the nursery,

which would be staffed by trained nurses, and trained teachers, who
knew about infants.

The infant would be there during [his] mother's

working period, and then at night, mothers could have their babies
in their own room with them, if they wanted.

Or if the child

was sick, or the mother was sick, they could stay in the nursery
during the night.

If she was nursing her baby, she could have

certain times released from the shipyard to come and nurse her baby.
We had our plans all worked out and approved, and they were going
into operation that fall of 1945.

That's the reason I say, with a

little twinkle in my eye, that I'm sorry the war ended.

Because

I would have loved to have had a year, at least, of experimenting
with t h a t —
Davis:

With that idea would have been a sense that it would be much
less disruptive for a mother to have to think about taking her child
i

at that age out of this atmosphere, and into a different atmosphere-that it became very much kind of unified in that the child was in
the same place, and the mother went, came and went.
Stolz:

I don't quite get your point.

Davis:

Well, just that, well, I think about my friends who are working
now, say professors on campus who might use such facilities.

Stolz:

This plan sort of integrated the family, the way wealthy people
used to be able to have a nursery, with a nurse in it.

They saw the

baby for part of the time, and then the nurse took the baby away,
to care for it.

It would be that kind of service on a larger scale,

with many different mothers in it.

I think my theory, and [James]

50

Stolz:

Hymes' theory, was that our responsibility was to meet the needs
of these families.

Not to set up any criterion that we won't take

children under a certain age.

As we found out that the children

of the shipyard mothers were younger and younger, and that the requests
we got were now coming from mothers of infants, this stimulated
us to make that plan.

If we'd been smart, we would have done that

planning ahead, and had the facility opened, because that last year,
we certainly had plenty of demands for it.
got us to thinking about it.

Actually, that is what

But it takes a long time to get things

planned, and something like that had never been done--has never
been done.
Davis:

I was just going to say, do you see any hope at all of this
being done in this country on a large scale?

Stolz:

I don't know.

We did have some plans to have a child care

center set up for the women who are in [the] medical school at Stanford,
both staff and professors.

Dr. Barbara Arons, a psychiatrist,

who was particularly interested in this, talked to me and to James Hymes
about the possibilities.

Soon after this she left Stanford, and so

nothing's happened about it.

But, it's a possibility, and maybe

someday something like this will get worked out.
Davis •

Were you ever asked to write up some kind of model reports on
what you did at Kaiser?

Stolz:

We made annual reports, giving all the figures, the costs,
contributions from the parents, and so forth, and describing the
program.

Davis:

So, it's all been fairly well documented?

51

Stolz:

Yes

So

we h

ave a great deal of data, and I think I told

you that [James] Hymes and I did for Childhood Resources a tape on
the Kaiser centers, which includes a good deal of our data.
Davis:

And where would those tapes be stored?

Stolz:

Well, they're not stored, they're for sale, from Childhood Resources.
[James] Hymes did a series of interviews on historical innovations
in childhood care and education, and that was one in that series.
(Available now in paperback from Hacienda Press; Carmel, California.)

Davis:

Where is [James] Hymes now?

Stolz:

He's in Carmel; he retired early from the University of Maryland,
and is writing, lecturing, and leading workshops for teachers.

Davis:

On the subject of child service, in that area?

Stolz:

Yes.

He is especially interested in early childhood development

and education.

I think it is interesting that after the centers

were well operating, Mr. Kaiser wanted to have a portfolio made to
give to Mrs. Roosevelt.

It was only when any problem arose that I went

Several did, so sometimes Mr. Kaiser came down here to see

me about certain matters.

One of the interesting things about this

set-up was that we operated directly under Mr. Kaiser, not under
the heads of the yards.

Each yard had its own manager.

Mr. Kaiser

was head of the three yards, and we operated directly under Mr. Kaiser.
Davis:

It must have been his own baby.

Stolz:

This had great advantages, because Mr. Kasier had a real
feeling and understanding of the importance of education, and of
what I would call professional standards in the field of child development.

He supported those, and we quite often—not quite often--

but we sometimes had difficulty with yard people, who wanted to do
things that were much more like business, and Mr. Kaiser would always

53

Stolz:

support the professional aspect.

We had an interesting problem

along that line, which shows the kind of administrator Edgar Kaiser
was, the best administrator I've ever worked under in my long career.
At one of the centers, the yard man and the yard manager
wanted to get hold of the administration.

They drew up a plan by

which the two centers would be separated, and they would run their
own center.

Mr. Kaiser gave his approval.

When [James] Hymes

told me by telephone, I immediately wrote Mr. Kaiser that I
disapproved of the plan and therefore submitted my resignation.
In a few days, Mr. Kaiser called me from San Francisco, asking me
to have lunch with him.
insisted.

I reminded him of my resignation but he

At luncheon he asked me to tell him why I disapproved.

I listed the diffuculties that would arise in the nutrition program,
health supervision, freedom in allocating staff, and other areas.
When I finished he asked me to come to Portland for a meeting.

that meeting of yard and center administrators, he told them he had
changed his mind about separation of the centers, giving his reasons.
He took full responsibility—never asking me to present my views.
Very few administrators would have done this.

Davis:

This is July 29, 1977, and we are at the home of Dr. Lois
Stolz for a third interview.

Last time, we finished up Dr. Stolzfs

involvement as director of the Child Service Centers at Kaiser
shipbuilding yards in the 1940's in Portland, Oregon.

And we are

now moving into the Stanford years, and Dr. Stolz is going to talk
today about her involvement and her coming to Stanford, the beginning
of her career at Stanford University.

Go right ahead, Dr. Stolz.

54

Stolz:

Well

know

>

> I really came to Stanford on a fluke.

When

we were in Chicago, I think I told you, at that time, we got to
know Roger Barker and his wife very well, and became very fond of
them.

And he was at that time on the staff at Stanford, I think

as assistant professor.

He sort of felt he was at a dead end.

He

had an offer at another university for the summer, and they had
an opening there in the winter, and he thought if he could go up
there in the summer, it would give him an opportunity to kind of feel
out the place, and see if that was where he wanted to go.

But Stanford

would not release him because it was during the war, and difficult
to find a replacement.

They said that if he could find someone

qualified to take his courses that summer, why, they would release
him.
them.

He came over to Oakland to see me to ask me if I would take
I still was very much of an easterner, and the idea of

driving 40 miles in order to teach some courses in the summer was not
quite my idea.

And I was very reluctant to do it.

But my

husband, who was devoted to Roger said to me, "I think we could do
this for Roger," which is a laugh, because he wasn't going to do
it at all.

But anyhow, I did it for Roger, came over that summer,

and taught his courses.

And it was then that Jack Hilgard, who

was head of the Department of Psychology, talked to me about the
possibility of coming to teach in the winter.

At that time, we were

still at war, and I had to get special tickets to get the gas to
come over here.

The drive from Oakland was marvelous;

there was

hardly anybody on the road because of the limitation on gas.

I

got to know the people on the Dumbarton Bridge who took the tickets,

and they'd often say, "Here comes the professor."

next summer, I participated in a workshop with Professor McDaniel
and Rex Bell, who were on the faculty in education at that time.
The workshop was on guidance in the schools.

The first thing you

At least three days a week I would come

from Oakland, which was the most that I could do.

Before I came,

I think for many years there had been one course in child psychology.
And that was all, either in education or in psychology.

And it

seems almost impossible to think of that now, with the number of
courses that have developed.

This course was open to graduates and

undergraduates, [though] it was really listed as an undergraduate
course.

But since it was the only one that was offered, there were

both graduates and undergraduates.

The students got interested,

and I began developing some practicums, so that they could go to the
nursery school and do some experimental work with children.
Then, I taught a course "Mental Hygiene and Education," which
was really for the education department, but was listed in the
psychology department also.
children.

I also taught a course on exceptional

The first course I taught that summer for Roger Barker

was on exceptional children.

This was a course given by the psychology

department but it was required in the State Department for certified
personnel in education.

Education and psychology were close and

interrelated, because Terman had been on the education faculty
under Cubberley, before he was made head of psychology.

Gradually

I became more and more interested in adolescent development, because I

56

Stolz:

was working on the longitudinal data at the University of California
and my husband and I had begun to work on a book that we finally
published in '51, entitled Somatic Development of Adolescent Boys.
So I offered a course in adolescent psychology.

At first, when I

taught the child psychology course, I went through adolescence, but
this was very difficult to do because there was so much material
to cover in one quarter.

So I ended the child psych, course before

the beginning of adolescence, and offered a course in adolescence.
The child psychology course was offered in the fall quarter and the
adolescent psychology in the winter or spring quarter.
the war, the students poured in here.
one little episode.

Just after

I think I ought to tell you

Jack Hilgard, when he asked me to come to

Stanford regularly, said, "I think you'll like it at Stanford."
He knew I'd been working in workshops in the summer, where we had
very small classes, and he said, "I know you like to work in small
• l
classes, intimately. We seldom have more than 40 in the class."

I

can remember, the first year I taught that child psychology course,
in January 1946, I came with about 50 mimeographed copies of materials
for these students.

The room that we were assigned was room one

in Cubberley, which I would say could hold about 50 or 60 students.
When I arrived that morning, having driven over from Oakland, it
was just a few minutes before nine.

I found the room, the corridors

outside, and the entrance hallway at Cubberley were just packed with
people.

I had 300 students!

This was just after the war.

(laughter)

Davis:

What do you think accounted for it, the subject matter itself?

S t oi z :

it was the G.I.'s coming in, with their veteran's benefits.

57

Stolz:

I've often thought that probably, well, I have two ideas of why
they came in.

One is that they thought, "Child psychology, that

ought to be easy."

(laughter)

The other reason is that many of

their wives had had children while the men were at war and the
men were having a heck of a time adjusting to these families.

I

think either or both things may have stimulated them to enroll.
We had to move into the auditorium at Cubberley.

with that course.

I, who had come

There were interesting experiences

The G.I.'s who sat in the back row would bring

their Stanford Dailys, or the morning newspaper, and read it.

So,

I finally suggested that I thought they'd be much more comfortable
if they would go to the lounge on the third floor, that if they
would not be more comfortable, I certainly would because it was
rather embarassing to me to find they were so uninterested.
we didn't have any more newspapers.

Well,

And another thing happened.

I

had this course planned for the students to do observation, and at
the last minute, I couldn't change it.

I had given out these directions

and when the second week their first observation of children was
due, here came 300 observations.

Since I didn't like to be up on

that stage, I had a table down on the same level with the students,
and they brought these papers in, and just slung them.

And when

the room was empty of students, I was completely surrounded by
papers, these 300 papers.
they landed on the floor.)

(You know, they'd just sling them and
Some of the men students began picking

them up, and getting them into shape for me.

One of the men, a great

big man with broad shoulders, I don't know his name, said, "Dr. Stolz,

58

Stolz

if you'll put me in charge of collecting these papers, you won't
have this happen again."

And I said, "Okay."

So the next time a

paper was due, he got up in front of the class, and he said, "I
have put two cartons in the back row.
of the cartons, it will be graded.
sweep it up after class."

If your paper is put in one
If not, the janitors will

And we never had any more trouble, (laughter)

Davis

I bet you learned a few tactics, certainly.

Stolz

I found out later that he was a top sergeant in the army during
the war. (laughter) So I would call him my top sergeant.

Davis

It must have been all males in the class, almost.

Stolz

Well, yes, a great many of them, most of them were, really.
The big crowd were males who had just come from the war.

And I

remember that at the end of the class, although I didn't approve
of objective examinations, I had to give them, with 300 students.
Two or three of the students offered to help on the correcting of
them.

So really, I established a relationship with some of them.

One of them, I still know, and [I] had dinner at his home last
Saturday.

[He was] in that first course.

He was in his second

year at Stanford, he wasn't a G.I.

What year was that, 1946 or '47?

Stolz

It was just after the European war closed, so it must have
been January, '46.

life

It was when that first group of G.I.'s came

That's always been a kind of humorous episode in my

With these G.I.'s, I found that some would make appointments

to come to see me in my office hours, but these men didn't come to
see me about the course in child development.

What they were telling

59

me about was the terrible time they were having with their
children, born during the war while they were away from home.

Now

they had come back, and were having a hectic time with them.

Many

of them were living in Stanford Village, which during the war, had
been a hospital.

After the war, Stanford got permission to have

G.I.'s and their families live in the dormitories that had been
built there.
I think probably before I tell you about that, though, I ought
to tell you about the nursery school, and how it got started, because
this was an important part.

This happened quite early, I'd say the

fall, probably, before I came over here.

That nursery school was

started through the initiative of these G.I.'s. Not their wives, but
the G.I.'s.

A group of them, three or four, went to the president of

the University, and said they wanted a nursery school.

Now, where

they ever heard of a nursery school, I will never know.
had never had any children.

Most of them

They got married right before they entered

military service, left pregnant wives, the babies were b o m , and later
they came back.

So, I don't know how they knew about nursery schools.

But anyhow, they went to the president, and asked him why they
couldn't have a nursery school for their children.

Well, the president

didn't know what to do about this, so he called Dean Bartky of
education, and said, "These G.I.'s want a nursery school at Stanford
Village where they are living; will you take it on?"

Well, Dean

Bartky didn't know anything about nursery schools either, so he called
up Jack Hilgard, head of psychology, and said, "What are we going to do?
The president wants us to have a nursery school at Stanford Village."

Stolz:

Jack Hilgard said, "I don't know anything about nursery schools,
but I know somebody who does, and she's over in Oakland.

conferences.

I'll

So he called me, and over I came, and we had several
Jack Hilgard got the Peninsula Volunteers to raise

money for the nursery school.

They would give a cocktail party once

a year, and raise $4000 at that cocktail party; you know, a
guest orders a martini, and probably gives them $5, or $10 for it.
This went on for several years.

The next thing we did was to

pick the recreation hall, which had been in the old Dibble Hospital,
and used that for the nursery school.
and we had to get some equipment.

We began getting it fixed up,

During the war, I had experience

in getting equipment, and I found out that the war surplus group
in Washington were now selling off an awful lot of equipment that
they'd had for child care centers during the war.

And so, we

got some of that surplus furniture, the same kind that we'd had at
Kaiser's, exactly, to furnish the nursery school.
cheaply, because it was war surplus.

We got them very

Then, we had to have a teacher.

The National Association of Nursery Education was having their annual
meeting in San Francisco.

And so Dean Bartky got one of his

graduate students to go to San Francisco and pick a teacher.

He

did this without consulting me, as I was not at Stanford every day.
This man didn't know anything about nursery schools, either.

So what

he did was to pick the most beautiful woman that was available.

Her
She

had married a man whom she knew at Pomona, just before he went to war.
Her husband had been killed during the war, and she had then gone to

61

Stolz:

Smith College, and taken the training for nursery school teachers.
When I first saw her, I thought, "Oh my goodness, anybody as beautiful as that, she'll. . .»

However, she was an excellent teacher.

I got to be very fond of her, and she's still my friend, she
lives in Palo Alto.

Actually, she later married a student of mine.

I sent him down to observe children at the nursery school, and he
observed her instead.

So, she is now Lucy Mallet Smith, and lives

She is active in the Adult Education Program for Parents.

Davis:

Oh, she's in the Palo Alto School District.

Stolz:

Yes, in the Palo Alto School District.
she turned out to be very good.

And anyhow,

Bartky and Hilgard set up an

advisory committee, including some parents and staff.

One of the

people on it was Leah Chodorow, whose husband is in the physics
department now.
time.

Her first child was in the nursery school at that

Another family whom you may know were Adelaide and Bill

Iverson, whose first child was enrolled.

Bill Iverson has been

associate dean of education at Stanford, just retired this year.

Many

of these people stayed on at Stanford, taking their final degrees,
and a few ended up on the faculty.
I developed some practicums because I wanted students to observe
children, and to do some experiments with them, so that they would begin
to understand research.

I wasn't really training them in research

techniques, as much as the technique of working with children in a
small room.

Then, as I said previously, these men students would

come in during my office hours, supposedly to talk about something
m

the course, but they were really talking about what a heck of

62

Stolz:

a time they were having with their children.

Davis:

What was their major complaint?

Stolz:

Well, you'll have to read my book, (laughter)

Davis:

Yes, is that where it all is?

Stolz:

little bit about it.

The men just returned from

the war were having a very difficult time in adjusting to their
children, adjusting to their wives, and also taking courses--men, many
of whom had been away for three or four years.

I went to Jack Hilgard

and said to him, "You know, Jack, you ought to get some money to make
a study of these families, because it's really very excellent material."
Roger Barker later said to me, "You know, you couldn't do an experiment
like that.

You couldn't send this father off, to be away from his

children for four years, let this father return and then study his
relations with his children.

You couldn't do that.

But society has

done it for you, and you're making use of that situation."
after I was doing this study.

This was

He said, "You're making use of what

society has experimented [with]; society did the experiment."

That was

Well, Jack Hilgard said to me, "Why

I said, "Oh, I don't have the facilities, I don't have

And he said, "You know, the National Institute of Mental

Health is beginning to get some funds, and maybe you could get some of
those for it."

So, I wrote to the National Institute of Mental Health,

and I got the first grant that came to Stanford from the National Institute
of Mental Health, to make this study.

I began setting the study up with

interviews with fathers, a series of them, a series of interviews with
mothers, observations of the children, those three approaches.
Davis:

How many cases did you have?

63

Stolz:

Well, we finally matched up 40 cases.

I think it was 39, actually.

We miscalculated on some. For instance, the Iversons.

they were a separated family.

Well, I later learned after collecting

a lot of data that he had come back to visit the baby twice, and
I had to have cases in which the father did not see the child until
after he was at least one year old.

Many of the children were three

or four years old when the father returned.
is very interesting.

The material, I think,

I began to have graduate students who wanted

to do master's theses or Ph.D.'s as part of this study.

So I

set up research seminars, and Alberta Siegel, whom you may know, did
her master's degree research; Edith Dowley did her doctorate degree,
and Margaret Faust did her master's degree research.
Davis:

Organized around this study?

Stolz:

Yes, so that each contributed material for the book.

I did

the interviews with all of what I called "experimental fathers,"
the ones that had been separated.

And I had someone else do the

interviews with the non-experimental fathers, those fathers who
were not separated from their children. I think that was not a
good technique; I should have done half of each.

Well, this book

was finally published in 1954 by Stanford University Press.

I had

quite a research staff, and an executive secretary to keep track
of all of the data, appointments, and so forth.
That was the first research which I did at Stanford.

I was

at the same time working on a book with my husband, that was published
by MacMillan in '51, The Somatic Development of Adolescent Boys.

I was

64

Stolz:

keeping busy.

I kept teaching the two courses.

I dropped "Mental

Hygiene in Education/' I don't remember what year, and did the two
major courses in child development and adolescence, the research
seminars, and the practicum.

And then Robert Sears came to Stanford

in '55, and was the head of the psychology department.
had become dean of humanities and sciences.

Hilgard

At that time, I had

developed an advanced course in child psych, for graduate students.
It became so popular after Sears came that we divided it in two
sections, and he took the students who were psych, majors and I
took the students in this advanced course who were education majors.
Davis:

And this was given through psychology, or through education?

Stolz:

It was still offered in psychology, but I took those students
majoring in education.

We had a good many very outstanding students

in education, who were interested in the child development field.
I got the idea that what we ought to do was to have a child
development major in education, as well as psychology, because
there were many of these people in education who were excellent
people; but they didn't have the background in psychology to meet
all our demands.

Most of our graduate students in psychology were

majors in psychology as undergraduates, before they came to graduate
school.

I talked this over with Robert Sears, and he thought it

was a very good idea.

He said, "Do you know whether education wants

At this time, Pauline Sears was teaching in the education department,
and she had a Ph.D. in psychology, and there were several people in
guidance who had related backgrounds.
interested.

So the dean was very much

But he said, "What will psychology think of this?"

65

Stolz:

And I said, "I've already talked with them and Robert Sears has
approved it."

I added, "You can call on the phone and find out."

So he did right then, and it went through.

I think I only had a

couple more years before I was going to retire, and I said, "If
you want me to, I'll act as chairman; we'll set up a committee,
and I'll be chairman of that Committee on Child Development in
Education until I retire, and then it can be somebody in education."
I thought it would be Pauline Sears, and it was, actually.

She

was the only person at Stanford at that time in child development
in education.
Davis:

This is the second tape on today's third session with Dr.
Stolz, and we thought we'd take a little time to concentrate on
Dr. Stolz's involvement with various women's organizations and
causes both in the national and international scenes, and also at
Stanford University.

Which one would you like to begin with?

I

think you were talking a little bit about the International Committee
for, what was the name of it again?
Stolz:

You were doing evaluating for them.

For a good many years now, I really can't think how long.

Maybe

since 1950 or so, the International Federation of University Women
has asked me to evaluate the applications they have for fellowships
or scholarships, or grants in aid for future study that are in the
field of child psychology, psychology in general, or education.
Each year, they send me the applications they have received. They
come from (for example) people in India who want to study in England,
people in South America who want to study in the United States,
or people from England who want to study here.

I evaluate their

background, their plan for what they want to do, and whether the

not able to do that.

Now sometimes, I'm

For instance, last year, someone wanted to

go to Sussex, England to study there, and I don't know anything
about the University at Sussex.

So what I did was to evaluate

her background, and her plan of study, and said that they'd have
to get someone else to say whether that was an appropriate place.
Well, they found it was.
Davis

They send you all of the applications?

Stolz

Well, there aren't that many because, for instance, an application

I mean, that must be. . .

in anthroplogy wouldn't be sent to me, unless it happened to be,
well, if somebody wanted to study at Columbia, or Stanford, someplace
I've been connected with, and they didn't have anyone else to ask.
Once in a while I get applications outside of my own field because
the person plans on coming to the United States.
Davis

Are these sizeable scholarships that they give?

Stolz

Oh yes, they give very good fellowships, and they give scholarships and grants in aid in addition.
been going on for years.

It's a big program which has

Of course, the American Association of

University Women in the United States gives scholarships too, to
women.

But since I left the A.A.U.W.. I've not been on that award

committee.

But I have for the International Federation, and this

brings rather interesting material.

I also get applications in

medicine, if they're going to study child guidance, because I have
contact with the child guidance clinics, and know the institutions
to evaluate them.

These foreign students sometimes will meet a

traveller for example, who happens to be on the staff of a university,

67

Stolz:

and they'll sav lin
rh^ o n n i ^ ^ '
n tne a
PPlication that they're going to study with
this person.

One application I got had two peoples' names that I

couldn't find, who were supposed to be in the field of psychology.
I couldn't find either one in any of the directories of psychology
or child development.

I happened to know the head of the department

at this particular university, so I called him long distance, and
asked, "Who are these people?"

And he said, "Oh, one was a graduate

student, but he's gone now, and the other one was a nurse!" You see,
an applicant in a foreign country sometimes becomes confused about
visitors she meets.
Davis:

Were these for undergraduate work, or all for graduate work?

Stolz:

These were for graduate work, they're all graduate fellowships.
Grants in aid are for graduate study, quite often for people who
have responsible positions in their own country, and want to come
visit institutions or programs maybe for two weeks.

The federation

asks me whether they're qualified to do it, and whether those are
the best places for them to visit.

So that's a rather interesting

activity that occurs once a year.
The last few years I have been working with Radcliffe College
which has gotten out three volumes of an Encyclopedia of Notable
American Women.

The first three volumes that were edited by a

husband and wife by the name of James, dealt with women from the
1600's to 1950.

One of the women who was included in that was

Helen Thompson Wooley, a psychologist whom I knew very well.
was asked to write her biography for that encyclopedia.

And I

They've

decided recently, this past year, to publish a fourth volume, which

68

Stolz:

will be women who died between 1950 and 1975.

And they have a new

young woman who is the editor of this, and she has asked me to
do some consulting work concerning who should be selected.

She

asked me for the names of women in the field of education.

And

I collected those, sent them the names of several professors, women
professors at Stanford, and people whom I knew, who had died during
that period whom I would recommend to be included, in elementary
and secondary education.

Fred Glover suggested several people and

Dr. Fannie Shaftel sent me names, and I sent them all in.

It was quite a job; I suppose they got hundreds of

Later they sent me a list of 60 women whom they had

selected from the different lists, organized in groups, with directions to select 14 from this group, and six from that.

I had

to select which of those I would recommend and state why.
Davis:

Did they send you information about them, as well as their names?

Stolz:

No, they just listed their names, on the assumption that I
would—well, they identified them, they would say the University
of Arizona, or something of this sort, but that's all, just

If I didn't know a person, I would just write, "Do

wanted the rater to know the person as basis for the judgement.

didn't know the person, so that was part of the rating.

Well, if you did do it, would it mean doing quite a bit of
traveling, to gather the information?

Stolz:

You'd think that they would supply you with it, if you were
doing some work for them.

Stolz:

Oh, they couldn't do it [with] the number of people they must
have had writing for them.
As you know, in 1975, the women's group of the ASSU at Stanford,
Associated Students, decided they wanted to give a tea to honor
Stanford women.

And I was asked if I would make a few remarks.

So that's what I planned to do.

About a week, I think it w a s — I

70

Stolz:

really don't think it was more than a week before the meeting,
Leah Kaplan called me, and said they would like me to make an address.
So, I had a week to write a speech, and I wrote a paper "Women in
Stanford History."

I didn't have time to go to the library; I used

my own library on women.

I had David Starr Jordan's [two volume]

autobiography, The Bays of Man, and used that a good deal, and a
report that the faculty women had prepared some time ago.

I had

various sources on my own shelves, and that's all I had access to.
I did call up, as usual, Fred Glover, and he gave me some information.
And then I got some from various departments in the University
through Fred Glover.

Jeanne Porter, in the general secretary's office,

sent me material; Ernestine Drummond, faculty personnel assistant,
sent me some; and Robert Houghton, associate registrar, sent me data.
Fred Glover had asked them to help me out.

I used Alberta Siegel's

report on women at Stanford; Cleo Eulau of the Department of Psychiatry
S
gave me some information; and also Paul Farnsworth, who is retired,
who's been at Stanford since the '20's.

With their help, plus my

own library, I wrote this paper on women at Stanford.

I tried to

show what had developed in the United States in women's education
during the nineteenth century that preceded and influenced what happened
at Stanford.

David Starr Jordan's experience as a student at Cornell,

when they didn't accept women, but then later did, [influenced] his
own feelings about women being included at Stanford.

At first, there

was no question about it, the Stanfords had thought of this as a
university for men, because they established it in honor of their son,
and therefore it was a men's institution. I'm sure David Starr Jordan

71

Stolz:

had some influence on adm-itt^n
nue on admitting women.

,
,
Later, when he found that the

dormitory for women wasn't going to be open in time for the inauguration,
and therefore the women would have to come in later, he was emphatic
that that wasn't right, that men and women should both come in at the
same time.

Mrs. Stanford therefore got busy and demanded that they

put more workmen on the job and finish that dormitory so women could
be admitted with men.

I think that's important to remember, because

so often it's been said that Mrs. Stanford was against women.

This

was an important thing to do; she realized it, and cooperated.
What was the limit of the 500 then related to?
Well, that was on a different basis.

And I think I bring this

up in the paper, that after Mr. Stanford died, his estate was in
the courts for years with many creditors suing for funds.

At one

time, they thought that the University was going to have to close.
David Starr Jordan thought it was going to have to.

Mrs. Stanford

took the stand that she was going to keep it open if she possibly
could after she'd thought about it.

They had to cut back on staff

and expenses because they were running on a shoestring.

By 1900--I

give the enrollment figures I'd gotten from the University—the number
of men was going down steadily.

This was because it was the advanced

courses, technical courses in engineering, and so forth, which they
were cutting.

And so, they would send men who were going into law

or engineering to other institutions to study.

After completing

the second year, these men were going to other institutions, so that
by the time 1900 came, it looked as if it was going to become a women's
institution.

So, Mrs. Stanford decided that enrollment should

be limited to 500 women.

Not because she was against women, and this

72

I think has always been misinterpreted, but because she wanted it
to be for men, too, and women.

As the debts gradually got settled,

and the estate got straightened out, they began developing the advanced
courses again, and men didn't leave after the second year.
The figures are startling in many ways, as you can see in that article.
What I was trying to show is that Stanford didn't start out right
out of the blue; there'd been a long history during the 19th century
of gradually allowing women, and providing facilities for women to
have higher education.

One organization that had started to promote

this was the Association of Collegiate Alumnae (now the A.A.U.W.).
It was started in Boston by a small group of college women to make
it possible for more women to go to college.

Their whole purpose

for many years, really [their] primary purpose, was the extending
of opportunities for women to go to college, and, when women did
get in, to have the facilities for them that were equal to those
for men.

I tried to give that background, that started in the 1800's,

as background for establishing Stanford, including David Starr
Jordan's experience at Cornell.

There is a discussion of some of

the early graduates at Stanford.

Then I ended on a note which I

think is rather important.

We have these endowed professorships

at Stanford, many of which women had contributed to, either
with their husbands, or they contributed after a husband died, in his
honor.

A few of these were named for women.

But there's not been

any faculty woman ever appointed to an endowed professorship.

I

challenged those young ASSU women to see to it that this got changed.
And I don't know whether the following episode had anything to do with

what happened or not.
J m g Lyman was at this meeting, and she asked me to send her a
copy of the paper, which I did.

When I saw her at a reception some

time later, I said to her, "You didn't think of passing that paper
on to anybody, did you?"

She smiled and said, "Oh, of course not."

Oh, another thing--none of the endowed professorships had ever been
named for a woman professor, whereas I think there were ten or eleven
of them that had been named for men professors.

Well, last year, a

professorship was named for the late Professor Helen C. Farnsworth
of the Food Research Institute.

That was the first one, and that

Stanley McCormack Memorial Professor in Pediatrics, and Professor
Ruth Gross was appointed to that named professorship.
we've made two little dents.
Davis:

So, at least

That's pretty good, one a year.

Yes, I think that's very good, and I hope that we can continue
with that.

Stolz:

I also listed about a dozen names of women who had been at
Stanford while I was there, whom I thought were well qualified to have
a professorship named in their honor.

Davis:

You also mentioned that on the occasion of your retirement
or just before your retirement, you were asked to address a group
of undergraduates. . .

Stolz-

Yes.

I was asked to speak to a group of undergraduate students who

were having a series of lectures.

So what I decided to do, and

I think now it's kind of interesting--! decided to talk to them about

models for them.

I thought they would be nice role

What I did was to write to several of my former

students, and ask them some questions about these matters, and how
they felt about the process.
Margaret Siler Faust.

I remember one letter that I had from

she married and left here.

After that, she worked on her dissertation

Everytime she'd have a child, she'd do something on her

dissertation, because she had a completely free week, then, in the
hospital.

In those days, you stayed in the hospital a week, you know.

She finally finished her doctorate, and now is a full professor at
Scripps College, and has three daughters, who are grown.

One of the

things she said in that letter was, "Of course, I could never have
done it if Don hadn't wanted me to do it."
and a professor at Pomona.

Don Faust is her husband

She said she thinks this was very important,

because she had no struggle; whenever she had the desire to proceed,
he fitted in and wanted to help, and he was as interested in her
going on as she had been.

the psychology department at Stanford.

Well, I gave several case studies

I think such a case may provide a very

interesting kind of role model for undergraduate women.

Davis:

alumnae who have done the dual thing.

Davis:

Yes.

And of course, the interesting research design would

probably be to have them as an experimental group, and then your
non-experimental group would be the ones that did lose touch, and
what was it in their lives that made them really give up, because
there are a whole group of women who have had very highly professional
ambitions in their early lives, and then just let them go completely.
Stolz:

Well, now, Connie Menniger who has only recently taken a job,
is a very good example of another kind.

She had six children, and

Davis

What occasioned your move, and how did you finally decide to
move to Palo Alto?

Because I remember, you were living in Oakland,

Stolz

Well, we moved over here when my husband retired.

Davis

I see, so not until quite late.

Stolz

When he retired, he wanted to move.

You see, he had graduated

from Stanford, and had close ties over here, and many people in
Palo Alto were his Stanford generation [and] knew him.

I can't tell

you, when we first moved, how many people just stopped by in Portola

Stolz:

They were men who had

gone to Stanford, and then lived in Palo Alto; so that he had many
contacts over here.

I never

But I've never done

And so, I didn't want to move, even though I was doing the

commuting, and everybody said that it was I who wanted to do it.
But it wasn't I, at all.

And in fact, the way we got that place

was kind of an accident, because it was through the Sears that
we got it; it was next door to them, they had just bought this lot,
and persuaded us.
Davis:

I see, so you were actually a commuting spouse for a long time
from Oakland, for years.

Stolz:

I was commuting from Oakland, yes, that's right, and had been
doing that all those years.

So you'd think that I would have wanted

to move, but I just don't like to move, (laughter)

And after my

husband died, I stayed in Portola Valley four years, because I
didn't want to move.
Davis:

You did!

Well, this has been a very, very pleasant interview,

and thank you very much.
