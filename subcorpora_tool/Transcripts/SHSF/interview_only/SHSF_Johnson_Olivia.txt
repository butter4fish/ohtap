Press: Sort of start autobiographically, I’ll start this way. I know your father graduated
from Amherst. Right?
Johnson: Right.
Press: And then he came to Stanford in 1910. Where were you born?
Johnson: I was born in Concord, Massachusetts.
Press: Concord, Mass. And, uh, did you come out here, uh, at age…let’s see, how old are
you now? You’re…
Johnson: I’m 95. 95, no I’m 85.
Press: 85.
Johnson: 85 now. I’ve got ten years to go until I’m 95. Father graduated from Amherst,
and he was said to have gotten the highest grades that had ever been taken at Amherst as
a student. Then, um, he went to Germany for two years and was going to get another
degree, a higher degree, in his Classics. But he decided that knowing Europe and
knowing the German people was more important than classics. So he didn’t *inaudible*
and it’s a sad thing because that degree would have been helpful all his life. But, he came
back and taught in Cornell, where a great many professors were gathered by Dr. Jordon.
Press: Oh yes.
Johnson: And there he met my mother…
Press: Was she a student?
Johnson: She was a Cornell student. She was one of the early co-eds who graduated from
Cornell. And I have her dance programs, and with Charles Wing and David Marks and
Guido Marks and various other Stanford professors are listed on her…
Press: On her dance program at Cornell? Oh, how sweet.
1

Johnson: Yes, yes. And this family story that is great fun...father always used to like to
pick a leaf as he was walking and talking. And, he would chew on this leaf. And he was
walking by *inaudible* waters with mother, and inadvertently picked a poison Oak leaf,
or poison Ivy leaf. And it led to quite a time in their lives.
Press: I’ll bet it did. Were they engaged then?
Johnson: They were engaged, yes. And then father had a, they were married, and father
had an invitation to go to Swarthmore. And he went to, um, he went to President White
and asked if there was any chance of an advancing salary at Cornell. And, told him of this
offer from Swarthmore which was much more favorable financially, and, uh, President
White said, “No, there isn’t any money that can go into that this year. And, Swarthmore
is a very find college, and I think you’d be wise to accept that offer with your marriage
and your need of more funds.” So they did go to Swarthmore. And, uh, mother had a
half-sister who was very fashion conscious, and she had undertaken mother’s
*inaudible*, which was very elaborate, very beautiful. And then when father accepted
this job at Swarthmore, nothing but dark simple clothes or black and grey could be worn.
So, all mother’s trousers stayed in the closet until they went to Philadelphia on weekends
where father’s uncle, I think it was…no, his mother’s cousin was the head of the B&O
railroad there, and they had a very “Fletcher Kenny,” they had a very gay social life, and
that was where father and mother got a little relief from the Swarthmore straight-laced
attitude of things. They were walking once near the campus, father and mother together,
and mother was sad. And she leaned her head on father’s shoulder, and he patted her and
comforted her. And then when she was feeling a little better, he said, “Birtha, dear, you
know you must never make a mark of affection in public at Swarthmore. You know, it
isn’t a thing that they like.”
Press: Must’ve been a very interesting place for them.
Johnson: It was a very interesting place. And they met a number of very dear, precious
friends there. And, uh, the Swarthmore young professors at that time were buying a
property in New England—farms that were being abandoned by famers who could get
free land in the mid-west, in the plains country where you didn’t have to fight hills and
rocks and adverse conditions. And, they could be picked-up for very little money. A man
that could get some money for his farm and his little hundred acres and his little house
was lucky. And father bought four of these farms, and two of them had houses and two of
them had cellar holes.
Press: Where were they in New England?
Johnson: In New Hampshire, about ten miles north of Monadnock. So the Monadnock
and the open pastures that were then prevalent in New Hampshire had beautiful views…
Press: Oh, I’m sure….

2

Johnson: And lovely summer gardens. And a whole group of these young college
professors were there. And had these homes. And the house that they decided to live in
had marvelous timbering, hand [inaudible] great square timbers. That sort of thing, you
know, very early, very smooth when people’s hands would come in contact with them.
And, they took out some petitions to have somewhat larger rooms, and did some
reconstruction and did quite a lot of painting. And the house gradually got named by the
country people that lived around there “the painted lady.” They had a lovely time there.
Father eventually became interested in the university extension work , and my sister and I
don’t know whether he taught at the University of Chicago or whether he simply worked
at the university extension there. He went to the university extension in England, and
there got to know Mr. Ashby among others. And, had very dramatic satisfying
experiences in Oxford, in places that he had always known about, read about, and loved
very dearly. And, they lived there in Chicago. He had a very bad railway accident and a
long time of convalescents. But finally, the doctor said, “aren’t you two going to have
any children?” And, they said , “Yes, yes when the time comes.” And the doctor said,
“Well, I think you better rethink when the time is coming because the time is passing.”
And, well they thought it over and they finally decided they’d have a little girl, and they
had the little girl. I was born in Concord, Massachusetts where my grandmother lived—
my father’s mother.
Press: What’s your birthday?
Johnson: April 14th, 1896. And the earliest story, well the one story that always amuses
me. Father couldn’t find anything to do during the hours that I was coming into the
world, and mother was using a little apartment that had been used for my uncle—a
bedroom and living and bathroom, and it was out from side of the house and had a tin
roof. And, father had a hose, it was a warm day, and he spent the time while I was
arriving hosing down the tin roof to make it cooler for his wife, which was a lovely note.
Press: Fathers do wonderful things, don’t they?
Johnson: Yes. They get kept busy some way.
Press: Gotta keep ‘em out of the way.
Johnson: Then the other story about that [inaudible] was that father was an old friend of
Edward Emerson, Ralph W. Emerson’s son, and of Ellen Emerson. And Ellen Emerson
came to see my mother a few days after I arrived, and held this little creature. And I think
that a newborn baby is not an attractive creature at all. But anyway, she held this little
baby and she looked-up at mother and said, “Oh, Birtha, she has every perfection.”
Which was the wisdom of a maiden lady.
Press: I think it’s lovely, and accurate.
Johnson: Well, thank you. Then, when the um, they were living in Chicago they were
spending the winter time…I don’t know the sequence of events, but they were living with
3

a Mrs. Pope, the professor’s wife there, before they found other places to live. And um,
she, um I got mumps. And she said, “Oh, don’t worry about mumps, they’re nothing.
Don’t think about it.” And, so mother didn’t worry about mumps. And, that resulted in
that they abscessed, and it was a horrific to-do and there was an operation with much
fright. And, finally the doctor said, “If you want to keep your little girl, you’ll have to
leave this climate. She simply can’t stand it.” And just at that time, a call came to
Stanford from his, from Stanford from Dr. Jordon, I think because of father’s connection
to Cornell….
Press: Probably, yeah
Johnson: Because that’s where Jordon was getting many of his men, and to come to
California…
Press: Was he, was your father still connected to Cornell at this time when you were in
Chicago?
Johnson: No, no.
Press: I see, but he had been?
Johnson: Yes, he had been, in fact for quite a while. And, um, I like to remember that
they had gone to an art exhibit—I think at the Art Institute—which had a great many
paintings of California. And, they had fallen in love with the painting of the golden hills.
And, uh, father and mother decided that they would leave everything they knew and
come to California. I was really the cause of it.
Press: Dr. Jordon offered him a faculty position at that time?
Johnson: Yes. He offered him a job as the head of the Latin Department or under
Augustus Murray, I think it was Augustus Murray, under the Greek Department. And
father wanted to be in Greek so he took the lesser job under Murray. I think that he
enjoyed his teaching very much. He was [inaudible]. We have a number of friends who
speak of having had courses with father at Stanford, and that they enlightened their whole
lives because he had so much appreciation for what Greece meant…what Rome…
Press: Let me interrupt you just for a second. That phrase you used, “he enlightened their
whole lives,” what a…if in a few words attribute to a teacher that really says it. You
know, that should be emblazoned on the doorway of a college: “They enlighten their
lives.” That is just a lovely thing to say about a teacher….
Johnson: Yes, and it’s um, it’s more or less a motto for what father felt about teaching.
He felt that you, you needed to impart to the student your love of the subject and your
love of the subject. I don’t remember it in Palo Alto, but after we moved up into the
Sharon Hills, father always walked back and forth. And, uh, he would be late for dinner
over and over because as he walked across the quad and down the corridors, students
4

would walk with him. And, then another student would gather and another. And they’d
end up sitting on the steps somewhere and talking. I don’t know what about but he
always gave himself to his students, gave his time, and mother never complained. It was
alright. Father used to feel that it was a great shame that the great scholars are likely to be
put teaching the graduate students, the seniors, the upper-division students, the graduate
students…and he felt that the great vivid minds could do more for the beginning students.
Press: How true, because beginning student is so ready to be turned in so many different
directions and to be enlightened as it were. And, which leads me to a question: how did
your father, if you know, get interested in the Classics? Was it a teacher who enlightened
him along the way?
Johnson: That I don’t know.
Press: I’m just curious. You said he went to Oxford and had…did he go to Greece and
Italy? Had he ever been there?
Johnson: Yes. After he had this very terrible accident, he had gone to a southern city, and
I had, I should know what it was but I don’t. And he would go for a lecture, he would be
invited to dinner, he would make his lecture and then he would take a home if it were a
bit long distance. Uh, he usually went home that same night. And, uh, this was a very
stormy night, and somebody had made a mistake with switches and the car, the Pullman
car that he was in was rammed by another train. When he got on the train there was no
conductor there, and he stepped into the car and shook the porter awake—he was
sleeping. And, said, “I’m here, and I’m going down to my inaudible”, and went down to
an [inaudible] that was way down at the end of the car. Then when the train, the car was
rammed, the engine had [inaudible] into the car and it was catching fire. And the rescue
people said, well, I think we got everyone now. And the Pullman conductor said, “No sir,
no sir, there’s one man here, I know there’s another man in here.” And they then went
down where it was getting very hot, and one of them called, “Here’s a head.” And, father
was so injured with falling timbers and all that uh, they had a very bad time getting him
out, but they got him out ahead of the flames. And, uh, he was desperately ill for a very
long time. And, um, so you know he had to learn to walk all over again.
Press: Where was he when this happened? Was he Cornell faculty or…
Johnson: Oh no, this was university extension….
Press: University extension, I see…
Johnson: Going out of Chicago. And, uh, the railway made a very generous settlement.
And father and mother went to Greece for a long winter there.
Press: Oh, I see. So he really did spend some time there to get to know it.
Johnson: Yes. He had a very wonderful experience.
5

Press: Did he speak Greek and Latin?
Johnson: Yes, he did. And one thing that I have found extremely interesting was that he
went, as I told you when he was a student at [inaudible], he went on train trips all over
Europe to learn to know Europe, and he said that they, you would get six or eight men in
a compartment. And there would be a priest or two and a gentleman or two and just an
ordinarily train men or two…and they all knew Latin. And Latin was Esperanto—they
conversed in Latin. And I have a grandson, Craig Johnson, who lives in Santa Cruz now,
and his tremendously enthuse about Classics, to him it means the world. I think it’s so sad
he couldn’t have known my father. But, he says that he finds Latin an Esperanto now. So
many people speak Spanish, and he can talk with a Spanish talking person. He using
Latin and they struggling, and he struggling with their Spanish.
Press: Isn’t that astounding!
Johnson: Of course not very many people can speak Latin.
Press: No, not anymore. I know my wife studied Latin in junior high school and high
school. She took four years of it, I think. And, she insisted that our two daughters, we
also have a son, all our children take Latin. And, the first one took four years of it, the
next one took two years of it, and our son I think took two years of it. It goes that way.
But, all of them have said how it has helped them understand English. You know, it’s the
basis. And they all love words, and it’s such a delight to know the origin and roots of the
words.
Johnson: Yes. Well, I never had Latin or Greek because father said he wasn’t going to
have Latin and Greek butchered for his children. And, as we were growing-up his
strength was diminishing, and he never found the strength over in the things he was doing
to teach us Latin and Greek. I always regret it because it was a shame.
Press: Well, when they came to California because of your health and because of the job
offer, how old were you then?
Johnson: I was six.
Press: Six. And, uh, you came out I presume on the train?
Johnson: Came out on the train and rented a little house on Embarcadero road. And
across from the house, the southern part of Palo Alto now, there wasn’t a thing to be seen
except grain fields and white oaks, and live oaks. And one of the episodes that I
remember very strongly from that time was father was thinking about the wonderful
view that could be had from that area, but from the upper storage. And, um, so he
climbed up a tree using a vine that was up the tree. And, uh, didn’t realize that this was
another form of Poison Ivy. I remember vividly my father sitting with nothing on in a big
rocking chair that had a sheet over it. And, mother patting the sheet to keep it wet against
6

his anatomy, which was inflamed. And, he couldn’t see so his eyes were closed with
Poison Ivy. But, they love the golden hills. And, we lived in a house on the corner of
Ramona and Lincoln Avenue.
Press: Ramona and Lincoln. Ah, yes, I know where that it. Was that your, the rental that
you…
Johnson: Yes, rented from Mrs. Angel
Press: Mrs. Angel as in the Angel Field at Stanford?
Johnson: Mhm
Press: For goodness sake….
Johnson: And, uh, let’s see where was I going on that one?
Press: Well, I asked you where you first, how you got out here and you said you rented
the house there, and you just told me it was on Ramona and Lincoln. And, um, below it
there were nothing but fields. Uh. You…
Johnson: Well, the housed the little house that we lived in first on Embarcadero was the
one…
Press: I see. Then you moved into one on Lincoln…
Johnson: Ramona and Lincoln…
Press: That was…
Johnson: There were lived there until the earth quake came….
Press: Oh yeah….
Johnson: And I remember very vividly the morning of the earthquake. I had asked father
what an earthquake was, and one day the house trembled a little and he said, “Now, that’s
an earthquake.” So when the morning of the 18th of April arrived, I felt the, my bed
walloping around. Father slept very badly all those later years after his long illness. And,
mother had taken a big bedroom and had put the beds of my little sister who was a little
girl then, let’s see 1906 she would have been four, and my bed next to hers. And, I
remember turning over and grabbing the mattress and hanging on. And, then I saw father
coming in the door. And, uh, he was in his pajamas and the same high back rocking chair
that had been a wedding present from my grandparents was in the room, and he grabbed
it because he was about to fall. And I remember vividly the dance, the father in the
rocking chair dance [inaudible] laughter earthquake [inaudible] laughter.

7

Press: Ok, how did your house do? Were there any problems?
Johnson: Well, there were the problems that everybody had. The chimney was, the top of
the chimney was shaken off. They were supposed…the chimneys were supposed to be
fire hazards after that. And, uh, they announced firmly that there were going to be heavy
aftershocks. So, everyone moved out onto the laws. They moved mattresses out and they
moved little cooking arrangements out. We had a very devout Catholic maid, Anne
Caneily, and she said that if there was not priest around to bless the water a Catholic
could bless the water. And she blessed a bucket of water and went around and scattered it
all through the house. And, after that she was protected. So, she simply took a dustpan
and brush and began cleaning-up. And, it had been rose season, and my mother had
marvelous roses. And, she had great, and she had great bunches of roses everywhere. So,
the house was strewn with broken vases and water and dying roses. But we…
Press: The house held its structure…
Johnson: The house held and was repaired afterwards. And, I just found out recently that
mother and father had previously to the earthquake bought a piece of land with a Mr. and
Mrs. Doge. They bought forty acres. It was just north of the old….
Press: Dodge?
Johnson: Yes.
Press: Go ahead.
Johnson: It was just north of the old Sharon house up on Sand Hill Road. It was about a
quarter of a mile north of the Sharon house, and the property inaudible. And, right after
the earthquake they built up there a little one story wooden house. And, we lived up there
until our father’s work at Stanford was over and we went to Europe there. It was a
marvelous place to be. You are surrounded by the smooth hills from, uh, from our house
you looked out into the mountains from the golden saddle at the top of the green
mountain…
Press: Yes…
Johnson: And from rattlesnake ridge, which we called rattlesnake ridge because of the
adventure with rattlesnakes. And I hear it’s called rattlesnake ridge now.
Press: Oh, I’m sure. I’ve heard that.
Johnson: And, it where they do inaudible….
Press: Yeah

8

Johnson: There, clear up to the mountains behind San Mateo there was not one building
in sight. Not one building.
Press: There wasn’t?
Johnson: With the exception of the tiny peak of a roof of a farm house more or less bac of
Redwood City, San Mateo, where Mr. and Mrs. Fuller had a poon ranch. And certain
times of the year it was white with this little [inaudible] sticking up there. And other
times it was open country and oh so beautiful.
Press: How great. How long did you live at Ramona and Lincoln? Incidentally I don’t
want to tire you. How about we go five more minutes, is that alright?
Johnson: I don’t know just when we moved in there, but my mother was pregnant when
we came out, and was very miserable. And, I know that we had moved to Ramona and
Lincoln before my sister was born. So, and I don’t, I’m a little chattery about the dates
there.
Johnson: Two little anecdotes about that Embarcadero living. We lived next to that
professor, I think it was Professor Gilbert—I’m vague about the name—but he had three
children who, I think it was three, who were slightly older than I was. And, um,
somebody had told these children to be nice to this little girl. And they were, they were
completely darling. And they had a game that just fitted me—I adored it. You climbed up
a step ladder, they had a tremendous live oak in their back yard, you climbed up the step
ladder, you took two branches of the live oak in your hands and then by unequal pressure
on the branches you get to swinging. And you gave, you released one hand and put it in
the other and marched around the tree this way by changing branch to branch to branch.
Press: That sounds fun.
Johnson: And then all the other children kept a stop watch on you to see how fast you
could do it. But I thought so many times of those children, and how perfectly wonderful
they were to a very lonesome little girl. And the other thing was that Christmas was
coming and I wanted a Christmas tree for my dolly. And I know that father and mother
had no extra pennies for anything at that stage with Beatrice coming and all. And so
father and I walked down in to the [inaudible] track, it was called, south of Embarcadero,
and we picked a beautiful symmetrical bunch of grease work and brought it back. And
father helped me wire the things together, the branches together so that they made a
symmetrical tree and put it in a tin can of water, and that was my Christmas tree for my
dollies.
Press: How nice.
Johnson: Just those two things I remember.
Press: What a lovely thing to do.
9

Press: We can talk a little bit about Stanford and your father going to work. How did he,
um, get to the campus? Did he bicycle or walk or what?
Johnson: Is it on?
Press: Yeah, we’re on now.
Johnson: My father usually walked. He walked a great deal. And he usually walked to the
university. Very often I would go skipping along beside him. My memory goes back to
when my sister was a baby and she was six years younger than I was, so, I must’ve been
7 or 8.
Press: That’s right. She was born here after you arrived.
Johnson: Yes, yes. And father would walk, as I remember, out Lincoln and down to
Embarcadero and then we’d cross the Embarcadero. Father never allowed me to cross the
railroad tracks unless I was with him and unless he had time to stop and see me back
across the tracks again. And, it was a great point of honor. Now, I don’t remember how
he established it because I was a child that was inclined to set my own rules of what was
right and what was wrong. And, my rule agreed with father’s rule in that case, I accepted
the fact that I would not cross the railroad track alone. And, I didn’t accept all facts like
that. But it was a very hard decision to make for me because on the other side of the
railway track, on the north side of Embarcadero, was a very deep ditch along the side the
road, and it always had water in it. And it always had the most superior inaudible, and
there was a farm there where the market is now and a great row of ash trees that used to
be very beautiful in the fall with the color of the leaves and the hanging seeds. And, when
father had a little extra time I was allowed to take a mason jar and he would stand and
watch and talk while I caught some polywads. Then he would see me back across the
railroad tracks, and he would wave and go on his way. And, I would go back home with
my treasures. But, once in a while I did walk-up to University with father when he had
some minor errand to do…walk through the Arboretum, which I loved dearly and up to
his office building. And, after the earthquake I remember going up with him to see what
had happened in his office. And, I remember very vividly climbing the stairs, there was
rock tumbled here and there, and climbing the stairs and going into his office and we
carefully examined what we saw, and realized that the earthquake had shaken the doors
of either side of his cabinets, and thrown the material in them under the floor. And then
another motion of the earth had closed the doors, piled rock in front of it so that the
whole thing was in complete and absolute chaos.
Press: My goodness.
Johnson: And, um, that is my only actual memory of the earthquake at Stanford. I
remember hearing the stories of this, you may believe if you wish to, I heard these stories
of the shocking building that had been put up by Mr. Latham. That the buildings of the
original Stanford arcades had stood relatively unharmed, they had withstood the

10

earthquake. But the buildings put up by Mr. Latham later were found to be a shell rock
filled with rubble.
Press: That’s accurate. That’s exactly true, and that’s documented. That’s absolutely
correct.
Johnson: That I remember being shocked by terribly.
Press: So was everyone.
Johnson: Well, a ten year old child you wouldn’t think would be thinking about it, but I
guess everybody was horrified.
Press: That’s part of learning. Excuse me, do you remember how soon after the quake
you got out there? Was it in a couple of days that you walked out with your father?
Johnson: Oh, I think so, yet. I don’t think it could’ve been the day after because the word
came down from San Francisco that hordes of desperate people were sweeping down the
peninsula. And that all food was going to be seized and that we were going to have
terrible times. And, of course everybody was living out on their lawns and that seemed
pretty ominous. And I remember father went and took a [inaudible] bag that had come
from the Sierra club trip, and went down town to get food. And he was a little late in
doing it, and more practical people had got there first. And, he came home with a bag full
of dry cereals. Well, our family didn’t eat dry cereals under ordinary circumstances. So,
this bag of dry cereals had to be worked out over months and months and months. Mother
was completely desperate at the idea of so much dry cereal. But, it was carefully hidden
in the cellar way back under things where people (even if they were desperately hungry)
usually wouldn’t find it.
Press: Yeah. Excuse me, let’s back off a minute. You had mentioned earlier a trip up to
the Sierras. Was that before….
Johnson: That 2as [inaudible] and four…
Press: Could you tell me a little more about how that came about?
Johnson: I don’t actually know how father and mother happened to make the trip. I don’t
know the background of that. I have a mass of father and mother’s letters that I haven’t
read. And I find all sorts of interesting things there, but that I don’t know. But, I do know
that somewhere [inaudible] when I was 8 we went to the Sierra club. Mother had made a
little tent, and we had three [inaudible] bags and 3 heavy sleeping bags and went up a
week early….I don’t know anything about the trip until we left Fresno by stage.
Press: Did you go by…excuse me, did you go by stage from Palo Alto or train?
Johnson: I don’t remember at all.
11

Press: Ok.
Johnson: But I do remember driving up in the foothills towards Wowonna, and through
those lovely yellow hills and spotted trees here and there. And, staying at the old
Wowonna hotel overnight and wondering around there. Then, I remember two incidents,
three very vividly going into Yosemite. One was I hadn’t slept well and I was cross and
was making everybody completely miserable with my complaints apparently. And the
driver said, “I can do something about this if you let me.” And mother said she would let
him. And, so we set the stage coach to a stop, and the driver got out and he took me out
with him, and, he took me to the back of the stage coach and like, it had the, the body of
the coach was a box. And, he had me put my hand on the edge of the box at the back.
This was a dusty road. Then he got back in and started to whip up the horses. And, he
said, “You just run.” And, he did it so fast that I didn’t have time to make an adequate
protest. But, we started, and I ran in the dust and I don’t doubt yelling and screaming for
a while, but then with no energy you don’t yell and scream. And after a while we
stopped. And, he came around and said, “Do you want to sit up next to me?” And, I said,
“Yes, I did.” And so I sat next to him holding the reins right behind his hands helping
him ride the coach into Yosemite.
Press: What a thrill! And, you learned your lesson.
Johnson: Well, I learned how to handle myself in the presence of that driver, I’d say.
Then there were two other things I remember on that trip. One was a little glade, an open
glade on the right hand side of the stagecoach with a green little lawn like area in which a
mountain blue jay, one of the lovely crested bluejays, was eating a gold finch it was still
alive. Tearing at its flesh and the gold finch was protesting in loud tones. And until this
day I look at a Jay and I know that it is beautiful, but I have no affection for it.
Press: I would think not.
Johnson: And, the other was driving by a bank, and a large rattle snack struck from the
bank and hit the side of the stage coach just against the box so that it fell to the ground
instead of into the stage coach.
Press: My Goodness.
Johnson: And that depressed me very much.
Press: How…do you remember or have any idea of how long your family stayed up
there? Did you stay for the whole summer?
Johnson: No, no. We were there a week and camped in one of the public camp grounds,
and uh, I remember two things about that. Very funny. One was the bears wandering
around. That bothered me very much. I felt bears were not friendly, and I still feel that
way. But, the other was waking in the middle of the night to wild screams. And, scared to
12

pieces and father said, “Oh, don’t [inaudible] between father and mother in the sleeping
bags.” Father said, “Oh, don’t worry about that. That’s just the mountain lions. And, that
was the summer, 1904, when Roosevelt finally decided that he was going to do
something about the sheep herders, these big sheep men that were defying his rule that
there should be no more grazing near Yosemite national park because they were ruining
the meadows. And, um, he had, um, made it, made this rule as law that there should be no
grazing I the park and all the sheep herders had done is simply go buy little used trails
and get the sheep in other ways where nobody had saw them, and it was going right on as
it had before. But, this summer Roosevelt ordered that the troops scatter the flocks, seize
and imprison the shepherds, and kill as many of the sheep as could be used for food. And
two carcasses of sheep skin that were all ready to be butchered had been given to the
Sierra Club, and they’d taken a little sapling tree and latched it between to bigger trees
and hung these carcasses from the little sapling. And the mountain lion was frustrated. It
could smell the meet but couldn’t get to it. And, it was protesting. And, I heard so many
times down the years that mountain lions were mute. And, I remembered those screams.
Then, one day when we were, my two sons and a cousin, fourth of July we were in the
Philadelphia zoo and big lion house, long lion house, we walked up along one side of it
and down the other. And, we came up on California cougar, and he was looking so
dispirited, his eyes were half closed, he was sitting there so desolate and lonely. I said
I’m going to give him greetings from California. And, I stepped-up to the front of the
cage, and I went makes mountain lion sound. He came to life, his tail began lashing, his
lip came back and he began roaring for all he was worth. Screaming just the way it
happened in the Sierra. And, then keepers came rushing from all sides. And they said,
“What did you do? This animal is just frantic back there.” I said, “I just gave him
greetings from California.” And, they looked at me and they said, “Get out of here!” So, I
got out of there. That was in the days that the elephant boy was famous in Philadelphia
zoo.
Press: Oh yes.
Johnson: And, my children wished to see the elephant boy, and it was getting late in the
afternoon. And, we asked our way to the elephant boy, and they said we’re just through
the lion’s cage. And I said, “Well, I don’t know.” But, my cousin, my father’s cousin
really was a very large woman, and I said I’d walk to the other side of you with the two
boys on in front and one behind me and perhaps the lion won’t see me. Well, we notice
that when we got to the far end of the cage with the lion, no sooner than when we stepped
through that door the scream started again.
Press: That is a…
Johnson: He did not like me, there’s no doubt about it. And, um….
Press: That is astounding!
Johnson: Yes, it is astounding.

13

Press: Animals are remarkable with what they can remember.
Johnson: They’re intent is like or dislike. I’m afraid it was dislike in this case.
Press: Glad the lion was in a cage. Well, that must have been quite an experience up at
Yosemite for an 8 year old girl. Were there a lot of other children up there at the time?
Johnson: No, there were no other children at all. And, the reaction of the other Sierra
Clubbers was very adverse, and there was a lot of talk about bringing babies out into the
club and that sort of thing, A lot of muttering. I heard, father and mother heard. And,
father and mother decided they were to do what they could to put an end to this. So, they
were going to climb glacier point, Mr. [inaudible] was going to lead a trip up to glacier
point. And, father and mother signed-up for it. And, I signed-up for it, and we went up to
glacier point. And, of course as a child I went up and came back again. I went back and
forth and back and forth and got to the top, completely risky and was absolutely
unwinded when many of the members who had been very critical were huffing and
puffing. And, there was no more talk about babies after that. And we were sitting on the
great escarpment on the top. The sliding [inaudible] the glaciated top there. And, um, Mr.
Colbie was talking about the formation of the valley when two college age boys came
running down and set their feet and went scooting on the [inaudible] you know. And, I
remembered this day so vividly, the lecture Mr. Colbie gave them, he just took them apart
and he said, “Let me assure you that it makes no difference where we are. If this sort of
thing happens again, I shall have a Packer take you out of the camp, take you from the
valley immediately, now remember this.” And, that was the end of that. And, I
recognized authority when I saw it.
Press: Well, authority is needed at times. You know, I was just reading a piece last night
in the Stanford historical society bulletin about Camp Curry, and did you ever meet
Professor Curry? He was about the time your father was at Stanford, and he went up to
Yosemite and started the camp.
Johnson: Yes, I remember that. We stayed at Camp Curry once or twice during my young
years, and I was in a fencing class at Stanford with Margery Curry. And, I remembered
one incident. You can also delete this if you want to, um I was shocked my cousin was a
Theta, Margery Curry was a Theta, and I heard that she ordered boxes of apples from a
grocery company and had them under her bed at the sorority house, charged them to her
family and sold them to her sorority sisters for ten cents a piece.
Press: Well, there are lots of ways to work your way through Stanford.
Johnson: I doubt that she was working way through Stanford.
Press: I doubt it, too.
Johnson: And I was deeply impressed by [inaudible] Curry being run out of the valley.

14

Press: Yeah…
Johnson: Finally…
Press: Stop just a second. Let’s end this tape right here because we’re nearly at the end of
the tape and the interview will continue on the other side.

[End of Tape 86, Side A]

[Tape 86, Side B]
Press: Just one thought about the earthquake, I almost forgot. I see over there by your
fireplace a, there a piece of a mosaic about a foor-square which looks as if it might have
come off the church, is it a bits that broke off during the earthquake?
Johnson: My husband was a geologist at Stanford as you probably know, and he had been
on a trip with Valdimar Lingrin, the head of the geological survey in Washington, which
is a story by itself. And he loved geology so much that he then decided that he would
come down to Stanford. I don't know the ends and outs of it, how he arranged it with his
family, but he just took a train and came to Stanford. And, that was the time that Stanford
was hunting for their boys and you could get into Stanford. And, he was very happy there
for a year. Then, his father who had a very terrible Civil War wound, died as a result of
the slug that was in his lung for so long. And, he had to put himself, how he had to put
himself through school, which he did by working six months for the geological survey,
and then working six months for his, at Stanford. It didn't divide exactly to six months,
but a long vacation one semester her worked for the geological survey. And, um, he was
at Stanford the time of the earthquake. And, was with Dr. Jordon walking along side of
the quad there, when Dr. Jordon made his famous remark about legacy. I guess it was all
very well in the abstract but no good int he concrete. And, I remembered it very vividly.
He was also one of those that did the work along the fault recording the effects. And, in
one of the earthquake books there is a picture of a fence that was offset three or four feet
with a young man standing there, and that was my husband standing there. And, at the
time of the earthquake of course they were tearing up the rubble in front of the church,
and simply taking the mosaic and cutting it off and dumping it. Of course, in my day, and
I think still all over the Stanford residences you can see chunks of mosaic out in the
gardens.
Press: Yes.
Johnson: And Harry did pick this up at that time. And, has always loved it and has always
been very much a part of our home. And, when I was moving up here, we had these
statues and things appraised by a man who used to be the chief of appraisal for
*inaudible* in Los Angeles so he's a man of knowledge and reputation. And, he
appraised this, I didn't ask him to I asked him to do the statues in the living room, but he
decided other things should be appraised too so he appraised them. And, this he put at
1500 dollars as a piece of, a very beautiful piece of Roman mosaic. And, um, that
interested me tremendously because if I remember this story, the mosaics were made in
Morano, which of course is ancient. And, when the church had been shaken down and
they were asked whether they still had the design you know, they repeated it and put it up
again. But, here they came from an area that must have been making mosaic in Roman
times I judge....
Press: For centuries....

16

Johnson: And, um, here the highly skilled appraiser thought it was a Roman mosaic. And,
uh, I asked him about it. I told him this story of the mosaic and he looked astonished and
said, "Well, it's that sort of thing that makes appraisal fun." And laughed it off.
Press: Well, uh, as a little girl when you were growing-up where did you go to school?
Did you go to school in Palo Alto?
Johnson: I went to Harker School...
Press: You went to Harker School?
Johnson: This Harker's was a big old red building that's still there on the east side of
Bryant between Lincoln and Kingsley.
Press: Is it part of Castille now or is that still separate?
Johnson: No, it's a separate school. They're a rival school. And the house next to us on
Ramona, on the corner of Ramona and Lincoln, was used as a supplementary school
building. It had school rooms and so on. And Mrs. Harker, a short lady with great
authority, used to live in that building and was the head of some of the classes...and I
think that she was the only adult I was really afraid of. She was very severe, and she
certainly had my number. She had me completely in control, under control. And, the
morning of the earthquake after the actual shaking had stopped we all rushed out onto the
front lawns. And, out came Mrs. Harker. A miniature replica of Queen Victoria with a
long flannel night gown on, long sleeves with little ruffles at the cuff and a little tight
collar with a ruffle around the neck, and her very sparse hair in little tiny braids sticking
out at the side. And, she came in her bare feet, nubbly old feet, flying across the lawn and
threw her arms around my father and burst into tears and said, "Oh, Dr. Roth, Dr. Roth
what are we to do? And I stood there and looked at her, and I thought to myself, "hmph."
And, I never was afraid of Mrs. Harker again.
Press: She turned out to be a human being.
Johnson: Perfectly human.
Press: Oh goodness.
Johnson: The, I went to the school of *inaudible* next, right, you know there were
blockards where we live. Then after we moved up under the hills, you know by the old
Sharon house, we had a horse named Scoocum, and I used to drive down dropping father
down somewhere along the university.
Press: You rode the horse?
Johnson: Yeah. Not riding driving. And, I would go to Ms. Harker's school, which was
then out towards the bay and I don't know exactly where it was. And, unharness the
17

horse, tie him up, and at the end of the school day I would harness him again and go
home.
Press: What did you have? I don't know what they're called, a little buggy of some sort?
Johnson: Yes, *inaudible* and...
Press: Was it a two wheel?
Johnson: No. It was a four wheel and two seats. And you just went *jog jog jog*, and the
horse was named Scoocum, which was supposed to be the Indian word for good. And he
was good in that he, well he did what you wanted if it agreed with what he wanted. And
he liked to go galloping over the heels when the grass was green. In the spring time when
I got to climb on his back and go with him, and we had a lovely time.
Press: And this was near the Sharon Estate, was that out by Portolla?
Johnson: No, that's out where Sand Hill road is...
Press: Oh, Sand Hill Road, that's where Sharon Estates is...it's right there.
Johnson: It's about a quarter of a mile north near the old Sharon house, the big old Sharon
house...and father and some other men together had bought 40 acres of land in there.
Absolutely nothing but smooth heels.
Press: Must've been beautiful. I drove out this morning, I was looking at the heels after
all this rain, they were so deeply, richly velvety green. And then there were so few homes
that there must've been some much gorgeous....
Johnson: There wasn't a thing visible, not one thing except a little farm way up back in
the San Mateo area...
Press: Great for growing-up...
Johnson: Yes, wonderful, could wander anywhere and get into no real trouble unless you
ran up on a rattlesnake who wasn't expecting you.
Press: And when your father came to work, did you drop him off with a *inaudible*
Johnson: I dropped him off many times, and often he would walk down by himself, he
walked down and across the bridges *inaudible* and uh, he and Mr. Bundon were great
friends. I think that Bundon used to use father to sort of thrash out his ideas. He would
come walking up to our house and they would go back to my father's to study, which was
way, it was a house around the court and way off in the backside was father's study. And
there voices would come out, oh forever, believe me.

18

Press: Goodness, I didn't remember. Did you build the house or have it built?
Johnson: Well, I realized just recently from a picture I just found in mother's paper, it was
a picture of my birthday in April in 1905, which was a year before the earthquake, and of
a picnic of a birthday party up on the hills. The lovely, sweet beautiful hills all around,
not a building in site. So they were thinking of moving before the earthquake came, and
then after the earthquake came, very quickly built a very low house of wood out there
under the white oak trees and we lived there until 1910 or 11, I guess it was late '10 when
father left.
Press: Yeah, uh, then uh as you continued growing up, did you, was Mrs. Harker a high
school? Did you continue going to high school there?
Johnson: Ms. Harker, yes, yes, but that was later. I went to the grade school, and then for
the 7th and 8th grade father and mother sent me back to live with my grandparents in
Concord, Massachusetts, that's where I was born. And, uh, I was an uninhibited Western
child and used to playing all sorts of boys games, including football and riding bareback
and all that sort of thing, and it was a very traumatic experience fitting into an ultracorrect New England background. Luckily, my grandmother was a very wise
discriminating person, and she sort of supported me through the whole thing. One of the
early days at the school, this was 8th grade, I had a very marvelous teacher and we were
out in the school yard, girls yard boys yard, playing drop the handkerchief, which is a
game I don't think 8th grade children should be playing. Anyway, it wasn't my game, and
then from the boys side of the yard came a football soaring over, landed near me, and I
grabbed it, I was familiar with footballs, and a little boy came running over and he tried
to get it away from me. He tried to pound it up he tried to pound it down, he couldn't get
it. And, he was very discouraged he didn't know what to do with this type of situation.
And, he walked back to the boy’s yard, and I kicked it. I had always been a very good
drop kick gal, and it went soaring up over the tree and back into the boys' yard. And then
we went on playing drop the handkerchief. And when I got home that afternoon, my
grandmother met me at the front door, and the queer smile on her face, and she said,
"Livy, did you kick a football at school today?" And I said, "Yes, it was a good kick,
too." Nothing ever, no more ever said about it.
Press: Ah, what a beautiful story. I bet she was so proud of you.
Johnson: She had a noble wicked twinkle in her eye.
Press: Oh, good. When you went back there to Concord did you go across the country by
yourself or did you parents go with you on the trip?
Johnson: No, I went by myself.
Press: On the train?
Johnson: Yeah
19

Press: What an experience that must have been.
Johnson: Yes, I don't remember the trip across at all. But, I remember very vividly the
trip back. My grandmother I guess, anyway, somebody had wanted to have me put in
charge of the conductor of the train. And father said, "No, she can take care of herself.
But, nobody knows what kind of man the conductor is." And, I had relatives in Chicago
and they met me, you always had to change in Chicago in those days.
Press: Question, you have a wonderful memory, do you remember the name of the coach
in Chicago by which you changed stations?
Johnson: No.
Press: Parmalade, do you remember that?
Johnson: Yes I do!
Press: I remember the few time as a kid at 7 years old, I went back, I had my grandfather
lived in Chicago, and it's always the Parmalade coach from one station to another.
Forever.
Johnson: Forever. I don't think we used to use it very often because we had relatives and
we always used to stop and go out the old park and stay with them. But from there on, it
got a little dull, it got a little long. And, I remember so vividly the station where there was
a beautiful pawn just outside each station, and a rail fence, you know like the *inaudible*
fences. I climbed, and there was good gravel by it, wonderful gravel fro skipping stones.
And I was merely skipping stones and I looked-up and noticed the train was moving. And
I climbed through the rail fence and climbed through the observation car. So then I
managed to climb in and walk up to the car and buy a seat where my pocket bocket and
my ticket and the rest of my things were. Then the only other thing I remember about the
trip was coming through needles and down into California and with the golden area
again, there I sat at the window with tears running down my face. Just the perfect baby
because I was back in the golden heels again.
Press: How long were you back east? Two years?
Johnson: Just one year.
Press: One year. How happy you must've been to get home.
Johnson: Just wonderful.
Press: Then did you attend Mrs. Harker's high school?

20

Johnson: The year after that, I, we went to England. And it was England, and Switzerland
and Geneva and all sorts of places. And, I had French and went to Guild of Handicraft
and Chipping Camden.
Press: Chipping Camden? We were there last summer and stayed overnight.
Johnson: It's a lovely Place.
Press: What a beautiful little town.
Johnson: Where did you stay?
Press: What a minute now. Right in the center of town is the old market place.
Johnson: Was a market place...
Press: Yeah, still there. And, uh, we stayed at a place down towards the church on this
side of the street. A yellow church there, uh, a big old church. And it was in a bed and
breakfast place...and I don't remember the name of it right now.
Johnson: Well, you didn't stay at one of the inns....did you go and see the Statler Hall by
chance?
Press: No, not one of the inns....YES!
Johnson: That's where we lived.
Press: You lived in Statler Hall?
Johnson: Yes, for 15 months.
Press: Really? And that was a residency then, huh?
Johnson: Yes.
Press: For goodness sake.
Johnson: Owned by Mr. Ashby, he was a friend of my father's. And who father brought
from Stanford to lecture.
Press: That is incredible. We did a, uh, we stayed in London my wife in I last month and
we wanted to go to the *inaudible* and somebody had mentioned the town Moorse
Beyond Marsh or something like that, my wife called it "Puddle Beyond Marsh." And,
uh, we went there and it wasn't very interesting and we decided let's go somewhere else.
And, we set on a bus that happened to be the last bus out of town and we found Chipping
Campden. And we just fell in love with it, and we stayed almost two days there walking
21

around having a wonderful time. And we indeed did spend, oh about two or three hours
at, what's the name?
Johnson: Wool Staplers.
Press: Wool Staplers, which is a museum now.
Johnson: Is it? I didn't know that.
Press: Yes, it's a museum and it's sort of like a library and it's run by the city and by the
towns people.
Johnson: That's wonderful.
Press: Yeah, it was so nice.
Johnson: We and mister Ashby had bought an inaudible and turned it into a residence and
was living there and father had gotten touch with him about a possible rental, and Ashby
said that he was reconstructing a place bought in Campden named the Norman Chapel
and that he would be moving to that because they had a baby coming and wanted their
own room and so it was arranged that when they do we should have an inaudible. Ashby
was doubtful about when we would be able to get out of Wools Acres and a code was
setup and he would table to father just 1 word, Athens, and that would mean that
something was delaying things and that we would not be able to have the Wools Acre
before Christmas. And when the cable Athens came, the plans were changed and we went
and spent the Winter in Munich and went and stays at Wools Acres in the spring. And
were there over one year in the following summer. But it was a marvelous experience,
and a very beautiful home in many ways but it was really pretty hard to live in in some
ways because it was on the low side of the Campden Creek, and when the heavy rain
came the water simply ran down the long back passage way, down behind the dining
room. Down the stone paved passageway. There, through the passage that went through
the dining room into the kitchen. Through the kitchen, through the scullery, through the
laundry and out the back door. And, uh, that was inconvenient. And, then the whole
dining room area where the great ingle fireplace was, was paved in stone, floored in stone
and with a change of weather that would sweat. So, if you used a handkerchief watch if
the handkerchief came up damp off the floor. And, everybody, the only time in all our
lives we, any of this, *inaudible* all had *inaudible*. It was perfectly miserable. They
had mattresses, square mattresses, and pillows either side of the ingle fire place. And, you
could sit there reading, look up the chimney and see the stars. And, it would be warm and
comfortable but that was about the only places that you were warm and comfortable.
Press: Well, the old Staplers Hall has not changed at all. It still has the staircases going all
sorts of directions. Narrow staircases and narrow doors, and uh, it is a lovely museum
now. And, uh, I know it was just down the road as you looked down the front door of
*inaudible* staplers, it was just down, the church is down here, our inn where we stayed
is almost across the street. Just on the upside of the street. But, it's a fairly new place, at
22

least remodeled. I know it was remodeled. How was the, what was the purpose of the trip
that your father took overseas? To study? To do research? Was it about culture?
Johnson: Well, this, they *inaudible* at Stanford had finally come to an end, you know.
Press: Oh, this is after 1911...Oh I see we jumped ahead I didn't realize that no this is
1911, we are way ahead. Oh, I see. Let's go with that for a minute and we'll come back to
it. Just one more interjection here before...How did you happen to go to Chipping
Campden? Do you know?
Johnson: Oh, simply father's friendship with Mr. Ashby
Press: Oh, I see. He knew him there and that was a good place to be?
Johnson: Yes, yes.
Press: Well, after, uh you graduated, I presume you graduated high school from Mrs.
Harkers...
Johnson: Well, what happened was we came back from this three years abroad where I,
well, when we went to Campden, they people, upper crust people, and it was very
definitely upper crust in those days. For instance a doctor bought his practice, and it was
unethical to call a doctor from any other practice.
Press: I see.
Johnson: And, I adore strawberries and wonderful strawberries were raised around
Chipping Campden, and mother served them a lot and I got hives, and they were very
much alarmed and sent for Doctor Duehurse. Well, Dr. Duehurse came and laughed, and
he said that it was strawberries and to just keep me in bed and feed me carefully so on
and so forth. And he came without having been asked or called, he came every day
bringing with him a box of strawberries from his own garden. And so father finally told
him after a week or so that we no longer needed his services. And, uh, it was becoming
very expensive you know, these daily visits.
Press: Sure....
Johnson: But it was an archaic time. It was an epidemic of scarlet fever. And, um, no
quarantine. No quarantine whatsoever, which was a very tense time for us. But, when we
came back I was of an age to go to college but I didn't have the college credits. And,
father went to Mrs. Harker and asked to ask her to make an exception. Of course, they
had long years of friendship. And then, she did. And, I lived with my Uncle Charles
Wing in Palo Alto, Professor Wing, and walked every morning to Ms. Harker's school
and back, did mighty little else but study. And, uh, I took 8 subjects. Two seemed
easy...fourth grade French, uh, fourth year French and English. And then beginning
German and Beginning Latin. Um, I'd never had Latin but of course I'd picked-up some
23

German in Munich. And, uh, knitted up the 15 units to enter Stanford in that one year and
entered in the 500, the 500 girls.
Press: What year did you enter Stanford?
Johnson: 1914.
Press: 1914.
Johnson: No, 1913.
Press: 1913.
Johnson: And had the one year because I knew I was going to be married in September of
1915. And I remember going to *inaudible* to town and he was telling me the great
honor that has been done me in being allowed to come to Stanford, being one of the 500
and he hoped that I would make four years at Stanford, make myself a worthy Stanford
graduate and I sat there and said, "Oh yes sir, yes sir." Knowing darn well that I'd only be
there one year, one college year. But it was a very interesting experience and father had
done cleverly arranged for me to take Dr. Angel's psychology, which was a junior course.
Just a yes or no course. And that's, that's something I've used all my life. It's been a
tremendous eye opener.
Press: Why don't we, we've been going for 45 minutes. Why don't we stop right there
because we've come to sort of a stopping place, the start of Stanford is a good stopping
place. And, we've been going 45 minutes and I don't like to go much longer than that. So,
why don't we just end it right here and pick it up the next time we meet? Is that alright?
Conclusion of Session number 2 with Mrs. Johnson. I will end this cassette here, the uh,
interview will continue on a new cassette.
[End of Tape 86, Side B]

24

[Beginning of Tape 87, Side A]
Press: Third interview with Mrs. Johnson, it takes place at her home on Friday, April 2nd,
Press: Last time we had just to get you up to the point where you are about to enter
Stanford and, uh, There is one other thing I wanted we wanted to get back to, and i want
to get back to without, before I forget and that was your trips up to the Sierra when your
little girl. I don't think we ever covered that, was that just family or was Stanford people
too or...
Johnson: No, I think it was just family. Father and mother had always been interested in
that sort of thing. And I really don't know how the first contact was made. A child of
eight doesn't know these things, you.
Press: Come to think of it, I think we did talk about it because I sort of remember talking
about Camp Curry Yosemite didn't we?
Johnson: Yes.
Price: Right.
Johnson: But my knowledge of Yosemite comes later. I mean we talked Camp Curry, I
didn't know anything about it at that time.
Press: Well, anyway, alright then. Let's talk about you going to Stanford, uh, how did you
you're going to stanford how did you decide that you were going to stanford or was there
ever a question?
Johnson: I don't think there was ever any question. But, um, I remember so vividly the
first time I saw my future husband we were sleeping on the lawn, in Palo Alto after the
earthquale, and the boys went by in couples with guns over their shoulders and we
realized that one of the men that was patroling around our district in fron of the house
was Harry *inaudible*
Press: Who's, who? I'm Sorry.
Johnson: Harry Johnson. That was my first memory of my husband. Of course he was
devoted to Stanford and father was very devoted to Stanford. I don't think that there was
ever any doubt about going to Stanford.
Press: And that's the first time you saw the man who was going to be your future
husband?
Johnson: Yes, that's the first time that I remember. And he was very much part of our life
and *inaudible*

25

Press: Was he a Palo Alto boy?
Johnson: No, he was born in Washington DC...
Press: Oh, I see.
Johnson: And lived in the same apartment house as Vladamir Lyngron, head of the
geological survey.

Press: I see...
Johnson: He was a little boy when ever Saturday to Rock Creek Park to do Geology.
`And the Vladamir Lygron just moved into the apartment house.
Press: Excuse me, may I re..do you remember how to spell Vladamir Lyngron?
Johnson: Nope.
Press: Ok. We'll get it`.
Johnson: He was there for years of geological service *inaudible*
Press: We can get it, yeah.
Johnson: Yeah.
Johnson: Anyway, this strange man was in the elevator and said, "You are the geologist
to this little boy? You have a geologist pick I see." I said, "He's very interested in
geology." And, then I took Dr. Lyngron to Rock Creek Park to show him how to find
garnets. And, then he found that this *inaudible* definitely knew more about geology
than he did. But he'd always been interested in it and very tied up in earth sciences that
sort of thing though he went through all his schooling in Washington DC, and when he
came out with Lyngron to work as a *inaudible* in the camp, and, uh, fell in love with
geology which was always at the Stanford which he wanted to go, I just don't know why.
Press: I see. He came out with Mr. Lyngron to California...
Johnson: He came out, no, to Hamilton. To Montana....
Press: Oh....Hamilton, Montanta.
Johnson: But how it happened to be Stanford I haven't the slightest idea. But it was, that's
where you went for geology. And he worked very hard. His father died after the first year
of Stanford, he died just about graduation time in the spring of Harrry's first year. And,
that meant that Harry had to support himself and mainly support his mother, and get
26

himself through college. And, he did it by working long summers *tape froze and
skipped*
Press: Isn't that excellent?
Johnson: But he put himself through college that way, and as he said they finally had to
shake him out and get rid of him.
Press: He was about ready to graduate at that time?
Johnson: Yes, and they gave him their degrees....
Press: Well, in just this year...
Johnson: 1906
Press: Yeah, 1906, uh, it just happened we're almost at the earthquake anniversary.
Johnson: Yes, 18th of April.
Press: I should have brought you the paper because I have a long story in there from a
young man who was a freshman, who was living in Encina. He's now 95, and he's
reminiscing about the earthquake. I'll put it in the mail to you.
Johnson: I'd love to see it.
Press: Oh yeah. Well, you entered Stanford as a fresh person? And you lived in Roble I
guess?
Johnson: No. My father and mother, we'd come back from Europe two years before and
father and mother had spent one year in the east, and then they came out to Palo Alto and
rented a little house up on Palo Alto Avenue because they knew I was going to get
married and we want, they wanted to have that year together. And, uh, I walked from
Middlefield Road in Palo Alto to the university every day. And, it was in those days you
left your books out on the window ledge somewhere and simply ran to the Chemistry
building to the History, and that sort of thing. I don't know what you still do or not, I
guess you have bicycles now don't you?
Press: Most students ride bicycles, yes, I do, too. Well, did you...you met Harry before
you entered Stanford I take it...
Johnson: Oh yes, I was just a child.
Press: Yes, I see. When you met him?
Johnson: Yeah.
27

Press: But when you entered Stanford you're pretty, you know you were going to marry
him at that point?
Johnson: Oh yes, yes. I was engaged. My father wouldn't allow me to be engaged until I
became 18. We had been sure long before that.
Press: I see, so he was just then getting ready to graduate and you were just entering, is
that right?
Johnson: Yes, he was 15 years older than I was.
Press: Oh, I see.
Johnson: Which had tremendous advantages in the beginning because you could start out
living right away, you didn't have to scratch around until you got a nest egg.
Press: Yeah, that's right.
Johnson: But it does...not so good with the end, is it?
Press: No, no that's true. Well, there are good parts and parts with everything. Did, uh,
you finish a year at Stanford or did you...
Johnson: I finished the year, and father had, uh, guided me into various courses. I had Dr.
Angels course in psychology, which I thought...I think it's one of the most wonderful
things I ever did. He was marvelous, and that was a junior course, but father talked me
into it. And I had, um, History and, which I don't remember well. I remember learning it
and thinking that an awful lot of American History is pretty silly. And Chemistry with
Chris Mitchell, who was very deaf, and he used to ask embarrassing questions about
Harry who is his fraternity brother, in a very loud tone of voice in the middle of the
Chemistry lab. *inaudible*
Press: Oh my goodness. Well now, what, you lived at home during your freshman year as
you say. So you walk to school every day...
Johnson: Yes, I walk to school, and then I was invited to go down, Palo Alto had a
tournament, and I don't know how it came about or what came about it. But, they put on a
performance of Midsummer Night's Dream, in which I acted Hermia and I had a very
good time. Then we had friends, the Deongoolos, who were quite famous in that time and
lived in Carmel and moved to Carmel. And, Carrie Deongoolo told George Sterling,
when they were putting on a performance of Midsummer Night's Dream in the
*inaudible* theatre, they couldn't find a Hermia, so they carried Deongolo and told Mr.
Sterling, well I know a good Hermia so see if you can get her. And, I was invited to go
down to Forest Theatre and play Hermia. And I asked father, "What do I do, daddy?"
And he said, "Well, you will go to each of your professors and you will ask them if you
28

are doing good enough work to be given two weeks absence if you take your books with
you and work on it." So, I did that, and they said, "Oh sure, go along." I just had a
marvelous, wonderful time in Carmel for two weeks.
Press: Isn't that great?
Johnson: It was an extraordinary experience. Very amusing story, but they're not about
Stanford.
Press: Well, what was life like at that time? That was 1906 when you entered Stanford?
Johnson: No, 1913, 1914 was the time. 1906 was the earthquake.
Press: Well 1914?
Johnson: Yes, I entered Stanford in 1914.
Press: Oh, excuse me, ok. What was, there were 500 women there as you said? What was
life like for freshman at that time when there was social life and...
Johnson: I didn't join a sorority, and several of my friends did. It was a little chaotic for
me. And, uh, Harry was very still very close to his fraternity brothers, and, uh, he um had
only lived a considerable amount of time and he had finally found the girl he wanted to
marry and he hand no debt or any interference. So, whenever I would chatter in a letter or
on the phone to tell him I was going to a party to meet this awfully nice boy named "so
and so" and "so and so," he would take the train out, and be here for that weekend.
Press: From where?
Johnson: From Los Angeles, and supervise the whole thing. So my college year was a
little lopsided. It was not a typical college year.
Press: I see. Well you had a fiancé'....
Johnson: I had a fiancé', and one that was quite grip, he was not going to lose out at all.
He didn't have any danger of losing out, but then he wasn't thinking...
Press: He wanted to make sure...
Johnson: Yes.
Press: Well, there's no doubt about it. So your year was a little bit different. Did you
participate in any activities on the campus, any athletics or activities or anything like
that? Theatre? Singing?

29

Johnson: Well, yes I participated; I took fencing for one thing. That's where I knew
Marjorie Curry with the apples under the bed; she sold for 10 cents to her sorority sisters.
Well, uh, I didn't do, I didn't do very much in terms of Stanford. I was busy with Palo
Alto things but not too much with Stanford.
Press: And, marriage was on your mind so...
Johnson: Very much on my mind, yes.
Press: When did you get married?
Johnson: In September.
Press: Of 1915?
Johnson: Of 1915. September 6, 1915, and we were married in the Stanford Chapel by
Dr. Gardner, and the, our best, Harry's best man was David Ellis, and he was a very
marvelous architect in Southern California. And the most charming, affable, gracious
gentleman. A lovely, lovely person. And he was standing out, and everyone was getting
ready in the quarters, I suppose the Chaplin's quarters I don't know, there at the church
and he was standing by the front door, just kind of seeing how everything was going. And
the students were just registering that week, and lots of students were going by with
books in their arms, you know, and he was standing there opening the door and they
would stop and say, "What's happening? What's going on." And he'd say, "There's going
to be a wedding in a few minutes and it's going to be lovely. Lots of rum, why don't you
come in?" So, the back part of the church had a great many students there with books in
their arms.
Press: How nice. That's, that's great.
Johnson: But it was a very nice place to be married.
Press: I would think so. I want to talk a little bit more, certainly more about your life with
your husband traveling, but, do you remember much about, um, the dispute that your
father had with David Star Jordon that led to his leaving the university? It was when you
were a little girl of course, but did you know anything about it, could you tell me
anything about it?
Johnson: No, uh, I was sent to live with my grandfather and grandmother in Concord,
Massachusetts and that would have been as I figure it out now, that would have been the
year that all of this was going on.
Press: 1910? 1909 or 1910?
Johnson: Yeah, because, um, I don't remember. I was young. I didn't know about it at the
time.
30

Press: Oh sure. You wouldn't be likely too.
Johnson: No, and I always wondered sort of vaguely why they sent me there. And, I had
thought it was probably as a western kid humping onto a horse and going to where I
chose, driving myself from the Sharon Estate to Ms. Harker school, um, and doing what I
though best to do on the way down and on the way home, uh, I realize looking back that
I had become a very independent young whipper snapper, and I thought that possibly sent
me to be with grandmother and grandfather, where I had a lovely time, but it was very
sobering because western, eastern children didn't bathe the way I liked to be bathed. And,
I had thought it was for that they had sent me. But recently, my sister and I have been
trying to develop a little life of my father, and as we worked over it, and she told me
some memories of the year that I was away that she had, I realize that probably they sent
me partly because this trouble was boiling up. Because Beatrice remembers coming down
with our horse and buggy, and stopping where we'd go way down to "inaudible*, is that
the road that *inaudible*?
Press: Mhm, yeah, *inaudible*...
Johnson: Yeah, and I think that's where the mailbox was. And they stop and got the mail,
and she remembers my face *tape skips* and looking through the mail and said, "It's
come Birtha." And I didn't know what had come. But, she said that she remembered it
vividly now that because father's voices were different. *tape skips* They were going, we
were going to Europe for two to three years, but then I was to come home for a last
summer at the house there. As the years have gone by, and I have talked with different
people and though about it, dug into that whole thing *tape skips*, and I, we wrote a
three of four page history of my father that I have a copy of, would you like *tape skips*?
There's an extra copy in there *tape skips* Um, he was a very, he was not a religious
person, but I never knew a person who lived so completely and so devotedly by the
golden rule. And, he was outraged by injustice. And, I know that he felt a great injustice
had been done, and Dr. *inaudible* had been fired, too, wasn't it? Dr. *inaudible*. And
that he felt that Gerbils idea, Gerbil's side of the story should be heard. And, then he
called a meeting at his house with various people to hear what Dr. Gerbil's had to say.
And that was what terribly enraged Dr. Jordon.
Press: Before I came over here, before we first started talking I went to the archives and
read Gido Marx's report, which I'm sure you've seen.
Johnson: I haven't, I would like very much to see it.
Press: You haven't? I'll see that you do.
Johnson: I'd like to see it very much.
Press: Yeah, I will, I'll make a note and I'll get that to you.

31

Johnson: How long is it? How big is it?
Press: Well, the portion that refers to your father is maybe, I think it's a couple of places,
maybe a total of 10 or 12 type written pages. I took notes on it, and I think that I can get
copies made because I...I'll get it. I'll see that you do.
Johnson: I would be tremendously interested. Of course, there would be no consequences
on earth no...
Press: No, but so....
Johnson: Because both my sister and I would like very much to read it. Of course it made
a tremendous change in our lives.
Press: Oh, sure. After he left Stanford, not by his own choice, just briefly, what did he
do? Where did he teach?
Johnson: Um, he didn't teach. He never taught again. We were going to England, he had a
commission from Gin & Company to write a text book on Ancient History. And, he said
that he could do it just as well in England and abroad as he could here. And, so we had,
um and idea, well father and mother had the idea France and England that Mr. and Mrs.
Ashby, from whom we had rented Wools Acres Hall went there to live. But, father had
had a very terrible accident when he was a young man, and was frail always. And, he had
been told by the surgeons when he had finally recovered, was released, that he never
would have good health. He would always have to be extremely careful. And he would
never have robust strength to count on. And, I don't know whether this terrible
disappointment at Stanford contributed to this or not, but he was very unwell, he was
very frail when we were in England. And then, he became a close friend with a Dr. Percy
Whithers, who was one of the men who had developed the insulin treatment, and he was
a very imminent doctor in England, and, he saw Father, they invited us to spend
Christmas with them the first year we were there, we had a lovely time with them. And
he told father he thought he should go to a doctor, and recommended a man for him to go
to, and this man told Percy Whithers afterwards, he said, "When your friend Dr. Roth
walked in, I thought I was seeing a man in the terminal stages of cancer." It turned out to
be peoria. And it was darn near terminal. But England again, developed insulin and it
developed a cure for peoria. And father was spent a long time in a nursing home there,
and father and mother found places for us in Switzerland, in Geneva, and uh, we were,
mother took us over there. And, Beatrice, my little sister, was with a family of a professor
at the University of Geneva, and a very charming wife who had two little girls, one older
and younger than Beatrice so she had a lovely lovely time. I wasn't so fortunate, I get a
family, a Swiss family that was rather indifferent. They needed the money but didn't feel
that it was a vocation in any way. So that wasn't quite so good. But, father finally got
back on his feet and was, uh, had a little strength but he never was strong and well after
that. And, I think the family helped him out after that. And we were always very very
careful. And then Harry and I were able to help later on. But, uh, it was a very appalling
tragedy for father, the Stanford thing.
32

Press: Oh yeah, well he was relatively young when that happened, right?
Johnson: Yes, yes. And he was very extraordinary and gifted teacher. It was a, it was a
strange two phases of a person. I don't, I don't doubt that Dr. Jordon had many fine
attributes, but I think that he had many appalling attributes. I think the way he, when he
came to Stanford and robbed the university he had just built-up, one of the terrible things.
Press: Yes, well as I read that one report it seemed to me that he was quite vindictive at
least in this particular *tape skip*
Johnson: Viscous.
Press: It just seemed terribly wrong. The only way it could be...it was just wrong. Totally
wrong. And, uh, your father lived out his years then where, in England or back here?
Johnson: He, uh, they had a lovely place in New Hampshire, a beautiful great pond that
had been made into a camp. And they conceived the idea of forming a girls' camp in
which they would have some athletics and summer fun. But, in which they would work
on Shakespeare, and do cultural things. And he had spent the winter visiting parents and
visiting schools, and had a really remarkable list of girls that were coming to this camp
when the first World Ward came.
Press: Oh my.
Johnson: And then people, letter after letter came saying that our sons are going to be
going to war, and we feel that we want to keep the family together. So the whole thing
just fell apart. Then they came out here to California, and lived very quietly in Carmel.
Father, writing, he had an appaling feeling of perfection. Over and over I find letters and
scraps of paper in which mother is writing to father in the nursing home and that sort of
thing, and saying, "Henry, this article, your article on so and so is so fine. It seems to me
that it should be published now, I think it's very important. I know that you feel that you
couldn't polish it anymore, but I think it should be published right away. And she was a
close friend from the Cornell days of the Atlantic Monthly, and I can't remember the
name to save my life. Um, it makes me so angry to have names.
Press: It wasn't Edward Weeks, was it?
Johnson: No. It was before that.
Press: It may have been later on.
Johnson: But anyway, *inaudible*, wasn't that the name?
Press: I don't know.

33

Johnson: Anyway, she would say, "Do let me send it." And father would say, "No, it isn't
perfect yet, Birtha." And it would never get published.
Press: Oh, how sad.
Johnson: Yes, very sad because they were very, they were very fine things.
Press: How long did he live?`
Johnson: He died just before the armistice in the second World War.
Press: The Second World War. Living in Carmel?
Johnson: No. Living, he we built a house next to our orchard for them. And, uh
Press: Where was that?
Johnson: In Brentwood, in North *inaudible*, on the edge of the canyon there, and they
lived there for ten or 15 years....and very happily, very peacefully. Father was writing
this, that and the other thing...corresponding with people, but never getting anything
published, which is very sad. But, always very frail. He uh, he couldn't sleep, if you were
going to visit father it would have to be in the morning. By the afternoon and evening he
simply didn't have any energy left. And, um, he, I went to UCLA when my children got
into school. And, I had always felt that I hadn't had enough education. And, Dean Reaber
was a dear friend of my father and mother. And he said that the function of dean in the
university is to cut *inaudible*. So he said, "You go poke around an see what you'd like
to take in the way of courses." It was not a university at that time. No graduate work at
all. So, I was the only one in my group of friends who could go.
Press: So, was this in Los Angeles or in Westford?
Johnson: It was first starting in Westwood.
Press: In Westwood? First in Westwood? Ok.
Johnson: So, Dean Reaber said, "You find what you want to take, and I'll sign your study
list." And I went down to register in the basement of one of the buildings, and I didn't
know anything about the professors, so I asked in line a student, "who was a good teacher
of English?" And there was a vast discussion, and it very soon became clear that there
was one outstanding teacher, and that was Franklin Roth. And, uh, so I went in and
signed-up for Franklin Roth's course. And, uh, the first time we met he said, "I
*inaudible* about this. You all know that I can't read and do the *inaudible* work for 35
students in an English writing course. I should turn half of them over to Ritas. The other
half I shall work with and try to really help. And, half of you are probably taking this
because it's an easy three units. The other half are taking it because they want to learn to
write, and I shall know the different." And, we all kind of waited, and I was so pleased
34

when I had gotten back my first paper, written over the outside, "this is very interesting
material, but I think it can be handled better. Please come talk to me in my office." So, I
was tickled. And, uh, Franklin Roth came in time, he and his wife came to dinner, father
and mother were there. And father and Franklin decided that they were related because
they both came from Concord, New Hampshire originally. And they weren't going to go
into it because they weren't going to find out they weren't related, they knew they were.
And they had the most enchanting friendship, but Franklin would take his time when he
had some early in the morning times Saturday or Sunday, something like that, they'd go
over to daddy's big study with the nice fire and talk and talk and talk. So, he was always
an intensely interesting human being, and people interested in the education of youth and
what was going on in the world, and what could be developed, made a great effort to
come and talk to him at the time when he had a great strength to talk.
Press: How wonderful because of your desire to do more with your education, you got the
two of them together. Isn't that great?
Johnson: Yes! Isn't that fun?
Press: Let me ask you this, you said that when your children were in school you decided
to go back to UCLA. How old were you at that time? Were your kids little?
Johnson: Approximately 30, I think. The oldest son was born when I was just 21. And,
uh, he would have been, when he went to afternoon school I suppose that would have
been third grade, wouldn't it? About 8. 28, 29, 30.
Press: Well, the reason I asked, I grew-up in Santa Monica, I may have mentioned to you.
Johnson: No, I didn't know that. I had forgotten if you had mentioned it.
Press: And, my sister was five years older than I, and went to UCLA. And, she graduated
in about 34, let's say, or something like that. Same time she was there my mother, who
was about 45 or 50, had gone to Santa Monica City College, she had never gone to
college. She had gone to work as a little girl and became an executive secretary, went to
Santa Monica City College, graduated, and junior college it was then called...and then
went to UCLY. Must've been about the same time. And, she swears that she was the
oldest student at UCLA at the time, and she was about 50. And, she graduated. She got
her ED in History.
Johnson: Good for her!
Press: And, she's 95 now...
Johnson: I've never knitted it up, and when I was moving up here somebody said to me,
looked at me kind of cock-eyed and said, "Well, now's the time for your to go back and
get your Stanford degree."

35

Press: How long did you go to UCLA?
Johnson: Oh, of and on for 5 years.
Press: Did you graduate?
Johnson: No, I didn't. I didn't even get things lined-up, I just took what I wanted, you
know.
Press: Well, how great that you did it.
Johnson: It was wonderful. I had Dr. Boudine, he was the teacher of History and
Philosophy. Dr. Locky's American History and South American History, both of them
eminent men in their fields, you know? And then I took a lot of geology because my
husband was a very social person, and he had a great many geologists when they were
passing through town and that sort of thing, they'd come and stay with us. And around the
fire after dinner the talk would be of this and this and this and this. And, you know it
turned out to be a such and such, and I wouldn't know...it turned out to be a hogback. So,
what's a hogback in geological terms? So I decided this was nonsense, I didn't like sitting
in front of my own fire saying, "what a hogback?" So, I went back to UCLA and I got
course with the man who was the head of the department at that time, and I sat through
one lecture. And, he told us in great details about his picnic lunch, and when he had taken
it in the hills and someone had sat on it, and what he had...so I decided that something
had to be done about that, I wasn't interested in Professor's picnic lunches, and so I
rearranged my schedule, keeping only Franklin Roth's English, and changed courses
around and went with tears running down my cheeks to tell the geology professor that I
had had a conflict, and I had had to take Ed ulfur's Geology 1.
Press: That was very well done.
Johnson: Well, everybody knew that Harry Johnson's wife was taking geology, so I had
to find some way of getting out of this *inaudible*, Ed Sulfur was a very brisk, very
charming , very competent teacher.
Press: Good. Well, you married a working geologist and uh, where did you travel *tape
skip* to do some work at Stanford or near Stanford?
Johnson: No, he didn't, he had never came back to Stanford after he graduated. But, he
did geology.
Press: Where did you go?
Johnson: Well, when we were first married, we went to Oklahoma, Louisiana. He, uh, my
father had said, "I will allow my daughter to get married at 18 provided that you have a
steady job. I don't like this consulting business." And, uh, cross-consulting, which Harry,
36

was all his life except a year or two there, is off again on again. One day it's milk and
honey, and the next day ain't got no money. And, that was exactly what father didn't
want. So, Harry scratched around and got a job as a geologist for the Atlas Oil Company,
which was in Oklahoma, Louisiana. And, we went and lived in Tree Port for a little
while, and then went and lived in Tulsa. We lived in Tulsa when the wonderful time
came and oil went to a dollar a barrel. It was pretty exciting, I'll tell you.
Press: I bet it was.
Johnson: Yeah. And, uh, I didn't have anything to keep me at home, and I was thoroughly
drilled in climbing *inaudible*, trees and everything that boys and active girls did. So,
we spent most of the time in the fields. We would get a box of oranges and tickets and
take the railway with our suitcases to wherever the area that Harry wanted to exam, and
then we'd hire a horse and buggy, and we would drive out into the area that he wanted to
see, and he would spend the day tramping over the heels and I would spend the day
tramping a little and then sitting down under the tree with my binoculars and bird book
and sewing and letter writing, and that sort of thing. In then as night would come, we
would stop and knock on little farm doors and ask them if they could take us in at night.
And we always found a place. One night we stopped in a house with a very charming
couple, poor as church mice, and uh, a grown son. And, the woman said, "I can't make
you comfortable, I don't have anything to make you comfortable with, but sure I'll take
you in. Nobody else around here will." And, we had the traditional super, which was salt
pork chunks boiled, and then a little flour thickening in boiled water for gravy. And then
great big biscuits, 3-3.5 inches across and baked until they were kind of creamy white not
crispy brown. Split the gravy from the salt pork, pour it over the biscuits and a chunk of
salt pork in your plate, and that was the meal. That was all. You talk about Okies, now I
know why they were Okies. But, this particular night, everybody was ready to go to bed
early, and the farmer’s wife and I brushed our teeth at the kitchen sink, and the men went
out the barn. And, uh, then we went in to this little tiny living room, she said, "Now you
and your husband take that bed and we'll take this bed." And they had two double beds in
the corner, in the corners of this little living room. And the son and the wife and the
father climbed into one bed, and Harry and I climbed into the other, and all was silent.
And then Harry muttered into my ear," You know there's no window open in here?" "I
know there isn't, but you wait until they're asleep." So, pretty soon we heard three
separate deep breathings, and I got up, undid the latch and opened the window. And the
next day, the whole breakfast was of conversation, rapid conversation of "how did that
window get open?"
Press: Never occurred to them.
Johnson: Never occurred to them, no. So we did that for a year and a half, then we were
going to have a little baby coming, and we decided that life in Oklahoma, North Eastern
Texas and Southern Kansas and Northwestern Louisiana was not what we wanted. And a
steady job was all very well, but you didn't have to have a steady job. So, we gave up the
steady job and came back to Santa Monica and went back to consulting.

37

Press: And you did find the ever there after. Terrific.
Johnson: Yep.
Press: How wonderful that you had the bringing up of being on your own as a little girl
from riding the horse from Portolla Valley to Ms. Harker's so that you were independent.
And then that year and a half meant a lot to you, and you could cope with it, it was great
for you, for Harry...
Johnson: It was the most amazing experience...recently I've heard um, I've seen a picture
about early days in the oil fields in that area. And, they showed the wooden barracks and
the sumps with the liquid mud running off, you know, and they, the twelve hour work
shift and the men living in bunkhouses not able to get away at all. And, everywhere
meanness, and I was so angry that the only time I wanted to go to a director and skin him
alive. Because that's not the way it was. They were hard living, they were rough
uneducated, the *inaudible* were uneducated lot in other ways than in handling oil
equipment, but they were descent kindly human beings. And, uh, I had all sorts of
extraordinary experiences. I learned very quickly that you asked a driller, the top dog in
the derrick, whether you could do this that and the other thing. And, I quite early asked
one driller whether I might climb his derrick. And he looked at men and he said, "Sure,
climb it if you want to." He didn't tell me, and I wasn't wise enough at that stage, this was
early on, to know that they had just finished bailing, and were ready to drop the tools, and
that the well was fairly deep. And when they dropped tools, uh, in a deeper well, they
simply let them drop as fast as they will, and the great drum that the cable is wound on
rotates it as fast as it wants to. It just spins lickity-split. And everything waves around
with the motion. This I didn't know. But I climbed to the top of the deck, and I reckon I
just got up to this little six or eight foot platform. It couldn't have been more than six
because my feet and hand just reached the kitty corner across it, when the derrick began
to jump, this terrific motion, and I'd realized that I'd been had...And uh, so I laid down,
there was nothing but 2x4 at the corners and two where you climbed up the latter and a
stringer up at the top. That was the only protection. So I laid down *inaudible* with my
hands on one thing and my feet braced against the other one, and simply rode it out. And,
uh, I was frightened, but I wasn't about to shriek. And, when it was all over and the well
was back chunkity, I climbed down again, and everybody had kind of a queer expression,
I straightened myself up and began talking to my husband, nothing was said by them or
by me.
Press: Good for you. That's remarkable. Did your husband know you were up there?
Johnson: Oh, sure.
Press: So he was probably a part of the joke.
Johnson: Well, he, I wouldn't put it beyond him.
Press: How were you treated as a young woman by these rough, rough group.
38

Johnson: With complete courtesy, and I must've been awfully trying. Harry liked to
smoke every once in a while a cigar. And, I think that smoking cigars is just about the
lowest form of human activity, and I wasn't going to have a husband that smoked a cigar.
And, when I had been in England, he wouldn't have been smoking a cigarette. And I had
tried smoking cigarettes, and I had decided that it was a perfectly nasty habit. It made my
mouth taste like a bird cage, and I was going to have none of it. But, I knew how to
smoke a cigarette. And, I told Harry that if he smoked a cigar, I was going to smoke a
cigarette. And, of course in America it wasn't *inaudible*. And, uh, so on one of these
derricks, they hadn't reached gas or oil or of course they wouldn't have been smoking.
But, Harry pulled out a cigar and lit it, and looked at me. And, I turned to one of the
*inaudible* and said, "Do you have a cigarette?" And he said, "Yeah..." And I said, "May
I have one?"
"Yeah..." And he held a match for me, and I smoked my cigarette, and there was nothing
further said about it.
Press: Well, I bet they all looked at you.
Johnson: They all looked. Then they were bailing, and as you probably know when a
bailer comes up it has an anchor at the bottom that lifts the thing that stops the mud from
falling out. And they put it in a hole in the floor on the cross-spot. And that anchor is
lifted and the mud flows out onto the derrick. Well, up came this bailer of liquid hot mud,
and it flashed through my mind well at the angle of that bailer, where is the mud going?
And, when the bailer hit the ground and the mud went, and it simply went all over me.
An absolute cascade of hot liquid mud. Not dangerously hot, but hot gooey. And then
everyone lept to attention. The drillers and the *inaudible* and my husband. They all
grabbed fire buckets and rushed to the tubs where the water was for protection of the
derrick and through water over me with the greatest joy to wash me off. When that was
all over I said, "Well, I think I'll go back to the farm and change my clothes." So I took
the horse and buggy and went back to the farm and changed my clothes, but Harry stayed
for super because he needed to watch the next, what was happening in the well. And the
driller was very quiet, and then all of a sudden he balled his fist up and banged it down on
the table, bang, and said (you can delete this if you want to), "I'll be God-damned if I like
to see a woman smoke."
Press: No, I won't delete that. I'm just going to turn the tape over right here.

Press: And I suspect, maybe, did you come back to Stanford or have we pretty much
covered all the Stanford connection? I can't....
Johnson: I think we pretty much covered it because it was very *inaudible*
Press: Yeah, it was early on when you were a little girl...
Johnson: Yes, it was early on...um, we spoke I think of father's, uh, connection with Mr.
*inaudible*....
Press: Yes.
Johnson: *inaudible* And *inaudible*....and Mr....
Press: No, I think we just barely mentioned it. Was, were they, was Mr. *inaudible*
teaching here at the same time?
Johnson: Yes. Yes. Yes.
Press: I see.
Johnson: And he was writing, and mother became a very close friend of Mrs.
*inaudible*, who was a very precious dear person. And, uh, father, Douglan used to
come tramping up to our house and father and he would disappear and talk for hours, and
then father would go down to *inaudible* on some, for some purpose, and go in and talk
to Mr. Douglan, and we would go down and play in the creek. That was the only time
that I've ever really had an intimate relationship with *inaudible*
Press: Oh, really? Oh my goodness...
Johnson: They were wonderful. Are they still there at the creek?
Press: I have not looked. That's a big slug.
Johnson: Oh, they were perfectly gorgeous. Great golden creatures...
Press: Well, you were an outdoor girl, weren't you? Nothing bothered you.
Johnson: Not at all.
Press: I don't see how it could. What a great, great life it must have been.

40

Johnson: It was a lovely life, and a very beautiful place that, uh, we were there for about
five years. And, um, it made a tremendous impression. I don't think I shall ever get over
my love of the golden grass, those golden hills there.
Press: It is so beautiful...
Johnson: Do you know what the piece of land, out in back somewhere, and I can't I can't,
I see it every once in a while but I can't put my finger on it...where the smooth hills have
been planted...
Press: Oh wait a minute--ok, I, let's see if I know where it is. It's out, Sand Hill Road, by
the linear accelerator center, that is land that Stanford University has leased to somebody
for a Christmas tree farm. That's what it is. I'm pretty sure.
Johnson: Well, it's a desecration.
Press: Really?
Johnson: Well, I think to take the smooth golden hills and put Christmas trees, and it's
terrible...
Press: Well, what, you're probably right. I could see that because I love the hills, too. I
love the smooth grass. Right now as you drive along...*tape skips* a switch in time will
turn to your golden ground.
Johnson: I would always go out on Foot Hill to, um, Page Mill, and over to California to
do my errands, instead of going the shorter, the quicker root down Arastadero to El
Camino...
Press: Oh yeah, it's much quicker...
Johnson: That, oh that lovely country...
Press: It is so pretty...Well, how long have you been back up here now?
Johnson: Since June...
Press: Just since June. You haven't been down to Santa Monica all that time?
Johnson: Well, the same old, big old *inaudible*, which Harry and I built in 1919. He,
uh, his father had been a Civil War Union Officer, and he, the minute the war started he
tried to enlist, and they wouldn't take him. They said they needed oil more than they
needed men. And, he felt, he really felt very much crushed by it. But, he didn't, he was a
*inaudible* or whatever they called it. He did all sorts of jobs while he did he oil job.
But, in that result was, when the war was over in 1919, he had a bank account and most
people didn't. And prices were very very low. And we were able, without a tremendous
41

amount of money, to build our big old Adobe house. He'd always said he had wanted an
Adobe house. And, uh, he found land of the edge of the canyon there in Frankwood.
Press: It's so beautiful there...
Johnson: Oh, yes, a lovely area. And, he thought the dirt was suitable for Adobe bricks
because you can't make bricks out of Adobe soil. They crack. You have to have sand and
*inaudible* in it. And, uh, we'd had a very dramatic time building the house. And, there
was a big sprawling old Spanish hacienda with a great big high living room and a breeze
way between the living room and the bedrooms, which is all very well when the children
were young and the family was going there, but after the children were all gone, and
harry was gone and I was living there alone, a breeze way between the kitchen, the living
rooms and the bedrooms in an area that was having a great deal of trouble with burglary
and assault and that sort of thing, wasn't so good. So, I finally decided to change, I think I
changed mainly because my son, David, came down once on a business trip and was
spending one night with me, and, uh, it was late afternoon and the great *inaudible* and
it's tapestries and statues and things were flooded with *inaudible* the sunlight, and I had
arranged very carefully the flowers for David, and we were sitting there having a drink,
and I said, "David, isn't it beautiful?" And he said, "Yes mother, it's very beautiful. But
you do realize, don't you, that's it's a mausoleum?" And I think that's when I decided to
come live at Stanford where my family was.
Press: How many children did you and Harry have?
Johnson: Five. We had, we lost one boy, I had two boys.
Press: Two boys.
Johnson: One lives up in Washington State, and one lives here with Stanford Research.
Press: And, how many grandchildren do you have?
Johnson: I have 6 grandchildren, and I have 2 great-grandchildren. So, I'm coming on...
Press: Isn't that wonderful? Well, I think we have pretty well covered the territory that I
had in mind. If I think of any others, I'll be back, but uh, this is probably a good place to
conclude it. And, also, from a time point of view with you going up to British Columbia,
is it?
Johnson: Yes.
Press: It works out fine.
This concludes the interview of the third session with Mrs. Johnson on April 2nd, 1982,
and it's the end *inaudible*

42

Johnson: My friend lives out in *inaudible* and she would have to come in to the air port
to get me. I'd phone her.
Press: That's a great fit. Well, I want to thank you so much for all your help. This has
been just very enjoyable for me to listen and to learn...
Johnson: Great fun!
Press: Because I love history, and I do thank you.

This is Judy Adams interviewing Olivia Johnson for the Stanford Oral History Project,
July 9th 1987 at her home.
*tape skips, very inaudible, microphone adjustment*
Johnson: And his mother became the, um, housemother for the Delta U fraternity at
Stanford so that the uh....Greek...
Adams: He was a Greek? So your connection goes back to your father's teaching here
when you were a girl.
Johnson: 1902, I was six years old.
Adams: What do you remember on campus at that time?
Johnson: Oh, yes I do. I was a frail little girl, and I lived in Chicago, and I got mumps.
And the, one of the professor's wives where father was teaching, I don't know where it
was, said, "Oh, don't worry about mumps, mumps is nothing." She had had a lot of
children, mother hadn't, and, uh so mother didn't worry about mumps and the results is
they abscessed and they very nearly lost their little girl. And, uh, the doctor said, "If you
want to keep your little girl, you'll leave Chicago immediately." And it was right then that
the call came from Stanford to come out and teach here. So, they just packed-up and
came out. And, uh, I had always felt very guilty that they had such a dear rich life in New
England and with their old Cornell friends and all. And then they came out to this
completely new area, except for Dr. Jordon, with the help of the President of Cornell, had
gathered a lot of his faculty from Cornell graduates.
Adams: So your father had colleagues...
Johnson: So when, um, they came out here, one of their very dear friends was
*inaudible* Marx, another was David Marx another was Charles Wing, and uh, so it went
back to Fish and, oh, quite a number of men they knew well. And, it wasn't until, I'd
always felt pretty guilty about it.
Adams: I take it you'd recovered from the effects of the mumps. Regained your health...
Johnson: Oh yes! It wasn't until perhaps 25 years ago, long after everyone had settled
here and was happy, that I found (heard) that they had gone to a picture exhibit at the Art
Institute in Chicago. And it had been an exhibit of a man, a painter, and I don't remember
his name, who had painted in all sorts of places, but among other places he painted in
California in the summer. And, they had thought that the golden grass hills was one of the
most beautiful things they had ever seen. So they settled on the corner of Lincoln and
Ramona, which was Professorville in those days. And, um, then after the earthquake,
father and Mr. Dodge bought forty acres of land where *inaudible* runs across the
44

*inaudible* and into the hills. They bought 40 acres of land there, and each of them built
a house.
Adams: Closer to the golden grass...
Johnson: Yeah, and, uh, it was a lovely place to grow up and to live.
Adams: What do you remember in your childhood being unique about being in a
University town? Did you have friends who weren't faculty children?
Johnson: Not that I was conscious of. I can look back and see friends that lived on the
block that weren't faculty children, but the ones that I knew well, really well were mostly
the faculty children. And, uh, I remember the...what was it? The family that had four,
four boys. And I'll get their names pretty soon, my memory for names is pretty bad. And,
uh, they all came down with the typhoid fever. You remember the time that there was
such a terrible epidemic of typhoid here? They found that the milk, the cows had all been
examined and they, the processing of the milk had all been examined, all very fine, and
they after...finally it was found that the cans or the buckets, the basic material was being
washed in water from a well up the hill. And, that uh, it was infected. And it was terrible
uh, infection, went all through Stanford. I think it was professor Wing who had four boys,
all came down with typhoid. And Dr. Wilbur, *inaudible* was a doctor at that time. And,
here was a college professor, with a college professor's salary, and four children to raise
and Dr. Wilbur came to that house, practically every day for several days, and made four
charges for each visit. And, that, practically finished Wilbur's as far as we were
concerned. Mrs. Wilbur has one time, had a baby boy, and she knew that mother had had
a little girl who was very frail. I remember as a child of six standing by my little baby
sister's crib, and two ladies came in to see the little baby. And mother had to run up the
stair for something. And, I never know why those two women spoke in front of me. I
can't imagine it. But they did. And, one of them shook her head and said, "Birtha will
never be able to raise that baby."
Adams: Meaning that she was frail and...

Johnson: Meaning that she was so frail that she couldn't possibly live. But, mother had
this very elaborate baby scale because she had to know exactly what was happening to
the baby. But then, Mrs. Jordon had a baby, and her mother had a scale and sent that one
out so that she might borrow out. So, she borrowed it, but she never returned it. Don't you
see? I have a mixed memory.
Adams: How many brothers and sisters other than the younger sister...
Johnson: I have just one sister, six years younger.
Adams: Did she survive?

45

Johnson: Yes, she survived. She died of Alzheimer’s at 80.
Adams: A good long life...
Johnson: Yes, it was a good long life.
Adams: What do you remember about, uh, your growing up years? Going to school
here...your playmates.
Johnson: I don't remember anything of very great importance in the very early years.
Father used to walk, he loved to walk, you know that habit of New Englanders, and uh,
he used to walk to the university almost every day. And, uh, when you cross the railway,
when Embarcadero crossed the railway, and this was a level crossing under the
*inaudible*, and just the other side of the right hand side, there was a great big old farm
house with marvelous Ashtrees in front of it. And, between the road and the Ashtrees, a
very deep ditch. Why? I don't know. And it was always, always had water in it. I suppose
water in the orchids, there was some leakage. There was always some water there. And it
had the most marvelous pollywogs. Great, big luscious pollywogs. And, when father had
a little extra time, he was very kind to his daughter. He would start a little early, and we
would walk to that crossing and we would cross the railway, being very careful to look
both directions, and then he would stop while I filled a mason jar with pollywogs. And
then he would take me and see me across the railway and wave goodbye. And, he'd walk
to the university.
Adams: Did it grow any frogs?
Johnson: Oh, yes, beautiful frogs.
Adams: Where did you go to school? In a...in a...
Johnson: No, I went to Ms. Harker's School. It was before Ms. Harker's School was built,
the big one. And, uh, they had a building on Bryant between...no no I guess it was
Lincoln, just off of Lincoln, and uh, then they had an annex, and the annex was right next
to our house. And old Mrs. Harker was in charge of the annex, and lived there with 6 or 8
girls. And, uh, she was quite literally the only adult who i was afraid of. Mother and
father were not the kind of parents that made their children afraid.
Adams: What was is about her that scared you?
Johnson: Well, she was a very fierce little girl, and she intended to maintain discipline,
and she, I guess she knew she had a bundle to handle. Anyway, the morning of the
earthquake, I remember, we had the small earthquake, but then father said, "Now this is
an earthquake." *inaudible* And then I woke-up that morning, and the house was
shaking, everything was shaking I knew it was an earthquake. And I saw a great big
picture come crashing off the wall and fall onto my sister's crib. Just missed her head.
And, then I saw daddy come in, he was very frail, and he slept in a separate room, mother
46

slept with the two children in the center. And, I saw him come in, and lurching and
struggling to walk because of the shaking of the earth. They'd been given a high-back
rocking chair as a wedding present, and it was in that chair that we would always rock
when our knees were hurting, you know. `Anyway, father grabbed that, trying to stay on
his feet, and my main memory of the earthquake was watching father and the chair Waltz
in the middle of the room. When the ground eased enough so that you could walk, we all
rushed out onto the lawn. And, Mrs. Harker came rushing out onto the lawn with her
children, with her little girls with her. And, she was a short little woman, chunky little
woman. And she had her dark hair all done up in curl papers. She had a long flannel night
gown on with a high collar and a ruffle at the top of the collar. And cuffs and a little
ruffle by the cuffs. And bare feet, nubbly old feet, and she rushed over and she flung
herself at my father--put her arms up around his neck and began crying on his bossom.
"Oh Dr. Roth, Dr. Roth, what are we to do?" And I stood there and thought, "Hmph, well
I should be afraid of you."
Adams: She had *inaudible* What was the curriculum like at Harker for a young woman.
What courses did you take?
Johnson: It was, um, oh just an ordinary school.
Adams: Classics, education in the classics?
Johnson: Yes. Yes. And, um, then we went to Europe in 1911. I used to drive down from
the, from up near the Sharon Estate. I'd hitch up the horse and buggy and ride down to the
Harker school. I'd actually get way out to Embarcadero. And, uh, unharness the horse, put
him in the shed and go into school. And, uh, that was in the latter years, getting towards
high school. And, uh, work hard, and at the end of the afternoon have lunch there. Go and
hitch the horse up and drive home again. And, uh, I remember once I lost a hat, a hat that
I was very fond of, and I got home and I realized that it had been on the carriage seat and
it wasn't there any longer. And, then one day as I was driving home I saw it on a girl, and
I stopped the car and I said, "That's my hat, and I want it back again." And, so, she gave it
back to me so I had my hat. I still have it.
Adams: At least the horse wasn't wearing it.
Johnson: No. The horse wasn't wearing it. But, the Harker School then became a very
nice girl's school. And uh, I went to it for two or three years, a couple--a year I guess--of
high school. And, then, father decided was going to write a, he was leaving Stanford and
was going to write a text book on teaching Greek. They said he could do it as well in
England as California. So, uh, we went to Chipping Camden and lived there, and spent a
winter in Munich and then Chipping Camden, and spent long summers in Switzerland
*inaudible*. Came back when the war began, and then by that time my future husband
had come, had managed to get the Texaco company to send him my on some special
mission in London. Very important mission. But he spent a great deal of his weekends
with us in Chipping Camden. And...

47

Adams: A different kind of prospect...
Johnson: Yes, and father, I wanted, he proposed to me when I was 13. And father would
hear none of it. And, uh, but he finally said when I got to be 18 that he would let me get
married at 19
