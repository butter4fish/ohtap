This is Helene Leichter. I am interviewing Rosemary McAndrews at her
residence in Mountain View. It is August 21st, 2012. This interview is being
performed in connection with the Stanford Historical Society Staff Oral
History Project. Let's start at the beginning. Could you tell us where you
were born, Rosemary?

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

[00:00:35] Butte, Montana.
When was that?
[00:00:40] February 22, 1921.
Could you describe a little bit about your childhood in Butte? I know you
were there for about 7 years.

McAndrews:

[00:00:53] I was initially there until I was two and a half. Then my parents
had the good sense to leave for California, and they had the poor judgment
to go back about three years later, when I was five or six. We only stayed
for a year, and then we returned to San Francisco and stayed there.

Leichter:

Was your family from Butte originally?

11

McAndrews:

[00:01:18] No. Both of my parents were immigrants, my father from Nova
Scotia, Canada and my mother from Ireland.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

What brought them to Butte, Montana? Was it mining or ranching?
[00:01:53] The mining, I suppose, for my father, and my mother had
relatives there. At that time, of course, you had to have relatives in America
who would pledge to support you. But they never supported my mother.
She found a job right away and went to secretarial school at night. My father
became a salesman and eventually they opened a general store.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

They met and married in Butte?
[00:02:13] Yes. They met and married in Butte.
You moved to San Francisco in 1928?
[00:02:19] Yes.
Could you describe a little bit about San Francisco that you remember from
your childhood pre-World War II?

McAndrews:

[00:02:26] I remember it vividly because it was so different from Butte. For
one thing, the weather was beautiful. We could play outside all year. In
Butte we had winter for nine months, and sometimes it was the coldest
place in the nation. The games were clever and different in Butte and we
mostly played outside in what seemed like eternal snow and ice. I missed the
winter games but that is about all I missed. Anyway, San Francisco was like
a small town when we arrived. It was composed of rather distinct
neighborhoods and we stayed in our own neighborhood. The divisions were
mostly along ethnic lines.

Leichter:

What neighborhood was yours?

12

McAndrews:

[00:03:14] First, I was in the Mission Dolores District, then in Sunset and
Parkmerced.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Did you go to public or private school?
Private. I went to Catholic schools.
I am interested in your impressions of growing up in San Francisco.
[00:03:46] It was a wonderful place to grow up. We rarely locked our doors.
Everybody was very friendly. It was an exhilarating place to be after Butte.
I saw my first black person. At that time, nobody of any color other than
white was allowed in Butte. They were marched to the state line and told to
leave. Even as a child I thought that was strange. Anyway, that's the way it
was. There were exciting things to do in San Francisco and they didn't cost
any money. I discovered the public libraries. We didn’t have anything like
that in Butte. I used to spend just about every Saturday sitting on the library
floor reading books. I read all of the Oz books, and all of the fairy tale
books, and all of the girls' books. There were museums there in San
Francisco that, well, let's put it this way, there was very little to offer in
Butte of an intellectual nature. There were no museums, no libraries, and
no aura of a big city. It was a very small town. It was a rough and tumble
town. Miners were not known for their gentility. San Francisco was a
revelation to me, the ocean, the beauty of the forested hills and valleys and
the vibrancy of downtown. I had access to the arts when I grew older. I met
lots of wonderful people in San Francisco. I met my husband there. It was
just a great place to grow up.

Leichter:

You graduated from high school in 1938, '39?

13

McAndrews:

[00:05:47] Yes, '38. I was graduated a year early because I had skipped third
grade.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

What did you do after high school?
I went to Business College for a year. I had been offered a scholarship to
the San Francisco College for Women, but it was still the depth of the
Depression and I had neither the carfare nor the wardrobe to go to "Lone
Mountain." I had saved enough money to attend Business College.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Was there a particular course of study that you had there?
The customary for a young girl of that era: secretarial. The usual choices
were either a secretary or a nurse.

Leichter:

Did you meet your husband before or after you went to New York?

McAndrews:

I met my husband in San Francisco. We both worked for the same
company.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

Which company was that?
Arabian American Oil Company. An exciting place to be.
It sounds like it at that time. What did your husband do for Arabian
American?

McAndrews:

He worked in the purchasing department. I was a secretary in another office
for about six months, maybe a year. Arabian American Oil Company was
relatively new. I had worked at Standard Oil prior to working at the
Arabian American Oil Company, and all the procedures there had been in
place for years. Everything was cut and dried. There were few opportunities
for promotion. At Arabian American Oil Company, recently set up by
Standard Oil as a separate company, they were hiring people to staff both

14

the head office in the US and Arabia, and there were lots of opportunities. I
became the supervisor of the Corporate Records, Delivery and Safekeeping
Division.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Was it a large company?
No, there were 27 people in the United States when I went there and the
field office in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia had between 200-300 employees. The
wartime demand for oil made it imperative to increase production with a
corresponding increase in staff. It was necessary to build a new refinery and
have the crude refined on site before shipment to wherever the demand was
the greatest. The name of the company when I first went there was
California-Arabian Standard Oil Company. Within a couple of years when
they realized how much oil there was in Saudi Arabia – it took quite a while
to produce in commercial quantities – they hired people right and left. It
was just phenomenal. The hallways were filled with people in line waiting to
apply for a job and the growth simply mushroomed.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

What made you move to New York then with your husband?
I was transferred to New York a few months before my future husband
arrived there. The head office was moved to New York and some of us
were sent to open up or join our separate divisions there.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

This would have been after the war?
[00:10:44] Yes, this was in 1949.
I'd like to go back for a minute. Can you tell me about San Francisco during
World War II?

15

McAndrews:

San Francisco was both a debarkation and embarkation point, and it was
exciting and scary. I learned very quickly that I had to be very careful in San
Francisco, which was a new experience, but the service men about to go
overseas had a heightened awareness of how short life could be and they
lived in the moment.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

What would you do out at night in San Francisco during the war?
The streets were jammed, mostly with sailors leaving to fight the island wars
in the Pacific, but the army was there in great numbers also. It was a 24hour a day town. As I said, I avoided trouble, so it probably wasn't as
exciting for me as it might have been.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

I'm sure there was lots of opportunity. You moved to New York in 1949?
Yes.
Was that a welcome change? Was it a shock?
No, it was exciting. I had never been anywhere but Butte and San Francisco
and when I was offered a transfer to New York, I took it. I didn't want to
be left behind in what was to become a branch office. I never gave it a
second thought. When they asked me to go, I said yes. I looked forward to
it. I was young and New York had all kind of connotations of excitement.
Everything seemed to be going on at once: Broadway, access to many of the
arts, Wall Street, the United Nations, the best and most of life. I had never
been away from home before. Now I would be on my own. In those days
you stayed home until you got married. You didn't go out and get an
apartment as soon as you got a diploma.

Leichter:

How did you travel to New York?

16

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

[00:13:13] I took my first airplane trip.
That was exciting.
That was exciting, particularly since the woman next to me grabbed my arm
as the pilot went down the aisle and said, "Do you think he's been
drinking?" That had never occurred to me.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Before you took off or after?
Before we took off.
Were you living in the city or in one of the boroughs?
I lived in Manhattan on East 17th Street, near what was called the Gramercy
Park District. Gramercy Park was on East 23rd Street. Manhattan was
divided into districts. The converted brownstone where I had an apartment
was between the Lower East Side and Gramercy Park, which was an upscale
area, an island of calm because the park was fenced and only certain
addresses fronting on the park had keys.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Were your offices on Wall Street or downtown?
[00:14:10] The offices were in midtown at 505 Park Avenue, in a brand new
building on the corner of 59th.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Very close to Grand Central.
They had just started building in New York after the war. We had a new
building that nobody had ever occupied before and the company leased the
whole building. I could look down at Park Avenue from my office and it
was like fairyland at Christmas.

Leichter:

You had a lot more employees by then I imagine.

17

McAndrews:

Yes, the increase in employees was remarkable. They only took division
heads and specialists to New York, so we did a lot of hiring in New York.
The expansion in the field was almost exponential and, once again, the halls
were full of people looking for employment in Arabia.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Was it unusual being a woman administrator for that company?
[00:15:17] Yes, or for any company in those days.
Were you the only one?
I don't know. I never thought of that before, but I may have been.
How were you treated as a woman?
I was treated very well, partly, I suppose, because I was a hard worker. In
addition, the departure of so many young men to serve in World War II had
opened up opportunities for promotion of women that might not otherwise
have occurred. The executives at Aramco were gentlemen but also were part
of the zeitgeist of the time, that is, women were not management material.
Somehow I had slipped through the net. That is, until I had my first review
as an assistant manager. My immediate supervisor prepared the review for
the department head to discuss with me. There were thirty categories with
about six ratings, the first two of which were "excellent" and "very good." I
received twenty-nine checks in the "excellent" column and one in the "very
good." At the bottom under "Recommendation for promotion", the
department head had written: "not recommended until the above has been
corrected." My score was one point away from "Perfect!" After a stunned
silence, I said that I thought the real reason was that I was a woman, and if
he substituted that for the reason given I would initial as required and he did

18

and I did. The perfect riposte came to me a day or two later: "And how are
your daughters?"
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

He put down "because you were a woman"?
Yes, which was perfectly acceptable in those days.
Did you enjoy living in the city?
Oh yes. If I thought San Francisco was exciting, New York was
unbelievable. Nobody ever seemed to go to bed. The first night I stayed
there I was in a hotel. It was August and miserably hot. I got up at 3 o'clock
in the morning because I couldn't sleep, and I thought I'd go down and get
a newspaper. I went down and the street was teeming with people at that
hour. It was just amazing. Then, there was all this life pulsing there, like
high noon. The office on Park Avenue had a beautiful street to look down
on from far above. There was the theater. I mean all those wonderful
plays, like South Pacific. I saw South Pacific with Mary Martin the first month I
was there, which was pretty heady, and lots of other plays too with actors
whom I recognized: Hepburn, Henry Fonda, Carol Channing. Then there
were all the museums. There was something going on at every moment,
everywhere.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Lots of parades and festivals.
How can I describe it? The sidewalks were crowded with people moving
quickly. If you walked along the street you couldn't go slow or you'd get
knocked down. Getting acquainted with the subway and living in my own
apartment. I had a roommate because, among other reasons, the rent was
unaffordable alone.

19

Leichter:
McAndrews:

What was the ethnic mix like then on the Lower East Side?
Then it was predominantly white, lots of Jewish people, some Puerto
Ricans. There weren't very many people of color there of which I was
aware. It was a mixture. It was America. It was also not far in from Ellis
Island, the landing place from Europe, so it was full of immigrants. I lived
not too far from that enclave. There was an Orthodox Jewish area where
they wore ringlets, and yarmulkes, black fedoras and the long overcoats. I
used to get up early on Saturday morning and go down there to look at
people because it was so unusual to see people dressed like that, and in
addition, conducting business on the sidewalk. Then there were the other
ethnic neighborhoods: Irish, German, Italian.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

You were pretty close to Little Italy.
Yes. The Irish and other nationalities were mostly in the other boroughs -Staten Island, Long Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

You went there in 1949. How long did you stay?
I didn’t stay very long. My husband and I got married in 1950 and I was
expecting a child in mid-1951. At that time, it seem like everybody was
transferring to Arabia. I had read and heard a lot about life in Arabia. The
children, I think by the time they were 10 years old, had to be sent to Egypt
or somewhere else abroad to go to school. The company hadn’t yet built
enough schools to meet the demand. The thought of putting a child on an
airplane to go to school was too much to ask. We knew we were going to
be transferred to Arabia eventually, so we decided to come home.

Leichter:

Could you have even worked in the office in Arabia given the division?

20

McAndrews:

Oh yes. Aramco was very circumspect about observing the customs of the
country – "when in Rome" and each culture respected the other.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

You came back to San Francisco?
[00:22:42] Yes.
Your husband was working for the same company at that time?
He transferred to a California affiliate of Standard Oil Company.
Your daughter was born in 1950?
In 1951.
Were you living in San Francisco or down here at Stanford?
We actually got into Parkmerced in San Francisco, which was a real coup
then. There was a long waiting list, but we did manage to get in. We lived
there until my husband was transferred to Livermore. He was with the
Standard Oil Company that started the radiation lab in Livermore, later
taken over by UC Berkeley. We wanted to find a halfway point between
Livermore and San Francisco and moved to the Mid-Peninsula. He worked
at Livermore about 3 years, then UC Berkeley took it over, and he was
without a job. He went to work for Kaiser Permanente, which had a plant
here in Los Altos. We were only here about two years and he was
transferred to Louisiana, so we went to Louisiana for six years.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

Where in Louisiana? Baton Rouge?
[00:24:30] Yes.
Baton Rouge? Not even New Orleans. That’s a big shift from here to
Baton Rouge.

21

McAndrews:

It was, yes. It was back to the 19th century and with a totally different view
of life. We were riding around looking for a house to buy and I saw several
new schools. I asked the realtor why there were so many new schools. He
said, "Those are for the black children." You see, Brown vs. the Board of
Education was decided in 1954 and this was 1956. Up until then there were
apparently no schools for the black children. When the Supreme Court
decision came down, they started building schools because they didn’t want
to integrate the white schools. That was, for somebody from San Francisco
which had always been liberal, a real eye-opener. It was also a grim view of
another way of life.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Did you work at all in Louisiana?
I just worked part-time here and there. My daughter was only six. I had to
be home when she got out of school. There were few worthwhile
opportunities in Baton Rouge anyhow for anybody. It was rather a sleepy
town despite being the state capital and any work I found would not be very
interesting. I worked for friend once in a while that needed help in the
office, but that was about it.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

When did you come home?
In 1962. Our final decision to come home was made early in 1962. That’s
when the women, and the men, too, I guess, were marching, picketing the
schools to keep the black children out.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

In Louisiana?
In Louisiana. The white people were supposed to keep their children home
from school, but we weren’t going to send our daughter into an arena, nor

22

were we going to join the boycott and keep her at home. That was the final
straw. We decided that we would come back again to the Bay Area we
loved and there were many job opportunities. Space age businesses, due
mainly to the proximity of NASA-Ames and Stanford University, were
beginning to spring up and Blossom Valley was fast becoming Silicon
Valley.
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

Was your daughter in private or public school there?
She was in a private school, in a Catholic school.
When you came home in 1962, did you move back to this area or to San
Francisco?

McAndrews:

We moved to Los Altos. My husband found a job with United
Technologies, which was not too far away.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

What did your husband do for work?
[00:27:58] He did a number of things. He was an office administrator, a
contract administrator and he was a purchasing agent.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

You went back to work in 1968.
Yes.
What triggered your decision to go back to work?
[00:28:25] I stayed home for 16 years, and for 15 of those years I wanted to
go back to work. My daughter was a junior in high school and I no longer
needed to be there all the time.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

What did you miss about work?
It wasn't so much what I missed about work as how dull it was to stay at
home. Those years in Louisiana were like what 19th century provincialism

23

was all about. I really had nobody to talk to except my next -door neighbor
and what she had served for dinner the night before. There wasn't any
stimulation of any kind. When I came back here there was plenty of
stimulation but I wasn't able to partake of a lot of it because I had a child to
raise. So I helped out at school, and I worked in the principal’s office. All
part-time work. By the time my daughter was 16, I was really ready to go
back to work. What I missed most of all was the stimulation of workingwith people who were doing things and were interesting. Not that my
fellow housewives weren’t interesting, they were. But we were all busy
keeping house and scrubbing floors, and all the things that women do and
did. What was startling to me in Louisiana, other than the subjugation of the
blacks, was that nobody in my Baton Rouge neighborhood ever seemed to
read a book. There was one library: downtown and poorly patronized. I
went there on the streetcar with a suitcase to carry a month’s supply of
books. The friends that I made in Los Altos and Mountain View were
vibrant and interesting and belonged to book clubs.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

How did you get the first job at Stanford?
[00:29:59] I went into the personnel office and looked at what jobs were
available and filled out a job application. They said they would get in touch
with me. And they did in a couple of days. I interviewed with a man who
was in the publishing department. Stanford, like most universities,
publishes books. It didn’t sound like any big thrill to me and there didn’t
seem to be any potential for advancement, so I didn’t take that job. Then I
got a call a couple of days later to come to the real estate office. I had no

24

idea how Stanford was connected with real estate, but anyhow I went.
Within five minutes of talking with the young man who interviewed me, I
thought he was the nicest guy I’d come across in years and we just seemed
to be compatible immediately. He hired me on the spot and I accepted on
the spot.
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Who was this?
Boyd Smith. He was assistant manager of real estate.
You were hired first as a secretary or administrative aide?
I was hired first as a secretary, but I was made an administrative aide within
a very short period of time because there were only four people in the real
estate office, two men and their secretaries. There was a great deal of work
to do because things were picking up. The Industrial Park had been started
in 1951 and the Stanford Shopping Center, which had been operating for 12
years, was really beginning to grow. We were swamped. I was doing a lot of
things that were not secretarial, so I was made an administrative aide. Then,
as I recall, we hired two women to do the secretarial work and help with
clerical work. We were devising and implementing procedures, principally to
describe, record and maintain transaction histories.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

This was in 1968?
[00:32:41] Yes.
Was your daughter still in school then?

McAndrews:

She graduated from high school in 1969.

Leichter:

So by this time she was out of the house.

25

McAndrews:

She left home when she matriculated at Stanford. Until then, She was a big
help at home. She made it possible for me to go to work because she would
start dinner and do the shopping and help around the house. That was nice.
It made it so much easier.

Leichter:

How did you strike that work/life balance, going back to work after so
long?

McAndrews:

Just anecdotally. The night before I started work at Stanford, I cooked
dinner for the next day. My husband looked at me and said, "Are you going
to do that every night?" I thought, you know, he’s right. I’m going to have
to cook dinner every night anyhow, so why start the night before? I found it
exhilarating at first to have two jobs, really. My husband was always very
helpful which made it possible for me to manage.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

He was supportive of your decision to go back?
He was very supportive. He knew how antsy I was to get back to work, and
he was a great help. My daughter, while she was here at home, was a great
help, too. I found that I got a lot more done when I was working than
when I was home, because I had two jobs to do, but not enough time to do
either well, so I utilized my time carefully to make sure I got everything
completed.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

Were you the only female in the real estate office at that point?
I was the only female who wasn’t a secretary.
How did that dynamic work in the office? I suspect it was the same at
Arabian American Oil.

McAndrews:

Perhaps.

26

Leichter:
McAndrews:

How did you carry it off?
I found that hard work really solved most problems. You make yourself
invaluable and people respect you. I did my best to do that. I liked Boyd
Smith so much and respected him so much that I wanted to do the best job
I could. He was only 27 years old. I was 20 years older. It was kind of like a
mother/son thing. Because he’d spent time in graduate school at the
Graduate School of Business, he didn’t have a lot of work experience, but
he was a very intelligent, smart, hardworking young man. Working for the
Arabian American Oil Company was a university. I learned an awful lot
there. I had learned procedures that were well structured and useful, and I
installed those in an effort to keep things moving and organized. That was
appreciated.

Leichter:

Was there ever any tension between you and the other women in either
office?

McAndrews:

[00:36:31] I didn’t have an office of my own while Boyd Smith was there.
He was there for four years after I came, and Alf Brandin for two. So I
worked in the outer office for four years and then there was an empty office
when Boyd left. I put the map cabinet in there. He had a lot of
recordkeeping chores that had to be completed, and one of the jobs that he
gave me was to do an inventory of all the campus lands, which was an
enormous undertaking requiring special maps and lots of research. I had
bought a map cabinet to collate a multitude of maps from various sources.
The only place to put it was in Boyd’s now-vacant office. It was about four
feet high, or a little higher, and about six feet wide. It took up the front half

27

of the office. After a while I was working with the maps so much that I
went in there and stood up and used the top of the map cabinet for a desk.
There was still a desk in there and one day I sat down at the desk. People
had gotten used to seeing me in there and it didn’t seem to cause any
problem at all.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

When were you promoted to assistant manager in that office?
That was one or two managers later. I think it was when the next manager
came in, but it was a long time before Boyd was replaced.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Was he replaced by Alf Brandin?
No. Alf Brandin was vice president for business affairs and Boyd reported
to him. He was also a wonderful man. I used to say to people that when I
first came to Stanford, Alf Brandin and Boyd Smith were my bosses and I
thought it was always going to be like that. It sure wasn’t. Out of six real
estate managers, four of them were fired. I was so busy I didn’t even know
they were fired. I mean, I found out about it long afterwards. I thought they
left for other jobs.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

When were you promoted to assistant manager?
Probably a couple of years after the new manager came in. I received letters
that were written to me by people who all said the same thing: "It’s about
time."

Leichter:

What would you actually do as a manager of real estate at Stanford? What
did the job entail at that time?

McAndrews:

It was so complicated. It wasn’t one simple thing, I mean it wasn’t like
managing a real estate office, or just a shopping center, or just an office

28

park. It was all those things. Then in addition to that we had a variety of
outside properties that came to Stanford as gifts, or by bequest. They were
given mostly by alumni and had to be sold or otherwise managed in the
interval.
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Those were not contiguous with the university?
They were scattered all over, mostly in California.
You managed these properties also.
[00:40:26] Boyd had some of those. There was an assistant manager, and
he had the others. So when Boyd left, I took over his outside properties
plus some of his unfinished projects. I was also interested in the shopping
center. Nobody else seemed to be since Alf Brandin had left. Oh, I started
to say that he was the vice president for business affairs. He was the one
who really started the land development program at Stanford. Fred
Terman got credit for most of it. Terman deserved a lot of credit, especially
for recognizing how important the proposed industrial park could be, but
not all of it.

Leichter:

How did your earlier work experience prepare you for those first jobs at
Stanford?

McAndrews:

[00:41:34] I could only say that I must have had an instinct for it, because
certainly the areas that were covered were not anything that I had
experience with, other than office protocol and how to set up and maintain
records. I was given things to do that I had never done before. Even at the
Arabian American Oil Company, I assembled all of the corporate
documents, the founding of the company and the concession agreements

29

with Ibn Saud, the king of Saudi Arabia. Most of these valuable records
were scattered around in various offices and they all needed to be
assembled, titled, assigned file codes and bound in manuscript covers. I
must have seen the covers in a movie, because I don’t know where that
came from. I asked if there was any access to manuscript covers, and
somebody said yes. Anyhow, I titled and indexed all of them and officially
tendered them to the treasurer for safekeeping.
Leichter:

Did you have any mentors during your early career -- what you would call
mentors during that early period? It sounds almost like you were a mentor
yourself.

McAndrews:

Yes. At the Arabian American Oil Company I did have one man who was
the cashier when I was the assistant cashier. He was wonderful. He also
gave me an awful lot to do, which meant, come to think of it, that he didn’t
have so much to do. You learn when you have to learn. One of the things
about learning on the job is that you can’t ask a lot of questions. But you
have to learn the hard way. If you’re sitting at a desk in school you can raise
your hand and ask all kinds of questions. But when working, you have to
figure a lot out for yourself and this you never forget. It does require that
you have somebody who is there when you really need them. That’s what
this man was, a supervisor, a mentor and a friend.

Leichter:

How did your promotions occur, generally, at Stanford? Did you apply for
them?

McAndrews:

There was an assistant manager hired when Boyd Smith was there. Boyd
had recommended me for the position, but was told to "get a man." The

30

assistant manager and I didn’t get along very well. He posted a job for – I
forget what the job title was. Anyway, it was a step above me. I found out
about it because a friend of mine in the personnel department called me and
asked if I had applied for the job. I said, "What job?" and she told me.
That was the purpose of her phone call. I went in to his office and told him
that I was not going to be number three around there after all the work that
I had done, and he withdrew the posting. When he got fired, I got the job.
You asked if I was discriminated against in any way. As far as promotions
were concerned, it took longer, but as far as money was concerned, I
received about half of what a man would have been paid.
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Based on salary surveys or your knowledge of the industry?
Both and also based on what the man who succeeded me was paid.
Was this ever corrected?
The last man I reported to, who also oversaw a portfolio of off-campus
investment properties, was named Bill Phillips.

McAndrews:

[00:46:06] He was the last man I worked for, and the first man I worked for
was Boyd Smith, and they were both great. Bill Phillips did everything he
could to get what he thought was a decent salary for me.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Was he successful?
[00:46:25] Yes, I got a considerable raise. Then when I became fully
retired--I remained as a consultant for two years--I discovered that the man
they had hired to take my place was making almost 100 percent more than I
had made. I had been there all through the renovation and revitalization of
the shopping center, which had achieved a great reputation. He got a jewel

31

[sentence deleted], among the top three in the country, so most of the
creative work had been done. I had started with a twenty-year-old center
built with a very low budget of only $6 million. It was dowdy and not well
run. But it was beautiful when he got it and it had a great reputation.
[Laughter] When I found out how much money he was making, if I wanted
to, I could have sued, but I had relationships at the university. I loved the
university and I had done well there, other than in the money department.
So I would never dream of suing them.
Leichter:

While you were in the real estate group it sounds like you were the only
female administrator.

McAndrews:

Yes, for a time, until Robin Hamill assumed responsibility for the research
park (the Industrial Park was later renamed Research Park).

Leichter:

Were there other women at your level that you networked with at the
university?

McAndrews: No. Other than in an informal way, I knew women who had good jobs and
became acquainted with some and friends with others. In Encina Hall, in the
business office, I was the only female administrator until we were going to
remodel and revitalize the shopping center. [sentences deleted] Then I
became director of the shopping center and Robin Hamill was put in charge
of other campus properties including the research park.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

This is about 1977-78?
Yes. In 1976-77, the shopping center, in view of its planned renovation, had
become a full-time job, and Robin took the research park. The women on
my staff of five were invited to interview with Robin. And she offered a job

32

to Zera Murphy, whom I had hired several years earlier, and who was a very
intelligent young woman. Zera knew a lot about the park’s history and I
recommended her highly to Robin because Zera didn’t have any shopping
center experience, but she did have a lot with the research park. I knew she
would be helpful and be the institutional memory, which was important
when there was a changing of the guard. It was vital to have somebody with
experience. So my instructions to the people that worked with me were, any
calls they got from Robin’s office they were to answer to the best of their
knowledge and ability. They were not to slough it off or avoid answering.
They were to cooperate fully, and they did. Zera became Robin’s assistant
and was chiefly responsible for a smooth transition.
Leichter:

Rosemary, what I’d like to do is, I have maps here and I’d like to walk you
through the development of the research park, and also the shopping
center, specifically, including the development of the Inner Circle and the
Street Market specifically.

McAndrews:
Leichter:

Those are Rosemary’s babies.
I do have a few other questions about the role of women in the departments
at Stanford and what your impressions are of that generally. When you met
with other women at the university, say the Faculty Club for lunch or
wherever, did you discuss issues that were of concern to women at the
university specifically, such as the inequality in pay or other issue you’ve
talked about?

McAndrews:

I don’t remember ever discussing it. I think the real women’s movement
had not gotten up much of a head of steam by then. That happened

33

afterwards when the murmuring became more audible. When I was with
other women we were playing bridge at lunchtime or doing something that
didn’t have anything to do with the university. Frankly, my time there was
was usually taken up with working. I didn’t have much time for chitchat.
All of my staff worked hard and were all very good. A couple of them are
still there.
Leichter:

Could you describe your working relationship with Colbert Coldwell? Do
you recall?

McAndrews:

He was an old man when he became associated with Stanford. He was a
Cal graduate and I understand there was a lot of joking going on about
working with Stanford. I never met him. He worked with Alf Brandin and
he became real estate advisor to the university. His successor was George
Stauss.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

That was my next question.
[00:55:20] George Stauss was a wonderful man. I recently came across an
excerpt from a speech he gave at his retirement party: "Although over the
years I worked with at least six real estate managers at Stanford, none was
more diligent and competent than Rosemary McAndrews. And above that
she had a wonderful sense of humor. She was truly one of Stanford’s most
valuable assets, given that at one time she was responsible for all of the
university’s non-academic properties, including the industrial park and
shopping center!" George saved my neck many times. He was so helpful, a
real gentleman, generous with his knowledge and a true friend.

Leichter:

You did work with George?

34

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Yes.
In what capacity?
In his capacity as real estate advisor to the university. He was always there
somehow, whenever I needed information or advice. As real estate advisor
to the university, he inherited me. He was always aware of what the going
price was for industrial and commercial property and was mostly involved
with the research park, but not with the shopping center at all because that
was out of his area of expertise. It was very important to know what prices
for prime real estate were and he had all that information. I learned from
him how to capitalize income, compute property valuations and translate
real estate jargon. He took seriously his being an advisor to the university.

Leichter:

Could you describe your working relationship, if any, with Richard Lyman?
Was he an active participant in the land development?

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

No.
Not at all?
I spoke to him a few times. That was about all. There were certain things
that were delegated to me. I could sign for so much money, I could sign
leases up to a certain amount. The Board of Trustees reserved to itself the
authority to execute log-term leases above a certain amount on behalf of the
university or to approve capital expenditures. It was my job to interview
prospective tenants, verify their financial and business competence,
negotiate lease prices and terms, and prepare proposals to take to the board
for approval. Capital expenditures for major renovations, their design and

35

business philosophy, for example, the Street Market required the board’s
authority to proceed, or not. Only one proposal was not approved.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Let me follow up on that. What did they not approve?
They did not approve my putting a theater complex along Sand Hill Road.
There was a lot of vacant land there, including parcels zoned for shopping
center expansion. The shopping center had not been fully developed and I
wanted to use it for theaters. It so happened that at the same meeting, the
medical school was proposing an expansion farther up Sand Hill Road. If I
were proposing expansion of an adjoining area and the city objected, which
they often did to any kind of development, then it was quite possible that
my doing something there would endanger academic expansion, which I
understood perfectly had a much higher priority. Anyhow, it was the only
thing they ever turned down. It was interesting because the president of the
board, either the president or the chairman of the land development
committee, saw me waiting outside as he was going in and he said, "Let’s get
that approval." I thought, "Oh boy, I’m home," so I was really surprised
when they turned it down. Upon reflection however, I felt that it was the
right thing to do.

Leichter:

I’m curious. Why did the Board of Trustees retain such power and not
delegate? For example, if it was a tenancy at the shopping center for a twoyear period, why would the Board of Trustees get involved with something
on that level?

McAndrews:

They didn’t at the shopping center, but I couldn’t negotiate a lease there for
more than 15 years. They reserved that right. There were many reasons for

36

that. One was to discourage leases longer than 15 years, which was a wise
move. The other was just from a financial point of view; it would always be
the university’s property, thanks to the Founding Grant, and you can only
look out so far. What will be happening with shopping centers in general is
unknown, whereas in the research park in order to get financing and make
long-term plans, the companies had to have long-term plans and leases. The
term started out at 99 years and then was reduced to 51. Now they’re mostly
annual payments, I believe.
Leichter:

Could you please describe your working relationship with Donald Kennedy
and was he an active participant in land management activities?

McAndrews:

I was there through all of President Kennedy’s tenure. He was personally
very interested in the shopping center and the changes that were taking
place: the indoor/outdoor environment with the introduction of flowers
everywhere, outdoor seating and dining, coffee houses – the philosophy of
"shopping within a garden." When shopping becomes pleasurable instead of
a chore, customers spend more money. At least that was our theory, and
President Kennedy seemed to enjoy the center, and spent more time there
enjoying the ambiance. I know this because he took time out of his busy life
to write me several complimentary notes that were deeply appreciated. He
was my favorite president. He took time to be thoughtful and to express his
pleasure.

Leichter:

Did you ever have a discussion with President Kennedy about revenue or
the atmosphere of the shopping center or developing that project?

37

McAndrews:

[01:04:17] No, and I think that’s a function of no news is good news. For
example, I kept in touch with Alf Brandin over the years and I asked him
once if he liked what was going on at the shopping center because that was
something that he started when Stanford was badly in need of money. He
said, "You haven’t gotten any calls from me, have you?" As an aside, besides
being revered by everyone who worked for him, his inspired efforts to
increase income by starting both (the then) industrial park and the shopping
center were enormously successful. The last year I was there, the shopping
center had the highest return on investment of any items in the investment
pools: 22.2 percent.

Leichter:

Are there any other individuals outside of the land management or real
estate office that you worked closely with in Stanford administration?

McAndrews:

I worked closely with the lawyers and with the planning office to ensure
legal and esthetic propriety.

Leichter:

In working with the planning office, segueing into my next question, were
you responsible for interpreting the Founding Grant’s restriction on
Stanford lands? Was that done in conjunction with the planning office in
terms of saying, "We can’t sell this land or dedicate it in perpetuity, so we’re
only going to have leases of a certain term?"

McAndrews:

Interpretation of the Founding Grant’s stricture in perpetuity against sale of
the land was accomplished long before I arrived on the scene and was
handled by the legal office, "Here it is to manage, but you can’t sell it."
That’s what it amounted to, and that was one of the wisest decisions that
were ever made with regard to Stanford University. I once went to a seminar

38

of real estate managers, university real estate managers. Most of them were
from land grant colleges and almost every one of them had sold off surplus
land during the depression years when they needed the money and five
dollars an acre was often within the sales price range. I think that the best
thing Leland Stanford ever did, aside from endowing the university in the
first place, was to say that the land couldn’t be sold.
Leichter:

In terms of the Founding Grant, was that really the only restriction on the
land?

McAndrews:

[01:07:02] I don’t believe there was any attempt to lay out any further
restrictions other than to establish a college and never sell the land. The
latter, a paraphrase of Governor Stanford’s statement, was because in
themselves the lands would be of more value and would contribute to the
financial health of the university. The word "health" wasn’t used, but that
was substantively what it meant. Some kind of income would have to be
generated because there certainly was no financial advantage to the
university if the trustees just sat back and paid increasingly onerous taxes on
surplus land. Using it and developing income from it, I think, was what
Leland and Jane Stanford envisioned.

Leichter:

It was primarily a financial endowment, not, say, using the land for greenbelt
purposes?

McAndrews:

[01:08:12] Not specifically. The main purpose, of course, was to build a
university there and use the land for that purpose, but aside from that, any
income that could be derived from it would be very helpful in securing the
best faculty and meeting the extraordinary expenses of educating students.

39

Leichter:
McAndrews:

It’s an extraordinary amount of money.
Yes. Just judging from inflation and local real estate prices in housing, it
must be worth $3 to $5 million an acre today. The last lease price around
1972 on Welch Road that I remember was about $159,000 per acre.

Leichter:

Rosemary, I’d like to get into specifically the Stanford Shopping Center and
the Research Park next. I have a map of the shopping center, I am sorry it’s
very difficult, but this is as large as they could blow it up.

McAndrews:
Leichter:

Let me get my magnifying glass.
Okay. I believe this is from about 1984. Looks like the Inner Circle has
been completed, but not the Street Market.

McAndrews:

[01:09:58] Yes, the Inner Circle was opened first. The Street Market was
fully operational by the mid 1980s.

Leichter:

Rosemary, you were appointed director of the shopping center as a full time
position in 1972. Why did you want that job?

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

It wasn’t 1972.
When was it?
I was still involved with the industrial park at that time. It was the late '70s,
early '80s.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Why did you want that job?
Because I had been doing it for a long time, and changes had been made in
my portfolio of properties as well. I just got the title. Nobody else seemed to
be interested in the shopping center. Boyd had left. Alf Brandin had left.
The new men that came and went didn’t seem to have much interest in the
center, and I thought it was fascinating. A lot more exciting than what was

40

then called the industrial park. So I got to know the property manager at
the center and when things came up he sought my advice.
Leichter:

Were there particular tasks associated with that job that you liked or
disliked?

McAndrews:

It was a shopping center and I was a woman. Only men had been involved
with it in its early stages and I thought it needed a woman’s touch. A lot of
people thought it was dowdy. The planning office thought it was and they
made the first suggestions for doing something about it. Harry Sanders was
the head of the planning office, and Harry and I were very good friends. I
admired him enormously. And I was interested in it just because it was a
shopping center and I didn’t like a lot of the things I saw there. I was over
there one day with the property manager. I looked around and there was a
small planter box about 18 inches by 5 inches. It had 2 dead cyclamen in it
and that was the extent of the landscaping, outside of the palm trees which
were spindly and unattractive. As I said, the planning office also thought it
certainly needed some touching up and we hired an architect and design
experts to come up with what we could all agree was a great plan.

Leichter:

When you were first appointed director of the shopping center, was there a
reaction on campus? Was there support of your appointment or criticism?
Do you recall any?

McAndrews:
Leichter:

No.
I understand from some of the articles that I’ve read that you focused on
creating the right mix of tenants at the center.

41

McAndrews:

[01:13:48] That is the most important thing that a shopping center manager
does.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

To create that synergy.
To have the stores relate properly to each other, not to over-weigh one
category and under-weigh another one. Just the right balance. It’s a very
tricky kind of thing to do.

Leichter:

When you first saw the dowdiness of the center and the tenant mix there,
what did you think you could achieve in terms of a different mix? What
were your objectives?

McAndrews:

First of all, I didn’t do this alone. I was a lowly member of a renovation
team headed by Jim Nelson who reported directly to Robert Augsberger,
vice president for business and finance. Both of them were keenly aware
that something needed to be done. Timing was the chief factor. Most of the
non-major tenant leases were due to expire in 1976, twenty years after the
center opened. Renovation was required not only of the building and
grounds, but more important, of the tenancies. In the retail world fads come
and go. Yesterday’s star becomes today’s also-ran, and bringing in the latest
and the best was vital to success. Jim Nelson played an important role in
pulling a design and planning team together. He and a few others left the
university while renovation was still underway and it was, more or less, left
in my hands. Some of the need for changes were so obvious – the
landscaping, or rather, the lack of it. Creating a relaxing, beautiful
environment by the use of flowers everywhere was key to soften the hardedged effect of concrete and macadam. In the early eighties, I was invited to

42

a White House gathering where Nancy Reagan presented a National Award
for Landscaping to the shopping center.
Leichter:

Were you looking for stores to serve a higher income level that what were
already there?

McAndrews:

The first thing one looks at is the appropriate tenant mix. The second
thing, which is really part of the first, is the demographics of the area served,
and Stanford certainly was not catering well to its neighborhood. The center
was in a high-income location and we had very few upscale stores. That’s
the reason Neiman Marcus came in. Then there were a lot of specialty
stores that we put in after Neiman Marcus. We signed the lease with
Neiman Marcus two or three years before they started to build it, so we had
time to look around for satellite stores. That’s what they call the small ones
that surround the anchor stores.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

You already had I. Magnin when you came on board.
[01:18:15] I. Magnin was one of the first leases and it was the real I. Magnin
then.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Yes.
Somehow it lost its focus and became very dowdy before they went out of
business.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

There was even a Joseph Magnin.
We had a Joseph Magnin too. That wasWhere the Inner Circle was.
Yes. When that became available, it was a big space to work to re-tenant.
Across the street -- the development, was it Bullock's first?

43

McAndrews:

The first store there was Saks. Bullock's came next. Then the Bullock's lease
was bought out by Nordstrom.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Then Saks was bought out by Crate & Barrel and Andronico's.
They weren’t bought out by Crate & Barrel. It was moved from its Street
Market location, and was after my time. Andronico's came in shortly
thereafter.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

What stores and concepts did you reject, Rosemary?
Many of the ones that were just dying to get in and were willing to sign just
about anything. I didn’t trust them as business people if they didn’t go over
the lease carefully to see what they were getting into. The reason I mention
this is because I wanted to make Stanford different, not just a lot of the
same chain stores that all our competitors had. A shopping center is like
department stores used to be. They were shopping centers in miniature.
The first shopping center was built in 1924, but they didn’t really start to
proliferate until after the war, in the 1950s. They were similar to department
stores, except they were anchored by department stores surrounded by
specialty or "satellite" stores. The department stores had started to go out of
the business of trying to cater to everybody. They closed their book, sewing
and appliance departments. Gradually they all tried to become Nordstrom
because Nordstrom didn't have anything but soft goods – clothing, shoes,
purses, and items like that. Later, gifts, food, and other rather exotic items
were added.

Leichter:

Did you use any of your experience shopping in New York, say at Lord &
Taylor, or Bergdorf’s or someplace else to create that atmosphere?

44

McAndrews:

[01:21:05] Yes. I loved going around to the stores in New York. I looked at
the stores in Midtown in New York because that’s where the classy stores
were, mostly on Fifth and Madison Avenues: Bergdorf, Bonwit Teller, Lord
& Taylor and Saks. And then Macy’s and Gimbels were down on 34th Street.
Anyhow, I was always interested in stores, how they were laid out and what
their reputations were. It’s just one of those things. I certainly had no idea
that I’d ever be involved in any way with a shopping center.

Leichter:

Were there any kind of stores that you actually rejected because of the way
they negotiated?

McAndrews:

The idea, the philosophy that I had was, it starts with department stores.
First you have the department stores and they’re all alike and try to do
everything. Then one comes along that’s really successful and not trying to
sell everything, for example, Nordstrom. Then the other stores began to go
out of trying to serve everybody, which made it possible to have some of
the goods and services they no longer provided in the smaller stores. I had
two guiding principles: I was not going to do anything short-term, make a
lot of money quickly without regard to long-term viability; make money
more slowly and have a shopping center that was different, that wasn’t like
all the other shopping centers. Just as the department stores were all alike,
the shopping centers were all alike. I wanted to have as many individual
owners whose merchandise would give color and flavor to the shopping
center, that would make it different, make people want to come there
because when they’re all alike you just go to the nearest one. I really wanted
to attract people from a larger area. I wanted to see owners behind the

45

counter because they have a lot more interest in the stores than the hired
managers.
Leichter:

Instead of big chain stores such as Disney, you prefer to see the cookie
place.

McAndrews:

[01:23:49] Well, I wouldn't put them on the same level, but that's an
example, I guess. At one time, out of 140 stores, there were 63 owner
stores, small stores. This was really unusual. For one thing, if you’re not a
masochist you sign up all the chain stores. They always pay the rent. Even
if they don’t do well they pay the rent. owner-occupied stores were often
stand-alone and they didn’t know how a shopping center works. They try to
operate independently instead of collectively and you have to educate them.
What are needed are entrepreneurs not mom-and-pops. Within that scheme
of things, you have to pick the stars. For instance, Banana Republic had a
store in Mill Valley. That was their only store. The woman who was my
Assistant Director and an enormous help to me, Carolyn Johnson, saw
Banana Republic and she told me about it. She was artistic with an eye for
attractively distinctive merchandise. We went to see it and we immediately
thought this is exactly what we’re looking for. Here were two gifted people.
He was a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle and had a talent for writing
advertising pieces. They put out advertising pieces that were truly
remarkable and fun to read. That’s an example of the kind of store we were
looking for. Different, run by gifted people with the chance to be
successful in this particular neighborhood.

46

Leichter:

It’s interesting the way you talk about the old-fashioned department stores
serving everybody. When you talk about a store like that I’m thinking about
Bloomingdale's in New York or Harrods, for example, still has a sewing
department. It still has an appliance department. It still has a food court.
Splitting those elements up into a shopping center I can see now what you
were trying to achieve by that to get the full effect. Were there any concepts
that you thought were just silly and not going to make it?

McAndrews:

[01:26:23] Oh, lots of them. The person with a concept for selling only
chocolate covered strawberries. There was an Asian woman who wanted to
sell her small food items that were presently being sold as street food in
White Plaza. Because she was connected in this way with Stanford, she
thought she should get special treatment. I tried to explain to her that that
was not the way we did our leasing. Because she had a Stanford connection
would be the wrong reason for leasing a store to her. If someone had a
connection we would appreciate that if you also had a desirable business. I
had a lot of people like that, but I never refused to talk to anybody. I never
said “no” at the outset. I didn’t waste a lot of time, but I would listen to
them, and then I’d know that I hadn’t missed the new Banana Republic.

Leichter:

One of the items I noticed was that the number of stores during your tenure
increased pretty dramatically.

McAndrews:

[01:27:42] It went from somewhere in the 40s to 140. Increased by almost
100 stores.

Leichter:

What was the philosophy behind that? Just to create that tenant mix? To
get more income?

47

McAndrews:

The philosophy was several-fold: to protect the property value by not letting
an important asset degrade any further; to pay for the construction cost; to
increase income to help support the university, and to be more competitive.
Income was always a part of it. We were classified as a regional shopping
center, which is the largest type. There are strip centers and neighborhood
centers. Regional centers were of a certain size and a certain philosophy. I
wanted to be different and yet cater to the same kind of customer. That
took a lot of doing.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

That’s a lot of stores.
That’s a lot of stores. I didn’t fully answer your question. The reason for it
was mostly financial. At that time, we were the only university that operated
a shopping center. The purpose was to make money for the general fund.
Stanford gets a lot of money as gifts or bequests, but a lot of it is entailed
for the benefit of specific academic departments. All of the income from
the shopping center went to the general fund. This made it possible for
Stanford to do a lot of things that it could not do if tuition were its only
income. Tuition paid about half the cost of educating the students. The
genesis of the shopping center was twofold. One, to provide income, and
the other to reduce the tax burden because all of Stanford’s holdings were
not zoned for university uses, which would make it exempt. The part of the
land that abutted on commercial areas, like El Camino, was zoned
commercial. Then the industrial park, that big swath of land behind the
campus buildings, was zoned for commercial or industrial uses. That made

48

the taxes very high. They were a terrible burden. This is what got Alf
Brandin looking for ways to provide more income to offset the taxes.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

To offset the taxes?
He had to provide student housing after World War II and all kinds of
things had been neglected and this took money. So the primary purpose of
this was to provide income.

Leichter:

I‘d like to focus on your leasing process. Did you conduct most of the
negotiations yourself?

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

Yes.
Are you a tough negotiator?
Yes. I had a reputation as a tough negotiator.
What was your philosophy about lease negotiations? Did you start from:
"this is our lease, take it"?

McAndrews:

No. Everybody who has a lease would probably like to do that. "Here’s the
lease, sign it," and then if they sign it, you don’t sign it on behalf of the
landlord. When you are the person who represents the lessor, you have a
carefully drawn lease to protect the lessor. But if someone is eager to sign
the lease without a careful examination of the terms, that’s an indication of a
poor businessperson. I had some idea that fairness was involved in the mix
somewhere, and I tried very hard to be fair, but the legalese I never argued
with. That was put there to protect the university, and I certainly wasn’t
going to do anything to take it out. And that was a lawyer’s job anyway.
[01:31:55] The business terms of the lease were my bailiwick. I had a leasing
agency in San Francisco, the Ed Plant Company. Had them for years. They

49

were wonderful to work with. They certainly knew the market and what the
going rate was. I always had a pretty good idea of what the price was going
to be. The price was different depending on how prime, or sub-prime, the
location might be.
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Do you prefer a longer or shorter-term lease?
Short as possible to reduce the risk for both parties.
Because of the option to renegotiate the rent?
Generally speaking, it’s not possible to have a 2 or 3-year term. There has to
be time enough to build the business and amortize the investment. Usually
the way to do it was short-term, five years, say, with an option to renew for
another five years provided the lessee met a certain sales quota. It wouldn’t
do the lessee any good, or the landlord, if they were paying more than they
should be paying for the space because they weren’t making their sales
breakpoint. That’s the level that you have to hit before getting into the
overage rent; then you’re a successful tenant. If the sales floor isn’t achieved
and it’s a six percent lease, the tenant could be paying 10 percent, and that’s
not viable.

Are there particular negotiations you remember as being good or bad?
I remember most of them as being bad.
Why is that?
[01:33:50] If they were real tough negotiators that meant they were good
business people, come to think of it, actually, it was pretty good, everything
considered. Considering that I was dealing, to some extent, with retailers
who don’t enjoy a reputation for being nice guys. There was only one

50

lawyer, and I often dealt with lawyers, who was absolutely outrageous. He
called me about something in the existing lease, and I said. "I’m not going to
talk to you. You’ll have to get somebody else to talk to me." That’s the only
real difficulty I ever had. He was terrible. Some people operate that way.
They think if they push you and bully you and you’re a woman, you give in.
That only gets you up on your high horse. Generally the relations were
pretty good.
Leichter:

Did you ever feel that anyone was treating you differently because you were
a woman?

McAndrews:

[01:35:12] Oh, I think some people thought they would take advantage of
that, but I think they learned rather quickly that that wasn’t going to happen.
[sentences deleted]
[01:35:31] I had a black tenant. I really liked him personally. He was a
terrible merchant, but I was told to put him in. I understood the reasoning
behind that, but I knew he wasn’t going to make it, and he didn’t. He didn’t
pay his rent. It was not my job to collect the rent, but the property manager
wasn’t doing anything about it. I finally was near the store one day and I
went in, and he was waiting on a customer. I waited to one side until he was
finished and the customer had left the store. Then I asked him about the
rent. Later on he said, "You tried to embarrass me in front of a customer."
[01:36:21] I said, [laughter] "There were no customers in the store." Finally
he said, "You’re talking to me like that because I’m a black man." Like that?
I had talked nicely to him. I hadn’t been rude. I said, "And you’re talking to

51

me like that because I’m a woman." That was the end of the conversation.
[sentences deleted]
Leichter:

Now, how did you manage the physical aspects of the shopping center to
contribute to the look and feel, the ambiance that you were trying to create?
Because it does have very distinctive lush landscaping.

McAndrews:

It had no landscaping, except for a line of palm trees and the two dead
cyclamen. That’s the reason we installed landscaping. We hired a landscape
architect and an architect when we re-did the shopping center, and the
concentration was on the open areas. We wanted to create a feeling of
beauty. We had wonderful weather and we wanted to take advantage of
that. The president of the Emporium, who’s no longer with us – the
Emporium’s no longer with us – threatened us if we didn’t enclose it. Jim
Nelson led the charge saying, ”We’re not going to enclose it.” Here we are
with this wonderful Mediterranean-like weather, and you want us to enclose
it and run up all the bills for air conditioning and heating it?
We just want to make it a beautiful place to be, where people can relax. This
wasn’t just Jim and me; it was all of us. There were a group of us who were
involved in the renovation of the center. The planning office, the architects,
and Jim Nelson, who was adamant. We succeeded very well, I think, in
doing what we wanted to do. We had the outdoor café atmosphere evoking
Paris.

Leichter:

You did receive the landscaping award in 1981 from the American
Association of Nurserymen. Were you surprised by that?

52

McAndrews:

Yes. I was surprised when the landscape architect notified me that I had
been selected as the owner’s representative, and he said, "You will be getting
a package from the White House." I was thrilled. My background had to be
examined to make sure I wasn’t going to blow the place up. There was one
person who had nothing to do with the improvements at the center and
tried to brush me aside so that he could go and get the award in my place,
but I knew what kind of a character he had. I had all my background
clearances before I told anybody that I was going. There was no time to
check anybody else’s background. But he did get a couple of vice presidents
together to discuss the whole thing. One of them, Dr. Rosenzweig, I love
him forever, said, "You go, Rosemary, and have a good time." Bill Massey,
the other vice president, fully supported my going also.

Leichter:

Switching to more mundane topics. Parking around the shopping center.
Could you talk a little bit about the need for and the development of
parking? Did that change over your tenure? And the traffic flow issues,
which I know have been an issue for a long time around there.

McAndrews:
Leichter.
McAndrews:

What do you mean by an issue? You mean traffic generally in Palo Alto?
Yes. And how that impacted your shopping center management.
First of all, just as a statement of philosophy, you don’t worry about the
parking when there isn’t any more space available. when there’s too much
space available, it means you’re not doing very well. The City of Palo Alto
has a ratio that has to be maintained. Eventually, in order to maintain our
ratio and provide parking for our customers, we built one parking deck
when I was there, the first one. The second one was built several years later

53

when new stores were added. At Christmastime, and maybe around Easter,
the parking gets very, very tight, but that’s because business is so good. You
don’t build parking for February.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

True. Did they extend Sand Hill to El Camino during your tenure?
No, but we worked on it all the time I was there. It used to be that people
would come in from El Camino and go through the parking lot to get to
Sand Hill Road. Our parking lots are built to parking lot standards, not to
highway or roadway standards, which means that they’re not as deep and
there is not as much macadam and sub-base. All the time we had to repair
them and this was expensive. That’s one of the many reasons for trying to
extend Sand Hill Road. It was about three or four years after I retired that
they finally got it through.

Leichter:

I remember driving around and around cutting by I. Magnin. Never
understood why it took them so long.

McAndrews:

[01:43:23] It took so long because the City of Palo Alto took the time it felt
was necessary to approve the project.

Leichter:

I’d like to focus a little bit on the Inner Circle. When Joseph Magnin went
out of business and left that spot, what was your inspiration for creating that
higher-level mix of tenants, that more exclusive shopping experience?

McAndrews:

The leasing agent, Ed Plant, who was very familiar with the whole country
as far as shopping centers are concerned, highbrow, low brow and middle
brow, recommended that we envision the area fronting El Camino as Post
Street in San Francisco. This section had always been the high-end area but
I. Magnin’s glory had faded. It had anchored this area for years and we had

54

Ralph Lauren as a prospective replacement at that time. Anyhow, when this
space became available we thought that a boutique area of really high
fashion shops like those in San Francisco: great purses, great shoes, and
different kinds of jewelry would go well. I can’t remember all of the things I
thought of then. We had to have an anchor store at the corner of a new
entryway bisecting the new building to attract people there, and a restaurant
in the middle to pull them through. So we got Wilkes Bashford initially.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

That was their first store outside of San Francisco.
Their only other store. Anyway, they were very high-end, and certainly there
was a market here for high-end clothes. They specialized in sportswear as
well as dress wear. Really unusual kind of men’s clothing. We thought it
would do well here, but it got turned down, not by the trustees. It never got
to the trustees.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

The concept itself got turned down?
No. Wilkes Bashford got turned down because Wilkes Bashford had
landlord problems in San Francisco. [paragraphs deleted] Ed Plant came to
the rescue because he had Ralph Lauren as a prospect. I went to New York
to look at their store in an old mansion in New York.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

It’s lovely.
Yes, just beautiful. They took the space and more than Wilkes Bashford
was going to take. Then we had a lot of small stores. The space was cut up
to accommodate boutique types of operations. We wanted to get the kinds
of tenants that would appeal to what were then called yuppies because they
had a lot of discretionary money and they were young and they would spend

55

it. We wanted to get stores that would appeal to them, and would not be
just everywhere. That was an extremely difficult thing to do.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Were you pleased with the way it came out?
No. I expected more of it than developed. I was disappointed. It was the
only thing I was ever disappointed about in the shopping center.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Why didn’t it develop the way you wanted it to?
Because the stores were not as successful as I wanted them to be. I thought
they would do better. But they were one-of-a-kind stores and when you
deal with one-of-a-kind tenants, you deal with people who are always like
this: They don’t want to spend money. When you’re not doing well you
have to spend money. You have to upgrade. You have to see that your
stock is fresh and clean. They were just on the edge of disaster all the time.
They were difficult to deal with. That’s one of the things about Stanford
that’s different, or was different, that we dealt with these nervous wrecks all
the time, whereas the chain shopping center owners--the people that lease
the center now have about 100 shopping centers--they go to the annual
convention in Las Vegas; they lease many stores in many shopping centers.
They’re not going to spend time nurturing stores with no track record.
These tenants were hard to find, they were hard to maintain, and hard to
keep going. The Inner Circle has been doing pretty well over the last few
years, but the initial tenants, many of them are no longer there. [sentences
deleted] Talbot’s, the Travel Store and Perspectacles are still there. The
Travel Store was a mail order business where they just sent out a brochure
and had no brick and mortar location. I happened to get one of their

56

brochures and I thought the merchandise was interesting and really
different. We had a traveler’s checks operation and a travel agency, and I
thought that would just complete the circle. I called them up and invited
them to come and take a look and talk to me, and they’re still there.
They’ve done very well.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Yes. Doing well.
The Inner Circle, it’s making its own, but it wasn’t the spectacular success
that I expected.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

The Street Market, however.
However, the Street Market was the number one category in the shopping
center for years. I don’t know how it is now because the concept has been
corrupted by moving non-food related stores in there.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Now, that’s not where Niven’s was. Niven’s was where it –
Yes, it is. Niven’s was the supermarket, an original tenant from the 1950’s.
It was there.
[01:53:40] Yes. The fact that we were able to get that lease back made the
Street Market possible.

Leichter:

Niven’s was where "M" is on this map. I believe. Yes, where Sigona’s is
now.

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

It was right where Crate & Barrel was.
Oh, it was over there.
Yes.
All right.

57

McAndrews:

The reasoning behind the Street Market was that, supermarkets had become
an anachronism in shopping centers. They just weren’t there anymore and
were not doing well and weren’t paying market rents. Niven's happened to
have a long-term lease, which we bought out. With Niven’s leaving
something else would leave with them, and that would be access to food. I
thought, I had been to Europe several times and seen the street markets of
Paris and Italy, and just thought they were absolutely wonderful and so
much fun. I wanted to recreate one here in a shopping center which was a
departure from the norm.
I got the idea mostly from seeing them in Europe, but also from going to
Berkeley to check out the food ghetto over there. I got to know one of the
shop landlords. He had four stores there, and one of them he operated and
he leased the other three. He was a great guy, very knowledgeable about the
food industry. I hired him to help us to find tenants. We went all over, to
Half Moon Bay, the East Bay, South Bay and San Francisco. I guess that’s
as far afield as we went. Anyhow, with his help we got a good group of
tenants. The mural on the wall, that was to –

Leichter:
McAndrews:

La Rue du Chat-qui-Pêche (The Street of the Fishing Cat).
[01:56:07] Yes, I saw that in Paris and I thought the muralist did very well
with the fish and the cat and the nameplate. The mural was my idea to
bring something of Europe into a hard-edge, concrete center to soften it a
bit and to create the illusion of a Parisian street. Then we had the cobbles
put in, and I got a good landscape architect and his company did the mural
and the painted pots and flowers, and then we had the real pots with live

58

flowers in them. My greatest thrill at Stanford was the street market, and it
was number one for a long, long time. May still be. They’ve cut off part of
the mural. Enough of that.
Leichter:

There is a different mix of tenants in there now, it’s true, although the area
with Max’s and Sigona’s and Schaub’s is doing quite well, and it’s a beautiful
place to sit in still.

McAndrews:

Yes. Schaub was a manager of a butcher shop in Los Gatos, but it was the
cleanest butcher shop I ever saw. We had a terrible time trying to find a
butcher. I remember being in a kitchen in San Francisco at 2 o’clock in the
morning. We had been talking for hours. Butchers generally are not
entrepreneurial, and these certainly weren’t, although the butchers
themselves were kind of interested, but their wives definitely were not. I
finally gave up on them and concentrated on this area. The man that helped
me with the leasing took me to see Schaub’s. They have been a great
success. I recommend their marinated sirloin. We had Monterey Market,
the vegetable store before Sigona’s. They were exceptional too.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Why did you include the Health Library?
[01:58:39] Because I sincerely thought we should give something back to
the community that had done so much to make us successful. The Health
Library was a good thing to do from many aspects. I admired the people,
like Jeanne Kennedy, who were involved with it. It was part of the
university, and it would make apparent the fact that the center was
community oriented. As a matter of fact, it got so much publicity that I had
to ask the promotion director to stop pushing the Health Library. We

59

weren’t getting any coverage for the other tenants. The library was so
successful. People really flocked to it and they really liked the idea. We
didn’t charge the library any rent. I mean it was a purely humanitarian, nice
thing to do.
Leichter:

The shopping center is very important to Stanford revenue streams. Other
than the board of trustees approval process, did the administration ever
become involved in your decisions or the way you approached leasing to
protect or increase revenue? Did they ever put pressure on you to do one
thing or the other?

McAndrews:

Very little pressure was put on. Once or twice a personal friend who was in
the retail business would lean on us a little bit, but they were good
businesspeople and never overt and never caused us any difficulty. As a
matter of fact, we appreciated the trustees' input.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

Oversight.
I think “interest” may be more appropriate.
Speaking of oversight, the City of Palo Alto does have regulatory oversight
over the shopping center. Could you describe your interaction with the city
over the years, and what kind of oversight they exercised?

McAndrews:

There are the zoning regulations of the City of Palo Alto. They very
carefully detail what you can do and what you can’t do. There’s what is
called a floor area ratio. You can put only so many square feet of building
on so many square feet of land. They have 100 percent control of that.
Any new development of any size that we wanted to do, because of its
effect on traffic, among other things, Palo Alto took a great deal of interest

60

in. We used to do everything we could to please them, even to the point of
taking things to them that we really didn’t have to, but we wanted their
input. That worked pretty well.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Built a lot of bridges.
[02:02:18] Generally speaking, the people I worked with in Palo Alto, the
staff, they were like they are anywhere. There were good and bad among all
of them. The good ones I really enjoyed. It was hard at times because it
was such a time-consuming process. When you’re trying to start a business,
or put a business in somewhere, time is the most precious thing you have.
When that’s all eaten up it makes it expensive and difficult, both for the
landowner and the storeowner.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

Do you recall any particular battles with Palo Alto?
Mm-hmm.
You do. Do you recall any ones you’d like to talk about?
No.
Okay. Rosemary, I do have questions about the research park, and then just
some general questions, if you’re okay for another 40, 45 minutes probably.

McAndrews:
Leichter:

Sure.
All right. The research park, as I understand it, opened in 1951, and you
managed it from 1972 to 1985. Is that correct?

McAndrews:
Leichter:

That’s the approximate period.
Again, I have a very small map of the research park if you need to refresh
your recollection about anything.

McAndrews:

Oh, I do. It’s been a long time

61

Leichter:

Yes, I’m glad you have a magnifying glass there. Why were you appointed
to manage the research park?

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

I wasn’t appointed. It just happened.
It just happened?
[02:04:00] I think it was a confluence of being there at the right time, lucky
accidents, people leaving, and I was the only one there who knew some of
the procedural things about the research park. People came and went and I
stayed. So I became the institutional memory, kind of. I remember going
to the Graduate School of Business once as a guest lecturer. I was asked
how I got my job. Then I told them how I got my job as I just told you.
I didn’t realize at the moment that they were asking me how I got my job so
they would know how to go out and get themselves a job, you know, "How
do you do these things?" What I should have told them was that getting a
job is a series of coincidences, being in the right place at the right time,
meeting somebody who’s helpful to you. It’s a series of things that are
often unplanned. They just happen.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

It sounds to me as if it was work that you enjoyed.
Oh, I enjoyed it. I don’t think you can do a good job if you don’t enjoy
what you’re doing. It’s not all fun and games, but it’s got to be interesting.
It’s got to be challenging. It certainly was both of those.

Leichter:

What were the significant challenges with managing the research park during
your tenure?

McAndrews:

[02:05:43] For one thing, I didn’t have a great deal of background, but I was
a quick learner, and I had the advantage of working with Boyd Smith and

62

Alf Brandin. Boyd for four years and Alf for two years. I couldn’t possibly
have had better people who were decent, honorable men who believed in a
fair deal for everybody. One of Alf Brandin’s precepts was you have to
remember when you’re sitting across from somebody at your desk you’ve
got to think of the guy on the other side, not just of yourself.
You have to execute a deal that’s fair to both of you. That was very similar
to something my husband once said. He was in the purchasing business and
he said, "You’ve got to think of the man who has to go back to the office
and tell them what kind of a deal he made, so you’ve got to be fair." It was
almost word-for-word what Mr. Brandin believed. I had a great deal of
respect for my husband as well as for Alf Brandin and Boyd Smith. What I
was able to glean from them was the moral backbone of almost everything
that I did.
[02:07:00] I tried to treat people fairly, to keep in mind that I worked for
the university, and that their interests came first, but not at the expense of
trying to diddle somebody else. The people who were coming into the
research park were very high-caliber people. There were always good
expectations. Most of them were a pleasure to deal with. They were good
businessmen, and they weren’t there to fool around. They were serious in
what they wanted to do, and it was just a matter of getting together on the
business details of the lease.
Leichter:

Did your management style and managing the park differ from your style
with the shopping center?

63

McAndrews:

[02:07:48] I think that basically, if that word means anything at all, they
were the same, because I was the landlord in both cases. I represented the
landlord, and to them I was the landlord, but I was dealing with different
kinds of people, sophisticated experienced people in the research park, and
in the shopping center I was dealing either with people who knew
everything about leases, and shopping, and selling, and people who knew
very little and were amateurs, more or less, but had a great deal of promise.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

What about the different industries? How did that affect you?
[02:08:40] It was wonderful working with the research park because once
the lease was signed that was the end of it. They paid their money. They
kept the property up. They did all the things that they agreed to do in the
lease. They paid a lot of money for their leases. It was a no sweat, no strain
kind of a thing. I got to meet some remarkable people. In The shopping
center, it was also trying to get the property manager to collect the rent,
keep the place clean, and deal with the people who came to the shopping
center, apparently, just to fall down so they could sue.
It was a totally different atmosphere, totally different world, and yet, I
enjoyed the shopping center because it was a challenge, and because the
results were so delightful.

Leichter:

One of the original purposes of the research park was to establish a
collaborative environment with the university for academic purposes, really
and the R&D purposes.

McAndrews:

They were almost equivalent, I guess. The financial burden on the
university was enormous. Something had to be done to get some income.

64

That was right there up front. When Terman became involved, when he
found out what was going on and he saw at once the possibilities for a
linkage between industry and the university. His students, for instance,
wouldn’t have to go back to Connecticut to General Telephone or
somewhere similar to get a job. They could get a job right here. Some of
the professors were involved in ventures in the research park also. That’s
part of the reason why I changed the name to the research park. It was
interesting because I changed the name, then I reported it to the board of
trustees. I read in the newspaper later on that the board of trustees had
changed the name. The only reason for doing it was because the industrial
connotations were kind of outmoded and plebian, and research is what was
actually going on there. All we did was rearrange the file and put new
names on the folders.
Leichter:

It’s a name change.

McAndrews;: [02:11:14] Anyhow, I started to say the professors were involved in some of
those ventures. Shockley was one of the professors who was involved with
a company. Poniateff – I can’t remember all their names. Aside from being
involved in the companies there, they were also involved in consulting,
which was very important I think. Also, there was the Applied Research in
the research park that came out of the academic research of the scientists at
the university.
Leichter:

Did any of these factors ever come up when you were soliciting tenants or
looking for tenants? Was that a selling point for the park, the access to the
academic world?

65

McAndrews:

[02:12:12] I wasn’t involved in the beginning of the park. The first lease
was in 1951 and I came 17 years later. The park was just beginning to take
off. At that time people were coming to us. We didn’t have to go out
looking for anybody. They’d heard about the Stanford Industrial Park and
they wanted to be there. A lot of the interest came from university
connections. Everybody knew about Stanford and that they had a great
engineering department and they wanted to have access to the faculty for
their mastery of their discipline, for their research capabilities and to their
students as potential employees. Fred Terman realized this almost
immediately and his enthusiasm helped to populate the Park.

Leichter:

Were there ever any actual lease terms that pertained to that academic
collaboration, such as we agree to hire 25 students for the summer.

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

No.
Nothing of that nature.
No. As far as I know, nothing of an onerous nature was ever a requirement.
Did many of the tenants have federal funding in the research park? Was
that ever a factor?

McAndrews:

No. I certainly can’t recall any. If they did have federal funding they
wouldn’t necessarily apprise us of that fact. It’s just a guess on my part. I
imagine that many of them did have federal funding.

Leichter:

But rental payments were not conditional upon federal funding or anything
like that?

McAndrews:

[02:13:55] No. They had to prove their stability as far as finances were
concerned.

66

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

Independently.
Well they may have worked with borrowed capital, which is customary.
When did the tenant mix start to shift from traditional electronics R&D to
more of an office use? Was that during your tenure?

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

No. The office use was after, if any.
It was after.
Yes. Let’s see. There were a couple of – I take that back a bit. I was
thinking of the ventures where the university was both the landowner and
the building owner. There were a couple of office developments put up.
There were office developments some on Page Mill Road, some on El
Camino. The idea was that they would be in incubators for the small
companies to grow into big companies. They would start out in the office
buildings, and then if successful, they would occupy their own buildings.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

I see. The original leases, I believe, were for 99 years.
Yes.
That’s what they used the capital to, to build the infrastructure with.
That’s right. None of the money to develop this was to come out of the
general fund. They had to find a way to get the money up front. That’s
why they had the prepaid leases, for which they were criticized later on in
the way people are criticized when somebody knows the outcome rather
than when they’re guessing what the outcome will be. They were criticized
for not charging 1990 prices in 1950. "You didn’t charge enough." What
the market was at the moment is what we got, and that was top dollar.

Leichter:

Cost of living improvements.

67

McAndrews:

We paid for all the installation of the infrastructure in the streets, the roads,
and the utilities. We also maintained them, but only in the public areas.
Maintenance of the leasehold itself was, of course, the entire responsibility
of the leaseholder. The city may have done some of the work, but the cost
was borne by the lessee.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

During the term.
During the term of the lease. Yes.
And the utilities were dedicated to Palo Alto, so they took care of all those
improvements anyway.

McAndrews:
Leichter:

As qualified previously, the lessees paid the costs incurred.
What was your personal strategy for the long-term viability of the research
park?

McAndrews:

[02:17:15] As I said, we didn’t go out looking for people, at least during my
tenure there. They came to us. It was our decision as to whether they
would be a part of the park or not. If they were well endowed financially
and seemed to have a good idea that would be successful - you don’t want
to put potentially unqualified people in an expensive area that you’re trying
to develop as a series of small parts making up the whole.

Leichter:
McAndrews:

Did you ever turn down a lease application for the research park?
Not that I can recall by name, but the man who was real estate manager
when Intel was flying high turned Intel down. I was astonished.

Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

They turned Intel down?
Yes.
Wow .Why?

68

McAndrews:

I don’t know. They were prime. He probably had his own reasons for doing
it. I need to stop and think for a minute. There were times when we
couldn’t come to an agreement. There was also something that Alf Brandin
said that was very cogent, too, and that was, "don’t make too good a deal."
If you charge too much more than the market rate, then you’re not working
with good business people. He was so right, because we did have people
that came and they were willing to pay anything. That made us suspicious.
Made me suspicious, anyway. We did credit checks as part of our
background investigations, and they revealed viability or lack of it.

Leichter:

In regards to relations with the City of Palo Alto when you would develop
or lease a site her, did you have to enter into individual development
agreements for each site with the City of Palo Alto? Did you have to
negotiate with them every single time?

McAndrews:

[02:19:45] No. That would have made it impossible. I’m trying to
remember what plans they approved, but can’t at the moment, other than
esthetically in a few prominent locations. We had certain rules and
regulations for the park, how it was to be developed, how much landscaping
would be required, what the setbacks would be. The city was aware of all of
those. Other than trying to get them going to approve things and not take
so much time, I don’t remember any other required agreements.

Leichter:

Okay. Hazardous materials surfaced shortly after you left management of
the park. What was the awareness and thinking of the issues during your
tenure? Was it just people weren’t really aware of that at that point?

McAndrews:

Weren’t aware of what?

69

Leichter:

Hazardous materials, contamination issues, dumping of chemicals, things
like that.

McAndrews:

Oh yes. That did happen during my tenure. I remember when I found out
about it. I had letters hand-delivered that day to everybody in the park to tell
them to do a search immediately, find out what the condition was in their
property, and to report at once to the university. We first suspected that
something was going on because the land was beginning to sink a little bit
here and there. It turned out that the people that were making calculators,
the chemicals that they used to wash the parts were just being put down the
sewer pipes, which was absolutely the wrong thing to do. That occurred
just shortly before I turned over the management of the park to Robin
Hamill, so I don’t know the details of the final outcome. I know that
Robin’s office certainly kept after them.

Leichter:

Okay. The way industry operated in the valley. Rosemary, you’ve been
actively involved in the Stanford Historical Society since your retirement.

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Yes!
What interests you about Stanford history?
Everything. It was unusual that a university would be founded by a private
couple. I don’t think that occurred much. Maybe it did in the early days, in
the 18th century, but that was unusual. Stanford is such an important part of
the peninsula. I mean, what would we be without Stanford, really? We
wouldn’t be Silicon Valley. Of course, that wasn’t evident at that time. I
was just interested in finding out. I guess my main thing I have to contend
with, and has stood me in good stead, is being curious. If I hear about

70

something, I like to find out everything about it. When I started at Stanford
there were two secretaries in the department. The other secretary wouldn’t
tell me anything. For instance, I saw the man who turned out to be the
property manager of the shopping center; he was coming in all the time to
see Alf Brandin. I asked her who he was, and she wouldn’t tell me. At that
point I knew I was in trouble. Boyd Smith and Bob Riley--Bob was the
manager and Boyd was the assistant manager, they asked me how I was
getting along, or they asked me some question that I couldn’t answer. I
think this is the way it was. Bob said, "Ask Kay." I said, "She won’t tell me."
Then they were going to say something to her and I said, "No, it’s my
problem". I read the files, and I learned more from reading the files plus it
aroused my curiosity about the whole beginning of Stanford, everything. I
realized how much land they had. This was in maybe the second or third
month that I had been there. I hadn’t gotten a big workload yet and I had
time to read the files, and they were very revealing. I learned a lot from that.

McAndrews:

What have been your favorite projects to work on at Stanford?
The Street Market.
No hesitation?
No.
Any projects with the historical society that have been your favorites?
No. I became president after Alberta Siegel. That was a tough act to follow.
She was amazingly wonderful, intelligent; the smartest person I ever met.
She was kind and giving. She just was so helpful to me; I can’t describe it to
you. I admired her so much. As I say, she was a tough act to follow, so I

71

had to really scramble to try to do the best I could. I came in as vice
president, so I only had one year to learn the ropes, and that wasn’t really
enough, but with Alberta’s help and an abounding curiosity, I was able to
keep my head above water. Unless you’ve been with the society for a while,
it’s hard to learn all the great things that they do to preserve Stanford’s
heritage.
Leichter:

Was there anything while you were president of the historical society that
you were particularly proud of what you did?

McAndrews:

Obviously, if I have to stop and think about it, I guess not. Keeping my
head above water was what I was proud of being able to do. Oh, and one
thing I did. When I was on the Promotion Committee I did suggest the
conversations that we had that were really a takeoff on the KQED Tuesday
night interviews. Anyhow, that went over very well. I remember one
program that we had with Bill Stone questioning Don Kennedy. If you
know Bill, he has a wonderful, funny personality. I mean really clever. That
was just the most wonderful program I thought, well, now, if I suggested
this, that’s pretty good. I didn’t execute it, but I knew the right people to
ask.

Leichter:

Do you have any physical memories of Stanford you’d like to share? If
someone said, "what’s your favorite physical memory of Stanford?" Walking
through the Quad, or walking through the Street Market?

McAndrews:

When I was in Encina Hall, I went in there at eight o’clock in the morning,
and sometimes I came out at eight o’clock at night. As far as skipping
around campus, I didn’t do much of that because I didn’t have time. Then

72

when we moved downtown, I spent more time at the shopping center. With
the renovation of the shopping center turning out so well, that was my
favorite part of the job. As far as the physical beauty of the campus, or
campus as a whole, I loved Memorial Church. I thought that was just the
most beautiful space. I’ve seen the cathedrals in Europe, and it gives them a
run for their money. I used to go to services there on Sunday. I enjoyed
what they call the academic atmosphere. I don’t know exactly what that
was, but I enjoyed it, whatever it was. I used to enjoy going to the Old
Union while it was still the Old Union. I used to go to gatherings there
once in a while. I can’t remember what they were about now. The whole
atmosphere I enjoyed. I loved going to the bookstore. That’s something
that I sometimes did on my lunch hour so I got out on campus. That’s
about it.
Leichter:

Is there anything else you’d like to share with us that you’ve been doing
post-retirement?

McAndrews:

At one time I was on five boards. It was inevitable that it all came together
so that in the same week all five boards were meeting. I thought I was
overdoing it a bit, but I enjoyed what I did. Some of it was helpful in my
job. Some of it I felt I was being helpful in doing a good thing. I was on
the board of Avenidas. I enjoyed that. I was a consultant to the Allied Arts
Guild, and I met some lovely people there and really enjoyed them. I still
see some of them. I was on the North Bay Shore Advisory Committee for
Mountain View.

73

[02:30:21] At that time, where the business park, Google and the rest of
them are, was just a dump. I mean people threw whatever they wanted to
throw there endlessly, and it was just a mess. I thought the city did a
beautiful job in cleaning it up. I was on the Visual Arts Committee in
Mountain View. We got some really great sculptures. The city built a new
library, and the Visual Arts Committee was responsible for recommending
the art. We have some beautiful things in the library, wonderful paintings.
The best thing that we have, I think, are the sculptures. I knew one of the
artists because he created some sculptures at the shopping center.
[02:31:15] That’s something else. I brought art into the shopping center.
The fat guys on skateboards, and the frogs. We were going to meet the
sculptor for the frog sculpture out near Neiman Marcus; he was a
ceramicist. We were going to meet him at the restaurant in front of the
shopping center for brunch. We waited, and we waited, and we waited, and
he didn’t come. Finally I went outside looking for him, but I didn’t see
anybody that I – I couldn’t identify him anyhow, but I thought I might see
somebody peering around. I came back in. Professor Elsen was helping us.
Albert Elsen.
Leichter:
McAndrews:

Albert Elsen?
Yes. A great friend. A great man, I thought. I admired him. I said I
couldn’t find him. He said, "Let me go look." He went out and he came
right back with the artist who was in overalls. Professor Elsen said, "I know
what an artist looks like."

Leichter:

He should.

74

McAndrews:
Leichter:

Yes, he should.
Those are all the formal questions I have, Rosemary. Is there anything else
you’d like to add or talk about?

McAndrews:
Leichter:
McAndrews:
Leichter:

I probably told you more than I should.
Never. I’m sure there are lots of good stories still.
Yes.
OK. This is Helene Leichter, and I’m signing off now.
