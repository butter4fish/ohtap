Schofield: Today is January 3, 2013. This is Susan Schofield with the Stanford
Historical Society Oral History Program, interviewing Judy Sterling Plunkett.
This is part of our Presidential Families Series. We’re talking to spouses and
others who lived or worked in Hoover House about their own experiences
and reflections of those times and of the president, in your case your father,
J. E. Wallace Sterling.
Why don’t we start by having you tell us a little bit about your family
structure, your early family life, your siblings, when the family came to
Stanford, etc.
Plunkett: [00:00:49] Perfect. Dad came to Stanford from the Huntington Library in
1948. My mother, Ann Sterling, was joined by my brother, Bill Sterling, and
this is in order, my sister, Sue Sterling, and myself. I was four at the time that
we moved to Stanford.
Schofield: And how old were they?
Plunkett: [00:01:16] My sister is three years older. My brother is five years older. I
think a wonderful family joke was on the day of Dad’s inauguration. It
happened to be April Fool’s Day. The Palo Alto Times covered the event and
12

reported that Mrs. Sterling and son, Bill Sterling, and the “two-headed”
daughters were in the audience. Of course, we were very blonde, and they
misspelled “tow-headed.” So the family joke was that Dr. Sterling had a son
and two-headed daughters, a great beginning. But also the fact that he was
inaugurated on April Fool’s Day, we thought was pretty funny.
Schofield: And that would be 1949?
Plunkett: [00:02:07] I think it was ’48, but double check that. I’m not sure.
Schofield: I read that he was offered the job in November of ’48.
Plunkett: [00:02:19] Okay. Then I trust your fact. But I do know it was April 1st. So
Mom brought her young children to the Lou Henry Hoover House. I don’t
have a distinct memory of arriving because I was only four, but what really
informs my memory is growing up believing that this “summer house” of
many stories and many terraces was designed in part because Mrs. Hoover
was a Girl Scout and loved the out-of-doors. So it seemed as though most
every room opened to the outside. That’s a very strong memory.
As a little person, it was fabulous because you had three floors to run
around and get into trouble or use your imagination and enjoy it, with many
of these rooms opening to a terrace. The architecture was really interesting.
I also thought for a long time I lived in a Hopi pueblo because it has that
kind of white-walled feeling about it.
Schofield: It does indeed.
Plunkett: [00:03:40] So it was great fun to be a Stanford “Indian” living in a pueblo. It
all made sense to me, it all fit.
Schofield: That’s cute.
13

Plunkett: [00:03:51] So one of the challenges I think Mom faced was how to make an
institutional house a family home, and she did a remarkable job. I remember
her struggling with the budget the university gave her. I can see her now in
the upstairs office that faced out over Mirada Road, the circle there, doing
pen-and-paper arithmetic to do her monthly accounts for the Stanford
budget that the President’s house was given. She had to run the house on an
allowance.
She was very successful, I think, in creating a home for us inside of
this crazy institutional operation that she managed. We had formal dinner
every night except Thursday and Sunday (cook’s night off), and when I was
old enough to be deemed worthy of sitting at the table, dinner was at six
o’clock, always.
Schofield: In that big dining room, slightly elevated?
Plunkett: [00:05:12] In that long, wonderful dining room. Boris the butler, his name
was Kosta Boris, was a Serbian prince who in World War I had to flee his
country and his family’s holdings. Mr. Hoover [Herbert Hoover] met him in
connection with post-war food relief. Boris went into Mr. Hoover’s service
as his valet. So when the Hoovers used the house truly as their summer
residence, Boris would come with the Hoovers to serve Mr. Hoover. Boris
married an Irish woman named Essie, who had the bluest eyes you could
ever imagine. At some point, he left Mr. Hoover’s service. I don’t quite
know when that was. [Ed: in 1934.] He was the butler at Hoover House, and
he became one of my dearest friends.
Schofield: Boris, not Essie?
14

Plunkett: [00:06:13] Oh, Essie, too, but Boris was more visible than Essie. And then
there was Marie Reid, the cook. Marie was from Texas. Her son, Jimmy, was
one day older than I was; Marie and Jimmy lived in the apartment below the
garage.
The reason I’m going through all these people is to help you see that
I had a large “family,” because the staff became part of my family growing
up.
Schofield: So they had a real role in helping you kids grow up and taking care of you?
Plunkett: [00:07:00] Well, they were there. They were just visible and part of the
family, and part of my growing up was learning how important everyone is.
Mom would never, ever permit any of us to imagine that we were spoiled
little anythings because we had people in the house that helped us. These
were simply wonderful individuals that helped the house run. We really
learned to respect that.
There was also Vicky Hammer, the upstairs maid, and she wore a
black uniform and a very crisp white apron, always. And there was a
houseman, but I’m blanking on his name at the moment. But it was mainly
Boris, Boris and Marie also, but Boris in particular resonates with me because
he stood steel-rod straight. He was probably six foot-three. There was an
elegance about him that made him very important to me, very important, and
I would sit with him.
Schofield: Was he almost like a second father figure?
Plunkett: [00:08:25] No, no, but he was just a very important man in my life growing
up.
15

Schofield: What were his duties, his role?
Plunkett: [00:08:33] He would keep the silver polished, and I would find a stool and sit
next to him sometimes and help him. He worked with Marie, the cook.
Mom did all the menu planning. The food came from the Stanford
commissary. And Piers Dairy, Mr. Piers ran his cattle on Stanford land, and
the Piers Dairy truck would come to deliver the milk. But Mom planned all
the menus based on her allowance, and she and Marie would confer on the
meals. Boris would, therefore, know that he was setting a table for five or
eight or however many.
Another overriding memory is that we never knew who would be at
the dinner table at six o’clock. So it was expected that our manners were
polished at all times, because you never knew who was sitting there. And, to
Mom and Dad’s great credit, in my memory, it would be simply that I was
introduced to Mrs. Schofield. I did not know, perhaps, that she was the
daughter of Mrs. Rockefeller. None of that was ever presented.
When Monty Spaght [Monroe Spaght], a great family friend, would
come to the table, I had no idea he was head of Dutch Shell, and that’s very
important to me because Mom and Dad raised us to respect people. No one
was any better than anybody else, if I’m making sense.
Schofield: Yes, you are.
Plunkett: [00:10:30] When my sister and I were old enough, there would be times when
Mom and Dad’s obligations would take them out of the house, and we
sometimes had to be the hostesses for whomever the visiting guest was at
dinner, and there are stories that go along with that. But I think that what
16

has stayed with me, and very much a tribute to them, is having to do all of
this institutional entertaining, but they did it in a way that was so personal
and personable both. Mom arranged all the flowers in the house herself. If
you think of how the house is run now—
Schofield: I think things have definitely changed.
Plunkett: [00:11:20] —it’s extremely different, and for reasons I totally understand.
But during Dad’s time as president, anyone who came to the Hoover House
came to a home, and that meant a lot to Mom to maintain it that way.
Schofield: Do you think they enjoyed the entertaining, or did it seem more of a burden,
or a bit of both?
Plunkett: [00:11:42] I think one has to remember this is the generation of adults that
lived through the Depression, and so “duty” was an operative, living word.
You did your duty, so if the job asked that you entertain a lot, you did it.
You didn’t complain. You did it.
Schofield: Do you think they got to pick the guests, or do you think somehow down in
Building 10 it was decided, “Okay, these people need to be entertained?”
Plunkett: [00:12:16] Oh, gosh, no. I would think certainly in the early years as Dad was
building his team of advisors and figuring out how to develop the university,
he would have been very much in charge of with whom he needed to “grip
and grin” and who would be invited to dinner or to stay over. It was very
much a team effort.
Schofield: I was going to ask if there were often guests who were accommodated
overnight or longer?

17

Plunkett: [00:12:50] I think my memory says probably overnight, not necessarily longer
as a rule. But Mom and Dad were at a place where they needed to do
whatever was needed to build relationships, and then in that way build the
university. So it meant a lot of face-time entertaining.
Schofield: Do you recall any special guests or special events?
Plunkett: [00:13:23] Oh, yes. You’ll love this one. I don’t know the circumstance
behind it, but there was one occasion where the actor Victor Mature came to
the house. My older sister had quite a crush on him, so we teased her
unmercifully and referred to him unkindly as “Victor Manure.”
This particular evening when he came to the house, she was so
flustered that she said, “I’m delighted to meet you, Mr. Manure.” There was
always a lot of play, a lot of play.
And yes, there were CEOs. I think one particular stretch for the
whole household was when the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester came to
visit. There was an advance secretary representing the Duke and Duchess
who had to survey the house and almost do a security scan. Mom and Dad,
being Canadian, were, of course, delighted to imagine anyone in the royal
family would come to visit. That was pretty high stakes. Prince William was
their son who attended Stanford.
Schofield: Dr. Sterling, he had British ancestry, didn’t he? Or maybe they both did.
Plunkett:

[00:15:06] Both of my parents were Canadian. My mother’s family was
“Pennsylvania Dutch,” and they were loyal to King George III. During the
revolution the family left Pennsylvania and fled to Canada because they were
Loyalists.
18

In my father’s case, his ancestry is Scottish, primarily, and his dad was
an Englishman, a Methodist minister, who immigrated to Canada. As a
young man, he had worked in the coal mines in northern England, which was
very hard on his health, so he immigrated to Canada and became a Methodist
minister.
Schofield: As a family, did you see much of these grandparents?
Plunkett: [00:15:58] By the time I was born, neither grandmother was alive. My
maternal grandfather Shaver was alive and still lived on the farm where my
mother was raised, eldest of five. My paternal grandfather was a retired
Methodist minister. Both came to Stanford for Dad’s inauguration, and
actually that was the only time, maybe one other, when I met my paternal
grandfather.
Schofield: You didn’t take family vacations or trips to Canada?
Plunkett: [00:16:47] Not routinely. There was one family trip through Detroit to pick
up a new car that then took us into Ontario, Canada, where my mother’s
family’s farm was, outside of Toronto. So we met cousins at that point, but,
by and large, Mom and Dad stayed in touch through letter writing.
When Dad did his Ph.D. at Stanford and lived above Pop Warner, of
football fame, and Mom—
Schofield: In Pop Warner’s house there was a small room?
Plunkett: [00:17:27] There was an apartment over his garage, as I understand it. And
Mom taught chemistry to premed students at Stanford while he was working
on his Ph.D. They really developed a fondness for the area, and then Dad

19

took a position teaching history that brought him to southern California at
Caltech.
But, anyway, back to the house. I’m digressing.
Schofield: No, no, that’s fine. All of these things are good. What about back to the
house in terms of neighborhood, did you have family friends who lived
around you? Were there connections with other Stanford faculty families?
Plunkett: [00:18:06] Sure. My brother and sister and I all attended Stanford
Elementary School, where a lot of the faculty kids went, so we were all sort
of faculty brats together. A number of these families lived near the
president’s house. So the swimming pool was always lively in the summer,
full of faculty kids. So, yes, we maintained a lot of friendships with faculty
children.
Mom started opening the house on Christmas Eve to—I guess I’m
going to say neighbors. I don’t think it was all faculty. I could be wrong.
But it was a Christmas Eve tradition, and we’d all gather and be together.
Then the tradition was to go to Memorial Church for Christmas Eve service,
and it was the faculty children who made up the choir. Harold Schmidt was
the organist, and two of the faculty children were chosen to do the readings.
I remember my brother one year did one of the readings, and so did Johnny
Schwartz, who was the son of Marchy Schwartz, the football coach.
Schofield: I don’t remember that name.
Plunkett: [00:19:40] Marchy Schwartz, in the fifties. Johnny Schwartz was a great
friend of my brother’s, and I thought he was quite fabulous—because he

20

could spell his entire name, both names, in one belch. And I thought that
was a stunning accomplishment, stunning.
Schofield: For a kid, that’s pretty impressive.
Plunkett: [00:20:02] He was five years older, and I was just dazzled.
So Mom started that Christmas tradition. She was also very instrumental in
starting the Faculty Wives Club, I think that’s what it was called. She started a
lot of things that brought non-professors together, so the spouses together,
the families together.
I can tell you who my neighbors were, I think. One retired professor,
Payson Treat, would give us lemon drops, so it was always fun to visit him,
and he was always gracious. He’d let these school kids in, and he would offer
us lemon drops.
Schofield: Interesting. Boris and Essie, did they live at the house?
Plunkett: [00:21:07] No, they lived in a little house in College Terrace.
Schofield: They came in in the morning and they left at night?
Plunkett: [00:21:15] It was Boris, really, who was the full-time employee, if I can put it
in those terms, and Essie would just help occasionally. She was busy raising
their only son, Richard, who was close to my age.
Schofield: So it was Marie—
Plunkett: [00:21:30] Marie, the cook.
Schofield: —who did live onsite at the apartment?
Plunkett: [00:21:35] Onsite, and then we always had a Stanford student.
Schofield: I was going to ask if you had Stanford students working there? Because I
know subsequent presidents did.
21

Plunkett: [00:21:43] Right. We always had a Stanford student. While Susie and I were
growing up, we had a female Stanford student living on the floor where my
brother and sister and I lived, and we went through a number of absolutely
wonderful, wonderful Stanford students. I don’t know how they put up with
us, but they managed. Then there would always be a fellow who was the
dishwasher. This was before dishwashing machines. I think the Sigma Chi’s
kind of had claim on that for a very long time. Both Stanford students lived
in the house with specific jobs, and I don’t know why this worked out this
way, but it seemed as though the female Stanford student would eat dinner
with us, but the dishwasher didn’t. There was a dining room for staff off the
kitchen, so and Marie and Marie’s son, Jimmy, would eat there.
Schofield: I’m trying to remember the house. I think it’s the bottom floor that has a
long, long string of bedrooms.
Plunkett: [00:23:07] Right.
Schofield: Is that where you were?
Plunkett: [00:23:09] That is correct. And Mom was very worried because my bedroom
ended up being at the very end of that long hall toward the swimming pool.
She was concerned, since I was the youngest, that she was terribly far away
from me. So the room right next to my bedroom was where the female
college student lived.
Schofield: Interesting. Did you get to pick your room? I wonder why you were in that
last bedroom?
Plunkett: [00:23:38] I have no memory of that. It’s a really good question. Well at first,
my sister and I were in the same bedroom, and then Susie, the older sister,
22

wanted her own bedroom, understandably. So I bet that’s it. My brother
was at the foot of the stairs, and there was a guestroom in between his room
and the next room. I can never quite remember. The house had eleven
bathrooms and thirteen fireplaces, or the other way around.
Schofield: And something like fourteen or fifteen bedrooms, I think?
Plunkett: [00:24:25] Yes, it’s really something. It had what we thought were secret
passageways, lots of fun. One of the first times I visited the house as an
adult was when the Hennessys were in their first year, and I showed Mrs.
Hennessy a secret door that she had not known about, which was fun.
Schofield: Oh, my goodness. Where does the secret door go?
Plunkett: [00:24:51] Nowhere. It’s off the living room, but it’s a storage area where the
wine had been kept because it stayed cool. But she didn’t know it was there.
Schofield: Talk a little bit, if you will, about your relationship with your mother and
your father, separately or together. Did Dr. Sterling, who was working
outside the house, share what he was doing with his children? Talk a little bit
about your relationship with him as a dad.
Plunkett: [00:25:24] Okay. I was very protective, I’m told, of his chairs where he sat. I
did not like other people sitting in his chairs. He worked long hours, and this
is, again, generationally specific. I had, I think, a normal relationship with him
as a father. He was phenomenally busy. So I would find my times when I
could be with him. One was in the morning. His routine was to have
breakfast at seven-thirty. Things were on a schedule. If I got up early, I
could sit with him, and he would be reading the newspaper and I could ask a

23

few questions. Then I would see him at dinner. I don’t think that’s terribly
uncommon.
Schofield: I think that’s quite typical of the times.
Plunkett: [00:26:34] He liked very much, when he could, to garden, and when I was
probably third, fourth grade-ish, I would make a point of trying to find him
in the garden and help him. We could earn a penny for every five snails we
collected.
Schofield: How cute.
Plunkett: [00:26:59] He would wear a Sears and Roebuck khaki-colored shirt and
workpants. There’s a great story about his being in his gardening clothes out
in front of the house one day on a weekend. Some visitors were driving by
and rolled their window down and said, “Excuse me, but is this the
president’s house?”
He said, “Yes.”
“Oh, is the president in residence?”
“Well, yes, he is.”
“Do you think there’s any chance we could look around?”
And Dad said, “Well, I can’t take you in the house right now, but I
could walk you around the grounds if you’d like to see them.”
“Oh, could we? We’ll park over here.” So he did the whole nine
yards. At the very end, the people said, “You’ve been so kind, could you tell
us your name, please?”
He said, “Wallace Sterling.” And apparently the look on their faces
was just classic. [Laughter]
24

Schofield: That is wonderful. What a great story.
Plunkett: [00:28:05] Yes, it’s a wonderful, wonderful story.
Schofield: There must have been gardeners also. Didn’t Stanford provide gardeners?
Plunkett: [00:28:14] Some, but this is the fifties and sixties. When we first moved
there, the lawn rolled down to whatever that bottom street is. I’m forgetting
its name. [Ed: Cabrillo] I don’t quite know how this friendship developed,
but Mom and Dad became great friends with Tommy Church, who was the
landscape architect that did so many wonderful gardens in the Bay Area. He
designed the present “retaining wall.” There’s a round-shaped wall that
created a flat lawn where a lot of the receptions were held. Depending on
the occasion, Dad would plan what he wanted the border to look like. He
was a really hands-on gardener. He loved it. It was very relaxing for him.
Schofield: That probably was typical of men who worked very hard and were very
focused on their work, whatever it was, and gardening was a kind of relief.
Plunkett: [00:29:30] Exactly. When I was—I’m sure I won’t be right on the age—
seven, eight, nine, years old—one of the faculty members made available for
purchase a log cabin in the Portola Valley Woods toward the ocean on the
other side of the hills, near Half Moon Bay. Mom and Dad bought it. So
suddenly, there was a getaway place for them, and it was a very simple place.
This is a funny story on me. I’m embarrassed, but I said, “Oh, goody, goody.
Now we can be like a normal family and do things ourselves.”
We as a family would go out there for the weekend. After supper
was prepared and enjoyed, Mom would say, “Okay, time to be a normal
family. Come help with the dishes.” Then I kind of thought, “Well, I
25

wonder why I said all that.” But anyway, it was a really important place for
them because they could just turn Stanford off.
Schofield: He didn’t drag a bunch of work there?
Plunkett: [00:30:42] No, he’d do projects. He really, I think, would mind-escape, and it
was a simple, simply wonderful place, nestled right in the middle of all sorts
of redwood trees. I don’t know why there wasn’t any prohibition against it,
but Mom would sit on the deck and she would point, and the pointing finger
meant, “Remove that tree.” So dad would turn into a lumberjack with my
brother, and both of them would really, really relax. Of course, this sounds
crazy, but no television. We had radio. We played card games. We played
dominoes, just simple stuff.
Schofield: Yes, “normal family.”
Plunkett: [00:31:31] Normal family, exactly right.
Schofield: It sounds like you did have a good sense when you were in Hoover House
that this wasn’t the way most people lived.
Plunkett: [00:31:37] Oh, exactly, and Mom and Dad made absolutely sure of it.
Absolutely sure of it.
Schofield: Did that cottage stay in the family?
Plunkett: [00:31:45] It did not. I’m trying to think. They sold it when the three of us
kids were relatively newly married, because they weren’t using it anymore.
They didn’t have the need. By then Daddy had retired and they had their
lovely house in Woodside.
Schofield: Do you have any recollection of him talking through some issue of the day
with the kids?
26

Plunkett: [00:32:17] I don’t have a strong childhood memory, no. I think we had more
of those sorts of conversations when I was a student at Stanford.
Schofield: Let’s move into that era, then. We can always circle back if you remember
things that would be great to include.
Plunkett: [00:32:38] I have one story that I want to make sure we include.
Schofield: Well, let’s do it now.
Plunkett: [00:32:42] This is the growing-up fun stuff. I mentioned that my brother was
great friends with Johnny Schwartz, the son of the Stanford football coach.
It was the tradition that if big game were at Stanford, the Berkeley president
would have lunch at the Hoover House and then go on to the game. So on
this particular Saturday, with big game being played at Stanford, my brother
Bill, and Johnny Schwartz decided to load up the “poop deck” over the front
door with water balloons.
Dr. Sproul was president of Cal Berkeley, a big man with a booming
deep voice, just a remarkable voice. When he approached the front door,
rang the doorbell, and Boris would have opened it, Bill and Johnny let loose
the water balloons and drenched him, just drenched him. So he enters
dripping wet, Boris sees this, and I’m sure he scurries off to get something,
towels, whatever, I can’t quite remember, but I think Dr. Sproul was
enunciating some foul words in his big deep voice. Meanwhile, Bill and
Johnny run. They’re running away from this. And Bill did not show up until
well after the football game. I don’t quite know what Daddy said to him. I
can promise you, though, there was the scold and absolutely the giggle.
Schofield: So your dad would have found that amusing?
27

Plunkett: [00:34:41] Privately, absolutely.
Schofield: So he had a nice sense of humor?
Plunkett: [00:34:46] Oh, my gosh, a tremendous sense of humor.
Mom got very fed up one night because Daddy was getting all sorts of
honorary degrees and this and that, and we three children were always getting
awards. She just had had it. So quietly one night she comes to the dinner
table, and she’s got these ribbons pinned on her dress. Doesn’t say a word,
and halfway through dinner, I think, Dad notices. His nickname for her was
“Kidder.” And he said, “Kidder, what’s that?”
And she said, “I just want all of you to know that I have won awards too.”
That’s it.
Schofield: A little back-and-forth.
Plunkett: [00:35:36] Many wonderful things like that. She had a signal with Boris—I
don’t know if she just did this when she was bored or when she thought she
could get away with it—but she’d kind of wink at him, and he would know
what this was about. Usually, there were guests at the table. After dessert
was served, Boris would come around with the silver salver and there would
be a little tiny tin of cigars, very short, small cigars. Why I can remember
this, I don’t know, but they were called Schimmelpennincks, a German kind
of little cigar, her private stash. And for the heck of it, Mom would light one
up. She would just do it.
Schofield: I’ll be darned. That was probably quite outrageous at the time.
Plunkett: [00:36:30] And she would just do it to be ridiculous.
Schofield: And your dad didn’t mind?
28

Plunkett: [00:36:35] No, he loved her sense of humor, loved her wit. It was subtle. It
wasn’t in your face. It was almost appropriate, right? But not quite.
Schofield: How would you describe their relationship, the two of them?
Plunkett: [00:36:55] A partnership that was stunning, just stunning. [long pause]
Schofield: Something that one would hope to emulate, and it doesn’t always happen in
one’s life.
Plunkett: [00:37:10] They were fabulous.
Schofield: So let’s take you to Stanford as a student. Maybe you’re seventeen, and it’s
time to apply to colleges. Both of your siblings have gone through this, and
all three of you end up going to Stanford. Was this just expected?
Plunkett: [00:37:36] Not at all.
Schofield: No pressure?
Plunkett: [00:37:38] No pressure. I went junior and senior year of high school to a
boarding school in Connecticut, and that was more of an expectation than
college.
Schofield: Had both your older siblings also gone to boarding school?
Plunkett: [00:37:55] My brother went to Andover for three years, primarily because he
was not being challenged enough in the Palo Alto schools. And my older
sister too. I don’t quite remember how this all started. But, anyway, I
followed suit and went junior and senior year to a school called Westover in
Connecticut. It’s still all girls, believe it or not. So I am there, and I applied
to Radcliffe, Wellesley, Smith, and Pomona was my backup.
Schofield: And not Stanford?

29

Plunkett: [00:38:48] Not yet. I was accepted, fortunately, everywhere, and I’m trying to
figure out what do I want to do. Smith had great art history, and I was
pulled to that. Wellesley seemed kind of hippie and groovy. Radcliffe, I
wasn’t sure. Pomona, okay, yeah. Then it occurred to me I had not been in
school with boys for a very long time, and Stanford suddenly seemed like a
good idea, and so I applied. It also mattered to me not to apply to Stanford
unless I knew I could get in to other top schools. It mattered a lot to me.
Schofield: So it wasn’t just the president’s third child, being let in. It was, “I got into
these other places.”
Plunkett: [00:39:54] Yes. So that’s what brought me to Stanford, boys, or so I thought
at the time.
Schofield: Did you live in the dorms?
Plunkett: [00:40:07] I was in Roble 1C freshman year. Sophomore year I applied to
Stanford in France, because French was my foreign language, and I was
denied, but accepted to Italy VII. I thought, “Okay, that sounds pretty
good.” So Italy VII was sophomore year—fall and winter quarters—and
when I came back in the spring—what did we do, draw for our housing,
right?
Schofield: Exactly. You got together with a group and you drew a number, and then
you got placed in student housing.
Plunkett: [00:40:57] That’s right. But everyone had already drawn. I felt a little bit like
an outlier. It was really kind of funny. I ended up, I don’t quite remember
how, at Hurlburt House. I lived there for the rest of my undergraduate years,

30

and I majored in art history. It was really great because there were maybe ten
of us total in the major. It was itty-bitty. I made great friends.
Schofield: Lorenz Eitner was head of the Art Department, I think?
Plunkett: [00:41:31] Was he then? I’m not sure. [Ed: Eitner came to Stanford as head
of the Art Department in 1963.]
[00:41:37] But I remember—gosh, was it Professor Rose, or was Rose her
first name? Anyway, dynamite classes in Renaissance Art. I just loved it,
loved it.
Schofield: Did you have any sense that being the president’s daughter affected your
relations with other students or your relations with faculty members?
Plunkett: [00:42:02] You know, that’s a hard one to assess. I think certainly not the
faculty, because my brother and sister had broken the ice on that one. With
other Stanford students, I don’t know. I bet I was a little bit of a curiosity. I
heard the term “Wally’s dolly.”
Schofield: Oh, interesting. I don’t remember that.
Plunkett: [00:42:32] I think it would be normal for students to be curious, right?
Schofield: Yes.
Plunkett: [00:42:38] But I don’t recall anything awkward or uncomfortable at all. I
think what was embarrassing mainly was the president’s dog, Heidi of
Hoover House, who was a beautiful golden retriever. She would walk with
Dad to the office. She knew all the Fraternity Row cooks who would give
scraps to the president’s dog. She would jump into Cubberley Fountain.
She’d chase dirt clods.

31

I remember a Psych 60 class at a dreadful time of day, after lunch when
you’re sleeping, nodding off. Heidi found me and followed me into class. So
embarrassing.
Schofield: Your dad let her just wander around campus after he went in to work?
Plunkett: [00:43:33] Absolutely. She was Con Home Queen one year. [laughter] Heidi
was just a great dog. One day she found me, picked me up, and followed me
into class in Cubberley. I decided, okay, I’m going to sit in the middle of the
row so the dog can’t track me. She laid down right in the aisle next to me and
proceeded to fall asleep and snore—which was exactly how everyone else felt
about the class.
Schofield: That’s a great story.
Plunkett: [00:44:12] Losing Heidi was something I tried to do at all times.
Schofield: Then, ultimately, Heidi must have passed on.
Plunkett: [00:44:22] She did. She did. She got arthritic. When I was doing my
graduate work, I did live at home.
Schofield: Did you go straight into an M.A. program after you graduated in 1966?
Plunkett: [00:44:31] Yes. Heidi was, I don’t know, eight or nine years old at that point,
arthritic, and Dad was getting arthritic too. I remember, sadly, she would be
out in the rain and she’d come to the front door of Hoover House, and you
could hear her whimpering. She just couldn’t quite move. So Dr. Sterling,
the arthritic man, would go and he would pick up the arthritic dog to bring
her in.
Schofield: And goldens can be pretty big.

32

Plunkett: [00:45:10] You bet. And that’s a tender side of Dad that you wouldn’t always
know about.
Schofield: Very sweet.
Plunkett: [00:45:19] And finally they had to put her down. But, yes, she was a great
family dog.
Schofield: You mentioned that while you were a Stanford student, you got a little more
involved with issues that your dad was dealing with.
Plunkett: [00:45:37] Absolutely. This is 1962 to 1966. This is Mario Savio at Berkeley.
This is daughter of the president dating Frank Morse, who became a cause
célèbre with student rights.
Schofield: Remind me. I don’t remember why Frank was a cause célèbre.
Plunkett: [00:45:57] He came back from Stanford in Italy, a scholarship student.
Schofield: Was he in your same Italy group?
Plunkett: [00:46:05] Yes. Scholarship student, and reported at Admissions for spring
quarter and received a notice, “Please go see the dean.” He went in to see
Dean Winbigler and was told he was suspended. The reason for this was
that at the end of our time in Italy, some of the guys, including Frank, were
extremely exuberant and, I gather, punched out a few door panels and caused
some damage. They believed it had been handled by a council meeting and, I
don’t know, they were supposed to serve hours or something. So it seemed
to Frank overly severe that he was not only suspended, but his scholarship
was yanked. This is the time of student rights, student rights against the
administration, and he therefore became a cause célèbre. There was a song
called the “Frank Morse Singing Blues” that was written and sung in the
33

Spring Sing that year. And it’s Vietnam. Students go to Mississippi with Dave
Harris to register voters.
Schofield: You went?
Plunkett: [00:47:39] Almost. But it’s that time.
Schofield: Things are getting difficult.
Plunkett: [00:47:47] Dad’s office is burned. You know, it’s that time. So you bet I had
conversations with my father. One, I’m dating this guy that’s in the Stanford
Daily all the time, a little awkward. Student issues are kicking in. The faculty
is responding. The president as head of the administration has to respond to
the faculty. So we had a lot of conversations about that at that time.
Schofield: Was it mostly him trying to advise or constrain you, or was it him sharing his
views and you maybe expressing some sympathy with student views?
Plunkett: [00:48:35] It was discussion, and I remember in particular what a frustrating
time it was for Dad working with the faculty [in the Academic Council]. I
hope I’m presenting his viewpoint accurately. My memory is that he was
feeling that the faculty had a job, which is teach the students. Getting overly
involved in political affairs was maybe not their role. So there was clearly a
difference of opinion, and it was contentious.
Schofield: Absolutely, those were difficult times.
Plunkett: [00:49:26] You bet.
Schofield: This is the time at which he retires?
Plunkett: [00:49:29] No. He retires after that, not during. He is the one who is forging
the relationships and the administrative position, I’m going to call it, that
Dick Lyman is given credit for. I’m sorry that Dad is not given the credit he
34

deserves, because he was really on the firing line, and Dick, of course, was
provost at that point. So Dad’s team, that included Dick, was developing the
position that the administration needed to take, reflective of the board of
trustees, in light of what the faculty and the faculty governing body were
doing.
Schofield: Then, of course, when he retires, there’s that very short Pitzer period, which
was pretty unsuccessful.
Plunkett: [00:50:33] I don’t envy any person having to come in after Dad.
Schofield: Yes, he was a very strong figure.
Plunkett: [00:50:42] You bet. And he’d been there such a long time.
Schofield: Twenty-some years?
Plunkett: [00:50:47] Twenty-three, I think.
Schofield: Dick Lyman was the continuity from Wally through Pitzer and then he had
to forge ahead.
Plunkett: [00:50:57] Right, exactly.
Schofield: The person we haven’t talked about is Fred Terman, the Fred and Wally duo.
Plunkett: [00:51:08] You bet.
Schofield: It was a heck of an academic duo.
Plunkett: [00:51:11] Oh, it was fabulous.
Schofield: What are your recollections? Were there family connections, or were these
all work connections?
Plunkett: [00:51:16] More work connections. I think Dad was just remarkably grateful
for not only Fred Terman, but if I may add Fred Glover and—oh, my gosh,
tall, handsome, blond—Brandin.
35

Schofield: Alf Brandin.
Plunkett: [00:51:36] Yes. It was Alf Brandin who pretty much, if memory serves, came
up with the whole idea of developing the land and the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Schofield: That’s correct.
Plunkett: [00:51:50] This was a phenomenal team of creative thinkers and leaders. On
the academic side, certainly, Dr. Terman gets credit there. And the whole
development of how do we bring in revenue. A lot of that was Alf Brandin.
It was just a remarkable group of men. So as I grew up, if I didn’t have
actual discussion about it, I certainly knew. I sensed with Dad that he was
extremely grateful for this group of people with whom he was able to work.
I actually don’t have major memories of Dr. Terman. I can visualize him. I
know Dad respected him enormously, but I don’t think I can go a lot further
than that in my memory.
Schofield: I’ve heard it said that they had a very effective, almost good cop-bad cop
relationship because Terman could be gruff and harsh and say no when he
had to, and your dad was gracious and funny and warm. So between the two
of them they could always make things work.
Plunkett: [00:53:13] Yes, I can see that. Dad’s nature was conciliatory. I think he’d
rather resolve—he knew how to be decisive, but he also, I know, believed
that consensus is often a great way to operate. He had a well-packed bag of
administrative tools. He knew.
Schofield: And he’d learned them along the way, because, as you mentioned earlier, he
wasn’t a seasoned administrator when he began at Stanford.
36

Plunkett: [00:53:46] Well, it’s funny. If you look at all the things he did in his growing
up, he was often a pinch-hitter for his dad. He delivered sermons. He
learned how to play the organ to support his dad in church. Working on his
master’s degree, he coached semi-pro football in Alberta, Canada. He was an
athlete. He played tennis and basketball and football. He did a lot of
different things.
You know, it’s funny, with our recent Rose Bowl moment, as I was
listening to Coach Shaw make his remarks, I was thinking about the PAC 8
and Dad’s involvement with it. For him, it was all about the student athlete.
He would have been so proud of those kids, [football players] how they
spoke and how they presented themselves, and the coach. There’s no
bombast. It was just style. And it was lovely.
Schofield: You mentioned earlier, before the interview, that while your dad was a
professor at Caltech, he had an interesting side job.
Plunkett: [00:55:10] Yes. Let me speak to that. He found an opportunity to
supplement his salary at Caltech by broadcasting the news for CBS. He
would drive from Pasadena to nearby Burbank to do his broadcasts, and he
became quite good. The story I think you want me to tell is about his station
manager one day asking him if he would meet a fellow Canadian because this
young man was interested in news broadcasting. Dad said, “Certainly,” and
after the interview he told the station manager he didn’t think Chet Huntley
would really do that well in the business. Another great apocryphal family
story.
Schofield: Did he enjoy the broadcasting, do you think?
37

Plunkett: [00:56:02] You know, I think he did. I really think he did. My father’s sister
was a great Shakespearian actress, well known in Canada.
Schofield: What was her name?
Plunkett: [00:56:16] Elizabeth Sterling, called Beth. I think there was a bit of the
thespian in Dad. He sang Gilbert and Sullivan in college. I just think he had,
if not a flair for drama, kind of an instinct for it. I think you know this from
talking to other students who were at Stanford when he was president, he
was a gifted speaker. He was a gifted narrator, a great storyteller. He had a
sense of theater.
Schofield: Interesting. He had a—
Plunkett: [00:57:07] A marvelous voice.
Schofield: —a booming voice and a presence.
Plunkett: [00:57:10] And a presence, exactly. I don’t know if that was just absolutely
natural, but it was there.
Schofield: That certainly had to carry him well. Those background experiences would
help him become an important university president, building the university
“from good to great.”
Plunkett: [00:57:32] Absolutely. You hear the phrase “comfortable in your own skin.”
Well, he absolutely was. He was a very authentic person in so many ways.
Schofield: Do you happen to know what he was most proud of as Stanford president?
Plunkett: [00:57:49] Oh, what a good question. No, I don’t.
Schofield: Did he ever express regrets?

38

Plunkett: [00:57:55] Not that jump out at me. This is perhaps an odd postscript. It
always fascinated me that I never heard him speak unkindly of Stanford
students. Even when his office was torched, which was …
Schofield: I wrote it down. July 1969.
Plunkett: [00:58:28] I just never heard him utter an unkind word. He just never spoke
ill of the kids. And in that fire he lost, I can’t tell you how much, that was
about him.
Schofield: His personal records and memorabilia.
Plunkett: [00:58:58] Oh, you bet. Absolutely. Absolutely.
Schofield: You’d have to be bitter, I would think.
Plunkett: [00:59:05] But I never heard it expressed.
I’ll tell you a high mark. He was a humble man. But I know a high mark for
him were his two knighthoods from the queen.
Schofield: Knighthoods?
Plunkett: [00:59:25] Yes. You’ll have to look up the dates on this, but I’m going to
guess late fifties, early sixties. He became involved with something called the
Ditchley Foundation, based in England, which was a collaborative effort with
higher education between the United States and the U.K. He was very much
involved with that. He was knighted first with an OBE, Order of the British
Empire, and then again, but I’m not sure if it was still for Ditchley or not,
with the CBE, which is Commander of the British Empire.
Had he and Mom lived in London, he would have been known as Sir Wallace
and she would have been Lady Sterling. He’d never say this out loud, but I

39

think he felt pleased that this endeavor was received so well—but he was a
very humble man.
Schofield: When he retired, he became the first and only chancellor of the university.
Do you have any recollection of his role or his work as chancellor, or was
that more honorific?
Plunkett: [01:01:05] I think it was more honorific, though certainly he would have
done whatever the sitting president would have asked of him. He had an
office in the Meyer Library. He was a great one for personal
correspondence. He wrote notes to people, so I’m sure he did a lot of
correspondence. I know he spent maybe two years on putting together
recollections for his three children. He never wanted them to be called
memoirs. They are for us only, which we have, but they are never to be
officially published.
Schofield: And never shared?
Plunkett: [01:01:59] Correct.
Schofield: You know that the Stanford Archives would love to have those. [Laughs]
Plunkett: [01:02:08] Of course they would. But they were written just for us.
Schofield: Interesting.
Plunkett: [01:02:20] Yes, it’s really quite something.
Schofield: Do you revisit them from time to time?
Plunkett: [01:02:24] Yes, I do. I revisited them because I wanted his voice telling me
about the period of time he was here [at the Huntington], but it’s very brief.
It didn’t give me as much as I wanted.
Schofield: And then you came to work at the Huntington.
40

Plunkett: [01:02:40] Exactly.
Schofield: What a lovely thing that he was here as director for a short period and then
you later become involved and are now full-time employed here. It’s like
closing a circle.
Plunkett: [01:02:54] Dad was asked by President Lyndon Johnson to chair the
Bicentennial Commission for the country, leading up to 1976. One thing I do
remember, and I thought, “Wow, this is my dad,” he went back to
Washington several times, sort of to learn the scope of the task, and he
resigned as head of the Commission.
Schofield: He took the position?
Plunkett: [01:03:34] I think I’m correct in saying that he took it. But a little bit into it,
he resigned. And I thought, “This is so interesting.” The reason he gave me
was that it was so staff-driven, it was so bureaucratic, it was not efficient. He
wasn’t comfortable using taxpayer dollars in that way. It was really just so
typically Dad. He was, “I’m just not okay with this. I don’t need the honor.”
It’s not about the honor. It would be about doing a good job. And he just
did not feel, given the construct, that it was something that he wanted to
continue with.
Schofield: I don’t know if that’s well known.
Plunkett: [01:04:41] Oh, one more thing. There was at the time a fabulous staff in Los
Angeles running the Stanford office down here. And living in Pasadena, I
hooked up with Dad a lot if he was down here on Stanford business.
Schofield: Did you move here directly after your master’s?

41

Plunkett: [01:05:02] No, after I was married to Frank and he finished Harvard Law
School. This one time, Dad and I went down to Casa Pacifica, which was the
residence of Richard Nixon following his presidency, and Mr. Nixon was
looking for a place to have the Nixon Library. So I had the great fun of the
car ride down with Dad. After we pulled in I just stayed in the car, and he
went in and had his visit with Mr. Nixon. Dad came right back out again,
and off we went back to L.A.
And I said, “So?”
And he said, “So?”
And I said, “So? It was a private conversation.”
Schofield: I see. So you weren’t going to hear what had been said.
Plunkett: [01:06:04] No. That’s Dad. That was a private conversation, and he’s not
going to tell his daughter.
Schofield: Interesting. So the assumption would be that Nixon might have been
considering Stanford?
Plunkett: [01:06:20] Oh, absolutely.
Schofield: Just as Reagan later considered Stanford. I’ll be darned. What an interesting
life growing up.
Plunkett: [01:06:37] Oh, my goodness, yes—and it was about exposure. So much of
what I’ve carried into adult life—Mom and Dad could have raised us so
differently. It was ridiculous. We grow up in this preposterous house, right?
They would not ever let it go to our heads, ever, ever. Somehow they were
able to create this sense of home, even with their very busy lives. Mom
worked just as hard as he did. Yet somehow it was family.
42

Schofield: That’s a great credit to them.
Plunkett: [01:07:30] Absolutely, absolutely, it was. You know, they were really cool
about our bringing Stanford chums home to the house for supper, just like
normal people. They were very good at what they did, and I’m saying “they”
quite deliberately, because I don’t think Mom gets enough credit.
Schofield: Well, if she were only living, I would be interviewing her as the president’s
spouse—talking about her view of running that house and welcoming guests
and raising her children.
Plunkett: [01:08:07] You bet. One thing to add about Mom. After Daddy died, I
needed to make sure of some things—and who did I go see? I think I went
to visit Don Kennedy. I think he was president.
Schofield: When did your dad die?
Plunkett: [01:08:25] 1985.
Schofield: Okay. That would be Don.
Plunkett: [01:08:29] I made an appointment with him. I said, “I just need to be sure
that the university understands how it is that the house in Woodside came to
the university and is presently the chancellor’s home.” It was Mom’s
friendship with Mrs. Cleveland Forbes that led to Mrs. Forbes bequeathing
the house and its three acres to the university with the proviso that Dr. and
Mrs. Sterling could live in it, if they wished, for their lives. I wasn’t quite sure
if Stanford knew that, and I did not want a situation where they thought,
okay, now that Wally’s gone, we don’t have any obligations.
Don was very gracious, and said no, he hadn’t quite known all of
that. I also wanted to make sure that the university was taking care of her
43

health insurance. There were some things I wasn’t sure of, and Mom would
not have wanted to put those questions forward herself.
Schofield: Did she continue to live there until she passed away?
Plunkett: [01:10:01] Yes, she did, exactly, at which point the house reverted wholly to
Stanford and Stanford sold it.
Schofield: That was a good daughterly thing to make sure of, absolutely.
Plunkett: [01:10:15] Well, thank you. But you never know, and I don’t believe in
assumptions. It would have been an expense for Stanford, certainly, but I just
wanted to make sure. So I did.
Schofield: Good for you. Well, I think we’ve talked for a bit over an hour. It’s been
lovely.. You have a far better memory than I had any reason to expect. These
have been really great recollections, Judy.
Plunkett: [01:10:52] Good. Thank you.
Schofield: I really appreciate it.
Plunkett: [01:10:54] Thank you. It’s very sweet of you to make the time.
Schofield: No, I have been very pleased to do it. And if you remember anything, “Oh,
gosh, I should have told you,” you can just let me know.
