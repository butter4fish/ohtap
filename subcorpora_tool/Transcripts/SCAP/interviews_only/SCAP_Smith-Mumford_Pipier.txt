DANA: 			So, I’m Illaria Dana interviewing Piper Smith-Mumford–

SMITH-MUMFORD:		Yeah

DANA:	–for the Alumnae Oral History Project at Smith College. I want to start just with a general question of how did you decide to come to Smith.

SMITH-MUMFORD:	So, I’m thinking about — it was not as deliberate as maybe some other stories might be. I had three colleges that my family thought would be very (laughs) good for me to apply to, and I wanted to be near where many of my friends were going, and it turned out that I got into all three colleges, and most of my friends went UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amherst]. So I thought, Smith College, hey, that sounds good. So, I did not step foot on campus until I came prior to September in the Bridge Program I just participated in, and I was floored, overwhelmed, and couldn’t believe my good fortune to have arrived at such a beautiful campus where already there was efforts being made to help me succeed by participating in this program prior to the rest of the student body arriving. So I feel a little bit like divine intervention. My family knew this was a great place, I heard about it, but I didn’t do the kind of research I insist students do as a former guidance counselor. So that’s why it feels different.

DANA:		What was Bridge like for you when you came?

SMITH-MUMFORD:	It was an incredible experience. It was an opportunity to connect with other students who look like me, had similar experiences, or maybe very different experiences, but it gave me a chance to be on the campus and to be a part of a smaller group of students before the rest of the student body arrived, and we stayed in Gillett House, and we went on field trips and we had an opportunity to go to the other colleges, and I rode the five college bus, and it was a great grounding for what would be an incredible four years at Smith. It was the kind of connection you hope to make so that when you have those difficult moments, you know where to go, you know where you will get support, and Smith did that right off the bat.

DANA:	What other places did you get support while you were here? Who was helpful to you?

SMITH-MUMFORD:	I would say that that group of students my freshman — we bonded and supported each other in ways where — often as a student of color, you don’t know if people fully understand what you might be challenged by or what your struggles are, and, so, when you have someone who’s had a similar experience, you don’t have to maybe give all the background. You can just say, “Oh, my God. I can’t believe what happened to me. Wait until I tell you this.”  And you go right to it, and you don’t have to do a lot of prefix, like, They’re nice people. They mean well.
You just talk about what it is you’re struggling with, and having that cohort of students who — some I’ve maintained friendships with. We don’t see each other, but we now text. We didn’t have that technology then. We wrote long letters, but it was that common experience of supporting each other during difficult times, and I’d have to say that my professor, Fran Volkmann — I was a psych major — I felt very connected to her. She was my advisor — my academic advisor — and she made me really feel like there wasn’t anything she hadn’t heard already, so whatever you’re struggling with academically or personally, socially, her door was always open, and it wasn’t that that was a first experience for me, but it was certainly the first time being away from home, and certainly I — very close to my family, could pick up the phone, or even hop on the Peter Pan bus and go home if I had to back to Boston, but it was having someone right on campus between those close friends and this academic advisor who was really supportive in many, many ways and really was a model for me about what a college professor does. I just thought they teach. They do more than that, and at a school like Smith, you really — I really found that to be sort of what I expected from everyone. That’s what you’re supposed to do — teach well, know your subject matter, but care more than just about the subject when you have students in front of you.

DANA:	Mm-hmm. What about the social life here? What house did you live in?

SMITH-MUMFORD:	So, I lived in Cutter three years — three and a half years — and my last semester they opened up the Friedman House, and there was a big lottery for this fancy new townhouse — different than the other houses, as Cutter and Ziskind are, but like the most independent living on-campus like an apartment, and we won the lottery, my three friends and I, and it was sort of the capstone of my experience at Smith to be able to be a part of this new housing experience that — it’s almost like I know I wasn’t there the whole time, but that last semester was a special semester, and to be in this brand new complex just was the icing on the cake — the cherry on top, if you will — and it came at the right time because having those first three years in Cutter was important with all the other students, but having this — I do believe that it’s important to be a part of the house system and that that experience is a little bit different. You’re so much more independent. You’re cooking. You’re not in the kitchen. You’re not going down to the dinners, but the full Smith experience provided that, both those first three years and that last year, so, it broadened my perspective about what it meant to be in college and independent — choosing your food, working together, and cooking together. So that was different and I always felt Cutter different than the quad and all the other houses. I chose it. Some of it I think initially was because that was what I envisioned about what college was and, again, because I hadn’t researched Smith, I knew less about the house system, and when I saw [it?], I was like, Oh, okay, I see why there’s such a popular to be in the quad or be in one of the more traditional houses, but I felt really good about my choice at Cutter in the suite that I had with the roommates that I had. So it worked for me, whereas some — I remember students saying, “You’re in Cutter? Oh, that’s that odd — that’s not like the others.” I said, “You’re right, and some of us are not like the others,” (laughter) so it worked for me. Yeah.

DANA:	Do you remember any Smith traditions that feel like stuck out to you or–

SMITH-MUMFORD:	Well, I always remember Mountain Day because it’s always exciting to have that moment when, Oh, free time, (interviewer laughs) free day! What I also remember is using it to catch up on reading, I mean, doing some work. The whole idea of go out and climb a mountain or go hiking sounds great, but that wasn’t really my experience (laughs) and most times, most of those four years, I remember just it was a time to hang out with friends. We’d do some work, some reading, but then you’d go and find each other and figure out, Well, what are you doing today, and it was just a nice tradition. We didn’t know when it was coming and when you heard the bells — I was talking with some alum today and they were like, Yeah, but then after you decided you weren’t going to get up, the bells kept ringing, (laughter), I don’t remember that because I wasn’t over there were the bells were. I just remember I heard them. You know, the different experiences even about that tradition, I’m reminded that not everyone had the same obvious memories or reflections about what Mountain Day meant.

DANA:		Mm-hmm.

SMITH-MUMFORD:		Yeah.

DANA:		Do you remember anything about activism on campus (unclear)?

SMITH-MUMFORD:	Yeah. So, I was reminded from a workshop I just left that next year will be the fiftieth year for the Black Student Alliance and I had no idea that it had only been ten years in its existence when I arrived. It’s like so many things, when you’re in the moment of it, you just think it’s always been there, and it was another area like the cohort of students that really made this a positive experience for me. I remember throwing parties, you know, being a part of the organizing and sending out fliers to all of the other colleges to come because the black students of Smith College are going to have a party and, you know, you don’t want to miss it, and just the idea that Smith had a cache, like the fellows wanted to come to Smith and check out the Smith women, and when we would go to Amherst — UMass Amherst or Amherst College — or Hampshire [College] or Mount Holyoke [College], I felt like we were known. I felt like, Oh, the Smith women, in a positive way. It was not negative, and so, for me, I always felt that there was this pride and this real attachment to Smith that made you feel like — it grew the confidence in multiple ways.
So certainly over your achievement as a student, but over time as you grew as an individual that it was something about being a Smithie that, in the moment, I don’t think I was in touch with, but in reflection, it’s part of what makes me so happy to be back and part of what I want to cultivate the next generation. I want to help bring more students of color in particular, but any student. As a former guidance counselor, if I could talk a student into coming to Smith, it was like keeping a tally — like, You’re going to thank me later if you don’t know now, but it — you want more people to have the kind of experience that you’ve had when you know how much it’s impacted your life and made you grow in ways that you could never have predicted, and I think the activism at that time had more to do with discovering who you are and not being afraid to respond in ways that when it — something didn’t feel right, you might not have been able to name it, but you could try to keep unpacking it and exploring, like, I’m not sure why this comment you made is not sitting well with me, but I feel like I need to say that and I need maybe some time to think about it more.
That took tremendous (laughs) risk on my part because I was such a shy and quiet and just wanted to be a good student and not sure about what — socializing on my own because I was very much sheltered, but I think my mom, in particular, and my oldest sister, who was 13 years older than me, thought, Yeah, you’ll be fine at Smith. I think they thought I was going to just go along and be along, but I found another side of who I was. I say now that I’m an extroverted introvert because of Smith, that I could be a principal for 19 years because I knew I could do it with support. You can’t — and the support is because of that experience that very first year that tells you, “You may not be sure of some things, but there’s always someone that will help you, and it may not be the first person you talk to or the second, but keep searching because there is support for you,” and this institution, this community, really made me believe in community and a community support.
So, today I teach, at Boston University, family and community engagement course to graduate students in the school of education and I feel like that’s how I can still contribute. I supervise practicum students who want to be principals, and I feel like I did my part, I’m so happy I did it, but I want to be able to say, “We need young folks to want to do that very, very difficult and hard job in a much more complex community world than when I first entered, and the world of technology has so complicated our ability to be in touch with students and families. How do we use that tool in a way that doesn’t get in a way?” Some of my additional education, having a master’s from Harvard and a doctorate from Boston College, is all because of how confident I felt about being a student at Smith. I know that, and I don’t know that I’ve ever been able to express that.

DANA:		Do you need a moment or do — yeah.

SMITH-MUMFORD:	[All?] about the oral history project, I was like, Here’s another way you can contribute, hopefully inspire, give encouragement, and still not be aware of how much it was going to touch me to [want?] do that. It was my first reunion in 39 years. (laughs) I’ve been back. I’ve brought students back. I’ve done a lot of informal visiting, and I, as I was saying, I wasn’t sure why I never really participated in reunion, and I think some of it is because I was working so hard that I thought, Oh, can I take out a weekend? (laughs) I think I needed to do whatever I needed to do to get to this point.
You know, things happen for a reason, but to hear that tomorrow’s Ivy Day speaker is going to be a student who I knew when she was five years old, she was in my school for nine years, from K to eight, absolutely what I would think of when I think of a Smith student, just inquisitive and — well, since she was five. I mean, just I knew she was headed for really great things — totally caught me off guard. I’m sitting listening to inclusiveness and diversity at Smith and they talk about this student who has two moms and how proud she was knowing she was — so the community embraced all measures of the kinds of families we have, and she was outspoken as a seven, eight, nine, ten (laughs) year old, that to hear as a twenty-one — twenty-two — year old that she has continued to develop that side of herself to share — I have no idea what her message is, but I can only imagine, and already with such great pride, to hear that she, from my alma mater, that she’s going to speak in a very important day — another affirmation of the incredible experience that Smith provides. It just — I was emotional. I got goosebumps sitting there thinking, There can only be one Katie Hitchcock Smith. I know this is the same student, and, wow. Like I followed her through high school, I knew she was — and then you kind of lose touch. I think somebody told me she went to Smith, and that was the last that I heard, and to be at this particular reunion and commencement and to — I just — like things happen for a reason.
I believe that the path you take is the path you’re meant to take and the journey is the journey and sometimes you wonder why and you question and you’re not always sure if you’re making the right decision, but in the end I just have this sense of faith that it’s what’s — it is what it’s supposed to be, and I find myself here wanting to share this story, wanting to share my story, as I said, as another way to contribute to future Smithies, and as I think about what I would want from — for my own daughter, if I had one, would be to have this experience, and I don’t think — I used to hear parents say to me, “I want my child to go to your school because what I see happening here is the kind of experience I want my children to have. I want my children to have those teachers that you have hired. I want to go back to school and be a part of this community. I want to contribute in a way that adds to the specialness of what this community feels like to me,” and, for me, teaching family and community engagement is all about the connections and the relationship building and that, again, is where it began right here at Smith — that that is what sustains.
It certainly sustained me and has certainly made me feel like that’s — no matter where you are. I used to be part of my end of year speech or graduation speech that students may not remember what you taught them, but they remember how you made them feel, and that is a key element to the reason students come back, whether it’s to their college experience or their elementary school or their high school and they look for those people who somehow gave them what they needed in that moment in time, and Smith did that for me. It was that for me — that place that I needed in that moment in time even when I (laughs) didn’t even know it, and that I feel fortunate to sit here to be able to reflect back on that to say, “Wow, what a special place. How incredible to have that in my memory and to continue to create new memories connected to Smith, whether I’m here or I’m hearing about students that I know doing great things as Smith students.”

DANA:	Mm-hmm. Do you want to tell us just a little bit about what you’ve done since you left Smith?

SMITH-MUMFORD:	Yes. So, my training — I went on to get a master’s in education from Harvard University’s School of Education, and then I had my first job as a guidance counselor — actually, as a counselor for the METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity] program at Wayland High School, and that was for inner city students going to suburban communities around Boston, and Wayland was 99.9 percent white and the only students of color they had were the students who were bussed in from Boston, and I was their advisor, and I did that for three years, and what it made me feel like, Wow, what an incredible job. I’m maybe three or four older than the (laughs) high school students I was supervising, and I needed a broader perspective. I could not be the black expert.
Anything that happened for any student, whether they were my students or the one or two who lived in the town, I was called on to help mediate. I was young; I knew that was important work, but I wanted a broader perspective, so I found my niche, if you will, or my community in Brookline Mass, where I landed a job as a guidance counselor at Brookline High and for 12 years I helped to guide lots of student from lots of different backgrounds — many international students, many students of color, many students from wealthy families, many students from families who lived in public housing, and that was so rewarding, and it was never a dull moment. (laughter) It was always something to do and there was always someone who was looking for you, either to help them decide about some really exciting colleges or help them to decide about what they would do with their bodies because they were in a tough position and they didn’t know which way to go, and often helping their families, their parents, see them through those tough times. 	Feeling connected to those students and those families, again, for me, what made all the difference in the kind of really heavy lifting that is. I mean, when I was here at Smith, I said I wanted to be a family therapist. I remember it vividly, like, What do you want to do when you leave, and as a psych major and a minor in education, I thought, Yeah, that sounds right. When I was in seventh grade, someone said, “What do you want to do?” I said, “I want to be a psychiatrist.” So I know along the way I knew working with people in behavior — studying human behavior was really interesting and important. I didn’t know how it would really play out. Being in schools was the answer for me because it gave some structure and it was important to help students meet those academic goals while also paying attention to who they are as individuals because we weren’t making widgets, I said. When we’d come up with all these policies and everybody has to follow this, I said, “Yeah, and we know that some students won’t be able to. We need to make a plan for those who struggle in those areas.”
It always felt important to cast as wide a net in whatever we were trying to do and not narrow it, and, again, lending my voice to administration because that was never my goal, and having people say to me, “You should go for this principalship.” I was like, No, I’m behind the scenes person. I am up not out front. They said, Oh, yeah, you need to because people listen to you [da dis?], and I said, “Okay, I’m hearing you say that.” An opportunity came to be principal of a freshman campus, Brookline High, under construction for two years, all the ninth graders in a separate building. Do this for two years. Be the principal of that ninth grade campus. Oh, for two years? Sure, I can do anything for two years. That opened my eyes to the importance of having faculty because we had the most fabu— it’s a legend now. People never remember any of the bad things that happened because we had many mistakes there. It’s this like aura about freshman campus. Like, oh, they’re talking about it again because the school is overgrown. 	They need to figure out where to place one quarter of the class. We should have freshman campus again. Piper, let’s get her out of retirement. I said, “Oh, you guys are funny. (laughter) No, that’s not going to happen, but thank you for thinking of me, and then from there the K to eight position opened a Pierce School in Brookline, and was like, I don’t know elementary. That’s not been my experience. So I was little like — and then I thought, But what better way to expand and start early because one of the downsides of being at the high school is they already come in feeling they can’t do certain things or they think they know themselves as a learner and oftentimes it’s not always positive. So get them younger and help to cultivate this idea that I can, not I can’t, and so that’s what really motivated me to say, “You can learn elementary. You don’t have to know the curriculum from K to eight. You just have to know what the teaching looks like,” and I felt that I did know that, and seventeen years later, I — it worked out. I have folks really feeling good about the experience for the most part, and I feel good about what I did, and it was time to retire. Like you kind of know when it’s time.
My school was 550 in 1999. In 2016, there were 890 students. It was a very different school. I had to think about things I never had to think about, like traffic patterns, students trying to get to gym from their classroom. You can’t have the whole class that’s going the same way. It takes forever. I mean, those — the nuances of what it means to run a school, hire people, think creatively — I never wanted to be the principal who found the lightbulbs because the teacher’s — the lightbulb over her desk — by the end, I was so happy to give the teacher the lightbulb because that was simple. The real complicated things were how do you be a great instructional leader, how do help the teacher figure out how to teach all the children and not ninety percent of them, that’s hard, and how do you get the teacher not to say, “Oh, that’s the special ed teacher’s responsibility.” “No, no, no, no, no. That’s all of our responsibility, and as the primary teacher of all of these children, you foremost.”
Sometimes some people came willingly and asked for help and other times they were like, Oh, I’ve always done it this way. Yeah, but this is a new day. You know, so, I had to cultivate those skills to help people find that maybe it’s time to move on. Hard because you want everyone to leave with dignity and their head held high. No one is all bad. I had so many fights with people who said, “Oh, get rid of them.” I said, “You say that now, but ten years ago people were singing this teacher’s praises, and our personal lives change, which means we always bring who we are to everything we do. We have to give this teacher a chance to change or to recognize this is not the same job and to counsel them out in a way that makes them leave feeling good about what they have been able to do.” You can only do that for so many years before you start to feel — before I started to feel ineffective or overwhelmed or the school is so big now, it — and things happen, again, for a reason, and I reached my eighty percent, and it was time to move on to something else and Boston University fell in my lap, and I thought, Here’s a way to continue to be a part of the educational scene and to help cultivate new leadership, and, so, I’m happy for this past year to have taught this class and to have been in lots of different schools helping graduate students who are in their practicum to be principals to do that — yeah, to pass it on. So that’s one aspect.
So often — we’re all multi-faceted, and so my personal passion is about helping all the voices be heard. So often I didn’t think my voice was heard. Even as a professional for many years, if you’re at an administrative table and you’re three women and ten men, I’d call on my Smith experience every chance I could get, like I know my voice is just as valuable. I know sometimes I have to look to a colleague for them to say, “I think Piper just said that,” even though a male colleague has said the exact same thing two comments later. So cultivating allies and relationships again to help get to where we want to go. I am not tied up in I’ve got to get the credit, but there reaches a point when, wait a minute, I did say the same thing. I don’t know why it wasn’t heard the first two times I said it, and it wasn’t heard until he said it. So those things still happen and as I have matured, I am less personalizing it and more aware of how a culture creates that -- to continue to happen, that instance, and that having more and more people be aware that that’s not what you want, I want to help those administrative cultures that do not recognize and value all the voices or so it appears because I think they would think they do, but your practice versus your — you know, what you say you believe. So how do your beliefs and your practice match up, and so that’s another thing I’m looking at helping districts sort of do some evaluation of their equity issues or equity auditing. Brand new, fresh on the scene, but excited about the potential for what that work means for me and what I can contribute.

DANA:		Well, thank you so much.

GEIS:		That was wonderful.

DANA:		Yeah.

SMITH-MUMFORD:	Thank you. I really — I really appreciate your patience and this opportunity. This was–
