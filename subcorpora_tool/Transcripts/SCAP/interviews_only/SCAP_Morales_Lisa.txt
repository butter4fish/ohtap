KLINGER:	So this is Rachel Klinger and I am conducting an interview with Lisa (indiscernible) Morales on May 17, 2013 for the Smith College Alumnae Oral History Project.  Thanks so much for agreeing to be part of this.
MORALES:	Thank you.
KLINGER:	So why did you a choose to attend reunion this year?
MORALES:	It's my 25th.  I think this is my third reunion.  I think I was here for five, 10.  I think I was in Paris for the 15th and I am here now.
KLINGER:	And how did you come to be at Smith?
MORALES:	It's a round-about story as most Ada Comstock scholars stories are.  My daughter turned three the year that I started at Smith, so she is a September 19, so she turned three after I got here.  And I was at Westfield State College and had been accepted as a senior in high school because I am local, and I was actually at the welfare office and one of the people there said you should go to Smith and I kind of laughed and he said no really.  And I followed through on that and, you know, was shocked and grateful and I came in I was here for three years and graduated.
KLINGER:	What was it like for you when you first arrived?
MORALES:	Scary.  Very scary, I had to find daycare.  I had to -- I still lived in West Springfield, I had to commute.  I had to find a car to commute.  And this wasn't a world I was familiar with.  No one on either side of my family had ever been to college, ever.  So this was all new, and I just walked around in awe.  My great great grandmother had lived in Northampton forever.  My family is from Amherst originally on another site, but you know we would drive through Amherst and I would say I want to go to Amherst College and my mother said you can't , it's for men only.  You have to go to Smith.  But I don't think she ever thought that I really would.  So I was glad my mother lived to see me graduate from Smith and then from graduate school.
KLINGER:	Yeah.  Did you feel like Smith supported you through those challenges?  It sounds like it was difficult.
MORALES:	Ellie Rothman was the Dean of Ada Comstock Scholars then in so many of us are eternally grateful to Ellie  for some many things.  The financial aid was a different situation than.  We had this what we call Let Them Eat Textbooks campaign because you could either have food stamps or you could have aid from the college but not both.  So our thing was what are we supposed to feed our kids?  Textbooks?  And the college did everything they could to make sure that we could sustain a living while we were -- if in fact -- because not all Adas were on aid.  That is a misconception.  But those of us who were needed to be able to live and come to school, and the federal government counted anything you got from the school as income.  So it was not an easy thing, and it was new, because Smith had not had to deal with that in the past.
KLINGER:	Could you talk a little bit about your involvement in that campaign or in the Ada Comstock community?
MORALES:	We -- well, there was a lot of things going on at the time.  We had the sit in at college hall which '88s will tell you about because of the divestiture.  We had a lot of the college’s endowment in places like Coca-Cola, and that was the whole anti-apartheid movement during that time.  And we wanted the college to divest from those holdings.  And that still is an issue today.  People don't know where the college's money is held and for me, from the social issues point, that's still -- you know, when I give money to the college, I don't want to give it to those people, but we had that.  My mother was appalled that I brought my daughter to the sit in, but you know, I became a labor activist after college and my daughter went to many more strike lines and sit ins thereafter, so it was her last.  But many of us have our children that were part of that.  And I think it was a good lesson.
KLINGER:	Totally.  Could you talk specifically about the -- you said Let Them Eat Textbooks campaign?
MORALES:	The college had a program that if something came up, like my stove broke, they would do what they called the vendor payments.  So they would buy the stove directly -- that you didn't have income directly into your hand.  It was not in any way wrong, but it was what was necessary to allow us to continue.  I mean I left Smith with a lot of loans in my own name.  It wasn't a handout.  And I think I finished paying them off about the time my daughter started college, so -- but I was active at that time and there was also an issue at that time about whetherAda Comstock was going to be a separate class.  We were the only class that increased in numbers every year.  A graduating class is a finite number.  Adas continued to increase every year, and so they wanted us to no longer have our own class to be with your graduating class, and I was part of that task force.  We could no longer have our own column in the Quarterly, it was very political, and since then it's reversed.  So now Adas are a class again and they have their own column in the Quarterly, but now has a reunion organizer people don't quite know where they belong, so I think it's an ongoing issue even today.
KLINGER:	Absolutely.
(Videographer and Interviewer discuss a technical issue, recorded but not transcribed.)
So could you talk a little bit about what like the political climate was like while you were here?  I know you sort of touched on it a little bit but --
MORALES:	Well, the '80s were a transition time.  It was also, you know, the -- not too long after was the Hillary Clinton comment, about you know, going to stay home and bake cookies.  And so Wall Street had collapsed and '86.  Those of us who had big plans to go to Wall Street, that didn't happen.  So there were, you know, trying economic times, but politically things were I think a little calmer here.  Because I was an Ada and lived off campus, I wasn't involved in house politics for all that kind of thing.  Just kind of the bigger picture of what was going on.
KLINGER:	And did you see the student bodies were diversifying during your four years here?
MORALES:	Very little.  Very little.  Very little.  I think the Ada's brought the most diversity because there was an age diversity.  Diversity isn’t only race or color, but there was age diversity and I think that was a healthy thing for the college.
KLINGER:	How did you feel about Jill Ker Conway's presidency as the first female president?
MORALES:	I was with Jill only one year.  But again, Jill founded the Ada Comstock Scholars program and we are all eternally grateful.  She was our commencement speaker and she is speaking with our class specifically tomorrow.  We asked her to come back and speak with us.  So Jill was so impressive to me, just so impressive.  Her grace and her demeanor were so gentle but she really was a leader.  She brought the college into that next era and I wish she could have stayed longer.
KLINGER:	Would you mind talking about some of your favorite like Smith traditions or anything that you remember from those years?
MORALES:	Illumination night.  I can remember bringing my mom, you know, my first year to illumination night and I was just so thrilled to bring her here and you know, listen to the jazz band and I had my daughter with me too.  She must have been three.  She was three and that was really magical for me to be able to start to show my mom this other world that I was part of, and growing up in Amherst in Northampton, she had not ever been able to take part in, so she was always on the edges of it.  But that was one of my favorites.  I never went to Friday tea.  I wish I had, but you know, it just -- I had two jobs, I had a kid, I had -- you know, so it just wasn't part of my life, but I just used to love coming up and just getting here in the morning and walking around in a really beautiful place, and I took so much advantage of walking through the archives or through the library or through the -- looking at the rare book room or -- I spent a lot of time in the plant house in February just smelling the olive trees and the lemon trees and I'd just hang out in there, because it was really special.  So different than the world I was in the rest of the time.
KLINGER:	How did you come to chose your major or area of study?
MORALES:	Because when I went to Westfield State College, I walked in and they had like three classes left that were open that I could take.  And two of them were economics.  That was it.  From there on in, I was an economics major, and then I picked up the international relations minor.  I think I was the only one who ever did economics with just algebra, because I had never had calculus in my life.  I have a GED.  I don't have a high school diploma.  I was married before my class graduated and I started college before my class even finished high school.  So it's different, but that's how I became an economics major, and then I had Bob Bushell's labor economics class which really determined the next 15 years of my life.  I got my master's in labor relations and became a labor negotiator for nurses and teachers and that's what I did for the next 15 years.
KLINGER:	Oh, that just took my next question.
MORALES:	I fought the good fight, mm-hmm.
KLINGER:	Definitely, and why did you choose to attend reunion this year?
MORALES:	Well, because I got put in charge of it for one thing.  One of our vice presidents became a widow just a few months ago and that really took away from her ability to do it, and so people weren't around and I was asked.  I'm a class secretary but I've always been involved with Smith.  I’ve been a club president.  I've been an ACK, I've been a NACK.  I've been in various positions.  Always giving back to the college in that way, but -- so this is just one more step.
KLINGER:	And what difference does your Smith education make for you?
MORALES:	All the difference.  I wouldn't even have had a high school diploma.  What would I have gone on?  So it gave me a lot of confidence.  I did an Outward Bound during my senior year over -- I think it must have been June, so between junior and senior year I did Outward Bound and while I was out there on the little rock for three days by myself, I decided I'd go to graduate school, which was huge.  And my mom said you should really get a job.  She didn't get the whole graduate school thing, but that's when I made that decision to keep going, and then when I was much older, I went back to grad school again for another degree, so we always keep changing and doing things differently.  And my children are age 30 and age 9, so I did that again too.
KLINGER:	Yeah.  Were there any professors or mentors that really inspired you during your time here?
MORALES:	Yeah.  I just -- you know, Bob was a huge -- Bob Bushell was a huge influence, obviously.  Like I said he did -- you know, really helped determine like my career course.  Elizabeth Von Klemperor I just adored.  I had enough credits to minor in English, but I went with the IR.  But I just loved her classes.  I did a lot of work in French.  But yeah, I think Elizabeth and Bob and Randy Bartlett too.  Of course, everybody.
KLINGER:	Were you involved in any other -- I know you had a lot of things going on in your life, but any other extracurriculars or groups that you --
MORALES:	Nope.  I couldn't do it.  No.  Couldn't do it.
KLINGER:	Yeah.  That's.
MORALES:	No, I got involved in that Ada Task Force at the end, but that was really -- I didn't have any time for the club and all that good stuff.
KLINGER:	Yeah, and do you feel like the -- do you feel like the college supported you with your like unique challenges as an Ada with a child?
MORALES:	Sometimes.  I mean they tried.  Like when I wanted to go to junior year abroad in Paris, they didn't get their minds around that at all.  They could not get their minds around me taking my four year old to Paris.  That just wasn't going to happen.  And I really tried to advocate for that, but it didn't happen.  And that might have been a life changer too, because I went back for my Ph.D. in French later, still working on it, but I've taught in France.  I've spent a lot of time in France, and that might have been a life changer, but I didn't get to do it.  I didn't get to go to France until 1991 for the first time, so -- that was -- that was hard.  I felt like they weren't supporting me.  I couldn't live on Bedford Terrace because I had a child who was under six and there was lead paint, which I found out later was not an appropriate thing for them to tell me.  So there were challenges, but I think the college was learning and growing at the same time, so I had a habit of coming up with these challenging ideas that nobody quite knew what to do with, so --
KLINGER:	Could you talk a little bit about your work after Smith and into graduate school forward?
MORALES:	Yeah, I was a substitute teacher for a year.  That was kind of bad.  But then I went to grad school.  I had a fellowship and I had a teaching assistantship, so I worked and taught.  I taught issues of women and work, and I was an editor of the labor report that came out of the labor studies program at UMass.  So I did that program in two years.  I lived in Amherst and immediately out of grad school I moved to Albany to work for the New York State nurses Association and I stayed in Albany for 20 years.  I worked for three unions, SCIU and then New York State United Teachers representing all kinds of school workers in upstate New York and I was a negotiator and did arbitrations for them.  And then I re-married after 17 years as a single mom in 2000, and I was already at Suny Albany in the MA-Ph.D. program in French.  I was doing that while I was still working, and then I just decided to go to school and then I did the teacher exchange program to go to Grenoble and then I taught at the University of Grenoble for a year.  I did a Bryn Mawr program in Avignon.  And then we moved to the Cape, and now I'm a real estate broker, and I own my own company.  So you know, as all Smithies, I learn, I grow, I change and some things are the same, contracts are contracts and negotiating is negotiating whether it's a contract for workers or a house, but it's been an interesting journey.
KLINGER:	Yeah.  Was -- so it seems like -- did your family have -- what was your family's response to you coming to an all women's college?  Was that even a factor?
MORALES:	No, because my family is from here, so they know Smith and they know.  Amherst was for men, Smith is for girls, and I never considered Mount Holyoke, so that was the deal.  I never thought of going anywhere else and so -- and I did a lot of admissions work for Smith after that and when I did college fairs I would say to the boys who tried to take my materials, "I don't care how smart you are, you can't go to Smith."  And they'd be, "Why not?"  "Because it's a women's college," and I would heartbroken if Smith were to go co-ed.
KLINGER:	So do you think there is a value in a single-sex education?
MORALES:	Absolutely, and at this level, yes.  I think for younger kids -- I have a son who is like I said nine.  I think they need that, you know, socialization at that age and be able to work those issues out.  But I know when I taught at UMass and I taught at a coed university and here and in France, the boys shouted down the girls every time.  So you know, I always tell the women that I'm talking to about Smith, who is going to be the head of the student government, a woman.  Who is going to be the head of the radio station, a woman.  Who is going to, you know, be the head of the symphony, a woman.  And you won't have to spend all your money on football team.
KLINGER:	Absolutely.  Besides the divestiture movement which you mentioned, were there any other campus wide conflicts or protests or anything else like that that you remember?
MORALES:	There were some anti-Semitism issues.  And I don't know why at that time it was raising its ugly head, but there were.  We were starting to also diversify the faculty which you didn't mention, but at the time the faculty was also rather looked like one group.  So that was actually Monaz Modaves (phonetic) first year and I really enjoyed that time with Monaz and they were really starting to try to put some effort in diversifying the faculty as well.  So I think that was an important time as well.
KLINGER:	Thanks for mentioning that.  Would you have any advice for current or for future Smithies?
MORALES:	I'm hoping my daughter is a future Smithie.  I think my daughter would make an awesome Ada.  She has an associate’s degree.  She is a video game designer in Seattle, but really the women that I have helped to make their way to Smith is to -- you know, you have to get over that first hurdle of it's a women's college and to really take advantage of the richness of the five college system.  To me that's very important.  It's not an isolated tower on the hill.  But my advice is really more to alumni.  It's through us that it is going to stay what it is and what it can become and not to get complacent about it.  And through organizing reunion, I realized that people are complacent.  They assume that because it was a certain way when they were here many moons ago that it is going to be able to continue along those lines, and when you see houses closing, you see so fewer Adas that are here and you see facilities that are closing, it’s a challenge through the recession and to keep the college as good as it can be and as good as it can get, and that's only going to come through the alumnae.
KLINGER:	Yeah.  Are there any other memories that you want to share of Smith or anything about --
MORALES:	It was -- it was a blur.  It's funny last night we were joking about the dot matrix printers that use to be in Seelye.  And that was the soundtrack of our lives, you know, brrrrrr-brrrrr, brrrrr-brrrrrr.  I didn't own a personal computer until graduate school, so you know, driving up here at 10 at night after you know, having my mother come babysit so that I could finish a paper and I'd be here until 2 in the morning and drive home.  Those kind of things, they weren't fun, but they make you what you are, and those kind of things were hard, but Mountain Day was always -- you know, a nice reprieve.  And I just -- those traditions are -- even though there are some that I didn't get to take part in, I'm still very proud of them and that they're here and I still love to go to Alumnae house and just kind of hang out with interesting people, you know.
KLINGER:	Well, thank you so much for your time.  I really appreciate it.
MORALES:	Thank you.
