CLERK: 	I mispronounced it once and now I’m -- (laughter)

JONES:	You’re fine.

CLERK:	OK.  Ready when you are.

JONES:	OK.

CLERK:	I’m Celeste Clerk, interviewing Ms. Beverly Jones, Class of ’97.  Hello.

JONES:	Hello.

CLERK:	So we’ll start with a general question.

JONES:	Sure.

CLERK:	Where are you from?

JONES:	I grew up in Spokane, Washington, which is on the east side of Washington State.

CLERK:	How did you come to Smith College?

JONES:	You know, I — my parents were very thoughtful about making sure that I went to a liberal arts college, preferably far away from home.  My mom didn’t go to college.  My dad had tried to go to college but had to pay for it by himself and it was the 1950s so he was able to afford, I think, a semester or maybe a year of college.  Then he had to drop out to work and then he came up with the brilliant idea of applying to the Naval Academy.  And so, at that time you had to get the certification in front of your elected officials to send you to the Naval Academy.  But then you could go for free.  And so that was how my dad figured out a way to pay for his education.  And I think he always kind of missed that he didn’t have the chance to really pursue the liberal arts education so there were four of us kids — I was the youngest and my parents were very set on, that college was the path that we ought to take.  It didn’t happen completely consistently in my family.  And then for me, when it came time to do — my high school was very college preparatory, gave us a week off to tour colleges — and my dad took me all around New England looking at colleges.  And my dad was, like, in love with the idea of a women’s college.  And I was, like, “Yeah, you know, women’s college, not women’s college.  It’s kind of all the same to me.  I just want to find the place that fits me the best.”  And as it turns out, those two things came together in Smith.  We spent a longer time here than we did at any other school.  I had a friend who was a year ahead of me, two years ahead of me in school, so she was an actual grown-up and took me to the Haymarket and we had tea and I met with her friends and I was, like, Oh, this.  This I could do.
The prospect of picking up and moving 3000 miles away from your parents was pretty daunting but I was, like, I think I could do it here.  It was also 1992.  Bill Clinton got elected.  And so for kids in high school, girls in high school, during that period of time Hillary Clinton was elected for the first time.  She spoke passionately and at great lengths even then about what Wellesley [College] did for her and how powerful it was to shaping her as a lawyer and a prominent — I don’t know what the word is — sort of a self-directed woman.  So that was also part of it.  I actually skipped school to watch the Clinton inauguration in January of 1993 and I was not a school-skipping type.  So it was really sort of that combination of factors.
My dad just passed, probably a year ago.  He loved this place like you wouldn’t believe just because of the promise that it offered for women.  And I think it was something that having had his own college experience in the 1950s — obviously at that time the naval academy didn’t admit women.  He was a fierce, staunch advocate for my coming to Smith.  He was really happy that I made this decision.

CLERK:	What did you study here?

JONES:	Government.  I majored in government.  I think I minored in economics.  The fact that I can’t actually remember that 100 percent sure means it was really minor.  And then I supplemented with a mix of science classes and anthropology and followed my bliss in other ways.  The Government Department was definitely my home.

CLERK:	What was your relationship with your professors like?

JONES:	It varied by professor.  The two that I remember most were both in the Government Department.  I understand they’re both still here which is awesome.  Alice Hearst was my STRIDE [Smith’s Student Research in Departments] professor.  I think I was the first year of the STRIDE Scholars program.  Do they still do that?  Do they still have that?  Do you know?  Where incoming freshmen work in-depth with a professor on something they’re working on, basically as a research assistant.  To be in high school and sitting at a table picking from different projects that professors are working on, like, Do you want to help them with this project?  She was working on some really interesting things with respect to Native American law and culture.  And so I had, right off the bat, an incredibly close working and mentoring relationship with her.
And then, as I kind of progressed through the Government Department and focused my work on political theory, particularly queer theory, women and gender theory, built a relationship with a professor who was at the time very new to Smith — Gary Lehring.  I understand he’s here still, too.  He’s the person that I wrote my thesis for.  I always felt like with particularly those professors, other professors in the Government Department, my education was a partnership between us.  I’m not sure that I would have characterized it as that when I was in it because I do remember hiding from them sometimes when I had things due and wasn’t really on top of things.
The young lady spoke this morning about her Smith experience, one of the class of  ’17, and talked about how nurturing the professors were, how incredibly demanding but demanding in a way that was more about you being and doing your best than anything else.  And I would say that that nails it.  That was the experience.

CLERK:	Were you part of any clubs or organizations while you were here?

JONES:	Rugby.  I was actually just talking to a friend and we were talking about, You know reunion is great.  You get to hang out with your class.  But if I really was going to spend time with the people that I was closest with when I was here it would be the rugby team.  And then, sort of by extension, some of the other club sports.  Let’s see — I know that I was president of the club sports board at a certain period of time.  That was fun and interesting, not least of which that we had kind of an ongoing struggle with the administration to find enough funding, enough support, any kind of personal trainer access as club sports.  So we had a little network of advocates to make sure that the college was focusing on giving support to the club sports in a way that they never had before.  I don’t know that we were entirely successful but we tried.

CLERK:	What did you and your friends do?

JONES:	That I can talk about on camera?  (laughter) You know, it’s funny because — all kidding aside and post-rugby game activities aside because those I’m not going to be memorialized on camera about, you know we were kind of wholesome.  A big night out would be going, driving to the Whately Diner.  That was our fun.  I was never 21 when I was in college so I was never able to legally drink.  I had friends that would spend a lot of time at Packard’s [Bar] or other places.  I was kind of boring on a social level.  Between rugby and just spending good, quality time with the people in my house, I didn’t really get out much.  (laughs)

CLERK:	What was your house?

JONES:	Excuse me.  (coughs) I was in - This is (unclear).  I was in Chapin [House] for my first two years and then moved to Capen [House].  I actually was recruited by a friend of mine along with a couple of other people.  She was, like, “I’m going to be a house president of Capen next year and I want to fill it with my friends.  You need to come and move to my house.”  Of course, she moved to Friedman [House] the next year after that so we were only there together for a year.  It was an interesting experience.  You know?  There are a lot of people who stayed in the same house all four years.  I’m kind of glad that I moved because I think I had a diversity of experience in that arena.

CLERK:	What were the two house communities like?

JONES:	My freshman and sophomore years in Chapin people were very serious and it was a little bit clique-ish.  There was a lot of drama in the house.  I remember that.  And there were a lot of women who lived in the house who really were incredibly driven.  That’s coming out as though I mean it in a bad way.  But very driven, very focused.  I will say that there’s not — I don’t remember it as being very fun.  Capen was a lot of fun.  It was very laid-back, very playful, very easy-going.  A large number of smokers hanging out, smoking in the basement, which I understand is not allowed any more.  I wasn’t one of them but I wanted to be because they were the cool kids, smoking in the basement.  It had a dance floor and so, if you have a dance floor in your house, you’re going to use it.  It was a lot of fun.

CLERK:	Do you remember what the political climate was like when you were here?

JONES:	Absolutely!  My freshman year was the year that — OK.  This is a kid who grew up super-duper sheltered in eastern Washington State.  That was the year that Mary Maples Dunn erased all the chalking after National Coming Out Day.  So the re-chalking was — have you heard this story before?  OK.
The most beautiful morning on campus, used to be and probably still is, the day after — October 12, the day after National Coming Out Day, because everybody goes out and chalks the most beautiful, amazing, powerful, affirming messages all over campus.  Does that still happen?  Yeah?  I’m getting verklempt talking to you about it, right?  Because to walk around campus the morning of October 12 is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen in my entire life.  People chalking, like, 20-year-old love sonnets all over the ground.  It’s life-affirming and it’s powerful and it’s political and it’s amazing and it’s just great.  And so as a 16-year-old from Spokane, which is a very red area of a very blue state, I had no idea what was happening and I didn’t appreciate it the way I do now.
But before I had a chance to process through it — so there was some big alumnae-something, donor-something-or-other.  Mary Maples Dunn was the president of Smith at the time.  So she had the grounds keeping staff erase all the chalk the next day.  This didn’t go over well, to say the least.  Right?  It was so incredibly tone deaf.  It was denying a lot of the reality of what Smith is and was and certainly was in the mid ’90s.  It was unique in the mid ’90s in a way that I think — look, Smith is still incredibly unique but it was pushing the envelope in a way that — which is part of the reason Mary Maples Dunn thought it was OK.  May she rest in peace.  I know she just died so I feel bad talking ill of her but there you go.  So she made this decision.  And the reaction of this amazing, powerful, take-no-shit student body — sorry, am I allowed to curse on the camera?  Was to go out and, I would say double down on the intensity of the messages but that doesn’t even do it justice.  People went completely nuts and chalked some of the most — some beautiful things.  A lot of angry things.  A lot of — there was a lot of raw power just spilled out all over campus.  And certainly 16-year-old me was, like, What just happened?  (laughs) Some of the stuff that was said was a little violent and angry.  A lot of anger.
The college has grown so much since then.  I think the college has realized that it’s special for more than just the reasons that the Class of 1957 thinks it’s special.  It’s a special utopia, I think particularly for queer women.  And I think that was the last dying gasp of the establishment that was trying to say that it wasn’t so or that it wasn’t something that we could talk about.  You can’t imagine how — one of our signs that we marked with, the Class of ‘97 marched with today was “Ruth Simmons is Always Our President.”  That has as much to do with what she was in contrast to Mary Maples Dunn as it does to Ruth Simmons versus who’s the president of the United States right now.  She was a breath of fresh air in so many ways and she actually understood the sacredness of this place in all of its beautiful complexity, in a way that MMD [Mary Maples Dunn] just didn’t.
So starting from that and then — you know, Ruth came and she was with us through the end of our time here.  So it was in the middle of a lot of change when I was here.

CLERK:	What would you say was the typical Smithie of your time here?

JONES:	I don’t think there was one.  There was a lot of division and a lot of — and, again, I think it’s kind of reflective of your previous question about the political environment.  I think there were still a lot of legacy Smithies in their pearls who came here because Mommy came here and Grandma came here and my aunt came here and this is my trust fund and this is my Mercedes.  And there were a lot of serious, bookish academics.  And then there were the more lefty, liberal, disrupter types.  And I wouldn’t say that they always got along.  Again, hearkening back to the woman’s speech this morning where she was talking about creating an organization built to bridge political divides.  When I was here, the political divides were pretty much at war with each other and there wasn’t a lot of crossing over.  Athletes hung out with athletes.  There were definitely pockets.  So I wouldn’t say there was any kind of typical Smithie.

CLERK:	So you — after Smith College, you’ve gone on to become, to work for the ASPCA [American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals].  Can you talk a little bit about that, please?

JONES:	Sure.  I majored in government.  I interned with Alice.  I studied under Gary and everybody except me knew that I was going to be a lawyer when I grew up.  I remember very clearly one of my first classes with Gary where a lot of the material — because it was a constitutional law class so a lot of the material was just reading Supreme Court cases.  And I was, like, “Bring it on! This is great!” and he was, like, “OK.  So when you go to law school,” because other people were, like, struggling with it and, I don’t understand it and what does this mean and what does that mean.  And I was just like More, I want more of that.  So I graduated from Smith.  I then went to work for the Human Rights Campaign and thought that I was going to do policy work for them and ended up doing more field work than policy work.  But I’d interned there in between my junior and senior years in their policy shop so actually I was interning there in the summer of 1996 which is when DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act] happened.  Sorry, the Defense of Marriage Act, which was a real awakening for how policy happens and how much work had to be done to get the entire country to understand some of the basic truths about human lives that we took for granted here.
I was, like, “OK.  I’m going to be back in D.C.”  And so I worked at HRC [Human Rights Campaign] for a couple of years and realized while I was there — I was like, You know, the lawyers really seem to be able to talk about things in a different way than the run-of-the-mill policy people.  They have different tools at their disposal.  There was an article that Laurence Tribe wrote about the Defense of Marriage Act and its constitutional infirmities which turned out to be true.  And I was like, I want to have those tools.  I want to be able to have those conversations with people about the law and the best way to do that was to go to law school.  So I did.  While I was in law school trying to figure out what I wanted to be and do, never did it cross my mind to do anything other than public service.  I was actually just talking to somebody out front.  It was not uncommon to decide that you wanted to spend your life doing public service.  We all, in my class, decided we wanted to serve others in some way.  Talking to them now, right?  My friends are teachers and social workers, professors of chemistry, founders of nonprofits.  It’s kind of what we do.  It’s kind of who we are.  I didn’t know that investment banking was a thing until I got to law school and I was — look, to this day I still don’t actually know what investment bankers did.  I just know that in law school I met a lot of people who were like, Oh yeah.  I graduated from wherever and then I went to iBanking for a couple of years, made a boatload of money and now I’m here in law school.  And I was, like, “Yeah, Smithies don’t do that.”  I don’t even — I’m sure there were some, right?  But it wasn’t really a common path that people talked about.
So.  Public interest.  Went to law school.  Knowing that I was going to do something in public interest.   And found out while I was in law school that nonprofits actually have general counsels and lawyers to represent them and house counsel.  So I have been really privileged all my life to be working for tax-exempt organizations.  Started out after I clerked for the New Jersey Supreme Court, ended up working for the Vera Institute of Justice which does criminal justice and juvenile justice reform in partnership with government, which was fine.  Did really good work.  Awesome people.  But then had the opportunity and once I had kind of built those skills for a few years, felt like I knew what I was doing.  I was, like, OK.  Now I actually have skills that are useful to others.  Now where can I go and take my skill set and be useful and do something that I’m really passionate about?
About that time the ASPCA was looking for, at that point, a corporate counsel.  And just what they do, saving animals from abuse and neglect and finding new and creative ways to end animal homelessness, which right now involves a lot of how to keep pets in homes, how to keep pets with people, how to provide services to people to allow them to keep their pets.  It’s everything I wanted.  So I have — as the legal department we play a fairly small role in the actual program work but every once in a while I get to go out and hang out with some dogs and — (laughs) in a professional capacity.  It’s a dream job.  It really is.

CLERK:	Thank you.

JONES:	Of course.

CLERK:	Do you get to have pets in your office?

JONES:	Every now and again.  Some of our offices are pet-friendly all the time.  We have some foster cats that live in offices.  I’m more of a dog person so I have three of them.  They can come visit me in the office from time to time but they don’t like them to be there every day.

CLERK:	Cool.  Thank you.

JONES:	Thanks so much.

CLERK:	Thank you.
