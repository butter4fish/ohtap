GEIS:	All right.  So, whenever you’re ready.

MANDICA-HART:	This is Olivia Mandica-Hart and Marilyn Carlson Nelson, class of 1961.  The date is May 20, 2011, and we are in the Alumnae Gymnasium at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts.  So, Ms. Nelson, you have had an incredibly successful career as a pioneer in business and leadership, internationally recognized and honored for your talents.  So we’re just going to back it up and focus, to begin with, on your time at Smith.  So why did you choose to come to Smith?

NELSON:	When I was a very young girl, maybe eight, my father, who had attended the University of Minnesota, was traveling in the East Coast, and he brought home a Smith t-shirt and a Wellesley t-shirt.  And my sister—my younger sister and I each received one.  I received the Smith one, and we asked about it and he explained that if you studied very hard, and did very well in school, that this would be one of the most exciting places a woman could be to be educated.  So I was quite touched by that, and I think it was very formative for me.  My sister doesn’t remember it, and for me, it was formative.

MANDICA-HART:	So how did you feel when you got here, for the first time?

NELSON:	Well, first of all, I visited Wellesley, and I visited several other schools, and everything matched at Wellesley.  And, as a Minnesota girl, I was so afraid that—what if I didn’t match?  And I got to Smith, and none of the buildings matched, and there was this kind of marvelous energy of variety and I thought, “Oh, this must be an inclusive place.  This is a place where, you know, I can find out who I am and be what I want to be, and I won’t have to match.”

MANDICA-HART:	And do you feel like Smith lived up to that expectation that you had?

NELSON:	Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I—but I did take my junior year abroad, and—my junior year in Geneva, where I studied international economics, and the classes at that time—some of the classes were at the University there in Geneva.  I took History of Economics from Monsieur Babbel, but then I took also graduate school courses at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Politiques Economiques.  And there—maybe there was one or two other Smith women, but the majority were young men from around the world who were really studying in—primarily to go into the political system, or the diplomatic corps.  And I really think my passion for international activity enhanced my ability to lead a global corporation, that I had developed a trust level and a sense of, actually, excitement about how diversity enhances creativity and productivity.  And I am forever grateful for that.

MANDICA-HART:	So Smith definitely played a role in your later career?

NELSON:	I think one of the things that Smith did for me, in particular, was that at Smith, any job that needed to be done was done by a woman.  So if—we had scientists, of course, artists, theatre majors, poets, journalists.  So it was stunning to graduate in 1961 and discover that the world was way behind in appreciating women’s capability and competency.  And it took me a long time to find a role as a job that used my skills as an economist.
So finally I did become a security analyst, and the best part was that they’d never had a security analyst woman, and none—there were no women stock brokers or investment folks in Minnesota, at that time.  And—but they made me sign my name, “M.C. Nelson,” because they said no one would buy stock recommended by a woman.  So I signed “M.C. Nelson.”  My daughters are shocked that I didn’t have a fit about it, but I was thrilled.  I would’ve called myself George, I think, if that’s what it took to have such a wonderful job.  And then I became pregnant, and when I told them, believe it or not, they were so upset because I now had a following, or “M.C. Nelson” had a following. But they didn’t want me to show any kind of—show that I was pregnant on the floor with all these men who were the stock brokers.  So they gave me a private office around the corner and upstairs, so I didn’t have to show and come into the building.
So that was really before the Civil Rights Act was passed, and before women could own property.  You had to have your son or your father or your brother sign for you.  So it was a very interesting and exciting time, and many of my colleagues were more angry—my friends—but for me, the challenge was, could I demonstrate competence and, in whatever circle I was in, earn respect and enough respect that people would begin to say, “Oh, maybe a woman could do this job?”

MANDICA-HART:	So sort of continuing off of that—or, that was earlier on—throughout your career, how has it—what has it been like to be a woman in business?

NELSON:	I think, in all honesty, being a woman at that point, it actually had—there were two sides of the coin.  There’s been no question that, having studied economics, being able to read a balance sheet and a P&L , having gone to work at Paine Webber—so my daily work was to analyze companies’ performance, and to get—dig into their numbers and understand what they were—what their potential was, that that qualified me when the world started opening up and inviting women to serve on corporate boards.
So there isn’t any question that a kind of affirmative action mood in the country after Title IX—Title V and Title IX, and all the discussions of inclusivity, that I was a beneficiary, that I was brought very young onto the board of a trust company, and then the board of a bank, and then the board of a telephone company.  And, of course, I have always teased that I had an upside-down career, because as a young woman, I was on all these big corporate boards and then—and did a lot of kind of local, national, and international volunteering.  And then, when I was older, I went into the corporation and ended up being the CEO of our company.

MANDICA-HART:	So, just to bring it back to Smith for a minute, how would you have described a typical Smith student when you were here?

NELSON:	I don’t know that there was a “typical Smith student.”  There was a variety.  I think we were a pretty serious bunch.  I think that the people who selected Smith in those days were women who already took themselves more seriously, at least academically.  I would say that many, many of us ended up married within weeks, if not days of when we graduated.   I just—I think the Smith students had intellectual curiosity.  They played a lot of bridge.
I never was a bridge player, because I—actually, my freshman year, I went over and auditioned for “Romeo and Juliet” at Amherst, and I got the part, which shocked me and everybody else.  And the next thing I knew, the President—Mr. Mendenhall—had to call my parents, because there were rules that, your freshman year, you couldn’t do anything until second semester, because you had to demonstrate that you could keep up with the work.   And so, needless to say, my bridge-playing was eliminated, because between studying and running all the way to Amherst for all the rehearsals—and then I stayed involved both here and at Amherst—so, I never developed much skill at bridge.  But there was a lot of bridge-playing going on.

MANDICA-HART:	So, other than theatre, were you involved in any clubs or organizations?

NELSON:	Let me think.  I did some journalism, a little bit—I wrote occasionally for the paper.  But I don’t have a great voice, so I didn’t sing.  A lot of people sang at Smith.  And I didn’t do a lot of athletics.  I danced.  Yeah, actually, I did quite a bit of dance.  There was a wonderful woman who had somehow been connected with Martha Graham, and we had a ballet of “The Crucible,” and we actually took it—trouped it a range of places on the coast.  And so, I’d forgotten all about that, until one of my classmates said, “Oh, you’re the dancer.”  And I thought, “Oh, I forgot all about that!”  Then I did direct Rally Day and since then, I’ve produced numerous kind of productions, whether they were corporate or community or even a big international production.  But that—producing that Rally Day show actually led to a lot of other exciting opportunities.

MANDICA-HART:	Looking back, what would you say is your proudest accomplishment?

NELSON:	Hmm.  Well I think any mom feels good about her children.  I’d say maybe being able to have—I had four children, and a great career, and 50 years of marriage—same guy, 50 years.  We’re here together, and it’s really fun, because we really kind of fell in love at a mixer at Wiggins Tavern.  So I’d say the fullness of my life, perhaps—things I’m proud of rather than the greatest accomplishment, and particularly proud that, when I went into Carlson—the company that I led—there were only two women in executive positions and when I left—well now I’m Chairman—and 48 percent of the executives are women.
We have been every year on The Great Place for Working Mothers list.  We’ve been a great place to work, and I feel very, very good about that.  And I feel particularly good, because it’s given young men an opportunity.  I find that young men are running off to pick up children at day care or whatever, after school and so on, and I think being a family-friendly corporation has been a differentiator for us.  I’m excited that we built new—I kind of took us into China.  We were early into India, and now we’ll be the largest non-domestic hotel brands in India.  And I believe, again, that some of this has been a result of the kind of breadth of thinking and experience that I had here at Smith.
And I agreed to sign—to end child prostitution and trafficking.  And I’ve become a 21st-century abolitionist, because I’m deeply concerned about human rights, both for women around the world and children, especially children who are being trafficked.  So I’ve worked with The World Bank and with the IMF and the United Nations on these projects.  So, in some ways, it’s not as much about pride or being proud, as it is humbled by the needs that are there, but also by the opportunities.  I’m sometimes surprised how often one person can actually make a big difference.  So my life has really been about inclusivity.  It’s interesting to come to a college which is de facto exclusive, not only intellectually, but also gender, and then to dedicate one’s life to being inclusive.  There’s an Edwin Markham poem that I particularly love.  It goes, “He drew a circle and left me out; heretic rebel, a thing to flout, but love and I had the wit to win; we drew a bigger circle, and drew him in.”

MANDICA-HART:	OK.  So do you still believe that single-sex education is important?

NELSON:	I believe that any institution that can empower women, give them a sense of ultimate accountability for their own lives is really valuable.  And if some people find that in a co-ed school, that’s great, but I also think that that powerful lesson that a community of women can be expert in and develop expertise in a whole range of disciplines, is really truly important.  It’s interesting, because I think the biggest lesson, having come out of a single-sex women’s school, is that I never felt that I could fall back on gender as an excuse.
At Smith, if you won a debate or lost a debate, it wasn’t because you were a woman.  It was because you weren’t as well-prepared, or you just didn’t do as—and articulate your point of view enough.  If you won or lost in a campus political battle, it was your own accountability.  So when I did—even at Paine Webber, where I was already sort of an independent woman there, if I didn’t do well, I didn’t say immediately—the first place I went in my mind was not, “Oh, it’s because I’m a woman.”  And I think that’s been very freeing.  I think that for people who fall back too quickly on being—on their gender being an excuse for their performance maybe aren’t holding themselves as accountable as they should.

MANDICA-HART:	So if you had to make the decision again, would you still come to Smith?

NELSON:	I think I almost made it by accident, and that it turned out to be an extremely formative and important part of my career.

MANDICA-HART:	Do you have any advice for current and future Smith generations?

NELSON:	I think, to take yourself seriously as students, that lifelong learning is essential, especially today, because things are changing so fast that—a discipline, a curiosity that you maintain and work at.  I think, being careful as women, we tend to have maybe a heightened emotional side, and that can be an advantage if we’re data-driven.  But, to argue from an emotional point of view, rather than a data-driven point of view, is to put yourself at risk.   And I also think that women need, and men as well—need opportunities to work cross-sector.
So, if I were coming back to Smith, I would try to do economics, politics, I would try to bring various disciplines and sectors together, because I find increasingly that the old model of silos is fine if you’re going to be a researcher or a Ph.D.  But if you really want to make change in the world, you need to be able to reach across sectors—public, not for profit, in business.  And finally, I’d make a plea to the next generation, not to simply believe that the only place you can make a difference is in a non-profit.  Business has a potential to be a great power for good, and I’d like to attract more of the best and the brightest into the corporate world as well.

GEIS:	Thank you.  I have a question—sort of a general question about—you have, it seems like, this wonderful sense of—there are limits.  Sometimes we’ll be having conversations with people in their interviews, looking back at their life, and they had to make some decisions along the way, some key points where, in order to do what they needed to do at that next point in life, it was to be at home with their children or a career.  And, for you, you’ve done both, and you’ve done brilliantly.  So could you talk a little bit about—were there choices that were not necessarily seen, or—how did you handle that?  How did you manage of all these, you know, incredible—what can be very overwhelming for some people, but it seems like you’ve been very graceful about your process.

NELSON:	First place, luck has a lot to do with–

GEIS:	You can look at Olivia.

NELSON:	Oh.  Luck has a lot to do with what happens in our lives.  But, early on, once I had my family, there was a moment where—I then went to work in our family company, and I had been promoted, and I went up to tell my dad—his office was a higher floor than mine—and I was so excited.  And he fired me.  He said, “Go home.  You need to go home.  Your husband’s a surgeon.  You can’t count on him being there.”  He actually was an expert in trauma, so he was called anytime of the day or night.  And I went down the back stairs with tears streaming down my face.  And then I really had to—it was a very important moment, because I had to decide—well, that wasn’t the only place to work.  I could go get a job somewhere else.  But I did have four children.
And I realized that, though I didn’t like him telling me that, that probably he was right.  And so I did go home, and I didn’t take another role at that point.  But, what I found was that I could do volunteer jobs, and for the longest time—well first I started doing volunteer jobs in the Junior League.  And that was a moment of pride too, because I introduced the first African-American into the National Junior League, and almost got kicked out.  Anyway, it worked.
But I found that I would take—I would be invited to be the chairman of some big event, or big program, and I would insist I have a co-chairman.  And some of the older women would coach me and they’d said, “Marilyn, you should have confidence in yourself.”  And I said, “It had nothing to do with that.”   I knew that I had to be available for my family, and so if we could share, and I think it’s—there’s a little lesson on—even for job sharing.  Sometimes people are so interested in the corporate setting to—they feel they can protect their job by having all this information and not sharing it.  But what happens is, then when someone is sick and you do have to go home, then the company resents the fact that you’re not there, because things fall– apart if you would share.  So for those years, I always would have a co-chair.  And it worked very, very well.  I got all the excitement of organizing things and being creative, having building teams.  But in the end, I had someone that I could fall back on, because I couldn’t fall back on my husband.  And then, as I was more and more successful with that and then, as the children got older, so that I had more time when they were in school, then I took—then I would chair an event.   And I found that the non-profit world at that point—the volunteer world, if you treated it as a kind of profession, you did a lot of networking.  I met—that’s really how I met so many of the powerful business leaders.  They tended to be men at that point, just like today.  And so then that’s—as I worked with them, and gained more and more respect, I ended up being—having bigger and bigger jobs.
So the governor asked me to try and convince the NFL to bring the Super Bowl to Minnesota, and I just spent hours having to think back to my Smith years.  But I had to memorize the names of all the owners and all these team records, and then I had to build a team and try to convince the NFL to come to Minnesota.  And it took nine years from the beginning of that project.  I finally told the head of the NFL, at one of our—one of our presentations—that I hoped that they would give it to Minnesota while I was still young enough to get up in the stands.  Anyway, when we won the Super Bowl, that sort of thrust what I did onto a, really, a global stage.  And that then opened a lot of additional doors.
I think a very wise man once told me, “The main thing is to keep the main thing—the main thing.”  Now that’s a funny statement.  But I knew that, for me, my children and my husband were really “the main thing.”  And I think, in its own way, that it was so clear to me that I did turn down some jobs.  I turned down some wonderful opportunities, because I knew that it would just put too much trust on the family, and it wasn’t worth it to me, because I knew that this family was the core of who I am, and that was clear.  I think, for some people, if it’s not clear, or if your sense that your career is so important—I have so many successful friends in business who have divorced or not had a family.  Some are really happy with their choice, and others aren’t.  For me, I knew my choice.   But I also knew that there was time.  And sometimes people want to get it done all at once, and they feel like they’ve somehow failed if they haven’t done that.
Now, that said, when women stop out in the corporate setting, you know, there are the studies that talk about women stopping out and, on average in the corporate setting, it’s about two-and-a-half years.  And so I’ve been working very hard on a couple of things.  One, I finally was invited to speak to a national HR group.  And so I gave them a little lecture about making sure that, instead of making someone feel guilty—because, they might stop out for an aging parent, they might stop out for a child—not usually the babies, it’s usually junior high when, you know, somebody needs to be around, and they’re worried.  But to keep people—to find a way to keep people involved.  You know, maybe give them a project so they can be involved on the Internet, and do things at night, or—keep people involved, because what tends to happen is they don’t—up until now, women don’t go back where they left.  And that’s just a crime, because they start—when they re-enter, they enter at a lower comp level, and it would better to find a way to say, “I understand that you have stop out.  We want you back. So how can we keep—help you feel current?”
And I’ve also spoken to a lot of business schools over the last few years, and now the good news is, several business schools are actually doing a kind of re-entry short course, so that new vocabulary or new concepts that people who are re-entering can utilize.  But I think, unless—I think you have to just accept that there may be trade-offs, if you want a family and a career—that, first of all, you’re the only parent your family has.  And there are a lot of other people in the—who can, at various times, probably do your job, maybe not as well.  If you keep that priority, and then have patience, and then realize that you may not get the next job.  But if you keep “the main thing the main thing”—if the job is “the main thing,” and for many people it is, then I really suggest that they’re thoughtful about whether—if they’re going to be a single parent, how they’re going to manage that.  Because unfortunately, today, the kids do tend to be suffering a bit.  It’s not necessary.

GEIS:	Do you—we would love to talk to you for a long time.  I’m going to let you go.  I’m just curious if you had anything to say about leadership, in terms of—I mean, you’ve written a lot about leadership.  You talked about inclusivity and the knowledge of women being able to do any job, basically, but are there any other little pieces that you—or pieces you’d like to share, in terms of women in leadership roles?

NELSON:	Well, in terms of leadership in general, I guess I’ve come to a couple of  conclusions.   One is that trust is the beginning of leadership, and ultimately we are willing to follow people we trust.  And sometimes I think that people—that today there’s a sense that things are moving so fast, that it’s gray area, and people forget that there really is quite a bit of clarity about right and wrong and about ethics.  And, ultimately, I believe that to build something—a team, or to build a community—that it starts with trust.  And that means being pretty consistent in the way you treat people, whether it’s superiors or peers or people who work for you.—authenticity, being who you are.
And sometimes I think when we’re starting our careers, that’s hard because we have role models, and so we try on different styles.  But I found that a whole range of styles work.  If they’re the one that’s really, legitimately who you are, so that there’s a consistency—I also think that being—collaborating and partnering with men is going to be really the next piece of—not so much feminism, per se, but this sense that the world’s problems now are so complex and we’re no longer—you know, we’re way past the time when it’s our brawn or our mechanical skill alone that would qualify us.  So in an intellectual, we should be able to partner as never before.  And I actually believe that the most successful organizations are led by teams, whether one person is the titular head—but pulls together various talents and can convince the group that they care as much about each others’ successes as their own.  I think it’s pretty clear, when you’re leading an organization, or leading a corporation, if you’re just interested in your—satisfying your own needs, people figure that out pretty quickly.
And, ultimately, I think it’s the downfall both of the individual and sometimes the corporation. We’ve certainly seen recently that some leaders, when the chips were down, just did what they could to get all they could in a greedy manner from the organization, and let the company fail.  There’s a definition of leadership that I particularly like.  It’s that “a leader is something who takes full responsibility for an organization and changes it for the better.”  I love that—“and changes it for the better,” that sense that something—you want to have an impact.  And that’s kind of been something I’ve applied—tried to apply—is before I would say yes to any particular role—I’ve said, “Do I have the time?  And how can I just have some kind of positive impact, between now and the time that I would leave?”
But, you know, my book says “how we lead matters,” and I do believe that, in the end, every one of us has leadership opportunities every day.  When I was at Smith, we read Lord Jim and, if you remember Joseph Conrad’s book, Lord Jim—as a reader, you’re aware that Lord Jim is failing all these little tests every day.  And he’s fantasizing that, when the moment comes, he’s going to be this great leader and he’s going to be a hero.  Well I think about that often, because I think we’re all tested every day.  We have little decisions that we make, or comments that we make that really demonstrate whether we’re leading and, essentially as—Gandhi says, “being the change we want”—or if we’re pointing fingers saying, “Why doesn’t someone else—why don’t they do something about it,” or “can you believe that they’re—you know, that they can’t get along?”
And then we turn around and don’t really look at ourselves.  So I think having emotional—some kind of emotional intelligence is really important, not just intellectual, but emotional is a key to leadership.   We have to balance our performance, on the one hand, and stewardship on the other: performance we need to compete, but stewardship we need to keep the perspective.  We need to protect the environment, we need to protect human rights, we need not to sell-out today—sell-out tomorrow for today.

MANDICA-HART:	Great.  Thank you very much.

NELSON:	Yes.
