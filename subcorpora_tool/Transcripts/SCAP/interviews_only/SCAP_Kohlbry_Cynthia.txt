REESE:	So this is Carolyn Rees and I am conducting an interview with Cindy Kohlbry on May 24th, 2013 for the Smith College Alumnae Oral History Project.
So thank you for being here and agreeing to participate.  So why are you attending reunion this year?
KOHLBRY:	I've attended every year since we graduated.  I am a headhunter and I love to connect people, and I am always anxious to see old friends and reminisce and learn new things.
REES:	Are a lot of your friends back this year as well?
KOHLBRY:	There's a good mix.  There are always people that say they're going to come and then at the last minute they don’t come, so some disappointments who weren't here, but good group of friends.  We all went to Joe's last night, one of our old haunts here.
REES:	Good, good.  So how did you choose to attend Smith?
KOHLBRY:	That's an interesting story.  I was a theater and psychology major and when I graduated from high school I really wanted to be an actress, and my very conservative Midwest parents – I'm from St. Louis, born and raised there – wouldn’t allow me to apply to conservatories because they thought it was very important that I get a liberal arts education.  The next thing was I wanted to go to school in California, and I was in high school during the '60s and early '70s and my parents were very conservative parents and said that I was not allowed to apply to any schools in California because they were far too liberal.  Why they thought Smith was a good choice I'm still not quite sure, but I was allowed to apply to Smith.  I applied early decision and I applied mostly because I love the theater complex which now must seem old to many of you but at the time was brand new state-of-the-art facilities.  I remember that they had a scene shop on an elevator so that even short people like me who were not necessarily strong could work on all the sets because they went up and down and made it very, very easy to be on the technical side, although I did mostly acting.  But that's why I applied.  I applied earlier decision and was lucky enough to get in, and the rest is history.
REES:	So tell me about your first few days at Smith and what you were expecting, feeling, et cetera.
KOHLBRY:	You know, I don’t know that I had huge expectations.  There are two funny stories.  My father went to Amherst.  He also is from St. Louis.  And I remember – my mother did not go to Smith.  She went to a women's college in Boston.  She was an elementary school teacher early in her life.  And I remember my mother being a little annoyed that my father knew his way around the campus so well and we didn’t need directions to find my dorm, and my mother was like, hmm, why is this?  And the only way he redeemed himself is that my first year I was on the fourth floor of Tyler House and my dad carried my trunk to the fourth floor -- and he's just a great guy.  He's still alive.  He's 85.  And he's been back to several of his Amherst reunions.  But he commented on the way up the steps, gee, I've never been above the first floor before.  So he was fascinated, and that kind of redeemed him with my mom, that he knew his way around the outside of the campus but had never been upstairs, so that was okay then.
But my first experience that I remember from the academic side was that I was pretty sure I wanted to be a theater major, so I was given a theater teacher, professor, as my advisor, and his name is Len Berkman (phonetic).  He's to this day one my absolute favorite people.  When you answered that security question when you forget your online password, who's your favorite teacher, my favorite teacher was Len, or is Len.  He's away unfortunately this Memorial Day weekend.  But I will never forget, I'm this little innocent thing from the Midwest sitting in this conference room with other theater majors and other people who'd simply been assigned as the advisor, and again, really conservative rooks, conservative family, I was here for adventures, and we're waiting and the advisor isn't there.  And I'm thinking, oh, no, I hope the advisor hasn’t quit or – you know, I have no idea what to expect.  All of a sudden this man bounds into the room – and if you know Len – full of energy, long bushy grey hair, I remember distinctly in a t-shirt and what looked like these huge Kedso Keds with this chunky piece of silver jewelry with a big peace sign at the bottom, and I was shocked that he was my professor, and I'm thinking, oh, no, what's going to happen.  Well, as it turns out, never have I met somebody who was so smart, so interesting, and so full of energy and genuine care about his students, and so he's one of the people I keep in touch with to this day.  But I will never forget that first impression as he bounded into the conference room and I'm thinking, like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, uh-oh, Toto, we aren't in Kansas anymore.
REES:	Yeah.  That's great.  So what house did you live in?
KOHLBRY:	Tyler.
REES:	Okay.  And what was the house community at Tyler like?
KOHLBRY:	So it turns out that almost all of us had applied early decision because – I don't know how it works now, but at the time it depended on when you were admitted and when I guess you paid to come, how you got the priority of your house assignments.  And so clearly, since I was going to be a theater major I thought and spend a lot of time in the music department, I picked the house that was closest to both of those.  I ended up double majoring in psychology, so every day I either went out the front door or the back door of Tyler, and it was very convenient.  And at the time everybody ate in their houses anyway, but we had one of the bigger kitchens and, you know, it was a house and a family and a wonderful community, very diverse, lots of science majors, lots of music and theater majors, but plenty of others too.  So the only thing I think that defined us as a group was that we'd all mostly been given our first choices.
REES:	Right.  So how did you – what was the process of deciding on your second major, psychology?
KOHLBRY:	So I ended up being – I was the first class that was – we called ourselves the incompetent class because we had no competency requirements.  We didn’t have to take any distribution of classes.  So I mostly took classes I liked, and I loved the psychology classes, and so halfway through junior year I realized I had enough classes to double major, and so I was going to graduate in three years and instead I stayed an extra semester and graduated in three-and-a-half, and took two more classes in psychology, and that's kind of how it happened.  I don't know that there was a lot of thought that went into any of the decisions.  They kind of just happened.
REES:	Yeah.  Did your class know that you didn’t have any distribution requirements?
KOHLBRY:	Oh, yes.  We have buttons that say, 1978, the first incompetent class.  We're very proud of it.  I actually, in retrospect, don’t think it was such a good idea, because if you come here for a liberal arts education I think you could benefit by being asked to take a distribution of classes, but anyway, that's all in hindsight.
REES:	So what were some of your favorite or most memorable courses?
KOHLBRY:	Well, I loved Len Berkman's Modern European History.  Interestingly, I also loved a statistics class that I took in psychology.  And I ended up as investment banker when I left Smith, so I must have been pretty good at math and just not realized it.  Psychology was very interesting. There were several classes there that I took that I loved, but mostly it was my theater classes.  In my senior year we were allowed to do a special project.  I can't remember what it was called now.  But I did a one-woman show which was great fun, and Len was my advisor for that too.  And I also loved taking voice.  I took voice from Adrian Auerswald (phonetic) who is sadly deceased now, but she was somebody I saw every week who worked with me one-on-one.  She's a fabulous singer, she was a very accomplished musician, and just an incredibly nice person.  She never had children of her own and all of us who took voice lessons from her felt like she was our mom, and so she really was my mom away from home.  Makes me very sad she's not here.
REES:	Yeah.  so were you involved with any extracurriculars?
KOHLBRY:	As a theater major, I was involved in a lot, but mostly in the theater.  I also was in a small a cappella singing group, the Smiffenpoofs, which, by the way, in case anybody needs to be corrected, they were the first a cappella group here at Smith.  Somebody called our rival group the first, but we were the first.  We were formed in the 1930s sometime.  So I did that.  That was four rehearsals a week, lots of traveling, singing at other people's schools.  I was in many, many productions.  I mostly was an actress, but you had to learn how to do lights and sound and sets.  And I do think that theater majors have a very tough time at a school like this because you really learn to be incredibly disciplined with the time you have to do the rest of your work, because there isn't much of it and, again, you're trying to keep up with people who could choose not to do any extracurricular activities.
REES:	Right, absolutely.  So what are some of your favorite Smith traditions?
KOHLBRY:	Traditions.  Well, I don't know that they're Smith traditions, but I was the – I am the program chair for this reunion, so I made everybody go to Joe's last for dinner. We were supposed to bike to Miss Florence Diner in Florence.  It rained so we walked – or some walked, I drove.  So we went to Miss Flo's.  We're going to Fitzwilly's for lunch.  We’re going to climb Mount Tom on Sunday morning.  Those were some of the favorite things that I remember, but they aren't necessarily Smith traditions.  I'm trying to think what – tell me, what's your favorite Smith tradition?  Maybe it'll help me remember what – I mean I love coming back to reunion for Illumination, but truly I don't really remember it except at graduation, so I don’t think I did that often.  Obviously Mountain Day was fun, and that's why we're going to Mount Tom.  I can't really think of any other real traditions.  We had lots of traditions in the theater and lots of traditions in Smiffenpoofs, but I'm not sure I was ever part of the real fabric of Smith-instituted transitions.
REES:	Right.  Talk about the theater ones.  Yeah, what are some of the traditions from your theater, your Poofs' experience?
KOHLBRY:	Well, you know, I mean there were lots of green room activities.  It's where I perfected my bridge game.  You do a lot of waiting in the green room.  I'm trying to think.  You know, I don’t think any of them truly classify as traditions.  They're just more the favorite memories I guess I have of being here.  I love the tradition of eating in our houses.  I love the tradition of tea in the afternoon.  That was also big time, we played bridge.  If we were going to give ourselves a break that was usually when we did it, and we had fun.
REES:	So what are some of your favorite memories from your time at Smith?  What comes to mind first if you think of --
KOHLBRY:	Well, I loved singing in the Smithinpoofs.  I'm friends with most of the people in the group to this day.  I loved the people that I met, and I actually love coming back to reunions because there are always people that I didn’t really know who I meet all over again really, and everybody's so interesting and accomplished in many different ways, and there's always something fun to find out that's new about people, so I guess that's what I like the best.  Memories of people and fun things we did.
REES:	So how would you describe a typical Smithy during your time at Smith?
KOHLBRY:	We were kind of all over the place.  We were in a transition group where – I was in the first class of women hired at Citibank who were allowed to join the management training program directly rather than being service assistants or secretaries.  So we were at a time when people were actually trying to fill their quota of qualified women, and so that sort of changed the dynamic of much of what went on.  I think we certainly had settled down from some of the radicalism of the '60s, but I will tell you that when people ask me my politics I still answer will march if necessary.  And there were many of us who were still activists in that way for women's rights and women's freedom to choose and all sorts of other things.  But I would also tell you that there were a fair number of very traditional people still here who didn’t feel quite comfortable with that.  Anyway, my class laughingly refers to me as the missing link.  I see – and so I'm a good headhunter.  I love to connect people.  I always remember different things about people.  And so I would tell you that there's incredible diversity of perspective in our class that I really love and still love to connect with, just because everybody wasn’t the same.  And maybe it's more homogenous now.  In my time it really wasn’t.  There were lots of different factions, some of whom didn’t know each other, which is why I was the missing link.  Mostly for fundraising reasons, by the way, but anyway.
REES:	So can you expand a bit more on the activism of the time.  Like what was the political climate like on campus?
KOHLBRY:	Well, I would say it was probably a lot more conservative than it was in the '60s.  I have many Smith friends who were here then.  Probably a little bit less of the drug culture of the hippies of the '60s, although my friends did a fair amount of partying.  I think it was a time when people really were reconsidering their roles, what was possible.  Our panel lecture tomorrow is "Do We Have it All?" and I suspect that many of us are kind of sick of being asked that, because we were being asked that at the time when there were so many possibilities for us, what is it that you want, and I think many of us in our careers tried to have it all, which I think basically is impossible.  So that's kind of what the climate was.  You know, there were a lot of issues that had come up on women's reproductive rights.  There was a lot of activism around the African-American population here, wanting to create more of a separate identity and feeling more welcome.  There were – well, there are always the divides of the lesbian culture and, you know, were people being inclusive or not inclusive.  And there were lots of complications because of that dynamic.  But many of us were strong proponents of people's freedom to do what they wanted to do and to be honored from the perspective that they came from, and so there was at least a consciousness about that.  I did work in Washington, I think it was my junior summer – maybe it was my sophomore summer, I can't remember now.  Whenever you do the summer internships.  And I worked for the Women's Equity Action League, and I will remember one of the reasons I became an investment banker is I was so furious by the end of the summer because all of these things at Smith that were so important about women's rights and just understanding and honoring our history as women and the roles that we could play seemed to be totally discounted by Washington, and you'd walk into people's offices and say, I'd like to speak to the person – your legislative assistant in charge of women's issues, and there would be no one.  and I quickly realized that without any money or power or reason, people didn’t care, and so I kind of vowed after that summer that I never again wanted to be in a situation where I didn’t have power to influence.  And I don't know that I made the right decisions in terms of what I ended up doing, but that was certainly a big issue.
But do you have any particular questions about things on campus?  Because I don’t – I remember everybody being very provocative, very – you know, some of my favorite conversations in the whole world took place over dinner.  And people would debate any number of current events, things they had learned in classes.  It was always intellectual stimulating and challenging and fun.
REES:	Was there an increase in students of color who were admitted to Smith during your time, or did you notice an increase?
KOHLBRY:	I don't know whether there was an increase in the admissions.  That part I guess I don't know.  I just know that my own personal experience was that I had – we lived in suites in Tyler, some of us did, and for whatever reason I was the only person who would identify as white in the suites that I lived in, and I became very close friends with the people, all lack of whom were African-American, in my suite, and I know that to varying degrees, even within that population, there was a lot more activism and a lot more of a push to recognize and to honor their traditions and perspectives.  So it was – I know it was a hot topic and something that, you know, is – I guess I would define myself certainly back then as a person who was completely unconscious about my white privilege, and even though I started to understand some of the privileges that men had because of gender, that was very eye-opening for me.  So I'm not sure I'm the best person to tell you what it was like before or what changed.  It's just that it was very much in our consciousness to be aware of each other, to honor each other, to respect each other, and to – you know, the one thing that sometimes hurt is when people wanted to segregate into their group, whatever their group might be, and understanding that that was something, again, to honor and not to feel excluded, which was my natural inclination is that I hated to be excluded from anything.
REES:	Right, right.  And you mentioned that lesbianism was also a hot topic of the time.  Can you expand a bit more on that>
KOHLBRY:	I don't know so much of a hot topic as just that, you know, I grew up in this very conservative Midwestern environment where – I was in the theater so certainly I interacted with many people who would have identified as gay or lesbian, but I probably was naïve on that front too, about I guess we call it now marriage equality, you know, having equal rights.  I mean those things just didn’t even occur to me.  Once they did, I became a pretty active and vigorous supporter, but that was also very eye-opening.
REES:	So how did Smith prepare you for life after Smith, and what did you do?
KOHLBRY:	Well, it both prepared me –
REES:	And what did you do?
KOHLBRY:	Oh, okay.  So what I did after Smith, for whatever unknown reason I was here making a record for the Smithinpoofs and I had a couple of solos, so I stayed on campus as long as I could, sleeping on people's floor, and if you don’t anybody, you know, the kitchen liked me, they would still feed me, even though I officially wasn’t supposed to be here, and every day I'd put on my little grey business suit and tromp up to the career development office, and because I was an actress I'd read all the material and then usually do a pretty good interview for the job.  And I started getting all these callbacks when I was back in St. Louis desperately missing my friends, and Citibank offered me a job, and everybody who wanted to work at Citibank was like, Cindy, Cindy, you’ve got to go take the job, and I'm thinking, I do?  Why?  You know, I don't know that I want to be even in New York, maybe I want to be in Boston instead or – anyway, so I took the job, and I do believe that behaviorally they found me – because it was a good behavioral fit for me – but half of my friends who were pretty liberal, some of them Marxists, were, you’ve sold your soul to the devil, how can you go work for Citibank, and I guess again, you know, I just didn’t even know any better, but that's how I fell into it.  There was no design.  They found me.  They were very smart about behavioral interviewing.  They obviously wanted a quota of qualified women so they'd come to Smith.  So that's what I did.
But now I've forgotten what – you asked me what I did, but you also asked something else and I forgot what you asked.
REES:	How did Smith prepare you –
KOHLBRY:	Oh, for that.
REES:	– after?
KOHLBRY:	Not at all.  And also, tremendously.  So the not at all part is I am one of two children.  A younger sibling who's a girl.  I went to an all-women's school from 2nd grade through 12th grade, and then I go to an all-women's college.  So much of what of what occurs to me didn’t occur to other people.  I never was told not to lean in or to be quiet or to stay in the background or any of those things, so I just assumed that's the way I was supposed to be.  I will tell you that a lot of the bonding that goes on is difficult though.  I was one of the only women in doing what I did, and that Smith didn’t prepare me for, being in a man's world.  And so in many ways I'm not sure that I approached all of it in the wisest possible way in terms of developing relationships, because ultimately what you want in a career is for people to take chances on you, and as in life, most people don’t take chances unless they feel safe and comfortable taking chances on you.  And so clearly, people took chances if you were the best or could be, you know, in the top 10, but people were scared of you if they didn’t know you and didn’t feel that they could relate to you, and so some of those things really I wasn’t well prepared for.  So I think in the end it served me very well, but there was still a lot to learn because I'd come from an environment that really wasn’t real world.  And I would really recommend women's education to anyone at some point because I think it's important to have that ability to know that everything is possible, but I also think that it's a detriment if you don’t understand building relationships with people, whoever they might be, and I'm not sure that I learned enough about that, frankly.
REES:	So I know that you have to get to your Fitzwilly's –
KOHLBRY:	Fitzwilly's lunch.
REES:	So we'll do a couple of wrap-up questions.  But what keeps you coming back to reunion?
KOHLBRY:	I love Smith, I love my friends, I love the excuse to see them.  I also love the intellectual stimulation that comes from it.  I love going to Alumnae College.  I'm so glad that they have it as an official part of the reunion.  I can't wait to go to the lectures this afternoon and tomorrow.  We invited a lot of our old professors to dinner on Saturday night, and just even hearing some of the things that they're working on and talking about, I don’t get enough of that really in my life anymore.
REES:	Do you have any advice for current and future Smithies?
KOHLBRY:	Well, I guess – it depends on what topic – but I guess in general I would say get as much out of it as you can.  It's a great chance to really prepare yourself for any number of things that can stimulate you later in your career and in life.  And the discipline of studying and researching and really learning is such a great gift, and even though at the time maybe, you know, we thought we had too much stress and too much pressure, I loved those days of really digging deep and understanding things from an audience of classmates and professors who really wanted to help you think better, smarter, faster.  The critical thinking skills that you develop if you work here, you know, if you work at it here, I think are invaluable, and I miss that.
REES:	Yeah.
KOHLBRY:	The other thing I guess I would say, because my field is, you know, now I'm a headhunter, I've been a headhunter for the last 15 years – I really advise people to not assume there's any right or wrong way of doing anything when it comes to your career.  The important thing is authenticity, and if you can, to never lose track of who you are and feel comfortable being who you are.  So that there's not a perfect way to write a résumé or a perfect way to do an interview.  There are 250 books written in the last three years, all of which contradict each other.  I mean it's very hard to navigate.  So it's important to just be conscious of your choices and conscious of what serves you and what doesn’t serve you.  And I really am a big proponent of being passionate about who you are and what you love and letting the rest fall into place, and I don’t think I understood it at the time but that's pretty much what happened to me.
REES:	Awesome.  Well, thank you for participating.  That was great.
KOHLBRY:	Thank you.  This was fun.
