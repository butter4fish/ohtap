BICKERTON:	Get to use the ranch.

WILLIAMS:	(unclear).  And I’m ready when you’re ready.  OK.  This is Bethy Williams, here with Mary Bickerton.  It’s May 20, 2011.  So, thank you for agreeing to be part of this project.  How did you choose Smith initially?

BICKERTON:	My guidance counselor had some connection to Smith.  And I wanted to go to a women’s college.  I’d had a rough time in my adolescence.  The boyfriend that I had at the time had injured me, and I really wanted to be away from men, boys, at the time.  So, it seemed like a really great place for healing, and my choices were Vassar or Smith at the time.  I picked Smith because when I talked to the woman from Vassar, her kids were screaming in the background on the phone, and I thought, Hmm- this doesn’t sound too good.

WILLIAMS:	Smith seemed like a safe place.

BICKERTON:	Yes.  Very much so.

WILLIAMS:	So, where are you from originally?

BICKERTON:	I was living in Long Island most of my childhood, but I was, for one year, in Florida.  My parents had moved down there for one year.  So I had come here from Florida.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah?  And was Smith a healing place like you thought it was going to be?

BICKERTON:	Very much so.  I was well-fed (laughs). I was well-rested.  I loved my studies; I enjoyed it very much.  And the nature and the beauty of the campus is something that I’ve always remembered, and I think I got my life-long love of gardening from here.

WILLIAMS:	Wow!  How were you involved with gardening while here?

BICKERTON:	I just have a little garden in my– well, here, I took Horticulture and I took Botany, and I just loved– it was– Greg Armstrong was the head of the buildings and grounds at the time, and I just loved that class and horticulture.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.

BICKERTON:	And of course, walking back and forth and seeing all the trees was amazing.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  Was there a lot of, like, women who went to college in your family?

BICKERTON:	None at all.  I was the first woman who went to college.  My grandmother hadn’t graduated from sixth grade, I think, and my mother was a nurse, so she’d gone to a couple of years of nursing school.  So, I was the first, and, you know, my uncle used to call me “College Kid” whenever he saw me.

WILLIAMS:	So they were supportive of your–

BICKERTON:	Oh, very much so.  Very much so.

WILLIAMS:	And they liked the idea of Smith as well?

BICKERTON:	They didn’t have that much to do– it’s not like now where the parents make the decisions for the kids.  I just– my guidance counselor told me that he suggested I apply here, and I got the scholarship.  I did the application myself, completely.  And I only applied to two colleges, and, you know, it was pretty much on my own, and they had not much to do with it.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  So once you were here, were you involved with any particular clubs or organizations?

BICKERTON:	My freshman year, I was in the choir Omega, which I loved -- I had been in the high school choir growing up -- and I sang.  I met one of my friends, (Luellen Ambrose?), who’s been a life-long friend there.  And I still remember this song about the pancakes with the dishwater in it (laughs), so–

WILLIAMS:	(unclear)

BICKERTON:	Yeah, it was about– somebody who didn’t want the husband her mother picked out, and she put dishwater in the pancakes.

(laughter)
So, it was a fond memory.  And I also volunteered through service organizations of Smith, and I met my future husband, to whom I’m still married, at Belchertown State School.  So I volunteered, and we would drive a van over to the institution once a week and have activities.  And that’s where I set eyes on Scott (laughs), so the rest was history!  He’s the father of my children.

WILLIAMS:	How many children do you have?

BICKERTON:	I have twins, identical twin girls.  So, he was at UMass Amherst, and I didn’t meet him there.  You know, the social life– we were very studious in Martha Wilson House.  I would study, pretty much, seven o’clock to eleven o’clock every night, and, you know, we would go out Saturday night or something, but it wasn’t as social as I hear it is now.

WILLIAMS:	So, since you were here in the 1970’s -- you’re Class of 1976 -- what do you think the dialogue was, for example, around the Vietnam War on campus?

BICKERTON:	I remember very little about that.  I know there was a boycott of lettuce, and my friend (Luellen?) was involved with boycotting the grapes for the United Farm Workers, and boycotting the lettuce because it was exploiting farm workers.  But I heard very little about the Vietnam War in ’72 to ’76.  I know a lot of the men you would meet would say, “What’s your draft number?” and that sort of thing, but I don’t remember much talk about it.  We were very focused on our studies.

WILLIAMS:	What about feminism?  Was there a lot of that?

BICKERTON:	Feminism -- big thing, very much so.  I took the Sociology course that focused on, you know, women and women’s liberation, women’s identity, and I found that very eye-opening.  I think it had a lasting impression on me.  At the time, I remember us being taught that only seven percent of lawyers were women, and, you know, it’s fifty percent.  And I became a lawyer eventually, so, I always remember that figure.  And just the readings really opened my eyes, and they showed us the video of “Killing Me Softly,” which showed how women are manipulated through advertising.  And a lot of discussions: I know I was very much challenged by the professor -- it might have been Martha Fowlkes, but there was another co-teacher who also lectured.  And you know, I had some sexist assumptions that I’d picked up along my– growing up.  And I can remember her challenging them, and, you know, it kept me on my toes (laughs).

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  And informally, like, outside of the classroom, was there a lot of talk going on as well?

BICKERTON:	You know, I’m a little dim on that, I have to say (laughs).  We had big talks, but nothing’s coming to mind right now.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  That’s fine.

BICKERTON:	I do remember when Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs, that male chauvinist pig who said that no woman could ever play tennis as well as he did, and it was the “Game of the Century,” whatever, “Match of the Century,” and Billie Jean King beat him, and when that was announced, everyone blasted up their stereos with “I am woman, hear me roar,” and everyone ran outside in the quad, and they were having, like, an impromptu parade and cheering and celebrating and it was, you know, it was just a great feeling of power and, you know, feeling celebrated.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  And to be with these Smith women, that must have been incredible.

BICKERTON:	It was great; it was great.  For me, I was a little bit in a state of shock while I was here about issues of class, because I was on scholarship, and I worked in the kitchens.  So, you know, I’d be the one who’d be schlepping the dirty dishes.  And a lot of things about clothing and fitting in.  So, I loved it here and I was also awkward at times.  And I can remember a debutante on my floor talking to her mother about– they were arguing about a $35 blouse, which– that was how much I would make each week, in my job.  So (laughs), you know, I was a little bit in a state of shock, and sometimes I would judge people because I was insecure about not having money.  Yeah.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  So that was a big culture shock?

BICKERTON:	Yeah.  I think the Financial Aid kids– we would sit together, pretty much.  And the kitchen workers– a lot of my– some of my meals I would eat with the kitchen help, so, with, like, the nights you had kitchen duty, you would eat with the help.  So that was fine; I liked them; they were nice.  They were really sweet.

WILLIAMS:	So do you think Smith was, like, overall an accepting place for people who’d come from a different background?

BICKERTON:	Well, you know, I think it’s changed more, more along that line.  When I was there, the African-American women sat in the corner, in one table, and with few exceptions, they didn’t mingle with the rest of the students.  It was different.  And I remember once we had some kind of banquet, and I was the help for the banquet, so I ended up sitting at “the black table,” and no one spoke to me.  So there was a schism of race at the time, which, you know, I think back of it in shame and regret, but that’s how it was at the time.

WILLIAMS:	And it’s– I thought that was an interesting story, how you were at the black table, in the same situation, but still there was no dialogue–

BICKERTON:	Yeah.  It was strange, yeah.

WILLIAMS:	So...so, did you go abroad at all when you were here?

BICKERTON:	No, I didn’t.  I didn’t realize that I could have done it as a Financial Aid student, so I didn’t even ask.  So, I stayed.  I was working a lot.  I had my kitchen job and I worked– later years, I worked at the Belchertown State School 20 hours a week.  And I had some little odd jobs that I did: I delivered the Sophian, and I had– my later boyfriend who became my husband, I did some farm work scrubbing squashes or something.  So I had miscellaneous jobs to keep myself going.

WILLIAMS:	So you really had to work to stay in school?

BICKERTON:	Oh, yeah, I did.  I did.  I got B+ average, so, you know, my dorm was very, very studious.  People– one of my hall mates is now a doctor and she does dog rescue and all this– they were very studious.

WILLIAMS:	And it’s interesting to me that you didn’t know that you could go abroad.  Did they– was that information not readily available to people who were on aid or–

BICKERTON:	I don’t know.  Maybe I just wasn’t– I was sort of in a numb state sometimes when I was here.  The first day I got here, I’ll never forget it.  They served watermelon and fried chicken.  Now, these are two foods that I had never eaten without, like, holding them in my hands and sticking my face in them, and I saw all these young ladies eating the watermelon with a knife and a fork, and (laughs) eating fried chicken with a knife and a fork.

WILLIAMS:	(laughs) That happened to me too, the same thing!

BICKERTON:	I can’t believe it!  I just sat there looking at them, and I was just so hungry.  And I remember thinking, OK, how am I going to do this?  (laughs)  So when my mother first drove me up, I said, “Please take me home!  I can’t bear it!”  These big, grand buildings, and I guess they’re a little less grand now, but they had Oriental frogs, and all the young ladies were dressed so nice in big, fancy cars and everything, and the buildings looked so, I don’t know, so posh or something.  So, I said, “Please take me home!  I’ll work in the Five & Ten.  I don’t want to go to college!  Take me home.”  And she, of course, said, “I drove you up here, and you’re going to stay!” (laughs)  So, she left me.

WILLIAMS:	Are you glad she made you stay?

BICKERTON:	Oh yes, of course!  I mean, it’s...having Smith on the résumé  is always– you get an interview for the job, and people respect it, and, you know, it’s kind of a ticket to open doors.  And I did enjoy all the feeling of those sheets, those sheets they would give us every Tuesday, and they’d deliver the clean sheets and you’d get in the bed, and I loved it!  That was one of my fondest memories!

WILLIAMS:	I wish they still did that for us (laughs).  That would be nice!

BICKERTON:	Yes.  And oh my goodness.  Eating dinner in the dorm, candlelight dinner on Thursdays, that was wonderful.  And the Yorkshire pudding and all that (laughs).  And then I remember, you know, tea on– I don’t know if it was Thursday or Friday, but we’d have the afternoon tea once a week.  This one woman would play the piano.  We’d have our cookies and people would be playing bridge.  I never knew how, but they would play bridge.  It was wonderful.  Very happy.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  Even though maybe a little painful at times with the class stuff?

BICKERTON:	Oh , yeah, I mean, it was kind of, like, that, you know, I guess that period of life anyway when you’re 18 to 22, you’re going through the ups and downs.  So, you know, one day I’d be crying, crying, and then the other time I’d be walking around feeling like the top of the world.

WILLIAMS:	Right.  So, life after Smith.  As a Smith graduate, what did you expect in terms of work, family, marriage, I mean, what were you taught to expect?

BICKERTON:	Well, when I got out of Smith, I didn’t– I was on my own.  And I got enough money to get up my first month’s rent by cleaning the dorms, which I notice are still just as clean.  So I spent a week, you know, on my hands and knees with a broom, sweeping the dorm rooms in Martha Wilson.  And I made, like, $125 or something, so that was enough for my first month’s rent.  And I did get a job working with developmentally disabled people in a group home that I lived with later.  So, I was not one of these who went right to the stock market or anything.  I was kind of starting from scratch.  I didn’t have a lot of grand expectations.  Really, I just wanted something so I could pay my bills for a while and, you know, see what I could do.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  Looking back, would you encourage your daughters to go to Smith?

BICKERTON:	I tried to get them to go.  I– very– and you know, my daughter [Anne] -- the older of my twins -- said, “Mom, you told me I should go to Smith, and you were right, and I wish I had listened to you!” (laughs) because she was very unhappy at Hamilton College.  She said, “Everyone who went to Smith loves it and was very happy, and they have such a network and they have so many friendships.”  So she regrets that she didn’t go, but I’m just really, really happy, myself, that I went.  I encouraged my niece– I always try to, if I know anyone who’s in, you know, the sixteen-year-old ballpark, I encourage them to go, because of the opportunities.  And now, I understand, there’s all the sciences, and it’s so much more opened up.

WILLIAMS:	Right.  What do you think the typical Smithie is like now?

BICKERTON:	Well, I hear that one-third of them are science majors?  And so, I know they’re all very, very smart.  When I was– they have these– I guess they call them “ambassadors,” but they’re sort of babysitters for us ladies who make sure we don’t wander off (laughs).  And I asked each of them, “What’s your major?”  They said, “Neuroscience.”  We didn’t have Neuroscience!  So there were a lot of Art History majors back in the day, it seemed.  A lot of English majors, Art History majors.  And I think some people didn’t expect to work at the time.  You know, maybe they would work at a little job for a while, and then they’d get married and have kids, because I still remember one senior came in freshman year, in May of freshman year, and she walked in and held up her hand with a diamond ring for the engagement, and everyone stood up and clapped for her that she was engaged (laughs).  And I thought, Oh, my goodness, that’s bizarre.

WILLIAMS:	And you just never thought of any of that; it didn’t make sense to you?

BICKERTON:	No.  But I think that, you know, some of these students that were seniors, they were just wanting to get married and have some kids and live in Shaker Heights or wherever.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah, and you always thought, “I need to work.”

BICKERTON:	Yeah, that was my reality, is I need to work.  But, I mean, now, things worked out well.  I’m a lawyer; I’ve got a job and get lots of money.  So, everything’s fine.  You know, I don’t have to struggle like I did.

WILLIAMS:	If you had to sum it up in a few, quick minutes, what difference would you say your Smith education has made for you?

BICKERTON:	Just, it gave me a life-long love of learning and reading, self-confidence as a woman, and I think, you know, it was a place for me to heal from my traumatic– my parents had divorced that year that I left for college, and that boyfriend had injured me– so it was a very healing time for me.  And I went to see– they had a counselor at the– now it’s called Mason Health Center, but it was Charles Birch– and he was very, very helpful to me and sort of figuring myself out, so that was enormously helpful.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  And I guess we’re running out of time–

BICKERTON:	Thank you so much.  This was fun.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  Thank you very much.

BICKERTON:	Go to Smith, whoever you are!

(laughter)
