KRAUS:	Yeah, we’ve had a lot of people coming from crazy distances —

REVULURI:	Pretty far away, yeah.

KRAUS:	— Which is great.  So, I mean, it’s very informal.  We’re just going to talk a little about your time before Smith and during Smith and after Smith and –

REVULURI:	Cool.

KRAUS:	Yeah.  My name is Maggie.  Did I say that?

REVULURI:	Yes.

KRAUS:	I realize that I — that there’s been a couple people that I haven’t introduced myself until to (unclear)

REVULURI:	It must be hard to remember when you’re doing it, like, a hundred times, right? (laughter) Or dozens of times, anyway.

KRAUS:	Yeah.  We did this all day yesterday; we’re doing it all day again today.

REVULURI:	It’s really great.  I think it’s a great idea.

KRAUS:	Yeah, I’m really glad that people have been interested in doing it.

REVULURI:	I think it’s just hard to find a slot —

KRAUS:	Yeah.

REVULURI:	Because you know, I was like, “Kelly, I could do it at eleven-thirty or noon on Saturday.”

KRAUS:	That’s it.

REVULURI:	She’s like, “okay.” (laughter)

KRAUS:	Yeah, definitely.  Okay.  Let’s see.  We’re going to be about a half an hour, maybe a little shorter because for some reason we’re over time.  Do you know if — do you have the schedule?   Do you know if someone is coming in at — we actually —Dr. Sindhu, we have a lunch break so there’s — we could have a little (unclear) there.

REVULURI:	Okay, great.

KRAUS:	Okay, so just for the record, this is Maggie Kraus and I’m conducting an interview with Sindhu Revuluri on May 15, 2010, for the Smith College Alumni Oral History Project.
So first of all, thank you so much for coming, and taking time out of your busy weekend to do this.  I guess we’ll just start with a little bit about how you got to Smith and what the choice to come to Smith meant to you.

REVULURI:	I had a kind of guidance counselor-type figure in high school who had also gone to Smith.  I think she graduated in, like, ’76 or something like that, so she was the person who kind of planted that seed in my head, and then I had a high school — I think history — teacher who also when he found out that I was thinking about it was very encouraging, he thought that would be a really good place for me.  And I think at that time I didn’t really understand why they thought that but it kind of made sense.  I was looking at liberal arts schools and then when I came to visit I really just fell in love with the place.

KRAUS:	Were you from New England, were you from this area?

REVULURI:	No, I grew up outside of Chicago.

KRAUS:	Okay, so it was a little bit of a reach –

REVULURI:	It was.

KRAUS:	– distance-wise.

REVULURI:	Yeah.

KRAUS:	Yeah.  So, I mean, how did that impact you or your family, your decision to go to the East Coast and –

REVULURI:	You know, I think by the time it was narrowed down to the three or four schools I was really serious about, they were all kind of in this area.  There’s something really romantic, I think, about the sort of New England college experience, so, and I think also when we visited, my parents also really liked it and they liked the setting.  We also saw Mount Holyoke and I think we kind of got used to the brick building, you know, trees everywhere, fall foliage kind of image of what college would be like.

KRAUS:	So were the older women in your family or in your life college graduates?  College graduates from women’s — all-women’s colleges?

REVULURI:	No, actually, my mother went to school in India and she went directly from high school to medical school and she completed all her schooling in India.  My grandmother, I think, went to school until sixth or seventh grade on my mother’s side.  On my father’s side I’m not sure she went to school ever.  She never knew how to read or write.  She would always sign cards — birthday cards — with her fingerprint.

(laughter)

REVULURI:	My father has a Ph.D.  He — in engineering — and he got his bachelor’s and master’s in India and then he moved to the United States for school.  That’s how they ended up in the U.S.  So there is definitely a kind of commitment to education with both my parents but I think they didn’t quite understand, like, what a liberal arts school was as opposed to an engineering school or a medical school.  But strangely I think the single sex aspect really appealed to them because that happens a lot in India, you have a women’s school or a men’s school and it’s not for the same purpose as it is here, it’s not sort of empowering, I think.  I think it’s just segregation, or separation, anyway.

(laughter)

KRAUS:	So what were your expectations, I mean, you visited before you came, what did you kind of imagine your life would be like if you were here?

REVULURI:	I think I always had the sense that it was going to be somewhat intense from all the literature I’d read and the women I’d met it seemed like there was — there was a real passion about whatever it was.  I mean, each of them were different, but I kind — I think I knew that there was no way to kind of just get through it half asleep or anything like that.  It seemed like a place where you really just — you dive in and you milk it for everything that it is and then that’s really what it ended up being for me, too.

KRAUS:	Right.  So, I mean, when you got here in the fall, what was that feeling like?  Were you overwhelmed, was there a lot of adjusting –

REVULURI:	Yeah. (laughs)

KRAUS:	Yeah?

REVULURI:	There was definitely a period of being really overwhelmed, not just by, like, there’s so many classes and I don’t know which ones to take but, you know, just getting yourself from place to place and meeting all of these people from really different places and backgrounds and their own kind of passions.  So I think I understood what my interests were and they were primarily academic but it was really neat to meet, you know, women who were really passionate about being athletes or artists or, you know, women whose moms went to Smith or grandmothers went to Smith and that was just a different kind of group of people that I just never even quite thought about.

KRAUS:	So what house were you in when you got here?

REVULURI:	I was in King House.

KRAUS:	King House.  So did you stay there all four years?

REVULURI:	I did.  I lived on the third floor of King House all four years.  (laughs)

KRAUS:	Great.  So King, I know now, maybe back then, was mostly singles.

REVULURI:	It’s still all singles.

KRAUS:	Still, yeah.  So how did that change the dynamic of your feeling of house community while you were there?

REVULURI:	You know, when I first got that house assignment in the mail over the summer, I was really upset, because when I’d come to visit, I think I stayed in Duckett and, you know, those women really didn’t like the quad, or, you know, they had all the stereotypes about the quad, and when I got it, I was like, Oh, no, I’m going to live in the quad, I don’t want to be a quad person.  And then I saw that it was a single and I was worried about being lonely or isolated, but actually, because it was all singles, you know, we all had to kind of work a little bit to be social and so the hallways ended up being places that we hung out.  I lived in maid’s quarters my first year; and there’s no maid’s quarters in King anymore, but at that time there was a little hallway that connected those five rooms and we kind of like just spread out into the hallway and that became our little sort of special living area.  So in a way, actually, it made it more social, rather than less.

KRAUS:	Right.  So, I mean, did you know academically what you wanted to do when you got to Smith?

REVULURI:	No, absolutely not.  Or I thought I did, but it didn’t turn out to be right.

KRAUS:	What did you think?

REVULURI:	I wanted to be a government major and go to law school and then maybe run for office, or be a diplomat of some kind, or an ambassador, or something like that.

KRAUS:	And what ended up happening?

REVULURI:	I was a music major and I ended up going to grad school in musicology, got my Ph.D., and now I teach music history.

KRAUS:	Great.

REVULURI:	Yeah. (laughs)

KRAUS:	So definitely a drastic shift, but –

REVULURI:	Yeah. (laughs)

KRAUS:	Yeah, that’s great.  Were you involved in any clubs or orgs on campus?

REVULURI:	Yeah, I was in the Student Government Association.  I was the chair of the Curriculum Committee one year, I was the treasurer one year, so I was on the cabinet two out of my four years.  I was in the Glee Club and the Chamber Singers and I think I was president of one of those at some time.  And I’m sure I did other things I can’t remember now.

(laughter)

KRAUS:	Tell me what was that part of your life outside of academics, what did that mean to you?  I mean, how did that — what role did that play in your time at Smith?

REVULURI:	I mean, it’s funny to think about how much time that took because I do remember my classes and I remember my professors fondly and of course now being a professor myself I think that that’s really important, but I know that those activities were — they were much more a part of my day than any individual class and those are where most of my friends are from.

KRAUS:	So, I mean, at the time — I mean, coming from someone who’s always been overwhelmed with balancing extracurriculars and academics — did you know that it was important for you to be getting out there and experiencing life outside the classroom, life outside your house?

REVULURI:	You know, I don’t think I had any sense that those were separate things, like, that was just part of what college was (laughs), to do all of these things, and taking classes always just seemed like part of that.  I think it’s only looking back on it now that I’m glad I felt so sure enough to do those things and I didn’t feel, you know, shy or overwhelmed, because I think it would have really — it would have had a much — it would have had a negative effect on my experience here.  I think I just wouldn’t have known as many people, or gotten to know so much more about the world through my classmates, so I’m really glad that I just kind of went for it almost without thinking about it.

KRAUS:	Right.  Was that something that was constant in your personality before you got to Smith, or –

REVULURI:	Yeah.

KRAUS:	Or did Smith kind of — yeah.

(laughter)

REVULURI:	I was kind of like that before, too.

KRAUS:	Because I’ve spoken to several people who felt like when they got to Smith they, like, awakened in them this feeling of, I have to go do all this stuff because everything is here, and some people felt like they didn’t take advantage of as much, you know, on campus, but –

REVULURI:	No, I think — I mean, I did student government before, and I was involved in music before and that’s sort of how my interest in music grew.  There were definitely things here that I wish I had known more about sort of early on and really — I wish I’d been a little more mature in my decision making instead of just doing the things I already knew how to do, but actually trying new things.  I think I only did that in little spurts and never sort of committed to doing a new thing for a semester or a year and sometimes I wish I’d done that, but I also feel like I had friends who did a lot of different things and I had a bunch of friends on the fencing team and I used to go cheer them on, I learned a lot about fencing.  I had friends on the Ultimate Frisbee team, and same thing, I don’t think I would have ever really wanted to pursue that myself but I feel like I learned a lot about it through them.

KRAUS:	Great.  I play Ultimate Frisbee so I’m glad you supported them.

REVULURI:	Oh, good.

(laughter)

KRAUS:	So, I mean, how — can you talk maybe a little bit about the campus atmosphere.  I mean obviously people are doing all kinds of things at Smith, and did you feel like Smith was a generally open community, a supportive community, somewhere you can voice any and all opinions or beliefs, or was there any kind of constraint?

REVULURI:	So there was actually — I’m not sure if it was an incident, but there was definitely some kind of tension I think during my first year that there were students who had conservative political beliefs who felt like they couldn’t voice them and somebody wrote an editorial to the Sophian, I think, about it saying, you know, this isn’t really a diverse or open community if we’re not having voices from all over the spectrum.  And there was a forum in one of the house dining rooms about it and then, you know, it kind of petered out at some point, but it was an interesting thing to have happen during my first year, when I also thought myself like I’m so open minded, you know, and then you’re sort of faced with all these different kinds of people and maybe things about them make you confused or uncomfortable and you start to realize that maybe you’re not as open minded, or maybe you’re just not as well educated or maybe there are things you’re ignorant about.  And so it was interesting to have it come from that perspective where, you know, Smith is not necessarily a place, any more at least, known for, you know, really conservative political beliefs and having a group of people who felt like they really couldn’t speak out, make a big deal about that.  I think it helped that there was a kind of hoopla about it.  I think people were more conscious about it afterwards.  I remember, like, I knew the person who was president of Smith College Republican Club and stuff like that, but — but I think there were a lot of things that we took for granted that we just assumed that people felt the same way we did and I don’t know if that was the people I hung out with or that we were 20 years old or what, but, you know, we didn’t know that everybody agreed with us all the time.  One of the things that’s been really interesting is the people I’m still friends with, to see sort of how their political beliefs have grown and changed in both directions, like people who were kind of conservative when they were here have sort of moved towards being a little liberal, or people who were, like, almost radical when they were here and how they’ve moved toward being quite a bit more conservative, and it’s actually, you know, even if I don’t always agree with them, it’s sort of nice to see how fluid that process is.

KRAUS:	Right, absolutely.  So, I just interviewed your partner, Nina —

REVULURI:	Yeah.

KRAUS:	So can you talk a little bit about your relationship while you were here or how that — you know, what role that played in your time at Smith or anything like that.

REVULURI:	Yeah.  So, Nina started out in the Class of ’02 and I was the Class of 2000, so I’d already had, like, my first two years here before I even met her.  So I met her the beginning of my junior year, her first day on campus, I think, and she was also in Chamber Singers and we had a couple classes together, and so we became friends over that year, and we didn’t start dating until the December of my senior year, so I can’t say it had a huge effect on my whole Smith experience, but I do think it took me that long to be able to feel comfortable with — not just dating a woman, but being really open about it to my friends anyway.  I didn’t come out to my parents until almost a year and a half after, maybe even longer, after we’d been dating, so I think I wasn’t sort of actively questioning in the time I was at Smith and I kind of wish I had been more actively questioning.  I think I would have developed a more sort of — a more profound vocabulary for talking about things, which I didn’t have when I left.  I had her, which was pretty great, but I didn’t have a sense of how to communicate that to my family or to other people in the world.  And so while I was here, I was comfortable and I was really happy and then when I left I think I was really terrified, and it took — it took awhile to feel comfortable about the relationship outside of the kind of Smith bubble, and then also to learn how to talk about it without being scared or defensive.

KRAUS:	Right.  And, I mean, do you think that there’s a shift at all in your own relationship just because you both were kind of dealing with this larger context to put your relationship in, was there any difficulty in that?

REVULURI:	I think we took a lot of strength from each other.  But it was definitely hard.  I mean, those years after college are really hard anyway.  She was trying to be a singer, and I was a graduate student, and we didn’t have any money, and we didn’t live in the same place, and there was nothing secure about either of our futures.  And so this was just like one more thing.

(laughter)

REVULURI:	So it was really important for us to be able to talk about it with each other and take a lot of strength from each other, especially as we were dealing with our families, and sometimes I wonder if we hadn’t had such a difficult beginning, if we wouldn’t have really, like, put so much work into our relationship.  I think it’s easy in those years after college to just kind of have a good time, and, you know, not — just not invest a lot in it, and we kind of had to, and I’m really glad, because I think it made us really solid, because it’s been more than ten years now that we’ve been together.

KRAUS:	Right.  That’s wonderful.  So, was that at all difficult with Nina still being at school after you graduated even if it was only for a short amount of time?

REVULURI:	Yeah, it was weird, I mean (laughs), I would drive back from graduate school to visit her here and, like, stay in her dorm room and eat in Parsons House Dining Room, and hang out with her friends, and, you know, I think I certainly associated with a group of people with whom there was, like, a stigma to hanging around Northampton after you graduate, so that always felt a little bit strange.  She also accelerated by a year, so it wasn’t that long that we were doing that.  So even though I felt weird about it, at the same time it was kind of this haven because I was actually in another institution that felt nothing like Smith, I was at Princeton, which, you know, it wasn’t a small liberal arts school, it wasn’t all women.  I was a graduate student which was like a concept that didn’t actually make sense to me until several years into the process (laughs) and I think I was trying to navigate what that place was like relative to my own college experience, so sometimes it was nice to just come back here and feel safe.  And, you know, I knew my way around, I knew my professors, I knew the librarians, that kind of thing.  So there was always this kind of like weird should I be the one to come visit or should you just here?  (laughs)

KRAUS:	Right.  So, I mean, it seems like there’s a really difficult transition period leaving Smith.  Being, you know, in a homosexual relationship, being faced with the world that isn’t Smith, that is actually is so far from Smith sometimes, so, I mean, years later, has it — have you been able to — I mean, what has your role as an alum been, like how do you view the way that Smith handles, you know, making everyone feel accepted, making everyone feel supported, is it — do you think it’s a good thing that Smith has such a strong support system, that maybe it doesn’t prepare you for the real world but it’s a good time while it’s going on?

REVULURI:	I’ve thought about this a lot, actually, so I don’t know if I have an answer but I can share with you what I’ve been thinking about it.  I think it was really important for me to feel safe while I was here in whatever way, so, about coming out, or about being a person of color, or, you know, choosing a different major than I had thought I was going to and pursuing something that, had I known, was, like, actually kind of risky, I’m not sure I would have done it, but it just seemed like in the pursuit of, you know, curiosity, and I would never take any of that back.  At the same time, I do feel like there were ways that we could have been better prepared, and I see some of them now, even just ten years later.  Like, little things, like the — well, it’s not little, actually — but like the Financial Independence Seminar, I don’t really know what it is, but, but that kind of genre of thing where it’s sort of a reminder that this is a temporary home and that you will have to leave and move on and function in the world, but it’s not sort of — it’s not done in this, like, tough love kind of way, you know, it’s just part of an education of a global citizen, which Smith seems really committed to, and I think there are ways to prepare people for other aspects of their life that’s beyond that –m what seems like a practical detail — you know, learning how to manage your finances seems like, you can’t really argue with that being important, right?  But I do think that there are other parts of it that, you know, I had no idea how to come out to my parents, and that seemed weird coming from Smith where, frankly, there are a lot of people who probably need to think about that.  And actually, it was strange, when I went to Princeton, they had an amazing LGBT Center, which I had not anticipated, and it’s almost — it’s actually, I think, almost because they were sort of shamed into having something like that, but the person who runs it really built it up and they have a lot of really wonderful resources.  They cater to a smaller group of students than they probably would here, but — but that doesn’t, I mean, it’s still really well done.  So, I think there are ways that that safe environment could still acknowledge that there’s a world beyond, that may not be the same and that there are ways to carry the strength you find in this safe place out into that world.

KRAUS:	Right.  So, I mean, what does it mean for you to be back here this weekend, seeing your friends, kind of seeing where everyone’s at?  After ten years, you know, what do you — what have you taken kind of into the real world, so to say, from Smith and your experiences here?

REVULURI:	Well, you know, it’s funny is like — you see these people after ten years, especially the ones you haven’t seen, and they’re still strong and spunky and creative and passionate and I love that about seeing them again, and you know, people that I never kept in touch with and they’re not necessarily people who I’m close to, but they’re definitely part of my experience here.  And it’s so great to see that that’s not something I imagine, you know, that that’s actually what it was like, and they’re still like that in all their own different funny ways.  So that’s been really neat, because I have come back to campus multiple times but it’s never the same as when you have those same faces around you.

KRAUS:	Right, definitely.  So, were you had ever — did you ever have any doubts or overwhelming fears about your time at Smith was over, a point when you were, like, this is not for me, you know, that I — did you ever think of transferring?  Did you ever think that maybe it wasn’t what you thought it might be?

REVULURI:	I definitely had sort of difficult periods here, but it was never with the idea that I might go somewhere else.   And I’m glad I never did go somewhere else.  I don’t think that any of the sort of transformations I went through while I was here had anything to do with any deficiencies of Smith as an institution.  I think they were just growing pains of being in college.  So I did — I did have friends who applied to transfer and then would stay, and I think knowing that I never even went through that process.

KRAUS:	Did you go abroad at all?

REVULURI:	I went abroad in the summer between my sophomore and junior year.  The — there was an alum from the Class of ’65, I think, who — maybe ’63 — who had given quite a bit of money to the music department to establish this fund for music and she gave it sort of in the fall or spring of my sophomore year and so I was one of the first students to be able to take advantage of this.  We had to apply with some kind of project that we wanted to do, and they would pick — I think they picked four students, so, I went to a rural farming village in Ghana and learned traditional – (unclear) of drumming.  I was there for eight or ten weeks, and I did that because I knew I wasn’t going to go abroad during my junior year and it was really important, I think, for me to have that kind of experience, even if it was over a summer.  There’s a kind of culture of people who stay junior year, which you’ll see next year, or maybe you’re going abroad, but — which is actually, like, you know, everybody talks about JYA all the time, but very few people talk about what it’s like if you’re still here as a junior, because probably a lot of your friends are gone, and it doesn’t quite feel the same, and the — all the extracurricular activities you do, they’re like, you know, no juniors doing them with you, stuff like that (laughs), but I’m really glad that I stayed because it gave me the chance to — to take certain classes that I otherwise wouldn’t have been able to take, and I was also the Assistant Conductor of the Chorale that year, and the college choir, which may have different names now, but the sort of first-year choir, that — and I couldn’t have done that, obviously, if I had been gone.

KRAUS:	That’s great.  I mean, have any of your outside experiences kind of enhanced your memories of Smith, or made you realize, maybe if you hadn’t already, that your time at Smith was so special, I mean, being at Princeton or being abroad?  Were you more grateful for your time at Smith, or were you –

REVULURI:	Oh, absolutely, yeah.  I think it took about two graduate seminars at Princeton to realize how glad I was that I had gone to Smith.  There was one other woman in my cohort who had gone to a small liberal arts school, but not a women’s college, and I could really see a difference.  I mean, that could just be her, as a person, but I could really see a difference in the way we approached our thinking about seminar discussions, and I think that — that was in large part because I’d had a lot of really positive experiences in that format being here.

KRAUS:	So I guess we will wrap up, we’re almost out of time –

REVULURI:	Okay.

KRAUS:	But, so I mean, do you have any advice for current Smithies or future Smithies about any aspect of life here, and life after?

REVULURI:	Taking to really savor it, it is a really extraordinary place and I think sometimes it’s easy to just get wrapped up in it, or forget, and to really value the people who are around you whether it’s your friends, or your professors, or your coach, or your conductor, or whatever it is, because they work really hard (laughs).  All the people who work here, work really hard, and I don’t think I realized they were what made it so amazing; it wasn’t just the students, it was also all these other people who were invested in the college, but yeah, to really enjoy it and savor it, that would be my advice.

KRAUS:	Great. Well, thank you so much.

REVULURI:	Thank you.

KRAUS:	That was terrific.  I will grab your mic from your –
