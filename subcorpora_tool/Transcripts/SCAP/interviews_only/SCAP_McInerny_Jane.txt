CLERK:	I’m Celeste Clerk interviewing Jane McErny [sic].

MCINERNY:	Close enough.

CLERK:	I’m sorry.  Class of ’78 for the Smith College archives.  Hi.

MCINERNY:	Hi.

CLERK:	We’ll start with a general question.  Where are you from?

MCINERNY:	I’m originally from outside the Washington metropolitan area in D.C.  I grew up in Bethesda, Maryland.

CLERK:	How did you come to Smith College?

MCINERNY:	I have a sister who’s four years older than I am and her goal in life was to go to the best school that she could.  She was very motivated, had everything together, and she did her research and was on the cusp where Ivy League schools were going coed, so she knew she wasn’t going to get into an Ivy League school.  She knew Seven Sisters was the next best thing.  She looked at all the Seven Sisters and chose Smith.  Four years later when I was looking at colleges I was a very different kind of person.  I was not very motivated, but I did get good grades.  And Ann, as my sister, said, “Come to Smith, come to Smith, you’ll love it.”  And we weren’t really particularly close and we’re very different, but I came up for a mixer weekend — I don’t know if they do those anymore — and there was a lot of partying, which was good in my book, and I found out that if you applied early decision you only had to fill in one application, and I was sold so I applied early decision and I got in.  So, not a typical Smith story.

CLERK:	What did it mean to you that Smith was an all-women’s college?

MCINERNY:	At the time that I applied, nothing.  And I remember saying to my roommate my freshman year very early on that one of my biggest terrors was that my roommate was going to be gay.  And that would, you know, be horrific.  And actually both of us have now come out as lesbian.  So in the long term it was very helpful for me with regard to realizing that aspect of my sexuality, but much more importantly, at the end of four years, I’d say the confidence it gave me to function in society as a female is second to none.  But I didn’t choose Smith knowing that it would do that for me.

CLERK:	What did you study?

MCINERNY:	At that time there were, I think, four different specializations in biology and I did environmental biology.

CLERK:	Why did you come to the reunion?

MCINERNY:	I came — this is not my year.  Next year will be my 40th year, but a woman that I got involved with my junior year of college and I have stayed friends, and very dear friends at this point, and she has always come with me to mine because we know a lot more people in my class.  And I have M.S. and became wheelchair bound in ’95 and at that time I was never going to come to Smith again, you know.  And a couple of times ago Amy — I just explained my relationship with her — said, “This is ridiculous, you’re coming” and I came and the campus has done a lot for — to become accessible and it was really a wonderful experience.  So now I come to Amy’s and she comes to mine.  So I’ll be back next year, God is willing.

CLERK:	How would you say the campus is different now?

MCINERNY:	Well, one of the houses that I lived in for a year is gone, Little Hop, Little Hopkins.  And the first house I lived in was Hubbard which bordered Green Street and to me Green Street marked the end of the campus with the exception of the performing arts thing.  So today, to go past that and realize how much all the stuff related, I guess, mostly to engineering and I think there’s also a health and wellness program over there.  So it’s expanded.  But it doesn’t really give you the feeling that it’s gotten bigger.  It’s just expanded in a tasteful way.  I really don’t like the new student center as compared to Davis.  I just don’t care for it.  And I spent a lot of time at Davis when I was here.  Those are the big changes, I guess.

CLERK:	What was your favorite Smith tradition?

MCINERNY:	Thursdays — Smitty nights.  Thursdays was Smitty nights.  You’d get two-for-one beer over at Davis.  And so I would go to — I’d study at the Science Center until like 10:00, go up to Davis, a good friend of mine was behind the bar so we usually only paid for about one out of every other beer we had.  And then to make sure that I stayed on track I scheduled a squash game with someone who was very serious about everything in life and she would never have been caught at Smitty’s, I had a squash game with her at 8:00 in the morning the next morning so that even if I was hungover or whatever I still had to get my ass there and play.  So it kept me in shape, you know.  I was paying my penance for the night before.

CLERK:	Who is the typical Smith student in your time at Smith?

MCINERNY:	I’m sorry, I didn’t understand that?

CLERK:	Who is the typical Smith student of your time at Smith?

MCINERNY:	I think that there — that’s impossible to answer.  And there were different people that fit into — I don’t know if you’re familiar with the show Freaks and Geeks, but everyone had certain pods and you could cross pods a little bit.  My sister, I feel, my sister and I are exactly opposite yet both of us love our experience at Smith.  And to me I thought she presented what Smith was in terms of you go to a boarding school and then you come here and then you marry a man from one of the brother schools and then you have a bunch of kids and that kind of thing.  And that was one typical.  And then as I was realizing my sexuality there were a lot of people that were starting to come into feeling comfortable.  We never felt comfortable saying we were gay, but we all kind of knew about each other and we palled around and partied together.

CLERK:	Did you study abroad?

MCINERNY:	No.

CLERK:	Did you have a favorite professor?

MCINERNY:	I thought about that when someone asked that question at a panel earlier today.  And there were two that I liked a lot, my advisor, Stephen Tilley, in environmental biology, and then there was a general chemistry professor, Chuck Loven who I believe passed away from cancer.  But he had the ability to teach a very dry subject in a way in which I could completely understand it.

CLERK:	What do you remember about Smith administration at the time?

MCINERNY:	It was not very supportive of lesbians.  And yet we sort of thrived here underground.  That’s really all I remember about it.  I have to say, I was saying that I lived in Parsons Annex when it became — the first year it became a co-op like Tenney House.  And I found Tenney House because that’s where you could be more yourself.  You didn’t have to — they make their own meals, they order — much more self-determining.  And it was a much more reasonable lifestyle, I thought, for me, for me to be able to be who I was, even though I wasn’t sure who I was.  And the people in Tenney said, “There isn’t this kind of housing for people who need this housing.”  So they became very active to get Parsons Annex added on and I lived there for a year.  You know, if that didn’t work out usually the next step was to live off campus because you just didn’t — but that worked out OK.  What was the question?

CLERK:	What do you remember about Smith administration at the time?

MCINERNY:	Right, and they fought with the administration to get this done, but eventually the administration did relent to that, which I think they deserve credit for.

CLERK:	President Jill Kerr Conway was the first female president.  What was the administrative shift like?

MCINERNY:	You mean from Mendenhall to Conway?

CLERK:	Yes.

MCINERNY:	Well, it’s very interesting.  Again, this comes back — my sister had a very close relationship with Thomas Mendenhall.  Like she had breakfast at his house, she rowed — they’d go out rowing together and stuff.  And so when I came up I got a note from him saying, “Your sister was really great, you should” — and so I showed up for breakfast there.  That wasn’t my world.  And it was sort of enough exposure to him that I really don’t know what his administration was, but because of his relationship with my sister I feel he was very paternal, and not in an offensive way.  When Conway came, again, I don’t know if it was a change that I sensed in the administration or a change that I sensed because of me, but women were just — it was the first time everything was taken seriously, but there was a sense of humor available as well.  And you know, the women that were able to take her course did nothing but rave about it.

CLERK:	Can you tell me a bit about your social life at Smith?

MCINERNY:	I guess I’ve sort of alluded to it a little bit.  I got in with a bunch of very intense science jocks and it was de rigueur to show up at the science center and study and I studied in the same room every time.  And so everyone knew where everyone else was studying so — and there was a little area where you could drink coffee so you’d go to the connector for a break and you’d see the same people.  And then at 11:00 — if we didn’t get out of there by 11:00ish we would order from Bernier’s or Colonial Liquor.  They would deliver and you could drink when you were eighteen, so we’d be having some beer down there or we’d go up to Smitty’s.
And then when I got together with my girlfriend Amy we started to find out about the Pink or the Gala — it’s the same bar — that was in downtown Northampton that was owned by an Eastern European couple, much older man and woman.  Jeannie was her name, I don’t remember his name, but in the front there was a bunch of old men who the guy would serve and then in the back there was a jukebox and three or four tables and you could dance.  And it was all the lesbians in Northampton and Smith came down to dance so they could be together.

CLERK:	How did you date at Smith?

MCINERNY:	(laughs) How did I date at Smith?

CLERK:	Did you go to any mixers?

MCINERNY:	My freshman year I kind of tried that stuff, but not so much.  Sophomore year I just really wasn’t interested in anything and then I had a friend in Harvard, I went to visit him.  I didn’t really — I dated one guy.  I just wasn’t that interested and so — and then when I found the weekend instead sort of studying and then drinking with the girls, that’s what I did until I became very close to this person and all of a sudden — well, not all of a sudden, but then realized that I wanted to have a physical relationship with her.  And then she’s the only woman that I was with here.  So that’s how I dated.

CLERK:	Who was your best friend?

MCINERNY:	Well, Amy is my best friend now and I also — my freshman year roommate, Gail White, she went away junior year and then when she came back she and I lived in a suite together.  And she and I are still good friends too.  So those would be the two.

CLERK:	What did you guys do?

MCINERNY:	Gail was into science as well so we sort of did that stuff together.  Amy and I, I mean we sort of figured out being gay together.  I smoked a lot of pot.  I liked that.  We went to parties.  We also figured out how to have dance parties where there were all women.  And so you’d find out where those were and you’d go and dance.  And I — and then you’d try to figure by who was there who was together kind of thing.  But by the end of Amy’s senior year people knew we were together because I was bereft at the thought of her leaving.  And we had lived together in Northampton the summer after — we lived two summers, the summer after my junior and senior year.

CLERK:	Did you play any sports?

MCINERNY:	Yes.  I played soccer all four years.  I played basketball I think two years.  I played softball three years and I played JV [Junior Varsity] lacrosse one year.  And that was my senior year, I was tired of softball.  And I went to some game — I think I went to Union [College] and I finished the JV game and something happened to the catcher for the softball team so I suited up and played for that.  So that day I played both lacrosse and softball.  And then they wrote about it in the Smith Sophian.

CLERK:	What do you remember about the political climate at Smith College?

MCINERNY:	Complete blank.

CLERK:	Do you remember maybe what students were saying about Vietnam on campus?

MCINERNY:	I feel like Vietnam was pretty much kind of over when I was there.  The biggest thing sort of politically was the Billie Jean King beating Bobby Riggs, but that happened before I came.  And to me, you know, the political is personal and for me personal was sexuality and gender.  So that’s what I talked with about my friends who were willing to talk about it. Sexism or feminism/sexism, that actually was pretty — discussed pretty openly and pretty aggressively.  Women were trying to figure out what we were going to do with our lives and our careers.

CLERK:	Can you say a little bit more about that?

MCINERNY:	I think that — there were these women who knew — somehow I felt that they were smarter and more talented than I in that they knew when they came to Smith where they were going and what they were going to do.  And I envied them.  I thought that was great.  I had really no idea what I was going to do.  And after Smith a bunch of us ended up kind of going to Boston and all of those people subsequently, ones in public health, there’s two doctors, what else?  Amy is a journalist.  But for the first — so my theory is that we all spent about three to five years figuring how to come out and how to deal with this sexuality in our personal lives because we didn’t think that the two could mix, that you could do both.  And so, and we also didn’t really talk to each other about how we were doing.  We watched other of our friends do it and then figure — you’d learn by example.  So did that answer your question?

MCINERNY:	You mentioned before that the administration was not very friendly to lesbians.

MCINERNY:	Ugh.

CLERK:	What did you mean by that?

MCINERNY:	There were certainly stories and people that we knew who, they had gotten together and had been discovered by the administration, the administration had kicked them out.  And our dean at the time, you know, the two — the top summa cum laude scholars in my class were lovers and we all watched Dean Russell have to announce that, knowing that she knew about them, thinking that it really frosted her ass, excuse my language.  And it was sort of like we really felt that we had proved some point.  And a lot of that is sort of the age that we were at, that, we were kind of snotty little kids, but we also felt that we still had a point to prove.

CLERK:	What were students saying about civil rights on campus?

MCINERNY:	It was one of those kind of discussions that when it happened I just didn’t really participate in.  I wasn’t that — I didn’t have a lot of African-American friends, I didn’t have a lot of friends of color.  Not because I chose to or not to, that just — my sister who’s four years ahead of me felt it was a much more unstable environment that she was in.  I don’t have that experience.  But again, it’s sort of a blindness, a vision, probably by choice, that I wouldn’t be too proud of if I did it today.

CLERK:	Reflecting back on Smith, what do you think of your time here now?

MCINERNY:	I walked around the — or I rode around the campus today and the places that I went and stuff and I thought — and my parents both died a long time ago, but I thought to myself, They did one of the best things for me that I ever could have done.  This was the best thing that ever happened to me in my life.  So for me my time at Smith — the first two years were hard and challenging, the last two years were just sublime.

CLERK:	Who have you become?

MCINERNY:	I’m sorry?

CLERK:	Who have you become?

MCINERNY:	(sigh) I’ve become an old woman.  I’ve become someone who has been able to withstand — I mean the big issue for me now is my disability.  And I also credit Smith with my ability to survive that and to still — I mean I still work part-time.  And the stuff that I do — I just don’t feel like I have to apologize and it was much, much harder — with M.S. it’s a progressive condition and I had it for many years before I was in a wheelchair and I once wrote a piece about it and saying that I would tell someone that I was gay way before I’d tell them I had M.S.  I was so much more ashamed of that than I was about being gay.  And so that when I had to deal with not being able to hide my disability the model — what I had learned from being female in this society and being gay in this society, what I had learned at Smith to shore me up also applied very handily to my experience as a person — as another minority with a disability.  So I’m not sure if that answered your question.

CLERK:	Thank you.

MCINERNY:	You’re welcome.

GEIS:	I just have some follow-up questions.  So I have a good friend who has M.S. and she’s recently in a wheelchair.

MCINERNY:	I’m sorry?

GEIS:	I have a friend who’s had M.S. most of her life and she’s recently in a wheelchair as well.  And if you could describe for us what’s the difficulty of being able to talk about that for someone to help understand?  What have you learned about yourself now?  I mean you said it really well now just now about what you learned at Smith and it sounds like the tools that you got here have helped you.  So what strength do you have?

MCINERNY:	Smith taught me basic survival and I learned that in different challenges in my life.  I went back to medical school.  Let me see, I graduated, I was 21, and I didn’t start medical school till like 29.  And the challenges that I saw other people in my class, particularly women, especially crises of confidence, I didn’t have.  And I feel that Smith is clearly responsible for that.  It’s so hard to talk about, you know, like how hard it was to be a lesbian at that time.  Because it’s like people who are coming out now have no idea.  It was a culture that had its own rules and you had to figure them out and there was no one you could talk to about it.  It’s just — and there’s some component of that now, but not the way it was then.  And I had a supportive cohort that I found that we all sort of came out together.  I saw a thing about the Alison Bechdel book.  I lived in a collective with six lesbians too.  You know, I know that.  And we all helped each other.
When I realized — or, when I got diagnosed with M.S. denial worked for me for a very, very long time.  And then I had two really important things happen to me.  One was I went to a workshop for people with M.S. and a woman who was on the volunteer side was working with me about something and it turned out that she has MS and she was a physician.  And I said something and her response to me was, But you’ll always be a doctor.  And it’s the core that you’re still going to be who you’ve been regardless of — and I remember when I first realized that I might have lesbian feelings, I said that to — someone told me they had lesbian feelings and I told that to a friend of mine and she said, “Well, do you still like her?”  And I said, “Most definitely.”  And she said, “What’s the big deal?”  So I took that to the disability and as much as this society doesn’t like gays, they really don’t like disabled people.  We are fucking inconvenient for you.  And the longer that you cannot feel apologetic about that the longer you’ll survive in abled society.  Does that answer your question?

CLERK:	Absolutely.

MCINERNY:	And you have to have a sense of humor.

CLERK:	Yes.

MCINERNY:	You know, lesbians, feminists, and disabled people don’t have senses of humor.  You have to.  It’s the only way you’ll get through.

CLERK:	Thank you very much.

MCINERNY:	Oh, you’re welcome.
