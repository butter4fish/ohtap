Reid Soskin. This is Julie Stein and Javier Arbona. And this is tape one. Thank
you so much for sitting down with us again. We have some semi-general questions
when we were reading through your first transcript and wanted both to get your
take on what you think, of the historic record, needs to be fixed and then some
other questions that we were curious about. So I know that you have done some
more research into your early life, about the timing of your family&#039;s move.

SOSKIN: Yes.

STEIN: I&#039;m curious about the revisions or what your research has done that you&#039;d
like to fix the record on.

SOSKIN: I noticed, first off, that I gave my age in coming to California as age
four. And I had never had occasion to try to refine that before in my life. No
one has taken an oral history. And that time was always kind of foggy for me. I
didn&#039;t know why that was. But since then, I&#039;ve discovered very, very factually,
that the age I came in was six. I remember, for instance, entering first grade
in California. I remembered the actual storm, the hurricane in 1927. I
remembered that that was a reason that we came to California. And at some point,
I read that that 1927, which put the age up two years. And then when I
remembered, really, the trauma. I&#039;m, for instance, phobic about lightning and
thunder. I&#039;ve never understood why. I&#039;ve never had any reason to understand. But
I remember my grandmother telling me to jump into bed at the first sound of
thunder because had I ever heard of anyone being struck by lightning in bed? And
all the way into my adulthood, I would jump into bed the minute thunder rolled.
So I began to connect that storm, that hurricane, with my entry into California.
And gradually, after that first interview and that four-year-old--I began to
realize why I would have buried that time, because it was so traumatic. It
completely uprooted and changed my life. I was a child in New Orleans; then
suddenly I was in my grandfather&#039;s home in California. And it also seemed to
have been connected to the fact that I was born into a strongly Catholic family.
Completely rooted to the church. My grandfather lay in state for three days
after his death, because the church we grew up in was Corpus Christi, which is
the church he had built. He was an architect and engineer. That storm happened
on Good Friday. So the symbolism, the religious symbolism, also would&#039;ve been traumatic.

So I began to understand after that first oral history, why that period was
cloudy for me. And I began to make connections. I completely was out of the
Catholic faith by the time I was a teenager. I&#039;ve never really tried to figure
out how that period figures into my becoming an atheist. But the fact that Good
Friday figured into it seems to be symbolic. So there&#039;ve been all these openings
that have occurred since that time. And I think that&#039;s probably why
memory--memory is so layered that I think that we often begin to find out much,
much, much later incidents, how they figure in the overall.

STEIN: Did you have a sense of whether the hurricane happening on Good Friday
affected the faith of other members of your family?

SOSKIN: No. There was never any indication that I--and I never discussed it. So
the truth is that I&#039;m not really sure what the answer to that is. My father
remained a Catholic, and he was an official in the St. Vincent de Paul at St.
Benedict&#039;s Church. My dad died a Catholic. My mother died a Catholic, but a
cafeteria Catholic. My mother was practicing birth control--she only had three
children--so that she could not accept the sacraments.

STEIN: Do you know what that meant at that time? Were diaphragms available?

SOSKIN: No.

STEIN: So what did--?

SOSKIN: No. My mother had to choose between abstinence, I think, and her
religion. And I think my mother chose her sexuality. And then it was
interesting. When I was beginning to outgrow my faith, I didn&#039;t discuss that
with my parents because they would never have understood. Catholicism was a
Charbonnet--it was in the DNA. So that that didn&#039;t become an issue for me until
I adopted my first child from Catholic Charities. And when that happened, I had
to promise his birth mother that he would be raised a Catholic. And I then began
to explore my Catholicism and why I had dropped away, because I needed to follow
the dictates of that agreement with the Catholic Social Service.

I went back to church and got a conversation with a priest, asked for an
appointment. Because I told him I had this child, adopted at nine days old; he
was my first child; that I really wanted to honor his mother&#039;s wishes; but that
I had some questions, and could he answer them, maybe, and help me to understand
so that I could do that; that my word was important to me. And he listened to me
and he said, &quot;Mrs. Reid, you are attempting to be intelligent about what is a
faith. And it&#039;s a gift of God and must not be questioned.&quot; And I thought as I
walked out, &quot;He doesn&#039;t know any more than I do.&quot; [they laugh] And I never went back.

I went to my mother--that&#039;s what it was--and I said that I really was trying to
raise Rick the way his mother wished, and that I&#039;d never discussed the fact that
I just wasn&#039;t going to church; but that I also noticed that she wasn&#039;t going to
church, so what was it that--I don&#039;t think that I thought she intellectually
thought her way out of it. But I needed some support. And she said, &quot;You know,
Betty, some things are just not the priests&#039; business.&quot; [they laugh]

STEIN: Sounds like good advice. I&#039;m actually really curious about--some of my
own research has to do with adoption and motherhood and stuff around that. And I
know that one of the aspects of adoption at the time was that they were very
religiously based, or was often religious charities.

SOSKIN: Right. Right.

STEIN: I&#039;m curious. I don&#039;t know if you would mind talking about--

SOSKIN: No.

STEIN: --the process of both finding a Catholic adoption agency, or whether they
were also racially grouped. Because I think today, we do adoption, I think, much
more about skin color and much less about religion; whereas it seems like it
wasn&#039;t always that way.

SOSKIN: My motivation for adopting was so simplistic. My sisters--one was four
years older, one was four years younger--we were spaced so that there wasn&#039;t
much companionship between us. We were never in the same growth periods at the
same time. We were not in the same schools at the same time. My older sister
married at nineteen. My younger sister married at sixteen, I think it was. But
they were both pregnant at the same time, and I was not. And I had fulfilled the
expectations of my parents, and my community, by becoming married. But I was
really supposed to be pregnant by now. And so at a very, very early age, I was
not going to be left behind; I was going to have a baby. What agency would&#039;ve
allowed me, at that age, to become a mother, [laughs] I don&#039;t know. The Catholic
Social Services must&#039;ve been desperate.

STEIN: How old were you? Was it 1945?

SOSKIN: Yeah. Rick was born in 1945. And I was married in 1942. So that I
must&#039;ve been twenty-three or twenty-two. But I should&#039;ve been really questioned
at that point. Now I wonder how anybody would&#039;ve ever done that. Because I just
didn&#039;t want-- I was just fulfilling my destiny as a Catholic woman. [laughs] Or
even as a woman.

STEIN: Were there overt ways that you felt that pressure? People talk about in
that time period, the baby boom and everyone was having children. How did--

SOSKIN: I don&#039;t remember the baby boom. And certainly, that would&#039;ve been--no,
it would&#039;ve probably followed that. That was pretty early for the baby boom
because 1945 is when the war ended.

STEIN: Right.

SOSKIN: And the baby boom would&#039;ve been nine or ten months later.

STEIN: Right. [they laugh]

SOSKIN: So that at the point of pregnancy, that probably wouldn&#039;t have been a
factor. I think the factor really was that particularly as an African-American
woman, there were no models in my family for any alternatives to being--a
successful woman was married by the time she was twenty. If you were twenty-six
and unmarried, you were considered a spinster. A successful woman began her
family in her early twenties. I would have fulfilled the expectations of my
community by being such. So that the pressures would&#039;ve come from the community,
not from the larger world, I don&#039;t think. I think I felt it within my family. My
sisters were both expecting children, and I was not.

STEIN: Was it their first child, both of them?

SOSKIN: Yes. Yes.

STEIN: Was there any stigma to adoption? Or were people just so thrilled that
there was another child in the family?

SOSKIN: It was simply an alternative. I don&#039;t remember it being blessed in any
way by my family or--I would think that my parents probably felt I wasn&#039;t going
to bear children because I had started trying to have a child when I was
married. First night. [they laugh] This is what we do. So that I think that by
the end of three years, if I hadn&#039;t produced a baby, my family would&#039;ve
assumed--as I did--that I was probably barren. And continued to try. It was
another three or four years before I had my first child naturally.

STEIN: It&#039;s really fascinating to talk to someone of this generation, where
having a large family probably wasn&#039;t even really questioned. It was almost
assumed. And then to see how you not only balanced family, but then went on to a
career and to various careers.

SOSKIN: But that was not anticipated. I had my first significant job after the
age of fifty.

STEIN: Which doesn&#039;t follow the traditional, let&#039;s say, feminist narrative of--

SOSKIN: Not only that, there weren&#039;t any models for me. I could not have
envisioned what my life became after my children grew up, how many of the
societal issues I would have lived out. My first child, for instance, was gay.
My last child is developmentally disabled. I had to care for my aging parents
until they died, at ninety-five and 101, respectively. So all the issues of gay
rights, of developmentally disabled, of elder care--all of those things had to
be lived out over these eighty-eight years. And had to be lived out personally.
I had to know what those things were. I think it sparked a life of activism, and
very early. But not as a working woman. I guess I worked in a dress shop in
Walnut Creek at the time when I was anticipating, maybe, a divorce, and needed
to begin to explore how I would take care of myself.

STEIN: And at this point, you had four children, correct?

SOSKIN: Yeah. So career was never anything. In fact, I never even attended
college. I never had a break between belonging to my father, whom I respected,
and belonging to my husband, who was my best friend, who I married, who I met at
the age of thirteen or fourteen. It was a predictable marriage. And I can&#039;t say
that I questioned any of that. It&#039;d be great to say I was a feminist; I didn&#039;t
know what that was. [laughs]

STEIN: Right. Nobody did. [laughs] You can&#039;t blame yourself for that one.

SOSKIN: No. I really, really was living a prescribed kind of life. Until I moved
into Walnut Creek and found that I had to either choose sides racially and
politically or not survive emotionally.

STEIN: Can you talk a little bit more about that transition to Walnut Creek and
some of the--?

SOSKIN: I understand that a lot better since I&#039;m a park ranger.

STEIN: Wonderful. [they laugh] Fantastic.

SOSKIN: Because I&#039;ve had to look at the whole context. Up until I began to work
as a National Park Ranger, I could only look out of Betty&#039;s eyes, this woman who
grew up behind these eyes and how she had personal experiences. When I became a
park ranger and began to look at that entire home front experience, for
instance, I had to make room for the context. That had never been true for me
before. When I moved into Walnut Creek--and even, I guess, in the first oral
history--what I understood was my experience, objectively; the fact that Mel and
I had grown up in California. He was a fourth generation Californian. He had
grown up in a family that had come out here during the Civil War. So had never
grown up--well, certainly, racial bigotry existed; we were aware of it. It was
simply not a problem in our lives. And I&#039;ve learned since that had the civil
rights response and revolution depended on the community that I grew up
in--which was largely Creole, Catholic, out of New Orleans, somewhat
privileged--had it depended on us, the civil rights revolution would&#039;ve been
another thirty years, probably. [they laugh]

Because life was tolerable for us. We knew that that bigotry existed, but we
could find our ways around that. And it was mostly the people who came in from
the South, both black and white, and who had to play that out in the context of
the home front mobilization, that accelerated that social change. They had to
come up with those 747 ships in three years and eight months, with the social
system that was in place then. Henry Kaiser was not a social reformer. He was a
savvy industrialist. And he delivered ships faster than the enemy could sink
them; that was his charge. And he did it with all these thousands of
sharecroppers he brought in, white and black, from the South.

When the war ended--and this is where it gets to the move to Walnut Creek--Mel
and I had been forced, over those four years, to become a part of the migration
population. In part, because we lived and were working in that framework. But
our wishes for our lives were based upon House Beautiful and Sunset Magazine
[they laugh] and Formica countertops and all this stuff, and a house. We had
saved our money. We had gone into business for ourselves, for instance, because
who wanted to work for white folks anymore? We had become, to some extent,
radicalized; but not really. So that we wanted to build a house, and could
afford to when the war ended. And his family, his parents had moved to Danville
and had a little truck farm. They wanted to raise horses and have a garden. And
there weren&#039;t enough people in Danville then to resist anything. So that in
visiting, we would pass through Walnut Creek on the way to have the kids ride on
the horses at Grandpa&#039;s house. And my husband picked out this lot in an
unincorporated area of Walnut Creek, between Lafayette and Walnut Creek. And we
wanted to build a house; we could afford it. We chose an architect to design it
who was a Quaker, so had no problems with designing our house.

STEIN: Was that a conscious decision, do you think, to hire--?

SOSKIN: I don&#039;t know because I wasn&#039;t a part of those discussions. I was
pregnant with David. And my father, who was a contractor, or had done
contracting with his father, was working with Mel. This was man&#039;s work. They
were going to provide for me and the children. And I had Rick and Bob and was
pregnant with David, so there were two children at that time. And so I was not
really involved in those--except that when this lumber began to be stacked and
word began to get out that an African American family was moving into this area,
we began to get threatening letters from the neighborhood.

STEIN: And these were sent to your home in Berkeley?

SOSKIN: I don&#039;t know. Either I don&#039;t remember or I&#039;ve blocked it out. I don&#039;t
know how Mel got those letters. I remember reading them. I remember one being
from the county. And the county had apparently been told that Father Divine, who
was the great black leader at that time, religious leader, had purchased the
property to create a &quot;heaven.&quot; [laughs] And that they wanted us to understand
that this property could not be used for anything other than a private home. We
didn&#039;t know where those rumors were coming from.

What I didn&#039;t know, and what I began to learn as a ranger, was that the thing
that came about with the end of the war was that returning servicemen were using
their GI Bills to begin the suburbs, the suburbanization of the country. Because
the GI Bill was administered locally rather than federally, the local banker
could determine where they would float a mortgage. So that white people would be
coming to the suburbs, but black people could not follow. And the white people
were trying to escape me! [they laugh] And here we are, this young couple with
two children, moving into the midst of the lion&#039;s den. I could not have
understood that context at that time. And I spent the next five, ten years in
kind of awfulness of rejection, of having to sort out where I was in that whole
thing, becoming the object of ridicule and hostility. As I was telling someone,
the very first year, summer vacation--no, it was just before summer vacation,
that my oldest child, who was I think maybe in third or fourth grade, entered
the school, which was Parkmead. One of my neighbors, who was actually the wife
of a psychiatrist who had moved from Berkeley because we were there--they were a
Jewish couple. Marian Powelson came to me and said, &quot;You need to know that
Parkmead PTA and faculty are holding a minstrel show as a fundraiser.&quot;

STEIN: In the 1950s?

SOSKIN: In the 1950s. And I went to the school and the principal&#039;s office. And
there on his door was his end man costume. And that evening, they were going to
be, all of them, in blackface, the teachers and faculty. And I walked in and
said, &quot;You know this is wrong.&quot; And he said, &quot;I didn&#039;t know until I saw your
face. But you need to know, Mrs. Reid, that we&#039;re not really making fun of black
people; we want to show you as happy-go-lucky.&quot; And I said, &quot;Do I look
happy-go-lucky?&quot; [they laugh] And he said, &quot;No.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, you do know
that minstrel shows grew out of ridicule of African Americans.&quot; Blacks; it
wasn&#039;t African Americans then. &quot;And that this is wrong. And how do I explain
this to my son?&quot; And I said, &quot;I know that it&#039;s too late for me to do anything
about this or for you to call off your show, but you&#039;re going to perform it in
front of me.&quot; And I sat in the audience that night, in the front row, and made
them put on the show in front of me. It was that kind of thing that began my
activism. But I always felt that it was wrong and that people were going to
discover it was wrong because basically, people were good. [laughs] How I
maintained that, I do not know. But do you know that the same community that
fought my being there so hard sent me, in 1972, to Miami to represent them as a
McGovern delegate to the Miami convention?

STEIN: So it sounds like you were right. [laughs]

SOSKIN: I don&#039;t know what you do with that. I don&#039;t know what you do with that.

STEIN: Right. You mentioned not having models for an idea of feminism at the
time. Were there models in terms of activism, in terms of anti-racist activism?
It sounds like you fell into it quite naturally.

SOSKIN: I fell into it as a matter of survival. And I almost didn&#039;t survive. I
sort of suffered a mental break when Dorrie was about two and a half, and was in
therapy for about three years. Out of which I sort of redefined myself and
learned to live with my insanity. [they laugh] It&#039;s true. I figured out that all
the things that were bizarre about me were the things that were wonderful. [they laugh]

STEIN: That sounds like an excellent lesson.

SOSKIN: Yeah, I didn&#039;t need to be sane. All the sane people I knew were crazy. [laughs]

STEIN: Well, it sounds like in a lot of ways, you were put in a very crazy
situation, with--

SOSKIN: I was! That&#039;s why I say--I know now that I have never lacked intellect.
I know that all the important things I ever learned, I probably knew when I was
six. I think I out-thought my mother when I was about eight years old. So that I
do have a sense now--I didn&#039;t have the ego to support that until I began to
enter later life, and I began to realize that the only difference between me and
my first husband was that I had a sense of how much there was to know and he
didn&#039;t. And so he thought he knew. [they laugh] And that that was true of most
of the adults in my life, when I was a little kid; that I really was never sure
of anything when I was a child. I was always open to question. And as I aged
into my, oh, maybe seventies, I began to realize that that was probably the root
of much of my confusion; but that ultimately, I was right. That the world
contains so much more than any individual could possibly know. And that it was a
mark of intelligence. That I had a sense, always a sense of the beyond. And that
religion stopped that process. As a kid, I didn&#039;t think my way out of
Catholicism; but somehow, the answer that God made the grass green-- [they laugh]

STEIN: Didn&#039;t fly.

SOSKIN: --failed when I was about five.

STEIN: Well, I want to ask you one other question, but then it sounds like this
will be a good time to talk about the Unitarian Church a little bit.

SOSKIN: Oh, sure!

STEIN: But before we get there--so many questions--did you and your husband
consider not moving? Do you ever recall a moment when it got to be too much?
When the threatening letters or the obvious racism of the school system--?

SOSKIN: No.

STEIN: No.

SOSKIN: And see, I can&#039;t speak for Mel. He died. After we divorced, so that I
don&#039;t know whether he entered that kind of period of summation that I did at
maybe seventy and beyond. He didn&#039;t live long enough to be that; he died in his
sixties. So it&#039;s hard for me not to apply the wisdom acquired in the last ten or
fifteen years to an earlier period in life. I don&#039;t know whether Mel discovered
that. I do know that the pride of being a Charbonnet probably stood me in good
stead, because I had this--someone once told me it was very hard to feel
superior to somebody who refused to be inferior. [they laugh] And I think that
was true. I never believed that I was inferior. Even through all of those times.

There was an attorney who lived just around the bend in Walnut Creek. His name
was Robert Condon; Eleanor Condon was his wife. And that&#039;s C-O-N-D-O-N. She was
a well know ceramicist, and he was a well known liberal radical attorney. He was
a partner of Robert Treuhaft, who was Jessica Mitford&#039;s husband. And they were
both involved with Democratic politics. And when he discovered I was there, they
offered to give a dinner party to introduce us to the neighbors. Because they
were absolutely enchanted with our presence. We were going to become their--no,
that was going to be their champion for the year, because we were their cause.
And I remember saying, &quot;Absolutely not. You will not give a dinner party, which
would suggest that you were giving me permission to move into a house which we
have built and have a perfect right to.&quot; And I missed his anger, because we
never got to be friends with him.

But I got pushed against the wall, or we got pushed against the wall. But what
came out was this feisty, proud Betty that apparently was the birth of this
woman who later became a political activist. At that time, I was fighting for my
right to be there, and feeling perfectly deserving, and wanted to set an example
for my children. It was really, really personal; it was not a part of any
movement. I was not a member of the NAACP or anything. And that was, I think,
the beginning of wanting to stand on my own. I remember saying, &quot;I don&#039;t want
you,&quot; the Condons, &quot;to feel responsible if I don&#039;t mow my lawn. You cannot give
me permission, because you would then define my life as I live it.&quot; And I
remember those conversations, so they must have been pivotal. I can remember the
words and the expressions. And I think that maybe those are the road signs that
trace me back to a deliberate progression toward my political awareness now.

STEIN: Did you maintain social relationships with your friends who were still
living in Berkeley?

SOSKIN: No. We lost not only those connections--our home, because we had a
swimming pool, which was not usual in our family, family members would come out
for picnics. And occasionally, as my kids grew up, cousins would come out. We
had belonged to social clubs, which we&#039;d given up. But it felt natural to me
because all of my friends and family were then creating their nuclear families
and turned into those finding their way. So it didn&#039;t seem to me unusual that we
dropped away. But the other thing that was happening was that my marriage was
falling apart, in that my husband, once the house was built--because he had
physically joined the building of the house, the hammering; my husband and my
father literally, with a couple of laborers, built the house.

STEIN: Wow.

SOSKIN: But once that was done, he turned his attention back to the business.
And I was left pretty much alone in the suburbs. Not unlike my counterparts who
were white suburbanites. This was all pre-Betty Friedan. [they laugh] So we
really were all kind of women together raising children. So it didn&#039;t seem, even
then, unusual for me. I was becoming a typical suburban housewife, with the
addition of being an African American. And when I say it was extreme, Mel would
leave at seven in the morning and come home after midnight sometimes. Most of
the time.

STEIN: Wow.

SOSKIN: And worked throughout the week. And built a very, very successful
business at one point. Successful in a limited kind of way. And was becoming
more and more involved in a world that I wasn&#039;t a part of. And I was becoming a
part of a suburban lifestyle that he wasn&#039;t a part of.

STEIN: When you say becoming a part of it, sometimes historians talk about women
in the suburbs in the fifties as very isolated. And there are other people who
talk about women joining social groups or throwing parties together or
playgroups or--

SOSKIN: I think both those things are true. I think it&#039;s both. I remember
working with women on fashion shows at the country club. I also remember being
socially active. As members of the Unitarian Church, political activism was a
norm. Giving luncheon speeches. I remember being advertised at the local
Presbyterian church, with a sandwich board out in front saying, &quot;Betty Reid,
colored housewife,&quot; [they laugh] to a group of enlightened Presbyterians.

STEIN: Oh, my!

SOSKIN: And I remember my speech with that sign. I said, &quot;You know, it seems to
me that I could be described as an artist,&quot; because at that time, I was doing a
lot of painting and a lot of writing and music, &quot;or I could be described as a
mother, or I could be described as a political activist. But that sign limits
who I am.&quot; And I said, &quot;I find it offensive.&quot; [laughs] And they were not
stirred, but I think I gave voice to a lot of things then. Well, I had nothing
to lose. I didn&#039;t have a feeling of being a part of anything. Except the
Unitarian Church, which really, really was a changing agent in my life.

STEIN: How did you find the Unitarian Church?

SOSKIN: Because long after--maybe several years after--the initial shock of our
being there, and when people who wanted to use me to authenticate their liberal
views found me, I began to build this circle of liberals around me. There was
Helen Scharmer, all these people from the greater valley. I learned of a couple,
a black couple who bought a house in Gregory Gardens, which was a rather
low-cost housing development out in Pleasant Hill, which was just developing.
Median income was--the guy was a truck driver, I think, and his wife was either
a nurse or a nurse&#039;s aide. I didn&#039;t really know them. But there were a series of
stories that began to occur in the local press about these people coming
into--and the problems that the community was having. The fact that the
improvement association was meeting on thus-and-so night to decide on how they
were going to get rid of these people. And blithely I figured that I had
experienced this here; that I was probably the only person in the valley that
knew that you could grow beyond that; and that my community had gone through the
same kind of thing, and that we had come out the other side. And that maybe if I
told that, went to that meeting and explained that you could get beyond this,
that maybe they would. And so I don&#039;t remember how it came to his
attention--maybe through a mutual friend--but David Bortin--that&#039;s
B-O-R-T-I-N--who was an attorney in Walnut Creek, heard that I was planning to
attend the meeting.

STEIN: Was it the improvement association?

SOSKIN: This was the improvement association.

STEIN: Okay, so you were going to go right up against--

SOSKIN: Yeah!

STEIN: --your adversaries.

SOSKIN: They were just people. And I knew that you could get beyond that. And so
why not?

STEIN: Absolutely.

SOSKIN: And so David called me and said, &quot;Do you realize that this is really
emotionally dangerous?&quot; He introduced himself and said, &quot;I understand that you
plan to go out and--people can really be cruel.&quot; I said, yes, I knew. I had
suffered through that, and I knew that people could get beyond that; and that
that couple had bought their house and they deserved to live in it; and that I
knew that that could happen. And I said I was going to go. And he said, &quot;Well,
okay, if you insist. I will be in the room. So just be--.&quot; And I did. I dressed
my very, very nicest, very conservatively, all beiges and browns [they laugh]
from I. Magnin&#039;s, and drove in my wood-paneled station wagon. All the
stereotypes of suburban living, right?

STEIN: Right.

SOSKIN: I drive out into the grammar school building in Pleasant Hill and jumped
out of my car and walked into the room. And it was filled. And I sit on the end,
about in the middle. And unfortunately, no one recognized me as being African
American. I had told David that my color was going to protect me, because the
people don&#039;t say those things when there&#039;s a person of color present, and that I
knew that was going to protect me. And when I walked in the room, they didn&#039;t
recognize that I was a person of color. And the meeting went on as if I weren&#039;t
there. And I heard things I had never heard before. At the point where someone
said, &quot;If we fail to get them out under any other basis, we can use the Health
Department, on the basis of the filthy diseases they bring in.&quot; At which point,
I got up and went to the front of the room and said, &quot;I really am feeling like
I&#039;m eavesdropping. I need you to know that I&#039;m one of the undesirables,&quot; because
they kept saying undesirables. They didn&#039;t say niggers, they said undesirables.
I said, &quot;I&#039;m one of the undesirable people that you&#039;re referring to. And I want
you to know that.&quot;

And then I went into my little speech. Maybe took the floor to a stunned
audience of about ten or fifteen minutes, and then panicked and ran out of the
room into the dark, because it had become dark. When I walked into the building,
it was daylight. Ran out of the building, hearing footsteps behind me as I ran
out. And I didn&#039;t know whether I was being chased--. Now, all the warnings of
David Bortin began to surface, that I was in a dangerous situation. But by the
time I reached my car, a man came up and tapped me on the shoulder, identified
himself in the dark as a reporter, and wanted to know my name. Said that he had
to get back in there to see what happened as a result of my talk, but that he
wanted my number because he would call me as soon as the meeting was over, when
he got back to his office. And then the next person who came up--and by now, I&#039;m
getting into my car, panicked--is David Bortin. And he said, &quot;Betty, I&#039;m here.&quot;
He said, &quot;Go home and I&#039;ll call you.&quot;

I went into my house and I&#039;m trembling. It was the scariest thing I think I have
ever done. I didn&#039;t know what had happened. But the reporter did call. And he
said, &quot;Those sounds you heard as you were coming out of foot--.&quot; He said, &quot;What
they did was that they decided--.&quot; Someone got up and said that he had gone to
high school with me and that he didn&#039;t know what had happened to me, but that
the Communists use people like this to spread their message. And completely just
tore me up. He said, &quot;But the people who came out behind you left the meeting
when you did.&quot; He said, &quot;I don&#039;t think that the improvement association will
ever meet again.&quot; And they didn&#039;t. But I didn&#039;t know that most of those
people--and this reinforced my sense that people are good--most of the people
apparently were in there out of curiosity. They were not there because they
wanted those people out. What I reinforced was their conviction that this was
something that needed to be done. So ultimately, that reinforced my sense that
we can get beyond this stuff. That there have always been people trying to get
it right. The history&#039;s been written by people who got it wrong. And I don&#039;t
think anything in my life has denied that, ever since. Time seems to be on the
side of justice. The people really do. Except today. [they laugh]

STEIN: One exception. So when you made this connection with David Borsten--

SOSKIN: Bortin. He was a Unitarian.

STEIN: Okay, so then did he--?

SOSKIN: That&#039;s when I became a Unitarian.

STEIN: And was it that he followed up the next day, or after that he--?

SOSKIN: We remain friends. We remain friends. He introduced me to a whole group
of people who were meeting then, about twenty-five or thirty families, in Nona
Bickerton&#039;s living room in Walnut Creek, who were an offshoot of the Berkeley
Unitarian church [First Unitarian Church of Berkeley], led by Dr. Raymond Cope,
C-O-P-E. [laughs] And I discovered that there was a religion, or at least a
philosophy--I didn&#039;t know what it was at that time; I couldn&#039;t tell what it
was--that was not based on answers; that all it was a collection of individuals
who were convinced of one thing, and that&#039;s that questions were where the action
is. And that if I develop my questions, that those answers are ever changing.
But that there were Christian Unitarians, that there were Buddhist Unitarians,
that there were Jewish Unitarians, that there were atheist Unitarians; that that
was not where the emphasis was. It was not in what we agreed upon. Those were
not things. It was possible.

At that point, I had a child who tested in the 99th percentile in science and
math. Rick--this was my gay son--Rick was so bright, the adopted child, that I
had tried--and I&#039;m still trying to make him a Catholic, right? [they laugh] Even
though I couldn&#039;t be a Catholic. Because I had promised his mother, right? Who
was nonexistent. And when he was about seven or eight years old, he was building
crystal sets. He was receiving radio signals. And I put him in catechism class
to study for his first communion, because my parents were saying, &quot;Doesn&#039;t
matter what you believe; you&#039;ve got to raise these children in a belief system
to save them, make them go to heaven,&quot; which I didn&#039;t believe in. And he was
coming home saying, &quot;Mom, if it takes thus and so many light years for a star&#039;s
light to reach from this star to the next one, how long does it take an angel?&quot;
I think, &quot;This kid&#039;s not going to make it.&quot; [they laugh] This kid is not going
to be a Catholic. So in order to satisfy my need for an intellectual community
in which I could expand my religious beliefs, or at least my spirituality, and
that I wouldn&#039;t have to answer my children&#039;s questions with God made the sky
blue, that this was the place for me to be. And it still is. I finally outgrew
that, but it did suffice for most of my lifetime. And it provided a community
that I considered to call home.

STEIN: Were your children ever involved in the Unitarian Church?

SOSKIN: My children were raised in the Unitarian Church. One is now a devout
Catholic. [laughs]

STEIN: Oh, wow.

SOSKIN: And I go with him to church occasionally. But that&#039;s his right. And I
think it&#039;s largely because of the family history and his need to tie to that.
Bob is probably an atheist, or at least an agnostic. Because the nature of our
conversations--and thank God my husband was away because I got to control all
the religious life of my children. His confusion--. [laughs] But Bob, his coming
in one day and saying--he was late for dinner. And I said, &quot;Where were you?&quot; And
he said, &quot;I was just sitting on the front porch with Randy and his mother.&quot; And
he said, &quot;We were having a conversation.&quot; And he said, &quot;You know, she kept
spouting the Bible to me, and she would do chapter and verse. And she asked me
something that I couldn&#039;t answer.&quot; And I said, &quot;What was that?&quot; And he said,
&quot;She asked me if I was an atheist.&quot; And he&#039;s now about thirteen. And I said, not
knowing what the answer was going to be, &quot;Are you?&quot; And he said, &quot;Well,&quot; he
says, &quot;I didn&#039;t know, but,&quot; he said, &quot;on the way home, I realized I&#039;m not.&quot; And
I said, &quot;Okay, so what do you say you are?&quot; And he says, &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I
don&#039;t know what I am, but,&quot; he said, &quot;there&#039;s no one up there not to believe
in.&quot; I thought, &quot;This is profound.&quot; [they laugh]

STEIN: Coming from a teenager.

SOSKIN: This is a thirteen-year-old. And we still have the most spirited
conversations about spirituality.

STEIN: Fascinating.

SOSKIN: And then I felt successful. And I do still. That David can be a
practicing Catholic and that Bob can be whatever he is, which I don&#039;t know, is a
sign of success. Because there&#039;s room for all of us, because we&#039;re not dependent
upon answers. So, yeah.

STEIN: You said--[comments with crew]--that there were some liberal members of
the community who wanted to befriend you to sort of authenticate their expansiveness.

SOSKIN: I think that&#039;s always true, yeah.

STEIN: Did you feel that same sentiment within the Unitarian community?

SOSKIN: No. No. That proved out to be authentic, as an experience and as a
connection. If there were those people initially, they evolved beyond that. An
indication is that when the sixties occurred--and I&#039;m living out there in the
suburbs, not being quite black enough for the city and not quite white enough
for the suburbs--[laughs] and this was my community, initially, it was upsetting
because I didn&#039;t know where I was. I was enjoying, by now, all of the advantages
of being a suburban housewife, and all of the disadvantages; but having lots and
lots to share with the people I was living among. When that, which could&#039;ve been
as disruptive, happened those people financed individually my experiencing the
black revolution nationally. They sent me to conventions that were black
caucuses. Not as a corporate decision, but people would send me checks with
notes saying, &quot;This, you ought to understand.&quot; And I was bringing back reports from--

STEIN: And you weren&#039;t--

SOSKIN: And I was on the national board of the Unitarian Black Caucus when the
Unitarian intellectuals had pulled out of the body. And I had pulled out with
them, with the consent of my church, who supported me in that. My minister and I
were collecting money for the Panthers and delivering it to Kathleen and
Eldridge Cleaver in San Francisco. In the suburbs. We brought a black dance
company in to perform at the local auditoriums&#039; civic center, so that that could
be experienced in the white suburbs. They supported me in my growth toward
blackness. And there&#039;s nothing fake about that. They supported my involvement in
the Black Caucus on a secret ballot, and there were only two votes against. And
both those people who voted against my being supported sent me notes. And their
fear was that I was going to be distanced from them. So even in that, there was
a positive thing.

STEIN: That&#039;s amazing.

SOSKIN: That experience was amazing. I don&#039;t know who can make that kind of
claim. And I think all that went into where my life went.

STEIN: Do you think that there is a larger role of the Unitarian Church in
advancing race relations or discussions of the sixties that has been left out of history?

SOSKIN: I think that the effect of the sixties in the Unitarian Church was
heading toward that kind of global change in attitudes racially. I think that it
got sidetracked, because we went into the eighties, which was the &quot;me&quot;
generation--the Werner Erhards and the human potential movement--and people
turned in, even in the Unitarian Church.

And that broader thing shrunk. Its African American membership, I think, may be
greater now than it&#039;s ever been, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s ever been the way it
should be. Mostly because the African Americans are still-- I think that
fundamentalism is still the strength of the black church, and that there&#039;s not
that much of a pool of black intellectuals that will be attracted by
Unitarianism. I think it&#039;s the only way to go. [they laugh] But I outgrew it
because I didn&#039;t really need it anymore.

STEIN: Right. It&#039;s a really fascinating story.
