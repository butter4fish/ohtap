Here as well. Nadine Wilmot with Ivy Reid
Lewis, August 4th, 2006. Okay, so good morning.

LEWIS: Good morning.

WILMOT: We usually start off by asking when and where were you born.

LEWIS: I was born in Oakland, California, February 25th, 1931.

WILMOT: 1931, and that was just like you were born kind of in the beginning of
the Depression.

LEWIS: Yes I think so.

WILMOT: And what are your parents’ names?

LEWIS: My mother’s name is Beryl Gwendolyn Holder Dash. She was born in
Bridgetown, Barbados. My father’s name is Charles Rogers Reid. He was born in
Angel’s Camp, California in 1898.

WILMOT: Where is that?

LEWIS: Calaveras County.

WILMOT: In California.

LEWIS: In the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. My grandmother, her family moved
there from San Francisco to pan for gold. Three of my aunts and my father were
born in Calaveras County.

WILMOT: So how far back do you know your family? And I’m sorry, I don’t
think I caught your father’s name?

LEWIS: Charles Rogers Reid. I know my family’s history because I did a lot of
research on the subject. My great-great grandfather William Henry Galt and his
wife and children came to California in 1861. His white father, who was a slave
owner, sent all of his black children to California by clipper ship over the
Isthmus of Panama. They came to San Francisco in 1861 The white father took his
immediate family and the black children’s mother to Bedford, Massachusetts to
wait out the war. The reason I know this is because my great-great
grandfather’s son Richard Galt drowned in the Sacramento River. He was twenty
one years of age and they sent a telegram to New Bedford, Massachusetts
informing his father of his son’s death. William Henry became a captain in the
California State Militia stationed at Sutter’s Fort. In 1873, at a July fourth
celebration, Governor Booth gave him an award for having one of the best
military outfits in the state at that time. I found this information in the
Sacramento Bee. My grandmother said that the Governor named Galt, California
after him; however, in my research, I did not find this information. The records
state that Galt was named after a poet.

WILMOT: And you said that the white slave-owner sent his children to California.
Do you know why?

LEWIS: To escape the Civil War. And he didn’t want to send them overland
because they might get caught and put in slavery because they were black, and he
sent them by clipper ship.

WILMOT: But he stayed with -- but the mom of the children stayed with him?

LEWIS: The mom of the children stayed with him and his family and they went to
New Bedford, Massachusetts until the Civil War was over.

WILMOT: So were they together?

LEWIS: That family, the Galt family, they were together, yes.

WILMOT: That must have been very rare during those times for --

LEWIS: I don’t know that it was rare because another part of my family was the
Turner family and their white father also sent their black children to
California at the same period of time, 1861. It is documented on our family’s
web site. My cousin Mary Lou Patterson is a physician and lives in New York
City. Her father was a well known attorney, William L. Patterson. He was one of
the first blacks to graduate from Hastings Law School. He wrote a book, The Man
Who Cried Genocide. Mr. Patterson and Paul Robeson, the famous opera singer,
petitioned the United Nations General Assembly in Paris and charged the United
States of America with genocide against black people. Mr. Patterson also worked
on the Sacco and Vanzetti and the Scottsboro and Angela Davis cases. Mary Lou
said that one day her father was at a speaking engagement in New Jersey and this
Caucasian man came up to them and said, “You’re a relative of mine.” He
was a member of the Galt family. Later he came to visit them in New York. We
have never pursued looking for the Galts, but we know that they reside somewhere
in Virginia because William Patterson’s mother who was William Galt’s
daughter periodically traveled back to Virginia to visit and it was the Galts
who paid for William Patterson’s college education.

WILMOT: How did you know all this history? Did your mother and your father talk
about it all the time? Or how did you learn --

LEWIS: William L. Patterson, who’s now deceased, wrote a book, The Man Who
Cried Genocide. In the preface of his book, he talks about his family. That’s
originally how I learned about it. And when I was a student at Cal I met a Mr.
Abajian. James Abajian. And I was talking to him. He says, “You know you have
a very prominent family.” You have a big history. It’s part of my anthology
about blacks in California. He gave me a lot of information about my family
through census records. The 1900 census. My grandparents lived in Angel’s
Camp. And Mary Patterson who was a barber -- she was married to some man and
they lived in Battle Mountain, Nevada. So I got a lot of information from Mr.
Abajian and then I did a lot of research myself. Mary Patterson and her husband
sometimes gave Virginia as their place of birth.

WILMOT: And when you were little, before you learned all this, was your family
-- did you grow up with your grandmothers? Were they here?

LEWIS: Yeah, I would like to say something. Even though my family originally
came from Virginia, my immediate parents, we were not southerners. So we have a
different perspective. Most things I hear southerners say, to me -- I don’t
see the same. My parents, my father was a semi professional ballplayer in
California. And so we were always involved in a lot of sports. And my
grandmother lived in Berkeley on California Street. She was originally born on
Minna Street, now an alley in San Francisco. And I think that Goldie said her
parents lived on that same street, too. Nadine Byrd told me that. They all lived
on the same street. When I was growing up, my grandmother lived in Berkeley. And
at that time, we could ride down Highway 40, which is now Carson Boulevard in
Richmond. We could ride our bicycles over to Berkeley to see my grandmother. And
I loved to go to my grandmother’s because she made apple butter and she always
had good things to eat. My uncle worked at -- well, now it’s Hostess Bakery,
but it used to be Langendorf Bakery -- and he used to bring all the cakes and
things over to my grandmother’s. And we all congregated at my grandmother’s
all the time. I had a lot of aunts. My grandmother had 13 children. So we had a
large family.

WILMOT: And she was at California and --

LEWIS: She was a Californian. Her mother was Annie Galt so she was the first
generation of Galts born in San Francisco.

WILMOT: And she lived on California Street, and what was the cross street?

LEWIS: In Berkeley. Ward Street.

WILMOT: Ward. So right in that area. Right next to that --

LEWIS: Right across from a school, yeah.

WILMOT: I know exactly where that is. Okay, and your grandmother’s name?

LEWIS: Virginia Reid.

WILMOT: Virginia Reid.

LEWIS: She was originally a Parker. Her father Edward West Parker registered to
vote on the first day the 15th Amendment to the constitution was enacted. He
gave his occupation as a special boot maker and his place of birth as Virginia.
Mr. Abajian gave me this information and also showed me where he voted. My
grandmother used to talk about the San Francisco earthquake and fire and how all
the people would come to her house -- She saw how the fire was burning, it
turned the moon red, it looked like there was blood on the moon. She always told
a lot of history. My father was sort of a historian. Someone recorded his
history but I don’t know who he gave it to. But he talked about Berkeley when
it was a small city and San Pablo Avenue was a dirt road.

WILMOT: That’s how he remembered it. And your mother was from Barbados.

LEWIS: Yes.

WILMOT: How did she and your father get together?

LEWIS: Oh, I think my father went to a party or something or a picnic and he met
my mother. My mother, you have to know a little history of California. When I
was a child, West Oakland was sort of like Sugar Hill, where the rich people
moved out and more working-class families moved in, but not a lot of black
people. A lot of immigrant people. Where we lived, there were Syrian people,
Italian people, all different groups of people lived in West Oakland and they
lived in these big old Victorian houses. We still have that Victorian house in
our family. My sister now owns it. But it was really a nice neighborhood and
people, my girlfriend Lala, her name was Elaine Chukovich, she was Russian. All
different kinds of people lived there and it was really a nice neighborhood.

WILMOT: Where was this house located, the house you grew up in?

LEWIS: At 1926 Chestnut Street in Oakland.

WILMOT: Okay, and that was West Oakland.

LEWIS: Yeah, West Oakland. But West Oakland, even when we went down to Wood
Street -- because I remember so many things. You know the lottery they now have,
like Keno, what they play in Las Vegas and Reno, it started in Oakland.
Originally, the Chinese had the Chinese lottery, because I remember they used to
deliver it, throw it on your doorstep. And my mother would play it and she would
take me, we’d go down to West Oakland and play the tickets. They call them
tickets. And all those big beautiful homes, they tore them all down, they were
just beautiful, beautiful homes. Oakland tore down so many beautiful homes until
somebody said Stop, you’re tearing down really fabulous homes. They did. They
tore down a lot. The Chinese moved their lottery to Reno, Nevada and opened
gambling establishments. Before they moved to Reno, blacks were not allowed in
the casinos. But it was really a nice neighborhood. We had several people who
were West Indian people. We used to visit down in those areas. But mostly it was
not an all black neighborhood. It was a mixed neighborhood.

WILMOT: And so you grew up with people from all different backgrounds. Would you
say that racism was an issue when you were growing up?

LEWIS: It was very subtle. There was racism but it was not like it is in the
south. I mean, we didn’t have that extreme racism. People all lived in mixed neighborhoods.

WILMOT: Like say when you were an adolescent then, was interracial dating
something that was accepted? I mean, could you -- I mean did you even want --
did you want to have dates with white boys or --

LEWIS: [chuckles] Well, funny thing about that is that we lived in this
neighborhood where a lot of people who were black looked like they were white.
And they used to go to work every day as white people and came home at night as
black people. And I have a half-sister who’s passed for white for years. In
fact she doesn’t speak to me. Although my grandmother used to say Ivy and
Bertha look alike, only Bertha’s white and Ivy’s black. So I don’t
remember, I know my aunts, both my aunts were married to Filipino men. And all
of my uncles, my Uncle Vander was from British Guyana and my Uncle Robinson was
from Jamaica and they were all chef cooks and so was my Uncle Gene -- he was
Filipino, he was a chef cook. So I grew up around a lot of mixed people. So I
never really noted -- and a lot of my family looked like Caucasians. So I
didn’t have that problem. I mean, as seeing mixed couple didn’t -- I just
took it for granted that’s the way people lived.

WILMOT: But as an adolescent, when you were growing up, was that something --
like in your social group were there mixed white and black couples?

LEWIS: When I grew up in North Richmond, and I went to Peres School, until I was
in the third or fourth grade I was the only black child in the class. I have a
picture I can show you. There’s maybe seven black families in North Richmond,
it was all Italian and Portuguese and all mixed groups of people, some Spanish
people. So I played with all different groups of people. When I got older the
whole city of Richmond changed because of World War II so I never saw -- I
don’t think I ever saw any white people and black people together -- I mean as
boyfriend and girlfriend. But my half-sister Bertha married a white man.

WILMOT: As teenagers. I think I’m confused because on one hand I have you in
West Oakland, and now I have you in North Richmond, so could you break down for
me the chronology? Like, you grew up in West Oakland --

LEWIS: I grew up in Oakland. My parents moved to Richmond when I was three years
old, but I spent a lot of my time in Oakland. Summers and going to camp and
going to DeFremery Park. My mother and father worked. So they didn’t leave us
at home and when we were small in Richmond we always went to my grandmother’s
or to my aunt’s in Oakland. My grandmother and my aunt, they didn’t want us
to move to Richmond because my aunt considered herself to be a very socially
prominent person and she had this huge beautiful home and she always gave these
big parties and --

WILMOT: Where was her home?

LEWIS: On Chestnut Street.

WILMOT: Same house?

LEWIS: Same house. And Richmond was sort of a throwback, she said the people
were ignorant there and there was no social life. In fact one of my aunts wanted
my mother to take me to stay in school in Berkeley and not go to school in
Richmond because they considered it a backward place. And we moved to Richmond.
So we spent most of our time in Oakland. We were not involved. In fact, the
first time my family was really -- my mother was a good swimmer and we always --
when we lived in Oakland -- I don’t know where Depression Beach is, okay, I
couldn’t tell you, but I assume it’s someplace down in the general vicinity
of Jack London Square, some of that area down there, and my mother -- they
always went down there. My mother was a good swimmer, and my father said my
mother used to swim across the estuary all the time. So the estuary was from
Oakland to Alameda, I think, and back. So when we came to Richmond, we lived in
North Richmond, and at that time, Chevron had not blocked off the bay. The bay
used to come into North Richmond and you could go swimming at a place down at
the end of Vernon Street, they called the slough. So when we first moved to
Richmond, Sunday morning we went swimming, and the people in the church talked
about us. [laughs] They said these new people came and went swimming on Sunday
and they thought that was terrible. So we never really fit in in Richmond when
we first moved there. It was mostly southern black people and --

WILMOT: They talked about you in church?

LEWIS: Yeah, they said that --

WILMOT: Which church was this?

LEWIS: This was the Baptist church.

WILMOT: Which one was it?

LEWIS: And our neighbors told us about it. But then my mother became very
popular because she was a good cook. And at that time, I remember the WPA and
the Depression people. A lot of people didn’t have food, and my mother used to
cook a big pot of food and feed people.

WILMOT: Well, you said that your mom -- okay, so your mom was from Barbados. Now
did she grow up in Barbados?

LEWIS: Yes, she did.

WILMOT: So how did your father find her?

LEWIS: Well, he came down to Oakland to a party or something and he met my
mother. Either they went -- I think they were in a park, like a picnic.

WILMOT: So she was already here.

LEWIS: She was already here.

WILMOT: Is her family here?

LEWIS: My aunt who I talk about, my Aunt Maude Robinson, who lived on Chestnut
Street, my grandmother’s name was Ivy. And Ivy died and my mother was orphaned
and when her father died -- my mother’s father was Caucasian -- and when he
died, her sisters didn’t want to keep her because she was a half-sister of
theirs. So a lady took my mother and kept her.

WILMOT: These are white sisters or black sisters?

LEWIS: They were white sisters. And when my mother grew up, this lady raised
her. Her name was Aunt Liz. And then when she got to be about 12, I think, or
13, Aunt Liz died. So she really didn’t have a family. And she had some
cousins but they didn’t really pay her too much attention. And my aunt said
she had a dream that Ivy came and asked her to send for my mother. So she did.
And my mother came here when she was15 years old. And my mother was very a
beautiful woman.

WILMOT: Did she have an accent?

LEWIS: Pardon me.

WILMOT: Did she have an accent?

LEWIS: Yes she did, yeah.

WILMOT: What do you remember about your mother’s Caribbean culture? Her Bajian culture?

LEWIS: She’s a Bajian.

WILMOT: What do you remember about her culture? What did you learn from her
about being Bajian?

LEWIS: My mother was a really good cook and she used to cook a lot of West
Indian food. In fact every Christmas I still make coconut bread. In Barbados
they have it every day, but we only make it once a year. And she used to make
cou cou and fish, she was very -- my mother was really a good person, she would
give you her coat off her back, because she was an orphan, she always took in
children -- people would come and leave their children at our house and my
mother raised so many other people’s children. They would just drop them off
and not come back and get them for a while.

WILMOT: How many siblings that were hers, how many -- ?

LEWIS: We had three children in our family. But my mother raised three more
children from babies until they were about 12 or 15. And then, she had other
people just leave their kids there, like, they worked and they’d leave them
there all week, and she always had a houseful of kids.

WILMOT: And your half-brothers and sisters, they were on your father’s side or
your mother’s side?

LEWIS: My half-brothers and sisters on my father -- my father was previously
married and he had two children, Bertha and Donald.

WILMOT: What a story. Well how did Ivy get here then? I think I may have missed that.

LEWIS: Ivy didn’t come here. Ivy died -- my grandmother, Ivy, was from British
Guyana and when my mother was five years old she went back to British Guyana and
my mother never saw her again.

WILMOT: So the woman who sent for your mom --

LEWIS: Maude Robinson.

WILMOT: And she was Auntie?

LEWIS: Ivy’s sister.

WILMOT: Auntie. How did Maude get here?

LEWIS: They migrated from Barbados a long time ago. I think my Aunt Maude was a
teenager when they came to the United States. Her mother and father migrated to
California and brought my aunt with them. They had three children: my Aunt Maude
and Uncle Vander and Ivy, my grandmother. I think my Uncle Vander came on his
own. They left Ivy with her grandmother. Maude was born in Venezuela. Jules
Vander and Ivy were born in British Guyana. My Uncle Vander spoke fluent
Castilian Spanish I remember vaguely Maude’s father. I never knew her mother.
But she was somewhat like my mother because she fed and took care of a lot of
people. One of the people she cared for was a West Indian man who was a merchant
seaman. Somehow he got into trouble and he jumped ship in Manila. He became one
of the richest men in Manila. I remember when they came to visit my aunt they
would have like ten taxi cabs with theirs luggage [laughs] and everything.
During World War II when the Japanese invaded the Philippines, Mr. Pritchard and
his son were captured and forced in the march in Corregidor. H sent his wife and
younger children to California and they stayed with my aunt for a while.

WILMOT: Okay, hold on one second. I’m doing some adjustments over here. [pause]

LEWIS: So even though I lived in Richmond, a lot of my social life was in
Oakland. [laughs] My family thought Richmond wasn’t too good.

WILMOT: How did you get back and forth?

LEWIS: You know what? I tell people that on Saturdays the Key system used to
have free buses. You could ride free. Now they’re talking about this new
system where you can ride free. This isn’t a new invention, because when I was
a child, on Saturdays, you could get on the bus and go free to Oakland. Because
everybody went to the -- was it the Seventh Street Market? Some market down there?

WILMOT: Housewives’ Market?

LEWIS: Housewives’ Market. But it wasn’t called the Housewives’ Market
then. It was called Swan’s Market or something like that. We used to go to
Swan’s Market too. Everybody did.

WILMOT: It’s so beautiful hearing you talk about Oakland and hearing you talk
about your childhood.

LEWIS: Oakland was really beautiful. We lived near 16th Street so we used to go
up and catch the streetcar and go. And downtown Oakland where City Hall is, they
had a plaza with all beautiful flowers and gardens around it. I know now, the
discrimination, I remember we went to camp. I don’t know where the camp was. I
couldn’t tell you. But I went with the kids from DeFremery Park. It was mostly
black kids in those days, but I remember it was a mixed group, because my friend
Lala came also. And this was before World War II, or it might have been just
almost at the beginning of World War II. We went to summer camp and when we came
out, some girls were there from Piedmont, and they were all white and they
started calling us names. I don’t know why [laughs] white people want to call
black people names, I don’t know what we ever did to them, but they looked
kind of silly.

WILMOT: Did you smack them?

LEWIS: No, I didn’t. No. I don’t know what their problem was but anyway, I
didn’t have the same problem they did. But things like that, people calling
you names. Once in a while that happened. I remember when I went to kindergarten
in Richmond, one girl didn’t want to hold my hand because I was black. But I
never had really a lot of problems -- I was really a popular kid with other children.

WILMOT: So you were in North Richmond. Can you tell me the address of that place there?

LEWIS: In North Richmond? When we first moved to North Richmond, we lived on
Filbert Street and we rented from some Italian people, I can’t think of their
name. But then we moved. When I lived in North Richmond, we lived all around
Italian people. And I got used to eating dry salami with French bread, and they
would always have that, and everybody sat around in the afternoon talking,
eating French bread and salami and salad and drinking Dago red, they called it.
[laughs] North Richmond was really a small community -- I lived in the city part
of North Richmond most of my life, and it was paved but it was still county. It
was not incorporated in those days. And but if you went past Chesley Avenue, it
was nothing -- and I tell people that so many black historians have wrote about
the cabbage patch; I didn’t see any cabbage patch in North Richmond. Mr. Longo
-- when you went out First Creek, far as you could see there was lettuce. They
grew iceberg lettuce. And over the Second Bridge. We used to call the different
bridges First Bridge, Second Bridge, First Creek, Second Creek, which was the
First Creek was the big creek, Second Creek was a smaller creek next to North
Richmond. But if you went across there the Baronis had a farm. Now he probably
had some cabbage, but he also grew a lot of vegetables at the Baroni farm. In
North Richmond, there was a big family who lived out on Market Street called the
Turners, and they were black. And there wasn’t too many more people -- the
Marlbroughs and the Turners had the biggest families. And I remember Richard
Granzella, I used to like Richard Granzella when I was three years old. He would
come down the street. Richard and Nelson Carter. Nelson and Richard Granzella
were really good friends. And they used to go down to the dumps and dig around
there because people would go down and nobody owned the dumps at that time.
People would just go down and dump their things and then Richard and Nelson used
to go down and do salvage work. And then Richard became the owner of the
Richmond garbage dump. [laughs] So it was interesting. I knew those people when.

WILMOT: Did you know anyone named Alfred Granzella?

LEWIS: Oh, I went to school with Alfred Granzella. Yeah, I went to Peres
Elementary School. Yeah, we were in the same room, same grade together.

WILMOT: Do you remember what he was like?

LEWIS: Alfred was a good little kid. I remember he was short and I was taller. I
knew all those people who lived north of 7th Street. Let’s see, there were the
Banduccis, the Dell Simones, the Grandzellas and Angie Mapeli and Mary and Tony
Uder. All the girls liked Tony -- he was good looking. Yeah, I knew all of those
people. I went to school with them. Alfred was always a likeable kid.

WILMOT: Okay, what did your parents do? What kind of work did your family do?
What were your parents?

LEWIS: We moved to Richmond because my father got a job at the Richmond Pullman
Company sandblasting cars. My mother worked in the cannery and when the cannery
wasn’t on, sometimes she did housework, but mostly she worked at Del Monte
Cannery in Emeryville. There was a big cannery there. And all my aunts worked
there too, Del Monte Cannery.

WILMOT: Did anyone in your family go to college? Was your father or your mother
a college graduate?

LEWIS: No, my father finished high school, but my mother didn’t. My mother
went, she said, as far -- in Barbados, you go to a certain grade and only if
your family’s wealthy you can go further. But they all knew how to read and
write and stuff like that, but they were not college graduates. My mother went
to school later. I don’t know too much about my grandmother’s education. But
all of my cousins and aunts were college graduates on both sides of the family.

WILMOT: On your mother’s side or --

LEWIS: On my father’s side. I never knew my mother’s mother. I never knew my
grandparents on my mother’s side. I knew my grandfather on my father’s side
died the same year I was born. But he came from Griffin, Georgia. And my cousin
said there’s a dispute -- they have a story about a guy who was a bouncer.
[chuckles] Well, my grandfather was a bouncer at Jim Corbett’s Saloon in San
Francisco. And when they wrote a story -- they made a movie about that. My
cousin says they didn’t write it right because her grandfather was the bouncer
at Jim Corbett’s Saloon in San Francisco. But I didn’t know him but I just
knew my grandmother. My grandfather came from Griffin, Georgia. His mother was
half black and Seminole Indian and his father was white.

WILMOT: You mentioned that in Oakland you lived in a neighborhood where there
were many passing black people.

LEWIS: I didn’t know that when I was a child but I figured it out when I got older.

WILMOT: How did you figure it out?

LEWIS: Well, I just figured it out that these people, they all looked like they
were white, but they were not white. And they all worked in nice office jobs
that blacks couldn’t get. So I just figured it out after I got older.

WILMOT: So it was like a whole community.

LEWIS: It wasn’t a whole community, but it was a lot of people who lived in
the community.

WILMOT: Was there language for that when you were young? Was there a language
for oh so-and-so is passing? Was there a language for that behavior?

LEWIS: Nobody I heard talk about it.

WILMOT: And when you moved to Richmond were you in a similar community or --

LEWIS: No, heavens, no. Richmond was more rural. When we moved to North Richmond
it was the country, RFD.

WILMOT: RFD.

LEWIS: People had cows. My neighbors down the street, the parents were from
Arkansas and they had cows and a windmill and they used to shoot possums and
coons and eat them. [laughs] And one day, my girlfriend’s mother had a possum
cooking, and she says, “I want to have a turkey for Thanksgiving just like
Mrs. Reid cooks.” [laughs] Well, we always went over to see the possums and
the coons. And they had chickens. And they taught me how to milk cows and how to
churn butter. It was a different life. What the kids would do in the evenings --
I was like the little devil -- they would go out and pull people’s corn. A lot
of people grew corn, and they would go and get the corn and make a fire and
roast it. And I would get in the window and go [makes siren sound] “Aaah!”
like I was the fire department and the kids would start running. But anyway, my
neighbor, Mrs. Delgadillo, she taught me how to speak Spanish because a lot of
my friends were all Spanish and I would go over their houses all the time and
help them do their housework and their parents would be talking to them in
Spanish so I just sort of picked up on it. I’d go help Mrs. Delgadillo grind
her corn and clean up the corn husks and put them in a sack and everything. And
then they’d kill a hog and they would get a big copper kettle and put it over
the fire in the backyard and make chicherones and tamales and all kind of stuff.
I learned how to do all those things.

WILMOT: Let me just adjust this for one second. Did you go to a place called the Plunge?

LEWIS: We used to walk down the railroad tracks to the Plunge, down the Santa Fe
tracks. Goes from North Richmond, you go straight to the plunge.

WILMOT: Did you know about the group of Native Americans who were --

LEWIS: Yeah. I have a picture -- I don’t have a picture of them, but my father
used to play ball at the First Street Park, there used to be a big ballpark at
First Street and McDonald. And then right down from the ballpark close to where
Saint John’s Apartments -- there were some little grey concrete buildings. I
think they were two like barracks. And that’s where the Indians lived. And
then some of them lived over in the Santa Fe yards, also.

WILMOT: Were there connections there socially? Did you connect with them? Or was
it -- ?

LEWIS: They went to school with me, but let me tell you about a situation I
remember. At 16th and MacDonald, they had carnivals and they wouldn’t let the
Indians come in.

WILMOT: Did they let little black children come in?

LEWIS: Yeah, but they wouldn’t let the Indians come in. One man came one day
and I think he was drunk and I remember the man said that they’re not
manageable when they get drunk, whatever. I was a little kid. I just -- my
brother said -- my brother used to call me the Black Dispatch because I would
listen to every conversation anybody had [laughs] and I knew everything, so I
heard that man say that, that they were not manageable if they were drunk. So
they put them out of the carnival.

WILMOT: Were there Asian people in Richmond? Chinese, Japanese?

LEWIS: Oh, I had a lot of Japanese friends in school. My brother used to work
for Mr. Abbe.

WILMOT: What’s your brother’s name?

LEWIS: Charles. And my brother worked for Mr. Abbe at the nurseries.

WILMOT: A-B-E-I?

LEWIS: Mr. Abbe who owned the nurseries -- north of Wildcat Creek, he had all
those greenhouses and grew long-stemmed roses. And there was a Japanese man next
to him, too, who owned them and I think when he got interned, when they put them
in internment camps, Mr. Abbe kept his place going for him. I read that story in
the Reader’s Digest. But I didn’t know that at the time. But my brother
worked for Mr. Abbe for a long time.

WILMOT: So when you were in high school it was basically really your high school
years that the war was going on, is that correct?

LEWIS: No, the war started when I was ten years old. I went to junior high
school, I didn’t finish school here, I moved to Los Angeles, so I went to
school in Los Angeles. When I first -- I think it was in the fourth or fifth
grade when I came to school, there was a lot of black children who moved here
because of World War II. And everything start changing then in Richmond. It got
to be more discriminatory -- my father used to go and cash his checks when he
got off work. My father didn’t drink. But he used to shine shoes in downtown
Richmond with a guy called Ollie Freeman. He played blues and he was a local
disk jockey but he had a really nice shoeshine parlor. And people would come in
and my father worked there on Saturdays. Yeah, I think he only worked on
Saturdays. When he got off work, he would go and cash his check at 16th and
MacDonald. One of the local city councilmen, [Gay Vargus], he owned a bar, and
he asked my father not to come anymore because he said he didn’t want black
people to think that they could all come in there. He didn’t mind my father
coming, but he didn’t want this to be a black bar. So that’s the only thing
I knew about. Other than that, I never had any problem. But the white people who
came -- they caused more discrimination. I remember once when I was about 16 I
think I went to the skating rink in Oakland. And this white kid said to me,
“You’re supposed to come on Thursday nights.” I said, “I can come on any
night I want to come, and I’m coming here and you can’t tell me when I --
.” “Well, the black people -- ” they called them colored people --
“usually come on Thursday nights.” I said, “Too bad.” And I didn’t
learn till after I was grown and I went to the south, if they had like when the
state fair was on or something, the black people only came on Thursday nights or
they came on that day, Thursday, was the day for black people. So they were
trying to institute their own thing. This happened after the war. And I remember
when I was in junior high school, a lot of the people pet</transcript><transcript_alt></transcript_alt><rights></rights><fmt>video</fmt><usage></usage><userestrict>0</userestrict><xmllocation></xmllocation><xmlfilename></xmlfilename><collection_link></collection_link><series_link></series_link></record></ROOT>
