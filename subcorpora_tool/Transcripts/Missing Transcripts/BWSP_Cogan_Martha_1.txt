so:

This is an interview with Martha Cogan who graduated
from Pembroke in 1926. I'd like to first ask you, could you talk
a little bit about your family background and how you wound
up at Brown - Pembroke.
MC: Well, I was born in Providence ...

so:

Oh really?

MC: And I went to public school, and I did my highschool at
Hope Street highschool. I did my course in two and a half years
instead of four. Because we were going to get through in
February you see. So I decided I would do it in three and a half
years, so that I could get into college. So that a lot of the people
in my class in grammar school are now class of '27 instead of
'26. And then I went, and it happened I had a Sunday school
teacher whose son was the registrar at Brown University, and
he arranged me to have a scholarship. And uh, so I, I entered
Brown, and began taking a regular , a regular course -fine art,
but I wanted also a lot of french, because I'd had I think three
and a half years of french, at , at , at highschool. I had a
wonderful french teacher. And that always stood me in good
stead. So I specialized in languages when I went to, uh Brown.
And then, urn, during this time I was interested in languages
because I was a, I grew up in a family that belonged to the
First Baptist Church in Providence. And, urn, I was taken to
Church when I was three years old, every Sunday by my uncle,
who was very .. .a very ardent religious man, and who believed
in all the old-fashioned virtues, and we used to walk through
Brown University, run around the track twice, and then go to
Church, and (SG laughs) then come back from Church, run
around the track and then walk the rest of the way home.

so:

Run around the track for exercise?

MC: In the urn, in the Quadrangle,
Sunday morning. You can imagine
running along after her father, her
and uncle brought me up , becau se

you know. For exercise every
the three-year-old child
uncle actually. My, my aunt
my mother, urn , was urn,

went abroad, went back to see her family right after I was
born. So my aunt and uncle, they lived in the double house, and
the aunt and uncle on one side, and the father mother on the
other side. So I was left with my aunt and uncle to be taken
care of. Then my mother came back, pregnant immediately and
had another child, so my aunt and uncle kept on taking care of
me. So I really, had a two, two parents, all during my youth ­
childhood and youth. But, urn my aunt and uncle had one son
and they had always wanted a daughter, so they clung to me
and they called, and really they were like my own parents. So I
grew up there, and this very religious background, and of
course we heard constantly at Sunday School, about the
medical missionaries abroad, and what they were doing in
Africa and all over the world. And that was the one thing I
wanted to do. I wanted to go help those poor people who had
such a rough time. And so when I went to Brown, I studied
languages and fine arts, and, and when I was a senior and
graduated, I decided by that time, that I really couldn't afford
to go to medical school. So, I decided to become a social worker.
So, I went out to uh, Chicago, to the recreation training school,
which was under Northwestern University, and took a special
course in recreation training which was held at Health house.
And actually I used to have lunch, with you won't believe it,
with Jane Adams. And she was an elderly lady, but absolutely
delightful, and she used to eat in the cafeteria every day at
lunch. And uh, so she used to talk to all of us, and we all had a
great time, and we learned all about social work in a very
windy, and very difficult city. And I lived, during that time at
the nearest uh, uh, social welfare house, actually it was, Chicago
Commons. And it was started by a family, very much
interested in helping the area, and I worked at Chicago
Commons, everybody had to work who was at the school, uh,
and uh evenings we'd take classes and put on plays and do all
kinds of things, uh, girls clubs, and I had twenty-six
nationalities, in one of my clubs, so you can see how varied my
background was. And so that's how I became started in social
work. And urn, in the meantime, I had, I had met a urn, man
who was at Harvard Law School, and who was a great friend of
my family, and urn he came to see me, whenever he came out
to Chicago, and three years after I graduated from college we
were married. And uh, I went, I moved back to Boston, and um,
where he had his office ... he was, at that time, the director of
religious education for all the Unitarian Churches in the United

States. But after we had been, then I had my first child in
Hingham Massachusetts, a boy, and urn, of course he had to go
to Harvard too, and I learned a great deal about that kind of
suburban life. We had thirteen families of Cushing on our side
of the street. So whenever you went to Church, you said "Good
morning Mrs. Cushing" to every woman you met. (SG laughs)
And actually, Dr. Cushing and all the other Cushings descended
from that area. We bought an old General Theopolis Cushing
Tavern, and made it over into this old antique house with eight
fireplaces in it, and paneling in every room. My husband was
becoming very tired of what he was doing. And not only that,
he was atking courses at Harvard Theological School, in
mysterial subjects. So when he'd go out to make a speech to the
Unitarian Education Program, he would ask me to go and take
all his courses at Harvard in philosophy and religion and all the
rest of it. And I'd have to give him all the notes later.
SG: Were you allowed into the classes?
MC: Oh yes. Because, urn, most English professors in Harvard
couldn't have been nicer. In fact one of the great philosophers
once said to me, " ... what are you doing here?" (she says with
accent) And I explained about my husband's lectures. "Oh," he
said, ''I'm not really either. I'm just learning". And so they were
always fun. And uh, and I got to know the whole philosophy
department at Harvard .
SG: And they were open to having you as a woman there?
'Cause I assume all the other students were men.
MC: Well, there never were any other women sitting around.
But, I took all the courses with him. So then after, after awhile,
I decided to sign up at Radcliffe. So, then I took my, I decided
to take a degree in comparative literature - in the Victorian
period in French, German and English. And that was fun. And I,
and I got my degree just before my uh, son was born, in uh, in
uh ........ when I was still commuting and going to Harvard form,
uh Hingham. Then my husband became minister of the
Unitarian Church in Western Pennsylvania, and it was quite a
change.
SG: I can Imagine.

MC: Mrs. Henry T. Tidder Sr, the widow of the uh., I don't know
if this is at all interesting to you, the widow of Henry T. Tidder,
who started Tidder Peabody and Company was the grande?) of
the Church and of the community. And she wore what we call
Boston hats, and she taught me how I should behave as a
Boston woman who was living in Western Pennsylvania,
because .... but the most important thing she taught me was:
they never say "that's the way they do it in Boston". She used
to spend half her year in Boston, and half her year in
Pennsylvania, because she said "They're very irritated if they
don't think this is the best place in the world. After all, oil Was
discovered in this area of Pennsylvania," and she said" the
canalleres descendants, are all here - around here, and uh, the
people who built the Erie canal. And therefore," she said" you
have to uh, so I became President of the Women's Club. And I
had uh ...
SG: How did you come around to that? Was it something .... why
did you want to do that?
MC: Well, nothing .. .I belonged to all the clubs, because my
husband was the minister. And I started the Sunday School,
and I was uh, I was asked to join the Women's Club, and urn,
Allegheny College was in the town, so all the wives of all the
professors at Allegheny belonged, and they were all friends of
ours ... and at the end .. .! lived there three years. And the last
year I was there, I was elected President of the Women's Club.
Then I did the first house-to-house canvas in the whole of
Meadville(?) and for, I could find out whether we would join
the League of Nations, because I was terribly interested in the
League of Nations, and we didn't belong. So I went house-to­
house one summer for two weeks, and went to every house in
Meadville, and asked how many people ... and I got more people
signed up for the League of Nations than had ever voted in the
community. So I immediately called the congressman, and he
said "Alright" , he voted so and so ... .from then on he called me
before he voted on every deal that had to do with international
relations. So you see, I was a bu sy minister's wife.
SG: How did you get motivated to, to do that canvasing? And
did people react strangely when you came to their door. .. .?
MC: One woman said" Oh, that's a new kind of cereal isn't it?

when I went to her. ... (SG laughs) Many people had never heard
of the United Nations. So, it became an educational program.
And it was, it was a very interesting experience to find out
what kind of people really lived in the community.
SG: Did people, were people surprised when you'd come to their
door canvasing ..... (MC: Well, they thought I was selling
something ..... ) .... a woman was talking about a political.. ..
MC: Well, you didn't start that way. You started in as a
neighbor, and then you talked about it. Anyway, I, I actually
got the town, in, registered as the largest group of people who
were interested in international relations and the United States

JOlnIng.
SG: All because of you ...
MC: Yes. No, but, I mean if you want to know ... you said if you
want to do something with your life and you like it.. .. sell other
people. Then my husband was called to Wellesley Hills
Massachusetts. Church there, and we arrived in Wellesley, and
had a huge parsonage, something like twelve or fourteen
rooms ... huge, urn huge verandas running around it and so, and
there was no Sunday school, and it was a, uh, a rather upper­
middle class church, in which one man who belonged to our,
our parish, really owned most of the land, and he would only
sell to people he liked. So, it was uh, a, quite a strict sort of, sort
of beginning. We had a wonderful time. We went parish-calling
on every new person who came to Wellesley, and we built a
Sunday school of hundreds of children, and then I taught
Sunday school along with doing this, and uh, and we started all
kinds of clubs, and one of them was the International club. And
this was the time when Czechoslovakia was being threatened
by the Nazis, and they had taken the state and land, and we
had .. and my husband and I were responsible for the evening of
discussion on Czechoslovakia . And we were so upset about
what the Nazis did, that when the Unitarians found out that our
Unitarian Churches uh, had been taken and all their
congregations .... the ministers imprisoned, an the congregations
arrested, and put into camps, prison camps, uh, and they
decided they would send a minister and his wife over to see
what they could do to help the people in the country, just as
observers. My husband was asked if he would go, he said "Of

course I'll go. I hate those Nazis." And uh, but now you see, I
had a little child of three, and a son of five. And I said"But I
can't go," and my husband said "Well, I'm not going without
you, and I intend to go". And, so I got my aunt and uncle who
were loyal Unitarians, to come and live in the parsonage. We
organized the Church so that they could run themselves, took
my husband's salary and paid preachers who'd come every
Sunday and give them ...... and of our own money what
Czechoslovakia and arrived in this absolute turmoil of the
country. This was in February of 1939.

so:

Did you, by the time that you decided to go, did you resent
being dragged to Czechoslovakia, or was it something that you
really wanted to do?
MC: Well, I was very upset about the children of course, And I
never forget the, when we drove out of the driveway, and my
little daughter was standing on the sofa, and waving and saying
"Mommy go bye-bye". because to leave her, even though we
had a maid, and my aunt and uncle were wonderful. And they
really, uh, my aunt just really ran the household, and they
moved over from Cambridge. I mean they kept their apartment
in Cambridge. My uncle worked in, had plants in Lowell, and in
New England. So she could come over and he could come home
as often as he was able. But they really did a great service.
They did it for Czechoslovakia really. Everybody was was, in
the church was working for Czechoslovakia. The women began
collecting old clothes, and all sorts of things were done. Well,
we arrived in Prague in February, 1939.

so:

Were you nervous at all? ... Going into a warzone?

MC: Well, I was seasick all the way coming over in the boat,
because we had a tough time getting off because first of all, the
President had come ... all the boats, and decided nobody could go
into certain waters, And then finally, they let us sail. And
before we left we had a delightful time with, twice we had
conferences with (?), the son of the President, the former
president, and uh, we learned a great deal about the country.
And we realized we could speak German, although I couldn't
speak Czech, I brushed up my german in the meantime. And
uh, anyway, we arrived .... !'ll never forget it. First we were told
we must go to Paris, because in Paris, the director of the (?)

Endowment had his office, and he was one of the people that
decided that America should do something uh, for
Czechoslovakia to help. So, he had asked us to come there first,
because the International committee that directed the Carn(?)
Endowment had the premiers of every country in Europe as
their Board of Directors. So, he could find out...and he knew
everything that was happening. And he introduced us to
everybody in Paris who was interested in Czechoslovakia, and
of course the church , you know, had organized this terrific
democracy, under a (?), which was really operating, and if you
want to talk about women having responsibilities, they had a
proportion of the Assembly had to be women. Way back at that
time. This was '38. And so when we arrived, the Minister of
Health had decided to offer us offices in Prague in the Ministry
of Health, because there were so many health problems
involved. And he was down at the, at the urn, dock to meet us,
I...the train, because we came in by boat to Paris, and then we
went by train from Paris to Prague. And he also had the head
of the Czechoslovak churches. When the Nazis took, no when
when they organized a democracy in Czechoslovakia, the
National Czechoslovak church was the biggest church in the
country, and it was a Roman Catholic church. And the Czechs
decided that they believed they were gonna have democracy
and their religion at the same time. So, three hundred thousand
Czechs left the Roman Catholic Church, and joined the
International Church of Czech Liberals. And, uh they, but it was
a very curious thing because it had the whole hierarchy of a
Roman Catholic urn, program. It had a bishop and uh, a ,urn,
archbishop, and they used , but they weren't allowed to use the
old churches. They had to build modern, uh, modernistic
chapels to hold their meetings in. And so the head of the
Czechoslovak church uh, was down there to meet us, and the
head of our Unitarian Church - there was one Unitarian Church
in Prague - Dr. Chepek(?), who had been to America a number
of times, and we'd met him, was the minister thaL ... he was
there. So we were convoyed to the hotel to uh, and we had
been told by the say a.. ..committee in New York which had
been formed to help the Czechoslovaks just as soon as the Nazis
took the stigma. And it was called "The American Relief for
Czechoslovakia". And their executive director had suggested to
us that we live in a very simple middle -class hotel, because
then people would feel free to come there in numbers and see
us, and they wouldn't feel over-awed, if we'd gone to either of

the big hotels, the Parshish, and the Aleron, where people, uh
Diplomats usually stayed. So we headed straight for the Aleron
as soon as we got there, (SG laughs) and we set up shop in the
Ministry of Health, and uh, we the first person that I met was
Dr. Ellis Masrig, the daughter of the President, whose brother I
had met you see, in the United States before. She was the
President of the Red Cross, the Czechoslovak Red Cross.

SG: And she was a doctor.
MC: And she was, well, she had a PhD. She wasn't a medical
doctor. Uh, the first thing she asked us was "Would you please
take over the distribution of money, uh, for the Red Cross." She
said "The Nazis are already vilifying me, and sending out
broadcasts that I'm taking the money for my own use." And
she said, "I went to the American embassy, and I asked our
ambassador, Will Racar (?) if he would take over.' And she said
he refused, because he said he couldn't do anything as partisan
as that. But she said "Since you've come here to administer
relief, if you'll take over the money, I'll work with you and I
have a wonderful (?) for it, who is the uh, one of the chief men
in the Ministry of Health. A doctor. And I can have him give
you the money and you can spend it."
SG: Then this is for you and your husband, or did you mainly
take over. ..
MC: We, we worked together...we worked together. Then we
began to go ..... Dr. Masrig took me to see all her her children's
homes. One after the other. We'd get into a car and drive out all
sorts of...and it was cold. It was February you see. And it was
very cold weather. .. it's very cold in Prague and covered with
snow. And we went to all these places. I'll never forget one
place we saw. A woman had fifty children in the camp, it was a
summer camp, the children's families ... nobody knew where
they were. And they had one set of clothes that they escaped
them . And this one woman was feeding and washing and
taking care of, and teaching fifty children all different ages, at
once. This was only one aspect. We found hundreds of these.
Everybody in the country and the, the college students had
given up going to college classes, and they were all helping to
make beds in the dormitories . They'd set up in all the college
buildings. There were 128 ,000 refugees who had fled from the

Sedatan(?) land. So it was a, it was a tremendously changed
atmosphere, from what it normally would have been in
Czechoslovakia.
SG: How did you feel during all this? What was gomg through
your mind?
MC: Oh, I tell you we had so much to do, you didn't have to
think about how we felt. And then ....
SG: Were you scared at all, though? Were you frightened that
the Nazis were either going to invade or that you were taking
on responsibilities that.. ..
MC: The Nazis hadn't taken all the rest of Czechoslovakia. We
were in Prague, and they had only taken the Sedatan land, but
we had broadcasts every day that they intended to come and
take the rest of Czechoslovakia.
SG: Were you scared?
MC: Well, I mean what do you do? You just go on with your
work. You got so much to do. You get up at dawn, and you're uh
in a strange place and you have ten people waiting outside the
uh, breakfast room, so you have to hurry up and get your
breakfast over because they wanna see you before you get to
your office. And you get to your office, and the line is around
the building, and down out into the street, and you take
as .... you give numbers, and you take as many people as you can
every day and you try to see people. Or you .... going, one of us
would go on trips and the other one wou Id see individual cases
and decide what we cou ld do to help them, and so on.
SG: Did you and your husband talk during all of this?
MC: Oh sure. We talked all night. We got really ...
SG: Did you ever sleep?
MC: No ... and we did a great deal of travelling, uh, around the
country too. We took turns. But on the fifteenth of March, uh,
the night before ... uh by this time we knew all our friends, who
were working for the refugees, and there were Scotch, English,

Swedes and another group in Prague. There was a girl called
Tessa Rowntree, who was the Rowntree Chocolate family of
England who was a volunteer and she was helping to take
people from Czechoslovakia to England as , supposedly as
servants. And they'd give them ... . the Lord (?) of England, Lord
(?) of London had a committee for it and he raised ... and they
raised the money in England, and these people were brought
right in and taken as servants and then given opportunities to
go other places to work. And Tessa, and we would all confer
every day, because we all had offices near each other. Then the
Nazis marched in and we knew the night before they were
coming, because they'd already crossed into what was free
Czechoslovakia and it was snowing, I think it was about a ten­
inch snowfall, and I'll never forget that night, looking out the
window, and realizing they were moving nearer and
nearer. ... so ....

so:

Did you see them?

MC: No not yet. We got up very early. No, the first thing we did
that night, the night before they came, was to decide that if we
had any papers with names of people. Cheques .. names on them,
that might possibly think that they were being ... the Nazis might
think was someone they wanted, that we mustn't have them In
our possession for fear they would go and get them, and
imprison them. So we took all of our correspondence and we
had all our letters of introduction that we hadn't used or that
we had used. And anything that had anybody's name on it that
was in the country, and went down to the furnace in the hotel,
and when we got down, there, there was a tremendous line of
people all wirh their things to be burned in the furnace. I'll
never forger standing rhere, and watching as they opened the
furnace doors, the flames come up and light everyone, and in
go their papers and they shut it up and then they would move
on. And finally we got up and we burned all our papers .

so:

This is people from all different countries burning ....

MC: You know who they were, they were the people in the
hotel. And it happened rhat one or the, uh, members of the
Czechoslovakian govern men thad arri ved that afternoon from
Paris, and told us what he had heard about the Nazis corning In,
and he went down with us, and he went through our papers

with us so that he could check so that we'd be sure that we
weren't going to injure anybody who was in the country that
the Nazis might try to take immediately. Cause they had people
listed ... they took anybody who was a teacher or a minister, or a
minister, or a leader, or the head of a country, or anything,
anyone who was a leader of any kind, because they didn't want
them to leave any of the urn, groups that might be against
them.

so:

Were you scared for your own life at this point?

MC:No.
SO" Were you thinking about America?
Me: What can you do? The trains have stopped, nothing's going,
it's snowing outside and you know the Nazis are due at dawn.
And on the radio, they keep telling you when they were gonna
arnve.

so:

Did you feel like you were in a nightmare?

Me: Oh no, we didn't worry about it. All we did was worry
about.. .. we got in touch with everyone of the committees. We
all decided what we would do that day, and the...Tessa, we
asked our ambassador, if he would let us bring someone to our
embassy. I called him and asked him if he would let Alice
Masrig go in. He said "Oh no," he said "In the state department I
always gave lectures and said you mustn't give help to any
individuals in time like this." He said" She'll just have to take
here chances. Why don't you go and stay with her Mrs. (?)" .So...
Me: You must not have gotten along very well with him.
Me: Well, he believed in protocol, as he had written in the state
department when he was in the United States, and he wasn't
goin to have any change when an emergence came up. He was
going to stick by the rules. But, the british and the French
began to help. And Tessa, and my husband walked with the
people that were in the greatest danger over the bridge to the
embassy to safety before the Nazis came in . Then we went out,
that next, that first morning the Nazis were there, to watch the
parade. To the (?) which was the great square in Prague, the

great castle. You know, and all the beautiful, old medieval
buildings. And I was standing next to my husband watching
these men with the captails flying .. and all these ... the movies
... the pictures of it. It's incredible to stand there in the snow up
to your knees, and to see those faces and to realize that they
intend to just move in and take over everybody that doesn't do
what they want them to do. And I said something to my
husband in German and at this moment the man next to me
said," Get em you Germans", and I said ''I'm not a German", and
he said "Well, if you're not a German what are you?" I said" I'm
an American". He said "Then speak American, don't speak that
filthy language." I thought he was going to hit me, he was so
angry. And the thought that people ... watching these armies ... the
reich .... Anyway, the first thing to do, was to get in touch with
everybody in the social welfare .... the first thing that everybody
did was they went to the Time Square and laid flowers in the
most beautiful flowers, signifying death to the people. Because
it was how they could show how they felt. Nobody dared to
talk or to say anything, but they went out there. Our minister
was arrested. And that..and then the day of it, we had a
meeting of all the foreign refugeed people. And I went to see
Dr. Ellis. She called me, she was frightened, because the uh, one
group had come already up to the palace of the kings, and she
lived across the street in an apartment house, and they were
smashing her windows, and trying to force the door of her
apartment in. So she said "Martha come quick". So I went up to
her apartment.
SG: Did you walk out In the streets by yourself?
MC: Well, I had do. I mean after all, you can't go if you don't go.
And so ... (SG: That's true) so I took a bus and went to her. .. a taxi
or something, went up to her house, and said ''I'll talk to
Minister (?) and see if we can take care of you."
SG: Were the Nazis outside at the time?
MC: They were allover the city. Everywhere. And they were
going to every corner, and they were goi ng through
everything ... everybody's houses, and stationing people at them,
and putting Nazi flags in all the houses. But the interesting
thing was that, uh, we were able to get more people to the
embassies, the British and French embassy, and I told Dr. Ellis

I'd spend the night there, so that if anything happened at least
I would be there with her when she was taken .. they'd take me
too. Because I couldn't get our, our ambassador to do anything.
SG: How old were you at this time?
MC: (pause) .... '39 ... 1 was born in (calculates) ... 34 years old.
Anyway, so uh, Dr. Ellis stayed until we were able to get her
out, an uh, but, we ... the next day we arranged for her to have
someone stay with her that we thought was alright, and in the
meantime, uh I went down to our office, then I went down to
our office as soon as I had, uh, taken care of her, and there was
just thousands of people waiting outside to get in. They were
frightened to death. The night before, we had been at a concert,
at the Great Opera House, and Dr. Ellis had invited us to go as
her guests and sit in her box. And she had, she had the ... there
was the President's box, but there was a special box for the
Masrig family. And so, I uh, just before we were ready to leave,
we were working at the office so late, she said," Martha, would
you please go and sit in the middle of my box? I can't come.
I've been told that there is going to be an attempt on my life
tonight." So she said, "Just get two more people to take, uh, take
places there." And she said, "Fill up the box if you can. Take
some of your refugees, if necessary. " So we took along some
refugees and put, and in the box ...
SG: Exciting for them ....
MC:
was
hall
next

And every time they had a, uh, an intermission, nobody
down there watching the opera. They were all out in the
talking to each other about what was going to happen the
morning. This was the night before.

SG: How long had you been in Czechoslovakia?
MC: About a week, about ten days .. about the end of February.
This happened, uh, the fifteenth of March. So you see it was ...
SG: Very condensed. Well, you did a lot in a short time.
MC: So, uh, we had already learned a lot about it. Actually, r
should go on with that night at the, at the opera, because it was
really something. At the end of the opera ....... we would be met

by all these ambassadors, and everybody we knew in the
country, and they'd come say, "What've you heard?" And
everybody had heard that the Nazis were coming ... Dr (?), the
president of Czechoslovakia, had gone to see Hitler up in, uh, in
the North and they were having some kind of a discussion. And
uh, so this was all anybody knew. And then suddenly, when
the opera was over, everybody in the audience stood and
shouted "The nation to itself", "The nation to itself". "The nation
to itself". And people .... ran down, and they wouldn't leave the
opera, and finally the opera house people turned off the lights,
so that the only way they could get rid of the audience, was we
all found our way out, and went out into the streets. And the
streets were filled with people that night. This was on our way
home that night before .... when I was telling you we were doing
all these other things. On the way home,.we saw a young
student cutting his arm and sucking the blood out so that it
would be all over the arm. And we saw him run up to a
policeman and show him, and then he said "I've been attacked
by a Czech. I'm a German student". And eviden tly, this was
going on all over the city. They were beginning. This was
before the army marched in. And my husband who never
believed in waiting for anything, ran over to the policeman,
and he said " That guy's a liar. I saw him cutting his arm." And
the policeman said, "Listen Sir., you go away and keep quiet
because somebody might arrest you." (She laughs) (SG: Yeah)
And so, uh, he said to the boy, " Take your lies somewhere
else... and in German, so we could understand the conversation.
But, anyway, then we went to our usual cavana to have a drink
of coffee, on the way to our hotel, and when we got there they
told us tat the place was closed, because the German students
had tried to beat up the Czech students, who were there,
usually there every night. And that finally they'd had to put
everybody out because they were raping up the place. So we
decided we'd better go home. So that's when we were watching
the snow, and we were asked if we wou ld take the people
through the city, and my husband was there to go to the
Embassy with two or three people, and then of course, and we
burned the papers that night. (SG: So this was a long night) A
long night. Anyway .... .
SG: During this whole time you were just gOIng ....

Me: Oh, every minute .... we were only hoping that urn, that we
could .. .I was worried about Dr.Masrig, because she was, she
never was a very strong person, and I was afraid the Nazis
would come and grab her, and uh, and imprison her.
SG: Why do you think you weren't on any of their lists? Any of
the Nazi lists?
Me: Well, I'll tell you about that later.
SG: Okay.
Me: Urn, but then uh, then we uh, we went right on doing our
work. And about three or four days later, I had a telephone call
from Tessa, and, my husband had gone off to see some of these
refugee camps, and take help. And so he'd go off with ... loaded
with stuff for them. And we were working very closely with
the Salvation Army. At that time, some of the refugees were
living in a different bed every night, because they knew that
the Gestapo would try and find the,. And so, I had this
telephone call from Tessa. She said, " lam ... ", this is ten days
after the occupation ... because there was no telephone
operating, except within the country, there were no letters
delivered, no postal service, no outside mail coming in from
anywhere. The television and the radio were jammed, so you
couldn't get any news of anything from the outside world, and
for ten days we were, we were stuck with only the local
broadcasts of the Nazis.about what we were to do, and when
curfew was, and when ... how we wou ld behave ourself. In the
meantime, these thousands of refugees would come and stand
in front of our door, hoping that they could still get out, and we
would give them numbers and tell them to come back,a nd
when their number might be up ... so as not to stand in the
street or be arrested. A nd the first day we came down after the
occupation, we found that the Nazis had taken the desks out of
our office, and grabbed the files, and put everything in the
street, and it's snowing. There was six inches of snow on
everything out there. So immediately, the first thing we did
was try to find a place to have an office, and the uh, doctor
that...l'll never forget he was such fun. One of the heads of one
of the divisions in the Ministry of Social Welfare was also
thrown out in the street. They put everybody out in the street,
you see, so that they could use the uh, the government offices.

So, we were assigned to an old YMCA center. And it had ping­
pong, and all that...basketball and everything in different
places and a few little offices, and we went with the Ministry of
Finance into this marvelous center which hadn't been used
since the americans had left there something like twenty years
before. It was all dusty, and so we set ourselves up, and it was
fun because Dr. (?) who was the head of the ministry of finance
was a musician. And every afternoon at five o'clock when his
work was over, he had five or six friends who came and they
would all play concert for the rest of the evening. Because
everybody loved music.in Prague. And everybody could play
an instrument, and they all go to the opera regularly and it was
really an incredible thing. And so we used to be invited. Of
course we didn't go because we had too many refugees. We
wanted to see refugees until we couldn't stand. And then we'd
go home at about eight or nine o'clock and have something to
eat and go to bed. Well, this continued until I had this
telephone call from ten days after the occupation began, from
Tessa. And she said, "Martha, I have thirty-five refugees, who
are Czechs, and I already have papers for them to go to
England. I have it all arranged. And I, myself, have fifty, and
I'm going tomorrow morning on the first train that goes out of
here - out of Czechoslovakia - since the occupation, and I think
we might be able to get out when the Nazis are not expecting
us. " And she said, "We go to ... we either go to (?), or we go to
some other place. We have to take the train." She said, "I'll give
you the tickets. Fourth -class tickets." And, she said, "You know
we're only allowed to take a dollar and a half of money. And
it'll take about two days to go.And so she, so she said, "Come
down to the train at such and such, and if I get through I'll call
you .. and then you take the next group." And she said,. " They'll
all come out of hiding one after the other, and you check them
off on your list. And I'll give you the list, and then you can
decide whether they're legitimately yours or not.
SG: This is both men and women who are refugees?
MC: Men and women who were Czechs, who knew they were
endangered as far as the Nazis were concerned. Doctors,
lawyers ... people who'd make speeches against the Nazis. People
who'd been fighting against the Nazis.
SG: Was it mostly men?

MC: No, it was both. One of the women that I had was one of
the world's authorities on soybeans. And she wanted to go to
Canada because she had a chance to go and work in one of the
universities there ... in the research universities. And, another
person on my list, was a, one of the most famous surgeons 10
the whole of Czechoslovakia, and he was going, and on a
request to be a house man in somebody's house in
England ...... how long you stay there .... Anyway, so Tessa went
ahead and she got through. She telephoned me and said "Go
ahead Martha." And, it took her almost twelve hours to get
through. So, I went down to the station with my tickets, and
the list that she had given me. And uh, I had sent out the word
the way she told me, to get these people to know that they
were leaving. And an hour before the train they began to
appear one after another, and I checked them off on the list. (?)
and I had thirty-four and we all got aboard this train - fourth
class - sitting on wooden benches, no toilets, no food, and as we
were leaving, I had my allowed amount only of Czech money to
leave ....couldn't buy anything except in Czechoslovakia. And so
we got aboard and the train moved. It moved in the right
direction. But it stopped, and our whole end of the train was
dropped off. I was sure that we weren't going to be able to get
through.
SG: Were you scared for your life at all at this point?
MC:Four hours later, we were hitched onto another train and
we started up again. One of the women in my group had
brought a huge loaf of bread and a huge piece of ham. And she
kept sawing away at this and giving out chunks of food. But
there was no other way we could eat.
SG: Were you afraid at all at this point that the train was gOIng
to get hitched and .... .
MC: Evre we passed a place they looked at our tickets and our
visas. And of course the British visas were perfectly good for
them. And uh, and some of my people didn't get on until other
places outside of Prague. But finally we came to the border of
Poland, the (?).

SG: And you had an amerIcan visa ... Were you USIng a british
one?
Me: No, my own mountain passport. That was ....(SG: Golden)
diamond!!! It was really diamond. And, oh and also, a friend of
mine who we had come to know quite well, had a mother who
was dying of cancer in Paris, and she asked me if I would wear
her diamond jewelry so that the mother could .... so that they
could be pawned in Paris, and the mother could have the
operations she needed. So I was wearing diamond earrings, and
diamond bracelets and uh, it was .. .I really looked like a very
rich american ..... on the train .... with all these people who looked
like they were escaping something. Anyway, we got to the
border of Holland, and the Germans let us go through. When we
arrived on the border. .. the other side of the border, in Holland,
the passport man looked through the passports and he said,
"Mrs. Sharp, these two men from the United Press, and the
Associated Press represent this .... not on your list, and I'm
throwing them off. I'm sending them back to Germany." And
these two men, I'll never forget, got down on their knees and
begged, and they threw off their luggage, and I said, "If you", I
said, "Those two men are on my list, you didn't turn it over and
look on the other side." They said, "Oh no, no, no, you must've
put them there afterwards." I said, "If you make an incident,
I'll take my whole group off, and I'll wire the United States
government, and I'll tell them what you're doing to people like
us who are... have legitimate visas." And so they said, " Alright,
alright. " And they went out and got the men and put them
back on the train, and the train moved on and we went along.
SG: Were you surprised at yourself.. ... that you had
Me: NO!!!!! There wasn't anything else I could do
SG: Not everyone would be able to do that.
Me: Then I was ... we didn't have any food by now, because we'd
eaten it all up in this twenty-four hours.
End Tape 1, Side I

Tape 1, Side 2
MC: ...... first-class passengers. And I said, ''I'm Martha Sharp,
from the United States and 1 have a group of refugees with me,
and we have nothing to eat. Would you mind lending me some
money? I'll give you the money in pounds in England from my
committee, if you lend it to me now.
And the one couple said,
"Of course my Dear, and we wanna entertain you when you get
to London.
And they gave me fifty pounds right off the bat,
until we had enough to eat. Then, that night, we came out of
the train. We actually got to the edge of Holland, where we
were going to take the boat. They didn't.. .. we had to be .... the
departure point had to be changed, because they kept us so
long on the train. We were there almost two days. And when
we... .I'li never forget it because we got off this train, and I had
no (?) and of course the boat was going overnight to London.
And my .... thirty-five people you know, and we hadn't had
enough to eat, we just stretched as much as we could, and we
walked along to the boat, along the key, and suddenly I heard
the captain of the boat, and he shouted out, he said,
Is Mrs.
Sharp there?
He said, "We're waiting for her to come from
Czechoslovakia. Has she made it?" I shouted, and I said, "Yes,
we're here." He said, "Thank God." And we got on board this
little boat. It was, you know, a regular. .. a steamer that went
across from Europe to England regularly every day. We got on
board, and 1· said to him, to the person .... you know we had
fourth-class tickets on the train and we don't have any. We're
just gonna sit up. He said, "My Dear, you're not going to sit up.
Look how tired this people are." He said, "Everybody on here IS
going to sleep." And, at the boat's expense. And they put
everybody in a birth. So we had a birth to sleep In.
If

If.

SG: Did you sleep finally?
MC: I don't think I slept. Anyway, the next morning, we
steemed into the port.. .... Southampton, and there's my friend,
the head of the Unitarian women, waiting for me. She
said ...... and also, the head of the committee, and Tessa
Rowntree. And so the people all got off, and were all checked
with their entree, and I said, "But there's one thing I want
them all to do ... For many of them it was their first trip to
England. I said, "1 wanna take them on a bus ride around
London, before we say goodbye to everybody eJ se." So they

said, "Okay, we'll arrange for it." So they went and ..... so, uh, in
the meantime, my friend Elizabeth said to me, "Martha,you
have no idea how funny you looked." She said, "You haven't
washed your face I can tell, in two days, and you're just
littered with diamonds. (They laugh). She said .. .! said, ''I'm
sorry, but I can't do anything about this." I said, "the diamonds
are to go to someone else." She said, "I figured that". So she
said ..... so she went with us, and we went all around London and
did this wonderful thing and then we went to lunch at.. .. the
Lord Mayor had a special luncheon for the people that his visas
had been given for. And then, they dispersed and went all over
the world to places where they were wanted. And of course
Tessa was great. She went back, and I went back. So then I
stayed long enough in England to collect enough invitations to
tell my husband that I had arrived and London, and that I
would be back on the next train. So then I went back to Prague
through Paris, stopping in Paris with Malcolm Davis, the head
of the (?) to report on everything, and then to start in again.
And then my husband came next time. And also, I went to
Switzerland to the "Institute Pour Les Classements Des
Intellectuels", and collected invitations for these people and left
the names of the .... and took from them, the list of situations
that were available for people and, uh cheques that they would
like to have on teaching staffs, and for certain kind of positions
all over the world. They had a whole area in their uh, archives,
in which they had been collecting invitations for people. And
also I saw the P.E.N Club, which is the international club of
writers, as you may know, and they also said that "We would
be interested in helping bring over. .... " .... name .... they gave me
the list of the leading writers in Czechoslovakia. They would be
happy to bring any of them, and pay their expenses, and so on,
if we could get them out. So then I went back into Prague, and
then we began to work on it. We did this ... my husband and I
going back and forth. I brought two different groups ... another
group also, and worked bringing people out. Another thing that
we did which was the only ..... we had american money, my
husband wore it around his belt. We kept our money in the
American Constable General's file, so we didn't put it in the
bank. Because the Nazis, as soon as they came in took all the
money from the banks . So we still had dollars, and we still had
negotiable funds. And one of the things that we did for
refugees was, many of them could find Clandestine leadership
to take them through Czechoslovakia to the north, and through

the mines between Czechoslovakia and Poland and then they
would travel all the way up to Gardinia (?) on the coast, and if
they could pay in either british pounds or american dollars,
that both fare from Gardinia to London they could make it. But
everything depended on that ten dollars. And we had those ten
dollar bills. And so people would come to us and we'd give
them the ten ... well, after a while, of course, the Nazis found out
about some of these things.
SG: Yeah, I was wondering ....
Me: And the last time my husband wet out, he was not allowed
to come back in. And I was left alone. And then the
other. .. some of the other people were withdrawn, who were
doing relief work ....
SG: Were you living by yourself?
Me: Yeah. In the hotel., doing the work as usual, going on with
all the stuff. And uh, then I had, one of my friends who was a
quaker, and the quakers were the best people in intelligence in
the whole area, he came to me and he said, "Martha we know
that the Gestapo are coming to get you." I was uh .....
SG: How did you feel when he said that?
Me: Well, I, 1 had sort of thought there was something like this
going on, because I had been up to (?) to take some papers and
to get some information from one of the leading people - a man
in (?) who wanted to leave. And uh, I'll never forget it,
because ..... cherries were all hanging heavy on the trees, and we
had dinner outdoors, and we ate fresh cherries off the trees for
our dessert. It was really .. .. And I left the papers, but when I
went back to my hotel that night, and put my shoes out,1 saw
huge Gestapo boots in the next door. And 1 had thought when
had gotten on the train that day coming there, that ... 1 had seen
someone who was following me, and 1 zigzagged and thought I
had shaken him, but 1 hadn't. So, I knew he was there. And
then when 1 got back to Prague I did what I could ....
SG: So you went into your hotel room by yourself and slept that
night?

MC: Yeah, and then I took the train back the next day. I tried to
take, I tried to go from another station. I thought maybe that
would ... but he found me. And then I had word from my
friend .... my friend in the quaker group, that they were coming
to get me on, I think it was Wednesday. And my husband was
out giving a bunch of speeches to the, uh, Unitarian Young
People's International Conference in Holland. So, he was
anxious to have me come out to Holland, if I could make it. So,
um, and Tessa had gone back to England, and there were very
few people left, although I was in contact with the woman who
was the vice-mayor of Prague, who was head of all their relief
work. She used to tall me everything everyday that was going
on. What the Nazis were doing. And everybody else. So, I got
myself a ticket on the train, the day before ... I knew they were
supposed to come and get me, and I went to London, and Paris.
And when I went back there in 1945, I went to the hotel, and
the manager of the hotel looked at me, he thought I was a
ghost. He said, "My God! I thought they got you. " Anyway, so
then I came out, and I was asked by the American Fund for
Czechoslovakia Relief, to lecture all over the United States, to
try to raise money for the Czech, which of course, I did.
SG: Do you enjoy lecturing?
MC: Oh yes. I spent years doing it. And so, I spoke in every, In
every ... all over the place. And it was a very interesting
experience. And, the only trouble was, of course, I hated
leaving my children again, because I went back home, and
every time we left the house from then on they were sure we
were going to be ... not to come back.
SG: Were you in contact with them at all while you were In
Czechoslovakia?
MC: No, we couldn't. ... my aunt would write me every other day.
She was wonderful. She was wonderful, ad she kept our
accounts, and she did all sorts of things for me. But, then her
husband got very tired of the commuting to Wellesley and so,
we went back to our old parish life, and but at the same time,
we both wen t speaki ng allover the place. In between times, to
groups and we'd raise money for Czechoslovakia. And, which
was transferred in various ways to our Unitarians to distribute.
And then, I.. ... the Unitarians decided that they would

now .... because we had gone over, jointly representing the
quakers and the Unitarians. It was a joint committee set up
specially for this. And, uh, the Unitarians , in the meantime,
started the Unitarian Service Committee. And they of course,
asked us to be the first representatives, and could we go the
following May.

so:

Did you want to go back overseas at this point.

Me: I said, "I won't go."

so:

Was it difficult to come back to the United States, and come
back into this calm...

Me: No, because I knew there was so much need. I probably
could get money, and we got clothes together, and all sorts of
things. We did everything we could.

so:

So you weren't much calmer once you got back to the
United States.

Me: Oh no. No. Immediately wanted to help and do everything
we possibly could . So, this was, it was a very difficult period
because of course, we were asked to do so much speaking to
various groups, and we tried to do everything we could. And
we, we'd separate, because each of us had our own story and
that's twice as much if both of us were speaking. So, the
Unitarian Service Committee was formed. They asked us if we
would go. And I said, "No, I won't go. I've been away from my
children. "I was away eight months, you see that year before in
1939. And my husband, uh, went to see Fred Elliot, who's the
president of the American Unitarian Association, and told him
that we wanted to go back to our summer place for the
summer and have a quiet summer with the children. And Fred
Elliot said, "You have no choice . You started something. You
know everybody over there. You can start right out the first
day you arrive. "He said, "A war is going on. Do you realize
that? You can't stay home now. You 've go to go over there".
And he said, "If you don't go, I'll find it very difficult for you to
keep your church, or any other church." Now I think that's a
nasty thing to do. And my husband didn't tell me that. We
went to our annual May meetings at the Unitarian Church, and
I sat down with my husband, and they told during the meeting

of the formation of the new Unitarian service committee, and
they were delighted to announce that (?) and Martha Sharpe
would be sailing within ten days to go back now to France to
see what could be done. I burst into tears. I was sitting down,
because I didn't want to go. And on the way home, my husband
told me that Dr. Elliot had practically threatened him, that he
wouldn't help him in his ministry if he didn't go. So, then we
had to start this thing allover again.
SG: Were you .... Oh gosh, so you went back.
MC: So, uh, to make a very .. .. . in describing how difficult it was
to get ready and to see the french ambassador, and make all
the calls one has to make before one does a diplomatic
thing ... get the visas, go to Washington and get all of the .... and of
course at that time they weren 't giving any visas to anybody,
and they weren't giving your passport "OK" for Europe, 'cause
they didn't want Americans over there. So you always had to
go to the head of the passport division, and she'd say "Fine, this
is great," and so on. So off we went. And we were supposed to
take a, a boat from New York, and we went down to spend the
night with one of our members of our committee, the Unitarian
Service Committee of the National Committee, and he was the
head of(7) House. Wonderful guy. And President Roosevelt
announced that no boats wou ld be allowed to sail from n ow on,
because there ,might be a torpedo. So then the Service
Committee decided that what we'd have to do ... they'd have to
get us a VIP pass, and we would have to go by clipper.
SG: Must have been exciting.
MC: So we flew the day after we were supposed to go, and the
clippers at that time, they were all diplomats, excepting that
we had Whi temore(?) Reed of the New York Herald Tribune on
our trip. And we also had the ambassador who was going to the
Vatican, and his wife Taylor. And, the ... there were two or three
other men, that was all. And we got aboard the clipper, and we
had to cut down whatever, because we were only allowed to
take so many pounds in beautiful weather in July and ...
SG: Were you nervous at all .. in an airplane?

MC: Well, I ended up taking lots of planes, but I'd never been
on a clipper. You know, taking off with those boats, and in
those days, it wasn't at all like taking off on a trans-Atlantic
plane today. Finally we found out.. ... the captain came through
the cabin. He said, "We're not going to be able to go directly to
Portugal as we were planning. " Because Portugal was the only
country we could land in. "We're going to stop at the (silence)
Azores on the way. So, everybody began to talk immediately. I
was sitting next to a man, a dark-skinned man, and he began to
perspire. And he perspired through his shirt, through his coat,
and the perspiration ran down his face. I said," What's a
matter? Are you ill?" And he said, "It's all up ...... " And I said,"ls
there anything I can do to help you?". He said, "No, no, no." We
arrived at he Azores, and the British consul met us, and urn,
they took our bags and our pocketbooks ..... beautiful weather.
They said the weather was so bad that the plan couldn't go.
And we were put up in the best hotel, and then the next
morning we were telephoned, and they told us that the
weather had cleared and now we could go. And they gave us
back our passports and our pocketbooks. And this man was not
given back his passport or his pocketbook. And we were told
that he was a German spy from the (?) Corporation, who was
doing all kinds of things, and it was to catch him that the plane
had been stopped, instead of going directly to Portugal. So ...
SG: Had you had any suspicion of that at all?
MC: He was still sweating. (They laugh) Anyway, but they
didn't arrest him. They just kept all his papers, and he was
absolutely trustful. Anyway .....
SG: Were you one of the only women

In

most of these .... . .

MC: I was the only one.
SG : Did you feel. .. .how did that make you feel?
MC : Well, oh, Mrs. Taylor was there. There were two of us. And
she said to me, "My Dear, all of the things on this plane are
very rudimentary. And she said, "I don't want you to use the
washroom when I or my husband are .. .I don't want you to
corne in, because .... " she said, "there isn't any room for anybody
else but us." So we had to, and he wasn't feeling very well.

They had his secretary on ... a man secretary, and his doctor
were with him, and uh, his wife. She was really very upset that
there was anybody on the plane with them. We finally arrived
at the Azores .... no, I'm sorry ....
SG: Portugal?

MC: No, it wasn't the Azores. What we stopped at was Bermuda.
We went to Bermuda.
SG: Oh, so it was really a quick stop.

MC: Where we came down, yeah. When we finally get to the
Azores, they came down and Whitemore Reed ran up to the uh,
took a long walk up to the weather station to find out 1) If the
weather had been bad and 2) Whether or not ....... and tell his
mother about the German spy that was on the plane. And we
all got back on the plane to go, and no Whitemore Reed. And
the captain said," Well Mr. Reed isn't here. We have to wait for
him. " And Mrs. Taylor said, "Leave him here. I don't have to
wait for him. He said he was going to telephone his mother. He
should have stayed at home with his mother. (SG laughs) So
finally, at this moment, and she kept trying to press the
captain to start the plane and leave, and finally we were
shouting through the dock. He finally came back. And he told
me that he called his mother and told her that the (?) was on
the plane, and what had happened. We arrived at Portugal. It
was absolutely jammed with refugees, and at the dock was the
American minister who was meeting the Taylors who was
going to take them to his horne to rest before they went on to
Rome. Because the Taylors were supposed to be our
representatives for the Vatican. In the meantime, Mrs. Taylor
turned around .... I shouldn ' t really say this, she turned around
and she said to Ambassador Pell(?), this was President Senator
Pell's father, who was the ambassador of Portugal. ... she turned
around, Mrs. Taylor did, and she said,"Mr. Peli, I want you to
take this young man in charge. Mr. Reed has been impeding
everything ...... "( They laugh) And of course, poor. ..... he hadn't
been impedin g anybody, he had just been doing his real job as
a newspaper man. Anyway, Mr. Pell passed it over, and we
were all taken over in one bus, way out to Esto Reel, because it
was the one place where the hotel wasn't full of people,
because the whole city was jammed, and they ... at this point

they had issued that no one could come below Porto, in
Portugal down to Lisbon, because there were so many refugees
in Lisbon, there were no more rooms for anybody to sleep
anywhere around Lisbon. But because we were taken care of
by the Pan American, they took us to the hotel, outside of.. .... in
the Lisbon.

SG: Were you suffering exhaustion at all at any point? Or did
people ask you if, since you were a woman you couldn't handle
all of this travelling? Did people make comments to you?
MC: No. Nobody ever did that.

SG: No? You never had any nasty comments?
MC:No.

SG: That's good.
MC: We uh, it was really very funny there in Lisbon, because
when we arrived we were all put at the same table, and we
had to antique men, who had been buying antiques in the
United Stated to take back to Europe, and we had ..... of course
we had Whitemore Reed and we had (?) who was still around
for a day or two, and we were all put.. .. and there were two
members of Parliament form England who were on the plane
too. And of course they were terribly interested in everything
that was going on, and they were delightful men. And of course
each of these people gradually left when they got
transportation, but urn, and so did Whitemore Reed. But, now
our problem was to try to get up to France. You see, this is the
only was to get to France. So, immediately we urn, went to the
french ambassador, and told him what our problem, our need
was. And so he had a delightful wife who was a spanish
wom,an of a very distinguished old spanish family, and they
both began to work on our problem. And they immediately
invited us to all the things that were going on under the
french .... one of which was a collection of clothes to send up to
France, you see. And so we were going to ... and the first thing
we did was see all our friends. Malcolm Davis arrived down
there from Paris and he'd just been allover France, and had
seen what was happening. And we said, "Malcolm, what do you
think we ought to do in France?" He said, "You'd better feed the

babies. They're all starving to death." So the, the head of the
American church in Paris who is a friend of ours arrived with a
car. He gave us the car.. ... the ford, and he said, ''I'm leaving. I
brought a whole bunch of refugees down. I'm going back to
America, buL .. " he said, " feed the babies." We saw the head of
the Joint Distribution Committee, who we had known the year
before, and he said, The worst thing is the starvation of the
little children." So we decided, we (?O back to America, and we
said, "The first thing ... the money that we spend, or ought to
spend on buying milk. We found out that we could buy
powdered condensed, and dried milk and there, and ship it.
Then we went to all of the railroad companies, and asked if
they would ship it for free to the Portuguese and the Spanish
and the French.
SG: Were you actually gOlOg to these places, or were you
sending people .... ?
MC: NO! We had no people. It was us!
SG: You and your husband.
MC: Yeah. And then we uh, we someone told us what we really
ought to do is to join the Automobile Club in Portugal, because
we couldn't.. .. we were to drive that Ford up to France you see.
And we have to have driving licenses and so on, and they
would help us. So, we went to see the American ..... we went to
see the Automobile Club and I remember there, there was a
woman came in and she said, "Why you look like Americans."
(They laugh). Is that so obvious? And she said, Well, I'm an
American," and she said," I have a cas tle in (?) Town , and she
said, "What are you here for?" We said, "We wanted to become
members of the Automobile Club of Portugal so that we can
drive our stuff up to France . "Oh," she said, "That's wonderful.
Wait a minute." So she called the director to come right in (SG
laughs) and she introduced us to the director, and she said, "
Now you fix them right up. They need to go, and we have to see
that everything's done for them that can be done." This was
Orlena Scoughville of the Scough vi lie Manufacturing company
in Connecticut, who had bought a medieval castle in Portugal
because of its wonderful tiles. She'd written books on tiles. And
she was the leading American in the whole of Lisbon. So then,
she not only did that, but she went to all of the transportation

companies, to get free transportation of the railroads and we
went to the Nestle company, and they said they would sell us
milk on the dock without paying the duty on it, and they would
put it on board free, on the .... things to be shipped out.. ... the
freight cars. And so, we would make ..... and then the
ambassador's wife decided he wanted to send a freight carload
of clothes up there. So she decided she'd put her freight car on
ours .... our milk freightcar. And so this whole thing was
organized. By now, Mrs. Scoughville had decided to help in
every way, and she said, "If you bring the children out, you can
bring them all and stay in my castle when you're waiting for
the boat to go back to the United States. So, we had all these
things arranged in Portugal, and when we got everything
ready, we put a hundred-pound bag of sugar on top of the car,
and we filled the inside of the car with all sorts of things we
knew they wouldn't have, and we started to drive across
Portugal, Spain, and up into France.
SG: I think this story is fascinating to me, but I guess for the
purposes of the tape .....
MC: Make it shorter.
SG: I personally would love to hear about it more and more. Ok,
so .....
MC: So, I'll finish the .. .. . we uh, of course the Civil War had just
ended in Spain and everything was blasted, bombed, the hotels
were not operating, and it was impossible to get
things ... fortunately the (?) held up. We lost a part somewhere
in the grid. But, anyway we finally made the border of France.
And when we got to the border, the guard said, "No,you can't
enter France. France is closed ." And I said, "B ut, you know the
French are more logical to myself. "I said, "Could I speak to the
Common Dock(?) please? All, there were twenty-five or thirty
people wai ting. They'd been there a week, and the border was
closed. They weren't gonna let them go through. So, I called for
the Common Dock, and I explained that we were coming in to
bring milk for the babies in France. And he said, "I am a father
myself. I know how much we need it." He said, "It is illegal for
me to do it. I3ut I will raise the barrier myself, and let you go
through to France. And so e verybody else stood there while we
drove our car. ..... and we didn't realize it was night by now.

France was blacked off. They weren't supposed to have lights
on. We had our headlights on and we drove right.. .. .In the
meantime we had telegraphed, we had sent a wire to our
friends who had left our house in Paris, who had been our
assistants when we were in Prague, and they had come down
to Poe in thee?), and so Don Lowry was trying to ... he had just
organized all the American relief committees. The uh, there
was a big American ship in the harbor, that was about to ..... that
had brought food and clothes for the red cross. And Richard
Allen was their director to direct things. And so Lowry, Don
Lowry wanted us to go to a Poe because the Americans were
not allowed to distribut e anything in any area that was
partially occupied by the Nazis. And the whole border of
unoccupied France had, was split. .. the areas half- german
occupied, and half unoccupied. And, therefore, the places where
they needed it the most, people drove back and you know they
were stopped and sat in their cars, and uh, starved to death.
And the cars wouldn't run because there was no gas. And there
were thousands of people caught this way. So, Lowry knew that
he couldn't get any of the Americans supplies in Poe, and he
and his wife had taken an apartment there before the war. So,
they had come down there. They had six people living in their
two-room apartment. And Americans, and he came to meet us
at the border, at Servere (?). So when we came across the
border to the hotel, he was waiting for us, and he said, "I've
come to beg you to come and distribute your milk. Because we
need it the most." I said, "Well, we have to go and talk to the
head of the Red Cross first." Which we did. He went with us.
And then Richard Allen gave me a permit, I have it here,
showing that r was a representative of the American Red Cross,
and they should help me if they could. And then I went up
with Don, to Poe. Don loaned me his wife for free, and Helen
and r went to see every midwife, and every (?) in the (?) and
arranged for the milk to COme in, and then when the milk
arrived, we had a ceremony with the mayor (and I have a
picture of this) and the rest of it, and the (?) du Departement of
the (?) and that was, and then they began the distribution. And
so, and after that, I was able, through Malcolm Davis, to get the
International Red Cross to send from Switzerland, the same
amount of milk. So that eight hundred babies had milk for the
entire period of the war, because of my distribution. My milk
fed them for two months, and [hen at the end of that period of
time, the Swiss division of the International Red Cross took

over and they used the same people that I organized ... .!
organized all the heads of all of the community, and we had a
meeting and dinner and the heads of the Red Cross, and so on,
and gave them all the responsibilities. In the meantime, I had
been asked before I left New York, if I found any children
whose parents wanted them to come to America, would I
please bring them? So, I had told this in my wanderings, that
Americans were interested because they'd already started to
bring children from England in the early part of the war, and it
had stopped, because Churchill thought it was breaking the
morale of the British people; that they were not fighting for
their children and their families as a group. And so now, the
American committee was hoping they could get some french
children, because then the committee could keep on
functioning . So, what happened then was, I told this to the head
of the Protestant Women of France, when I was around seeing
all the different leaders of the various groups, and she put it in
her newsletter, and it went not only to all the Protestant
churches in France, occupied and unoccupied, but it also went
to them in North Africa. So, the first thing you know, we had
thousands of letters from French, wanting us to take their
children to the United States. So, then uh, after my milk
distribution was gOIng alright and then I made the .. . .. .
SG: This is all 1945?
MC: Yeah, urn hum. This is all one summer. (SG laughs) And
after that was going perfectly well, what I did was I left and
moved down to Marseille, because Don Lowry was no moving
to Marseille for the YMCA, and he was heading up to Czech
relief. Meanwhile, my husband was down in Portugal, he'd
opened an office ... .. he was helping refugees come up, and he
was helping refugees, get us permits so when we sent them
through ........ So, he came up, and uh, I said, "Well, you know, " I 

had the thing all ready to go. A whole boatload of children to
come, and he said, "Well, I have to go back because I've
decided I'm not going to stay in the Service Committee
anymore, so I'm going back to my church opening in
September." We hadn't left until July, you see. So, this was our
summer vacation . So, I said, "Well, I'll stay , but I think we can
get the permits to go through , and it'" be, I'll just stay until I
get these c hildren organized .

so:

Did you want to go back to America?

MC: Of course, but if it could mean that the children would be
able to be saved, some of them their fathers were in
Concentration Camps, and some of them had been lost, some
had been shot, there were all kinds. They were, and so finally
we worked it out. Table-wise, they wanted me to take a certain
proportion of jewish children, a certain proportion of catholics,
a certain proportion of protestants, and a certain number of
non-french children. they wanted a certain group - a cross­
section of the refugees . So, finally to make a long story short, I
worked all that summer on getting the group ready, and then
as we got everything done, I went to see Monsieur Petain (?),
and we had quite a conference, and he said ... .! had to go to see
the Ministere de la Famille, about a dozen times, because they
said "We don't want children leaving France. " And of course
Laval was all opposed to it. And he kept trying to throw every
mickey he could into the works. And I kept going up to (?) and
trying to get.. .. and finally I made it. I don't know anyway, the
french called it a "scandale". I got the head of the ministry of
foreign affairs, and his family interested, and urn, a whole
group of other people. And the said this was a very important
thing, and we mustn't refuse to accept the Americans invitation
for the children, and so they worked it around so that they
forced Laval and Petain to allow the children to leave. And
therefore, I was able to get the exit permissions. After we got
the exit permissions, Petain made an order that anybody who
didn't have a visa to leave France now, would have to get one
from the Oerman Commission of the occupied area or they
couldn't leave France. That meant that everything had to be
reviewed. Six weeks later, the first week in December, I finally
got all the visas again, and we took off, uh, by this time I had
thirty children, and some adults with them, and the youngest
was three, and the ...
. SO : Were you taking care of these kids?
MC: And, no what we did was we got a board a train, and there
were broken windows in the train going through Spain, and
they slept on the floor, and on the benches. The little girl tat
had was three years old had infatiguo, so I kept her on my lap
all the time. And, we had to keep changing trains and finally
we got down to Portugal. This was no picnic . And I had lost my

voice by now. I couldn't speak above a whisper. And finally we
arrived in Portugal, and we had already reservations and
everything, and when we got there they had sold them for an
enormous price. So, I immediately tabled my board member 10
New York. And he went down to the American Express, he
went down to the ............. .! can't quickly think of the boat
company, and got them to free up two recreation rooms, on the
boat, the next boat that was going, and put cots on them, so
that my children could all go on the following boat. And so we
all came to the United States, with Opera singers and famous
pianists, and Czechs - those two were, and the children. And I
had my former secretary from the (?), the YMCA from Paris
who was also Don Lowry's secretary, who had been his and
acting as mine while we were in Marseille, came, we brought
her - she was Russian by background. Her father was a Russian
general, and her mother Madame (?) was with her, and also her
husband and her little boy. We brought them all along to . And
Orlena, who was an absolutely marvelous person, she's been
working at the Harvard Department of Russian Literature ever
since. Orlena helped, and I divided them into groups. And I had
triplets and twins in the group. And we made them into
squads, and each, one of the older children were in charge of
the younger children, and so that's how we made our trip. We
got to Portugal and all the ministers of all the countries that
these children originated in, came down to meet us and they
had arranged for us to stay at a farm in the country and the
children had donkeys to ride, and all sorts of things.
SG: You must have felt wonderful.
MC: I wasn't there. I didn't stay there. I stayed in town,
because I was still trying to get on the next boat. And so finally
we got them on the boat, and we got home at Christmas. That's
the second. Now the other thing, I'll tell you later about some of
the other things. I made ten trips to Israel.
SG: Can I just ask you a question about the beginnings of your
life? Did you ever envision that you were going to be doing
something like this?
MC:No
SG: What do you think gave you this strength?

Me: Well, I was terribly interested in being a missionary. I
wanted to work with foreign people. (SO laughs) And I was so
glad that I had so many years of French and Oerman so that I
was able to talk to them. I was able to use my Oerman with
the, in Israel. I went over to Israel before it was Israel.

so:

What were you doing there?

MC: I was asked by Hadassah to go over and look and see what
they were doing. To take care of the Youth Alliah children. And
then I went all over America and raised millions of dollars for
Youth Alliah. Three hundred thousand children came through
Youth Alliah saved form The Nazi Holocaust, and going to
Israel.

so:

And you're ...... .

MC: I helped raise money all over the country. I spoke at every
Hadassah in the united States, I think, in any big city. And we
really, and of course it was ... you could just feel, I could feel it,
because every time you raised eight hundred dollars, the
British insisted on eight hundred dollars depositive, before any
child could leave on a boat for Israel. That was a time when
they were keeping the (?) back and all those other
things ........ And so, I had a feeling whenever we got eight
hundred dollars, that meant that the children were going to be
leaving. But that's something else, because I became terribly
interested, because when I was in France you see and moving
all over France, I saw what they were doing to the Jews. I
never knew anything about that.
SO: You didn't know anything about that during the whole time
you were I n Czechoslovakia?
MC: Well, I saw ...... . two of my secretaries, those candlesticks 

belong to one of my secretaries ... her mother's sabbath
candlesticks, which I bought from her because she needed the
money. But I saw, in Prague you see, what was going on . And
the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis. Then I saw in France,
and believe me people in France didn't have an ea sy time
either. And so I felt that thi s was perfectly dreadful and
something ought to be don e about it. And so when I came back

and one of my closest friends asked me .. .(we'll keep this for the
next interview) asked me if I would make a speech for
Hadassah. And I guess it was one of my classmates form
Pembroke, who lived in Providence, and she asked me if I'd
come and speak about the refugee children that I'd been
working with, you see. And, in the meantime, my friend in
Boston and I don't know the ZeHa Wyzansky ..... do you know
who she is? The wife of Judge Wyzansky. She was a German
Jew. Her father was the head of the Wyzansky family in
Germany - one of the great bankers of the world. And she
herself, got out of Germany just before, just in time and she
was very deeply involved in helping with the (?) program. And
so she and this friend I'd met in Boston, asked me to have
lunch with them in Wellesley when I got back from the last
trip, and said they wanted to tell me about something. So they
told me about Youth Alliah. And I said, "Why I would have
liked to have started it, if it weren't already going.because it
was taking care of the children, you see, in Israel. So they
asked me if I, so I learned all about what they were doing, and
then Hadassah said I'd better go over and see for myself. So the
year before the state, I went over, ad I stayed with the
Whitesmans, and I went to all the camps and saw the children,
and I've got a picture turning the ... there were two other houses
for the children we had to put up, in the early days. So .. ..
SG: I can't wait to talk about it. I think most of this we can save
for the next interview . I'd just, I'd like to ask you a couple
questions about Pembroke. Did you retain many connections
with your classmates. You said that the Hadassah, that you ....
MC: It happened to be a classmate of mine who asked me to
make this speech, and then another. ... and then when I spoke
once, they said, "Well you'd better change it a little bit because
you ought to know something more about the Jews. And then
this other warbird, and this is Gordon of Boston, who was the
Youth Alliah Chairman for New England asked me to have
lunch with him. And knowing I was a busy minister's wife,
they came to Wellesley to have lunch with me - take me to
lunch. And when they told me about it, I was just thrilled that
there was such a marvelous rescue effort. And if I cou Id do
anything I'd do it. So then I was asked to speak at other places,
and everywhere I spoke, they raised a lot of money. I think
partly because I was a Gentile, you see. Becau se they thought,

"Well, if she says it's good, and she's been over there, and she's
seen them, it must be good," you see. It's very funny you see,
the psychology of the thing.
SG: It's true. I know, I understand what you're sayIng. When
you wound up going to Pembroke after you left Hope
Highschool, was it because you wanted to go to college, or. ..... .
