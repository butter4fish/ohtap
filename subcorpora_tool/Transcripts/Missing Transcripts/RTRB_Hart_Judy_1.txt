We&#039;ll do what we
do, and then we&#039;ll pick it up in New Mexico.

HART: I&#039;m, first of all, delighted you are doing this. I was really glad you
made the extra effort to do this interview, because the last couple of weeks
were so full of emotion. The first four years felt pretty flat on the whole,
with spikes at events and then this rush the last couple of weeks. I don&#039;t want
to get into what I want to say later, but I thought it would be really nice to
do this while there was still this explosion of emotion.

CANDIDA SMITH: I do want to start at the beginning, but maybe before we start at
the beginning, maybe you should say a little bit about how you feel about
leaving the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park after spending four years
getting it going.

You&#039;ve been here in Richmond for four years, and you are about to leave. Maybe
you could say something about how you&#039;ve been feeling since you made the
decision to leave and your assessment of what you&#039;ve achieved.

HART: I&#039;ll start with talking about what happened in the last month. When I was
thinking about leaving and then decided to leave, I had in mind two objectives
that I wanted to finish before I left. One was to come up with a plan for the
development for the Park, which we call the General Management Plan. But in the
case of this Park, where the properties are owned by other people and their
futures are directed by other people, what was important was what they decided
they wanted for the future of their property. I really hoped that would come
together before I left, and it did, in a huge way that just was astounding to
me. The progress, I would have to say, seemed very slow for the first four
years. It felt like what happened in the last three weeks was about the
equivalent of the first four years, in terms of things coming together and
actual movement to get the Park happening. We had meetings with the Park Service
planning team from Denver individually with the property owners two weeks ago.
Then Friday they all came together in the same room for the first time ever.
Every one of them showed up, two or three people from each of the properties.
They shared their visions for their property so that everybody else got to hear
their vision. There were some huge breakthroughs, especially with the city and
Shipyard Three. Everybody got to hear the Port Director with the assembled city
managers sitting there, saying that he would dedicate a part of the Port
immediately for Park uses and would help work with us to find a way to get the
public in there. The SS Red Oak Victory is moving into historic Shipyard Number
Three. A group of people are working together to move the Whirley Crane into the Shipyard.

So all of a sudden there&#039;s this new road that goes all around the Port. It goes
down to the historic properties, and will be signed and interpreted. The Red Oak
Victory will be down there; the Whirley Crane will be down there. It feels to me
like instant Park, after four years of working on it. It was so exciting to
everyone in the room to hear this, because they all understood that this was
potentially the hugest piece of this Park. That&#039;s what would take it to one and
a half million visitors, which they were very excited to hear. The excitement in
the room and the conviviality and the warmth and the eagerness was almost--it&#039;s
going to make me cry a little bit--almost overwhelming, because it was so
different from what the first four years had felt like.

When I got there, every single building was slated for demolition or threatened
by demolition, so to see the change in perspective, but most of all to see the
joint change in perspective and the coming together--it was almost like
everybody held hands and said, &quot;Yeah, we&#039;re going to do it,&quot; even though it was,
I think, all guys. Not that they never do that, but that was really what it felt
like. Or like when the quarterback does his thing and they all clap hands, and
the team goes to play. That&#039;s what it felt like. It was just incredible. The
other thing that I really wanted to do was get the plans for the visitor center
in the Ford Building on the funding list. So, we put on a major crunch to get
cost estimates and Rick Smith did a PowerPoint. We pulled together a lot of
drawings and a lot of impressive information and presented them three different
times in the regional office. I believe that this week the group that&#039;s sitting
to meet and set priorities, I believe they will put it on their priority list
for funding. Or the Regional Director will place it on, one or the other. I
hopefully will know by the end of the week.

Those were the two things that I decided last September. I could feel good about
leaving this Park if those were true, and they happened in a much bigger way
than I could imagine. Then the warmth and the gratitude. It&#039;s making me cry. The
depth of emotion that was coming out of the last two weeks. I didn&#039;t understand
when I started the Park why the City of Richmond wasn&#039;t more excited about it as
a community, as a government, as a communal body. I didn&#039;t understand why they
didn&#039;t celebrate their past, because it was so glorious. I didn&#039;t understand why
they weren&#039;t more excited about the Park. I realized, of course, that they were
distinctly unexcited about the fact that the federal government was not going to
bring in the money to make it happen. I got that part. But, still it was a long
time of just not feeling like I was making any traction. I kept the buildings
from being demolished, and I was very proud of that in the first two years, but
there didn&#039;t seem to be much excitement about it.

Then I began to understand from the Rosies that this was not a particularly
happy story for African Americans. They got good jobs. They, in many cases,
moved to California and had a life better than they had before, but their actual
experience of the war was of prejudice and was an ugly time for them. They got
the worst jobs, the worst pay. They didn&#039;t get the housing; they didn&#039;t get the
child care. They did get the healthcare as far as we can tell. So it was not a
time that they were necessarily instantly wanting to celebrate.

So the feeling in the last couple of months of the excitement about the Park,
celebration of the story, interest, dedication and commitment to making things
happen, the most meaningful part of it to me was that part of it was a kind of a
farewell gift to me, but much deeper than that was embracing their story and
saying that this is amazing what they did in this community; we need to tell it.
We&#039;re the only place in the country that&#039;s worthy of telling this story. We have
these amazing sites that are still here. We can work with them, and they will
become attractions. I think saying that there was a potential of a million and a
half visitors broke through a lot of hesitation, skepticism and doubt about the
Park. That is, of course, dependent on the ferry coming to the Ford Assembly
Building from San Francisco. It will probably be necessary to bring a million
and a half visitors. That seemed to break through the nagging &quot;Why would anybody
come here?&quot; that has so dogged the efforts to get this Park off the ground. Even
if they were excited, there was always a concern of why would anybody come here
and why should this money be spent.

In the early years I would talk about a busload of visitors in a sixty-seat bus.
I would get this &quot;Wow! Sixty people on a bus in Richmond?&quot; &quot;Yeah, more than one
bus actually. You need turn-arounds; you need parking.&quot; The new startle is not a
busload of visitors, but a million and a half visitors. That&#039;s based on a very
extensive study that our planners did of existing sites in the Bay Area. It&#039;s
perfectly plausible, as long as the attractions are there, and the ferry service
comes over from San Francisco.

So, the outpouring brought all of these people working together, the county, the
city, the private owners, this whole range of people coming together, and the
depth of it. Not just that we&#039;re going to do it, but that the history of
Richmond is huge and important, and we really need to tell it. A couple of
people saying to me, &quot;This is the most fun part of my job. The rest of it is
work; this is fun.&quot; So, it seems clearly a good time to leave. I think my
announcing I was leaving did cause a shock to people. Some people actually said,
&quot;You know, I never had to worry about the Park as long as you were here, and now
I&#039;ve got to worry about it.&quot; Yes, that was the message. That was my intention
that that would be the reaction. It is, &quot;Community, this is your turn to pick
this up and make it happen. You now have a plan. Each one of you has a plan. You
have a joint plan. You can make it happen now.&quot; So, the last four weeks have
been beyond what I could have hoped for, really wonderful.

CANDIDA SMITH: We&#039;re going to go into great detail how those four years led to
that kind of conclusion, but right now we should probably go back, some of the
personal story, who you are, where you came from. So, why don&#039;t we start with
where and when you were born?

HART: Oh my goodness. I was born seven days after Pearl Harbor. December 14,
1941. I&#039;ve always wondered about the impact that had on me and my poor mother.
She made it clear that it wasn&#039;t a happy time for her. My father was exempt from
the war because he and his brothers owned a grain company. But he did volunteer,
and I think she probably in her heart knew that that was going to happen. I was
born in Kansas City. I think they stayed there about a week, and then we went
back to Randall, Kansas, which is where my parents lived. It was a little town
in the middle of Kansas. The Hart Grain Company had a series of what&#039;s called
country elevators, including one in Randall. They bought grain from the farmers
and shipped it to the big markets in Kansas City.

When father volunteered we went back east. He spent a year at Harvard, learning
Navy communications. We rented a house. I have the dimmest memories, but I was
told it was quite grand. It was a typical story of the war. Somebody moved out
to make room for two or three military families. My first memories are really
going back to Kansas City. A couple of memories from when I was maybe four years
old. I grew up in Kansas City. A few years ago I went back to the Park that I
remember so fondly, and was struck by the fact that it was not a huge city park.
But when I went down into the ravine and then couldn&#039;t see the houses and the
traffic and so forth, there was this beautiful stone bridge. There was a picnic
shelter, and there were some out buildings. I thought, &quot;This looks like CCC
buildings at a national park.&quot; It looked like a vision of my future.

I went to grade school and to high school in Kansas City. I went to a very fine
high school, Shawnee Mission High School, where they greeted us every morning by
announcing that we were attending one of the three best high schools in the
United States. I went to Cornell with a major in English, without really any
intention of ever working. Or if I did, I would do the Kansas City thing; I
would work until my husband got through law school or medical school, and then I
would be in a nice house and manage it and the children. I did graduate. I went
to the Publishing Procedures Institute at Radcliffe for three months after I
graduated. I think that began to change me. I did really well. I liked it. I
loved being in Boston, Cambridge actually. I loved being there. I got my first
job at Little, Brown Publishing Company and learned a lot. [laughs] I quit my
first job after six weeks. When I went in to quit, somebody else was walking
out; they had quit. So, I took her job. It was kind of a finishing school for
young ladies in Boston. You&#039;d come and work at Little Brown for a year, and then
you&#039;d get married. So, I was on the same track, but just a slightly different
version of it.

Then my second job really, really changed me. I worked for the Boston Safe
Deposit and Trust Company as Editor of the two employee newspapers. I got to
interview the Chairman of the Board and the President and all the senior
officers. I was the roving reporter. This was 1964. Mr. Mainer, in personnel,
was in charge of all the men in the bank. Mrs. Somebody was in charge of all the
women in the bank. I was one of maybe a dozen professional women in the bank.
But, they had me report to Mr. Mainer as my advisor. I had a boss, but Mr.
Mainer was my advisor. I don&#039;t remember anything in particular that he said to
me, but I took myself seriously after two years there. He opened my eyes to see
that I could have a career, that I could do things.

When I talk about Mr. Mainer and the change that he helped me make while I was
at that bank, it reminds me that back at Little Brown many things that I had
read about publishing were true. All the editors were men, and they really would
go to Lock Obers for lunch. It was very eye-opening to me. I realized, for one
thing, I was very naÃ¯ve still after four years at Cornell. They would come back
but in the afternoon they would kind of chat and sit on the phone. The part I
hated--they&#039;d bring the secretary in, and they&#039;d ramble on and on and on and
talk at their secretary for an hour. That was the job. I quit after six weeks,
because it wasn&#039;t entertaining or amusing or interesting. The second man I
worked for at Little, Brown was a designer who managed production for children&#039;s
books. I learned a great deal about design, what things looked like, and how to
present things. It was very educational, how you present things to a six-year old.

In those twelve months that I was there it seemed to me that 80 percent of the
work was done by this fleet of young women like me who&#039;d just gotten out of one
of the seven sisters or the Ivy League. So, we got paid $5,000 a year, and they
got paid hefty salaries. They did things like stand at the front door and write
down what time we walked in, in case we were a minute late. It almost felt like
they locked the door. There wasn&#039;t any possibility of leaving early. I did know
that. The working conditions were okay. I remember they didn&#039;t have air
conditioning, and the mosquitoes would just overwhelm us in the summer.
It--really, for the first time--opened my eyes to this notion of who gets paid
to do what, and who really does the work. Education and background and
opportunity all were just sitting there in my face on a daily basis.

Then I started this job at the bank, and I got to talk to these amazing Brahmins
from New England. I still have the greatest admiration for their very grand
spirit. Ralph Lowell was still with the bank, and I admired that man so much. I
just took in that spirit of how much one person could do. The bank was doing two
things then. They were quietly meeting, I was told later, to plan the future
Boston. There were five banks that were behind the urban renewal that happened,
and the dramatic new architectural spine created in Boston. They were massive
changes that I still think are admirable and good. They, also in 1964, hired the
first woman trust officer. They hired me. They had young African American girls
as clerks when you walked in, at the counter when you walked in. They were
actively promoting professional women and equal opportunity, years before anyone
else in Boston was publicly doing it.

One piece of my job was to train these new young clerks how to balance a
checking account, because everybody in the bank got a free checking account. So,
I worked with them, and I created a training course to teach them how to run a
checking account. It was a very interesting experience for me, in terms of
learning how to communicate with people--the essence of this course I took at
Boston University was called &quot;Programmed Instruction.&quot; You just rewrite it and
rewrite it and rewrite it, until everybody who takes this test in the training
manual gets the right answer. It was fabulous discipline in how to communicate
with people. Plus working with these young women.

By the time I left the bank after two years, I really didn&#039;t know where I was
going, but I was very different. I had decided that I wanted to work for the
Boston Redevelopment Authority, because they were what was happening in Boston
at that point. I really admired what they were taking on. I remember thinking,
that if I was going to work at all, I wanted to do something that mattered. I
would sit there at my desk in the bank thinking, &quot;I have this wonderful job in
this fabulous bank. I&#039;m the envy of many people in the world, but I don&#039;t think
it really matters all that much to me. It&#039;s not making much of a difference in
the larger world.&quot; So, I took the summer off and then went to Europe for four months.

I remember Twiggy was the thing then. I went to England. I went to London
mostly. It&#039;s funny; I had my conservative clothes and my conservative way of
thinking about things and didn&#039;t become a part of that Twiggy culture. I really
didn&#039;t get to see much of it, but still a girl from Kansas living in London for
a while was eye-opening. I had done, literally, one of those thirty-two
countries in ninety days, or whatever it was when I was in college. But this was
very different, being on my own. I spent a week in Paris on my own, which was
even more different, because I don&#039;t speak French. So, that was another eye-opener.

When I got back, I did all sorts of things to make a living, to get by. I used
to go to Filene&#039;s and charge clothes on my Filene&#039;s account and then take them
back the next day, because I could get cash. [laughs]. That was a thin
existence. I painted friends&#039; apartments. I did sewing. I did some temporary
jobs, which were actually quite interesting. I worked for Bolt, Beranek and
Newman [now called BBN Technologies] for a while and worked for these people on
a grant that were researching the French system of total control of industry,
where the government tells you that you get this many trainloads of lumber and
this many trucks full of this liquid, and you will make this much stuff. It was
a similar to what we did in this country during World War II, which was actually
quite interesting. So I went about eight months, I guess, just patching together
a living and being on the other side. I was living in a lovely apartment, but it
was also eye-opening for five dollars to mean so much at that point.

I finally got a job with the Boston Redevelopment Authority doing relocation
program development. They were relocating thousands of families from the
hardcore African-American community in Boston. My particular piece of it--I came
in after the huge, massive work had been done. Lyndon Johnson, before he got
elected, his campaign promise was 1200 units of new housing in Roxbury in six
weeks, Roxbury being just one inch away from the very toughest part of the
African-American neighborhood. I was the Assistant to the Director, and we hired
four welfare mothers to do the administrative work, two young college graduates
to be the supervisors and four additional recent college graduates as field
staff. We had, I think, thirty-five volunteers from a prep school way out in the
suburbs and six welfare mothers that were field staff and about twenty
volunteers from a church out in the suburbs.

The incredible collection of women volunteers from a suburban church, the young
men from a very prestigious prep school way out in the suburbs, and a group of
welfare mothers and four college graduates were the field staff that went out
and interviewed these 1200 families. Usually they went in pairs, but it was an
incredible project. We were blessed that no one got hurt. In hindsight, it&#039;s
kind of amazing that we did it, but we did. We interviewed every family, and
eventually 67 percent of them got to move back into the newly rehabbed housing;
all were relocated to housing appropriate for them. It took four years, not six
weeks. Six weeks would have required that they all be kicked out on the street
on day one. It was eye-opening, to say the least. The developers and the Federal
Housing Authority and my boss would meet once a week in these screaming matches,
because the developers thought they were on a six-week track, and we had
actually gone--I had actually written all the papers to get the money from HUD.
HUD funded the relocation, and FHA funded the rehabilitation. So, FHA and HUD
were at each other&#039;s throats. The developers were at everybody&#039;s throats. We
kept saying, &quot;You can&#039;t throw these people out on the street.&quot; I learned a very
different view of the world by working on that project and was totally committed
to helping those families get back in decent housing.

That was the year that Martin Luther King was shot. That was the year that Bobby
Kennedy was shot. We didn&#039;t work for a few days because our boss was afraid to
have white girls driving back and forth even to the office. That added a lot of
extra intensity to it. It was a real gift to me to be able to do that project.
It is still a highlight of my career, what I did on that project.

I went from there to working for the state; by then I was hooked. I loved public
service. I loved working for the government, and the change that was able to
happen by having that kind of position. I went from there to being in the
Relocation Bureau of the Community Affairs Department of the State of
Massachusetts. It was the same kind of job, but on a statewide scale. There was
a state relocation law that required that if public funds were used to acquire
property, people could not just be thrown out on the street. There had to be a
study of their needs, documenting that adequate housing was available for them,
and they had to be given services. So, we went all over the state. As it turned
out we went all over the state, stopping projects or slowing down projects and
saying, &quot;There&#039;s no place for these people to go. You can&#039;t throw them out.&quot;
We&#039;d work with them and figure out solutions to things, which invariably meant
greatly slowing down the projects, and once in a while stopping them. I did that
for two years, and then my boss left.

When my boss left, my big boss told me they were going to do a nationwide search
for my Bureau Director and that they were really looking forward to me training
him. [laughs] I remember my big boss, who was the Deputy Director for the
Department, taking me to lunch and telling me about this and how important it
was and how much he was looking forward to me working with the new person to
train, who hadn&#039;t been picked yet. He was just telling me about the nationwide
search. I don&#039;t know where it came from. I had no intention of saying this. I
had no idea what we were going to be talking about at lunch. I said, &quot;Well,
that&#039;s very nice, but I need to tell you that I&#039;m leaving.&quot; [laughs] I don&#039;t
think he finished his lunch. I meant it. I wasn&#039;t going to walk out that minute.
I said that I would stay a couple of weeks after the new person came, but I was
leaving. I don&#039;t remember how long it took, and I don&#039;t remember if I competed
for it. It&#039;s funny that I don&#039;t remember much about it, but they decided that I
should be the Bureau Director. I said, &quot;Okay, that&#039;s fine.&quot; I did that for two
years. It was immensely satisfying.

To put this in context, our state office building had buses in the building
garage almost every morning, full of police waiting to deal with the protests
that were happening in front of the building. This was 1968, &#039;69, &#039;70. I don&#039;t
remember what in particular they were demonstrating against. It was just a time
when there were always hundreds of demonstrators in front of the state building
and the federal building across the street.

I got sent to Cape Cod to try and develop subsidized housing, one of my favorite
projects of my career. The National Welfare Rights Organization [NWRO] came to
Cape Cod for their national project, and they had a few hundred college students
who went to Cape Cod to picket and protest and demand better housing for the
largely African Americans who got evicted from their homes every summer, because
they could get more rent from the summer visitors. So I was sent down with a few
hardy people on the staff to deal with it. Again it was an amazing experience. I
had great admiration for the NWRO people. I thought they were honest and
committed and dedicated and intelligent people who were trying to make a
difference in their own way. We had lots of really good conversations and lots
of happenings, like they would picket the Holiday Inn where we stayed. We
stopped staying overnight. It did get to be a little bit unpleasant. We did get
a few dozen families in subsidized housing, but more importantly we got an
understanding of the issues and the needs that these people deserve better
treatment. They would camp in the woods the whole summer, sleep in cars and so
forth. I think the biggest impact we had was saying to the town people, &quot;These
are perfectly reasonable demands. You may not like the style of the NWRO people,
but the demands they are making are perfectly reasonable.&quot; I loved that
assignment. I really had a good time with it and learned a lot.

I also did most of the research and writing, most of the documentation when a
huge privately-funded urban renewal project was proposed for downtown Boston.
Mortimer Zuckerman was on his rise. It was before he was as famous as he is now.
He proposed taking over I think about twenty blocks on the not-so-nice side of
the Public Garden and the Public Common and was going to build, I think, ten
fifty-story high-rises, just a humongous development. Boston Public Garden with
all of its flowers would have been in shade almost all day if his project had
gone through. It was not well funded. The developer wasn&#039;t really putting that
much money in. The city was really going to be bankrolling it. I did the
research on the relocation and said, &quot;There&#039;s no way you can say all of these
businesses and very low income people would have a place to move to if you
demolished this whole neighborhood that&#039;s housing them.&quot; The Governor took our
side and supported us. That was Governor Frank [Francis William] Sargent, for
whom I had great admiration, a classic Brahmin, just out to do good, as far as I
could tell. He took our side.

We had one very dramatic meeting with the developer where he seemed to think we
were going to have a chummy &quot;this is wonderful,&quot; and instead the Commissioner
said that we rejected it. It was a very tense time after that. About 20,000
union laborers demonstrated at the Statehouse one day. The Governor came out and
met them. But, the rejection stuck. It didn&#039;t happen. It never went through.

After that job, I went to work for the Federal Highway Administration. I was the
first professional woman in relocation and land acquisition. So far, I had been
the first woman ever in two jobs.

CANDIDA SMITH: I&#039;d like to ask you whether you were developing a feminist
consciousness during this time. Were you part of a consciousness raising group?
Did you join NOW? Were you reading [Simone] de Beauvoir or [Betty] Friedan?

HART: No, none of those things. At that point, as far as I remember, it was
completely personal. It was like peeling off the layers of myself and saying,
&quot;Well, I can do this.&quot; [interview interruption] It was like peeling down the
layers of myself and going deeper into me. I certainly wasn&#039;t doing anything
organized, and I wasn&#039;t reading any of the literature. I was just looking around
at the world. I think part of that is the world I grew up in was so homogenized
that it was years of just noticing the world around me to make sense of it.
Mission Hills was essentially a planned residential development in which I could
drive an hour and be in the same beautiful setting with lovely streets, lovely
houses, flowers in the corner islands, because it had been planned by one
developer. I knew the universe was not like that, and not like my high school
where everybody went off to college after graduating. So it was still a
Judy-gets-to-know-Judy and Judy-gets-to-know-the-world at that point.

The next job it began to change. I was hired as the first professional woman
staff in relocation in the Federal Highway Administration. Until then, I had
always had running buddies--people that shared my commitment. We were different;
we did different pieces of it, but we shared the commitment to make something
happen. I was on my own there. I was in charge of reviewing the environmental
impact statements for economic impacts and relocation and social impacts. That
was at a time when the agency still didn&#039;t accept that NEPA applied to them.
They were building good highways. NEPA wasn&#039;t for them.

CANDIDA SMITH: What is NEPA?

HART: National Environmental Policy Act, that required you write environmental
impact statements prior to your federal actions. It was new. The Federal Highway
Administration guys seemed to me to really believe that everything they did was
good. All of a sudden I was sitting there in these big meetings, saying, &quot;This
analysis isn&#039;t adequate. It doesn&#039;t say anything. It&#039;s not accurate. The studies
aren&#039;t going to cut it with the public&quot;. I had been around the public enough at
that point to have a pretty good idea what would cut it with the public. That
was at a point in FHWA history where they had finished most of the interstate
highways and all over the nation had gotten close to the major cities. And they
wanted to finish their highways and bring them downtown, and they were being
stopped all over the country There I was, saying, &quot;This isn&#039;t going to make it.
You&#039;re going to go down if you publish this piece of work.&quot; It was a very
unpleasant three years there, lightened only by the fact that Frank Mahady, who
had come to work with me as an intern at the Community Affairs Department when
he first got out of Harvard, had become the head of relocation at the state
highway department. So we were working together and actually managed to make a
lot of changes, but my office felt very hostile.

That&#039;s when I began to think on a more programmatic level. I was very conscious
of being the first professional woman in that office and very conscious of how
the agency tried to deal with that. FHWA was a very well run agency. I was very
impressed with them. They had review systems and back-up systems and appeals
systems, most of which came into play in my three years. The Chief Engineer was
the head of the office, and he was a wonderful, wise, distinguished sort of
Brahmin sort of a person, who in my opinion had a large vision. He knew that
what I was doing was helpful to the agency in the long run. He was very
protective of me, but it was eye-opening.

I remember sitting at my desk there one day, looking through the federal
telephone book. I looked through this little federal directory, and I found a
listing for the National Park Service, and it had six names under it. I read it,
and I looked it for the longest time and thought, &quot;I bet they&#039;re nicer people
than the people I&#039;m working with here.&quot;

But instead what I did was quit and get a Master&#039;s of Arts in Law at a school
without walls. Goddard College in Vermont was running a Masters of Arts in Law
program in Cambridge, and it was again just pushing my life out to the
boundaries. We sat on the floor on pillows. There were five people in my
program. The fellow who taught it was a free spirit, a brilliant lawyer who left
that program to teach the philosophy of law at Harvard Law School.

CANDIDA SMITH: So how is that different from a JD program?

HART: [laughs] I don&#039;t think they sat on the floor on pillows. I don&#039;t think
their classmates looked like mine. We did things like go down and meet with
prisoners. One of the most amazing things that we did--the assignment was
simple--sit in city, state and then federal court for a whole day. Just sit
there and watch. It was astounding. The program core was social justice. Lee
wanted us to understand that it was African Americans that you see in the court
system, whites on the bench and African Americans in the chair. And then going
down to a prison to meet the folks who actually end up in prison. We studied the
Cuban legal system, the Russian legal system, and we learned how to do legal
research, and we had passes to go to the Harvard Law Library. So, it was this
experience of just stretching me and all of our minds about as far as you can,
all at the same time. I wrote my thesis on a topic that I had come to feel very
strongly about when I worked for the state: the three-legged stool. The idea is
that if you really want to change something huge like stopping highways and
changing relocation programs and changing benefit programs, you need somebody on
the inside of the bureaucracy who is sympathetic, and you need a strong
community protest group, and you need professionals on the outside.

While I was in this degree program, my field project was to work with a group of
people from the Mission Hill district, I guess they called it, which was on a
hill right next to five hospitals. Harvard had a hospital; B.U. had a hospital,
I don&#039;t remember all of them. All of them were in the same neighborhood over a
few blocks. They were going to build a--what did they call that? It was a
heating, cooling, generating, and incinerating plant, so that all the hospitals
had tubes so that they could put, as we often said, dirty diapers and body parts
in the tube at the hospital. It would all come down to this one common
incinerator and go up this one common stack, which happened to be right about
the level of the houses in this low income neighborhood that was downwind from
this project. So, I got to start demonstrating. I was out there marching with
this little group in a couple of demonstrations they did. I also organized them
to go and meet with the state EPA and say that this environmental impact
analysis Harvard has written is superficial, and wrong, and listed all the ways
they were being misled by Harvard&#039;s impact statement. One highlight of that
meeting was showing the state officials pictures I had taken the day before,
with huge clouds of almost black dust in the air as their demolition of housing
began. Clearly, Harvard was violating their commitment to water down the
demolition and prevent dust in this residential neighborhood. The state rejected
the plan. Harvard didn&#039;t get to build that cogenerating plant, which I thought
was a really good thing for the world. I did not think that burning body parts
and diapers to turn it into heat and then spewing that over the neighborhood was
a good idea.

By this time, I was even more hooked. There was a change someplace in that year
where I thought very clearly, &quot;I&#039;m tired of stopping things. I&#039;ve spent years
now stopping really, really bad things, in my opinion. That&#039;s very satisfying,
but I&#039;d rather start things.&quot; When I finished the degree program, I applied to
the Park Service, got a job, was on the payroll within four weeks, and started
doing land acquisition and relocation for the Park Service. I did that for about
two years, did some really interesting work, relocated four or five families out
of Eleanor Roosevelt&#039;s home, and stopped the eviction of the eighty-seven year
old former owner from Martin Van Buren&#039;s home. I&#039;m like, &quot;I think we can resolve
this a little better.&quot; It turned out there was a gatehouse. He moved into his
gatehouse. He was happy as a clam. He lived there for another five years, and we
restored the big house.

Then a job came open that was my dream job. It was legislation for the Park
Service in Boston creating new national parks. So, that&#039;s what I started doing
for--I had that job for four years. I found it incredibly satisfying to help in
the creation of new things.

[interview interruption]

CANDIDA SMITH: So, you wind up in an office of legislation. You&#039;re the person
who&#039;s drafting the legislation that is then submitted to Congress for parks in
the northeast region?

HART: I was in the Planning Office in the Boston regional office. I often went
to communities--I was sent out to meet with every community that wanted a
national park. So, in many cases my job was to say, &quot;This isn&#039;t going to work.
This is not going to be what you want. It&#039;s not going to work as a national
park.&quot; I basically said no to a great many places.

And then I was asked by the Washington office, &quot;What do you want the Denver
Service Center to study for new parks?&quot; The Denver Service Center was our big
formal office for planning and design. They would come in and do a study. At
that point we were submitting twelve proposals for new parks a year to Congress.
It was very, very different from where we are today. We were actively looking
for new nationally significant stories and sites then. I looked at what was
cooking around in our region. It was a general&#039;s home. The first three or four
people I asked didn&#039;t know which war he was in, and I had never heard of him. I
thought, &quot;We can do better.&quot;

I had read our Index to National Parks, which was a book we published for the
bicentennial. It divided all of the national parks into categories. They
included Civil War parks, Presidents&#039; parks, natural parks. I think there were a
dozen categories. The Park Service put out a nice little book, and on the very
front page where it had all of these categories, there was an asterisk. It said
&quot;African-American history is incorporated into all of the above Parks&quot;. What
really struck me was that there was no asterisk for women. We didn&#039;t even get an
asterisk. [laughs] I thought, &quot;This is going to change. This is ridiculous.&quot;

This was 1978, and my title was Chief Ranger for Legislation. It took a year and
a half for me to get the job--including the beginning of a discrimination suit.
Finally the Regional Director said that I was supremely qualified for this job,
having a Master of Arts in Law, having written legislation for the state and
lobbied for it, and having implemented big changes in legislation at the state.
He said that since my job was to implement laws, why weren&#039;t they hiring me. It
took a lot to hire a woman in 1978 for what was considered one of the plum jobs
in the regional office. But I did get it. That, of course, flamed the fires in
my soul quite a bit, what it took to get that job.

So I said, &quot;I think we should have a park having to do with women.&quot; I had a
brand new boss, Terry Savage, the Chief of Planning, who had just come in from
San Francisco, and he had just driven across the country. He was still in a
motel. I telephoned him before he even got to the office, because I had a
deadline to answer Washington. He was like, &quot;Cool.&quot; So, I went looking for one.
I said, &quot;We should have another one for African Americans, as well as one for
women.&quot; I proposed we study what became the Women&#039;s Rights National Historical
Park in Seneca Falls and what became the Boston African-American National
Historic Site, which was the first freed black community in the country. I
worked on those for the next two years. What a thrill. The African-American site
was--I really went looking for it. I found it. I found a fellow who was trying
to promote the idea, all of the properties. It was on the backside of Beacon
Hill. He was trying to promote the idea of the park, of the history, but I
actually got it turned into a Park. It&#039;s open to the public now. And Women&#039;s
Rights NHP became a huge deal. Stories about that go on forever, starting with
the name of it. The traditional Park Service name would have been the Seneca
Falls National Historic Site. I said, &quot;No, it should be a national historical
park, because the story is so important and there are several different sites
there. And if you say the Seneca Falls National Historic Site, nobody but
thirty-five women will know what&#039;s there. If you don&#039;t tell people it&#039;s the
women&#039;s rights site, no one will ever know.&quot; Well that argument went on for
years, including the two and half years it took the legislation to go through.
It was a pretty hard fought fight.

CANDIDA SMITH: Within the Park Service?

HART: Oh yeah.

CANDIDA SMITH: Was it pro forma in Congress or was there opposition there?

HART: It was easier in Congress than it was in the Park Service because Senator
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, for whom I have the greatest admiration, became its
champion immediately. The local Congressman wouldn&#039;t sign the proposed
legislation; he said that we couldn&#039;t do guns and butter at the same time. So,
Congressman Jonathan Bingham from New York City signed the House bill. But,
Daniel Patrick Moynihan just came in on a white horse and just blew the stuff
out of the opposition. The Chief of Staff for the House Resources Committee,
Dale Crane, our substantive committee, as opposed to our money committee, loved
the Park and became a very good friend. So, between the two of them--no, I&#039;m
missing a very important piece of it, a very important person, as I think more
about that.

I proposed we study it. I went to Washington. I went to The Park Service Denver
Service Center. Denver replied that it&#039;s not big enough. It&#039;s not complicated
enough. My boss, who had just come from San Francisco and by this time was
really interested--we had gotten connected with the local people, and they were
tremendously excited--and he said that we&#039;d do the study there in the regional
office. So I worked on the study with another woman who opposed the idea; it was
her determination that there would never be a national park in this community
because she said the winters were too harsh. We got the study finished. The two
of us had many battles, but Terry Savage always intervened and generally agreed
with me, and we got a good study done.

The regional office study was sent to Washington, and it got sent to Denver. The
Denver Service Center did not recommend it being sent up to Capitol Hill for a
proposed new park. In those days we were allowed to promote new parks. I had
been to Washington a lot. I talked it up a lot with everybody I could find. I
had been up on the Hill, giving slideshows. The Director had heard about it from
our Washington liaison Peggy Lipson. And Director Bill Whalen, in the big
meeting where the Denver folks presented the park proposals to be sent to the
Hill, he looked at them all, and he asked what&#039;s happened to Women&#039;s Rights? I
kept hearing about Women&#039;s Rights. It&#039;s not in here. Denver folks said they
didn&#039;t include it. Director Whalen told them to go find the study and that it
was going to the Hill. So, he sent it to Congress. By then folks on the Hill
knew about it, because I had been given a very long leash to promote this idea,
because my region was really behind it. Senator Moynihan was already aware of
it, and the House side Chief of Staff Dale Crane was excited about it. So, all
they had to do was get it to the Hill, and Senator Moynihan and others carried
it from then on. I don&#039;t even remember what our testimony was like. It was
pretty lukewarm as I recall. Several folks from Seneca Falls came to Washington
for the hearings, and their enthusiastic testimony was important.

I actually got to write the legislation. It got watered down in Washington by
the Park Service, and there were lots of fights about it. They kept wanting to
keep the costs down, was what they said. I was trying to model it after Lowell
and have a Commission and two different ways to spend money and have a
non-profit segment and a Park Service segment. That all got cut out. The Park
Service chopped the legislation in some really significant ways.

It did survive with its name--Women&#039;s Rights National Historical Park. It got
authorized. Actually Senator Moynihan had to pull it out of a hole. It went
through the House lickety-split and was passed by May. It got set aside in the
Senate, and in the middle of December at the end of the two-year congressional
term, Senator Moynihan fished it out of the pile and said that they were going
to pass this. And got it passed within a week. President Jimmy Carter, with a
broken collarbone, signed it, I&#039;m told, on his last day in office, because of
course we had had a significant shift in the administration. We went from Jimmy
Carter to Ronald Reagan. The fear was that if Jimmy Carter didn&#039;t sign it, it
wasn&#039;t going to happen because the congressional session would have been over.

It did get signed. The administration had changed. I had put all of my new parks
in for a $400,000 first-year budget, and they had all pretty much gotten it.
Women&#039;s Rights got funded at $5,000 in its first year.

CANDIDA SMITH: Does that include salaries?

HART: [laughs] Yes. However you want to spend it. We had total freedom. I used
the money to go out to Seneca Falls once a month and keep up the local
excitement. I was the Park Coordinator; that title and work was added to my job
as Chief Ranger for Legislation. Then at the end of that year, they decided--I
decided, actually, with a lot of anguish about it; I had no intention of moving
out there and starting it up. But by then the new administration was well
entrenched. The lists were circulating all over the Hill, all over the country
of parks to be deauthorized. At the top of the list were parks that didn&#039;t own
any land. The Park Service didn&#039;t own anything yet in Seneca Falls. I thought,
&quot;With this name and no land, and we have nothing firm for the future, this Park
is going be the first one to go.&quot; So, after a lot of soul-searching, I decided
to leave my much-beloved Boston and legislative job and go out and start up
Women&#039;s Rights. My first job there was to persuade the local non-profit group to
purchase the Stanton House, and then the group would donate the title to the
Park Service. I said, &quot;I know this is a huge sacrifice. You all worked four
years to raise the money to buy this Stanton House. This was to be your way to
make your name. I understand that. But this Park isn&#039;t going to happen if you
don&#039;t give the house to us, so that we can say, &#039;We own something. We&#039;re
restoring it. This is real. There&#039;s a person out there. This is not a Park you
are going to shut down.&#039;&quot;

So that was how I ended up at Seneca Falls. Starting on the very first day when
we cut the ribbon with Alan Alda for the new visitor center, we started the
rehabilitation of the Stanton House. I of course was looking to put real legs
under this Park as quickly as possible, which is why Alan Alda came to cut the
ribbon, and five thousand people were there to watch him. So, it was not
something the administration could lightly close up.

CANDIDA SMITH: You had mentioned on the phone to me a few weeks back that unlike
the Rosie Park, you never had any doubt that there would be the Women&#039;s Rights
Park, once you arrived. I wonder if you could explain what your goals were as
you established the Women&#039;s Rights Park, what are the key milestones you had to
achieve that would allow you to say, &quot;Now, we have a functioning Park the way
I&#039;ve envisioned it.&quot;

HART: Women&#039;s Rights was so much easier than Rosie in Richmond even though the
legislation was a fight, keeping substance in the legislation was quite a fight.
I lost part of it, but I kept the traditional part of it, which was that the
Park Service would own and restore and interpret the primary historic
properties. In Seneca Falls that was the Wesleyan Chapel, where the first call
for women&#039;s right to vote went public, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton house, of
course, the McClintock house where they wrote the Declaration of Sentiments, and
the Hunt house where they first had the tea party and decided to call the
convention. So, that was a straightforward Park Service kind of thing, with
these clearly nationally significant--clearly once Congress passed the
law--clearly nationally significant sites. Restore them, and tell the story.
That was all outlined in the legislation.

By the time I moved to Seneca Falls I had been coming to the community for two
years on a regular basis, three years really. It was a small town. There were
three thousand people in the village and ten thousand in the town. So, I knew
all of the reigning figures, all of the significant players in town, and they
were very excited about it. While it was controversial, there was never any
doubt that the Park Service was eventually going to own all of those properties.
It was a question of when and under what circumstances, how much money would we
pay, but everybody knew we were going to own those properties. The Park Service
knew we were going to restore them and tell the story. So, I had that behind me.
I had a very, very deeply committed Regional Director who was the first
African-American Regional Director, and I walked on water with him, because I
had created out of nothing, the Boston African-American National Historic Site
and gone and found the Women&#039;s Rights site, before he was there. He could not
have been more passionate about getting both of them off the ground and
flourishing. He saw the potential for a breakthrough success at Seneca Falls.

CANDIDA SMITH: What was his name?

HART: Herb Cables. He was a fascinating guy. I learned a tremendous amount from
him. For years, the whole time I was in Seneca Falls, in a really tight spot I
would just stop for a minute, and I would ask myself, &quot;What would Herb say about
this? What would he do?&quot; He was a professional athlete before he got into
recreation. He loved horse racing. He said to me I bet horses, and I pick my
winners, and then I give them everything they need. You&#039;re a horse that&#039;s going
to win this race, so you&#039;ve got my support, whatever you need, which makes all
the difference in the world. There were a couple of hundred highly professional
people that I had been working with already for three years in the Boston
regional office, who were all excited about the Park, and with his support
behind me there was no stopping me. The community was the same way. The
community leaders were totally in favor of it. It certainly wasn&#039;t easy. The
owner of the Wesleyan Chapel was running a laundromat in the front of the
building and a parking lot and automobile repair in the back and ten apartments
up top. As the laundry machines would break down, the owner would put a sign on
each machine, saying that it was broken and because of the Park Service it was
not going to get fixed. [laughs] So, during my tenure there, slowly, many of the
washing machines had a sign that said that because of the Park Service, you
couldn&#039;t use this machine anymore.

CANDIDA SMITH: Because you were planning on buying the property? Did that mean
the owner could not sell the property?

HART: Essentially it did. It did take us probably three years to buy it.
Lightening speed by today&#039;s standards. It was difficult for him.

CANDIDA SMITH: It was a question of negotiating the price?

HART: Unfortunately, no. It was time. The government hires a contract appraiser,
and there&#039;s no negotiating ability, so that price is take it or leave it. Since
he really couldn&#039;t sell it to anybody else, it was pretty much, &quot;Take it.&quot; The
real issue was how quickly could we get in there and relieve him of this place.
The first breakthrough stage was getting a congressional appropriation to fund
the purchase. Congressman Horton had led that fight, but still I feared I would
be fired for going against Secretary Watt&#039;s ban on acquisition, and of course I
was working closely with the Congressman behind the curtain. So, that was the
Wesleyan Chapel.

What became the park next to it was the only movie theater in town. It was a
bright blue cinderblock box. It was right on the main street, and it was the
only theater in town. That was controversial. We did buy it and tear it down.
The next building was a very large, three-story building that was functioning as
City Hall, very badly. The police were on the second floor. There was no
elevator, no functional elevator. They complained a lot about hauling the drunks
up a very long flight of stairs. They had a long running public argument for
about eight months whether they should donate it to the Park Service--publicly
owned property could only be donated to the Park Service--or they should better
sell it to a developer. It was a very public debate in this very small village.
They finally decided that they had a better bet to give it to the Park Service.
So that became the visitor center, part of what is now the centerpiece of the Park.

That was all done under the Reagan administration when--their policy intentions
were so clear that you really didn&#039;t say &quot;acquisition&quot; out loud. They were
brilliant people, I have to say. In other words, that&#039;s how they would limit the
Park Service. There would be no expansion whatsoever, because we could not buy property.

Everything that we did in the first half of my tenure in Seneca Falls was a
donation. But still, for all of the public discussions and arguments that went
on, there was a general community sense that the Park was a good thing. They
were a little reluctant about the title of it, the topic of it, but on the
whole, they thought it was a good thing.

CANDIDA SMITH: Did you have allies in the Republican Party at all?

HART: Senator Moynihan was certainly not of that party. Yes, yes, an extremely
helpful Frank Horton, who was the local Congressman. Whoever it was that
wouldn&#039;t sign the legislation was defeated, and Frank Horton took over the
district. He had never had a national park before. He was also a Cornell grad,
so that was how we got to know each other in the beginning. He decided the Park
was a really good thing. He was conservative about funding, about spending
money. He took kindly to the title, the topic, the substance of the Park. He
became very fond of it and was a very helpful mediating influence. He wasn&#039;t
going to call Secretary James Watt and say, &quot;Back off.&quot; But he was supportive,
and that helped.

James Watt appointed the running buddy of one of his principal advisors to be
the Chairman of the federal commission for the Park, the Advisory Commission.
She had tried her darndest to stop the development of the Cuyahoga Valley
National Park. She lived in Ohio, and she would attend every public meeting
there and disrupt it, scream and yell and that kind of thing to keep the meeting
from happening. She was not in the end very effective. She wasn&#039;t able to stop
Cuyahoga from developing, but she did get appointed head of our Commission.
Phyllis Schlafly&#039;s best friend was also appointed to our commission. The
chairwoman&#039;s often stated goal was to keep the Park from developing.

CANDIDA SMITH: Your park.

HART: My park. There was not going to be any development. A visitor center was
okay. Her idea was to have a post with a book on the top, one for each state.
Any woman who came to visit the Park could write her thoughts on being a woman.
We would do that maybe in the Wesleyan Chapel. All this stuff about these
historic buildings and the history of women&#039;s rights, was not the topic that we
were going to develop and talk about. Phyllis Schlafly&#039;s friend had one mission,
which was to change the name of the Park, to anything but the Women&#039;s Rights
National Historical Park. The two of them really tried.

What they really did--I discovered the power of backlash--so alienated everybody
in the community. They were so dismissive of everybody there, in Seneca Falls.
And this Chairman just so offended everybody in this small upstate village that
the backlash to her actually created a whole different level of support for the
Park because every time she&#039;d come to town, she&#039;d stay three or four days. She&#039;d
sit in the bar at the hotel and talk very loudly about how terrible this Park
was, and she wanted to stop it.

Instead, more folks in the village decided that what I was doing and what our
staff was doing and what some of the leaders of the business community had put
together was so attractive--for heaven&#039;s sake we brought Alan Alda to town. Who
would they pick, Alan Alda or this woman? It actually created a much deeper and
broader level of community support for the Park and moved it ahead faster than
we would have otherwise.

CANDIDA SMITH: It sounds like you got caught up in the battle over the Equal
Rights Amendment [ERA], at this Park. It was kind of symbolic in some way.

HART: I made a few people angry and disappointed, because I refused to discuss
current issues. I said, &quot;That&#039;s not what this Park is about.&quot; That was one of
the big fights when the legislation was going through, with universal insistence
that the Park would be limited by the legislation to the history of women&#039;s
rights. It was relatively clear in the legislation what that story was. So, I
insisted that we not have exhibits that went beyond, say, 1920 in the Park and
that we not talk about those things, that we not have programs, that we not be a
focus of attention. I said, &quot;This Park will die quicker than you can bat an
eyelash if we get into that.&quot; So, we stayed out of that. But, of course, that
was what a lot of the push pull was about.

When the Stanton house was finished in &#039;84, when we were planning the ribbon
cutting, I&#039;ll never know how it got on his agenda, but President Reagan seemed
to be coming to cut the ribbon. It was never, &quot;He will be there.&quot; But, we had at
least three waves of Secret Service that came out and inspected everything and
were talking about logistics and timing.

That was the same summer that there was a women&#039;s encampment at the Seneca Army
Depot that was just south of town, which was alleged to be the place from which
the Nike missiles were shipped overseas. So, there were several hundred women
camping out on a farm close to the depot causing quite a ruckus over things.

I worked with the President of the nonprofit group, the Stanton Foundation. I
said, &quot;If that encampment is perceived as connected to the Park, is perceived as
coming to downtown Seneca Falls because of the Park, it will be the end of this
Park.&quot; So, Corinne Guntzel and her friends, many of whom were professors at the
local college, spent the summer saying, &quot;Do your thing but don&#039;t force a
connection to the National Park because you&#039;ll kill it.&quot; The Park was still very
fragile at that point. They stayed on their farm and demonstrated at the Depot
for the most part. But when it came to Ronald Reagan coming to town, they said
quite publicly--and they were in the papers all of the time, of course, it was
the hottest story in town that summer--they would line the streets with their
bodies and make him drive over them in tanks to get to the Stanton house.
[laughs] That was really a very tense summer.

The word got out that the President was not coming, and I spent a whole day
taking calls from the press and explaining that, &quot;No, the Park Service did not
tell him not to come.&quot; Of course we hadn&#039;t invited him to come either, so my
tongue would be awfully busy working around the answers. It turned out Reagan
didn&#039;t come, and we had a perfectly lovely ribbon cutting.

CANDIDA SMITH: Who did you get to cut the ribbon?

HART: Congressman Horton was our star for the day and Ralph Peters, who had been
the owner of the house and lived in Seattle. [laughs] I had forgotten that. I
had to persuade the nonprofit Stanton Foundation to donate the Stanton house to
the Park Service, but first I had to persuade Peters to let go of it, because he
had bought it, just driving through town. It was up for sale, and he wanted to
protect it. I had been working with Ralph Peters for at least a year by then.
And then when Ronald Reagan won the election, Peters did not want to let go of
it. I flew out to Seattle where he lived, and fortunately they were having a
Park Service Regional Directors meeting, so the Director of the Park Service and
all the Regional Directors were in Seattle. I met with Ralph in the lobby of my
hotel that first night. They had these big flat upholstered arms on the chairs,
and he was banging his fists and screaming at the top of his voice in the lobby
how much he hated Ronald Reagan. That he would never give his house to Ronald
Reagan. God knows what would happen if he let go of it and Ronald Reagan got
hold of it. [laughs] I could see my job going down the tubes.

But, the Director at the time was Russ Dickinson, referred to as &quot;the
silver-haired, silver tongued Russ Dickinson.&quot; He was elegant and gracious, warm
and friendly, and everybody loved Russ Dickinson. Ralph and I met with Russ
Dickinson the next day, and Russ did his magic. He was just so impressive as a
human being. All those classic qualities: really tall, elegant looking, white
hair all combed back. He looked like the Director of the National Park Service.
He promised Ralph that if he gave us the house, the Park Service would
immediately start restoring it. Ralph said, &quot;Okay,&quot; which meant the Stanton
house jumped up about three hundred levels on the funding list, because the
Director had made that promise. That&#039;s how we got to start the renovation the
day we cut the ribbon, the day Alan Alda was there. The Park Service crew went
over and took off the old wood stairs on the house and started the construction
by replacing the stairs. We also opened the Stanton house to the public for just
the one day. This was just five months after I moved to Seneca Falls.

So, in its very odd backlash way--not so much the Republicans in general, not
even so much Ronald Reagan, except with Ralph Peters, but the fear of--I&#039;m
blanking on the secretary.

CANDIDA SMITH: Watt?

HART: The fear about James Watt. In its own way, it made it hard for me, but it
moved the Park ahead as a reaction against those forces.

CANDIDA SMITH: Well, you&#039;ve mentioned how you made a decision that you did not
want the Park to go past 1920, which is a nice historical justification, but I
wonder how this political situation affected the interpretive program that you
developed. What did you learn about how to present an interpretation of a
subject, which even though it is more than a hundred years old, is still highly political?

HART: I found that very easy when I was working there, because most people that
I talked to did not know that women did not have the right to vote until this
century. They were astonished by it. That would catch their attention
immediately. The rest of it was really complicated in their minds. What do you
mean they couldn&#039;t go to college? What do you mean they couldn&#039;t be a lawyer?
You might be able to get into all of that, but that women couldn&#039;t vote caught
everybody&#039;s attention. That was always my focus, was talking about women getting
the right to vote. I didn&#039;t ever talk about the Equal Rights Amendment, which of
course was announced in Seneca Falls, right after women did get the right to
vote. But it was clear that, first of all, we didn&#039;t have the time or money to
even tell the primary story, the right to vote story.

My great disappointment about that Park was that I left after six years out
there, and we&#039;d sponsored a national design competition; we&#039;d had entries from
every state in the country. A very prestigious jury picked the bold design of
going back to the historic bricks and just saving a sense of the Wesleyan
Chapel. That had all gone very well. The two young women from Harvard who&#039;d won
that design competition, Ray Kinoshita and Ann Marshall, created a team of
experienced professionals and won the contract to do the A&amp;E work, architectural
and engineering study and design. We got a massive amount of funding at the
time; we had a line item congressional appropriation for seven and a half
million dollars to do that project.

I left with the proviso that the interpretive exhibit team had to hire an
historian. That was as far as I got, and then I left. The exhibits there now
barely tell the story of what happened in Seneca Falls around the convention. My
least favorite exhibit was a monitor set on a post that had an interactive video
with a current young man and a young woman talking about how they feel about
dating. I&#039;m like--we&#039;re spending federal money on this?

In the visitor center there was one huge wall that had a poster as part of a
permanent exhibit. It showed a placard from a modern protest, something about
lesbian rights. It caused a backlash. Of the sort that I envisioned from day
one, and thought, &quot;What for? Let this park get its legs under it talking about
history and then take on a lecture series. Who can complain about a lecture
series?&quot; A blue ribbon committee came in to look at it and recommended taking it
down, but then that caused a backlash.

My disappointment with that whole permanent visitor experience is that it
doesn&#039;t, in my opinion, turn a light bulb on. To me, that&#039;s number one. Help
visitors understand the history, the context, of women&#039;s rights and inspire them
to think about how history is shaping today&#039;s society and their lives. You don&#039;t
need to push current issues in their face with federal tax money.

CANDIDA SMITH: What was your thinking about dealing with the issues of divorce
couverture? Couverture might have been kind of technical, but divorce was
certainly a central issue for the Seneca Falls group and for Stanton throughout
her life.

HART: I always felt that all we had to do was tell the story of what the
historical issues were and how they fought them. Unfortunately, it was not what
happened there. It&#039;s a complicated story, but you take it one at a time and talk
about property rights and divorce and who inherits the money and under what
circumstances. There&#039;s a whole very rich story of the wealthy Dutch landowners
in eastern New York supporting women&#039;s rights, because they saw over time their
daughter would lose the family inheritance, and could be treated very badly by
her husband. There was nothing they could do about it. It was a compelling story
to tell and important for people to learn. To this day I don&#039;t believe that the
Park, using federal tax dollars, needs to push today&#039;s issues in anybody&#039;s face.
The Park should enlighten them--I&#039;ve always believed that if somebody
understands the larger context, and some of the highlights of what&#039;s happened,
then going away and thinking about their own life, looking around them with
different eyes, is more important than trying to push some button about a
current issue, which is going to be different for every Superintendent. I feel
very strongly about it, and I don&#039;t think the Park is very successful in that regard.

CANDIDA SMITH: You were Park Superintendent for six years there?

HART: Yes.

CANDIDA SMITH: What led you to move on?

HART: Most of the development of the--the Stanton house was restored; the
Wesleyan Chapel was underway; the right people had been hired to do it. I
thought the Park had a very straightforward future in front of it. We had
acquired the McClintock house, and I had money in the pipeline to get that
restored. I&#039;ve never been a person to do operations. Operations and maintenance
are not my thing. I certainly might have stayed through the development of the
Wesleyan Chapel, and it was a hard decision to leave when I did. I said that it
was just time. &quot;I&#039;m burned out. I&#039;m worn out. I need to do something different
in my life.&quot;

It had been a very emotional few years for me. Somebody said to me that when you
find a real passion in your life, it&#039;s often about healing a personal wound and
you don&#039;t know it, but you just--to me going out and spending six years there,
plus two years before that talking about issues of women&#039;s rights, when I had
had this whole career when I never thought about it, but I had been in the
middle of it. So it was a real acting out of a lot of stuff that had been
building up inside of me and again pulling at pieces of me to change. I know
it&#039;s true, and I&#039;ve been told it often enough, that one of my strengths is that
I can inspire people when I talk, because I&#039;m connecting to some deeper part of
me. Well, I went a whole lot deeper when I went out there, in terms of
connecting what I was publicly doing with who I was deep down inside, which was
exhilarating when it worked and went well. It was very inspiring, obviously to
the people around me, but it was also exhausting. I needed to be doing something
different for myself.

[Narrator addendum: But before we move on to the next phase, I think it
important also to mention some of the folks who put their heart and soul into
getting this Park off the ground. It truly takes a dedicated army for liftoff.
First and foremost are the Stanton family, including the great granddaughter
Rhoda Barney Jenkins, and great grandson John Barney and great-great
granddaughter Coline Jenkins. They frequently visited the Park and always
brought with them significant donations, including all of the Elizabeth Cady
Stanton furniture now in her restored home, her china, and many additional
historic pieces. They also purchased the lot next to the Stanton home and
donated it for our eventual use. Their presence and enthusiasm gave the
fledgling Park a stature it could not have had without them.

Bert Fortner and Phil Prigmore were architects working for the Village of Seneca
Falls and also planning the state Urban Cultural Park there with the head of the
UCP, Augie Sinicropi. Our joint planning was both a great joy and a challenge.
Corinne Guntzel and Lucille Povero were Presidents and leaders of the non-profit
Stanton Foundation that accomplished heroic work that the Park could not.
Marilyn Bero was the link to the National Women&#039;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls
and worked tirelessly to smooth out bumps between the Park and local
organizations. The Hall of Fame&#039;s independent work and programs also lent
credence and substance to the development of the Park, and the Seneca Falls
Historical Society was the source of invaluable information on the history of
the community.

Ralph Peters purchased the Stanton home with great assistance from Audie Malone,
a Seneca Falls real estate brokerage owner who also negotiated the tricky months
when Peters was refusing to sell to the Stanton Foundation because of his fear
of Secretary Watt. Audie Malone was also a great help to me with other Village
matters, as well as my personal home! The regional office staff of the Park
Service in Boston was extraordinarily helpful to the Park and to me, negotiating
our first visitor center, securing a free excess furniture set for eight in our
new office, writing and producing a walking tour, helping with the Alan Alda
ribbon cutting July 1982, coming out to march in the Convention Days parades so
we would look more substantial than we really were in the early days, and just
everything that I needed. I could not have done it without their help. And their
good and cheering spirits when things seemed maybe not to be possible to
accomplish. Herb Cables was the Regional Director whose enthusiasm for the Park
supported and affirmed the efforts of the staff to help the Park.

And underlying it all was the work of a high school student, Hanns Kuttner, who
got all the Park properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places
and the Wesleyan Chapel listed as a national landmark, at the suggestion of
Nancy Dubner. If these two had not engineered this accomplishment before the
National Park Service arrived, I think the unimpressive appearance of the
historic sites would have been an insurmountable challenge.]

CANDIDA SMITH: So, where did you go?

HART: Well, my parents were getting ill. They were growing older, and getting
less well. They had moved to Richmond, Virginia to be closer to my sister and
her family when my father retired. So it was time to get closer to them, and I
had always wanted to live in Washington DC. I went on a detail, which turned out
to be about four months, working for the Twenty First Century project, a Park
Service, look-into-the-future big project. I did that for about four months. My
parents got sicker and my mother started to have a series of strokes and was
really not at all well. So, I decided it really was time to live closer. It was
a good change for me to be in a bigger place. I used to describe Seneca Falls to
my close friends as &quot;There wasn&#039;t a corner I hadn&#039;t been around.&quot; There were no
surprises left. And I really need that to inspire me, like, &quot;Oh, what&#039;s next?
What&#039;s next?&quot;

I loved being in Washington. I loved the music. I loved the culture. It&#039;s a
gorgeous, gorgeous city. All the flowers. I was living in the city, and I loved
everything about Washington, except for the summer weather. So, I applied for a
job with legislation in Washington and got that after about four months, I
guess. While I was still on the detail, I got the job in legislation, so I
permanently moved to Washington, working on new parks again.

CANDIDA SMITH: So you were writing the legislation for new parks for how long a time?

HART: I was in that job six years and loved it. I got to work on some parks that
were really dear to my heart. Manzanar, the World War II Japanese internment
camp in southern California. I did a lot of work on Manzanar. Some in the Park
Service didn&#039;t want it to happen; some in this region, California, didn&#039;t want
it. I did a lot of damage control. So, I was very proud of the fact that it did
get to be established, and it&#039;s an amazing place now. I did a lot of work on
Petroglyphs, which was the same thing.

CANDIDA SMITH: So, you were in New Mexico?

HART: Yeah, the volcanic cliffs on the west side of Albuquerque. There was
pretty general support for the Petroglyphs, but my part in that was to say that
you can&#039;t just do the Petroglyphs; you need the volcanoes. That&#039;s where the
sacred--well they are both sacred sites, but the more sacred sites are the
volcanoes and the sacred land around them. I did a lot of damage control on
that, a lot of promoting. It really needed to be the larger park, which got into
all sorts of really complicated land ownership issues and development issues,
but it did end up being the larger park. Those are the two that stand out in my
mind at the moment. But I thoroughly loved expanding the Park Service.

Many in the Park Service have said to me that I was the one that started idea
parks in the Park Service. I&#039;m not sure that I started them. I think that&#039;s an
overstatement. I think they are parks about values, and those are the ones that
have always excited me. I always really pushed to get them in the Park Service.
They&#039;ve always been odd. Manzanar was very hard for the Park Service to swallow
because people kept saying there aren&#039;t any buildings there anymore, what is
there to preserve? I&#039;d say, &quot;Well, you can see the outlines of the buildings,
the foundations, the ghosts of them, and it&#039;s very haunting in its own way.&quot;
Women&#039;s Rights had a very hard time, because the buildings didn&#039;t look grand,
they didn&#039;t look presidential. I&#039;d have to keep saying, &quot;You have to understand
that women&#039;s history doesn&#039;t happen in palaces, and because it isn&#039;t a palace
doesn&#039;t mean that the Park Service can&#039;t be there&quot;

It&#039;s all about values for me. Values and untold stories, things that haven&#039;t
been brought to light before, that the Park Service has the ability bring into
the national consciousness.

[Narrator addendum: These parks raised the issue that is core to the Park
Service, and that is interpreting stories through historic structures. I believe
one aspect of the meaning of my starting &quot;idea parks&quot; is promoting two parks
that did not have gorgeous, impressive, structures from which to tell the story.
And for a time we weren&#039;t positive that the remains of the Wesleyan Chapel in
Seneca Falls in fact included historic remains of the Chapel. So I was promoting
new parks in spite of a lack of spectacular architecture. So I was promoting
parks whose story, whose story about values, was more significant than the
architecture available to tell the story.]

And there was a second controversy, especially regarding Manzanar. Some in the
Park Service believed that the Service was in the business of celebrating
American History. This point of view was described by some as telling &quot;only
happy stories&quot; and no one could believe that the internment of Japanese for no
fault but being Japanese could be considered a happy story. There was
significant pushback around this concern.

CANDIDA SMITH: So, how did the Rosie idea generate?

HART: I came in relatively late on that, before the legislation but relatively
late. The properties of the four shipyards Henry Kaiser built, somehow or
another evolved to the City of Richmond and the Redevelopment Authority.
Shipyard Number Two, which was the largest one, is now covered with attractive
housing on streets with names like Schooner Drive, Wind Drift, Sea Lane and Sea
Breeze. One section, the most visible section, was intentionally designed to
look like Cape Cod. The first city councilwoman for the City of Richmond, Donna
Powers said that we were losing our history, that we were destroying it. This is
where World War II happened, and now it&#039;s Sea Breeze Drive. So she first wanted
to name the park that is surrounded by all that housing the &quot;Rosie the Riveter
Park,&quot; and then she decided there should be a memorial. So the city sponsored a
design competition for the memorial, and that of course, is what&#039;s there now.

CANDIDA SMITH: What year are we talking about?

HART: I&#039;m not sure what year it started. They dedicated it in 2000. It took them
three years, so three or four years before then.

CANDIDA SMITH: So, you got involved about when?

HART: 1999. Once the memorial was well underway--before it was finished, but
underway--the city went to Congressman Miller, George Miller, and said that we&#039;d
like to have this affiliated with the Park Service. So he shepherded a law to
enactment saying the Park Service would have to do a study, to see whether or
not it could be an affiliated area. He hadn&#039;t been talking to the Park Service
much, because we would have said, &quot;It can&#039;t be because it&#039;s not historic.&quot; They
hadn&#039;t even built it yet, so it certainly was not historic. But Ray Murray, who
is in charge of planning for the Park Service regional office in San Francisco,
went over to meet with the group. He looked around and he asked what were all
these historic buildings that we now know as Shipyard Number Three and the Ford
Assembly Building. The group told him, and he said that this memorial couldn&#039;t
be an affiliated area on its own, because it&#039;s not historic, but he noted that
there were all these historic properties here and that that&#039;s what we&#039;d need to
look at to see if there is a national park here.

So he wrote a study that would include all of the properties that are now part
of the Park. I guess the original concept was that the Park Service would own
everything. Ray was very excited about it. The Regional Director, John Reynolds,
was very excited about it. The draft study was submitted to headquarters in
Washington, and I was working part of the time with the planning office there.
It just went like that. [claps] Denny Galvin, Deputy Director of the Park
Service, who had been a long-time standing strength in the agency, said there&#039;s
no way we are going to do this park. It&#039;s a nationally significant story, but
there&#039;s no way we could do this park. We can&#039;t afford it. The Regional Director
said it was the best thing that ever happened; we&#039;ve got to do it. I was told
there was some yelling over the phone about the study.

So the Washington office asked me to come in and edit the study and basically
work through this controversy that&#039;s built up. So, I did my usual thing and got
on the phone and called everybody and said, &quot;What&#039;s your position? What&#039;s your
understanding of somebody else&#039;s position? What&#039;s your idea of what a compromise
might be?&quot; I made that loop two or three times around at least, talking to
everybody, and then proposed a compromise, which was that the Park Service could
not own or preserve anything in Shipyard Number Three, couldn&#039;t own the Ford
building, couldn&#039;t preserve it, and couldn&#039;t own or preserve the SS Red Oak
Victory. At which point, they asked what makes for a park there. I said, &quot;Well,
we have the Park Service sized things that the Park Service can do. We can build
a visitor center. We could own and restore&quot;--and this was my real
compromise--&quot;we could own and restore the Kaiser hospital, the child care
center, and the war working housing. Those are all perfectly manageable
structures. They all tell nationally significant stories of their own, and that
could be the park if all else fails and Shipyard Number Three never opens to the
public and the city doesn&#039;t do anything.&quot; And everybody said that sounded good.
So, everybody started talking to everybody else again.

We had another flare-up because there had not been a survey across the nation to
make sure that Richmond was the best place to do this. The Park Service had
become polarized over this issue.

CANDIDA SMITH: I guess I&#039;m not clear on what the deal is to be polarized over.
Is it fiscal? Is it the story?

HART: There were two polarizing issues. The one I was just telling you was
money. It was pure-and-simple money. Denny Galvin, the Deputy Director, said
that if we devoted the entire National Park Service construction budget to Rosie
for ten years, we still couldn&#039;t finish it. It was just money on that first
round. The second round, that we hadn&#039;t proved that this was the best place to
do a Rosie / World War II home front park, was more about process, and not
following procedures. In the end, some people got on the phone and did a
telephone survey of the historic preservation offices around the country and
confirmed that Richmond was by far the best place to support the park story. So
that all got resolved like two weeks before the hearing, which had been
scheduled because George Miller was retiring from the head of the Natural
Resources Committee, and this was his going-away gift essentially.

We did all agree with this compromise I suggested and wrote a vastly different
piece of legislation. I was part of the team that came up with the concepts,
along with Warren Brown, head of planning in Washington, but it was actually
written by the Chief of Legislation for the Park Service, Don Hellman. And the
new draft went to the Hill just in time to not embarrass anybody for the
hearing. [chuckles] We testified in favor of it, and the rest is history. Well,
I shouldn&#039;t say that. It was signed by President Clinton in October of 2000,
again, in anticipation of an election after which it might not have been signed
by the new administration. So President Clinton didn&#039;t have a broken collar
bone. It wasn&#039;t December. But the legislation was up against it. [laughs]
Everybody believed it was up against it to get it signed before it died with the
end of that congressional session.

CANDIDA SMITH: How did you land the job as the Founding Superintendent? Did you
volunteer for it?

HART: I was very interested. I had become really enamored of it in the course of
editing the study and working on the legislation and trying to figure it all
out. I had no intention of moving again, but went to lunch with friend and
Departmental Solicitor Nicholas Targ. In the middle of our discussion on the
park legislation he said you need to go out there and start this up. My parents
and sister had all passed away while I was living in Washington. I had always
wanted to live in San Francisco. I had always wanted to live in Washington,
Vermont, and San Francisco, and Boston. And I had already lived in Washington
and Boston, and spent enough time in Vermont. So, when the legislation
passed--by this time I had been out here several times, I had gotten to know the
local people and thought, &quot;Oh this is just fabulous.&quot; So I told the Regional
Director I was interested, but they were going to compete the job, of course.
Actually that&#039;s not true. He had told me that he would just transfer me, that he
would just reassign me. I had forgotten that part of it. The regional office
decided to advertise it. And then the region decided to advertise for an Acting Superintendent.

So, I applied for the acting job with much handwringing. There&#039;s this thing in
the Park Service; sometimes acting superintendents can&#039;t get selected for the
permanent job, and sometimes it&#039;s a shoo-in to be selected as permanent, and you
never really know which will happen. But I applied for it, because I decided it
was too dangerous not to. The Regional Director called me and said--when he saw
my application for the acting--he said I was it. You&#039;re the Superintendent. This
was eight o&#039;clock in the morning at home, and I said, &quot;I&#039;m it. Am I the acting,
or am I the permanent?&quot; He said I was the permanent; that he had decided to
scrap all of that because I had decided to apply for it. So, I became the
permanent Superintendent.

CANDIDA SMITH: So, as I remember, you arrive in the Bay Area in January 2001.

HART: Well, because I was the acting, I came two or three different times that
fall for a week or two and tried to keep things going. Then I moved here January
12th, I believe it was, of 2000.

CANDIDA SMITH: 2001.

HART: 2001, you are right.

CANDIDA SMITH: Can you describe the resources that you had on hand as you
started your job?

HART: When I arrived in Richmond, every historic structure was threatened with
demolition, or death by neglect. I went to meet with the Director of the Port.
He said that we had to tear down that building on the waterfront, that the roof
was on the floor, and that there was no way the public was ever going to get in
the Port. It was too dangerous. I said okay.

I met with the county officials, and they were ballistic. They were so angry.
They had gotten federal money to demolish the two child care centers as part of
their grant to build the new Head Start center. I got this &quot;who the hell do you
think you are?&quot; in my face up three levels. I started with the facilities
manager, Al Prince, then the head of facilities, then the Assistant Deputy
County Administrator who was redder than anything on this jacket. His whole face
was just beet red as he was yelling me at about who did I think I was from the
federal government telling the county what they had to do. Thankfully, County
Supervisor John Gioia was very enthusiastic about the Park, and his enthusiasm
became shared by Al Prince and the Administrator. And they became huge
supporters of the Park.

Let&#039;s see. The Kaiser hospital, the plan was to build a second floor and then on
top of the second floor put domes and minarets so that it would look like a
mosque. The Ford Building, they had just lost--no, I guess they still had the
first developer. They still had Forest City when I got here. Forest City pulled
the plug later that spring on the Ford Building.

I remember at that point I was living in Oakland, and the regional office was
still in San Francisco, and I was taking the bus over the bridge in the morning.
The tide happened to be out, and I could see like a half a mile of mud right
there in Emeryville where the Bay Bridge ends. I remember looking out the window
and thinking, &quot;Dot-com collapsed, Forest City&#039;s pulled out, and everything has
just gone out from under Rosie.&quot; All of the things that we thought would make it
happen, which was the money of the dot-com boom, that private people would
donate money to have this happen. And here the first big project was abandoned
two months after I moved here. I wasn&#039;t wrong about that and the impact on the park.

CANDIDA SMITH: So, the funding plan for the Rosie park was to rely pretty
exclusively on private investors?

HART: Yes, for the three big pieces--the Ford building, Shipyard Number Three
and the Red Oak Victory. We sat around and talked about it in headquarters. It
was easy in Washington. We&#039;d heard about and read about the dot-com boom. It
wasn&#039;t particularly happening in Washington, so it was almost easier to imagine
it happening in California. And I had been to a preservation conference that
year, that November, in Los Angeles, the National Trust Convention, and I went
out to see the Gamble House, a dream of mine for decades, and discovered not the
Gamble House, but another prominent Greene and Greene House had been kind of
adopted by Brad Pitt. He had put millions and millions of dollars into its
restoration, quietly. I thought, &quot;Yeah, we were right, that&#039;s exactly what&#039;s
going to happen.&quot; [laughs] We really thought that a Brad Pitt would adopt
Shipyard Number Three and just make it happen--not Brad Pitt, we actually
thought it would be dot-com money. Obviously that didn&#039;t happen, and this caused
a great deal of turmoil and disappointment and sense of loss in Richmond,
because all of that money has disappeared.

I remember I used to have a meeting every week, a coordinating committee
meeting, and the head of the library said one day after about three months, he
said he finally got it, that he understood what I was saying. Because everybody
thought a trainload of federal money was coming to town, and I had to explain
over and over and over again, that there were all these dreams and expectations
and designations as national historic sites, and no money. That&#039;s what I did
year one. And, &quot;By the way, you can&#039;t tear it down, because it&#039;s been designated
as nationally significant.&quot; Which would result in the
who-the-hell-do-you-think-you-are speeches, monologues. But he was of a more
even temperament. I&#039;ll never forget him sitting at the other end of this
conference table. He said that it was like I had brought this great big box to
town, this beautiful box with this great big beautiful bow on it. They&#039;d opened
up the bow, taken the top off the box. The box was empty. I was telling them
they had to do all of this work. I said, &quot;Well, we&#039;ll do it together. But I
don&#039;t have any money to bring to you.&quot;

There was first a belief that the money would come and then a tremendous sense
of disappointment and anger that in fact the federal money wasn&#039;t going to come.
And not only was it not going to come for the restoration, but the operating
budget only supported one staff person.

CANDIDA SMITH: You.

HART: Me. That was it for the first two years.

CANDIDA SMITH: And you had no office.

HART: And I had no office. Everything I did, I begged for free. My first real
office was free space in the County Supervisors&#039; office. The space we have now
in City Hall is free. The regional office even told me that when they moved from
San Francisco to Oakland that first summer, they told me that I couldn&#039;t have a
space in Oakland, which would have put me entirely back in my car. That&#039;s what I
remember of the first year, was sitting in my car making phone calls, trying to
write notes, making meeting arrangements, and trying to figure out where to go
to the bathroom--the only public bathroom that I knew of was in City Hall. I was
never so happy as when CafÃ© Teatro opened up, right there in Marina Bay. They
had this beautiful, big, new women&#039;s bathroom, and all I had to do was buy a cup
of coffee. I could even easily park there. They even had tables and chairs,
where I could check my cell phone and write notes on their little tables.

CANDIDA SMITH: When you say that your office was your car, you&#039;re speaking literally.

HART: Literally. My first office was my temporary apartment here. I had two
bedrooms, and I had all the room in the world, but that only lasted about four
months. I operated out of my car for years, years until we actually had offices
in Richmond two years ago. So, that was two years of operating out of my car. I
had an office in San Francisco that I would use two days a week because I didn&#039;t
have any other way of getting my e-mail. Then someone took pity on me and gave
me the bid opening room in Oakland, so I actually had an office there, because,
again, I couldn&#039;t get my e-mail checked from anyplace else. Then I had the
office for a while in the County Supervisors&#039; office So, I had San Francisco, my
car, my home, Oakland, and the County Supervisor, and finally the offices we
have now at City Hall.

CANDIDA SMITH: I think we should end for today.

HART: My voice is totally gone.
