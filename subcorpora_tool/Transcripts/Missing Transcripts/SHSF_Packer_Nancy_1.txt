Introduction
This interview was carried out by the Stanford Oral History Program, sponsored by the
Stanford Historical Society and the Stanford University Archives. The Stanford Oral History
Program is under the direction of the Oral History Committee of the Stanford Historical
Society. The interview was conducted in 2012 by Peter Steinhart, writer and former lecturer
in the Department of English. The transcript and recording are part of a collection of oral
history interviews documenting the history of the University and the experiences,
accomplishments, problems, and viewpoints of members of the Stanford community.
The transcript was lightly edited by program staff and by Nancy Huddleston Packer to
correct grammar and occasional inaccuracies and to aid in overall readability, while
maintaining the interviewee’s voice as well as the transcript’s content. As a result of this
process, the transcript may not match the recording verbatim. The interview itself is an
authentic account of the remembered past, but as memory and meaning vary from person to
person, we cannot guarantee there will not be errors or discrepancies.
All uses of the interview transcript are covered by a legal agreement between Nancy

STANFORD HISTORICAL SOCIETY ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM
Purpose Statement

The Stanford Historical Society's Oral History Program explores the institutional history of
the University, with an emphasis on the transformative post-WWII period, through
interviews with leading faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and others. The project furthers the
Society's mission "to foster and support the documentation, study, publication, and
preservation of the history of the Leland Stanford Junior University."
The interview recordings and transcripts provide valuable additions to the existing collection
of written and photographic materials in the Stanford University Archives. In addition to
scholarly use, information from these interviews may be shared more broadly through print
articles, campus lectures, or electronic media.
Like any primary source material, oral history is not intended to present the final, verified, or
complete narrative of events. It is a unique, reflective, spoken account, offered by the
interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it may be deeply personal. By capturing
the flavor of incidents, events, and personalities, the oral history approach provides details
and viewpoints that are not often found in traditional records.

Abstract
Nancy Huddleston Packer discusses how Stanford’s rise to eminence came about
largely through the efforts of President J.E. Wallace Sterling and Provost Frederick Emmons
Terman. According to Packer, Sterling was adept at fundraising and at making the University
more visible in the world, whereas Terman was adept at hiring and keeping excellent faculty.
Packer discusses the styles and accomplishments of both men, and how Terman’s hiring
strategies affected some departments. Also included in the interview are Packer’s
recollections of Herbert Packer’s career at the Stanford Law School and as vice-Provost of
the University, of the student unrest during 1966-72, of the establishment of Stanford’s
Creative Writing Program, of early challenges to women faculty members, and of how
Stanford University has changed since the 1950s.

INTERVIEWEE:

NANCY HUDDLESTON PACKER

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MARCH 19, 2012

Steinhart: We are talking with Nancy Packer for the Stanford Historical Society Oral
History Program. We are talking with Nancy on March 19, 2012 at Nancy’s
apartment in Palo Alto. Nancy, we’re interested in general in how Stanford
University got to be from a good university to a great university and who and
what particularly drove those changes. Maybe the best way to start is to just
do a little brief background, because you and Herb arrived—
Packer: [00:00:42] Well, Herb arrived in 1956 and I arrived in 1958. He was in the
law school faculty and I became a Stegner Fellow and then stayed on as a
teacher.
Steinhart: Maybe you could give us a capsule description of what the university was like
when you arrived?
Packer: [00:01:20] It was—the university was beautiful. It was probably just a third
of the size of what it is now. It was well kept. Not as well kept as it is now.
The grounds were not as gardened. The university was kind of a rich
Californian’s university to go to. Pretty much as I would guess USC is today.
You could get in. You didn’t have to have particularly high grades or SATs.

9

I’m not even sure it required the SATs. Now, the major change—well, let
me say this, though.
[00:02:11] The faculty was a college faculty. There were graduate schools.
There was the law school, there was an engineering school, but each was a
“college faculty” because there was very little research, very little publication
done at that time by the faculty at Stanford. Wallace Sterling made all the
difference. He came here from—he had been a Stanford PhD, as I recall,
and he came here from being head of the Huntington Library in Southern
California. Every member of the Board of Trustees almost lived within
shouting distance. They were all from California.
Ernest Hilgard, a psychology professor here in the early days told me, “We
were generally knowledgeable, well-read, gentlemanly, urbane, and we loved
students. We were a pretty good college faculty, but not universally solid as
scholars.” Another person who joined the faculty said, “There was a
complacency, a smugness, a fear of change. It was mostly a school for the
California elite.”
[00:02:58] It was a California university for the children of wealthy
Californians. At least that’s what we thought at that time when I first came
here. Now, Sterling had ambition. He intended to do something with this
university. He once said to me, “I knew it would take circuses to get us on
the map,” and he did develop some circuses, such as the overseas campuses.
That was Sterling’s idea and it made a lot difference here.
Steinhart: Can you explain how he thought that would work?

10

Packer: [00:03:35] People would notice it. People would come here if they could go
overseas for a short while. Go six months overseas. Faculty—hey, that must
look like a paid sabbatical with benefits if you could go over. It was, in fact,
a major benefit for the humanities and the social sciences. You couldn’t send
engineers to teach students overseas, but that was a benefit that the
humanities and social sciences got from Sterling. That was one thing.
[00:04:11] He got the Ford Foundation to come out here and develop the
Center for Behavioral Sciences, which we, at that time, sort of mocking
Thorstein Veblen called the “Leisure of the Theory Classes.” We brought a
lot of people here and they liked it and they stayed, or they came back and
joined the faculty. They raised a lot of money and that meant Sterling could
get more faculty. Now we have to turn to Terman. I don’t know what
you—
Steinhart: No. Let’s stay with Sterling just for a minute—
Packer: [00:04:49] OK.
Steinhart: —if we can because you mentioned he raised a lot of money. The thing that
I recall is a PACE Program, but there is more to it than that as I am guessing.
Packer: [00:04:59] He was a fundraiser. He raised a ton of money. Can you let me
look the figures up? [Laughter]
Steinhart: OK. While it is quiet here, Nancy is looking this up in a manuscript she
prepared in 1977 on exactly this topic.
Packer: [00:05:28] [Laughter] Are you actually telling them that?
Steinhart: Yes.

11

Packer: [00:05:31] Yes, I’m looking at the manuscript to remind myself of some of
these things. Something else Sterling did, he built alumni organizations, not
just in San Francisco, but all over the country. He located our graduates, the
Stanford graduates, and organized alumni groups.
Steinhart: Was there an alumni association before?
Packer: [00:05:55] Yes. I think there was, but it wasn’t national. Nobody was really
out trying to contact the others. It was such a California institution at that
time and Sterling really turned that around.
[00:06:14] One of the other things that he did was he recognized that things
were happening in the southern part of the Bay Area and Stanford had all
this land and they couldn’t sell it. We couldn’t—didn’t do anything with it.
Steinhart: By the terms of the will.
Packer: [00:06:33] They turned it into the shopping center. One shopping center and
then the business park over there. That was a major change. Brought in
money, brought in people, as well. That was the thing that happened.
Steinhart: How important was leasing land to the funding of the university? Do you
have any idea?
Packer: [00:06:50] It was not major as I recall, Pete. I don’t know what it was. I
think it never got more than five percent of the income, but I’m not sure
about that. That is just a figure that sticks in my head, that it was about five
percent. Now, Sterling really cared about the faculty. He hired Terman.
Terman was born on the Stanford campus, his father being the great
psychologist Louis Terman. He had gone—do you want me to now talk
about Terman?

12

Steinhart: Go ahead, go ahead.
Packer: [00:07:32] Terman had gone to Washington, I guess it was, during the war.
He had met an awful lot of scientists that weren’t from Stanford—Harvard,
Yale, all over the place—and he recognized that Stanford could be a better
place than it was, a more important place than it was. So, he came back as
dean of the engineering school here and, subsequently, Sterling promoted
him to Provost. An awful lot of the credit of Stanford’s growth should go to
Terman. Not as much as should go to Sterling, but a lot should go to
Terman. He had this idea of building tall steeples on main streams. What
that meant was you get a cluster of really good faculty in a single department
and you put them together and they become visible. They become a tall
steeple. You don’t do it on something that doesn’t matter; you did it in
important areas. The way he achieved these tall steeples was, in chemistry,
for example. Not a very strong department. So, Terman never would fill a
billet.
[00:09:02] He kept getting billets, one after another, until he got a mass of
billets. Then he hired this guy named Bill Johnson to come to Stanford and
he said to him, “Look. It’s not just you. You can hire three more people
that you want to hire.” I don’t know whether it was three, two or five, but,
“You can hire these people because I’ve got these billets for you.” Johnson
hired his best scientists in the field and brought them to Stanford.
[00:09:31] Stanford’s Chemistry Department went from “not very much” to
number three in the country in short order because of Bill Johnson and the
crew that he brought here. Terman did that with a number of departments,

13

particularly at the medical school. I want to go back to Sterling for just a
minute. I want to describe Sterling a bit, since people may not know that he
was an enormous guy, very jovial, and he played the piano. He was the son
of a minister, but he was the life of the party, and the Board of Trustees at
Stanford loved Wallace Sterling because he was the life of the party and he
was kind of one of them, though he wasn’t. He was Canadian-born, but they
loved him. When he went around asking for money, they gave money.
[00:10:35] He could squeeze money from the people in San Francisco. The
West Coast, so I’m told, had not been a very good place for raising money,
but Sterling changed that and got a lot of money for Stanford. That’s one of
the things that made the difference here at Stanford.
Steinhart: What was he like to deal with personally? Did you have much to do with
him?
Packer: [00:11:05] I wouldn’t say I had much, but he was a very pleasant guy. He was
very jovial. I happened to be at Dinkelspiel Auditorium one day, and this
had nothing to do with me, but just to show you that he was jovial, but he
was tough. He was there watching some kind of performance and there was
a kid on the front row with his feet up on whatever bannister there was and
Sterling just rapped him on the shoulder and told him to put his feet down.
[Laughter] Boy, did that kid do that. He did it right away. He had strength,
but he also was the life of the party.
Steinhart: I remember him coming down to my dorm in my freshman year and playing
the piano—
Packer: [00:11:50] Yes. Yes.

14

Steinhart: As if this were some sort of club we all belonged to and I think of him as like
that. I mistrusted him, but I think of him as like that.
Packer: [00:12:01] Yes, but you mistrusted everybody, Pete.
Steinhart: Absolutely!
Packer: [00:12:06] OK. Here’s a quotation from Terman. “The quality of the
university as perceived by the world is determined principally by steeples of
excellence, in which each steeple is formed by a group of capable faculty
members having closely related interests.” That’s the steeples of excellence,
but he wanted them on main stream. Not some little island off to the side,
but a main stream of importance.
Steinhart: Do you know really where this comes from in terms of his background?
During the War he directed a staff of hundreds that came up with ways of
jamming enemy radar. He was obviously working in one of those gangs of
good minds set to a task.
Packer: [00:12:57] He was at the Radio Research Laboratory at Harvard. He was
head of a government research project at Harvard, having been here, having
taught here. I say he learned three things: that Stanford had been left out of
government sponsored research, that the government was going to continue
to finance university-based research and that he had a knack for and an
enjoyment of managing details to get results.
[00:13:23] He knew those things. When he came back to Stanford in 1946,
he wanted to apply those. First he was dean of engineering and then he
became provost. I once went to see Terman to find out—just to ask him
what he was up to, what he did. I went to his house right after he’d retired.

15

He brought out this notebook. It was about 20 inches by 30 inches. He
brought it out and put it on the table. He was the least social person, had the
fewest social graces of anybody in the world, but he knew his stuff. He put
this book on the table and he’d say “Well, now look.”
[00:14:13] He turned a page and say “OK. Professor So-and-So published
two papers in 1952 and another two in 1950—.” He knew what every
member of the faculty had done. “He had 42 students, but then he dropped
down to 36.” This book would be quite a treasure. I’m sure somebody has it
somewhere.
Steinhart: Probably in the University Archives somewhere.
Packer: [00:14:38] Must be in the Archives. He knew what every faculty member had
produced in terms of number of students and number of publications.
Steinhart: This went across the board. This wasn’t just in terms of engineering?
Packer: [00:14:50] No, no. No, no. This was everybody. He was a provost, so he
was in charge of everybody.
Steinhart: Do you have any idea how he went about finding people—finding stunning
faculties, star-quality faculties?
Packer: [00:15:04] I don’t know. Of course, one source of star-quality faculty for
outside of engineering and medicine was the Behavioral Sciences Center.
People like Gordon Craig, David Potter. Wonderful faculty came out and
they just liked the weather. [Laughter].
Steinhart: Is that how David Potter originally got here? He spent a term at the Center?
Packer: [00:15:27] Yes. And Konrad Lorenz. [00:15:29] I’m pretty sure of that. I
know that Gordon Craig did. Terman had everything down to a

16

mathematical—everything could be stated mathematically for him. What the
students thought of everybody. Everything was mathematical.
There were a lot of reasons why Stanford developed. Transcontinental air
flight. [00:16:04] We were closer to a major airport—Stanford was—than
any university in the country. There was a guy who was at the law school
who came out here. He could have gone to any place. He came out here to
Stanford because he said he could get to the airport faster than in any other
major university, so he wasted less time. [Laughter] The West Coast was
developing. You know we were—the United States was beginning to look
west.
Steinhart: In this period, California became the most populous state in the Union. By
about 1962 is when it happened.
Packer: [00:16:41] Yes, that’s right. It was amazing. Then Silicon Valley. That
was—David Packard and Bill Hewlett were Stanford students of Terman in
the late 30s and they established Hewlett Packard with a loan from Stanford
University that Terman got for them. That’s how it started—and they never
forgot it. They never forgot what Stanford had done for them.
Steinhart: It was one of Terman’s plans, I seem to have read somewhere, to get his
graduates to locate here and to cluster so he could keep his knowledge base.
Packer: [00:17:24] That’s right. That’s right. There were a lot of the predecessors of
the dot com industry. That started here and it started at Stanford. Basically,
there was Terman, Hewlett, and Packard that were the magnet for
developing that industry out here. Ask me some questions.
Steinhart: Can you say something about what Terman was like?

17

Packer: [00:17:57] Yes. Terman was, I think, humorless. He was obsessive, I think.
I didn’t know him all that well, but he seemed unsociable. He was not a
person who cared about making himself attractive to people. He didn’t care
about that. That was not something that mattered to him. He was pretty
much all business.
Steinhart: How about some of the other academic stars that came to Stanford under
this pursuit of spires? I think you mentioned Gordon Craig, David Potter.
How about the medical school?
Packer: [00:18:38] The medical school—that was one of Terman’s great
achievements. He left billets open in biochemistry and biochemists on the
faculty wanted to fill them and he wouldn’t do it. He had enough billets that
he got Arthur Kornberg to come, and he gave him three or four
appointments. Here’s a story. We had—Stanford had tried to woo Joshua
Lederberg, who was at Wisconsin. Lederberg wasn’t interested.
[00:19:15] Then Terman got these billets and got Arthur Kornberg to come
and Lederberg called and said “I’d like to come, too,” [Laughter] because it
was a great biochemistry department. How many Nobel Prize winners were
there in that? There were several. There was Berg, Kornberg, Lederberg, all
the “bergs”.
Steinhart: Does this period of expansion lay the seeds also for the Linear Accelerator
Center?
Packer: [00:20:04] I’m pretty sure it must have. I don’t know—I actually don’t know
when the guy who was head of the linear accelerator came here. There were
two fellows who ran the linear accelerator and I can’t remember their names

18

offhand. They don’t come to me. Oh, it was Pief Panofsky and Sid Drell.
1962 is when he came. There was kind of a rebellion here. I’ll just mention
this. There was kind of a rebellion because the physicists didn’t like it a bit—
Steinhart: Oh yes?
Packer: [00:20:42] —that there was going to be a linear accelerator. It was separate
from them. It was going to be separate from them and they didn’t like it a
bit. I don’t know what Sterling did. He gave them something to placate
them.
Steinhart: What about the history department?
Packer: [00:20:56] History was a rather poor area at Stanford. They were good
college teachers, but they were not tall steeples on main streams at all. We
had lost several good people. Arthur Wright was a professor of history. He
was perhaps one of the two most distinguished at this point, which is 1960.
He had a wife who was a PhD in history, but because of a nepotism rule she
could not teach at Stanford. Arthur and Mary went to Yale where she was
the first woman ever to be allowed to teach in Yale College.
Steinhart: Wow.
Packer: [00:21:59] There were things like that that had to be changed before Stanford
could really develop.
Steinhart: Did the nepotism rule affect you?
Packer: [00:22:07] This was just at the end of—it was there, but I started as a lecturer.
Wally Stegner just said, "You’re going to do it." He just didn’t pay any
attention to it. Then when I became assistant professor, it was gone by then.
It was a tough one for a while.

19

Steinhart: Was the policy written or was it just observed?
Packer: [00:22:32] I think it was just observed. The University was so afraid of
having any woman who was married to somebody. The history department,
how did it develop? Arthur left, Mary left, so that left it pretty dim. Stuart
Hughes left, so history was kind of dim, and they began building it. A guy
named Thomas Bailey became the history—you remember Bailey?
Steinhart: Yes.
Packer: [00:23:02] I don’t know what kind of a scholar he was, but he was a terrific
writer. He wrote wonderful books.
Steinhart: I still use his textbook.
Packer: [00:23:08] Of course you do. He was a wonderful writer. He became the
head of the history department and he brought Gordon Wright, who was
very distinguished, and Richard Lyman and then pretty soon, Gordon Craig
came, and David Potter. History developed very rapidly and became very
important here. English developed, too. Of course, English always had
Stegner from 1946 on. English had Stegner. The writing program had
developed apart from the university in a way, because of Stegner and his
writing program.
Steinhart: Was it in some way autonomous, apart from the English department, or was
it nestled within the English department?
Packer: [00:23:54] It was nestled. It was in the English department. I think Wally
didn’t want it to be. At first. Wally just came here and taught English and
taught Creative Writing. Edward Jones was a big oil man and he came out
here to visit his brother, R.F. Jones, the head of the department, and met

20

Wally, and obviously fell in love with Wally, and he decided he would finance
the Creative Writing Program.
[00:24:33] He gave something, two or three hundred thousand dollars, which
was tons of money in those days. He promised more. That’s when the
creative writing program was established. I think that was either 1952 or ’54.
Then he died before he could finish giving the money and after that Wally
went out and got the money himself. That was a major thing happening at
Stanford, was the creative writing program. It had national visibility. Don
Kennedy once said to me “it was the jewel in the crown.” [Laughter]
[00:25:10] I think that was pretty nearly true.
There was a geography department at Stanford, and Terman got rid of it. He
said—wouldn’t have said it this way: “There’s no ‘there’ there.” There was
no real research and nothing came from it. He got rid of the geography
department and took those billets and gave them to geology which became a
very important function around here, an important program. OK, you want
to talk about the schools?
Steinhart: Sure, we can.
Packer: [00:26:03] OK. In 1946, just about the time that Terman came back from
the wars, Carl Spaeth became the dean of the law school. He was quite a
builder of the law school. Ultimately, of course, it took about twelve years or
so, but ultimately the law school came from being a nice teaching place to a
major law school and rated first, second or third in the country in the middle
‘60s. One way that happened, a bunch of law professors brought here by

21

Spaeth got together and decided that when Spaeth resigned, when he was
finished, they decided they were going to make a better law school.
[00:26:58] They were the cream of the law school at that time, but there were
a lot of teachers and they were the only scholars, these three or four men.
They went to Columbia and raided it. They raided Columbia and got very
distinguished faculty, four very distinguished faculty members to leave
Columbia and come to Stanford.
Steinhart: Who were these people?
Packer: [00:27:22] This was Gerry Gunther, Charlie Meyers, Howard Williams, and
Marc Franklin. They came here and then somebody else wants to come
from Cornell, Joe Sneed, who became the Chief Judge of the Federal Court
and Ninth Circuit. It just changed things immediately for the law school.
Bayless Manning became the dean and then Charlie Meyers and then Tom
Ehrlich. I mean, the law school just really developed immensely during the
‘60 and 70s.
Steinhart: You suggest a principle that excellence attracts excellence.
Packer: [00:28:14] Well, it sort of was that. Also, money attracts excellence.
[Laughter] That too!
Steinhart: That too!
Packer: [00:28:23] Weather attracts excellence. You can’t forget Stanford’s situation
here. [00:28:49] Sterling really wanted it to develop, very much. They were
finding a successor to Carl and there was a guy who came here. His name
doesn’t matter. Herb didn’t like him for Dean, others didn’t like him for
Dean, but it was a situation where Wally wanted to make a decision. Wally

22

called the law school up to his house to tell the law faculty that he had
decided on this guy to be the new dean. Herb got up and walked out, which
was kind of unusual. Wally obviously liked Herb well enough to later ask
him to join the administration.
Steinhart: Yes. Eventually, Herb Packer became vice-provost.
Packer: [00:29:34] Shortly. Not long thereafter it came time for the provost to be
appointed after Terman resigned. Wally called Dick Lyman and Herb to his
house and said, “I want one of you to be provost and one to be vice provost
and you have to decide which it is.” I haven’t told this much until I read
Dick’s book and it’s a footnote in Dick’s book [00:30:06] Herb and Dick
went on, “Well, how should we do this?” Herb said, “I don’t want to be
provost. I want to do the Study of Education at Stanford,”1 and so they very
easily divided it between them. I don’t know why that story struck me—
came to me.
Steinhart: It sounds like there’s a certain informality to how the decisions were made
then that probably doesn’t persist today.
Packer: [00:30:30] At that time Wally would make the decisions who was going to be
dean. I don’t think a president would make it now.
Steinhart: How about the med school? Do you have some sense of what happened
there? They moved it down from San Francisco, which was a big deal.
Packer: [00:31:05] It was a major thing, moving it down from San Francisco made all
the difference. Henry Kaplan was a professor here in radiology. He was
1

Herbert Packer organized and directed the Study of Education at Stanford, an imaginative,
searching inquiry whose ten published volumes of discussion and recommendations
significantly affected every aspect of the University
23

certainly one of the most distinguished faculty members in the medical
school ever. He had an appointment and offer from Harvard or Yale or
some place. He went in to talk to Sterling about it and Sterling said, “We’re
going to build this place up. We’re going to move the medical school down
here because the doctors, the really good doctors need to have contact with
the scientists. We’re going to move it down here. So don’t leave.” Kaplan
didn’t leave and then the Kornberg appointment came and the medical
school moved down here and the big hospital was built. The medical school
really developed very rapidly as a result of moving it down here. It was
closer to a major university than almost any medical school in the country.
[00:32:20] You go to New York; they’re not even anywhere near the
university, they’re off on their own. Cornell.
Steinhart: Harvard…
Packer: [00:32:31] Moving the medical school down here from San Francisco was a
major decision and it was Sterling’s and he led the drive. He led the effort to
get it down here and got the barons under control. There were these little
barons that ran the medical school. Little baronetcies I guess you could say.
He got it under control. He appointed pretty good deans. There had been a
lot of deans in and out. Medical schools are like that.
Steinhart: What do you mean? They’re contentious?
Packer: [00:33:10] Yes. They are really contentious.
Steinhart:

Are law schools contentious, as well, by nature?

Packer: [00:33:14] No. Well, there is some contention. English departments are
contentious, too!

24

Steinhart: [Laughs] All departments are. It seems to me—is it unusual that as the law
school built up it seemed to have a real prominence in university affairs here
that might not have been characteristic of other universities?
Packer: [00:33:38] I don’t know what you mean, actually.
Steinhart: I’m talking about Herb being vice-provost.
Packer: [00:34:03] Yes. I don’t know of any others at that time.
Steinhart: I was thinking that there were other people in the room making these kinds
of decisions with him.
Packer: [00:34:14] Oh, well there were plenty of people making decisions about the
law school. I am trying to remember any who went over into the central
administration. I can’t think of any except Herb.
Steinhart: I’m just thinking it was obviously a kind of center of intellect.
Packer: [00:34:36] Well, once they got those guys from Columbia. Before that, it was
a sleepy little town, the law school was. It was Herb, and there was Phil
Neal, who became the dean of the University of Chicago and a few others.
There were three of four younger members of the law school faculty who
thought it was a sleepy place. They are the ones who made it into a first-class
institution. That’s really true, Pete. It was mostly old fogies. I’m trying to
think. Byron Sher was here.
[00:35:21] He was not particularly active then, but he was good. He was not
particularly active in the politics of the university, except at one point.
Occasionally and yes, he was active at one point. He was the head of a
committee to decide whether or not they were going to—the manager of the
bookstore threw out some black kids who were stealing candy or something.

25

[00:35:47] The black community went up in arms, and Byron had to make
the decision; he was the chairman of the committee that had to study
whether or not it had been racist. They decided it hadn’t. Want to talk about
the troubles?
Steinhart: Yes! Talk about the troubles.
Packer: [00:37:19] You had gone, hadn’t you? Were you here during the troubles?
Steinhart: No, I was safely ensconced elsewhere mostly. The worst of it I was overseas.
Packer: [00:37:29] Oh. Lucky you!
Steinhart: I was in the Peace Corps for a lot of it.
Packer: [00:37:33] I remember. I knew you were in the Peace Corps, yes.
Steinhart:

I was at UCLA, I guess, when David Harris got his head shaved and that
was sort of the inaugural year, it seemed to me. 1966 is about the beginning
of it.

Packer: [00:37:50] The football players went after him.
Steinhart: Yes.
Packer: [00:37:52] Actually, Stanford started early with the troubles and finished late.
It started in 1966 when some people sat in at the president’s office. I can’t
remember what it was about, but if you want me to look it up I’ll try. That
was bad enough. Then the football players decided they were going to evict
them. Actually, Herb and I were at a dinner party and Herb was called to the
phone and he said, “I’m sorry, I have to go.” He was something in the
faculty, I don’t remember.
[00:38:33] He was not in the administration, he was in the faculty, and he has
some role where he had some responsibilities. They called him to come see

26

what he could do and he and another faculty member, whose name I don’t
remember, stood in the doorway of the president’s office to keep those guys
from coming in. Of course, they were football players. They were not going
to run over two old men. They didn’t come in. That was 1966. In 1972,
Encina burned.
[00:39:11] They never found out who did that, whether it was arson or
spontaneous combustion, but it burned. In those six years, Stanford had
more troubles than any other institution in the country. By then, Cal was no
longer having problems. Harvard had already done its big show. Columbia
had done its big show. The kid had been shot at Kent State. I mean, all of
these things took place in about 1970. Stanford continued to have the
problems until 1972. It really suffered as much as any university did.
Steinhart: Any idea why?
Packer: [00:39:54] I don’t know. No, I don’t know. I always say weather had
something to do with it.
Steinhart: [Laughs] I remember 1970 when I moved back here, I had a house on
Addison Avenue, about five blocks from University Avenue, and Judy and I
used to sit on the stoop on a Saturday night and sniff the tear gas floating
down from University Avenue.
Packer: [00:40:12] When was this?
Steinhart: 1970.
Packer: [00:40:15] Well, ’70 was the tough time. In ’70, the faculty was about to
resign en masse because of “the troubles”—and then Kent State just finished

27

everything off. I have a list of the things that happened at Stanford during
the troubles. Do you want to know it?
Steinhart: Sure.
Packer: [00:40:43] OK. Many of the things at Stanford were less dramatic, but
equally significant. Sit-ins, threats and intimidations, disruption of classes
and meetings, burglarizing of files, vandalism, nights of trashing, injuries
from billy clubs, thrown rocks, beatings and the gun shooting of two—just in
the leg—but two students received gunshots. Fire was a major problem. A
faculty member’s house was firebombed. At that point the university
security sent to high profile people -- I don’t know how many people, five or
six -- sent around to those people, and insisted on putting in fire alarms all
over the house. My house was one of them because of Herb—fire alarm
systems all over my house, and a direct line to the police department on the
telephone so that we could call the police instantly.
[00:42:30] As a matter of fact, I was horsing around with my son and his foot
apparently hit the telephone and a minute later my daughter came rushing in
and said, “Mom, there’s a policeman at the door and he has his gun out!”
[Laughter] I rushed to the door and I said, “What’s going on?” He said,
“The phone rang.” I said, “Well, there’s nothing wrong here, it’s OK.” He
said, “If you hadn’t been there, I was going to shoot the handle off the
door.” The next day I had that telephone taken out of there.
Steinhart: Why were you singled out for this?
Packer: [00:43:01] Herb was vice-provost. In fact, when the students demanded a
meeting it was on top of what was then the bowling alley in the dark. Herb

28

represented the university because he was vice-provost. He couldn’t give
anything away. Wally and Dick were afraid if either one of them went, they’d
give something away that they wouldn’t be able to get back. So they sent
Herb. It was very spooky for us. It was really spooky. Having a direct
phone line to the police department, that was not useless.
So, anyway, fire bombing. I’ve got this all down here. First thing was the
frame ROTC building, leveled by fire. Second attempt in three months.
Sterling’s office was fire bombed. All of his memorabilia destroyed.
Arsonists destroyed the lifetime’s research of a scholar at the Behavioral
Science Center. You’d think the school was going up in flames during this
period. The headquarters of the Student Conservatives was firebombed. An
attempt was made to firebomb a house on campus of an administrator. The
lounge of a dormitory was destroyed by fire. Later that autumn a firebomb
damaged the Stanford Linear Accelerator.
Steinhart: This is all ’68-’69?
Packer: [00:45:15] This is ’68 through ’72, yes. This was just the fire bombing. The
rest I have summarized, but this is just the firebombing. They went up to
destroy the home of a professor who had served on the Advisory Board.
Firebombed. Three automobiles firebombed. [Laughs] It was a war zone!
A fire was started in the law school. A fire at the campus bike shop. The
Chicano Clubhouse severely damaged by fire. June of 1972, Encina Hall.
[00:44:01] It never happened to us, because that was when Herb got sick,
very shortly thereafter, so nobody cared about us. But the phone was still
there. We had to get rid of it.

29

Sterling left after all his memorabilia were destroyed and the Board of
Trustees appointed a member—Kenneth Pitzer, who was the president at
Rice and had done a good job, apparently, at Rice, and he was a member of
the Bohemian Club. He knew all these birds, all these members of the
Board, and this was before the Board was enlarged. They appointed him to
succeed Sterling. He came and he was totally out of his depth. He could not
deal with it. He lasted about 18 months, maybe not quite that long. He left.
Dick was—
Steinhart: Dick Lyman.
Packer: [00:47:26] Thank you. Dick Lyman was the provost at that time. He was not
totally loved by the board for a number of reasons. One, it had been
traditional that the officers of Stanford University were members of the
Bohemian Club. But, it did not accept Jews as members. Dick refused to
join the Bohemian Club when he was provost.
[00:48:05] You can imagine that the Board of Trustees, all of whom were
members—not all, but most of them were members, didn’t much like Dick.
Here is this New England guy who looked like a minister of the Unitarian
Church, and they didn’t much like him, but he could do that job and they
knew he could do the job. He became the president. That made a lot of
difference. About this time, the Study of Education at Stanford, which-Steinhart: The one that Herb started? The one that Herb was working on?
Packer: [00:48:42] Yes, the Study of Education at Stanford was published and many
changes were made at Stanford. One was to the Board of Trustees. There
were eight new alumni positions selected by the alumni and four had to be

30

under thirty-five years old. The faculty members were allowed to be on the
committees of the Board. Just lots of changes.
[00:49:11] The Board was enlarged from an old boys club to about thirty or
so. Now I don’t know to what extent that still exists. My guess is it does,
but I don’t know. Anyway, the Board changed. Stanford changed. Dick
became president and Bill Miller became the provost. Dick appointed Bill.
Bill was an engineer of some sort. Maybe computer science, I’m not sure.
Steinhart: What do you suppose ended that period of difficulty for Stanford?
Packer: [00:50:14] Well, I think a number of things. Did the draft continue?
Steinhart: No. It was essentially over in ’73.
Packer: [00:50:25] Yes, because that was one thing. There was no longer going to be
a draft. That was one thing. We were kind of, by then, pulling out of
Vietnam, not fast enough, but at some point. Yes, a lot of changes had been
made. A lot of the student demands had been met. I think also, it just began
to sink in to some of our students that this was not fun and games. People
were getting hurt.
[00:51:01] A kid, fourteen or fifteen, his father was a professor of history,
was over there fooling around, watching everything; he got shot in the leg.
There were madmen. They were not necessarily students. There were lots
besides students. There was Venceremos. There was H. Bruce Franklin
whom we haven’t mentioned.
Steinhart: We had two people, two houses across the street, that were Venceremos’
houses. The path across the corner of Max Crawford’s house was termed

31

“the Venceremos Trail” because at night you could see people carrying guns
and cutting across his lawn.
Packer: [00:51:44] Yes. A lot of faculty tried to make peace with them, but Ken
Kesey was hanging around. I never found it funny, to tell you the truth.
Steinhart: Yes, those were tough years. Really tough years.
Packer: [00:52:03] Yes.
Steinhart: Do you want to talk about Bruce Franklin just a little bit?
Packer: [00:52:08] Well, sure. Bruce Franklin was an associate professor of English.
His specialty was Melville, as I recall. He had been a member of SAC,
Strategic Air Command, before he came to Stanford. He was one of the first
faculty to become involved. He was not the only, but he was among the
first, and the most deeply involved faculty member at Stanford. Deeply
involved in the troubles. He was a commander of all that. Finally, Dick fired
him. You have to turn this off. [Laughs]
(The tape recorder is turned off for a few moments.)
Steinhart: One of the changes might be publication of the Study of Education at
Stanford’s proposal to change from the Academic Council to an Academic
Senate.
Packer: [00:53:26] After Herb got sick, Jim Gibbons took over SES, which was the
Study of Education at Stanford, and was very wide ranging. He and his
committee published the books. They made a big difference at Stanford in
terms of academics, but also in terms of governance. One thing that the SES
did was to recommend establishing a Faculty Senate. You couldn’t have
eight hundred people making decisions by vote. It was too complicated.

32

[00:54:13] You could have a Faculty Senate and each group would be
represented, but the faculty would have more real say with a Senate than they
could with the Academic Council where eight hundred people were voting.
That was major.
Steinhart: Can we back up a minute? Who voted in the Academic Council? Anyone
who was, what, tenured faculty?
Packer: [00:54:32] Any tenure-line faculty. Associate, assistant, whatever. Anybody.
Yes.
Steinhart: That had existed from the beginning?
Packer: [00:54:41] That had always been.
Steinhart: That’s a medieval institution.
Packer: [00:54:43] Yes. Yes. I guess it is. I don’t know. It was hard to do anything.
At one point, this university almost—I am just free-associating—this
university almost lost its entire top administrators because there was a vote
with the Academic Council. The university wanted to hold the students
responsible for having taken over the Old Union, and the Academic Council
had a vote and voted not to.
[00:55:18] At that point, Dick was ready to quit, Herb was ready to quit,
everybody was ready to quit. Wiser heads prevailed and they didn’t. What
they did was start inviting faculty members to dinner. [Laughs] Really.
There was a real effort at that point. We used to have dinner parties and
have faculty and trustees at them to stop this war between the faculty and the
trustees, with the administration caught in the middle.

33

[00:55:48] I think amity did help smooth things out a bit. They could see that
the trustees didn’t have horns, and the trustee could see that the faculty were
not totally irrational. Just a little. That made a major difference.
Steinhart: This sort of speaks to the question I was suggesting, that I am wondering
over these years how the level of civility amongst academic colleagues has
possibly changed over the years. It sounds like there was a period in which it
was pretty tough.
Packer: [00:56:24] Things were tough, yes. The faculty—everybody. They were
Commies and the others were Fascists. It was really uncivil. I don’t know
that there’s—in the old days, the faculty was small enough you knew a lot of
people. There was civility, certainly. After the troubles, when the university
had grown from 350 faculty to 800, this was an enormous time of change,
and I can give you some figures that I didn’t—
Steinhart: I think I read that in Sterling’s tenure, the tenured faculty tripled to over nine
hundred.
Packer: [00:57:03] Yes, just about tripled. That’s right. When you have 850, you’re
not going to be friendly—all friends. I think there is a lot of insularity now.
Steinhart: Are they also fighting over resources more?
Packer: [00:57:22] I don’t know. You mean now? I don’t know. I have no idea.
Steinhart: As the university grows, it’s sort of legendary that departments fight over
teaching positions, they fight over research space.
Packer: [00:57:30] Sure. When you had somebody like Terman, you could fight all
you want; you weren’t going to win. He was going to win. If chemistry was
angry because the billets weren’t filled and they were having to work harder,

34

they were having too many students in the classes, they could complain all
they wanted but they weren’t going to—it wasn’t going to happen. I think
power has shifted a bit. I think the Academic Senate has helped power to
shift.
[00:58:01] They are now talking about undergraduate freshman requirements
at the Faculty Senate right now. You couldn’t do that when you had the
Academic Council with so many people. So, yes, it has made a difference.
The faculty is, I think, much more powerful. I think two things have
happened that are contrary. The faculty is much more powerful and power
has shifted to the central administration.
[00:58:30] The faculty can do something about it if they want, but they are
also interested in their own little issues that they have let the central
administration become more powerful. I know that sounds like a
contradiction and maybe it is.
Steinhart: Not necessarily. It also means that, in a sense, something shifted away from
the trustees, too.
Packer: [00:58:47] Yes, that’s right. Absolutely. That’s the point, I guess, yes.
Steinhart: All in all, is this a more pleasant place to be than it was fifty years ago?
Packer: [00:59:00] I’m not here now. [Laughter]
