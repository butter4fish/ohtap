MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: March 28, 2011, and I’m here in Davis, California with Louise McClain,
and I’d like to ask you an easy question. Would you begin by telling me your
full name and where you were born?

MCCLAIN: Louise Evelyn McClain, and I was born in Denver, Colorado.

REDMAN: Oh, you were born in Denver, okay. How long did you live in Denver?

MCCLAIN: I lived in Denver really all my life until I was married, which would
have been when I was twenty-five, except for during World War II when I worked
in Columbus, Ohio.

REDMAN: Okay, okay. So can you tell me about, I’m sorry, can you remind me
what year you were born?

MCCLAIN: Nineteen twenty-four.

REDMAN: Nineteen twenty-four, okay, so when you were fairly young, the Great
Depression started.

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, so do you have some early recollections of the Great Depression in Denver?

MCCLAIN: Not really. It didn’t really hit us until about 1932. My father was a
bricklayer, and lo and behold there was no building going on, so it hit.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so, yeah, can you tell me a little bit about your parents,
what they were like. You mentioned your father was a bricklayer, and did your
mother have work as well, or -- ?

MCCLAIN: No, she was strictly a stay at home mother.

REDMAN: Okay, and what were they like as people? What do you remember about them?

MCCLAIN: Wonderful, my mother was an amazing person. She was a little lady, and
they asked her if she would go around collecting for Red Cross, and so she
decided to do it, and she even walked in the neighborhood bar, [laughs] this
little bitty lady in the neighborhood bar seeing if they wouldn’t donate. She
had more donations than anyone else in our district.

REDMAN: Is that right? Wow, okay, okay.

MCCLAIN: My father was a very quiet man, very much, but he did teach me a lot of
things and some of the old songs like, I don’t remember. I’ll think of it
later maybe.

REDMAN: Okay, and did you have any siblings?

MCCLAIN: Yes, I had one sister.

REDMAN: What’s her name?

MCCLAIN: Edna.

REDMAN: Okay, so then tell me a little bit about what it was like to grow up in
Denver. Do you have some favorite recollections? Did your family live in the
city of Denver proper, or did you live just outside of Denver?

MCCLAIN: No, we lived in the city of Denver proper in south Denver. Denver was
very I’ll have to say segregated, south Denver, east Denver, north Denver, and
so forth and we lived in south Denver, which was lily white, and most of the
Mexicans and Negroes lived in west Denver. There were some blacks in east
Denver, and also some very rich people. Some fairly wealthy people in south
Denver, but not as many.

REDMAN: But by and large the different neighborhoods were segregated.

MCCLAIN: Yes, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, then what was your elementary school like?

MCCLAIN: Well, it went only through sixth grade.

REDMAN: Okay, and I assume that was segregated as well. Is that correct?

MCCLAIN: No. We had probably one Jewish person, no blacks, a few Mexicans,
that’s it.

REDMAN: Okay, so there might have been some different groups going to school
with you when you were young.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, so what do you remember about going to school each day? What was
that like?

MCCLAIN: I loved it. I really enjoyed school. My sister almost scared me to
death when I said something about, “We’re going to take some kind of a test
tomorrow, it’s a city-wide test.” And she said, “A city-wide test!”
“Oh,” she said, “That’s terrible.” So when the teacher passed out the
papers I started to cry, and she came around and said, “What’s the
matter?” I said, “I can’t do this, this is a city-wide test.” She said,
“Let’s read the first one,” and it was very simple, and I knew it, so that
ended that.

REDMAN: So how old were you and your sister at that time?

MCCLAIN: I was six, and she was nine.

REDMAN: Okay, so she had a little influence over being able to scare you a
little bit.

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes, yes.

REDMAN: Play tricks, and okay. You said you enjoyed school. What was your
favorite subject, or what were your favorite things about school? What did you
enjoy about it?

MCCLAIN: I think I enjoyed most of the curriculum. I enjoyed gym, too, and I
don’t know, it’s hard to say which --

REDMAN: But you enjoyed basically every subject.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, and then how about the other children? What were some of your
early memories, or do you have any favorite early recollections about the other
kids at your school in Denver?

MCCLAIN: Well, one of my best friends, we went through kindergarten through
third grade, and then I skipped a half grade ahead and she didn’t, but we kept
in touch really all our lives. She’s no longer living now, but --

REDMAN: Okay, but you made some good friends.

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay. So then did you then transitioned into a junior high school?

MCCLAIN: Yes, seven, eighth and ninth grade.

REDMAN: Okay. Was that different from the elementary school in any --

MCCLAIN: Well, of course, we had changed rooms for every subject, and it was
much larger, I think around 700 children in the junior high, and I didn’t like
social, well, yes, I did. I think I still liked it all pretty much.

REDMAN: Okay, okay. How about your teachers? What were they like? Were they
particularly strict, or were they lenient and friendly, or how do you remember
your teachers?

MCCLAIN: Mostly lenient and friendly. There were some I remember in particular,
Miss McGucken, Mrs. McGucken, who was just wonderful, and she would assign us to
go to a I think it was a care home for children who had no place to go after
school until both parents got home in a very poor district, and she made sure
that there were some boys going with us, and not just all girls.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so you would volunteer then with these younger kids.

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes.

REDMAN: All right, excellent. Now tell me did your parents encourage you to stay
in school and to continue on going through the high school and maybe beyond, and
how far along in school did your parents go?

MCCLAIN: My parents both went through eighth grade. My father would have loved
to have gone longer. As a matter of fact, he purposely flunked eighth grade so
he could stay in school again, but his father was an Englishman, a brick mason
in England, and his oldest son had to be a mason, and there was no point in
going any further than eighth grade. So my father, he went ahead and was a brick
mason, which was a pity. It was a good brain wasted, I believe. He did beautiful
woodwork on carved small chests, made his own workbench, and you could have put
it in your living room and been proud of it. It was a little sad. My mother was
very poor, and they really needed her to go to work when she got through eighth grade.

REDMAN: Okay, so both of them had left school fairly early on, but encouraged
you to continue your studies.

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes, yes.

REDMAN: Do you think it was in part because they wanted themselves to continue
on -- ?

MCCLAIN: Yes. I’m sure it was for my father anyway.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then tell me about what a typical day would have been
like growing up with you and your parents. When would your father leave for
work? Do have any sort of memories of what your mother did for chores, or what
things were like around the house?

MCCLAIN: Immaculate. My father left, they were on a fairly rigid schedule. He
left I think around 6:30 in the morning, and always my mother had packed his
lunch for him. We left for school about 9:00, and we came home for lunch. We
were very close to the grade school. We came home for lunch, and she was always
there. Oh, once in a while a neighbor would come in, or we’d go to the
neighbor’s house for lunch, and their daughter would come to our house
sometimes, they’d trade, babysitting in other words.

REDMAN: Okay, so then can you tell me did you have a job at all? What was your
first job? Was your first job working in defense or did you work at all when you
were in junior high or high school at all?

MCCLAIN: High school, I lied about my age, you had to be sixteen to work, and I
lied about it, it was on my Social Security card for a long time, but I worked
at Penney’s as a sales girl.

REDMAN: Okay, is that right? How old were you, were you fifteen or fourteen?

MCCLAIN: Fifteen.

REDMAN: Okay, but you told them you were sixteen, okay, and this got on your
Social Security card.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, oh, that’s a funny story. All right, so then how did you like
working at Penney’s? What was that like?

MCCLAIN: It was all right. I had to learn that some of the sales ladies would
steal the sales from you anytime they could.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: They probably needed the money, but --

REDMAN: So you were paid on commission.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, partly.

REDMAN: Okay, that’s interesting in the era of the Great Depression working at
a department store. What was that like? Were people buying nice things, or were
people buying kind of everyday things at Penney’s? What sort of what was that
-- ?

MCCLAIN: Pretty much every day. I had one man customer that wanted to get his
wife a purse, and, of course, I showed him the most expensive one we had, and he
bought it.

REDMAN: Okay. So you’d sort of suggest this is what purse your wife my like,
and --

MCCLAIN: I think that he told me that she was a redhead, and I picked out a
brown purse, but I kind of thought that’s not very nice.

REDMAN: Okay, so did you get pretty good at that job, or did you like it, or -- ?

MCCLAIN: It was just a summer job.

REDMAN: Okay, so you were a little indifferent towards the type of work and,
okay. So then tell me about completing high school. What year did you graduate,
do you recall?

MCCLAIN: Nineteen forty-one.

REDMAN: Wow, okay, so December of 1941 would that have been your senior year of
high school when Pearl Harbor happened?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so almost before graduation.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: So tell me about what that was like, to be a senior in high school and
to have Pearl Harbor happen. Do you recall the day that Pearl Harbor happened?

MCCLAIN: I recall quite vividly. It was a Sunday, and my father always listened
to Keltenborn on the news, and I said, “Do we have to listen to him? He never
has anything to say anyway,” Smart aleck, about then it came on that we had
been bombed.

REDMAN: Wow, okay.

MCCLAIN: So I remembered that, and it made a huge difference in school. A lot of
boys were starting to enlist, or many of them joined ROTC. It was different.

REDMAN: Did a lot of the young men leave immediately? Would they have left in
December of 1941, or did most people in your school until after graduation to enlist?

MCCLAIN: Waited until after graduation.

REDMAN: Okay, so what about the young women who were graduating from high
school? What were many of them doing?

MCCLAIN: I think maybe a few more went into nursing. I don’t remember anyone
joining the Army, Navy, or I’m not even sure you could join the Marine Corps.

REDMAN: Right, yeah, the --

MCCLAIN: But their lives changed a lot less.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, now, tell me about, did you grow up attending church
services at all?

MCCLAIN: Yes. My parents didn’t. My mother sent us to Sunday School, and we
went to the Presbyterian Church.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so what was that like then growing up and attending Sunday
School, and then your parents, did they have sort of mixed feelings about
church, or -- ?

MCCLAIN: Well, I think my mother missed it. I don’t think my father, I don’t
know why, but he never, I mean if somebody got married in a church, he went, but
other than that, he didn’t.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, but they thought it was important for you to attend Sunday School?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, do you know why? Did they just think that it was an important part
of your education, or -- ?

MCCLAIN: No, I don’t know. My mother also wanted me to be married in a church.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so there was some --

MCCLAIN: Yeah, she missed it.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then I’m curious, did you have any friends or relatives
that signed up for the military right after Pearl Harbor?

MCCLAIN: I don’t remember any.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and then any friends or anything like that who were
immediately affected by the war, it seems like?

MCCLAIN: No.

REDMAN: Not right away.

MCCLAIN: One or two of the folks did join the Army as I recall. I had forgotten
that, but they did.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then tell me about what your high school graduation was
like. Do you recall graduating from high school or anything surrounding that?

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes.

REDMAN: Tell me a little bit about that.

MCCLAIN: Well, it was held in the downtown auditorium. My graduating class had
over 700 students.

REDMAN: So it was a large school.

MCCLAIN: Large school, yes. The girls all wore long white dresses, and the
fellows suits. Afterwards several of my girlfriends, their parents and my
parents all went out to get something to eat.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so the mood was still upbeat despite the fact that there was
war that had started. Now tell me about then what happened to you after
graduating high school.

MCCLAIN: I started Denver University right away.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and what were you studying at Denver?

MCCLAIN: Mathematics.

REDMAN: Interesting, okay, so why did you choose, now it seemed like you enjoyed
all different types of classes as a high school student, so what attracted you
to mathematics?

MCCLAIN: I guess, well I know, I just got to thinking about it, but that was my
easiest subject and that I did enjoy it, so I decided to major in math.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and what types of things do you remember learning, or what
types of classes do you remember taking early on at Denver?

MCCLAIN: One education course that I fell asleep. It was at 8:00 o’clock in
the morning, and the professor just covered the book, the chapter that you were
supposed to have read anyway, and he might as well as said it word for word. He
was terrible.

REDMAN: Okay, okay. But most of your professors were --

MCCLAIN: Yes, excellent.

REDMAN: Excellent, okay. Tell me a little bit about what it was like to be on a
university campus when my understanding is that many of the men would have left
by that time.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: So was that a little bit of a different feeling?

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes. There were a lot less men. But we also had Japanese people
that had been in the camps that they could go to college.

REDMAN: Okay, so there were Japanese Americans in your classes at Denver.

MCCLAIN: I didn’t happen to have any. There weren’t many of them. I do
remember that one boy, we called him Sunny because he was always smiling, and he
got a job cleaning the astronomy building, which wasn’t used much anymore.
They didn’t really have a good telescope. The FBI found out there was a
two-way radio there and said, “He’s got to go.” The two heads of the math
department, they used to take turns being heads decided that’s terrible. He
couldn’t get to Japan with that radio anyway, so they talked to the FBI and
said, “How about if we take the radio out.” They said, “Fine.” So he
kept his job.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so there was, one of the things that I’ve heard is that
there was a lot of suspicion about the Japanese at that time, but it’s hard to
kind of underestimate how people were talking about, oh, the Japanese as being
this sort of group to be feared in the United States during the war, and it
sounds like the FBI sort of played into that a little bit.

MCCLAIN: Yes, very much, yeah.

REDMAN: So did you at the time have any feelings about the Japanese being
interred, or was that sort of your first -- ?

MCCLAIN: I didn’t think it was fair, but I don’t think it bothered me. I
think it’s bothered me more in later years that they were.

REDMAN: Okay, but at the time you maybe you didn’t ponder it quite a much.

MCCLAIN: No. I was awfully glad that they stepped in in Sunny’s case.

REDMAN: Okay, so in the case that affected you personally, you were happy to
have him on campus, and it sounds like he was a --

MCCLAIN: Yes, thought it was ridiculous.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so tell me a little bit about then so you continued on at
Denver and then did you graduate from Denver University, or did you leave for
work first?

MCCLAIN: Well, I left, I went through my freshman year and started my sophomore
year, and then this program with Curtiss-Wright Aircraft came up, and I looked
into it. It seemed like an awfully good program, and by then the campus was
changing a lot, lots of the men were leaving, and so I signed up for the
Curtiss-Wright program. They took 700 girls, their engineering departments were
depleting because of the draft, and sent approximately 100 girls to seven
different colleges. This gets into my whole life during the war practically. It
was a very good program. I ended up at the University of Minnesota. They also
used Ohio State, Iowa State, Purdue, Rensselaer. I wanted to go to Rensselaer
but I didn’t get there. I didn’t have, they wanted everyone to have two
years of math or science, I’d only had a year and one quarter in my sophomore
year, and so I did go. They paid all our tuition, our board and room.

REDMAN: Do you remember how you found out about this program?

MCCLAIN: A friend of mine had heard about it and told me, and, of course, she
was excited because that was a Big Ten school.

REDMAN: Right, yeah, yeah. I want to ask one more question about Denver, you
mentioned that the campus was changing. Then after maybe ’42, on into ’43 on
your sophomore year, can you tell me a little bit about, so obviously many of
the men were leaving. How did that change sort of feeling on campus? Did you
sort of, you had a need it seems like to do something else.

MCCLAIN: Probably. Social things when there weren’t enough men to go around
weren’t as fun.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: Yeah.

REDMAN: Yeah. I guess there was a popular song around that era that joked that
all of the men were either too old or too young, that for the girls to go to
dances --

MCCLAIN: Yeah, I don’t remember the song.

REDMAN: Okay, that sounds about right, okay.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, oh, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so you ended up at the University of Minnesota taking
classes and Curtiss-Wright through this program was paying for the tuition.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Do you remember then your recollections of, you were on the Minneapolis campus.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, and do you remember what that was like?

MCCLAIN: Well, it’s a huge campus. We entered, our whole schedule was
different from a regular campus because we went to school all day, for one
thing, and for ten months straight. We entered I think the last of January or
first of February that year.

REDMAN: In ’43?

MCCLAIN: In ’43, yeah.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: Went through the summer, oh, and they paid for our transportation, too,
from Denver, from wherever we came. There were girls from all over.

REDMAN: Okay, so then you’d take ten months’ worth of fairly intensive, or
very intensive it sounds like, math and engineering courses or what -- ?

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes, yes, drafting and strength of materials.

REDMAN: Wow, okay, and was it entirely women in the course?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: Entirely.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then you would take all of your classes together with
this group of women over the course of ten months.

MCCLAIN: Yes. We were divided into four groups, depending on where the, what
we’d had and so forth.

REDMAN: Okay. So did you just show them your transcripts, or tell them about
what you were interested in, or do you know kind of how people would get
funneled into some of these particular channels?

MCCLAIN: No, I don’t. I really don’t remember.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so you’d maybe say that you were a math major and you’d
show them your list of courses that you’d taken or you’d explain what
you’d taken and they’d put you into a class or something like that?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then what were the professors like that were teaching you there?

MCCLAIN: Some of them were almost a little afraid of us. They hadn’t had many
women at all.

REDMAN: Oh, wow, okay, and then suddenly you’ve got a room full of women, an
auditorium full of women.

MCCLAIN: Most of them were just wonderful to us. In fact, I had dropped calculus
when I left. I’d started that quarter, but I hadn’t gotten very far, were
getting to integral calculus, which is quite hard, and I dropped it, and my
professor said, “Oh, I hate to see you drop it. Why don’t you just send me
in the assignments, and he gave them to me, and he said if you do that I can
give you a grade.” So I did, and I got into trouble when I was at Minnesota on
the assignment. I walked into Professor {Turreton’s?} math class with my long
face. [laughter]

REDMAN: Right, yeah.

MCCLAIN: And he said, “Is there a problem?” I said, “There are a lot of
problems, and I can’t do them,” and explained that I was going to quit. But
I just couldn’t carry that, and he said, “Oh, don’t do that. I’ll help you.”

REDMAN: Wow.

MCCLAIN: He helped me pass that calculus course.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so some of the math was quite challenging.

MCCLAIN: Yes, it was.

REDMAN: Okay, so trying to push some of the limits of what you were able to --

MCCLAIN: Well, this was the course in Denver.

REDMAN: Okay, oh, okay.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, so, but no, I don’t think they were that challenging actually.

REDMAN: Okay, when you got into the classes at Minnesota they were fairly
straightforward in this program.

MCCLAIN: Yes, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, now how about some of the other girls that were with you? Were
they mostly college women like yourself who then had left their programs in
order to do this?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then tell me a little bit about, Denver does have a
fairly mild climate at 300 days of sunshine a year, then going to Minneapolis in
January or February of 1943, was that a little bit of a shock?

MCCLAIN: Yes, it was. You had to walk on the sidewalks because there were banks
four feet high on either side.

REDMAN: Ice and snow, yeah.

MCCLAIN: That was a funny thing there; they were also tons of servicemen there.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: Navy bakers, meteorologists, everybody, and they marched to classes.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: If you happened to be walking to classes, you just had to stand still
when they went by you, so there were about four or five of us walking together,
and then here came somebody, I’m not sure, I think it was a meteorologist, and
they got all through us and their sergeant or whatever he was just couldn’t
resist, he called, “To the rear, march,” and took them back through.

REDMAN: That’s so funny. So people were still having a little bit of a good
time on campus, okay.

MCCLAIN: Oh, sure, yeah.

REDMAN: So, yeah, what was that like having all of those servicemen around on
campus when you were in the midst, because they were taking classes there as
well, too, is that correct?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, but not necessarily in your program.

MCCLAIN: No, no, not at all.

REDMAN: Okay, so they were completely separated but taking classes on the campus
at the same time. So did you feel like a normal college student there for a
little while, or did you feel more or less like you were in this program on campus?

MCCLAIN: I think we felt like college students.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: I think the meteorologist, their leader, whoever he was, came over and
said, “Could we arrange some blind dates?” So we did, and it worked out.

REDMAN: Okay, so every once in a while you’d go out on dates or your friends
would go out on dates with people on campus.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, that’s wonderful. So I wanted to ask then so you finished this
program, so that would have been maybe in the summertime or a little later?

MCCLAIN: A little later, almost Christmas time.

REDMAN: Almost Christmas time, okay. So then, I’m sorry, did you say there was
an eleven month program?

MCCLAIN: Ten month. Ten month.

REDMAN: Ten month, okay, so maybe from February to December in ’43. So then
what happens to you then after you complete this program?

MCCLAIN: Well, they paid for our train fare back home, and for most of us it
worked out that we were there for Christmas, not for all. They wanted to space
the girls going in to the engineering department, all set for Curtiss-Wright at
Columbus, Ohio, which made the Helldiver, which was a scout bomber, SB2C5, and
also were working on a little scout plane. What was my train of thought?

REDMAN: So you took the train back to Denver for Christmas. Were you one of the
ones that made it back for Christmas that year?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, and what was the mood at Christmas like then seeing your parents
after having been away in Minneapolis for some time and then about to leave and
go to Columbus, Ohio?

MCCLAIN: I think upbeat.

REDMAN: You were happy to see them, okay.

MCCLAIN: Maybe they were happy to see me go. No, I think they were just awfully
glad I got to come back for Christmas, but they thought it was a good program.

REDMAN: Okay, so they were proud of your decision to take part in it.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Did you see it already as even before going into the factory, did you
see it as part of the war effort, or were you thinking more about furthering
your education?

MCCLAIN: No, it was part of the war effort.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so had the war not been going on, you probably would have
stayed at Denver.

MCCLAIN: Right.

REDMAN: Okay, okay. So then following Christmas then you and the other girls who
had completed this program went to the Curtiss-Wright Factory at Columbus, Ohio,
is that correct?

MCCLAIN: That’s correct, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, so what were some of your impressions of signing up for the job
and officially arriving in Columbus, what was that like?

MCCLAIN: A little hard. I think that’s where we got some resentment from the
men that were there. They didn’t think we could do the work, and some of them
were wonderful, but some could be a little nasty.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, yeah. One of the questions I wanted to ask is how the men
and women interacted because I’ve gotten a number of stories that there was
either sexism or hanky panky or all different types of interaction, friendships
or positive relationships, but most of those people I talked to had been on the
line, on the assembly line. But from my understanding were you guys in the same
building as the assembly line, or were you working on engineering plans and
drafting completely separate from -- ?

MCCLAIN: The engineering room was completely separate, but you could go out on
the line any time you wanted to take a walk through or something.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: You couldn’t, to go out on a flight deck, you had to have a permit
from the Chief Engineer. I’ll tell you more about that later.

REDMAN: Sure, yeah. So then some of the engineers, some of the male engineers,
resented this new group of young women, okay, and how did that manifest itself?
You said some of them could be a little nasty. Would they say anything in particular?

MCCLAIN: One I remember was talking to the draftsmen or the head, whose table
was right in front of mine, and I don’t remember what he said, but it was very
insulting, and I was so mad I just slammed my pencil down. He and I became quite
friendly friends after a while. [laughter]

REDMAN: Okay, okay.

MCCLAIN: I was mad.

REDMAN: Yeah, that’s a good story. I mean at the time that must have been so
frustrating. All right, so we were talking about the one male engineer, but you
said that the two of you actually became pretty good friends eventually.

MCCLAIN: Yeah, yeah.

REDMAN: Or a good working relationship.

MCCLAIN: Yes, good working relationship.

REDMAN: Okay, okay.

MCCLAIN: There was some hanky panky. Most of it I didn’t know about until
later, and one made me very unhappy. There was a girl in my group, I worked in
landing gear and hydraulics, and she was almost totally deaf. She wore two
hearing aids, and she could understand men’s lower voices and she could
understand me pretty well, but I really liked her, and this one married man just
took advantage of her loneliness, I felt.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: So it caused a lot of trouble. His wife found out about it, and so
forth and so forth.

REDMAN: Okay, I’ve heard some stories about how it was a real challenge for
women who they may have had boyfriends or fiancés or husbands who then went
away for war. Did you see any of that, or was that maybe the main story that
stuck in your mind as far as loneliness --

MCCLAIN: No, one of my very good friend’s husband, he wasn’t sent overseas
yet but was scheduled to go, and quite a few, we only had one married woman, and
her husband was in the service, too. Yes, a lot of them had boyfriends in the service.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: My boyfriend was an engineer, so he was not in the service.

REDMAN: Can you tell me how you met your boyfriend at about that time?

MCCLAIN: No, actually I had met him in Denver before I left, yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and he remained behind in Denver.

MCCLAIN: Well, for about a year longer until, or two years until he graduated,
but then he ended up in Ithaca, New York.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so we can get to that in a bit. I want to ask you about the
engineering room. You had mentioned that you worked in landing gear and
hydraulics, and could you just walk me through, draw me a little bit of a
picture of the engineering room was like? There would be these large drafting
tables, was that correct?

MCCLAIN: That’s correct.

REDMAN: How large were, I’ve seen some for ships, engineering rooms for ships
where there would be these massive drafting tables with the entire plan on the
ship, and you’d take off your socks and shoes and actually stand on the
drafting table. But for planes were they large desks placed around, and how was
it divided up, what did the engineering room look like?

MCCLAIN: The engineering room was full almost entirely of drafting tables. I was
just looking at my dining table, about that long, but, of course, they tip up.

REDMAN: Yeah, so maybe about six feet long.

MCCLAIN: Um hm.

REDMAN: Then they would tip up, okay. Now would there be a section for landing
gear and hydraulics, and a section for the other different components of the plane?

MCCLAIN: Yes, but it wasn’t, there were no partitions or anything. It was just
that all the landing gear and hydraulics was in about two rows and so forth.

REDMAN: Okay. Once a plane has been designed, what would an engineer like you do
at a factory, would you double check to make sure that the designs were being
accurately implemented? Or tell me about what an engineer would do?

MCCLAIN: Well, when I was there they were on the fifth model of the Helldiver
and were starting to work on the sixth.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: So there was always new work to be done, and on the little scout plane
that was just in the experimental stage and so there was work on that, too.

REDMAN: Okay, now I’ve seen it referred to as well as the hell cat or
Helldiver --

MCCLAIN: Correct.

REDMAN: That was used primarily by the Navy, is that correct?

MCCLAIN: Yes, it’s a Navy plane entirely.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and it was meant to carry one or two large bombs.

MCCLAIN: I believe just one large bomb.

REDMAN: Just one large bomb, and it would dive down, it was mainly to be used in
the Pacific, is that right?

MCCLAIN: That’s correct.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so did you know some of this coming in, what the goals of
the plane were, what it was meant to do? Or did you just sort of learn about
what the function of the aircraft was as you were working as an engineer?

MCCLAIN: I think just picked it up.

REDMAN: Okay, so people would tell you this thing or the other thing about the
plane, or, okay, let’s go back to arriving and signing up for work. Did you
sign up for a union at all?

MCCLAIN: No, there were very few union people in there, it wasn’t, and I
didn’t sign up for --

REDMAN: Okay, okay, now how about a health care plan? Was there -- ?

MCCLAIN: No.

REDMAN: Okay, let’s turn back, so there was some union activity at the plant.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, but it was pretty limited?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, so maybe some people were required to sign up for a union, but
they didn’t actively maybe play a role in the unions or anything like in the
plant or maybe just not that you saw, or --

MCCLAIN: I know they didn’t in the engineering department. Whether they did in
the plant, I don’t know.

REDMAN: Okay, okay. So then tell me a little bit more about the dynamic in the
engineering room, so what on a day to day basis what sort of thing does someone
who is working on drafts of a design of landing gear or hydraulics, what would
you do?

MCCLAIN: Well, hydraulics, you might be designing a bracket to hold the
spaghetti, we called it, and I was just I think I finally had a junior engineer
rating, but I didn’t do any of the real design work.

REDMAN: Okay, I’ve heard of frequently the military coming back to many of
these plants and factories, it would seem to make sense that representatives
from the Navy would periodically come to the engineering room and say, “These
are some of the things that we want to work on on the fifth model or the fourth
model of the diver.” Would they suggest improvements, or how would that sort
of be implemented? How would they improve the plane?

MCCLAIN: I think their meeting would be with the Chief Engineer and a few of his
immediate followers. It didn’t get down to me, except I’m sure that they
came along and said, “We want to change this,” and I didn’t really wonder why.

REDMAN: Okay, so you just saw some of these things as general improvements to --

MCCLAIN: Yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so then how did you commute to work each day? What was your
living situation like?

MCCLAIN: Oh, I lived with three other women in an apartment, and we were fairly
close to the plant on the outskirts of Columbus really, and one of my lead men
gave me a ride every day.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so there was an active share the ride program at the --

MCCLAIN: Oh, definitely, yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, so people would commute together.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, now so you said you lived with three girls who worked at the plant.

MCCLAIN: That’s right

REDMAN: Did you guys then share rationing, or how did your rationing work for a
group of young women, you might get so much milk or butter or margarine or, do
you recall how that worked? Or did you have a system in your house?

MCCLAIN: No, I think we had a great plenty of, I don’t remember.

REDMAN: Okay, so do you remember rationing at all?

MCCLAIN: Yes, I do remember, we did want more sugar, but one of the girls that
lived in Columbus, her mother had plenty and shared it with us.

REDMAN: So if you maybe didn’t have quite enough sugar, you could find someone
who would be able to share a little.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: All right, so let’s talk about, we talked a little bit about how the
plant was mixed in terms of gender in the engineering room. How about, do you
have sort of a general recollection of how about race? Were there mainly white
people who were in the engineering room?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Almost exclusively?

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, and then how about on the actual assembly line? Do you recall if
that was --

MCCLAIN: I think there were some blacks on there, but not a lot.

REDMAN: Okay, okay.

MCCLAIN: Columbus at that time was awfully close to the South and in their
thinking they were.

REDMAN: Okay. I’m sorry, can you move your hand? So, I’m sorry, you said
Columbus was awfully close to the South. So were you getting a lot of people
coming up to Columbus from the South seeking jobs?

MCCLAIN: I think there were probably closer jobs than Columbus.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so how about the pay at Curtiss-Wright? Were most people
pretty satisfied with the salaries that they were getting for work?

MCCLAIN: I think so.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, and how about yourself? Did you feel like this was a good
paying job, or is that something that wasn’t really on your radar or something
you weren’t paying as much attention to?

MCCLAIN: I don’t think any of us were paying, the jobs we’d had always been
just summer jobs, and it seemed very good really.

REDMAN: Right, so for many of the girls this would have been their first real
permanent job.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so that must have been, to a certain extent do you feel like
people were learning on the job to what extent they could and kind of learning
as you go along in the engineering room?

MCCLAIN: Oh, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, so what sorts of things were you trying to pick up, or what sort
of things were you trying to learn from --

MCCLAIN: Well, I really wanted to learn exactly how a hydraulic system worked.
Don’t think I ever felt very capable on that. [laughter]

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: Then I learned to improve my drafting a great deal.

REDMAN: Okay, did you feel like that was through practice?

MCCLAIN: Yes, mostly practice, yes.

REDMAN: Okay, so you would be asked to draft and redraft some of the small
design changes that were critical to the aircraft, but tell me about what the
other sections of the engineering room might have been, so you were working in
landing gear and hydraulics. Do you recall what some of the other engineers were
working on?

MCCLAIN: I surely should. Well, the bomb bay and the bomb equipment for holding
the bomb, and, goodness, electrical systems, and the whole, the firewall and the
sides of the plane.

REDMAN: So that’s a pretty diverse range of jobs, going from bomb equipment to
the hydraulics, so were you assigned to landing gear and hydraulics, or was that
something that you chose, or -- ?

MCCLAIN: No, I was assigned to it.

REDMAN: Okay.

MCCLAIN: Yeah.

REDMAN: Okay, and how do you feel like that compared as a job to these other
sorts of jobs that some of the other engineers were doing?

MCCLAIN: About the same, for the girls, I mean for the cadets we were called.

REDMAN: Okay. Oh, that’s interesting. Do you know why they called you cadets?

MCCLAIN: It started with the schooling. We were the Curtiss-Wright cadets.

REDMAN: Curtiss-Wright cadets, okay, okay. So can you tell me then do you
remember, I’ll close on this question for this tape, so most of the senior
engineers then would have been men.

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Was it almost exclusively men who were already in the plant who then
were at a higher rank than these young women engineers who came in through this
Curtiss-Wrights cadets program, and that must have had, we’ve talked a little
bit about the relationships that that may have brought about or there might have
been some resentment. Can you just comment a little bit more on what, were some
of the men equal, maybe some of the men were quite gruff, but were some of the
men pretty easy to work with, or did they like having young people working with
them, or -- ?

MCCLAIN: I think most of them did. My final job was to draw the final hydraulic
system on the Helldiver. The engineers cannot place every hydraulic tube. It has
to go to the experimental shop because it’s, there’s just too many of them
and trying to get in a narrow space and all, so that we had to do the final job
on that. I worked with one of the engineers on that, and he was great.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, so by and large most of them were supportive and --

MCCLAIN: Yes.

REDMAN: Okay, okay, well with that I’ll change the tape and ask some other questions.
