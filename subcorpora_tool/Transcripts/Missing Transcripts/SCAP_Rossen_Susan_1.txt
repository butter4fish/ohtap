SUSAN FRIEBERT ROSSEN

by: 	ELLICE AMANNA


AMANNA: 	Okay.  So this is Ellice Amanna and I'm conducting an interview with Susan Friebert Rossen, class of '63.  It's May 25th, 2013, and this is the Smith College Alumnae Oral History Project.   Thank you for participating. 
ROSSEN:	I'm happy to do that. 
AMANNA:	So you're here for reunion. 
ROSSEN:	Mm-hmm.
AMANNA:	And you're part of the group that prepared your class for this.  Do you come back often for reunion? 
ROSSEN:	I actually taught in the SIAMS program.  Do you know what that is?  It's the Summer Institute for Art Museum at Smith, so SIAMS.
AMANNA:	Oh, great.  Yeah. 
ROSSEN:	And it started seven years ago now.  And the first year I didn’t participate, the next four years I did.  And then the last year I didn’t participate.  And so I came every summer and it was really a terrific experience.  I was also in something called the Smith Management program which was something that I did in the early I'd say '90 – 1990, something like that.  That was a program that I think has changed is name now, but it was to prepare middle management women for leadership jobs.  And I was a museum publisher.  I did books for an art museum, and a lot of that involvement management of finances because these book budgets were enormous and you had to really think about not only raising enough money to do them but also try to figure out whether you could profit from them in any way, shape or form, even though museums are nonprofit.  And I thought – I really didn’t think I had business skills.  I mean Smith gave me a great deal of my background in art history and in art, and in writing, but it didn’t give me any at that point.  Who was thinking about anything like that?  
So I applied and I was probably one of the only – at that point there were a couple of other nonprofits in this program, but mostly they were people from big corporations who could afford to send these middle management women for accruing skills that would help them break the glass ceiling.  And so that program has now ended, but there's a different one in the summer, and I don’t know what it's called.  SIAMS ended this past year.  It's over. 
AMANNA:	Okay.  
ROSSEN:	And I think that's really sad, but I understand that Smith now has a museum concentration which I think is just fine, and so it really maybe isn't needed anymore. 
AMANNA:	Okay.  
ROSSEN:	So it brought me back to Smith – I've been back in all those ways – and made me even more attached to it than I was before. 
AMANNA:	Yeah. 
ROSSEN:	I credit the college for an education at a level that really prepared me to do what I did in my life.  And I was overwhelmed when I came here.  Our class was the first class to be half public and half private schools.  Nonetheless, many of the public school kids went to schools like Latin in Boston and the Philadelphia School for Girls which is a public school but high-level academic achievers.
AMANNA:	Right.
ROSSEN:	And I was the first girl from my high school to go out East to college, so I came out here completely unprepared. 
AMANNA:	And where did -- 
ROSSEN:	Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
AMANNA:	Oh, okay.
ROSSEN:	And I came here because I got the biggest scholarship.  I mean I have no idea why I picked Smith, but I think it was because I was most honored to get more money from Smith than from the other schools that I applied to.  And so I didn’t know what I was walking into, and that first year was really hard.  I took art history 1-1, as they called it then, and that was the only class I did well in, and the other classes I struggled, because I'd never written a blue book test.  I really had never been taught how to write essays.  I didn’t know how to take notes.  In a class I was just thrown in what I thought were very beautiful sharks, these women, you know, that I was suddenly colleagues with, and I was overwhelmed.  And I write in the essay that I put in the reunion book that I was so overwhelmed that I studied all the time and I didn’t realize it till I came back last summer to do some research to be the editor of the reunion book for our class, and I went through The Sophian, every issue, as I told you, newspaper and saw the kinds of privilege that we had in those four years, what we were given by this school.  
I mean did I know that Martin Luther spoke at chapel in the Fall of 1959?  No.  Did I know that Ella Fitzgerald sang?  Did I know that the Cleveland Symphony came?  Did I know that José Limón, a great dancer, came and taught master classes?  No.  I am not aware of ever having gone to a single one of those things.  And it wasn’t like I was culturally naïve.  My father and mother are both artists and both interested in ballet and both interested in classical music, and so it's not like I didn’t come from no experience of that at all, but I think that I was just so overwhelmed by just trying to stay above water that I just studied all the time.  And I ended up becoming a workaholic in my entire life, so that I don’t thank Smith for but – I don’t blame Smith for that.  
	Anyway, art history was the one course.  It was taught at that point by a number of different people who all were famous and outstanding art historians, and they used the Smith College Museum.  They made us look at real works of art.  They didn’t just show us slides in black and white illustrations, although we had beautiful ones taken by a man named Kindy (phonetic) whose wife – they were both renaissance scholars, and he became a great photographer.  And we would have this packet of black-and-white illustrations that we'd have to study and memorize, and I kept them for years because they were such beautiful photographs.  And so we did study from black and white and we were disadvantaged that way, but we had a collection at this museum which was a terrific museum.  For a school this size it was pretty fabulous.  And that interested me a lot in the objects themselves, you know, and really becoming involved with the objects.  And of course I came from artists, my parents both being artists, so I wasn’t too afraid of the object and I was really interested in that. 
	So I ended up getting a master's degree and going into museum work, and my museum work was always educational.  I really believed in communicating my own enthusiasms, and partly because I had such great teachers here.  I mean they are the ones that – I had never known there was such as a thing as art history, even with the family I lived in.  Even with all the books my father had and my mother had to look at, I don’t think I ever knew that there was a course of study that you could actually do.  So between that and the fact that I went on my junior year to Paris where I studied at the Ecole du Louvre, and of course there I was just thrown into art and architecture and everything, those were just total defining things that Smith did for me and led me into the museums as a life.  
	And so I started an education, which I love doing, and then I took some time off to have a child, and then I got divorced and that was another big swerve in my life, and I had to start earning a living, so I went back to the museum.  And this is in Detroit, Michigan where I was living because the man I married lived there.  And the Detroit Institute of Arts is one of the great unsung museums in the United States and now is under incredible siege because the city is bankrupt.  And actually, yesterday it made headlines because the bankruptcy officer that the state assigned to run the city – the city can't run itself now – has decided that the Detroit Institute of Arts collection is worth so many millions of dollars that maybe in fact they could begin to sell some of it off in order to make – 
AMANNA:	Oh, what a heartbreak. 
ROSSEN:	Unbelievable.  I mean it's unheard of.  So I don't know how they're going to fight that back.  But anyway, it's a great museum and I worked there first in education, then I worked as a curator, and these were days when you didn’t have to have a Ph.D. to do that kind of work.  Now you do.  And then I ended up, because the museum director, I had been editing him – he couldn’t write his way out of a paper bag, and he would give me essays to write – help him – well, then I would rewrite them, and he said, you have a gift, and I said, no, I don’t really, and he said, yes you do.  We need to start a department that publishes and you need to be in charge of it.  And I said, I can't do that.  I can't.  And I don’t even know what that means.  And he said, you'll find out.  So he threw me into the water and I swam and created this career, as many people in publishing do.  You don't – in those days for sure, you didn’t get trained to do publishing.  You maybe majored in English and maybe you went to New York and started as a secretary in a publishing house, but for the most part people just fell into those jobs.  They have more training now than they used to.  And so I created a department there which edited labels, edited all materials having to do with art, and edited and produced books.  And eventually I went to Chicago to the Art Institute of Chicago which is a much more wealthy museum and a more famous museum, although I won't under-salute DIA ever.  It's just a great place.  And I stayed there for --
