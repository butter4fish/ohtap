I’m here on August 24, with Marion
Gabler, and this is our first tape. Usually the way we start out is just by
asking you your full name and where and when you were born.

GABLER: Full name, Marion Gabler. Born in Freeport, Michigan. What else?

STEIN: When?

GABLER: Oh. January 7, 1924.

STEIN: Okay, now tell me a little bit about your family. You said you came from
a large family?

GABLER: Well, I was the first, and over the years my mother had different men
and different kids, and when she finally got married the last time, why, she had
seven with one fellow. So they were all back in Michigan, or most of them
anyway, and I go back there for the family reunion.

STEIN: Did you all grow up in the same house? Was everyone living together?

GABLER: Oh, yeah. Back in those days the mother got the kids, so no question. No
question. The men disappeared.

STEIN: Did they all just travel on, or what?

GABLER: Well, when I was born my father was in prison, and by the time he got
out, she had another baby. That’s just the way it went.

STEIN: How many brothers and how many sisters?

GABLER: Well, let’s see. I had four brothers before I had any sisters. I was
almost seventeen when I finally got a sister. So I had three sisters and five brothers.

STEIN: Okay. Did you have a lot of responsibilities, the oldest sibling?

GABLER: Oh, it didn’t seem like it at the time. When we lived up north we were
expected to pick the potato bugs off of the potatoes. That was a big chore we
didn’t like. We had to harness the horse and go out into what they called the
slashings and pick up pine knots, which now I remember with pleasure, but then
we’d holler, “Oh, there isn’t any more pine knots out there.” But it was
a good life. Back then you participated with everything with your family. There
was nobody else within miles, so that was good.

STEIN: Did you grow up on a farm?

GABLER: Part of the time. I went to two schools every year, so I was in the
cities, I was in the farm. In this picture, I’m about three, and I was living
on my grandfather’s farm. That’s it, my mother would bring us back to
grandpa and grandma. She’s get a nice place to live, she’d go bring us back.
We could say, “Hi, Grandma and Grandpa,” and “Goodbye,” with the same
anticipation. I’m sure they got very lonely at times.

STEIN: Where did your grandma and grandpa live? Was it close by in Michigan?

GABLER: Two or three different towns, but in Michigan, the same area.

STEIN: So they had a farm.

GABLER: They had a farm most of the time until he finally retired.

STEIN: Do you know what they used to grow?

GABLER: Well, yeah. He had horses, and they grew rotated crops. I still can’t
go back to Michigan and look at the field after field of corn, field after field
of soybeans, never anything else. You know they’re using all kinds of
fertilizers. It isn’t good for the soil.

STEIN: Certainly not.

GABLER: When I grew up we had a manure spreader, we loaded it, we took the
manure out to the fields. He planted corn one year, wheat the next, and maybe
two or three years of hay. But it was all called rotation of crops, and I
don’t think he ever bought fertilizer.

STEIN: Were there ever blights or crop problems because that, or do you remember?

GABLER: Well, no, I don’t remember it, but during the Depression my mother
said he took the potatoes out of the basement, throwed them on the manure
spreader and took them out in the field and spread them rather than to sell them
for like, I don’t know what, ten cents a bushel or whatever. He wouldn’t
sell them for the price that he could get, and that was during the Depression.
But us kids was always happy. We were always well fed. We didn’t know there
was a Depression. I didn’t know about those children running in the streets
with no families in Chicago, which was probably 150 miles away. I didn’t know
anything about that until I was a lot older, into adulthood.

STEIN: Do you remember any changes that were caused by the Depression or having
an awareness of it in any way?

GABLER: Well, yeah, my grandparents had started bank accounts, and I think we
got cheated out of two bucks or something. It was enough that I had heard about
it, but it wasn’t very much money. [laughs] My grandmother had egg money for
groceries, and he had the milk money for whatever farm costs there was. They
worked hard.

STEIN: Were they born in Michigan, or do you know how they came to --

GABLER: They lived in West Virginia when my mother was born and moved to
Michigan, I think, because my grandfather’s brother had married my
grandmother’s sister, and they were up here in Michigan, and it sounded like a
good place for farmers. He hadn’t been a farmer, but they came up here and
eventually got a farm.

STEIN: I guess they learned real quick.

GABLER: Well, he probably grew up on one, but in West Virginia a farm is rock
piles and a little field about as big as this, and another hill and another
little field, not farming like they do here in Michigan. But he had been a --
they built framework for stone quarries, so a framework for a stone quarry is
just like a barn structure. So he was a carpenter before he became a farmer.

STEIN: Oh, wow.

GABLER: But I spent a lot of time on their various farms. [shows photographs] I
kept this one because here’s where I’m three on one of grandpa’s farms.
Here I’m probably twelve or thirteen on another of grandpa’s farm. There
I’m -- There I’m very pregnant for my first child. My husband was in
service, and here’s where I worked at the bomber plant.

STEIN: Oh, wow.

GABLER: That’s the only picture I’ve got of that time in the factory --

STEIN: You’ve got nice pants on. That probably wasn’t very common for women, right?

GABLER: That was start, nobody --  You couldn’t buy women’s pants before the war.

STEIN: Did they start making women’s pants, or did you have to wear men’s pants?

GABLER: I think by the time I got in the bomber plant they were making slacks.
We never saw a woman in a bandana before the war. I do have my badge on in that picture.

STEIN: Oh, yeah. Gosh, this picture of you is precious as a three-year-old, with
your legs crossed all lady-like. [laughter] Well, I guess to stay sort of in the
thirties, did your mother work ever?

GABLER: She was a housekeeper. That’s how she met these various men. [laughs]
She always took the kids, once she’d get established, she’d take us kids.
That’s why we moved around so much.

STEIN: Okay, did you ever live in other homes?

GABLER: Sure, every time she got a different job as a housekeeper. This is where
I graduated from high school, very poor picture. But we lived on three acres
with tents like gypsies, and we had a party for my graduation. This is my
grandma and grandpa. We had a party out there. We were just as happy in those
tents, as later on my dad built a house, but he got the house up but not
finished inside before he was drafted. So he was in the Navy at the same time my
husband was.

STEIN: What theater did your father serve in?

GABLER: He was a Seabee.

STEIN: That’s a construction battalion?

GABLER: Well, I think so. When I knew where he was, he was around Mississippi,
down around the gulf. He had something to do with the Navy, so I don’t know
whether -- I thought they were constructing. He ended up in the hospital, and I
don’t remember now what that was either, but --

STEIN: So it sounds like you moved around a whole bunch as a child with your big family.

GABLER: Oh, yeah. Two schools a year except maybe two.

STEIN: Was it the same schools? Did you go back and forth, or it was a different
school every time.

GABLER: It was off with Mom to a different school. Back to Grandma’s to the
same country school. Off with Mom to some other. Back to Grandma’s. For a
while it was always the same country school when we was with the grandparents.

STEIN: But a different school when you were with your mom. What was it like
living in these other people’s home? Was that --

GABLER: It was always home. Just like this. This is home. If I hang my hat here,
it’s home. If I don’t hang my hat there, it means I’m not comfortable, and
it’s not home.

STEIN: Were you usually comfortable in the home --

GABLER: Oh, yeah. We had a happy childhood, none of this psychiatric looking
back and blaming somebody else for all your troubles.

STEIN: Did you have to work yourself as a young person?

GABLER: No. I think I got my first job when I was probably in twelfth grade, and
I was a babysitter one summer.

STEIN: You never had to work in the home alongside your mother.

GABLER: Well, when you say work, you plant a garden, you can, you maybe dust
once in a while, help with the laundry. Those kind of things weren’t work.
When you think of work in those days, you was getting paid for it and doing it
somewhere else. We’d walk several miles to pick strawberries, in one area we
could pick strawberries. Another area, we walked so far and got a ride and
picked string beans. Those were just like a week or two now and maybe never
happened again. So it was always friendly, always fun.

STEIN: It sounds like a nice job.

GABLER: Well, it was. My mother never worried about anything, and so why did we?
I don’t know how we got back and forth to Grandma’s as often as we did. Some
of those times we didn’t have a car.

STEIN: Yeah, do you remember hitchhiking or taking a bus?

GABLER: No, we was there. She probably found somebody with a car. I can remember
my -- we were three years apart, me and my first brother. I was probably eight
when Ma and her present husband pulled in, and she got out of the car with a
baby. I can still remember hollering, “Mama’s got a baby, Mama’s got a
baby.” I run across the yard. Oh, my brother had been with her because he
wanted to go play, and I wanted to hang around and hold that baby. That was the
third brother.

STEIN: That must have been quite a surprise. Didn’t know he was on the way.

GABLER: I didn’t know where she was or anything. I didn’t care. When you
were on that farm, you just lived.

STEIN: Can you describe the life on the farm a little bit because now fewer and
fewer people actually are living on family farms.

GABLER: Well, Grandpa would get up probably 4:30 and fix the fires and go out to
do chores. Grandma would get up, and I think she went out and helped milk. She
always helped milk. They were milking by hand. Then they’d come back and have
breakfast. Grandpa would go out and do whatever had to be done. In the winter
time he -- I don’t know what he did, fixed the tools that needed fixing, or
what. Grandma always had housework and canning and washing clothes and whatever.
Out in the woodshed, oh, yeah, we could always stack wood when Grandpa split it,
things like that. She had the old fashioned wooden washing machine that you
pushed something back and forth, back and forth and do the wash. She’d hang
them on the line.

STEIN: That’s hard work.

GABLER: Well, it probably was.

STEIN: Somebody strong.

GABLER: Yeah, it probably was.

STEIN: I can’t imagine what the winters must have been like.

GABLER: I can’t imagine them either because now these kids go by here in the
dark either in the morning or at night to go to school, and sometimes it’s
morning and night they’re walking in the dark. We had usually a mile and a
half to walk in the country. I can never remember at all walking in the dark.

STEIN: Really.

GABLER: Well, you had to go to school, at least start at 8:00 to get there, a
mile and a half. Usually at this country school when we were with the
grandparents, the teacher lived somewhere along that line and would walk the
last bit --

STEIN: What was school like, especially since you have these experiences of
pretty different schools?

GABLER: Well, it was always -- a couple of times I was in the town school,
didn’t like that at all.

STEIN: Why not?

GABLER: Well, the first school I can remember being in town, I was probably in
the third grade, a communal toilet. I wet my pants once rather than to go to the
bathroom where other girls could see me.

STEIN: Oh, there were no walls?

GABLER: Well, there was walls, evidently, but no -- I don’t know if it was
walls, there wasn’t any door. Separate ones. Oh, man. I must have been very
shy. I did outgrow that. But the teacher in the first grade, would be up there
learning to read, and maybe when they get back, the second grade go up and do
the same thing. Some of the older kids might be assigned to help these younger
ones. That was a good atmosphere in the schools to have all eight grades.

STEIN: In one room, at the same time?

GABLER: Yeah, I don’t think they invented kindergarten. Well, they might have
had it in city schools. I don’t think they invented it until my brother three
years younger, I think he didn’t have to go to kindergarten either. They would
start out in first grade. So it was nice.

STEIN: The country, were they all one-room schoolhouses with all the grades together?

GABLER: The country schools were.

STEIN: How about the town school?

GABLER: In the third or fourth grade we was in a school in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, that had two rooms, so it was up, I think, about fourth grade in one
room and fourth to eighth in the other. So it was still mixed grades. I don’t
think I was ever in a school that had one room each until after I started high school.

STEIN: Do you remember, did you have to buy your own books and bring all your
own supplies, or did they have that at the school?

GABLER: Michigan never anything like that. You could always buy used stuff from
somebody else, but back then they kept the books so long it would probably use
the same books, keep them in the family, over and over. I don’t know how old I
was before they got these paper books that you do your spelling in the book, you
do your arithmetic in the book, you throw it away. Back in those days you had a book.

STEIN: And you kept it.

GABLER: Yeah, and if you didn’t need it, you could sell it to somebody else in
the same school.

STEIN: At the country school, do you know how far people came from? Were there
some kids who were walking --

GABLER: Two miles?

STEIN: Uh huh.

GABLER: Probably. Ours was always about a mile and a half.

STEIN: Because it sounds like it was pretty isolated where, at the farm at
least, there weren’t so many neighbors close by.

GABLER: Well, for a while there was a house maybe a quarter of a mile further
that had several kids that would walk our distance, and then we’d all walk
together. But nobody was driven to school. Everybody walked, including the
teachers, most of the time.

STEIN: Even in the Michigan winters?

GABLER: Yeah, I guess so. Michigan winter, when you’re living it, is just
something that’s there. It’s not an ordeal. The people that live in Michigan
think I’m crazy to live out here. Hardly any of them want to -- well, maybe
for a visit, but definitely don’t want to move out here. My oldest boy is
sixty-six, he don’t want to fly even. He’s offered to come out on his
motorcycle, and I told him I’d rather have him stay in Michigan than come out
here on a motorcycle.

STEIN: Smart idea. Keep him safe. So other than going to school and being on the
farm with your family, were there other activities that you remember doing as a
young girl?

GABLER: I was probably in the seventh grade when I heard about, what was that?
It might have been 4H, so anyway, I walked a mile and a half to the school and
then another half mile or something to this person’s house. I didn’t go very
long. I couldn’t learn crocheting from my mother because she didn’t know how
to do it right, and one teacher taught me how to crochet, and I went home and
showed my mother I could croquet. She says, “Well, that’s just the way I do
it.” Somebody else showed me.

STEIN: Did she make clothes for you?

GABLER: Oh, yeah.

STEIN: Were most of the clothes made at home?

GABLER: I had relatives in Lansing that would bring coats. I hated to see a
winter coat come in the door.

STEIN: Why did you hate that?

GABLER: Because very few alterations, and then I had to wear it.

STEIN: You didn’t want to wear a coat?

GABLER: Well, I didn’t want to wear an old lady’s coat.

STEIN: Ahh.

GABLER: But it was wool, and it was warm, and shorten it or whatever, I wore it.

STEIN: People talk about the Sears catalog or the clothing catalogs being a big event.

GABLER: Oh, yeah, that was a big event when it was new. It was a practical event
when it was old because it always ended up in the out house. [laughs] When I was
in my fifties we had a couple from town out to play cards, and we had sold our
farm and was living in a hay barn that we had converted into a cabin because our
home was a hundred miles away. So we was in this converted hay barn and had an
outdoor toilet again. So this city gal had to go out to the toilet in the middle
of the night, and I suppose she had a flash light. Anyway, she come in thrilled.
She’d found a Sears &amp; Roebuck sales catalog with a certain date on it that she
needed for a treasure hunt. She knew she’d be the only one with a Sears &amp;
Roebuck catalog.

STEIN: And she found it in an outhouse. [laughs]

GABLER: I never heard what kind of mileage she got out of that.

STEIN: Let’s hope something good.

GABLER: It was just funny that it was out there.

STEIN: Yeah. Do you remember sort of improvements like plumbing or flushing
toilets or indoor toilets coming?

GABLER: Well, I think they had a telephone down in West Virginia from my
husband, who was the youngest of fifteen, next to the youngest of fifteen. They
had a telephone before we did. I spoke on a telephone at a fair, and my voice
was so scared. They played it back, I was so scared. I was probably in high
school at that time. When we married her last husband, we moved into a farmhouse
that had a radio, we had never had that before. I was twelve or thirteen, so we
could listen to Grand Ole Opry on Saturday nights. I don’t know about this
same farm he had the well in the kitchen, but it was still a hand pump, you
pumped all your water.

STEIN: But it must have been easier that it was indoors at least.

GABLER: Oh, yeah. You carry it to the stove to heat up the laundry and stuff. It
was a lot handier. But that was the first indoor water we had.

STEIN: That’s sort of a thrill.

GABLER: Well, everything was new and wonderful wherever we went.

STEIN: Did you as a family have a religious upbringing? Did you go to church or --

GABLER: No. My grandfather read the Bible to himself every night before he went
to bed, and that was our only exposure. Well, once in a while in the cities, we
could go to Sunday School, the kids. My mother would see that we went to Sunday
School if it was close by when we were in town. But that was it.

STEIN: I just am curious when you said you were living in the --

GABLER: Three tents?

STEIN: Yeah, was that, how old were you then and where was that?

GABLER: I graduated from there, so I was seventeen.

STEIN: That was when you were just done with high school, and do you remember
was that farm land that you --

GABLER: They bought three acres, and it was the first land that they had bought.
So in the spring as early as possible evidently, they set up the big tents here,
and they had their double bed in there and one or two babies. And cooking and so
on, and then back here, here was a small tent that sloped this way and another
small tent that sloped that way. So my older brothers was in here and me and
some of the younger kids was over here. And it was just fun. Daddy finally built
a house on the hill over here. I think that was after I got a job. First summer
I was babysitting, but then I got a job in Lansing.

STEIN: They were just --

GABLER: Camping out --

STEIN: Until they built the house, is that the idea?

GABLER: He got the basement in before winter. They lived in that, because I came
back from Lansing to visit them in that basement. Then they got the upper on,
but didn’t finish that off. They were sleeping upstairs. And he had to go to
service, so they must have finished it off after he came back. My husband and
him both were in about --  I don’t think more than two years.

STEIN: Was he, this wasn’t your biological father, but it sounds like he was --

GABLER: Well, he adopted us when he went into service. Us older two had unknown
fathers, and he couldn’t adopt his third one because he did have a father, but
my mother went and found this fellow in Grand Rapids and took him to a lawyer,
and he couldn’t read or write. My mother said the lawyer was so patient, over
and over and over explained to this man that he wasn’t signing his life away
or anything. He just had to sign a paper saying he’d never supported that boy.

STEIN: Okay.

GABLER: He finally got him to put an X down.

STEIN: And that was enough so that he could be adopted.

GABLER: Well, he didn’t adopt him. He just wanted -- he had to prove that he
had been supporting him for the last several years. So then she got him on the
-- oh, man, that was the most money coming in when all those, let’s see, six,
seven kids, no, five kids, six kids was on, probably seven. My oldest brother
was still home, but he was working on a farm. I was away. She probably had seven
dependents when he went into service. That was a big paycheck. She sold this and
bought a eighty-acre farm while he was in, the two years he was in service.

STEIN: How big was that first farm that she sold?

GABLER: Three acres.

STEIN: She sold three acres and got eighty.

GABLER: Yeah.

STEIN: That’s amazing.

GABLER: Yeah, it was on time, but it still was awful cheap.

STEIN: Yeah, and was that because his pay, your father’s pay, was based on how
many dependents he was supporting?

GABLER: Sure.

STEIN: Okay, because that’s so different from today where you just get a
paycheck based on the job and they don’t really --

GABLER: Well, I don’t know. I imagine in service you get paid by the
dependents, yeah, I wouldn’t’ know. Most of these young people going now
probably don’t have any dependents, but still I bet that’s the way it works.

STEIN: So were you adopted by him officially?

GABLER: Yeah.

STEIN: Because your father was --

GABLER: Unknown.

STEIN: Unknown, okay.

GABLER: The fact that we knew him had nothing to do with it. None of them ever
did any contributing to the upbringing of the kids.

STEIN: What was your father, your adopted father like? Were you close to him?

GABLER: Oh, after he got older I was. I was totally indifferent for years, but
when he ended up in the Veterans Hospital and no place to go, I’m glad it was
my husband that invited him to come live with us. So he lived with us for --
well, he needed help with a bandage on his stomach, so I’m changing the
bandage. My mother kicked him out, they got a divorce finally in their
seventies. Anyway, yeah, we were close in those later years.

STEIN: So a lot of this time is right in the midst of the Depression.

GABLER: No, I think they began to get out of the Depression.

STEIN: When the war started I guess.

GABLER: Before that.

STEIN: Do you remember any of the New Deal programs or anything about FDR?

GABLER: Oh, well. I don’t know who was President when they got the -- was it
FDR that got the WPA going? Because my dad, he was not too successful on this
farm up north, but he got a job surveying those -- what they call the slashings,
all them woods around up north in Michigan. He would be out there, and he got a
car because of that, I guess.

STEIN: And that was a WPA project.

GABLER: Um hmm. Nobody before had ever cared what was out there that I know of.
So that was probably just a paid job, but it was good while it lasted.

STEIN: Yeah, and do you remember hearing your parents talk about the President
or about the Depression or these programs, or are they just happy to have that job?

GABLER: At the time we lived here today, gone tomorrow. We never planned
anything. I’m sure they planned to load up and move back down to Hastings area
where my grandparents lived. When he got down there, he got a job in a factory
for the first time. After that it was just more or less like it’s going to be
for the rest of their lives, not so much moving.

STEIN: Okay, more stationary at that point.

GABLER: I was gone by then. It did help me decide that I was going to have all
of my children by one man, which I did. I had four Eye boys.

STEIN: So these are the pictures from your high school graduation. Did you go to
just one high school, or did you move around then, too?

GABLER: Went to ninth grade in Mancelona, Michigan, and the beginning of the
tenth we moved to Hastings or Freeport, so I went the rest of the tenth grade
and all of the eleventh. That was one of the years I stayed in one school at
Freeport. If I go back there now, I’d go to the Freeport reunion, even though
I didn’t graduate from Freeport.

STEIN: Because that was the longest stretch.

GABLER: Well, yeah, because I was born in Freeport, and that was the place I
went back to every time we went back to Grandma and Grandpa. I knew the people
around on the farms and in that city. I probably don’t know any of them now.
But Hastings, we went there for the last year, and I graduated from Hastings.
And that’s where my two boys live now. Two of them are gone.

STEIN: Do you remember what types of classes you like in high school or whether
the outside of school stuff that you were most interested in? What were your
memories of that time?

GABLER: We always lived out of town. I don’t remember participating in
anything to do with school.

STEIN: No dances?

GABLER: Oh, heavens no.

STEIN: Why not?

GABLER: Well, it didn’t occur to me for one probably. Twelfth year I had a big
sister in the school, and I met her once.

STEIN: Someone you were with or --

GABLER: Yeah, she was supposed to answer any questions or help me in any way. I
only got lost once and had to go to the office to see where the chemistry room was.

STEIN: Was it a big building?

GABLER: Well, Freeport had all twelve grades in a, I don’t know how they did
it now, but it was a square building, the upstairs was the junior high and high
school. We probably had two rooms. I can remember there was a typing room. The
downstairs was grade school, so if there was any school activities in that
place, I never heard of them. If there was any in Hastings, I didn’t hear of
them either because I wasn’t interested. I knew one girl in the ninth grade,
and she was my friend, and that’s all I needed. If we wanted to walk downtown,
we could, or walk over to her place; she lived in town. I just didn’t need
anybody else. So consequently when I was in line -- my name was Rohrbacher --
the guy ahead of me was Reed, and he looked down at me and he says, “Well, I
didn’t know you was a senior.” Neither did anybody else because --

STEIN: Was this at graduation?

GABLER: Yeah, this was at graduation. I didn’t know any of the seniors. But
because I started Latin up in Mancelona -- Freeport didn’t offer it -- I was
taking tenth grade Latin, tenth grade Geometry. I don’t know, I was probably
in twelfth grade English, but you couldn’t tell by that, and whatever else I
had. I was on a college course, so I had to make up the Latin and the Math. So
that’s how come nobody knew I was a senior.

STEIN: Oh, because you were taking different classes.

GABLER: Lower classes, yeah. Make-up classes really.

STEIN: Because you had kept switching schools?

GABLER: Well, because Freeport, I was in most of the tenth and all of the
eleventh, didn’t offer that stuff.

STEIN: Right.

GABLER: Latin, especially.

STEIN: Were those some of your favorite classes?

GABLER: Oh, favorite classes always had something to do with reading. Chemistry
was pretty good because the boys knew that they could get the professor there to
talk about Ford motor cars or buttermilk biscuits, and as soon as they got him
on that subject everybody else could do whatever they pleased. I always had a
book to read inside of my Chemistry books because I didn’t know when he was
going to get off onto those subjects. Yeah, that was pretty good, anything to do
with reading, and I still like reading the best.

STEIN: So you weren’t going to dances. Was there a lot of dating in high
school or did you have a boyfriend?

GABLER: If there was, I didn’t know anything about it. I went through there in
a reading frenzy, probably. You never had enough to read before, my mother one
year signed up for true love stories. I read every word in those magazines when
they come. You just don’t realize, nothing to read? My grandparents told me,
and my mother, too, I guess, that I learned to read behind the kitchen stove
because she had wallpapered, behind the stove she’d wallpapered with
newspapers. I don’t know how much of it I could read, but I that’s how I
learned to read they said.

STEIN: Wow.

GABLER: Grandpa got the paper, but I don’t remember ever reading it except the
funnies. But I was a lot younger then. By the time I got old enough to really
enjoy reading, I wasn’t around him so much any more.

STEIN: Do you remember where you were when you heard about Pearl Harbor?

GABLER: Well, Pearl Harbor, that’s so long ago.

STEIN: That’s right.

GABLER: I don’t remember hearing that exactly. All of a sudden there was talk
of war, but I was working in Lansing at the TB Sanitarium with my best
girlfriend from high school. And I don’t know how long the war had been going
on when we heard that the Willow Run was hiring, so we went in to tell the head
doctor of this sanitarium that we was going down there and look for work. He
says, “Well, you know, I could freeze you right here,” but he didn’t. He
could have made us stay because it was a hospital type place, necessary.

STEIN: And freezing means that --

GABLER: Yeah, we couldn’t move.

STEIN: Because it was necessary for the war effort?

GABLER: Well, yeah, that was. But evidently the Willow Run bomber plant needed
help so bad --

STEIN: Yeah.

GABLER: They were recruiting down south and men and boys and even their families
were coming up to Michigan, and, of course, whole families come, too. I don’t
know how long it took them to build those -- they had these big, long,
two-stories high dormitories for women and more for men. I saw some of them here
in California. It was like they opened this up, and it would be two small mobile
homes, and every one of them was two. That was for young married people, so
after we got married, we had one of those for a while. My girlfriend still
stayed in the dormitory. But that was 1943, it got on here, so the war had been
on for a couple of years. It took them a while to build that big bomber plant.
So anyway, we went down there and got the jobs, Rosie the Riveter.

STEIN: Let me take one step back before we get into that, but you said that you
were at the TB Sanitarium. Was that right after high school or what were --

GABLER: It was probably one year, I think the first year after high school I babysat.

STEIN: For your family or friends?

GABLER: No, no, for a couple with two boys. Then this girlfriend got a job at
this TB Sanitarium. She was recruiting two or three other girls from high school
who ended up at that sanitarium, too. But when it come time to go to Willow Run,
just her and I went with this fellow. And his girlfriend, it was, had a car. And
the girlfriend couldn’t get a job because she was seventeen. He was seventeen,
too, but boys could get a job in the bomber plant at seventeen. We were
eighteen. I was nineteen; you had to be eighteen. We were nineteen.

STEIN: Were you excited to get out of the TB sanitarium?

GABLER: Oh, no, that was fun, too. Any work that I ever did, it was fun. My son
once intimated I didn’t have sense enough to know that it was a nasty job or
something, because he always complained about his jobs. He’d go in, it was,
“Oh, wonderful job.” Wouldn’t be there six months, it was time to quit, so
terrible. Mine were always good. We got acquainted with all the people in that
sanitarium. I probably got an inactive TB bug. I was checked once and had a
reaction, and they checked it and said that I had been exposed to TB, but it was
dormant. So it’s always been dormant as far as I know.

STEIN: Yeah, lucky.

GABLER: Yeah, yeah, wasn’t too concerned about it back then. But there was one
area where the nurses wore masks when they went into those few rooms there. I
don’t remember if we did or not. I was a floor girl, and this girlfriend was
the dietician’s helper, so she stayed in the kitchen. But I was out there
getting acquainted with all the patients.

STEIN: Before you were really working completely in the war effort at Willow
Run, do you remember any changes that happened because of the war?

GABLER: Well, they had blackouts in Lansing where this TB Sanitarium was.

STEIN: Were you living in the --

GABLER: We were living at the sanitarium, a big dormitory. The cooks were the --
what do you call them, that look over the young girls?

STEIN: The chaperones?

GABLER: Yeah, they had two, past middle age maybe, cooks, and they were the
chaperones for that dormitory.

STEIN: Were they women?

GABLER: Oh, yeah, it was all women. Then we had a nurses’ dormitory, all
women. If there was any men around that sanitarium it had to have been a couple
of doctors.

STEIN: And the patients were --

GABLER: Mixed, oh yeah, had a floor for the women and a floor for men, then that
little section of intensive TB. That was only about six or seven rooms. They
believed in fresh air.

STEIN: Yeah, did you have to ration there?

GABLER: No, at the TB Sanitarium, I think that was before rationing. I don’t
know how long into the war before they got rationing, but it didn’t affect me
personally. Well, the gas did before the war was over, but the meat didn’t
because when I was working at Willow Run we always ate out. We just had a room;
we never thought about cooking.

STEIN: You would eat at a restaurant every night, or at the cafeteria.

GABLER: Well, this Willow Run living area was probably two miles from the
factory. They had something called the cattle car, which was a truck with a big
enclosed flatbed, where we’d either stand or sit on a side bench. That’s
where you’d meet to go to the bomber plant, or you could walk. There was a
trail that you could walk, and we did that all the time when it was nice
weather. This complex had these dormitories, those little housing for married
couples, a big recreation building that was open twenty-four hours including the
restaurant. So if we worked midnights, we could go there for breakfast and play
games or whatever. If you worked there in the afternoon shift and got off at
midnight you could go and have breakfast and do the same stuff. It just didn’t
matter, it was always open.

STEIN: Wow. So had you heard about the plant before you ended up working there?

GABLER: Barely. That kid got hold of the information that they were hiring
evidently. We knew his girlfriend; we didn’t know him. The only reason we
went, we heard it through them. Got down there; why, here was all these
strangers from other countries, I mean other states. It got to be, “Oh, boy,
here’s somebody from Michigan.”

STEIN: Like a rare local.

GABLER: Yeah.

STEIN: Where were they mostly from?

GABLER: South.

STEIN: Just the deep South?

GABLER: Men coming out of the hills and mountains and so on. The Eye family
already had two or three of these fifteen kids was up here. So they talked --

STEIN: The Eye family?

GABLER: That was their last name, Eye, E Y E. Their mother and father and
youngest brother was still home. Well, Ralph was my husband, and his youngest
brother were still home. They four moved out and bought a place in Inkster, and
my husband and his dad both got a job there.

STEIN: They moved specifically for those jobs.

GABLER: Well, they came up specifically because the jobs were available, and two
or three of the kids was already up here.

STEIN: Okay.

GABLER: I don’t think any of them was working in the bomber plant. But when I
first married my husband we moved in with his folks, who had a two-bedroom
bungalow. That didn’t work out too good. So we got one of those little rental
places here. Then he had to go into service.

STEIN: When did you and your husband get married?

GABLER: When?

STEIN: Um hmm.

GABLER: We got married August 28 in, gee, I forgot the date.

STEIN: Was it --

GABLER: I was nineteen, so twenty-four and nineteen is ’43.

STEIN: ’43. Was that right after you moved there? After you started working at
Willow Run?

GABLER: Well, I don’t know. I was still living in that dormitory, so that’s
before I was married, so that might be ’43. A lot happened in a short time. We
got married in ’43, and my husband went into service in December, and my son
was born in May.

STEIN: Wow, right because here’s a picture of you pregnant in 1944.

GABLER: Yeah. I was an illegitimate child myself, so I was real happy that I was
married nine months and one day when that kid came. [laughs]

STEIN: Oh, wow.

GABLER: I couldn’t wait for that big bump to get off of there.

STEIN: I bet. I’m so curious what this social life was like at Willow Run.

GABLER: Well, we’d get there early and sit around and talk until it was time
to go to work. I run a rivet gun, and I think my girlfriend actually did a
riveting gun where a man bucked. The women did the riveting, and the men reached
their arm in there and held that big hunk of steel against, so the rivet would squash.

STEIN: Okay.

GABLER: Men always did that. Women didn’t.

STEIN: Was it a hard physical job?

GABLER: Well, evidently. It must have built quite a muscle. You’re reaching,
up here the aileron is shaped like this, this side is straight, so the inside
there you go all the way down there and around the bend and come back, it’s
probably about that wide.

STEIN: Wow, so the man’s arm was inside, and the women were doing the riveting
from outside.

GABLER: On the outside, yeah. Every one of them rivets, probably that far apart.
All that aluminum had to be riveted, that bucker had to be back there. I only
filled in for that kind of riveting once, and the rest of the time I ran a
squeeze gun.

STEIN: What’s that?

GABLER: Well, you put this aileron has a part about like this.

STEIN: An aileron, can you explain what that is, too?

GABLER: Where’s that picture?

STEIN: Is it the back of the airplane on the wing?

GABLER: No, this is the wing. There’s the aileron, that thing standing up back
there at the tail end. There was two of them.

STEIN: That piece way end of the tail?

GABLER: Yeah, and I think the aileron part that we worked on, right through here
it swivels, so if that great big plane wants to curve, those two ailerons cause
it to have a little reason for turning in the back.

STEIN: Okay.

GABLER: I don’t think they could turn very rapidly, they’re too big. But
when they wrote that song about coming in on a wing and a prayer, it was either
this one or the B-17. I think the B-17 had four engines, and the B-27, maybe
that was the one with two.

STEIN: The B-24 had four engines, right?

GABLER: Yeah, and I think the B-17 did, too. Right in here in the middle of that
aileron it was a box about like this that you had to rivet in place. It was
solid aluminum so that that’s where they hooked all this gear that did the
turning. To do that you had a squeeze gun about this big, and it had a bit right
about here down at this end. You squeeze the lever --

STEIN: Trigger?

GABLER: And it would squeeze. You put the rivets in all these holes, and then
squeeze, squeeze, squeeze all the way around that. So actually I didn’t have a
bucker. The buck was on the rivet gun.

STEIN: Okay.

GABLER: I told somebody here once years ago that I was Rosie the Riveter, years
ago when I first started coming here, I guess. And she says, “Well, they
called us Rosie the Riveters out here, but in the shipyards it was mostly welding.”

STEIN: Yeah, Wendy the Welder. [laughs]

GABLER: I never heard of that one, but Rosie the Riveter got its name out here.
We sure didn’t -- I didn’t hear about it back there.

STEIN: You didn’t hear about the name or the song or anything?

GABLER: Well, I might have heard the song, but I didn’t realize it was a big
thing out here. It wasn’t a big thing back there. Everybody that practically
-- well, no, I guess not. Not everybody worked there, but so many did. My
husband when I met him -- I met him out here at one of these impromptu
ballgames. The guys would be out there, well, we was walking across, and we saw
these guys playing workup softball. So we got in it because all the guys was
there. We were having a ball, and these other two guys, Ralph said, him and his
brother were out cruising looking for dates. They saw two girls in that
ballgame, so they stopped and played the rest of the game just to get acquainted
with us. That’s how I got acquainted with him. And he worked at the bomber
plant, rivet repair man.

STEIN: So what were his responsibilities?

GABLER: If me or Elaine was the regular rivet gun, if you made a mistake, if the
bucker wasn’t working right -- whatever, it might slip off and make a dent in
that aluminum -- anything that was wrong with a rivet, they called the rivet
repair man. He’d come with his thing of frozen rivets and drill out the hole a
little bigger, or whatever was necessary, put in maybe a frozen rivet if it had
to be bigger.

STEIN: What is a frozen rivet?

GABLER: I don’t know what. They were frozen.

STEIN: Were they literally cold?

GABLER: Frozen.

STEIN: Wow.

GABLER: I guess they’d squeeze better frozen.

STEIN: Oh, maybe because it expands when it gets hot or something like that?

GABLER: I don’t know why. Who cared? [laughs] But I met him here. I would
never have met him in the plant. We walked down there where he worked a time or
two after we got acquainted with him, but by then the war was closing down. They
wanted you to look busy. They weren’t ready to lay anybody off yet. But it was
tapering down, so we’d take a walk. That’s the first time we’d walked over
and seen how big the place was.

STEIN: Oh.

GABLER: Because it was an area where we went a certain way and got to the
ailerons. That’s where we’d wait or goof off or whatever. So when we had all
this time, we walked over to the big areas where the plane was almost done
before it would go outside to be finished. There was a lot of -- well, not a
whole lot, but you could always see some, the dwarfs or little people.

STEIN: Yes?

GABLER: That could get into the tight places for like bucking rivets or
whatever. They were needed.

STEIN: They had dwarfs as buckers?

GABLER: Yeah, it was in the areas where grown men couldn’t get.

STEIN: Wow. Were there a lot of them?

GABLER: Well, I didn’t see, I never worked around any of them, but if you
stood at the gate, doors there waiting to go in or out, the people that were
coming out or going in, there’d be like one or two amongst the crowd. They
were just more of the guys. Like one of them -- they’re smaller -- one of them
would goose the guy just as they went by, wheeling around like this to sock
somebody, the guy knew who it was, but it was good relationships there.

STEIN: Yeah, I imagine that that must have in some ways been a really good job
because I bet it was pretty hard at those times to find work.

GABLER: Well, find work? No, that was the time they were begging people to work.

STEIN: Well, right, but if you were a dwarf, it would probably be harder to find
a good job in a factory, but --

GABLER: Oh, yeah. Oh, sure. That probably was their main break into society.

STEIN: Yeah.

GABLER: They always been treated like circus people before. I don’t know. I
had never given it a thought.

STEIN: Well, it takes, I guess, all kinds of people to put these planes together.

GABLER: Well, I can’t remember; back then Michigan was kind of pure white. I
cannot remember any other nationality.

STEIN: Really, there were no black workers.

GABLER: Not that I can remember, and no other nationalities.

STEIN: Asians, or it was all white?

GABLER: Well, I didn’t know about the Asians in California being rounded up.

STEIN: What did you hear; do you remember when you heard about that? After the
war was over?

GABLER: Oh, yeah. Years and years later. Yeah, it wasn’t anything to do with us.

STEIN: Yeah, you were right in the middle of the country.

GABLER: And the news weren’t -- actually, the people today are told how poor
they are. Oh, boy, you poor, poor suffering people. I’m not sure too many of
them that believe it. Right there where you had your hand out. Back when I grew
up, I just was lucky that we always could go back to Grandma and Grandpa.

STEIN: Right.

GABLER: Always. She’d find some way to get us there.

STEIN: I’m going to change the tape because we’re nearing the end of --
