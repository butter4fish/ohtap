Molly Graham: This begins an oral history interview with Patricia Graham. The date is April
27th, 2015. The interview is taking place in Bushkill, Pennsylvania, and the interviewer is Molly
Graham. Could you tell me when and where you were born?
Patricia Graham: Okay, where I was born, [I was] born in Saluda, S-A-L-U-D-A, South
Carolina, March 9th, 1949.
MG: Was your family from Saluda?
PG: Yes, my father was born there. My mother was born in Brooklyn, Georgia and grew up,
[was] raised in Saluda also.
MG: What do you know about your family's history, starting on your father's side?
PG: My family, we know a little bit about our history, because on my father's side we have
family reunions every five or six years. We know that there was a plantation, a grand plantation,
there, and obviously my father's family came from the plantation. We traced our routes back to
my grandmother's father basically. That's my great grandfather, and he eventually migrated to
Chicago during I guess it was part of the industrial revolution. My father was in World War II.
After the war, he married and married my mother. When I was three years old, they decided,
because farming was going down, they decided we were going to move to a city, and we moved
to Philadelphia. I attended elementary and middle school in Philadelphia and then later high
school and college in New Jersey.
MG: What about the family history on your mother's side?
PG: I know a little less because when I was born both grandparents were deceased on my
mother's side. They're buried in Saluda. I know where they're buried and where the family
church was. We were told that my maternal grandfather, his parents came from Haiti, and we
know that his mother was from Haiti. They had a German last name, Wertz, W-E-R-T-Z, as I'm
told, because of the history of Haiti being settled by Americans, Germans, so many people raped
that country, so you could take that part out if you want. [laughter] That's about all I know. I
have lots of cousins on that side of the family, too.
MG: Are a lot of them still in South Carolina?
PG: Yes. Some of my mother's relatives are in South Carolina, in Saluda, and so are my
father's.
MG: What do you know about your father's World War II experience?
PG: I know that he was in the cleanup crew for Pearl Harbor. I know that. I didn't know that
until much later in life, because he didn't talk a lot about his experience. I remember seeing these
pictures of him with Hawaiian girls, because he had this old scrapbook, but I just thought maybe
he was deployed there. He was in the Marines. I didn't know until maybe twenty years ago that
2

he was in Hawaii, because he was part of the cleanup crew for Pearl Harbor. He was stationed in
Oklahoma I know for a while, and I'm not sure where else. I'd like to know more about his
history during the war. I have a photo of him in his uniform as a young man.
MG: Do you know how he met your mother?
PG: It's interesting that you ask me, because I was going to tell you. [laughter] The reason why
both sides of my family are so close, my mother's family, the Wertz, lived out in the country in
Saluda, and my father's family lived in town. My mother, in order to go to school, she had to
come to town and live with an aunt during the weekdays, and her friends, her best friends, were a
family that had sisters. These sisters were my mother's best friends, and these sisters said, "Well,
we have a brother in the service, and when he comes home, I want you to meet my brother." She
met their brother, and then of course that's who she married, her best friend's brother. [laughter]
I think my cousins, the cousins from that side of the family, we're so very close. We're almost
like siblings, because our parents were best friends. Their mother's brother married my mom,
and it's just really very connected that way because it’s a small town.
MG: For the record, what were your parents’ names?
PG: Lillian Wertz. Leo was her middle name, because they thought she was going to be a boy.
[laughter] My father's name was Eddie Roy Graham, and he came from a large family of seven.
My mother came from a family, I think there were twelve kids, because her father married twice
and his second wife had also been married before. People died early, so people remarried a lot I
think because of death. My grandmother brought three or four children to the marriage from her
first marriage, so my mother was the youngest girl and then she had a brother younger than her
in the family.
MG: In what year were your parents married?
PG: 1948.
MG: Can you talk a little bit about what they did for a living?
PG: Yes. My father, on my birth certificate, it says "Father, farmer; mother, housewife."
[laughter] When they moved to Philadelphia, my father got a job, because he was a veteran, he
probably had more opportunities, and he got a job with the company ITT Nesbitt it was called,
and they made air conditioning units. My father drove a forklift. He was a forklift operator for
over thirty-something years with a company in Philadelphia. My mother went to nursing school
in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia School of Nursing, and she became an LPN [licensed practical
nurse]. She was a nurse until she died.
MG: Patricia, are you an only child?
PG: Yeah. [laughter] I'm an only child from my parent's marriage. My father has two other
children. I have a sister, she's older, and a brother who's younger that are my father's children.
3

My parents divorced when I was about thirteen, and so my mother and I moved to New Jersey.
When my father remarried, he was seventy-five, and my stepmother was sixty-five. My father
retired and moved back to our hometown in South Carolina in Saluda. Anyway, at age seventyfive, he remarried and my stepmother was sixty-five. She had like eight children of her own.
[laughter] They were all adults, her children. I have these incredibly large Christmases with my
stepmother, it's wonderful, with all the children and the grands and the great grands.
MG: Can you tell me again why you moved from Saluda to Philadelphia?
PG: When I was three years old, my parents moved to Philadelphia, because farming was on the
decline for small farms. They were a young married couple, and they wanted to establish a
different life. It gave my mother an opportunity to go to nursing school and everything.
Gradually, my father's, all of his siblings moved and my grandmother, except one of my father's
sisters moved to Washington, D.C., but eventually six of his siblings migrated to Philadelphia.
MG: What part of Philadelphia did you move to?
PG: We moved when I was three, we moved to North Philadelphia in a neighborhood [where]
the people were of Swedish ethnicity. There were maybe three black families on the block, and
there were maybe some Jewish people in the neighborhood. You could tell that because the
businesses that were in the ten-mile area were Swedish and Jewish, and I think there were some
Irish people. The elementary school was the same. You could walk to school. The people had
interesting last names, so you learned how to pronounce [laughter] a lot of different names.
MG: Did the black families stick together and the other ethnicities group together, or was it
more of a melting pot?
PG: Well, when I first moved there, that was in the early ‘50s, I don't know that there were as
many black families in black neighborhoods at that time. I think black families were integrating
the neighborhoods. If there were black neighborhoods at that time, I don't know about it. I think
that happened over time, as the white families eventually moved to the suburbs, moved to New
Jersey, or moved to the other small towns outside of the city. No, it was a melting pot in '51- '52,
which was reflected in the schools, at least in the elementary schools. We went to school with a
lot of different ethnic groups, even your teachers were. I remember three black teachers in my
elementary school, a counselor, the gym teacher, and one English teacher. The others were
Italian and Irish. [laughter]
MG: Tell me a little about your early memories from when you moved to Philadelphia.
PG: I remember our house was a corner house on this block, and it's an area in Philadelphia now
that has been relabeled. It's called Brewerytown. I guess there used to be a brewery there. I
remember that I couldn't leave the porch. I had to stay on the porch. There were other little
children that would come across the street, and we’d all play on my porch because my mother
didn't let me leave the porch. [laughter] I remember playing on the porch a lot. One interesting
thing when I was in elementary school, I guess age nine or so, my parents sent me to an away
4

summer camp. I loved to visit other people because growing up as an only child that's the way
you made friends, so visiting was fun. My parents would send me to summer camp here in the
Poconos, which is so ironic to me because later when I got married and moved to the Poconos,
my husband and I were driving around and there was this sign for my camp, Camp (Tekawitha?).
We lived five miles from (Tekawitha?), and that sort of blew my mind. It was still an operating
camp when I moved here in '77. I remember elementary school and always enjoying going away
to camp in the Poconos. I was the only black kid in the camp, in the girls’ camp, and then there
was a connecting boys’ camp. These were camps connected to some church, some religious
[denomination], because they all had a chapel. We always had to go to chapel first before you
did anything else. There was a boys’ camp, and there was one black boy in the camp, in the
boys’ camp. They’d bring us together on weekends, and he was from my elementary school.
His parents sent him on purpose, because I was going to the Poconos and his mom thought that
would be [good for him] because our parents were friends. Joseph [was his name]. On Sadie
Hawkins Day, we had to catch the boys and dress them in our clothes, and so Joseph would
always slow down so I could catch him. [laughter] I guess he thought I’m supposed to catch
him, because he was the black boy from my elementary school. [laughter] We dressed them in
our pajamas, stuff like that. Those are the fun memories.
MG: Did he feel like an ally there?
PG: I guess so, because we didn't see each other every day, only when they brought the boys and
girls together. They say that children are taught racism. I can honestly tell you all those
summers that I went to camp, which was probably about three or four, all I remember is having
fun and playing with other children. Also, another ironic thing is that the camp counselors, we
were told, "Well, they're college students." Lo and behold, they're from, as I learned later,
they're from the local college, which was East Stroudsburg University, which some day, twentysomething years later, I was going to be a professor there. It blows my mind sometimes when I
think about that camp experience and who the camp counselors were.
MG: It sounds like you planted some seeds there.
PG: Yeah, it really does. It's ironic. Life is weird. [laughter]
MG: Were there any experiences of discrimination there from counselors or other campers?
PG: No, I don't ever remember. I remember my parents used to send me for two weeks, and I
even remember what it cost because they would talk about it. It was like sixty dollars a week.
My mother would always buy me a suitcase of new clothes, which my father would complain
about, "Well, why does she need new clothes? They're only kids going to play." I remember the
sixty dollars a week. I don't know why, because I guess it was expensive for them and they
talked about it. I remember one summer, when you had to call you parents. You could talk to
your parents a few days a week on the telephone. I asked my mom if I could stay for the whole
summer, and that would have been like two months. My parents had to physically drive up from
Philadelphia and bring the money, so that they could add more weeks to my stay. I loved it so
much because I was always playing, and at night, I'd go to sleep in a room with other kids. I'd
5

wake up and the kids are still there, and I'm playing all day. That's what I remember, what a
wonderful experience going to summer camp was for me.
MG: What ages were you going to the summer camp?
PG: I must have been like nine, ten, eleven, twelve, elementary school ages. It was elementary
school, not middle school. I didn't go in middle school.
MG: Did your friend from your school go with you all four years or whatever it was?
PG: I think so. [laughter] Yeah, I remember him, yes. I think he did, Joseph. [laughter]
MG: With your mom going to school for nursing, did you have other caretakers or relatives
looking after you?
PG: Yes. My grandmother eventually came from the South. My father's mother lived a pretty
long life. They bought Granny a house in the neighborhood, and then Granny and my father's
younger brother lived with Granny. Granny would take care of me at night or during the day, I
don't know, maybe it was at night, because my father worked at night. His shift was a night
shift, an evening shift. He was home with me during the mornings, and when I’d come home
[for] lunch, Dad was there. I remember he said working night shifts you earn more money, so he
worked the night shift. My mother was in the nursing school during the day, and one aunt, one
of my father's sisters, took care of me. Then, eventually, my father, one of his sisters bought the
neighborhood grocery store from the Swedish family, and there was a house attached to it. It
was just like half a block [away] or something, so I would go there after school also to my aunt's,
to their grocery store.
MG: What stories about growing up did your grandmother tell you?
PG: My grandmother told me that she learned to cook at age twelve. She would stand on a foot
stool at the stove and cook. Her mother died in childbirth, and her father remarried twice, once
in Saluda and then he left Saluda and moved to Chicago. My grandmother would visit him in
Chicago. She was raised by her maternal family; her mother's family raised her. I don't think
she had an easy life. She was a sharecropper, and actually she was not allowed to marry. The
sharecroppers told her if she ever married, then she would lose her home. She had children.
When she became pregnant and had a first child, she wasn't married. That was a story that one
of my uncles used to talk about. That really upset him to hear that Granny was never encouraged
to marry, because she could lose her home and her way of life. She had been raised by her
mother's family, and she had to become an adult pretty quick. I think her seven children she had,
you know, the fathers of the children, they could live with her, it's not a nice story to tell, they
could live with her, but if she ever married, she would lose her home. You can see why her
children, when they became adults, they were eager to move away and start a different life, and
they took care of their mother. They took care of Granny very well. When she moved to Philly,
I think she lived a luxurious life.
6

MG: Maybe talk to me a little bit about your experience at school.
PG: In which?
MG: We can start with grammar school and then go up to middle and high school.
PG: Okay, at grammar school.
MG: Maybe some teachers that stand out to you.
PG: Okay. My guidance counselor stood out, because she was one of the three black teachers in
the school. She was my third grade teacher, and she became the first guidance counselor that the
elementary school ever had. I had to go to her office, because I used to make the letter o look
like a letter a, and they sent me to the guidance counselor because my teacher failed my spelling
test. I remember my mother and father coming up to school saying, "She can spell. I know that
she's a good speller," because they would always test me orally at home and I could spell
anything, but they weren't testing my writing. I’d make the o's look like a's, and I failed the
spelling test. [laughter] They sent me to the counselor to see if I had a problem. [laughter] The
counselor was so nice to me, because she had been my third grade teacher. She made me
practice writing one hundred o's and one hundred a's until I got it right. Still to this day,
sometimes I’m really cautious about it. That teacher who became the counselor always stood
out, because I felt she was very special in helping me because then my grades improved once I
learned how to write better. She eventually became the superintendent of schools in
Philadelphia. On occasion, I would see her at professional conferences in Philadelphia, because
she was a big deal in the Philadelphia school system, like the head person. I have to tell you,
maybe less than five years ago, I was at West Chester University at an event, and there she was,
just looking as beautiful and striking as she was in elementary school. I went over to see her to
say hello. This was the dedication at West Chester University in Pennsylvania. Are you familiar
with our [state university system]? We have in Pennsylvania, the state universities, we have
fourteen, and they're each named after the city in which they're located. West Chester University
is in the Pennsylvania system, and it's located in West Chester, Pennsylvania, which is outside of
Philadelphia, like a suburban area of Philadelphia. It was a dedication of a Frederick Douglass
statue, which I'll tell you later about the Frederick Douglass Institutes in the fourteen state
universities. There was this dedication and an unveiling of the statue. There she was, Mrs.
(Sprigs?), because she lives in that community, and I was so overwhelmed to see her. I learned
that she and I have mutual friends, and I never knew that these people knew her. She always
made a great impact on my life, because my first career out of grad school was a counselor. I
wanted to be a counselor and helping others because of the help that I received. I always
admired her. She was a role model.
MG: Getting into middle and high school, what became your extracurricular interests and
activities?

7

PG: In middle school, I was always acting, and I founded a club. [laughter] We called it
Stagecrafters because we loved to act. I was not a good singer, so they could only tailor some of
the plays that we did that involved no singing. [laughter]
MG: This was John Sartain high school or middle school.
PG: Elementary school was John Sartain. [At Robert] Vaux Junior High in Philadelphia, we
played chess and we learned to speak Russian in middle school, because one of our teachers, the
chess club teacher, had lived in Russia. He was a black teacher, I don't know why he was in
Russia, I don’t really know, [laughter] but to this day, students at that Vaux Middle School, they
have [an] outstanding chess record. They've always had this fabulous chess club. They've
traveled around the world. If you Google them, you'll find out. [laughter]
MG: In high school, were you discovering what subjects you were interested in and what you
were excelling in?
PG: High school, I went in New Jersey, West Side High School. I don't know, I guess I thought
I wanted to be an English teacher, but I was wrong. [laughter]
MG: You said earlier that your parents divorced when you were thirteen.
PG: Yeah.
MG: I am wondering what that was like for you.
PG: Sad, because I never knew that they had any problems. When they had disagreements,
they’d go upstairs to their bedroom and have their disagreement. I never saw them fight or
disagree, so it was like a shock. It was a shock that they were going to separate. That was a
shock, because I didn't think parents separated, at that age, I might have been twelve. They let
me stay on and go to middle school in Philadelphia, because I had started already. I stayed with
my father to finish middle school. They didn't want to disrupt my school friends, which I
appreciate to this day that they did something like that. They made their own separation
agreement. Later in life, of course, I know why they separated and got divorced. They allowed
me to finish middle school before moving to New Jersey. I was able to start high school fresh
with a new class. There was one fun thing about them being separated. Once a month, whoever
I was living with, if I was living with my dad in middle school or my mom in high school, I
would travel on the train once a month [laughter] back to Philly or to New Jersey, wherever. I
never had my own luggage. I used my dad's luggage when I was with my dad or my mom's
luggage, and they always used to make jokes about me wearing out their luggage. I don't know,
it was common sense, they should have bought me my own luggage. Probably today that's why I
have like three sets of luggage. [laughter] So, I never had my own luggage, but I was traveling
once a month. The train ride was always interesting, because I was traveling holidays when
school was out, Easter, summer vacation. The trains were always crowded, because I'm going
back and forth during holiday times a lot. Because I was petite, I was little, I was able to get
away with paying the child's fair, because they never knew that I was twelve. The conductor
8

never knew. I'm traveling by myself at that age. Sometimes, when the trains were very
crowded, when the train arrived in Philly or New Jersey, whichever way I was going, they would
be full. Instead of letting me stand up, people would say, because they had to get me out of the
aisles, some people, it's amazing how nice people were, would say, "Oh, little girl, come squeeze
in here with us." I did that. I sat with other people, or I sat close to someone's seat on my
luggage a lot during those holiday times. I would meet the most fascinating people. I remember
meeting people who were college professors going [to] New Jersey, and they were going home
for Christmas or going back and forth. I met soldiers. I met college students. I often thought
about writing a children's book about riding on the train because of all of the different people and
how people would talk to me. My mother would dress me up like a girlie girl, everything was
perfect, and people would comment on my outfits. People were always very kind when I was
traveling on the train like that once a month, so I always loved to travel.
MG: How did your mother come to settle in the Newark area?
PG: One of her sisters was living there, one sister in Brooklyn and one in East Orange, New
Jersey, so that's how she came to settle there.
MG: I am curious how life was different for you when you moved to New Jersey.
PG: I was in high school, and I had fewer cousins, maybe one cousin in my age group to play
with. He was a boy. He spent time with me because he was forced to, [laughter] so he acted like
a big brother. I had fewer cousins, so sometimes it was very lonely until I learned to make
friends in high school. I played piano most of my life, so I joined the band and they made me
play the clarinet. That was an activity. Because I had to come home for a few hours and be
alone before my mother came home from the hospital, I think she talked to my guidance
counselor and for some reason they got me this little [job]. I was a helper, a teacher's helper, and
the teacher had me typing labels. I learned how to type in Philadelphia in middle school.
Typing, no matter what your major was, typing was something we learned. This one teacher, I
believe he was a science teacher or something, he was always putting labels on the experiments
and things. I would have to stay after school for like an hour or so, closer to the time that my
mother would be coming home, and I'm in this science lab typing labels. Of course, I didn't
know until later that this is why I was picked. It was like they made me think that, "Oh, you
know how to type, Patricia. We need help." [laughter] But it was all my mother's doing.
[laughter] That was what high school was like. High school was mostly Italian. It was like
ninety percent Italian children and some blacks, some Asians. The Asians were Japanese. Yeah,
they were Japanese. I was involved in some of the plays. The one thing that I liked about our
high school, whenever you were in a play, it wasn't a segregated kind of play. If someone was
the mother or the father or the children, they could have been any ethnic group or race. They
didn't discriminate that way, which was a good experience for us as young people. I learned how
to cook from my Italian friends Italian dishes, so I love Italian food. That was a good cultural
experience, too.
MG: You were in high school when the world was starting to change quite a bit.
9

PG: [Yes]. I graduated in '66, yeah.
MG: It was the beginning of the civil rights movement and all the protests. I am wondering if
you witnessed any of the protests or participated in the civil rights movement at all.
PG: Well, I was too young to participate in the civil rights movement during that time. When
President Kennedy was assassinated and Martin Luther King, those were sad times. I remember
sitting in my classrooms and the teachers announcing "President Kennedy is [dead]." We all felt
like a family member, that we lost someone, and Martin Luther King, we lost someone. It was
later in college that I was more exposed to Malcolm X and that movement and had the
opportunity to study and learn more about the movements, and it affected us as college students.
Now, I started at a community college before transferring to Rutgers. At the community college,
we had some black history courses, and we were involved in social movements about relevant
courses at Rutgers also during that time. Rutgers, when I was there, Rutgers College was all
male and Douglass was female and Livingston was the coed campus. We were marching for
what they called relevant courses. We wanted to learn about our own culture and ethnicity. We
wanted courses that addressed issues like that, and we were not high on joining fraternities and
sororities. We tended to see that as very silly kind of behavior back then. In my hometown in
East Orange, I was involved with mayoral elections. They would have the college students from
your community, we would canvas the neighborhoods and pass out leaflets and sign people up to
vote. Because of the period, during the civil rights period and right after that period, I think
young people, college students, we became very civic-minded. We were interested in
volunteering and helping people. During that time that I was in my sophomore year I think at
Rutgers or junior year, Maria Shriver's father developed, not the Peace Corps, VISTA. Have you
heard of VISTA? [Editor’s Note: During the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson, Sargent Shriver
served as director of the Office of Economic Opportunity and initiated many programs as part of
the administration’s War on Poverty. One such program was the Volunteers in Service to
America (VISTA), which was established in 1965 as a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps.
It is now called AmeriCorps VISTA.] Maria Shriver's father, Sargent Shriver, developed what he
called the Community VISTAS, and you would be assigned to working in a community. I was a
Rutgers student. In order to be a VISTA, you had to get like twenty signatures of the legislators
in your community. People had to vouch that you were a good kid and that you were a decent
person. I knew politicians because I had done all this volunteering and stuff. About five or six
of us, we had been students at Essex County Community College. Then, we went on to other
colleges. Some of us went to Rutgers, some went to Newark State, that's now called something
else [Kean University], and other colleges, Williams College in Massachusetts. During that, we
were all still friends, and so about ten of us became VISTA volunteers. We had to go away and
live in New York for a week or two and get our training with the young people that were going
to become Peace Corps, only they were going to work in foreign countries and we were going to
be assigned to nearby communities. A Community VISTA meant that you were a college
student, an upperclassman, a junior or a senior, and you were assigned to a neighborhood center.
In my case, and a few of my friends, we were assigned to a program that offered a tutoring
program. It was in Orange, New Jersey. It was for high school dropouts, and we tutored them in
the GED [general equivalency diploma] program. We worked a certain number of hours a week.
In my case, I had to have a car, because I was commuting back from New Brunswick to Orange
10

maybe three days a week to do my VISTA volunteer work. We were paid five thousand dollars
a year, so we were rich. [laughter] That's what we thought. [laughter] We could pay for our own
apartments, and we didn't have to live on campus. [We could] buy our own gas, and your
parents didn't have to send you money. They stopped sending me an allowance, because as a
VISTA, I was earning money while I was a junior and a senior.
MG: It was shaping your outlook on community involvement and things like that.
PG: Absolutely, yes, on the value of being involved and the value of helping people.
MG: Do you want to take a break before we talk more about Livingston and college?
PG: Okay, yeah.
[RECORDING PAUSED]
MG: It is interesting to hear about that work you were doing with the VISTA volunteers. I am
curious how it brought you from the community college you were attending to Livingston.
PG: Well, I was a VISTA volunteer. My first year I was at Livingston, [I was] a junior. It's just
that the connections that I made at the community college remain with me for life, the professors
and the friends. One of the college professors from Essex County Community recommended me
for the VISTA program, as soon as Sargent Shriver decided New Jersey's going to have the
VISTAs. Does that answer your question?
MG: You had also received a scholarship. Was it to go to the community college and to
Livingston?
PG: I was only enrolled at the community college one year, and then I transferred to Rutgers in
Newark, which I hated. I didn't like it. It was cold and impersonal back then. It's probably a lot
nicer now. My one year at Essex, I received, they had Martin Luther King scholarships, so I
received a Martin Luther King Scholarship maybe one semester. That was the only time I was
on the dean's list at community college. [laughter] Yeah, that's when I received that scholarship.
MG: What did you know about Livingston before you went there?
PG: I'll tell you, I knew it was Rutgers. I would always come back to the community college
every summer to take summer courses because then I could have a work-study job at the
community college, so I was always in touch with my professors. When I transferred to Rutgers
in Newark, one of the professors, who just died a few months ago, Dr. Clem Price, you've heard
of him, so he was a professor of ours at Essex, and at Rutgers-Newark I would go to him for
advice because I was not happy at Rutgers in Newark. [Editor’s Note: In 1969, Dr. Clement A.
Price (1945-2014) began teaching history at Rutgers-Newark, and in 2002, he became a Board of
Governors Distinguished Service Professor.] The classes were so large, and it felt very
impersonal, after coming from Essex for a year and a summer, which was a very warm
11

environment and everybody made you feel like they were on your side. I talked to Dr. Price
often, and he said, "Well, Patricia, I suggest maybe why don't you transfer to this brand new
campus, Livingston? Rutgers has a new campus, and it's co-ed. Maybe you'll enjoy it." Lo and
behold, I went there, and I loved it. Whenever I'd see Dr. Price, I'd always thank him for
advising me to go to Livingston. All I knew was that I had heard, "Well, it's an experiment." It
was labeled as a social experiment. They're bringing together famous artists and writers, and
they're going to be the professors. They're going to have all these cultural events tied to the
academics and new courses, a few black history courses, women's studies courses, courses about
your community, environment and health care and things like that. I was excited to go there. I
had a car, so my parents made me commute from East Orange, because they weren't ready for
me to go away and live on campus. I maintained my good grades, and then they said, "Okay,
you can live on campus." [laughter]
MG: What do you think about that term “experiment?”
PG: Well, the term experiment to me meant they were experimenting with the basic education
and the lifestyle that the students would receive. They had coed dorms. Who had co-ed dorms
in 1970? Not only were they coed dorms, the guys lived on one side of the hall and the girls
were on the other side and we had a kitchen that we could share, which we did on weekends, we
shared. I thought that was an experiment, the lifestyle, the living. Every student had a
counselor, not only an academic advisor from your major, you also had a counselor, which was
wonderful, like someone was guiding you socially and emotionally, and you had an academic
advisor. I saw those things as an experimental way of educating students. The student union
was the hub of the campus, like a community center, and because it was a small campus, you got
to know all of the students. You got to know people from different ethnicities and interact with
people. There were different dormitories. Latino students had a dorm, all of the Latino students,
and they would have cultural activities and programs. The level of speakers, scholars and
musicians that they would bring to that campus, we would have paid big money to go to New
York to see. That’s what I thought was meant by experiment, the whole cultural, educational
environment. I didn't see it as negative. I saw it as an exciting thing. Douglass College was still
all girls. Rutgers was all men. We would dress up and wear dresses if we wanted to go to dinner
at Douglass Campus, because you had to sit in a dining room with tablecloths. When we went to
have dinner, sometimes we'd go to Rutgers College with the men, and we'd wear tight jeans
because we're going to see the men. It was all men, [laughter] so we dressed sexy. I shouldn't
say that on tape, but we did. Livingston Campus was, "Oh, well, you can wear your jeans." It
was very relaxed. The other kids from the other campuses would like to come, they would come
to our campus and have dinner with us, too. It was an interesting time.
MG: You mentioned the speakers that would come to campus. Do any come to mind, or any
that stand out to you?
PG: [Editor’s Note: Dr. Graham makes the noise, “Whoo.”] Oh, my gosh, there were some that
I didn't even know how significant they were until later I became an adult. Let's see, I remember
some jazz pianist. Oh, I can't remember. Jazz pianists, they might have been in the early phases
of their career. Then, they became giant recording artists, that level of jazz. I remember Charlie
12

Mingus, I think he played the bass and piano, who came to our campus, and a political figure,
when they were younger, the Muslim leader who's very ill right now, [Louis Farrakhan]. He was
on his way to becoming a spokesperson for the black Muslims, and I remember him. He was a
very young man, and he came to speak. I remember Vertamae Grosvenor. Before she became a
professor, she came to speak, and she had her cookbook. We learned a lot from her. Then, there
were painters and artists, I can't remember many of the names, I'm sorry, but these were people
that were on the cutting edge of whatever their artistic area was. [Editor’s Note: Vertamae
Smart-Grosvenor (1937-2016) was a chef, writer and actress who was born in South Carolina,
grew up in Philadelphia, and moved to Paris by herself at age nineteen. In 1970, Grosvenor
wrote the autobiographical cookbook Vibration Cooking, or The Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl,
in which she explores Gullah cooking and culture. For three decades, Grosvenor appeared as a
commentator on National Public Radio.]
MG: How would you describe the student body of Livingston during the time that you went?
PG: Culturally diverse, very racially and culturally diverse. From all that I remember, students
got along very well. I remember many of the activities were driven by some themes, like
Women's History Month. We had the big conference, probably the first women's history
conference, I think, on any of the Rutgers campuses back then, and people from other colleges
came to attend. When we celebrated black history, there were always wonderful programs and
speakers, and Latino History Month, in the fall. I think there was a big emphasis on ethnicity
and cultural events, and that was part of educating us about different cultures. I think you got
that, educating us about different cultures, was done in many forms, in the classroom and in the
programming that was done through the student activities and then the professors that you had.
MG: Yes, I was going to ask about your professors. It seemed like a lot of them were leaders in
the Black Arts movement, and that seems to have influenced you.
PG: Oh, my goodness, yeah. Well, those were just my favorite classes that I wrote about, but
my major was urban studies. It was a brand new major at that time. Urban planning was a more
technical major, so the urban studies and urban planning was in the same department. We had to
take some of those technical courses that the urban planners had to take, which I was not happy
about, so I was always getting tutoring from the professors. There was no such thing as a
tutoring program. You either did it or you didn't know how to do it or you got help from your
professors. I had another interesting class that was taught by an attorney, a lawyer, and it had to
do with community issues. He focused on urban community [affairs]. This was a practicing
attorney from New Jersey, and he was Latino, I believe. I wanted my research paper to be
something significant, because I wanted to get an A. I asked a family friend, who was an
attorney, "What's a good issue to do?" because it had to be active research. He said, "Well, you
know, right now [Ted] Kennedy is concerned about health care.” This was in 1971, and
Kennedy, he was a young man. “He's trying to get health care for all Americans, so maybe you
ought to do something on health care." He said that's a good legal issue. I thought, “Well, this
professor is a lawyer. I need to get an A, so I'm going to do something about community and the
law.” I approached the professor, and I said, "I'm concerned about health care for Americans,
and I want my active research to reflect around health care." He said, "Well, okay, I'm going to
13

help you design your project, and what you have to do is go to an urban area. He said, "Well,
you have a car. You can drive to Newark and also go here in New Brunswick. You have to go
to emergency rooms and sit so many hours and observe the people that are coming into the
emergency rooms," because what he was trying to show me, emergency rooms, that was
somebody's primary doctor. They didn't have family doctors. People would come to the
emergency rooms for a headache, a broken finger. It just wasn't some catastrophe where they
were driven in with an ambulance. They’d walk in, because they have blurred vision or because
"somebody hit me in the eye" or something that someone with health care would go to a family
doctor to see. It was the most eye-opening experience to go to an emergency room in Newark. I
think I might have also gone to the hospital where my mother worked [laughter] in New Jersey
in Newark and sat in the emergency room for several hours, and I went to one in New
Brunswick. You saw people, many poor people, coming to the emergency room for routine
kinds of things, and that was a really good active research project. We had to give an oral
presentation and write a paper, and that was probably one of the most challenging courses that I
had I think, stimulating and challenging, to actively go out and observe people.
MG: How did you do on that assignment?
PG: Oh, I got an A. [laughter]
MG: Can you talk a little bit about your impressions of Sonia Sanchez and her classes?
PG: Oh, I'd love to. She was very motherly, and she was your friend and your teacher and a
mentor. She was a fantastic professor. We always felt that we were learning. Her course was
probably the first women's studies course I’d ever taken, and it just opened my eyes. This one
course, “The Black Woman, Part One” and “The Black Woman, Part Two,” we all wanted to
take that course. She held the course, I believe, it was in a dorm apartment or something,
because there was a kitchen actually in the room. She would bring speakers to class, and they
would cook for us, like Vertamae Grosvenor. She brought her to class, before I think she
became a professor eventually there. Vertamae cooked something, and we all bought Vertamae's
cookbook and got autographs. I still have it upstairs in my study. Sonia was a young mother.
She had twins, twin boys, and she used to tell the twin boys bedtime stories. One day, she
decided, she said, "I'm going to write this into a book," so that the children would always have it.
We all bought her book, oh, we bought books, she autographed the books. I still have those
upstairs. I admired her because she was a writer. She knew how to take her life experiences and
make them forever experiences for other people, and as a professor, she always made you feel
that you were learning. In the women's studies course, you were learning about great women,
and then in her writing courses, you were learning to write. She would bring in poets. We
would act out plays, and sometimes the playwright was present. She’d bring the playwright. We
just read a play, and now we're going to act it out in front of the person. That was like mindblowing. Once you graduated, if you wanted to keep in touch with her, you could. I kept in
touch with her over the years. She was just a most fascinating person. I learned so much.
[Editor’s Note: Poet, playwright and activist Sonia Sanchez wrote several children’s books,
including It’s a New Day: Poems for Young Brothas and Sistuhs (1971) and The Adventures of
Fathead, Squarehead and Smallhead (1973).]
14

MG: You took a “Black Revolutionary Drama” class with her, too.
PG: Yes.
MG: What was that like?
PG: Well, that was the course that you were learning to write and to critique plays. [In]
“Revolutionary Drama,” we were reading plays by maybe LeRoi Jones, before he became, well,
he had become Amiri Baraka by then. Do you know that he just passed? We were reading plays
and learning about theater that some people would have said, "Well, this is not traditional
theater," because they wouldn’t classify this kind of creativity. It was exciting theater to me at
that time. We would go into New York to see theater [at the National Black Theatre in Harlem].
I'm trying to think of the one; I can't remember the name. Well, the [New] Freedom Theatre in
Philadelphia is an equivalent to the one I can't remember from New York. That class was very
exciting, because it was reading poetry and theater, and also meeting the artists was very
exciting.
MG: Yes, you mentioned Ed Bullins came to one of your classes.
PG: Yes, oh, my gosh, Ed Bullins. The one play I remember that I always liked was In the Wine
Time. I think it was about an alcoholic. [laughter] To see it performed was really exciting. He
wrote some short plays, and we loved his plays. He's the one that stands out, but there were
other playwrights that came to class.
MG: He was a part of the Black Nationalism movement and a member of the Black Panthers,
and I was curious if they had any presence on campus while you attended.
PG: The Black Panthers had a presence when I was at Essex County College. They had a big
presence, because they came to organize students in getting involved in community activities.
The Black Panthers to me, although they were a revolutionary kind of group, they did
community outreach. When I was a student, I believe, at Rutgers, but the connection for me to
attend this Black Panther conference came through a professor from Essex County College
because he lived in my family's neighborhood, the Black Panthers hosted a conference in New
Haven, Connecticut. They hosted a conference at Yale. This is going to sound incredible.
You’re going to say, “What? How did they do that?” [There was] this conference, and college
students from the East Coast, from the West Coast came to Yale University. It was a weekend
conference. It was a how-to-become-a-community-organizer kind of a conference that the Black
Panthers hosted. I think it was 1970, and they housed us. The students at Yale, because you
know it was men, all men at that time, all of these students, mostly white male students at Yale in
the '70s, there were a few blacks there of course, gave up their dorm rooms. It was very
organized. Their dorm rooms were like two-room apartments, because they had a bedroom and a
living room. Now, at Rutgers, we didn't have a dorm like that. We had nice dorms, but [not like
Yale’s]. You checked in for the conference on a Friday, and you were assigned to someone's
room. Whoever the two students [were that] gave up their rooms, you met them, and they
introduced themselves to us. They assigned four of us to a room by gender. Four girls shared a
15

room, because it was like an apartment but it was a dorm room. The guys met us and introduced
themselves, and they showed us around their little apartment, their dorm room. One guy had this
greatest music collection. He said, I'll never forget, he said, "This is my music collection, and
feel free to play my albums." Laura Nyro, do you know that singer? You’ve got to listen to
Laura Nyro. He said, "This is my favorite album. Feel free to play it, but be very careful." That
was when I was introduced to Laura Nyro, that weekend at Yale University. I had never heard
her before. Later on, Laura Nyro and Patti LaBelle made a CD together. Then, they left us until
time to check out and the guys came back to their room to make sure we left everything in order,
and we did. That conference was an exciting thing to meet college students from various states,
a weekend of workshops led by members of the Black Panthers, and our college professors came
with us to this conference. The focus was how to become a community leader, find out what the
needs are of the people in your community and get involved. Volunteerism was sort of the
theme, and that was like an exciting thing. We had a bus. I think the bus emanated from Essex
County College. I was a student at Livingston, but I was able to go with this group to New
Haven for the weekend for that awesome conference.
MG: That sounds incredible.
PG: It was.
MG: I am always impressed by the large-scale mobilization that took place without all the
methods of communication we have now. It seems like people could really gather together
without cell phones and computers and text messaging. I love hearing about how that happened.
PG: Yeah, it was oral, like what you're doing, the oral history. Someone would make a flyer and
let you know, "Oh, there's a meeting on this or that," so we paid attention. Now, when you go on
a college campus and you see a billboard full of posters, nobody reads them. [laughter] We did,
because those were our cell phones back then, [laughter] posters and flyers and leaflets that
people would hand you and word of mouth or your professor would write on the blackboard
things that are happening. Our social media was different back then. We read. [laughter]
MG: Was there ever any pushback or opposition to these organizations when you would get
together for a conference?
PG: Maybe when I was at Rutgers. I remember on Rutgers College Campus there were protests
about various things, but I was at Livingston. [laughter] At Essex County College, there were
protests about different things. There was a student organization that was formed called the
People's Council, and we would protest certain things about [them] wanting to raise tuition. It
was really inexpensive. I remember Essex County wanted to move from Newark downtown to
out in the suburbs, and people were saying that the college wasn't designed to be that. Yeah,
there were protests, because there was always some protest about some social movement.
MG: I was wondering when the Black Panthers gathered in New Haven if anyone in New Haven
had an objection to that.
16

PG: You know, that, I don't know, because you would think if Yale University sanctioned it that
the community must have thought, "Okay." The Panthers, at that time, remember, they were in
New Haven, they were established. That was their headquarters, actually, of the Panthers on the
East Coast, that was New Haven, the city of New Haven. They had a breakfast program, where
they would feed the children, give them breakfast, because many of the poor children didn't have
breakfast. They were established as community outreach. What was amazing to me is that Yale
University would have this convergence of all of these college kids from all races coming from
as far away as California up to New Haven and that the college students at Yale would give up
their dorm rooms for a weekend so that we could have a Black Panther conference. I'm sure the
Yale students came to the lectures because I remember every workshop we went to was in some
large hall, where there were hundreds of students in one big room, rooms with stages. It was an
amazing thing.
MG: I want to ask you more about Livingston, but I am also conscious of time. We can save
that for next time.
PG: Okay.
MG: Well, this has given me a lot to go on, and it is really exciting to hear about. I wish I could
travel back in time and be there with you.
PG: Me, too. [laughter]
MG: We would have a good time. We will pick up here next time.
PG: Okay.
MG: We will talk more about your Livingston experience and classes and all those kinds of
things.
PG: Okay.
MG: Thank you so much for all your time and for all the food.
PG: Oh, you’re welcome. Oh, you’re so welcome.
MG: I will go back full of stories and quiche. [laughter]
PG: Yes, because you have to take some home.
MG: Well, thank you so much. I will look forward to next time.
