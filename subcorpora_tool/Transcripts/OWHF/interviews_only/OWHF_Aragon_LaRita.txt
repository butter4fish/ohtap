 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Monday, December 20, 2010, and I   m in Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma, interviewing Major General Rita Aragon. This  interview is being conducted as part of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame Oral History Project. Rita was inducted into the Oklahoma  Women   s Hall of Fame in 2009. Thank you for joining us today.  It   s my pleasure. Thank you very much.  Let us begin by learning more about you. Could you tell us a little bit  about where you grew up and give us some background into your early  life?  Certainly. I was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, but I was raised at Dale, a  little rural community about twenty-five miles east of Oklahoma City,  just off of Interstate-40. My parents built their home by hand, quite  literally. My grandfather was a construction guy and my dad worked at  Tinker Air Force Base. We moved there when I was five years old. We  didn   t have indoor plumbing until I was twelve, and we never had a  telephone in my home until I went away to college, which was very  important to my parents. They got married at seventeen, both of them  extremely bright and talented, articulate, well-read, but not able  financially to go to college, so from the time my sister and I were born,  there was talk about us being ready and prepared to go to college. It was  important. They felt like that was the key to success. Both would   ve  loved to attend college. My dad would   ve loved to have been a doctor,  and my mother wanted to be a nurse, but that just wasn   t in the cards. So  instead they both really have had a complete life of service to the  community, and the family, where we live at Dale.  I went to Dale school. We didn   t have kindergarten, so I started at first  grade and went through twelfth. With virtually the same class of kids I  started the first grade with, I graduated. Thirty whole students in that  5  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  class. My thrust in life really wasn   t academic, it was to play basketball.  Dale is a big girls    basketball site, and being rather short of stature, I had  to do a lot of things that made me a little more competitive. Because we  were very poor, back in those days they didn   t have a lot of the stuff you  could go to, Academy, or to the local sports store and buy. So my  mother took an old pair of converse tennis shoes, sewed some fabric on  the outside of it and my dad melted lead and poured into it to make lead  weights so that I could run in the summer, and I would run and run and  run. So it was important from the very beginning that I learned to take  what strengths I had and accentuate those.  Since I didn   t have height, speed was supposed to be the thing I worked  on. And I did. I would run all summer and into the fall to be prepared for  basketball season. Therefore I got to play on the high school basketball  team, which was a big deal, from my freshman year on. I enjoyed it and  loved it. I really believe that was the basis of looking at what I later talk  about, leadership and how important it is on a team to find your  particular role. That   s my early childhood. I have one sister who is a  year younger than I am. Much higher IQ and much smarter than me, but  she only stayed in college a year and then went to work at Tinker Air  Force Base in computer programming. She is a phenomenal computer  programmer.  When you were going to school, did you have a favorite subject?  Something you gravitated towards?  Well, basketball was the overriding point, but to be truthful, I really  enjoyed 4-H and FHA. I actually was the FFA sweetheart, which is a  strange phenomenon in itself. No, I really didn   t enjoy one subject over  the other. In fact, it   s really kind of strange because I was third in my  class (out of thirty that   s not a really big deal), but really, the only  homework I ever had to take home was accounting. Math was not my  strong suit, so I had to really work at that one. But I enjoyed science. I  really enjoyed English and literature. I was fascinated because I loved to  read. I spent a lot of time wanting to learn to write myself, and being  able to express myself. In high school the overriding and overarching  emphasis was on all those special activities. Basketball, volleyball, 4-H,  FHA, and really, in 4-H was when I really began doing public speaking,  learning to do that, and I picked that up in college. I don   t enjoy debate,  but I do enjoy extemporaneous speaking. I like all of the different types  of speech that I was into. I enjoyed those things.  Well as you were going through school and thinking about life, did you  have any idea of what you wanted to be when you got older?  Actually, I really didn   t. You know, back in those days, when you were  6  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  a girl, if you were going to go to college, you were either going to be a  nurse or a teacher. I didn   t feel like I had a strong enough science  background and didn   t like blood, so teaching seemed to be the natural  navigation. To be truthful, my first year at college I was really going into  looking at being a legal secretary, or a legal stenographer. Thinking of  being an attorney was way beyond my thoughts, I mean, I didn   t even  dream about doing that, but I thought I wanted to be a legal secretary.  Then I found out, back in those days, of course, you didn   t have all the  electronic and digital stuff, so you had to be able to take shorthand. I  figured out real quickly I wasn   t any good at that. So I changed my  major and went into education, and at a small rural school, a lot of times  the high school kids worked with the elementary kids. I enjoyed that,  and I thought,    You know, that might be a really cool gig, to be a  teacher and come back home and teach in the school I grew up in.     We   re going to touch upon that in a second, but going back, you  attended college where?  I began at Evangel University or Evangel College at the time, in  Springfield, Missouri. I had a scholarship to go there my first two years,  and then my heart got broken because I thought for sure I was going to  be a minister   s wife, and that didn   t work. Enjoyed the musical part,  participated in a lot of cross-country choral, sang for the radio, for  evangelical radio. But then I got my heart broken, and I decided,    I   m  going home. I don   t need any more of this,    and came back to Central  State University, Central State College at the time, and finished up there.  Because it   s such a great teacher   s school, it was a natural then to move  into elementary education.  I worked the entire time I was in college, but the senior year I was  appointed as a dorm assistant, a DA. I was responsible for freshmen  women on a floor. I found out very quickly I was not necessarily the role  model type. We had to have girls in bed   well, they had to be in study  hall at eight o   clock, so everybody had to be in at eight, which meant, as  a senior, I had to as well. And then I supervised study hall from eight to  ten, and then at ten, lights out. I   ll never forget my real waking up   now  all my girls loved me, and I loved them, and I would do anything for  them, and we had a great rapport. Met girls from all over the state. But  the dean of women at the time and the dorm house mother took real  exception to the fact that I would bend the rules to let the girls do things  that probably weren   t necessarily in their academic best interests.  I   ll never forget one night the Miss America contest was on, and Miss  Oklahoma was in the finals, and the girls were going,    Oh, let us finish  watching this,    and here it was, eight o   clock and time for study hall,  and I went,    Oh, oh,    and so we did. We watched it. And then we got  7  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  busted. And I got called to the dean of women and she said,    Young  lady, you   ll never amount to anything if you don   t learn some self-discipline  and how to discipline others.    And I was just devastated. Dean  Wilma Armstrong was a force to be reckoned with, but it did teach me a  lot about. You know, it   s great to be a good guy, but it   s also important  that you remember that the rules are the rules are the rules. That was a  challenge. So I graduated from Central State College in 1970 and began  my elementary school career.  What was your first school?  Colbertson Elementary. In the fall of 1970, Oklahoma City schools were  not integrated yet, and so this was an all-black school on Northeast  Thirteenth, in the heart of what could be considered the black  community. My first principal was Moses Miller, who had been an icon  as a high school football coach at Douglass High School. In those days  when coaches got ready to retire from coaching, they put them in  elementary schools to be elementary principals because, of course, we  know that it doesn   t take an awful lot to teach little kids. And so I  walked in to the school (by the way, I had never been around any other  culture other than Native American, and only briefly associated with  that. We had some  non-white  students at Dale, had no black students at  all.) I walked into this all-black school and met Mr. Miller, who was a  very imposing person who never got up from his desk when I walked in.  He hired me sight unseen because they needed teachers badly and it was  a rough school and a rough neighborhood. It was also before we did  promotion based on, you know, for a long time you didn   t promote kids  if they couldn   t pass. Then we went to that whole genre where it was  about socialization, and you promoted kids whether they were prepared  or not. But this was in the era before that.  I was taking fifth and sixth grade split class, but Mr. Miller reached  down and opened the drawer on his desk and he pulled out a rubber  hose, like you use in surgical tubing, and slammed it down on his desk,  and he said,    Young lady, you   re very small. I recommend you use this,  and you use it well or those boys will run over you.    And I went, with  big eyes,    Oh my goodness, what have I gotten into?    Because I had  never struck another human being in my life. I couldn   t imagine  spanking children. Mr. Miller was quite correct in the fact that the big  kids would try to run over me, he was right about that. I had fifth and  sixth graders that were six feet tall. Some big guys who had been  retained were thirteen and fourteen years old. But I learned a huge lesson  that year. Some of the faculty that were there were African American,  and they took me under their wings to teach me the culture, to teach me  how to survive. I had some really, really ornery students, and I had some  really, really wonderful students that responded greatly to having  8  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  someone who cared about what happened to them.  One of my great stories to tell is red light, green light. I   d never heard of  red light, green light. But it was where boys raced up and down the hall,  quite loud and quite vigorously, and of course in those old buildings  everything echoed, and they   d scream,    Red light     and everybody  would stop, and then they   d holler   now this was during school. The  kids would just walk out in the hall and start doing this activity, which  was kind of strange to me because I was from Dale where the only  reason you got out in the hall was if you got a hall pass, and then you  didn   t dare do anything because your parents knew what you did before  you ever got home that day. But I stepped out into the hall one day and  they were doing this, and I was teaching something, I don   t know what,  and the kids kept looking up and looking out the door and looking out  the door, and one of the young men ran by and he hollered an obscenity  as he stopped by my door. I walked out, literally reached up and grabbed  him by the lapels, slammed him against the wall, and I said,    Don   t you  ever use that language around me again, or around my class.    And it was  like the pivotal point. Later I would learn that that   s one of Sun Tzu   s  theory of war, which I   ll talk about later, but it was to take on the  biggest, baddest guy there and make him believe you   re the boss, and I  never had any trouble with any of the kids. I had other white teachers in  the building whose tires were slashed, they had sugar in their gas  tanks   I never had any problems with any of the kids. And so I literally  moved into the neighborhood to acculturate myself, got to go for the first  time to black night clubs, black churches, and really get inside,  understand what made my kids tick. And I really think that was a huge  piece of the success story that I had. I was there for two years before I  got married and moved out of state.  It must   ve been very rewarding for you.  I loved it. I loved the kids, I loved the culture, I loved the neighborhood.  Mr. Miller, who was an icon, as I later came to know (I didn   t know who  he was at the time), was an extremely gracious gentleman who had his  ego a little bruised by being moved to an elementary school. I met some  wonderful friends who are still friends today. Roy Joe Ben Thurston was  our physical fitness teacher, or P.E. teacher, and a big hulky guy who  had played semi-pro ball for the Oklahoma Plainsmen, and had been a  high school athlete at Douglass, and played football in college. He was  married to the tiniest little thing you   ve ever met, a school teacher at  Classen High School, one of the very few black high school teachers in  an upper middle-class white school in Oklahoma City. Flossie, Flossie  Thurston, who went on to become Vice-President at Langston  University. They took me under their wing, gave me my first chance at  eating chitlins, and my last, taught me about pressing hair, and all of  9  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  these different cultural-type settings that I   d never been exposed to. And  today we   re still friends and we still see each other, but they were  wonderful. I spent many nights sleeping on their couch and with their  darling daughter Joy, who is now a school teacher herself.  So you got married and you moved out of state. Where did you go?  Went to Cheyenne, Wyoming. Wow. What a shock there. I married a  young man who was a youth minister, and he was from Wyoming and  had come down to do graduate school at UCO. I was working on my  graduate degree at night at UCO, and kind of one of those fairy tale  things. We both thought we were so old we were never going to get  married. I think we were twenty-four. So we decided,    Mmm, this is the  time, this is the place, and let   s do it.    So got married and moved to  Cheyenne, Wyoming. I couldn   t teach up there, there was no teaching  jobs available, so I worked at the Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance  company and answered the phone. We were there about a year, and we  decided it was time to move back to Oklahoma. And so we did. We  came back to Oklahoma and I reapplied to teach in the Oklahoma City  Public Schools.  Where did you end up?  At Van Buren. It   s kind of scary, because the first two schools I taught  in were closed down, so that might tell us something. Van Buren was in  south Oklahoma City, and again, this was after integration had taken  place, that was at that pivotal point, and they did what they called    open  classroom teaching,    and so all of the walls were taken out of the  building. You had little risers, usually bookshelves that separated the  classrooms, but you literally could see and hear all of the classes in the  building at one time. Chaos, pure chaos. But it was a school strategy at  the time, and we tried it. It certainly kept people honest, because you  knew what they were doing. You could tell what everybody in the  building was doing at all times. And I taught there for three years before  I got a chance to go to the fifth year center. I loved teaching fifth grade. I  went to Longfellow, which, with the integration program, all the kids  from all over town were sent to fifth year centers, and so I had a multi-ethnic  group that came through. I taught, again, in an open classroom,  but there were only three at a time, and so we   d team teach with three  classrooms that were open at a time, so you could hear what was  basically going on in the other two classrooms.  I taught reading, language and history, and then the next teacher would  teach math and science and the next one taught social studies and  handwriting and everything. So we each had our specialty, almost like  high school, and then we   d move the kids through. Had some great  10  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  experiences there. But that was where I decided that I wanted to become  a principal. I worked for a guy named Buffy Brewer, who was a  principal who was really good at delegating. I   ll use that real carefully,  and so a lot of times I got pulled in to help do administrative type things  with parents and whatever and built a lot of confidence with thinking,     You know what? I think I might be able to run a school. I don   t think  it   s all that tough. If Buffy can do it, I can do it.    And he recommended  me to begin the internship program for administration.  How long was that process?  It took, well, about a year to apply for it, to get into it, but then the actual  internship you had to be selected by a principal to get to go do it, and  that was one semester. So you spent a semester preparing for it with  classes, besides the fact you had to already have your administrative  certificate finished, which was thirty hours past your master   s degree. So  at that time I was a single momma with two little girls trying to figure  out how to get through finishing my administrative certificate, raising  two little girls, and deciding to become a principal.  So where did the Air National Guard come into play?  Very good question. I guess while I was still at Van Buren, it was the  year that Oklahoma City Teachers decided to strike. Now, I was very  poor, I was a single mom then, very poor, couldn   t figure out how in the  world to feed my kids. My husband had been crushed in a motorcycle  wreck. He was driving to work one morning, was run over by a mass-transit  bus. And so I was working at McDonald   s when school wasn   t in  session, I was a church secretary and teaching, and here we were getting  ready to go on strike, and while I wasn   t a member, all my friends were.  I wasn   t a union member because I frankly couldn   t afford the dues. And  they were going,    You can   t cross the line, you just can   t cross the line,  you can   t do that.    And so I was talking to one of our elders at church,  and he said,    Why don   t you join the Air National Guard? We   ll keep  you working all the time that you   re not in school, instead of working at  McDonald   s and church secretary and all that other stuff, you know, it   ll  give you a great chance.    And I thought,    Ah  I   ll get to be with adults,     (because I had two little babies at home) and then I   d go to school with  little bitty kids, second graders.    That would be wonderful to have adult  conversation      So when the teachers went on strike they were wonderful, they pushed  me through. I got to go to basic training while the strike was going on,  so I didn   t have to go on strike. I didn   t have to cross the picket line, and  I didn   t have to lose my salary. So that was very good. And I did join the  Air National Guard and went off to basic training and the rest was  11  history. I loved it. By the way, I joined as an airman basic with a  master   s degree. A master   s degree and slick sleeve, no stripe enlisted  and went through Air Force basic  training . And while I thought this  was going to be with adults, I was the eldest member of the flight when  we got there, and so I was put as the dorm chief over about fifty  eighteen-year-olds. So I really didn   t get a break at all. They weren   t real  adults, but it was a different pace and a very different environment. So  again, it was one of those things that was fate. I got really lucky.  In my whole career I   ve always said I   d rather be lucky than good. I  didn   t have to take the hit that a lot of the teachers did with the strike, I  got a chance to start an entirely additional career to what I was doing,  and had been devastated at the loss of my husband and so this was a real  chance to reinvent myself, to find those qualities that gave me strength  to figure out that I could do anything. It was the first time I   d ever been  away from my little girls, and I was gone for six weeks, so it was tough.  That was the hardest thing that I   d ever done in my life and to date it is  the hardest thing I   ve ever done. Going off and leaving my babies with  my mother, who was a saint. Had it not been for her, I   d have never  survived. And yet I actually lived forty miles from them, so it wasn   t  possible for them to help me on a daily basis. And by the way, both of  them were still working full-time. But they took the girls, and I felt  comfortable because my daughters adored their grandparents, so it  worked out mentally okay for me.  I survived all that, came back home, went to training   okay, are you  ready for this? As a draftsman for an engineering squadron, and so I,  who could not even draw stick figures, became a draftsman, and it was  an interesting experience. I was with all guys then. The engineering unit  was all men, and I was sent to my little cubbyhole to draw little circles  and squares everywhere. It was very interesting. I spent a lot of time  with the guys there, and I had several people who then took an interest in  my career and were crucial in setting my pace for the future and helping  me gain a commission. Colonel John Strickland was in civil engineering,  and by the way, civil engineers used the draftsmen as well as the  engineers did, the electrical engineers. They would, between them, find  days for me to work when I wasn   t in school. So if it was on a fall break  or Christmas break or spring break or summer, they kept me busy every  day working. So it was very helpful to me financially, but more than  that, they really started grooming me, telling me that it was very  important that any time I was outside I had my cover on. It was really  important to set a standard of belief that you carried yourself with a little  more dignity. Sooner or later, I had to apply three times, but I finally got  accepted to an officer opportunity, and it was very interesting, because  there were not very many women in the Guard at that time   in fact, we  were still limited to two percent by law, and that changed right after that.  12  But I got an opportunity, sort of back-handed.  Three of us had been selected for a Second Lieutenant   s position as an  administrative officer. Now, back in those days, you didn   t have to have  a degree, you could go to officer training without a degree. I was the  third choice. The first one had a baccalaureate degree in business, and  this was going to be in administration, so that makes sense. It kind of  went along with that, but he had never been deployed and never been  away from home. So he went merrily off to this six weeks of training for  officer   s school and after about the third week, self-eliminating came  home because his wife was very upset that he was gone that long, and it  was just too hard on her. So he self-eliminated, came back home, and we  had to wait, of course, for another cycle and then the second guy got it.  This guy didn   t have a college degree at all, but had been in the guard a  long time, was a great guy. But when he went to officer   s school, he  couldn   t pass it academically, and so he was eliminated and came home.  Finally the commander said,    Well, we   re down to the third choice, I  guess we   ll send her.    And so I went and I came back as the honor  graduate. And that, I was sort of like,    Okay, in your face. I was your  last choice, but I got to be first in the class.    So it was really another  encouragement to say,    You could do it.     And of course, I worked for folks all over the base as an administrative  officer, and the wing commander gave me opportunities to do special  days for him and trained me in executive support and those kinds of  things. The civil engineers were wonderful, I felt like that was my first  home. Colonel Strickland, who became the commander of Civil  Engineering later, became the support group commander and he was the  person who literally recommended me for my first command. I   d  worked as an administrative officer for the wing commander, so I  learned everybody on base and learned the missions on base, so you had  this big broad spectrum view of what was going on. I didn   t know at the  time that it   s usually the exec utive  officer for the wing commander that  ends up having a really great career because of the broadening  experience that you have. But I was a jack of all trades. I felt I was a  master of none. I worked in the mission support squadron, I worked in  the mission support group, I was kind of moving around. I was the  education officer, which made sense,  since  I was a teacher.  And then came the opportunity of a lifetime. For whatever reason,  Colonel Strickland and Colonel Terry Raison decided the base needed a  woman commander. And there was a unit that probably didn   t need an  awful lot of oversight, so I might be all right there, you know, a bunch of  tough old guys, a real grizzled group, and that was called    services.     Now, services would be appropriate for a woman to command because  it   s food and housekeeping. You billet people, so I got sent to hotel  13  restaurant management, which I may do as another career somewhere in  my life, but the war-time tasking for that job was mortuary, and so not  only did I get hotel and restaurant management and food-services types  of training, but I also went to a whole school. To become commander of  that organization was a lot of schooling that I did at Wright-Patterson  Air Force Base. I   d go for a two-week course and go home, teach awhile  and go back for another two-week course. I think there were like five  different courses that were involved with that. So I spent a lot of time up  at Wright-Patterson.  It also happened to be the time that the Gulf War kicked off, the first  Gulf War. So being a mortuary officer, fully qualified in services, we  were called to back-fill the Air Force. At that time, the Guard wasn   t  ever put in as front-line folks. We were sent to refill or backfill the Air  Force. So I was sent to Dover, Delaware, that   s where the bodies were  received that came in from the Gulf. The Gulf War was very short, very  brief, and so we weren   t on duty for a very long time. It was a very brief,  I think, twelve day engagement. There were not a lot of bodies, but I did  get to do my first autopsy, my first experience during the Gulf War.  Came home, became a very successful commander. We learned a lot of  very valuable lessons because food service touched everyone on base as  well. Everyone came through to have lunch in the dining hall. By the  way, I was real instrumental in changing the name from    the mess hall,     which is what the Army always called dining facilities, to    the dining  facility.    We changed the way we served food, we changed the way we  presented ourselves to the Air Guard, and our unit won Outstanding Unit  in the Air Force two years in a row, as commander. So that made the  guys think maybe I did know something. Really what I knew was how to  write, and I could write up the award so we did very, very well. From  that came the opportunity then to go back to my original home, which  was mission support squadron, and become the first woman commander  there, which made me automatically the first woman base commander.  The mission support squadron, the commander there was the  commander of the base, or the entire facility, because you owned the  things from security forces, or police, civil engineering, the food  services, so I was now the second level manager over that. So it was a  growth opportunity.  Again, I had some great guys who were great role models who  empowered me and gave me an opportunity to do things that I really  shouldn   t have had any chance of doing. Held that job for two or three  years, then they asked if I would go and be the logistics squadron  commander. Now when I say they ask you, they don   t really ask you,  they come and tell you,    We   re going to put you in this job,    and I said,     I don   t know anything about logistics,    because that   s supply, and it   s  14  very involved and engaged. You have to understand all the rules and  laws about acquiring things and distributing things across the base. A lot  of those people get in trouble because, obviously, it has to do with huge  sums of money, like up to ninety million dollars a year. But I decided,     Okay, I   ll try it, I   ll give it a shot, if you think I can do it.    That meant  going back to school again, going to supply officer school and logistics  school. I felt like I was constantly going to school, never really getting  the hang of all of the things that I was doing. Most of the guys that were  there were in that unit for their entire career. They stayed with it the  whole time. So I kept thinking,    Well, is this a real good deal, or am I  such a screw up they keep moving me to someplace else?    But we  always won awards where I was, and we always ended up doing a really  good job and a great mission.  I held that job for about three years, and then they gave me the  opportunity of a lifetime, and I say that with tongue in cheek. The wing  commander had changed, and I thought,    Uh-oh,    because I had been  the fair-haired child of the former wing commander. This wing  commander was not necessarily a fan of the former wing commander,  and he called me in. I thought,    Okay, this is where I   m getting my head  handed to me. I   m done.    At that point, I didn   t have quite twenty years  in, and I was a little nervous. I thought,    I need to have twenty years if  I   m going to have any kind of after-life.    But instead when I came in, he  said,    The Aero-medical evacuation unit is in real trouble. They   re  getting ready to be the first Guard-led unit in a joint training exercise.     Now this was when we first started joint-ness, and the Guard was kind  of behind the power curve, and here we were going to go out to Fort  Polk, Louisiana, and we were going to be the lead medical unit for this  huge exercise that brought in about ten thousand people. To say I was  overwhelmed was putting it mildly, and I immediately said,    Well boss,  I   m not a medical officer, and I   m not an aviator,    because Aero-medical  evacuation meant we flew in, picked up. You had to have very special  training to get wings and you talk about a lot of schooling.  And he said,    I don   t care. You know people, and we   ve got to get these  people ready for this big event. And oh yeah, as soon as you come home  from that, we have this huge inspection that determines whether or not  the unit even gets to stay alive.    And I went,    Great, no pressure.    But I  was really lucky, because there were a couple of folks in the unit who  were former teachers, were great mentors, and even though I was senior  to them in rank, they were very good about helping me learn how to do  the things that needed to be done. So I became qualified as an Aero-medical  evacuation support officer, and so again, more training, more  schooling, and I didn   t have an awful lot of time to do this and get ready.  But what I found out, when I asked them for a briefing, I said,    Tell me  what our short areas are. What is it we really need to work on?    They  15  went,    Well, we   ve got forty airmen that have never gotten promoted.     That   s huge. That   s gigantic.    And oh yeah, by the way, the nurses don   t  have all their certifications to be able to go to this inspection, and we  don   t have any of our education and training records. They   re all out of  date.    So I went back to the wing commander and said,    Okay, here   s  what I need. I need money for training, I need days so that I can bring  these people in and get them ready, and we need to have an opportunity  to really exercise and practice this.    And he said,    Okay.    I mean, I had  just asked for the moon, and he not only handed me the moon, but he  gave me a couple of stars as well.  And so we did. We pulled these people in, got them trained, and in an  intensive time I promoted forty airmen to staff sergeant overnight. It was  wonderful, because they finished their training. So morale was really  high, everybody was pumped. I got the nurses the specialized training  they had to have, which they would   ve had to pay for on the outside, so  it worked for their civilian job as well as what they were doing for the  Guard, so they were happy. So it was one of those things, a win-win  deal, and you   re very excited. I got promoted to Lieutenant Colonel at  that point. We did go into the exercise, and we blew them away, and we  ended up with an Outstanding, which is the highest rating you can get in  an inspection. And it helped pull the wing, that was at a Satisfactory, up  to an Excellent. So I was the queen of the base for a day or two, and then  they pulled me out of there and put me into another unit. I loved it. To  be truthful, I thought it was going to be the most   and it was   the most  difficult assignment I   d ever had, but it was also one of the most  rewarding. I still stay in touch with a lot of my air-evac uation  folks  around the country because this was a whole national exercise. They  dropped two thousand young soldiers out of airplanes at night, and we  had to go recover them, so it was very interesting, and again, my first  joint experience working with Army.  I like to take credit for a nation-wide response. When we went in, I was  going to be the last speaker to speak when we had this big joint exercise  thing going. We had the Marines in there,    Ooh-rah,    and they   d go all  through their whole thing, and then the Army came in and they    Hu-ah     and we didn   t have very many Navy, but then I got up to represent the  Air Force, and I   m going like,    All I can tell you is that in Air Force,  you know, we   re a professional force, we duh duh duh duh, and I would  have to say that our whole take on the entire existence is    cool-man.        And from there on, all of the Air Force guys start going,    Cool, we   re  cool.    It kind of fits the mentality of Air Force, which sees itself as the  professional, executive, and easy-going force in the mix, and so we  laugh a lot because a lot of times I   ll hear people say,    Hey, Air Force  cool.    And I love that. That was a lot of fun.  16  So then when we got back, I   ve now been a flight commander and three  squadron officer commanders, and the wing commander called me in,  and he said,    Okay, I want you to come to work for me full-time and I  want you to be the administrative officer for the support group.    Now,  there were no women support group commanders because that was  really an 06 or a Colonel billet, but he said,    Now, you   ll have to get in  line. I   m not promising you an 06, but you know, it   s a chance to make  Colonel somewhere down the road. I   ve got to tell you, though, there   s  three guys in front of you.    And I thought,    Three. That seems to be a  prophetic number, doesn   t it?       Okay, all right, I   ll do it.    So I got called  by the adjutant general immediately, because he found out that I had  been put into that slot, and he said,    I need you full-time.    And I said,     Well, Sir, I   ve only got twenty-four years in the school business, I can   t  really afford to leave, because that   s not much teaching time for  retirement.    He came over and he bent over the table and he wrote down  a number. He said,    This is what an active-duty Colonel makes, and I   ll  promise you a Colonel slot.    Now there hadn   t been any women  Colonels, and when I looked at the number, it was double what I made  as a principal. And I said,    I can do that job. I can do that.     And so I went to work for Steve Cortright, the adjutant general of  Oklahoma. Very exciting times. Talk about learning from a fire hose. He  was a fighter pilot, which I had always flown in the big plane end of the  world, and he had been a real two-star  general . A lot of times our  adjutant generals grow up in the Guard, and so they   ve never had active  duty time, but he had been the assistant to the commander of Pacific Air  Forces. Sharp, sharp man, typical fighter pilot guy. Tall, thin, looked like  he was about thirty-five. He was really about fifty-eight, fifty-nine, I  guess. Sharp, sharp man. Never took no for an answer.    You will find a  way to do it, and you   ll bring me three examples of the way you can do  it, and three alternatives. Don   t ever come and tell me you have a  problem unless you have a severe answer for it.    And I told you I don   t  do debate, because I don   t like, you know, I pick a side, I go with it, I   m  gutsy. Now I   m not only going to have to tell you the pluses and  minuses of everything, but I   m going to have to actually recommend one  of those choices to you.  During that time, the  Alfred P.  Murrah  Federal Building  bombing  happened  in Oklahoma City , and it just so happened that I happened to  be the only mortuary officer in the state at that time qualified. And that  went back two jobs ago, but they called and asked if I would come  down, and I did. I worked eighteen-hour days, would not go home,  would not quit. I   d go home long enough to shower, change clothes,  sleep for a couple hours, and go back to work. I was very driven. I was  the only woman in the mortuary group, and so I was asked if I would do  the identification and the notification of the children. The guys had a  17  really hard time with that emotionally, and because I dealt with little  children for so long, I looked at it as an opportunity to do a service to  their families, because we were finally helping them find closure. So that  was about twenty-four days straight that I did that. I was actually still a  principal at that time, so the school district released me and I went down  to do that. That   s when I met General Cortright. That   s the reason he  came and said,    I want you to come work for me full time.     From there I worked, I guess, four years, five years for the adjutant  general, and spent a lot of time putting out fires, learning how to deal  across state lines, working with the National Guard Bureau. One day I  walked in, because twice a year you submit names for general officers to  the Guard Bureau for promotion, and I went in to the adjutant general  and I said,    Here   s your list of guys,    in other words, all the Colonels.  You had to produce their dossiers, their backgrounds, all this kind of  stuff. And of course, I   d been a Colonel now for four years myself, and  he said,    You   re missing someone.    And I said,    No Sir, we   ve got them  all there, they   re all the people who are eligible.    He said,    Where   s  yours?    and I said,    My what?    and he said,    Your nomination packet.     I quite literally was struck so dumb, because I   d never even considered, I  was just thrilled to death to have made Colonel. So I went back to the  personnel guy and I said,    Don   t you tell anybody, don   t you say  anything.    I said,    We have to put together a packet for me.    And he  started laughing. And it was a young man that I had mentored and  brought up from enlisted to officer, and they already had all the stuff  working and ready. I was the only one who was clueless about it. And I  was selected to be the assistant adjutant general for Air. And the rest was  fun and storybook.  I was selected, became the first woman general. It was very exciting,  very heady. I was very full of myself, excited at the opportunity.  However, it brought with it some sadness, because it was just as we  kicked off 9/11, had OIF  Operation Enduring Freedom  and OEF   Operation Iraqi Freedom  and for the first time in the state   s history, I  actually sent Oklahoma   s sons and daughters off to real combat. It was a  very tough job, very tough, but we didn   t lose anybody, they were  marvelous. The Tulsa unit fighters had been doing southern watch and  northern watch for several years, so they had actually flown real combat  missions, and now the air lift unit was deployed, the first units in before  there were even bases built. They landed on dirt and helped set up the  very first flying units that were established in the desert. They airlifted  people and things in to mount the assault on Iraq. They didn   t let me go.  They didn   t let me go at all. They didn   t want general officers,  particularly Guard general officers, messing up their work, but one  picture that I   m very, very proud of is I stood on the flight line and  saluted all of our guys leaving. And that picture was on the cover of all  18  kinds of magazines. All you saw from the back was it was a woman,  standing, saluting the planes as they departed. But they all came back  home. It   s something you take very seriously, when you talk about the  men and women you serve with, and their going off to face an uncertain  future. You just pray that you   ve trained them well, that you   ve given  them all the supplies and the opportunities they need in order to be the  greatest fighting force in the world, and they were. Oklahoma won all  kinds of accolades and awards during their deployments. They carried  more tonnage and more people than any other state   s Air National  Guard, and we had some great young soldiers who were security forces  who won bronze stars and came back as real true heroes.  So with the successful conclusion, obviously OIF and OEF are still  going on, nine-and-a-half years later, so we didn   t end all of the  exercise, or all of the fight, it   s still going on, but Oklahoma continues to  serve, even today, flying missions and flying people and things in and  out. However, the unit was changed from an air lift unit now to an air  refueling mission, and the 137th now refuels out of Tinker Air Force  Base.  Then I got a shot at my second star, which was unbelievable, even for  me. I   d kind of gotten used to doing things that other girls hadn   t had a  chance to do, but I was going to finally get to go back to my area. I was  going to be an Air National Guard assistant to the commander of area  education training command in San Antonio, Texas. Now, while I was  the commander of the Oklahoma Air Guard, I was also part-time, or  what they called a dual hat, and was an assistant to the Secretary of the  Air Force for Financial Management. Also had no financial management  background. Again. Okay, so go try and learn what it means to do  requirements, what trends in analysis are, and try to figure out how to  get more money from the Active Duty Air Force into the Guard. And we  did. We had a record budget year. So I really believe that   s what I ended  up getting the second star for was more than for being the commander of  the Oklahoma Air Guard, although when asked what my favorite job  was of all my life, I say being the commander of the Oklahoma Air  National Guard. Twenty-five hundred of Oklahoma   s sons and daughters  that are the finest patriots in the world.  So I   m excited, I   m going down to San Antonio, I   ve been in the  Pentagon, and I   ve been here in Oklahoma, and I   m going to get to go to  San Antonio and be on the Riverwalk, much relaxed. General Bill  Looney  III , who is an Oklahoman, was the commander of area  education and training command, that   s a four star, a real general, as  they like to tell us. One stars and two stars and even three stars are  Brigadier General, Major General, Lieutenant General, but if you   re a  real general, you   re a four star. And so I got to go work for the four star,  19  and I remember walking into his office, absolutely overwhelmed,  standing at the position of attention, and saying,    Sir, I   m very excited  for the opportunity to serve with you.    I said,    However, I will have to  tell you, I   m not real smart, but I work real hard.    And he laughed, and  he said,    Well, you   re an Okie. I would expect you to not be too smart.     And we began a great and wonderful friendship and relationship, and he  actually flew to Oklahoma to pin my second star on me in the Blue  Room of the Capitol, and that   s a huge honor. That doesn   t happen very  often. So I had the governor of the state of Oklahoma, Brad Henry, and a  four-star General pinning on my two stars. And he told that story at my  pinning. He said,    She said she wasn   t very smart, and she was right,  she   s not, but she does work hard.     That was a really exciting day, and I got to address the Legislature, and I  got to spend time talking to the folks about this really unique  opportunity for a hairy legged girl from Dale, Oklahoma. Something I  never dreamed of, never thought of, but I do find that it   s always about  being prepared. Make sure you have everything done. It   s like waiting  until you   re third at the shot, but if you   ve got everything done, you can  step into it, and know that you   re ready to go do it. Training is crucial.  For years, that   s what the Guard did was we trained to go to war, we  trained to go to war, we trained to go to war. Oops, here   s the war. Are  we ready, are we trained? And the answer was yes, we were.  While I was in San Antonio, my husband got to come down and spend  some time with us and it was a very relaxed environment after what I   d  been in the Pentagon with. Pentagon, I worked eighteen hour days,  working for the Secretary of the Air Force, besides trying to learn what  financial management meant and traveling across the nation to spend  time at different state headquarters for the different Air National Guards  in order to talk to them about what their needs were and what we needed  to help them do as far as money. I became good friends with the  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management, John  Vonglis. Mr. Secretary is still a good friend of mine. I just was notified  they finally ended their career time in Washington, he   s retired and gone  back to the State of New York, of which I gave him my apologies.    I   m  sorry,    I said,    You should   ve moved to Oklahoma, I don   t know what  you were thinking.    But that   s the great part of the experience of being  in the big Air Force is all of the wonderful people that you get to meet,  all across the nation and certainly in Washington.  So in San Antonio we played a lot of golf. It was a very relaxed mode, a  very rejuvenating mode. I got to fly T-38s and got sick a lot, but it was a  lot of fun and very exciting to fly with, because it   s a flight training unit,  so I got to do a lot of great stuff. Then I got a phone call, after I was  there about eighteen months, and it was the director of the Air National  20  Guard, Craig McKinley, who went on to become Chief of the Air  National Guard, the four-star. He was the three-star at the time. He said,     Rita, don   t you know Roger Brady?    and I said,    Sure, General Brady  is from Oklahoma. He graduated from Midwest City High School.  We   ve been buddies for a long time.    Of course, he was a star ahead of  me. He said,    I need you to come back to Washington to work for him in  Air Force Personnel.    And I said,    What? Back to the Pentagon?    He  said,    We really need you to do that, because we   re having real trouble  getting the kind of support that we need out of Air Force and we need to  make sure we   ve got people ready to integrate, and we   ve got to make  sure that we get enough of the right kinds of ranks and things to do that  with.    And I said,    Sir, you know I   m not a personnelist. I mean, I know  I was a mission support group commander, and that handles personnel,  but you know I   m not a personnelist.    He said,    That   s alright, you   re a  people person. You   ll find a way to make Roger love you. He loves you.  We want him to love the Guard.     But General Brady was notorious for not liking the Guard, and when he  became the director of personnel for the Air Force, or Chief of Staff,  Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Personnel  Management, Guard found itself in pretty hard times. We had hard times  getting promotions, we had hard times getting general officers through,  we had a hard time looking at the right mix, because the Air Force was  deciding to downsize so that we could afford to pay for new airplanes.  We took it off of the backs of the airmen by cutting our numbers and  cutting our ranks and cutting our structure in order to be able to provide  new aircraft, new technology, because Air Force prides itself in being  the technological branch of the military.  So I said goodbye to General Looney and packed up and went back to  the Pentagon. I had literally a closet as an office, with a sliding door. It  reminded me of my bathroom at home. I had a sliding door on my  bathroom and I went,    Oh well, here we are, big time.    But it was a  great opportunity. General Brady did not love the Guard but he did love  me, and he allowed us to do some things that we   d not been able to do.  So it pleased the director of the Guard. But it was a part-time job.  So the day came when General Brady got his fourth star, he was a three-star  at the time. He got his fourth star and he was going to go be the  commander of Air Forces Europe and I said,    Don   t you want me to  come with you? Are you sure you don   t want me to come to Rammstein  with you?    And he said,    No, I think not.    So I tendered my resignation,  because I was going to be sixty, and General Brady was leaving, and I  said,    What else can I possibly do?    I went in to the director and asked  to be allowed to retire, and he looked at me and he said,    Well, if  anybody   s earned it, it   s you.    But he said,    You could stay two more  21  years as a two-star.    I said,    I   ve done what I   ve done, and it   s time to  go home. I   m ready to go back to Oklahoma.    So I did.  I got to retire at the Women   s Memorial, which I am very, very proud of.  They have what they call the Hall of Honors, which is all of the state  flags and the four territories, and on the phalange of the Oklahoma Flag  it says,    Major General Rita Aragon, Commander of Oklahoma Air  National Guard.    We raised a lot of money at my retirement to be able to  pay for that. Instead of doing a regular retirement, we did the retirement  in Washington at the Women   s Memorial, and General McKinley retired  me. Then I came home and we had a huge party at the Army Readiness  Training Center here in Oklahoma, which housed about, I think they  figured we had about 300 people who came. I said,    No presents, don   t  bring any of these plaques and stuff, I   ve got plenty of    I love me    stuff,  but make a donation to the Women   s Memorial.    And so we raised  about  18,000 to send to the Women   s Memorial, a place that is very  near and dear to my heart, because it   s the first memorial ever dedicated  to women in the nation. If you go to other countries, most of the  militaries have entire monuments erected to the women who served in  the military. In the United States, we have not, and in DC on the Mall,  we had one small memorial to nurses that they had raised the money for,  military nurses had raised the money for Vietnam nurses and erected a  statue, but this is an entirely beautiful museum and monument at the  gates of Arlington cemetery. The gates there are grey stone, and they  had really fallen in disarray since being erected, and being women, as  usual, we went in and fixed stuff, so we repaired the giant pillars that  had huge eagles on top of them and built this beautiful memorial to  women who have served.  It was very exciting, at the dedication there were over 33,000 women,  most of them WWII and Vietnam era women who had never had any  recognition at all, and so the memorial is a living, breathing entity where  it   s very interactive. You go online and you can find the women who  have served in the military, what their jobs were and what they did, and  it really, literally, gave a voice to women in the military. And again, I  have to thank General Cortright, Steve Cortright. He allowed me to take  a hundred women, fifty Army and fifty Air, in a C130 up to Washington,  D.C. and we were the only women   s group to march in the opening  ceremonies at the Memorial. It was very exciting. He led the  organization. Our commander at the time, Jed Wright, who was a state  senator and Ronnie Turner, who was the commander of the Air Guard at  the time, marched in front, led us, a hundred women, into the Women   s  Memorial. It was a thrilling and exciting adventure, and on the big mural  that they have on the day that it happened, you can see the Oklahoma  Air Guard sitting right there, all of us together, Army and Air Guard. It  was a very exciting opportunity. One of those things that, in my memory  22  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  bank, will stand out forever, because men recognized us.  And you retired in 2007?  I did. 2007, December 3, because that was my birthday. I turned sixty  years old and retired.  Well, going back, was your family thrilled that you were going into the  military?  Oh no. Of course, my dad had always been very   I really kind of  thought about wanting to do it out of high school, and going to ROTC,  and getting my way paid for college. Then I got the scholarship and my  dad, who had worked at Tinker Air Force Base, was very familiar with  the military, but he had four Fs, so he was not able to join the military  during Korea, WWII and Korea, and so he had never served in the  military, but he had served the country by working at Tinker. So no, they  weren   t real pumped on it. I had a chance to go to Harvard, as a female  general officer, and I was asked there by one of the Russian generals if  my father had allowed me to join the military. I said,    Well, no, I was  already an adult, I was a mother of two children, and I decided to join  myself.    And he said,  in Russian accent     So, your husband let you join  military?    and I said,    Well, no, I was a single mom, I wasn   t married.     And he said,  in Russian accent     I had two daughters. I never let them  join military.    I said,    Really? Are they retarded? What   s wrong with  them?    And he didn   t appreciate the humor of that, but later on he did.  And the truth was that, no, my family wasn   t real excited about it, but  once I made General, my dad was real cool. He thought that was all  right. Actually, they were very supportive, since they were the ones that  had to take care of my girls.  I ended up remarrying, in 1981, right after I   d become an officer, and  my husband had four children, and I adopted his four kids, and of our six  kids together   my two girls and his daughter and three sons, we had  three boys and three girls   my daughter went into the Air Force and  made it to Captain, and they put her through medical school and she   s a  physician   s assistant. Our oldest son is a Sergeant Major, which is the  highest enlisted rank in the Army, and still serves today. My daughter is  out, she has a little girl that   s seven years old, so two of the six followed  into the military, and they   re all very patriotic kids. All of them are, you  know, they go like,    We know, Mom, God and country, we got you.    So  it did change the way that they looked at it, and the way that my parents  looked at it. And they   re very proud. They have my picture as an airman  basic, and then as a general officer, hanging on their wall at home.  Side by side.  23  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Side by side.  Before we get to your Harvard story, is it tough to be a woman in the  military?  I always tell people, it   s a very different experience today. Today,  women comprise about twenty percent of the military, both active duty  and Guard and reserve forces. So there are career fields that are open to  women today that were not open when I joined in 1979. It was tough  back then. I say it was tough, I got great opportunities and great doors  were opened, but when I joined, most of the women that were in the  military were either nurses or they were administrative, secretarial types.  There were very few other career fields that were open to women, but  that   s changed over the last thirty plus years, and today the Air Force has  every one of its career fields open to women. I serve on a White House  commission that is getting ready to recommend to Congress that we take  the Women in Combat Exclusion Law out so that women, who really are  doing that today, by the way. They really are serving in ground combat  in Iraq and Afghanistan. Because of the culture that   s there, they must  have women that go in with them to knock down doors and go into  houses, because the male soldiers can   t have contact with women.  So today, no, it   s not tough. It   s a different set of experiences and a  different set of requirements and a different set of expectations than men  have going into it, even today. There are a lot of things that you   re going  to have to deal with. A lot of physical differences that we have to make  adjustments for. For instance, going on submarines. The Navy fought  women going on submarines because they   re very tiny spaces, and they  stay under water sometimes for several months at a time, and so you  really do have to have kind of separate support facilities for women. But  the Navy has done that now, and a good friend of mine was very  instrumental in making that happen. Rear Admiral Sonny Masso was the  Navy personnel director that said,    We   re going to do it. We   ll step up.  We   re going to outfit the ships.    So today there are no career fields in  the Navy, other than Seals, that are closed to women, and that   s because  that   s direct ground combat. Hopefully that   ll be overturned soon. There  are wonderful opportunities for women today. It   s a great way to get an  education, it   s a great way to build a career, it   s a great way to travel the  world and see the world that women have never really had in the past.  It   s an exciting time to be in the military today.  In summing up your story, and how you   ve been where you   ve been, I   ve  noticed a couple themes. Obviously hard work and mentoring, this  constant theme of mentoring.  Absolutely.  24  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Have you done a little bit of the same, yourself? Mentoring?  Oh absolutely. Absolutely. Not just to women, but to men as well. I  talked about the young enlisted person that I trained as a personnelist  and took with me, today he   s a major waiting to make lieutenant colonel.  Several of the young ladies in the Guard. But also, Air Force-wide, I  have young men and women who will say,    Will you write a letter for  me to get into this particular type of training, or to just get into the Air  Force, or to travel here?    Yeah, it is important. It   s crucial. In something  that is as technically expert as the Air Force likes to be, it   s very crucial  that you understand that an Air Force career is much more than a job. It  is your whole lifestyle. You have to change environments frequently,  you have to move from job to job, which in the world of business, we   re  doing it now, but that   s a brand new experience in that only at executive  levels do people really move from place to place.  In the Air Force, or in the military period, you change your entire family  and your work force very frequently. And it   s really important to have  people who will say,    You know, it   s important to be ready for the next  step. It   s important that you have not only your professional military  education and your civilian education under your belt, but here   s some  experiences you need to go have.    I will never forget, I had a friend in  civil engineering who really, quite literally, made fun of me. I did all of  my professional military education, of course, I already had a master   s  degree, then went on and got thirty hours past it, then started working on  my Doctorate, and I took on every volunteer opportunity there was on  the base. He laughed at me and he said,    Why are you killing yourself to  do this?    And I said,    Because I have to work harder to get the same  recognition that you get.    It ended up, he retired as a Colonel and I  retired as a two-star General. So I think that is proof in itself.  But it is absolutely crucial to have someone who   ll say,    You can do  this,    and what you have to do to do it. I always like to say I was lucky. I  was in the right place at the right time. It was that time in history when  things changed. It was that time in Oklahoma when we changed  leadership. It was that time, but I also say that the harder I work, the  luckier I get. And so hard work and luck, and having people who will  tell you,    You can do this,    and    Here   s how you need to.     I   ll never forget Captain, when I was enlisted, had been on active duty,  and he came into the Guard, and that was back in the day when the  Guard was considered the Boy   s Flying Club. No one wore their cover  on base. They just didn   t wear hats. It wasn   t a big deal. Who cares?  We   re the Guard, blah, blah, blah. But he   d come off of active duty, and  he looked at me one day and he said,    If you don   t have the integrity to  follow the rules, whether everybody else is following them or not, you   ll  25  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  never amount to anything.    And he was honest about it. I never saw the  man outside without his cover on. So I was never outside without my  cover on. And years later, I had some of the old guys that I had really  been educated by, some old enlisted guys who said,    You know, one of  the things that I admired about you most was you didn   t care what  everybody else was doing, you did what was right.    And that   s huge.  That   s huge and I take that all the way back to my parents, because that  was a big thing. My mother used to say,    So if everybody jumps off of  the building, are you going to jump, too?    You know, make your own  decisions, be responsible for yourself, have some integrity and some  backbone to do what   s right.  Did you ever think, in your wildest dreams going in, that you would  attain the two-star rank that you have?  Absolutely not. Like I said, there weren   t even any Colonel women. I  just thought,    If I make it to Major, I   ll be really happy. I can get twenty  years in, be a Major, that would be so cool.    Because, for the first three  years, of course I was enlisted, my big goal then was just to become an  officer and be called Ma   am and be saluted when I drove through the  gate. An aside, we drove into Tinker  Air Force Base  yesterday  afternoon, my daughter and my granddaughter and I were in the car, and  my daughter, who was the Captain   my granddaughter   s not been  around the military much because she got out right after Shelby was  born. She said,    Shelby, move on the other side of the car, put your  seatbelt on and watch when Grandma goes through the gate.    The young  lady rendered a really sharp salute. I   m in civilian clothes, but my ID  said that I was a general, and I mean, every one them stopped and they  saluted, and Shelby went,    Wow.    And I said,    Shelby, you know what,  that   s pretty much the feeling I still get every time I get saluted. Wow.     It   s a very cool deal.  Wow. Well tell me about Harvard. What happened?  I became this new one-star general and I   m very excited, whoo-hoo, and  I go to what they call charm school. My husband and I were required to  go to general officer training because the spouses of the generals,  normally women, are taught how to entertain and how to dine with  dignitaries and ambassadors and whatever. My husband, who is a very  independent gentleman said,    I   ll go with you, but I   m not having any  tea parties.    So we come back from charm school and I get this phone  call, and I perk up immediately because the guy comes rushing in, he  says,    General, you have a phone call.    I was at the guard base.    You  have a call from Department of Defense.    I   m thinking,    Oh, DOD, I   ve  already done something wrong.    So I answer, I say,    Yes, this is General  Aragon.       General Aragon, we need a female general officer that will  26  not necessarily be incensed by the lack of political correctness of the  Russian military.    I said,    Darling, do you know where I   m from? I   m  from Oklahoma. We grade political incorrectness.    I said,    What is it  that you need?    They said,    Well, we need someone to come to Harvard  to speak to the Russian military security course in the Kennedy School  of Government about why women are important to our military.    I said,     Okay.     So I go to Harvard in January  2003  and I   m very full of myself. They  did say,    This is an academic environment, and it is, by the way,  Harvard, which is very liberal, so you   re not going to wear your  uniform, no one wears uniforms, you   ll just wear civilian attire.    Well at  that point, I   d already been in the Guard full-time active duty now for  about five years, so my civilian wardrobe was a bit lacking. So it was  real exciting, I got to go shopping. I go to Harvard and I fly into Boston  and am feeling very full of myself. I have on a fur coat and my little high  heeled boots and I walk into the hall where we   re supposed to sign in,  pulling my little suitcase behind me. They fit you with a little ear piece,  because the only Russian I know I   d learned on The Hunt for Red  October with Sean Connery, and I could say do svidaniya and da, and  that was about it. Supposedly the Russians didn   t speak   now there  were eighteen Americans and twenty Russians and me, all men. The  Americans were all admirals and generals, one and two stars. The  Russians were all the way from one-star to three-star, with the  understanding that the chairman of the joint chiefs of the Russian  military would come to our final event.  So we   re all kind of excited, and I   m, again, intimidated, going,    What  are you doing here? You know you can   t speak for the women of  America, you sure can   t speak for the women of the military.    But I get  there and we   re fitted, and I used to laugh and say,    For the first time in  my life the voices in my head really were people talking to me.    They  were translating to Russian. And I hear this voice, this little man who   s  about my height and weighs about 300 pounds comes up and he says,  in  Russian accent     So, you are woman general?    and I said,    Yes, I am,  I   m Rita Aragon from Oklahoma. It   s a pleasure to meet you.    He says,   in Russian accent     Hm. You   re not real general, you   re Hollywood  general.    Remember, I   m not supposed to take offense to political  incorrectness. I said,    Well thank you very much, that   s very gracious of  you.    He says,  in Russian accent     No, no, no, I mean, you   re not for  real, you   re just for show.    And so began my experience at Harvard.  My whole thing was to teach them about what women in the military are  doing today in the United States, and we talked about, first I had to  overcome the whole gender thing. I talked to them about what their  mothers did and their wives and their daughters and their children. Yuri  27  Kalashnikov, by the way, was the gentleman who said that. He was also  the gentleman who told me he had two daughters that he would never let  in the military. General Kalashnikov   s grandfather,  Mikhail  Kalashnikov,  was the person who designed the Kalashnikov rifle. So  General Kalashnikov had a very long military family history. I tell  people, the AK-47, as we call it today, is used by thugs all around the  world to include the Russians. So it is one of those historic things. So  everyone is real in awe of General Kalashnikov, who is the three-star, by  the way. While they told us not to wear our stars, we all knew who the  one, two and three stars were. There was no doubt in anybody   s mind.  But because I had to break down that gender  gap , I did something that  I did all the time, even with the Guard guys. Again, I volunteered for  more things, I waited on and took care of and administered to the  civilities of the experience. They had told us to bring something to give  to everybody. I bought little candy bars, the little Hershey miniatures of  all kinds, the crispy, the crunchy, every deal, and I made my own  wrapper which, by the way, I stole the idea from the Capitol, because  they used to sell little bags of chocolates that had wrappers on them with  famous Oklahomans on them. So I had my staff help me, and we put a  little silver star on it that said    Brigadier General Rita Aragon,  Commander Oklahoma Air National Guard,    and we literally took glue  sticks and wrapped these candies   that tells you the old teacher part of  me coming out. So every morning I would lay a chocolate at  everybody   s place setting, because we sat at an amphitheater-type  setting with a desk in front of us and ear pieces, and we could hear all  the stuff going on. And it started to dialogue. They liked the chocolate.  The Americans liked the chocolate, too. It was kind of a barrier breaker.  All of a sudden they   re talking to me about, they gave me some of their  chocolate, it was nasty. It was like baker   s chocolate, bitter and yuck.  Waxy.  So it started the dialogue in talking about their wives, their children,  their daughters, their mothers.    Well, what do you admire?     In Russian  accent     My mother   s a very strong woman blah blah blah.       So why is  it that doesn   t translate to the military? Because, by the way, you   re  getting ready to go to an all-volunteer force, which is what we did in  1973. That   s what really opened the door for women to start in different  career fields. And when you go to an all-volunteer force, fifty-one  percent of Russia is female, so over half of the people that you have to  select from are going to be women. The key issue is training, leadership  opportunities, and mentoring. If you do those things, you will find that  they   by the way, it only takes a quarter pound of pressure to pull a  trigger on an AK-47, and it only takes a quarter pound of pressure to pull  the yoke back on an F-16 fighter. So it isn   t about brute strength, it   s  about knowledge, and about experience, and about confidence and  28  leadership.     So every night we   d move tables and we   d have these wonderful dinners  there at Harvard. The first night, of course, Harvard sponsored it and we  had lobster and crab and all the East Coast delicacies and the next night  the Navy hosted it, and the next night the Army hosted it, and the next  night, you know. So we   d go around, all of us, of course the night the  Air Force hosted it, we had steak. Manly food. It was very good. But the  very last night we were there at Harvard, the Russians are going to host  it. So we walk in, every night we   ve had these beautiful, wonderful  dinners at round tables, and everyone moves tables so that you get to  small group talk to each other. This night we have one huge long table  with a white tablecloth on it, and there are big baskets of hard bread and  big trays of cheese and a big tray of pickled stuff. Dill pickles, pickled  cucumbers, pickled beets, pickled chicken something-or-another, pickled  pigs    feet   I mean, everything was pickled, because that   s most of their  diet. I   m thinking I   m going to have some borscht, this   ll be good, and I  can make it on bread and cheese. But beside every place setting was a  huge decanter of 180-proof vodka. Every place setting had their own  bottle, and I   m going,    Uh-oh,    because every night those guys drank a  lot. I knew they did. And I understood in the culture that drinking vodka  is how they tear down their enemies. They absolutely get them blottoed.  This was a military dining-in, so every person would have a toast. And  in a military dining-in you make a toast, you throw back the drink, and  you turn the cup upside down on your head to prove you   ve emptied it.  No cheating. So they told me I would have the fifth toast, because they  figured I   d be comatose after that, with 180-proof vodka, and I thought,     You have no idea. Yeah.    So we started off, and we   d fill our cup, and  we   d toast to President Putin, and they   d go blah blah de blah de blah,  and we   d throw it back and we   d set the cup on top of our head, and it  was like liquid fire. And I thought,  gasp . I mean I literally couldn   t get  my breath. Immediately charge your glass again, so we poured it in  again, to George W. Bush, President of the United States, greatest  military mind on the face of the earth, blah de blah de blah. And they   d  just go on and on. You   d throw it back and put it on top of your head.  And my knees buckled. Literally. I mean, I   m going like,    I   ll never  make it to five.    But we sat down then. And they said,    Now you start  your food.    And I said,    Oh, what am I going to do? I mean, my head is  spinning, my throat   s on fire, my stomach   s on fire,    and I think quick,  think quick, think quick, and I had on a suit jacket. I reached over and I  picked up my bottle and I stuck it under my jacket, and I said,     Gentlemen, if you   ll excuse me, I need to go to the ladies    room.    So I  stand up and I go in and I pour out the vodka and I fill it up with water,  and I threw up the first two I   d already drank, because my stomach was  on fire. Stick it back under my jacket and I go back in, and everyone  29  stands.    Thank you very much,    we all sit down, and I put the bottle  back out on the table.  At that point General Kalashnikov comes over and he says,  in Russian  accent     Little General, do not hurt yourself.    Now I   m no longer  Hollywood General, I   m just Little General.    Little General, do not hurt  yourself. Russian vodka is made for men. You will hurt yourself  severely.    And I said,    Thank you Yuri. That   s so kind of you.    I said,     I   ll do my very best. You know, in Oklahoma, we drink a lot of vodka.  It   s kind of like our state drink.    And I   m going,    Oh.    So we continue  toasting, and we continue toasting, and we get to my toast. And I stand  up on the chair, because obviously I   m the shortest in the room, and I  want to be heard. And so I toast    to those men, who on silver wings defy  earth   s gravity to fly into the face of God and reign terror down upon the  enemies of the United State of America.    Brawls, brawls. Everybody  loved it. They love it when you talk about death and dying, that   s a big,  big thing. So I   m a hit with my toast, and I sit down. And we continue  toasting and eating and toasting and eating, and I have to admit, I wasn   t  eating an awful lot. I was eating some bread. One by one, the Americans  start, literally, falling out of their chairs across the room.  We get to the end of the evening and I   m still toasting with the Russians.  And of course, I   m acting a little tipsy, but Kalashnikov comes over with  the chairman of the joint chiefs, the four-star, and they look at me and  they say,  in Russian accent     You know, you are real general.    And I  say,    Well yes I am.    And everyone laughs when I talk about that,  because I said, it demonstrates exactly what I   m talking about. You  don   t have to be the toughest, and you don   t have to drink the most  vodka, but you do have to be smart, and you have to figure out what  your enemy is expecting, and you have to counter and do that. And when  I talk to young people today, because I get a chance to go down to  Maxwell Air Force Base and talk to them about leadership and about  command and about what you have to do, and I keep saying,    The most  important skill you have, the most important item you have, is your  brain. And if you   re smart enough to figure out what the enemy is  expecting, and you counter that, whether we   re talking about terrorists or  whether we   re talking about frontal assault. I went to war college. I  understand all the movement strategies and the tactics, but the truth is,  when you fall back to your own ingenuity, and your own brain power,  and you   ve studied your enemy and you know what they are looking at,  that   s the way we overcome. That   s what the United States has been  good at for the last three-hundred years is when we get pushed against  the corner, we figure out what has to be done and we do it, whatever it  takes. If it means getting Sputnik beat to the moon, or whether we   re  talking about having the first super-sonic aircraft, or whether we   re  talking about having the best surveillance system by satellite in the  30  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  world, America does that. That   s what   s great about this great nation is  the people who will not stop, who use their creativity, their ingenuity,  and their talents to defend this nation.    And I left Harvard as a hero, yay,  and was then asked to go to Russia to speak to them, which I never got  to do. And I   m very glad, because I don   t think I could   ve hidden  enough bottles there.  I don   t think so, but it would   ve been fun to try.  It would   ve been fun. I would love to go to Russia, I really would. I  would enjoy that very much.  Could you tell me about any stumbling blocks or adversity you faced  along the way?  Oh, there were a lot of them. What I tried to do is not look at events as  stumbling blocks, because I will tell you every time I was given a  different job, I thought that was going to be up. I thought that was going  to be the time. The hardest thing to overcome, when I was Commander  of the Oklahoma Air Guard, I had people say,    So is it hard to be a  woman and command all these guys?    I say,    No, it was hard not being  an aviator and commanding aviators, because aviators are what run the  Air Force, and therefore they think differently, they act differently, they  wear a different uniform, they wear that nice green bag that everyone  identifies with. But having been in Aero-medical Evacuation, I was  authorized to wear a bag, and so my first meeting with the fighter unit,  the F-16 guys, who by the way, are they guys who really do run the Air  Force, the pointy plane guys, we call them, I put on my flight suit and I  went up to them and assumed fighter pilot stance, which is hands on  your hips, your feet spread apart. Looking at them, I said,    All right,  gentlemen, do you want me to tell you how to fly those damn lawn darts  out there, or do you want me to let you do that, and I   ll take care of the  people and the money?    And they all went   it never occurred to them  that a non-aviator would tell them how to fly their airplanes. And  obviously I wasn   t about to, because I wasn   t a fighter pilot. I wasn   t a  C-130 pilot. I was not an aviator. I was a rated person only because I  was a commander of a flying unit.  So the first thing I had to clear out of the way was,    Okay, I could do  this, because I have the rank to do it, but as long as you don   t put one of  those in the ground, as long as you fly and you don   t get mishaps, as  long as you take care of the people with you, I   ll stay out of your flying  business, and I   ll take care of making sure you have the money and the  people to do what you have to do to conduct war. But make no mistake  about it, you start yanking around and you start doing things that are  stupid and you get safety violations, I   ll be right in the middle of you.     31  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  And by the way, I fired a lot of people. I talked about Sun Tzu   s theory  of war. He has several theories on warfare and fighting, but the number  one is    kill one, you impress a thousand.    So my job was always, every  unit I went to, everyone knew there was going to be one person who was  singled out and taken down, and it was whoever was the biggest screw-up  in the organization. Didn   t matter whether they were enlisted, didn   t  matter whether they were an officer, but I would come at you. My job  was always,    I will turn you around if you   re willing to turn around. I  will rehabilitate you if you   re willing to be rehabilitated. But make no  mistake about it my job is to make sure this unit is the finest of its kind  anywhere in this nation, and I will do that. I have a tradition of doing it, I  have the reputation for doing it, and I will do it.    And so usually, by the  third or fourth unit I got to, everybody   s going,    Who   s she after? Who   s  she coming to get? What   s happening?    And the truth was, that put me  in good stead, because then I didn   t have to do those things. The  reputation took care of itself.  Stumbling blocks to women are they   re very hesitant to step up to make  the hard calls. It   s hard to take someone   s livelihood away from them, to  fire them. That   s not an easy thing to do, but sometimes it   s what has to  be done. If people won   t rehabilitate, if they won   t change their  behaviors, if they don   t do what   and that   s the reason I never got in  trouble with the union when I was a principal. I   d always say,    Here   s  what you   ve got to do to meet the standard that you have to have,    and  in teaching it was always children first. In the military it was always  mission first. And if you can   t put that first, and if you can   t take care of  the mission, you really don   t have a seat at this table, and if you don   t  have a seat at the table, I need to bring in someone else who can. So  while you spend your time mentoring and training and educating. You  also have to be tough enough to say,    You   re not making it,    and be able  to make the hard call, and that is not easy. I don   t care whether you   re a  man or a woman. That   s not an easy call.  Some career highlights?  Well, obviously Harvard was one. Being the first woman commander  was one. Being the first woman general was one. Having the opportunity  to serve in the Pentagon was very exciting for a small town girl. I think  that there was something at every stage of my career that I would  consider a highlight, but when I talk to people, or I talk to classes, or I  talk to civic organizations, I always tell them,    The highlight of  anyone   s career, the pinnacle, is being able to say that people trust you  to make decisions. They trust you to be the leader. Even in the military,  where rank is the lead, you still have the informal leaders, those people  that you look to to get you through a rough spot.    I think the highest  32  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  accolades I ever had were from the young men and women who would,  at first, call me Colonel Mom, because they trusted me with their entire  existence, and then later General Mom. And I still have young men and  women today, some of them not so young, who will come up to me and  say,    This is my foster mom, this is my General Mom.    And they won   t  call me by my given name. Some of them are assistant attorney generals  of the state, some of them are surgeons, some of them are dentists, some  of them are nurses, some of them are enlisted members who have served  our nation very honorably, but for them to feel that they could call me     Mom,    is probably the highest accolade I could ever have. They trusted  me for their life. They trusted me to take care of them and to take care of  their career. I think that   s the highest praise anyone could be given,  particularly if you   re a mother, you understand that.  Well in 2009, you were inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame. What was that like for you?  Sort of surreal. I   m thinking, here are all these great women who have  changed the course of history, who have had remarkable roles in  Oklahoma, and here   s a hairy legged girl from Dale who got to do a  whole bunch of really fun stuff, got to fly in airplanes and got to travel  all around the world, to every continent except Antarctica (and I have no  desire to go there). It was really unreal, particularly to be nominated by  my good friend and, at that point, Congresswoman Mary Fallin. It was a  great, huge honor to get to go and to be with the other women that were  there. In my class were some outstanding women. Mrs. Henry, Susan  Edmondson, the Supreme Court Justice   s wife, who had also been  extremely involved in women in incarceration, who later, we became  very good friends and worked on incarceration of women issues. It was  an exciting time. My family was all there, my children, all of the  grandchildren that we could get there came, and to the grandkids, they  really didn   t understand it, but my parents did. It was very gratifying to  see the pride in their faces.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oklahoma. I often laugh when I   m traveling around the world and  people say,    You always say,    Hi, I   m Rita Aragon from Oklahoma.     Most people in the military never talk about where they   re from.    And I  say,    That   s because that red dirt clings to you.    And to think that you  represent that somewhere across the world is so exciting. Oklahoma is  my home. It   s my family, my great-grandfather came in the Land Run.  We   ve been here ever since. My children were born in Oklahoma. Most  of my grandchildren have been born in Oklahoma. There is something  about this state. We don   t have an awful lot of great resources, but we  have wonderful people. We have more great military leaders than any  33  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  other state per capita. We have more astronauts than any other state per  capita. We produce more entertainers, brilliant artists   it   s the people  that make Oklahoma. And I   m very proud to be one of them.  Well you   re getting ready to take on a new role.  I am.  Can you tell us a little bit about that?  I will be serving on the Governor   s cabinet, serving Oklahoma   s heroes  as the Secretary of Veterans    Affairs, and I   m very excited to continue  looking after those who have protected our freedoms throughout my  lifetime and before, and will continue to do that. It   s an exciting  opportunity to be the first woman to get to do that job, and to have a  chance to interact with the legislature, a lot of the veterans groups  around the state, and to try to work with the federal government to bring  better care to Oklahoma   s heroes here at home.  As we   re winding down the interview, if you could give advice to fellow  Oklahomans, do you have that one nugget that you would tell them?  I think the Army says it very well: Be all you can be. Don   t limit  yourself. Every human being has greater capacity than we   ve ever  known. Einstein had brain damage. He had tumors in his brain, and yet  he   s one of the finest minds we   ve ever known. Why? Because he  tapped his potential. And I would say that Oklahomans are such a giving  people. Oklahomans have great talent and resources, and I always say  it   s that red dirt. It makes you think about reaching out and reaching up,  and I   d say,    Be all you can be. Don   t be afraid to try.    I have a lot of  people who say,    Well how did you get to do that?    and I   ll say,     Because I wasn   t afraid to fail.    Don   t be afraid to take that next step.  My sister asked me one time, she says,    How come you got to be this  and that?    I said,    I was lucky, I was in the right place, and I wasn   t  afraid to fail. So if I fall on my face, there hasn   t been a woman do it yet,  so what happens? I   m just one more.    But the truth is, we all have  enormous capabilities that we haven   t even begun to tap. And the future  will bear that out. So I would say to all Oklahomans, be all you can be.  You have it within you. Reach deep into it.  I have one more question, but before I ask it, is there anything else you   d  like to add before we end today?  I don   t think so. I   m just very lucky that I had a mother and dad who  were very supportive of education. I had a wonderful husband who was  extremely tolerant of my being gone a lot. He passed away this past  34  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  Aragon  Nykolaiszyn  March. He was my rock, and he was the backbone of our family, so I   m  very, very grateful, and I   m very grateful to the men who took the time  to let a hairy legged girl learn a lot of stuff. Colonel John Strickland,  Colonel Terry Raison, General Steve Cortright, General Ed Stevens,  guys who let me play and who gave me a chance to try. I also owe an  enormous amount to some of my former coaches who still follow me  today. Harold Jones at Dale still sends me an    Atta Girl    when I do  something new and good. Friends that I had through the military. Those  are the things that help us have the courage that once there   s a stumbling  block there, we say,    You know what? Get up and go over it.    Friends,  mentors, leaders, and Oklahoma   s blessed with a lot of really great  people, so those would be the things that I am most grateful for. The  only thing that I could say is,    Nobody does it by themselves. Nobody  does.    I had a great support system all along the way, and hopefully I   ve  been helping to build that safety net for other people.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  Wow. Hadn   t thought about that. She wasn   t afraid to try, she gave it her  best shot, and she believed that everybody can do what they were meant  to do. And that she was a dog-gone lucky hairy legged girl from Dale.  Well thank you very much for joining us today. We really appreciate it.  Thank you. And I am deeply honored by the fact that you would take  this much time to talk to me. I know that I   ve left out accolades that I  should   ve given to an awful lot of people, but I   m excited to be a part of  Oklahoma   s history. To me, I think that   s the highest praise that I could  ever get is that I   m in some history books, and some day some kids will  say,    Well if that old lady could do it, surely I can do it.    And I hope  that is it. I hope that they believe that they can do whatever they want,  and dream as high as the sky.  I think that   s a great way to end our interview.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  -------  -------
