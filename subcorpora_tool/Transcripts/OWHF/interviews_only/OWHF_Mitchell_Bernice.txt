 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Wednesday, February 20, 2008, and I am in  Stillwater, Oklahoma interviewing Bernice Mitchell. This interview is  being conducted as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall  of Fame Oral History Project. Bernice Mitchell was inducted into the  Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame in 1995. Actively involved in politics,  Mrs. Mitchell was the first African-American woman elected to the  Board of County Commissioners for Payne County where she served ten  years. She currently serves on the Oklahoma Commission on the Status  of Women along with the Board of Directors for the National  Association of Commissions for Women. Thank you for joining us today.  Thank you for having me.  I wasn   t sure if your term expired on the National Commission...  Well I   m up for re-election this year.  Okay.  You run every two years, almost like the House, the legislative house  seats where you have to run every two years. This is my year to run for  re-election, and I   m serving on the Nominations Committee so (Laughs)  I suppose, in a way, it would be easy to maybe find somebody to slide in  there if I wanted to step down, but I   m going to file for re-election. It  really takes two years to figure out what   s going on, you know   to get  your feet wet, so to speak. And I   ve enjoyed meeting people from all  over. That   s always been my forte though. I just love meeting people  and the more the merrier, and from the many different places. That   s  even better.  We   ll get into your work within politics and the Commission, but first  let   s learn a little more about you. Give us a little background on where  5  Mitchell  you grew up and your early life.  Okay. I grew up in New Orleans, attending elementary and secondary  and high school, and graduating from high school there. I think back  sometime on what did I do before reaching high school, and in the sense  that   s a little bit of a blur. I know I was involved in a lot of things while I  was in high school and I graduated as a Ten Top Senior. I participated  in   oh, at the time   now I think it   s called like the    leadership group.     For us because I went to an all-black school, it was through the YWCA  or the YMCA that we were able to get into programs like that. I was  what they called a Y-Teen and had leadership roles with that. And I was  in the Dramatics Club   maybe that just says I like acting, I don   t know.  (Laughs) I can be a    ham    when I need to be, I guess. I was involved in  what we called then our reader   s group, and one of the things that we did  was to work with the kids that were in lower grades than we were kind  of thing, just to mentor them along, and that I love doing to this day. The  grandkids get that particular part of me though.  While in high school, when everybody   s thinking about going to college,  I knew there was no way that my parents could afford to pay or send me  to college. A very good   well, has since turned out to be a very good  mentor and friend   was a counselor there and she just simply said to  me,    Okay, so you don   t go now. You can go later,    and I took that to  heart. I graduated from high school and then went to business college for  two years   going at night, working in the day   to kind of pay my own  way, with the idea being that once I completed that and got a good job,  then I, of course, could pay my way through college.  But we had a little bit of an interference there, and that means I finished  the business college and started working at Xavier University and a fella  came along or had been along. We discovered this some time ago that  we were in first grade together, so we have been together for a long,  long time. We did not, however, start dating   quasi-dating   until our  senior year in high school, and with him going to college   he went to  Xavier, I just figured,    Well, that   s the end of that. I am on my own and  I need to really make my own way.    Instead in his senior year at Xavier,  he asked me to marry him and I did and the rest is history.  So that made me put the education part on hold. I knew that he was  headed for many great and wonderful things because he definitely  wanted to go to graduate school in biochemistry. It was like whoever  gives me, as a graduate student, I am sure you can probably understand  that   whoever wants me and will pay, that   s where I   ll go. So Michigan  State came calling one day and the next day Ohio State, but we   d  already accepted Michigan State, so off we went to Lansing, Michigan.  Stayed there for six years and with him wrapping up his PhD, it was  6  again    Where do we go from here?    and his major professor had a very  good friend here   a working or research buddy here at OSU   and they  talked about it.  We never came to Stillwater to see what it looked like or worried about  housing or anything because the professor on this end supposedly took  care of all of that. He accepted a research position here for two years,  and we thought,    We can live anyplace for two years.    So with three  kids and pulling a U-Haul, we arrived in Stillwater, America on January  2nd of 1967. Even on the way here I kept asking,    Where are we  going?    and    Where are you taking me and my kids?    It was just so, so  rural, you know, for having lived in New Orleans and then Lansing,  Michigan, which in a sense are very similar as far as lots of traffic, lots  of people and that kind of thing. And I guess for about six months I kept  asking that same question.    Now why are we here?    but with three kids,  and of course two of them school-age, you don   t have much time to sit  around and worry about that because kids being kids will get involved,  or want to get involved, in things. I sure didn   t want to hold them back,  saying,    Well, we   re only gonna be here two years so let   s wait,    and  consequently it   s a good thing I didn   t because as they got involved in  things, so did I.  At the end of the two years, he was offered a position with the  Biochemistry Department and accepted it, and so then we said,    Well,  you know, what   s three more years?    After that second time though we  figured this was it. We   ve made a home here, the kids are involved, I  started getting involved, and when my youngest one started to school  full-time, I decided now it   s time for me to go back to school. So I did,  part-time at first because I had to try and manipulate several schedules  there. Then it dawned on me after talking with my professor who  advised me in a lot of things and is a dear, dear friend to this day   that if  I was serious about it and would concentrate on it, I could really go  ahead and finish up. I thought,    Okay, let   s do that.     And along that trail, I guess, I started noticing some women   all of us  somewhat close in age, all had families   who had come in for lunch into  the cafeteria about the same time. We would chat and pretty soon we got  to calling ourselves the    Lunch Bunch    and then we would find that it  would really help because many of us were at different stages along the  way. Some were maybe a year ahead. Some were maybe a year behind.  Some were graduate students. And what it turned out to be really was  more of a   not necessarily a griping session, but a venting kind of thing  because we didn   t have someone or some office that you could go to as  an older returning student to sort of talk about all these things. So it  really became quite a nice luncheon klatsch. Some of them that had a  course could also say,    Well, I would suggest this and this.     7  The outcome of that, and I guess knowing where to go and complain at  times   became what   s now called   or was a couple of years ago   the  OSU Women   s Council. We had someone see us sitting around talking  one day, and our group kept getting larger and larger, and pretty soon  some of the women faculty would see us. Several of them would have  one or two of us in their class and so said,    What   s going on here?    and  we would tell them. They   d say,    Well, you know, we need to do  something about that,    and eventually this somehow got to the Office of  the Vice President, who at that time was Dr. Boggs. He had an assistant  Sheila Avery working for him who said,    Let   s do more than just sit  around and talk. Let   s kind of put this on another level,    and so then we  started having real big group sessions involving the students and the  faculty   female faculty   and even had retreats where we   d go down to  the city for a weekend. Just kind of in a sense lock ourselves in a room  and just debate all of this and talk about it and see what we could kind of  get as a plan.  That kind of reminds me of the old clich  ,    From little acorns grow big  trees,    because it really astonished me that just about the time that I  graduated, which was in    78, that group was beginning to actually have a  name and a presence of the Women   s Council on campus. So I like to  think that maybe I had a little bit of something to do with that. And it has  bloomed into I don   t know what now, but I was given their first  Outstanding Alumnae Award. That really made me proud because it  seemed like all I did was sit around with a group and we   d gripe and  we   d discuss. We even got to the point where, if necessary, we   d take  out paper and make notes and put them up so everybody could see, have  our own little workshop kind of thing.  When I graduated, I had worked in the campaign of someone who  worked here but was running, or saying that he was going to file for the  position of district judge. I worked in his campaign and he was  successful, and so he said,    Now when you graduate, you come up and  see me. I don   t know if we   ll have anything available, but come up and  see me if you   d like to get into the judicial kind of work area.    So I did. I  decided I was just gonna go up and see how he was doing, and as luck  would have it, the person who was his bailiff at that time had decided to  leave. He said,    You know, if you would like that,    and I just said,     Yes.    I did not know what all was entailed in it. I did not know what  the pay was, and that did not matter to me. I was just so proud of the fact  that here I had just gotten a degree   and my degree was in humanistic  studies, or at least that   s what they called it at that time, I guess now it   s  humanities, that was my major; my minor was sociology. I guess for me  and from my rather meager beginnings   and I   m sure it   s still true with  kids today, when you can walk in after graduation and have a job, that   s  wonderful. It doesn   t matter how old you are, (Laughs) or anything else.  8  So I thought,    Okay, this is it,    and I   m so glad I did that.  And probably had I been alone maybe with taking care of kids, I might  not have accepted it. There would have been so many other variables in  there, but knowing that I felt secure in getting the degree and where my  kids were in their life and my husband seemed to be doing okay, I  thought,    Why not?    We   ll readjust a lot of schedules if we have to,  which we had to but   particularly with the kids. They found out that  they could wash dishes and, you know, clean up their rooms without  mom even having to yell at them, and even occasionally fix dinner.  I worked in the judicial system for eight years. I went from being the  real stereotypic view of what a bailiff is, and I think most people after  seeing television and all, where the little old man would come out and  say,    All rise,    and the judge would enter and then say,    Sit down.     Well, that really had been the case until Judge Wall became judge  because his bailiff then was a female. I replaced a female, and what I  think the whole system discovered was that women tend to be able to do  a little bit more than just go in and announce the judge. They are able to  at least sit at a typewriter and do a little bit of research and learn how to  search cases.  We took it a step further because while I was in his employ, he became  presiding judge of the whole North Central District. And him moving to  that position allowed him to have what   s called an administrative  assistant. I moved into that position and we hired somebody else to do  the    mundane,    stuff of being a bailiff. That experience was wonderful  because I was in touch with many, many people. I meet people today  who   ll say,    You won   t remember me, but I remember you because I  was on jury duty and you came out and gave us the orientation and you  really worked with me because I had a difficult schedule,    and so  obviously there was something very positive for both of us there.  After being there for about eight years, I had a few attorneys come and  say to me,    How would you like to run for an office?    and I said,     You   re kidding me, right?    (Laughs) I just      No, how would you like  to run for county commissioner?    And working in the courthouse,  everybody was housed in there. The courtrooms were on the third floor,  and the first floor was where the county commissioners were, the second  floor housed the other county officers. So I knew what went on and I  knew the job description, I guess, of that particular position. And they  started in oh, I guess a year before the actual term was up, just kind of  prompting me and saying,    We   ll help you get organized. We   ll help do  whatever needs to be done.    So I talked it over with the family and they  said,    Why not?       Go for it.    So I did. I jumped in. I   d always had   I  like to call them extended family   these are people who we   ve met  9  during the years, become friends, and we would have occasionally,  every other month or so or on holidays, get-togethers. I just pulled them  all in and said,    I   m going to sit down with you and talk about this.     Now while I was in the judicial system, I had become involved in what  was called the Women   s Political Caucus, and through that I also, again,  got on the national board. So I had learned what   s involved in a  campaign and what all you need and what needs to be done and on and  on and on. So basically I just kind of followed the A-B-Cs of  campaigning from that experience of being on the local, state and  national Women   s Political Caucus. And we won that first election, not  by many votes. It was only by like twenty-five I think   my first, maybe  it was twenty-two, and of course a recount was asked for and by right  should have been. After the recount we had twenty-five so I won that  first election by twenty-five votes. I beat out an incumbent female with a  known name all throughout Oklahoma and so, I guess even there the rest  is    herstory    (Laughs)   served two terms there.  Second time around, I had opposition but it wasn   t nearly as difficult,  and of course by then I had my feet wet quite a bit. It was the year  before   it was    95 that I got inducted into the Commission Hall of  Fame. Now I was a member of   I don   t know if it was the original  Commission, because at that time, we were called the Governor   s  Advisory Council on the Status of Women. I don   t know how much  advice we gave and I sure don   t know how much advice was taken but     this even goes back to Henry Bellmon   s term   but I was very, very  faithful about going to the meetings. What we would do is like get a  project   and I remember one particular individual who is a judge and  probably is about ready to retire as a judge now, Jan Dreiling   took on  pay equity.  The issues that were most important around the time that   from school  through my service in the judiciary system and into being a  Commissioner   feminization of poverty. These are things that right now  they have so much nicer names I think for them, although the situation  may be still the same. We took on those kind of projects and we would  turn them over to the Governor. But then we learned that really if they  made it to his desk it was a miracle and so some of us became frustrated  and so I decided to get off of that. David Boren was the Governor at that  time, and I just sent a letter and said I need to put my energies into other  things. We were meeting once a month, maybe even twice a month and  that meant a trip to Oklahoma City, but there was no outcome from that.  We   d meet, we   d talk, we   d write up a paper and present it to the  Governor   s Office or however the rotation was there to get those kind of  things, and nothing after that. So I thought,    I   m just gonna kind of step  down from that.    Then there emerged another group, and this time we  10  found out that they were a little bit more serious.  Governor Walters was in by this time, and he and Angela Monson and  one other legislator, Laura Boyd who was in the House, Angela was in  the Senate   they decided that we needed a little bit more teeth with the  Commission so they changed the whole legal thing and made it the  Oklahoma Commission on the Status of Women. No money, but at least  we could organize, we could have a chair and co-chair and whatever  else, and then really just stick with issues. So I have worked with them.  Whenever there was a meeting or a roundtable discussion on a particular  subject   health care was one of my biggies   I would go to those. Well,  they asked for nominations into the Hall of Fame, and a bunch of my  friends and extended family members got together and submitted my  name, and I thought,    Well, you know, that   s great.    I don   t like talking  about myself, but they did (Laughs) so I gave them permission to go  ahead and do it, and sure enough in    95 I was elected. And the chair at  that time said to me,    Now by getting inducted, that means you   re  automatically on our advisory council and so I need you to start coming  to these meetings.    I remember saying to her,    I know there is no such  thing as a free lunch. I knew that. So I expected (Laughs) something like  this.     I think I was in an advisory capacity for maybe a year because in    96 I  received a letter from whoever was Pro Tempore at the time. Stratton  Taylor sent me a letter and said that he would like for me to serve on the  Commission and that would be for a five-year term. So I agreed and got  involved, and then I was re-appointed by Cal Hobson. This year I   m up  for re-appointment again and, of course, it would be Senator Morgan,  and I thought,    Well, I might as well keep it going now. They have  watched me age, so I hope it   s gracefully     (Laughs) I at times feel like  the grandmother of the group, but they are very gentle with me and say,     Well, yes, but with that role comes a lot of wisdom.    So I said,    Okay,  I   ll stay on and do   anyway I can to help you.    I do believe that we  learn from history and if we don   t learn, then we repeat it, you know. So  I bring up things that may be called or may look like something else  now, and yet it   s the same thing so we address it differently and go from  there with it.  Getting politically involved   when we moved into the house that we are  living in to this day, someone came around and knocked on the door and  said,    We   re having a precinct meeting, and it   s right around the corner  at my house and we would love to have you come and be part of that.    I  thought,    That   s great because this kind of gets you in right at the  ground. You find out what   s going on,    and since we   d only been  (Laughs) in Oklahoma for three years by that time, it was time to find  that out. So I went just all ears and eyes to see what was going on. Well,  11  that person turned out to be Dan Draper, and Dan Draper was Speaker of  the House. I had no clue at the time what path his future would take but I  was just so glad that I went there. So from that point on, I   d always been  a precinct officer. I was either secretary or co-chair or chair, and kind of  worked my way up that ladder. And last year they asked me to run for  county chair of Payne County Democrats, and I did, although I didn   t  have opposition, and I think it was a train running through there from the  very beginning.  It just kind of railroaded right on through, but anyway, this gives me  experience even on another level. The precinct level, you look to the  county to get you information, and the county gets things from the state,  and the state from the national. Well, at the county level, you   re like the  shepherd, (Laughs) over all of the herd here, and to kind of keep them  going in the direction they need to go. You   re part of the district and  we   re in Third District so it all becomes a great big balloon. You have to  be on first base at every level to know what   s going on, and of course  coming up this Saturday is state convention.  Four years ago, I went to the national convention because my husband  was a delegate and I went along for the ride. I am not going to run for a  national delegate this time. He is again so maybe if he gets it then I   ll go  again. The excitement at each level is overwhelming sometimes, but if  you   re    in the know    then   and the only way to be    in the know    is to  just jump in there and find out things, and so that keeps me politically  motivated and keeps me politically going. I love to sit down and talk to  people about what   s happening. I   ve done many workshops on the  legislative process, and I   ve done many workshops training people how  to run elections or how to run as a candidate, and that part I enjoy. It   s  watching other people get their feet wet and going from there.  Of course along the way in each of these roles when you say you are one  thing, like being County Commission, that did not mean just being a  County Commissioner. It had like a trail of ten other things that because  you are here, we need you here in order to bring all that back. So I think  that   s how you build up   what do you call it?   I call it friendship.  Some people call it clientele, (Laughs) I guess. Followers? But although  all these years, I   ve enjoyed sitting back and watching some of the  people who I think,    I had that person sitting in my den trying to tell  them the A-B-C   s of campaigning, and they went on and they were  successful.    So it   s nice to see that they   ve made it to the Senate or to  the House, or even as governor or as judge or   and when you get those  kind of rewards, it   s really great to know somebody else   I think of it  as,    another chick has flown the coop    (Laughs) kind of thing.  When I take something on, I become the mother of that group and I  12  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  don   t know, I guess it   s just me, but I jump into it and I put all of me  into it. I don   t just use the name for my resume or anything like that  without really doing the work because I just think,    We   ve got to.    I  hope many more people will stand on my shoulders and keep going up.  So I did the whole gamut (Laughter) instead of in bits and pieces.  From the political angle, did you ever think when you were younger or  even in high school that you would be so involved?  No, I didn   t, and I guess it   s because   in high school it   s great when  they elect you the president of the Y-Teens or the student government  kind of thing, but, you think,    Okay. Where do I go from here?    I think  the kids today are beginning to know that playing in that role or being in  that position now really does help you as you get older. For some reason  it was something I wanted to do and I had enough people tell me I could  do it. So I went on and ran with it.  I guess maybe I   ve always been   and maybe nosy is the word for it.  (Laughs) I always wanted to find out, if so-and-so said this, number one,  I want to know if it   s true and how do you prove that? So somewhere  there I   ve had this    want to know    or    wanting to know    spirit that  drives you. Now you can go to the Internet and find things out. (Laughs)  Back in my day, you had to really kind of read the newspapers and then  take that with a grain of salt because it depended on who the person was  writing the story. I did not know that it would lead to all of this. I   m  glad, but I did not   at that time anyway   foresee this type of future.  At that time when you were growing up, what did you want to be? What  did you aspire to be?  Well, I grew up in a ghetto and went to an all-black school because at  that time schools were segregated. My father and mother, neither of  which finished high school, one was third grade, the other was fifth  grade, had to just drop out and work. So what they always said   number  one was that,    You will go to school and finish school.    They were both  domestics, or my mom was. My dad was a janitor. I guess that was a  little bit more of a title. (Laughs) The next thing they said to me,       and  you will not do this type of work.    My father wrote plays and poems,  and I think my daughter inherited that from him because she   s into that.  He said,    You will either be a secretary or a school teacher.    Those were  the two positions or jobs for blacks in the day of my growing up. This  was considered in the black community that you had made it, that that  was the way to go.  And as it turned out, I ended up in the role of a secretary with a little  more classy stuff put with it, I guess. While I was going to business  13  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  school, I worked at a YMCA and I was the secretary there and went to  night school for business college. So when I say I really didn   t know  what I was going to end up being, I am truthful about that because going  to business college, you know   and I thought even then that I   d arrived,  and then of course we had to move. So it   s kind of like you start all over  again. When we were in Michigan, I did not try to seek full-time work  because the ages of my kids at that time. I did work at a hospital  eventually, and I worked a 3:00 to 11:00 shift because we didn   t have to  worry about babysitting then   or maybe on occasion we had to worry  about babysitting.  I guess I was really truly one of those who say,    Well, wherever I   m led  I guess, I   ll try it out and see if that   s the direction I   m going to go in.    It  really wasn   t until I started attending school here  at OSU  that I kind of  wondered,    What am I supposed to be when all of this is done?    And  with a degree in humanities, or human relations or whatever they   re  calling it now, I remember going to a couple of job fairs. That is where I  guess the age of enlightenment hit me because I thought,    Oh, all of  these places are looking for someone with that kind of background,     because they now have what they call their H R Department. They  wanted someone in there who could really work with people and find  them positions and I thought,    Okay.    Then when I was offered that one  job, I jumped at it because at least it gave me a chance to put my  learning experience to work. So one thing just kind of   and I guess it  just all kept rolling and rolling and rolling and voila  (Laughs)  One more question about your high school. I   d like to know the name of  it and if it still exists, if you know.  Okay. It was Booker T. Washington High School and, yes, it still exists.  Well, after Katrina, it does not exist   let   s say that, but it did up until  that time. And the high school was one of about maybe six or seven high  schools, and we had close to three-hundred people in our graduating  class. To graduate from a high school like that, at that time, we were the  cream of the crop. And, there again, the things that we did in high school  or the things that we were exposed to in high school, you know, they   re  all gone now. Our field trips involved going to listen to the symphony or  going to see an opera or going to do this with music or going to do this  with art. There was a lot of art involved in that, and I don   t think they do  that these days. As a matter of fact, I know they don   t.  But Booker Washington, as we call it, started losing the top name over  the years and   see it was very close to the projects where I lived, so it  was walking distance. Of course, in those days, you walked everywhere  or you took public transportation to get to where you needed to go. We  still had Jim Crow, so if you even got on a bus or a street car, you had to  14  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  sit behind a banner that said,    For colored only,    kind of thing. But the  high school does not exist now because Katrina took care of it and it   s  gone. Well, a lot of high schools are gone, and they   ve gradually started  rebuilding. I have a nephew who, when they went back, they had to just  go wherever there was room or they had to go someplace else in another  city or another state even. Some of the kids, particularly my nephew,  was in Texas, that   s where they went to escape. I   ll have to ask my  sister-in-law because she was a school teacher   she   s just retired from  being a school teacher   as to how many of the schools survived. I don   t  think very many of them did. But anyway, it is not there now.  You mentioned your mother and your father   were they very supportive  growing up? Did they encourage education?  Yes, they did, and they really encouraged me. See, I was part of a  second family for my father, and he would just   over and over and over  it was   you   d come home, you   d get your homework done kind of  thing, because school is important. You have got to stay in school. For  his limited amount of education, that was wonderful. And the fact that  he could at least write plays   he put plays together   and I remember  being five years old and being in one of his plays. Somehow through all  of this   he   s been deceased now for many, many years   we somehow  did not retain any of his works, but there again, I see it in my daughter   s  writings. But they were very high on us going to school   oh, yes.  (Laughs)    You   ve got to go to school if you want to do something  besides what we   re doing,    is the way they   d put it to us.  And did you have brothers and sisters?  I did. As I said, I was part of a second family, and my mother actually  had nine kids but there were only four of us that survived because at that  time health care was not available to blacks. A midwife helped my mom  when I was born and now they are kind of coming back but at that time,  that was the only way. You very rarely were allowed in hospitals so  births were always done at home. A lot of the mothers died young  because they did not, or could not, have the after-care kind of thing.  Yes, I had one sister and two brothers, a brother and sister older than me,  and one brother younger than me. The older brother has since died. The  sister that is still alive is eleven years older than I am, so she has been a  senior citizen for some time, and then my younger brother is four years  younger than me. My sister lives in Louisiana, in Baton Rouge, and my  brother lives in Dallas. They were displaced after Katrina also. They  were both in New Orleans but had to relocate and decided to relocate  where they are now and stay there.  15  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  They   re doing well. My sister was always very ill so she could never  hold down any kind of job. Her husband was in the military so he took  very good care of her, but he died at a young age leaving her with three  boys, and I must say, those three boys   they really take care of their  mom. That, somehow, was instilled in them,       you take care of your  mother.    But the other five siblings died in childbirth or just a little  beyond. I don   t think any of them made it to one year or two years old,  but they would have all been older than me so     Looking back at your time at OSU, was it difficult entering college later  in life?  Yes and no. With my husband being on campus and knowing all the     ins-and-outs    of student admission, I could bounce a lot off of him. So  he could direct me as to where I needed to go to enroll and that type of  thing. The other part, yes, because I knew walking into a class that I  probably will be looked upon like the mother in that class or the  grandmother (Laughs) to maybe some of them. Then re-arranging my  mind, I guess, to really get in on   I loved to read so that wasn   t a  problem, but that reading and then retaining it and then putting it out  there, in a test or something, that was always my most frightful  moments, although I did well. I thought,    Okay, then I can do this.     Once you get past that first semester, which   and I   m sure it   s probably  like that for kids even at their age today   it   s frightful. And here I had  three kids, you know, and a husband, and I was back in school, but you  learn to balance all of that. My study time a lot of time was just   if I just  had ten minutes someplace, I had my head in a book. I knew that   okay,  I have to be here to pick up so-and-so, this one needs to go to dance  lesson, this one needs to go to softball practice, this one needs   you  know? You just struggle through it and as you get into it, it eases up a  bit. And finding other people, other women particularly, in the same  situation really made it a lot easier for me.  Now speaking of those other women   the    Lunch Bunch      where on  campus exactly did you meet? Was it the Student Union?  Yes, over at the Student Union. Well, we just had, at that time, the  cafeteria, which is the food court now, and it was in that area. We would  always try and find a table over in one of the corners where it would be a  large enough area for us because we were coming and going. Some  could meet at 11:30 but then they   d have their next class. It was come  and go for awhile until we all started being able to really arrange our  schedules so that we could at least all be there for an hour if not an hour  and a half in some cases. It wasn   t an everyday thing because not all of  us had classes every day for certain times, but we would when we could.  16  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  What a great support system.  Exactly. Exactly.  Going back to the bailiff position you held, when I read that, I think of  the stereotypical bailiff, and from your describing it, it seems like you  did a lot more than just call the court to order. Did you ever have tough  positions where you actually had to settle the court down or any run-ins?  Or were there other people for that   security?  No, I never did. Of course, I had a running joke with the judge. I don   t  know if you   ve been to the courthouse here or not, but the bench in the  main courtroom is made of marble. It   s beautiful and it   s been retained  all these years and it was one of the first of its kind and I used to say to  him,    Okay, this is a marble bench. If anything ever happens where we  need to hide, I   m coming back there with you. Okay? We   re gonna get  right down here under this,    and we had that going. Oh, I think a time or  two, somebody tried to run down the stairs and escape, but the deputies  were always there to take care of that.  I know one experience I had was one trial we   d had for two or three  days, and everybody was tired so they wanted to finish it. We said,     Okay, let   s just stay and finish this,    and it was on a Friday, and it went  to like 3:00 a.m. in the morning. Nobody wanted to leave. We brought  food in and fed them and then we had to bring in more food and feed  them, because they just wanted to get done with that. The sheriff had  deputies that came up and made sure that all of the jurors got to their  cars and the bailiff of course is the last to leave because even after the  judge is gone, you   ve got to make sure the lights are off and this, that  and the other, and so I had extra help.  I had another bailiff who was from another courtroom come down and  help on this one because it was a big case. One of the deputies at that  time said,    Ladies, I will walk you to your cars to make sure that you get  in them okay,    and that, I think, is probably the most   I don   t know,  outlandish or whatever word we want to use there as far as that whole  time that I was in the judiciary system. Everything else was kind of cut  and dry.  I do remember though having to take   jurors had to   we had to rent a  van to take jurors out to look at some land. When I say land I say    land,     that   s all it was, was land   trying to know where the boundary started  (Laughs) and where it stopped. So that would probably go on the side of  not being too interesting (Laughs) but it was a case. We had to do that  because the persons involved wanted jurors to see the land. But, no, I  never did have any real life threatening moments or times where I really,  17  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  really   roaming around in that big    ole building   of really feeling  frightened. I knew the sheriff was there and deputies were there, and  they would marshal the halls, if they needed to. They would walk up and  down the hall, and particularly if they knew something was going on in  the courtroom. So it never got to that point, for me anyway.  You described for us how you started your entry into politics with the  County Commission. Did you have many political mentors early on?  Yes. Well, of course, saying    mentors,    I think it   s more like back to  that support group because once I worked on the judge   s campaign and  he was successful, I just felt like after that if anyone asked me to help  them, then I would do the same thing. Now I have helped a lot of people  and they   ve been successful, but at that time someone who could maybe  take me by the hand and guide me through it   I   d have to say no. That  was all done just by supporters who had that very positive attitude, too,  that,    Yes, we can do this so let   s do it,    kind of thing. There were  people I admired. There   s always been a lack, as far as numbers goes,  with females being in the political arena. That has changed considerably  now, but we still have some catching up to do. I would like to see us  have more, and at whatever level.  Who do you admire in politics?  Oh, quite a few people as a matter of fact. When President Kennedy was  killed, that kind of crushed my hope. I remember taking my daughter  who, at that time was three years old, and saying,    Let   s go in here and  say a prayer for the President. He   s been hurt,    and this was when we   d  found out that he   d been taken to a hospital. I admire the people   and  I   m gonna reach way back here and I don   t know if you even remember  from New York, Bella Abzug. Bella was part of the National Women   s  Political Caucus and came to just about all of our meetings, always with  her wonderful hats. And she always would tell us about this dream of the  Supreme Court with there being eight women dressed in purple and one  male suit. I know that was her way of giving us hope   and of course  she was a senator from New York. I   ve always had that admiration for  her.  I   m just kind of jumping all over. I guess in Oklahoma the people   Jari  Askins who is our Lieutenant Governor. I really admire her because  from whence she came   she was a judge, you know, and kind of  worked her way up that way. Angela Monson, who was in the Senate,  and her stance that she took on health care and her determination to try  and make things better. Laura Boyd who was in the House; some  females who I looked up to and called on a lot, and so I guess if I had to  say I had a mentor   because when I took on running for these offices  18  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  they were right there. They were not known as well to me then but as  they say,    You were a flickering light out there in the wilderness.     And I admire Hillary Clinton for taking on this role. I mean, it   s not easy  for a woman in any position, and you learn that quickly, too. There is  such a   oh, outdated   I don   t know what word to use to really explain  it or describe it, but there are people who figure women are still not  playing the role they   re supposed to which is to stay at home, dress up in  high heels, do the cleaning, the cooking, have dinner ready and be very  fresh.  This is a little aside, but just yesterday my husband forwarded to me an  article that somebody found from 1955 about what a real homemaker is,  and there   s the picture of the lady in her heels and a nice dress and hair   s  all done up and make-up and jewelry. They give you pointers of what to  do (Laughs) and I just really got a big kick out of it. But there are people  who still in a sense   maybe not to that extreme   but still believe you   re  not supposed to be in a leadership role. Why that   s going against God  and country to do that. So I admire anybody who can say,    Hey, I   m  qualified and so I   m going to stick my neck out there and do it.    Because  if you don   t stand up and if you don   t talk back and speak out, you   re  going to get stepped on     Now I read that you believe people who get involved in politics should  also be very involved in the community.  Oh, yes. Well, that   s politics. I mean, politics is home-grown, and I think  if somebody   s going to run for an office, then they should know  something about the people for whom they are going to be representing.  You get to know people by being in different things   not just the  chamber of commerce, although that is one group. But get into  Community Action   and maybe they call that something else now. This  is a group where, when I was County Commissioner, we had like oh, I  don   t know how many counties. In the state of Oklahoma we have  seventy-seven, but this particular   I guess now it   s called COOED,  Central Oklahoma Office of Economic Development, or something like  that, and you had people who were here as elected officials. Then you  had families, people representing the kids who were in Head Start,  people who were representing people who had low-income jobs,  working with that group and working through groups that   well,  working even through your church for that matter   depending on where  you go and what you believe.  I   m Methodist and so we are into a lot of hands-on kinds of things.  Habitat   s a big group for us. We believe in also helping others, not just  in our own community but doing mission work in Bolivia and those  19  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  kinds of things. Stillwater Domestic Violence Association, the Mission  of Hope   know about not only about what that is but who   s involved in  it. Why does it exist and how can you keep it existing, particularly if it is  helping people to pull themselves up and out of whatever situation  they   re in.  So, yes, I do. I believe truly in that, and I always believed in a balance.  Don   t just say,    Well, yeah, I know this one particular thing,    but I kept  kind of like three levels that I would stay involved in   and the local is  one. Being involved in church was another, and then extending     whatever was at the local level always had a component at the state  level, so spreading it out that way to know and learn and keep learning  about what   s going on. I   m a firm believer in it.  When you were County Commissioner, do you have any fond memories  or key memories that stand out which you would like to share with us     during your ten years?  Well, there are some fond memories, but it was a fight for me   an uphill  fight   even with my other two commissioners when I was a County  Commissioner. The way we   re set up here in Oklahoma   or in Payne  County   you have three commissioners, two that are called Road  Commissioner and one that   s called the Courthouse Commissioner. And  the reason for that is because District Two, there are no roads as such to  maintain because that   s just all right in the city, and of course the city  does that. The other two commissioners come from east and west so they  have rural roads to maintain. And I just had knock-down-drag-out fights  with my other two commissioners at the beginning because they did not  think this was fair and they wanted to change it and all of that, and it was  a learning process again.  It was learning how to work together, you know. As a board, we  represent the entire county. We forget about which district we   re from.  We all had to agree or disagree on   if we needed a piece of machinery  or if we needed this, that or the other   and I think though that was kind  of, oh, a mindset that they brought to the position. And then being a  black woman, I even had that part to overcome. You don   t want to really  cross me with that kind of thing because then I dig in my heels and I   m  ready to fight, too. And I basically just simply said,    Well, I won this  just like you did and so we   re working together.    And it took, I would  say, probably the first three years to kind of work through that.  If it wasn   t one thing, it was something else. So consequently, I got to be  the rep from the county on a lot of boards because they didn   t want to do  it. They didn   t have the time, so to speak. And any little thing that came  up that they needed   but here again, it was a great learning experience  20  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  for me because it was at a time when we were looking at converting  buildings to meet the standards of the ADA, so that fell into my lap. It  was a time when we were looking at safety, and we needed safety  directors. We needed to use a video and a booklet and go out and train  people so that we don   t have accidents. So that fell into my lap. You  know, it was like anything that they didn   t want to do fell into my lap,  but I didn   t argue. I just took it and ran with it and said,    Okay. I can do  this.    So I did.  Eventually when I ran for re-election to County Commissioner level, I  think they knew that, well, this next,    It   s either gonna make or break  her.    Of course I had opposition there (Laughs) but, yeah, I don   t like  beating my own drum but the opposition was very minimal and it was  somebody who they just said,    You do it. You run against her,    or     We   ll try to get her off there.    And of course, bless his heart, he got  beat pretty badly but (Laughs) it was a challenge. It really was, but yet  some of the good things that I can remember is the fact that I became a  role model then for a lot of kids. The kids at Head Start would come  down and visit me, even when we   d be having a meeting or so.  The developers and all   I started learning then how they get into these  subdivisions and do what they need to do and how they get all this  measured and what the county role was in that. So when I decided to  leave the County Commission and run for a House seat, they begged me  not to go. So I thought by that time that I did it. It took a long time in a  sense, but at least I was persistent and did it, and I think when they said  to me,    We understand that this higher office is calling you, but we   re  really going to miss you.    Now that was something that I wanted to  capture in print and then make it in stone and then save it, you know.  (Laughs)  Could we get that on recording? (Laughter)  But some of the other   the fondness of it was the fact that you got to  work with all the other county officers, too. You had the say-so in a  sense, the yay or nay for something they wanted to do. Even though  individually they ran their office, it was still up to the Board of County  Commissioners to okay whatever was going on. And that didn   t make  me feel like I had all this power. It just made me want to know them  more, want to know the work that went on in their offices.  Consequently, when I stood up to talk about the county then I could kind  of rattle off what it   s all about   that working together kind of thing. So  if there is any fondness, it   s that part more than anything else, for me  anyway.  Can you go into a moment up to this point within the various roles  you   ve held that you consider one of your biggest highlights? And if you  21  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  have a few, that   s okay, too. You can share those.  In the political arena or just my life and     Well why don   t you do both     Okay.      because with your experience in the political arena, I   m sure there   s  a good one there, so I don   t want to limit you. So let   s do both.  Okay. Highlights. You know, highlights for me, I think, is probably  having someone say to you that,    The work you did was amazing,    and     Here   s a thank you,    whether if that   s a card, if it   s a plaque, if it   s  getting inducted to the Hall of Fame kind of thing. The highlight that I  really look   well, there are a couple, but one   when I was County  Commissioner, and I mentioned about Action, being on the board of  Action, Inc., I chaired the regional board. That was probably the most  rewarding thing because you took people from the local level, you added  them to the region and then there was also a state and national  component to that.  This is the group that worked with low-income. It worked with Head  Start. It worked with people who all they want to do is go to work, go  home, be with their family, make their paycheck make it through the  month and then turn around and start all over again. Yet the fact that  they had a seat at the decision table meant more to them than anything,  and that somebody was there listening to them   to whatever it was they  wanted to say. If they wanted to complain, they knew by me listening to  them I would at least take that to the next place that I needed to go to try  to work through what that complaint really was about and see if we  couldn   t come to some kind of compromise.  I think the other one was, and I   m just trying to remember what the title  was, we   ve changed things around so much but   Committee on Social  Concerns, in my church. And I chaired that committee for some time.  What I did in order for them to kind of understand other people, for each  of the days where there was a month celebration on this, that or the  other, I started putting displays together. I would have one in January  for Martin Luther King, in February for Black Heritage, in April for  Native American, and in September for Hispanic. I did this for my local  church, just to help the members there. Well, word got out to some other  churches and so they then wanted me to start sharing that.  In my conference, the Oklahoma Conference of the United Methodist  Church honored me, had me put up my displays and then they gave me  22  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  an award. I don   t remember what the name at the time was, but it was  like their Human Relations Award   for doing that because it helped  bring about an understanding of the lives of other people, where they  were from. And I made poster boards. I would just get pictures out of  magazines of different people and put on there, and what it was that they  had become famous for, or the mere fact that they   d become famous  because they appeared in a magazine, and then I would add to it.  When it was Black Heritage month, I would bring out the things that I  had   my baskets from Africa, my jewelry from Africa, some of the  things that we had collected ourselves or people had given us, and the  same for the others. We have lots of Native American stuff, and I always  would fight to let people know that they were the first Americans     forget about all this other stuff about,    This land is our land.    Think  about the first Americans, and same for the Hispanic Heritage month  and March is Women   s month. So I did one on women   s history and  would bring out the women that a lot of people did not know the role  they had played. So that was that one.  And then for my work with the National Women   s Political Caucus     within that group, well, I was second vice-chair on the national board. I  also took on being the chair of the Black Caucus, made up in this whole  balloon here. We would put on educational workshops within the  timeframe of when we had a national meeting or we   d have a film  festival. You can   t assume that because somebody belongs to a group  that they know about everybody that   s a part of that group. So I just took  it on myself to educate folks and brought the group along. There was  always a time for the different caucuses to meet, and we   d take on  having something maybe on health and the effect of this, that or the  other in the black community. We would always do an educational  thing, and I think over the time they   ve given me two plaques thanking  me, and that   s how I look at that.  It   s somebody saying,    Thank you for taking this on,    not something just  to hang on the wall because I   ve run out of room with some of my stuff.  So that kind of is what I remember as being highlighted moments. And  then when I was inducted into the Hall of Fame, because I just thought,     My gosh, there are just so many women        What was going through your mind when they notified you that you were  going to be inducted?  Well see, the forms were sent out and, at that time, what they would do  is simply say,    You   re one of the finalists.    So you go with that,       and  the main thing is going to be such and such a day or evening or  whatever,    and       it   s going to be here,    but you did not know until you  23  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  got there. Now saying    one of the finalists,    you didn   t know if that was  one of five or one of ten or one of what. And this was at Central State   I  still call it Central   it   s UCO, I guess, University of Central  Oklahoma   because George Nigh had said that all of our artifacts and  things from the Hall of Fame could be housed there. So this is where we  had the induction ceremony the night before and then the next day we  had a workshop all day long on different topics that were of interest to  this group.  So I   m sitting there with my family and also then, it was a price tag  attached to it because you had to buy a ticket to go. We don   t do that  anymore, but at that time we did. I think I had like three tables because  there were just so many people who wanted to go. They didn   t care what  it cost. They wanted to be there for me, and this is where that support  group thing really pays off, and of course they did it in alphabetical  order. Well, I think there were five of us or seven of us in that year     maybe there were seven of us. My name   s Mitchell so everybody else  had been called and then it was Mitchell, and then it was Donna Nigh, so  she really was the last one.  You   re sitting there and you   re thinking,    Now wait a minute. Why  would they say you   re a finalist?    and I had no idea. I did not know how  that was structured at that time, as I said, being a finalist of three or five  or seven or ten or what? But I was chosen. When they told me they were  going to nominate me, I sort of felt the same way. I said,    Oh, gosh,  there are just so many other people there who   ve probably done so much  more than me and that   s fine if I don   t get it.    It   s kind of like with the     what Academy Awards   that say,    Being nominated is okay, too,     (Laughs) but I might say I was most delighted when they did call my  name.  Did you have presenters back then? Did someone present you?  Well, yes and no. They tried to make sure that the person or people who  had nominated you were invited, but they did it all. They didn   t have  them come up. They just pulled pieces from whatever they had sent in.  And when I found out that   I guess they sent in   you know that  many   there were different people. My dear, dear friend, Judy, took this  on and she got letters from everybody that she knew I had done  something for or whatever and sent it in. She knows how to do that.  Now I   ve learned over the years of what it takes because usually I   m one  of the commissioners who help decide the next crew that   s going to be  inducted. But it was just overwhelming because I kept saying,    I know  there are people who   ve done so much more than I have,    and when they  called my name, I just kind of melted. I said,    Oh, okay.    (Laughs)  24  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Well what does this type of honor mean to you?  Well it means that somebody has taken time to look at the things that  I   ve done or been involved with and felt that they were meaningful  enough and this is their way of saying,    This is how we   re going to say  thank you.    That   s what it means to me. It means that you don   t stop.  You continue. You do even more. It   s like this honor that I received last  month from here in the city      Outstanding Leader of the City of  Stillwater.    It says,    Thank you for all you   ve done in the past and thank  you for what we know you will do in the future,    kind of thing. It spurs  you on. It motivates you to even do more, if that   s possible. So that   s  what that means to me, and with the induction in the Hall of Fame, as I  said, I knew then that it meant getting out there and really getting  involved in not only the work of the Commission but, you know, get an  issue   and mine has always been health.  I was trying to think of how older women health and elder care, or  something like that. I held the title of the particular topical committee,  women   s health, I guess, mental and physical, and then elder care is  attached to that. You start getting into these age groups and you need to  know what   s out there to help you with some of this stuff but health has  always been one of my big issues. Well, health affects everybody and  there are so many people who do not have access to health care. They  cannot afford insurance, and you just see this day after day after day,  even in the times that we   re living in now. So that has always been one  of my main issues, and so that   s what I jumped into from that one.  With the church thing and getting an award at the conference level  meant that,    Oh, so it wasn   t just my local congregation that learned  from this. A lot of others did, too.    And that   s what that award meant to  me at that time. So anyhow, all of these just simply say to me,    We   ve  been watching, and thank you for what you   ve done and thank you for  what you will do.    So that   s kind of the way I look at it anyway.  Now you   ve mentored many folks over the years, especially in the  political arena. How do you feel that now people look at you as that role  model?  Well, yeah. (Laughs) I enjoy it and I think in a sense it   s a blessing. I  really do, that the people at the state level always call me    Miss  Bernice,    and I remember some women in my community when I was a  child that we would call    Miss so-and-so    and that meant usually that  was because they took on the leadership role in church. The people who  do this now   it   s in the political arena. I had one young woman say the  other day as she was introducing me to somebody else, she said,    Don   t  you know Miss Bernice? She   s been around forever.    I thought,    Well,  25  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  maybe not forever but         and she said,       and she knows everything,     and I thought,    Okay, if that   s how you want to spin it, that   s okay.    But,  you know, I felt overjoyed to hear her say that because I knew what she  was saying, and then to take this on and introduce me to somebody else  that way just made me feel proud to know that she felt this way.  I   ve had even some of the young women from OSU, particularly some  of the black women who have gone on, gotten their PhDs and now  working elsewhere who will call up and say,    You may not have known  this, but you were my mentor,    or    I look up to the things you did and  will in my life do some things very similar, although they may be called  something else.    So it makes you feel proud to know that you   ve carried  these women and that they do look up to you and now, as I said, they   ve  gotten their wings and they   re flying. I just hope that knowing that  perhaps they stood on my shoulders makes me proud of the shoulders I  had to stand on to get to where I am and how I admire all of the people  who did somewhere along the way kind of give me a hand up.  Would you like to mention anyone or say any words about the people  who   ve helped play an important role in your life?  Well, I guess first and foremost it   s my parents who told me that I had to  keep doing things so that I would not end up doing the things they did,  and I know that meant in the work arena. Secondly, I guess, would  probably be my husband who said to me way back when,    A man of  quality is not threatened by equality, so you do what you feel you need  to do,    and has always been there to support me in that, even to the point  where some people will, once in awhile, get into some kind of group.  He   ll go in one direction and then somebody will have the audacity to  say,    Your husband   s doing such and such, so I   m sure that   s where you  are.    (Laughs) And if he hears them, he   ll turn around and say,    Oh, no.  Let me school you about this.    (Laughter)    We each have our own  minds and we each do things separately, that we want to do. We don   t  necessarily trot along just because       Of course this was, you know, an  elderly gentleman and he just felt that, I was going to follow my  husband. It didn   t matter what   in thought, word, in deed   and we  schooled him pretty quickly.  My kids have always been very supportive, and it   s even kind of nice  once in awhile when they say,    Mom, I guess I didn   t fall far from the  tree.    And my daughter who is a single parent and has gone back to  school, gotten her degree and is now here in graduate school, and  involved in all of this, you know, and I   ll say sometimes,    I think you   re  taking on a little too much.    And she   ll say,    Mom, how can you say  that to me?    but I say,    Well, yeah. The situation   s a little bit different  here.    So having that kind of support has really meant more to me than  26  anything.  Then to have people at the Governor   s level or at the Lieutenant  Governor   s level   David Walters means the world to me. When he was  Governor, the secretary would come in   I was the Commissioner   the  secretary would come in and say,    You have a phone call from the  Governor   s Office.    I   d think,    Okay, they obviously are going to be in  Stillwater    or    They   re going to       something, something   so I pick up  the phone and I   d say,    This is Commissioner Mitchell,    and he   d say,     Commissioner Mitchell, this is Governor Walters and I need you to be  on this committee.    He did that about three times, (Laughs) and each  time he   d say,    I need you,    and you know, to have the Governor say  that to you, you know you   re going to say,    Yes,    before you even know  what it is he   s putting you on. And he   d always say,    I need more of you  so, therefore, it   s got to be you until you get me some more women  commissioners or whatever, but I need you on this one.    And then he   d  call me back and say,    I need you also on this one. Now I know I just  had you on the other one, but I need you on this one, too.    So that will  always stand out as one of the   what do you say, highest, I guess,  moments.  If you know David Walters, he   s very personable and he gets to know  you and that   s it. He looks down his list and says,    Okay, we   ve got a  woman here. We   ve got an African American here,    and you get those  two combined in one and he runs with it. And he had a saying that,    I  want to make sure that my administration looks like the people of  Oklahoma,    and he did this the whole time that he was in there. And to  this day, he   ll call me up and say,    Bernice, we need to do such and such  a thing.       Okay, well, you tell me when and where and I   ll   ,    but I feel  the same way, that I could do the same thing. I could call him and say,     Governor Walters, I need you to do this, that and the other,    and know  that he will respond in kind. But that is a highlight, especially for the  state of Oklahoma.  At the national level, I think the day that I met Bill Clinton before he  was even President will stick out in my mind. At that time he was chair  of the DNC, Democratic National Commission, and I was on the  National Women   s Political Caucus Board and we had him come in to  do a speech. He just sat down kind of like we   re sitting here talking.  There were about five or six of us on this particular committee that he  spoke to, before he talked to the larger group and it was like,    Okay. So  what   s going on in your world?    And I thought,    Here this man is   ,     can   t say that about too many others that became or are now former  Presidents. And so those are some of the highlights.  I think back about the saying,    You   re on a path and you come to a fork  in the road. Which way do you go?    So you take the path less traveled  27  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  because that means you   ve got to open up some doors there for some  other people. But I   ve been impressed with a lot of other people that are  not necessarily in the political arena. There   s Robert Henry who is now  the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals for the district. He was just named  that, I think, last month. I remember when he ran for, I think it was AG  here at the state level, that I had a coffee for him at my house, just to  have him come in there. And I met him through Angie Debo because he  is such a fan of hers.  I had Angie Debo in my house. She came up to do a couple of classes  one time that I was taking. We knew her through an entirely different  part because she and my husband were on the ACLU Board and she  would either come to Stillwater or Earl would go and pick her up and so  Angie   just sitting and listening to her, she did a lot for me. Knowing  that   as we used to call      That   s a tough old gal.    (Laughs) She would  just call it like it was and just keep on trotting. Hannah Atkins, who has  now moved away, but she played a very special role in my life because  she was someone I could look up to and strive to help fill those shoes  once she retired. She   s now living in another state, but these are my  mentors anyway, or people who I knew that I could look up to and at the  same time I could go to them and ask them things or clarify things or  just to simply say,    I   m in your presence today,    was truly a blessing for  me.  If you could give any piece of advice to fellow Oklahomans, what would  you tell them?  Wow, that   s a broad stroke there. (Laughter) To fellow Oklahomans   I  guess I don   t even know where to jump off on that because    In life in  general or in the political arena or how could we narrow the scope on  this a little bit?  All right. Let   s work on that. Probably life in general   we   re going to  focus on the political arena in a second with a similar question, but just  in general, in their daily lives.  Okay, as natives or transplanted? Because that   s kind of a two-prong,  too. I am not native so, kind of as a transplanted     Well, do you consider yourself an Oklahoman?  Well at this point, I do. I   ve lived here longer than I lived in my native  land, although there always will be people who probably never, ever  think of you as native unless you were born here. At this point, I do  because I think I   ve walked on the hot coals and I   ve gotten blisters from  trying to work with people, like working with the soil. And I suppose I  28  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  would tell them number one is to simply be yourself to begin with. And  then if you   ve figured out what you really want to do in life, then go for  it. There are going to be bumps. There are going to be hills and valleys,  but stay with it. Just persevere and   kind of like an old spiritual,    Can   t  Nobody Turn Me Round,    you know. Get on that journey and just go for  it. Stay in there and do what has to be done, but do it legally. (Laughter)  That   s the key.  That   s right. (Laughs)  Legally.  But do it legally.  Now for women who want to follow your steps in the political arena,  what would you tell them?  Well, first of all, in today   s world their burden   s a little bit lighter  because there have been those that have already been out there so  instead of having to do five miles maybe they have two and a half. It   s  always going to be a little harder for women. It doesn   t matter what  office they are running for or what they are attempting to do, simply  because for some reason the old, old, old, old saying of,    A woman   s  place   ,    won   t die off. So then you take it and you just run with it. A  woman   s place is anywhere she wants to be and you might have to step  on some hands and toes getting there, but do it. Just make sure though  you have your ducks in a row or have your    I   s dotted and T   s crossed.     It   s not fair, but make sure it   s done anyway or make sure you have the  answers to questions. And if you don   t, make sure you know where to go  to find them because people are going to throw everything they possibly  can at you, and if you   re not prepared, then you   re going to get  walloped. So I guess,    Be prepared,    which I guess is an old Boy Scout  motto   can also be a Girl Scout motto   just say,    This is what I want to  do and this is how I am going to do it. Have all those things ready for  back-up because even in today   s world, we   re still going to need it. The  fact that you have to be smarter, that   s okay because you are. You know  it. Just have your answers ready and go with the flow.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  Oh, is history going to be written? (Laughs) Probably that she tried and  gave her very best   and hopefully that was accomplished. Simple as  that.  29  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  What   s next on the agenda for you? You stay pretty busy.  Well, and that is about all for right now that I can handle. I am not going  to look at running for office. I will do everything I can to help others,  and if that means sitting down at the table with them and working out  plans for them and helping in their campaigns, then that is what I will  do. You reach a certain age where you simply think, you know, it   s time  to pass the gavel, pass the mantle, pass the whatever, you know.  (Laughs) Even pass the plate probably. (Laughter) There are so many  bright young people that are coming of age to take on some of this, and  I   m happy to help them do it.  And finally, is there anything you would like to mention that we have not  spoken about today?  Probably two o   clock in the morning I will think of something, but right  now we   ve touched on it. I am grateful   wonderfully grateful   that I  am living at a time that I am, to be able to see   because history will be  made, you know, or is being made. The fact that we have a woman  running for President, we have a black male running for President, and  we have a senior citizen, (Laughs) in a sense, running for President. So I  don   t know for sure if history will be made if the senior citizen wins. I  think we   ve had others, although I think they were younger when they  actually won, and maybe attained the age that he is while they were in  office. This is a wonderful time to be alive and to be witnessing this type  of thing. And some of the changes that I   ve seen come about has just  been marvelous to say that, if anything, I had a little part in making that  history, making that become history. And I think we   ve covered just  about everything we possibly can. I don   t remember being a baby so I  can   t give you that part of me. (Laughs) I can only start from when I did.  Well, that   s great. Thank you very much for joining us today. We do  appreciate it.  Well, I   ve thoroughly enjoyed it. As I said, I don   t usually like talking  about myself, but when we get into the way you conducted it, that   s fine.  That   s okay.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
