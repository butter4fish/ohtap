 Nykolaiszyn, with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Monday, March 14, 2011. I am in Tulsa, Oklahoma  interviewing Donna Shirley. This interview is being conducted as part of  the inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral History  Project. Donna Shirley was inducted to the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame in 2003. Thank you for joining us today.  You are quite welcome.  Well Donna, let   s begin by telling us a little bit about yourself. Let   s  start with your early life.  Well, I was born in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma. I grew up in Wynnewood. I  guess I lived the first two years of my life in Pauls Valley. Then my  father went into the Navy during World War II   kind of late in World  War II. We moved to Seal Beach, California. My mother moved us there  in the hope that if he ever got a leave she could actually get to see him. I  think she did get to see him once or twice. My sister was born in Pauls  Valley, but we took her with us to Los Angeles, Seal Beach, California  which is a suburb of Los Angeles. That was really neat. I went to a really  good preschool there. Then we moved to San Jose where my father set  up a medical practice. Then he got a call from my grandmother that she  was not doing well. She was ill and he needed to come back to  Wynnewood and take care of her, so he did, which was kind of a shame  because we lived in a really neat place in San Jose. I can still remember  it was a fairly large house with lots of fruit trees around. I would climb  the fruit trees and eat fruit.  Then I grew up the rest of my life, up until graduation from college, in  Wynnewood, Oklahoma, which is in south central Oklahoma     population 2,500. I don   t know what to say about that except that it was  an interesting experience growing up in this very tiny town, but I was  always interested in flying airplanes from the time I can remember.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  When I was fifteen, my father got me flying lessons for my fifteenth  birthday, so I went up to Pauls Valley and learned to fly, which was  really kind of neat. Later when I went to the University of Oklahoma, I  took flying lessons and got several pilots ratings at OU.  Let   s see, in Wynnewood my mother was the chairman of the Red  Cross, the Garvin County Red Cross Water Safety Program. From the  time I was ten I taught swimming to little kids and got my water safety  instructor   s rating when I was seventeen by lying about my age, because  you were supposed to be eighteen. Since then I haven   t done much  swimming. (Laughs) You do it and you get kind of tired of it. Since I  have graduated from college, I haven   t done much flying or any flying at  all because my father stopped paying for it and I couldn   t afford it. So  instead, when I ended up in California, I took up skiing and hiking,  things like that.  Well growing up in Wynnewood, outside of going to school and flying  later, when you were really small what did you do for fun?  Well, actually it was fun because such a tiny town you knew all the kids.  In those days, your parents would say goodbye in the morning and you  would go off and come back in the evening for dinner and nobody  worried about where you were. We played a lot and just did things that  kids do. We had a swing, a tree swing. There was a creek nearby that we  weren   t supposed to go into but we did; just general kid stuff. When I  was ten, I got into the band because I was really too young to be in the  band but they needed an oboe player. In those days the only people who  played oboe and bassoon were people whose parents had enough money  to afford to buy them an instrument, because the school couldn   t afford  oboes and bassoons and exotic instruments like that. So I started playing  the oboe when I was ten. But, you can   t play the oboe on the march and  so I played cymbals and then I played snare drum all the way through  high school.  I was too klutzy to play basketball so I didn   t do any sports. Basketball  was the only girls    sport that we had in school. I was in Girl Scouts. My  mother started a Girl Scout troop specifically for my sister and I. We did  a lot of church activities. I was very active in the Methodist youth  fellowship in those days. Everybody was active in their church group.  That was something that kept us pretty busy. I read a lot. I read a lot of  science fiction, and I built model airplanes and hung them from the  ceiling because I was still very air struck. What else did we do? Lots and  lots of chores and fortunately, I lived in a little town of 2,500 people and  both sets of grandparents, a great aunt and uncle, another aunt and uncle  lived within three blocks, so I spent a lot of time with my great aunt and  uncle who were my favorite. My great aunt was my favorite person in  6  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  the world, although she and I weren   t really related. She was great. We  read and I would go over there and read Collier   s magazines. She taught  me to sew and cook. I did all the normal things, plus weird things like  building airplanes.  What were your schools like? Were they large schools, small schools?  Oh no. In a town of 2,500 people, are you kidding? The high school was  150 kids, and my graduating class was forty-nine kids.  Wow.  I was the valedictorian. Whoopty do  In a class of forty-nine kids, which  wasn   t very difficult, it was a very small school. (Laughs) We had the  requisite Oklahoma stuff. We had a football team, and a band and some  of the kids played on the football team and played in the band at other  times because there just weren   t enough kids to go around. I did not take  home economics. I was the only girl not to take home economics. I took  mechanical drawing in school because I was really interested in  engineering kinds of stuff. I wasn   t interested at all in home economics.  (Laughs) I was a little weird.  Favorite subjects?  Favorite subject was actually English; excellent English teacher. We did  a lot of reading Shakespeare and things like that. I really loved it. I was  pretty good at everything except typing. I made two B   s in high school.  One was in typing and one was in algebra two. I was just absolutely a  klutz mechanically. I didn   t do too well at typing. Like I said, I got a B  in algebra two, so I ended up without a perfect 4.0 when I graduated, 3.8  something.  You can go to school anywhere, yet you decided to go to college at?  OU.  Why did you go to OU?  Ah. Good question. Well, we actually went and looked around at a  number of colleges and I wanted to go into engineering. I should  mention, when I was ten my mother took me to my uncle   s graduation  from medical school. On the program it said aeronautical engineering. I  asked my mother what that was and she said,    That   s people who build  airplanes.    I said,    That   s what I want to do.    I looked at (well, my  family looked at) MIT and Georgia Tech and places like that, but  MIT   s   I am a country girl. (Laughs) We got to MIT and it   s in a city  7  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  and it   s big and I am sort of going,    Eww, this doesn   t look very good.     Same thing with Georgia Tech, it   s in the middle of Atlanta. We ended  up with, let   s stay a little closer to home. So, I went to OU, which  worked out fine because I am sure I would have flunked out if I would  have tried to go to MIT or Georgia Tech.  In fact, I nearly flunked out the first semester of my freshman year. No,  the second semester of my freshman year, because it was really hard.  Kid from this little tiny school   like we had chemistry, but our textbook  was written in 1929. We had no lab and we didn   t have physics, we  didn   t have anything like that. The thing is that I test well, so when I  went to college and took all these entrance exams. I scored really well  just because I know how to take multiple choice exams, so they put me  in these advanced classes that I was nowhere near ready for. I was really  struggling. In fact, my parents at eight weeks into school got red cards  which means your daughter is in danger of flunking. They just went  bananas. They said,    Can we get you a tutor? What can we do?    I said  no, so I went home on Christmas vacation and I just studied and studied  and studied and studied. I ended up with a B average. I was completely  unprepared for it. In chemistry, fortunately one of my sorority sisters  was brilliant and she was my lab partner so she got me through  chemistry. That was the only thing that saved me. I got through with  good grades until my junior year. Then I got engaged. My grades went  from a 3.5 one semester to a 1.2 the next semester. (Laughter) It was  quite bad.  Well, I take it there weren   t lots of women in your classes?  Oh no. No, of course not. I almost was the only woman in any of my  classes. In fact, in the whole College of Engineering I think there were  like five or six women. In fact, one of the reasons my sorority pledged  me was because they expected me to help their grades. They were  hurting for grades at the time. I was a closet case. (Laughs) I was a year  or two years younger than everybody else because I started school when  I was five. I was a slow developer. I was a slow developer psychically  and a slow developer socially. My face didn   t work right. (Laughs) My  jaw was too big, and things like that. I had this frizzy hairdo. But one of  the women in the sorority was a pilot. She found out that I was a pilot.  She said,    We have to pledge this woman.    So they did. She turned out  to be a super good friend, and still a good friend to this day. Her name  was Gene Nora Stumbough. She lives in Boise, Idaho.  So you continued to fly throughout college?  Yes. In fact, I nearly flunked out. One of the problems I had my first  semester my freshman year was I went into my advisor   s office. He said,  8  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley     What are you doing here?    I said,    I am here to major in Aeronautical  Engineering.    He said,    Girls can   t be engineers.    I said,    Yes, they  can.    So he signed me up for sixteen hours of regular classes plus three  hours of flying. Now for flying you had to drive out to the airport.  Fortunately I had a car. Drive out to the airport, spend the time flying,  drive back and find a place to park and so on. It was a little tough. That   s  why I was having so much trouble the first semester my freshman year. I  was just overloaded. I am sure it was because this guy was trying to  flunk me out, but he didn   t succeed. (Laughs)  Well, you got engaged.  That was my junior year. Flying wise, I got my pilot   s license. I started  to learn in Pauls Valley. I wasn   t old enough to get a license by the time  I graduated from high school, so in college I got a private pilot   s license.  Then I went on and got a commercial rating, and then in Stillwater,  which is where you are working, in the summer they had a seaplane  course. I went up there and took the seaplane course. The seaplane  course is really interesting because there is a lake called Lake Carl  Blackwell near OSU, and we learned to fly in this little Piper Cub on  pontoons. A Piper Cub is a very small plane. It had these great big  pontoons, so we charged down the lake, and the only way we could get  off the water was to lean up and get one pontoon off and pop the other  pontoon off. It was pretty hairy. Anyway, so I got a seaplane rating. One  summer I went to Illinois and got a multiengine rating and then I got a  flight instructor   s rating. So I was chock full of airplane ratings.  What did you hope to do with all this great knowledge? You are quite  the pilot now, you are going though school. What   s going on?  Well, partly, originally I wanted to get my degree in aeronautical  engineering then go work for a company that built airplanes. For a while  I considered being a flight instructor, but I had two students. One of  which owned his own Piper Tripacer and I could never get him to learn  to land. I spent probably twenty hours with the guy and we would come  in and get closer and closer and I would say,    Okay mister, so and so  back on the wheel, back on the wheel, back on the wheel     He would  just freeze, driving right into the ground. After twenty hours I told him  he should get a different instructor because I obviously wasn   t going to  do him any good.  My second student was a kid that owned his own Taylorcraft, which is a  little sixty-five horse power airplane. He was actually very good. I  taught him down at a little grass field somewhere a little bit south of  here. He was really good. I was able to solo him very early, but on his  first solo flight he got off the ground and he went up and started around  9  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  and a little front came through and the wind changed directions. You  have to land into the wind, but now he was coming in with the wind  behind him. This is a very short field, and there was no way. I was down  there waving but he couldn   t see me. He came in and I thought    Oh, my  gosh. He is going to overrun the runway and crash into the trees at the  end,    and so on. He didn   t. He was really good. He put it on the ground  and stuck it there. After that, I decided I don   t think flight instructing is  really my thing.  About this time I was engaged and I was completely burned out in  engineering school. I was overloaded and I was in love. He was also  kind of burned out. He was majoring in petroleum engineering; very  smart guy. He decided he wanted to be a doctor. He was going to change  majors and go to medical school. I was going to change majors and  major in something I could get a degree in very quickly and then put him  through medical school. The thing that I could get a degree in very  quickly was professional writing. I changed my major to professional  writing and loaded up twenty-two hours a semester to get my degree  quickly. I ended up with a degree in professional writing, and then about  halfway through my junior year or maybe my senior year, I suddenly  realized what Johnny was interested in, he wanted to get married and  have kids and his fondest dream was sitting on his front porch watching  his grandchildren come in. It finally occurred to me,    Hey. I am not even  twenty-one years old yet and that   s not what I want to do with my life. I  want to do something more interesting.    So, we split up. He went off  and I think he ended up with a degree in chemistry and ended up owning  a ceramics factory somewhere in Dallas.  At any rate, that didn   t go exactly the way I had planned but just to fill in  what happened then, I graduated with this degree in professional writing  and applied for a job. I could not get a job anywhere. In fact, I only had  one job interview. This guy was a young fellow and he said,    Well, let  me take you up to my hotel room and we   ll discuss this.    We got up  there and it was clear he had other things in mind other than this job  interview. I was sort of,    Okay, no thanks,    but it turned out I got an  offer from McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis to be specification writer.  That was the only offer I got, so I ended up going off to St. Louis and  being a specification writer. In the meantime I did graduate, had a  degree, but after a year working as a specification writer, I realized what  I really wanted to be was an engineer. Went back to OU and finished the  engineering degree in a year. Then I went to work at the Jet Propulsion  Laboratory in Pasadena, California.  How did that come about?  That came about because I was at McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis. I just  10  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  hated St. Louis. World   s worst weather. Just absolutely terrible. I hope  you are not from St. Louis.  No, I am not.  World   s worst weather. It is just miserable. Cold and slushy and snowy  in the winter, and hotter than blazes and humid   you think it   s humid in  Oklahoma, it   s really humid in St. Louis. It is right at the confluence of  the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. People are very unfriendly. It is a  very clannish town. I didn   t have any friends. It was six months before I  had a date. Finally one of the secretaries invited me to be part of her  bridge group. Then all of a sudden, I was in with her social scene and  had friends, so that was better. But, when I went back to St. Louis  after  getting the aerospace engineering degree  I said,    Well, I want to be an  engineer now. I don   t want to be a spec writer.    The guy who was my  boss said,    Oh no. You are the best spec writer we   ve got. I won   t  transfer you.    Just at that time, a letter came around from the vice  president of McDonnell. It said,    I understand people are being denied  transfers, so this will cease.    So I took that letter in and gave it to the  guy.  So he transferred me to the aerospace engineering department. I worked  on Martian entry vehicles. You fly in and you come in and the front end  of the vehicle has to be blunt enough to slow you down. It   s shaped like  a short of a coolie hat with a round top. It can   t be too blunt or it won   t  be stable. It will waggle around too much. It can   t be too pointy or it  won   t slow down enough before you hit the ground, so I studied. My job  was to look at the whole entry system and process how that all works,  what shapes the blunt-sphere-cone-entry body could be. But I was still in  St. Louis. About that time I saw an ad in the paper from the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and it said,    We are looking for  aerodynamicists to work on Martian entry vehicles.    Hot dog  So I  wrote them and said,    I am very interested in this job.    They sent me a  telegram saying,    Okay, come out and interview with us.     So I was just ready, they had the reservations all made everything, and  then an airline strike happened. So they sent me a telegram saying,     Well, you can   t come because we can   t guarantee you an airline ticket.     I went down to the airport, got on stand-by, flew out to Los Angeles,  checked into the hotel they had for me already planned  in Pasadena   and called up the guy who was going to interview me and said,    I am  here, do you want to interview me?    He said,    Okay.    I had this job  interview and it was very tough. JPL  Jet Propulsion Laboratory  is very  picky about who it hires. At that time, there was a dearth of aerospace  engineers, so I had several job interviews and they were all,    Oh this is  the desk where you are going to be sitting. Here are the perks we can  11  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  give you,    and so on and so forth. JPL made me an offer, but it was the  lowest offer I had. I thought,    Gee, it is so great to be in a place like  this,    that I accepted and drove out to Pasadena in August in a little tiny  sports car, which was pretty grim over the desert. No air conditioning.  Went to work for JPL and stayed there for thirty-two years.  You had quite the career there.  Well it was interesting, yes.  I mean quite the career, and I know it   s probably too many to name, but  could you go through some of your key moments while you were working  at JPL?  Well, I started out working on this aerodynamic entry problem, and what  JPL    Well, originally I had written JPL because McDonnell aircraft  was going to propose a project to land on Mars in 1971. The project was  then called Voyager. JPL was going to be managing that project, so I  thought,    Wow, if I work for JPL, even if McDonnell doesn   t win I will  get to work on this project.    So that was the project I was working on,  studying how blunt those blunt-sphere cones could be, doing wind  tunnel tests at Langley in Virginia, and it was really pretty exciting stuff.  Then, they cancelled the project. Congress cancelled the project. This  happens all the time. I mean, it just happens all the time. Somebody had  to get laid off. I was a junior person in the group, so I got laid off.  I found a job at a tiny company in Pasadena who did aerodynamic  studies of various and sundry kinds. Went to work there, and they were  working on a project to   originally I was attracted because they said  they were going to be studying dolphins and how dolphins swam and  why dolphins can swim so fast and so on. Well, that is fluid dynamics. I  got cross wise with the owner of the company because I wouldn   t falsify  my results so that he would, they would, look good. He demoted me.  There were only ten people in the company. He demoted me to being the  proposal writer, so my job everyday was to get up and open the  Commerce Business Daily and look for a proposal and write a proposal.  The chances of a single person writing a proposal and actually winning  it are zero, which was pretty bad, but in the process, I found out about  the previous history of this company. (Laughs) I found out they basically  made a career out of cheating the government. So it went from the Army  to the Navy to the Air Force. (Laughs) Also, there was a time when he  went out with one of his sponsors and took me along and went to this  nice restaurant in Los Angeles. It became clear through the evening that  he somehow expected me to be a hook for this guy. Fortunately, this guy  was a very nice guy and didn   t try to take any advantage of it at all. I  thought this was really terrible, but when I found out he was doing this  12  falsifying travel funds and all this stuff, I went into his office and I said,     I quit.    He said,    What   s wrong?    I said,    I don   t like the way you do  business.    So he wrote me out a check and off I went.  So then I had no job, but I had friends at JPL. I called my friends and  said,    I have no job. Is there anything open at J.P.L?    Fortunately, there  was a guy who ran a group that did advanced studies looking at kind of  far out stuff. I went out for lunch with him and he said,    Well, your  background doesn   t fit this really well, but you are really smart so you  can probably do it. So, I will hire you.    So he did. I was working on this  study to look at flying from one planet to the other, and flying through  the atmosphere, like from Venus, to get to Mars to slow down to get in  the right direction. It was so boring. My office mate was working on a  project to develop an automated drug identification machine. This is in  the sixties so drugs were just starting to be this big deal, and he was  bored. He loved what I was doing, so we went to the supervisor and said,     Can we change jobs?    He said,    Can you do that?    (Laughs) We said,     Why not?    He said,    Okay.    So we changed jobs.  Next thing I worked on was this automated drug identification machine.  I got to go around to crime labs and medical labs all over the country  looking at how they analyzed urine samples, blood samples for drugs. I  finally determined there was just no way we could actually build a  machine or system that would do the job for what was affordable by  these labs. That didn   t work out too well. In the meantime, I was dating  a guy, and his roommate was in charge of mission design for the  Mariner 10 mission. Mariner Venus Mercury. So he and I got to be  friends and he said,    You know, I need a mission analyst.    I said,    I  don   t know anything about mission analysis.    He said,    Yeah, but  you   re really smart. You can pick it up.    (Laughs)  So he hired me and I went to work on this project to go to Venus and  Mercury in 1973 and 1974. The first day I went into the project, the guy  on the project who managed it, managed this part of this project, he was  mission design manger, and I said,    Well, I am a mission analyst. What  does a mission analyst do?    He said,    It is customary to define your own  job.    It turns out, what I ended up doing was going around and, the main  thing I did was talk to scientists and talk to the engineers and kind of  interlocutor between the two. The scientists always want more than the  engineers could do. I spent two years figuring out how to balance the  science requirements or the end desires versus the engineering  capabilities. I finally managed to do that. We picked the launch date.  The optimal launch date was November 3, 1973. That was my first big  accomplishment. It was a framed letter saying we have changed our  launch date to November 3, 1973. I had that on my office wall for a long  time.  13  Went all the way through the project and that all finished off. In 1974 we  got to Mercury, Venus and Mercury. Went around Mercury three times.  Let   s see, what was the next thing? Then I said,    I am really tired of  working mission operations.    It   s long, long hours. Very intense. There  was a guy who had a section (section is about a hundred people) who  was looking at non-space problems, like energy and so on. I went to him  and said,    Rhody, do you have an opening, a project opening?    He said,     Yeah, I   ve got this really neat project.    So I said,    Okay.    I turned  down the next mission analysis job which was on Voyager, which ended  up going to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, not Pluto. It is still flying.  There are two Voyagers flying all this time later. So, I said,    No I don   t  want to be on Mission Operations again. It   s just too taxing, so I will do  this energy project.    I went over and talked to the section manager and  he said,    Oh, well actually, I don   t have a project job but I have a group  supervisor job.    Well, that is a line management job, so you know you  are taking care of people. That is not what I wanted to do. I wanted to do  a project with a real output and so on. I said,    I don   t want to do that.     He said,    Well, it   s all I got.    At that point I said,    Well, okay.     Then I became the Civil Systems Group Supervisor, so we had energy,  we had medical things, we had police stuff, you name it, as long as it  wasn   t space, we had it. Well, our job was to figure out things like what  can we afford, how many people are interested in having this and so on.  Somebody said,    We need to hire an economist.    (Laughs) I said,     What   s an economist?    They said,    Go out and find one.    I had no idea  what an economist was. I squirreled around and squirreled around and  finally found a guy who had just finished his master   s degree in  economics. I got him to come in and give an interview. One of the  things, JPL is a division of Cal Tech, California Institute of Technology.  Cal Tech had this whiz bang economics department. So I said,    Would  you guys listen to a seminar by this applicant and tell me what you  think?    His seminar was on fin fish. Now fin fish are not shellfish. Fin  fish are any kind of fish that swims like that. He started giving this  lecture and I realized he had not a clue what he was talking about. It was  so embarrassing because these Cal Tech people are just brilliant. I was  going,    Oh, my gosh. What I have done?    At the end of it I ran up to the  supervisor of this group of economists and said,    Oh Charlie, I am so  sorry. I don   t know what to do. I don   t know anything about  economics.    This other guy in the group who is really a harrassable  fellow came storming up, and Charlie says,    That   s okay. She has  already apologized.    (Laughs) I said,    Look, I can   t do this. I need you  guys to help me.    So they did.  They went out and looked for people and they found two or three, four  people, economists who they thought were acceptable and their  14  standards were very high. The first guy we hired, he was from UCLA  and he came up from Los Angeles. Immediately had an allergic reaction  and his eyes swelled shut. He went back and that was it. The second  person we got was a guy who had just been in Maine. We hired him and  he came out with his family from Maine. They came out in the summer.  They had two kids, wife and two kids. When those little kids hit the  summer in California they just wilted. (Laughter) He stayed for his  whole career. He was six feet tall and had a beautiful blonde wife. The  second economist we hired was six feet tall and had a beautiful blonde  wife. I thought, I have got this down pat, this is how you hire an  economist. The third one was Katchin Terasawa, who you know was an  Asian with a little short Asian wife. So we thought,    Well, so much for  that.    So that worked out really well.  We had an economist, and then some of projects we worked on we  needed a policy analyst. We were doing a National Geothermal Program  Plan NASA  National Aeronautical Space Association  had been tasked  with. This was during the 1970s, the big energy crisis in the    70s. NASA  had been tasked with coming up with a National Energy Plan,  specifically geothermal energy, to produce lots and lots of geothermal  energy, so NASA gave it to us, JPL. Of course, the engineers plunged in  and started designing geothermal things. We said,    Wait a minute. It is  not really a technical problem. There are really a bunch of other issues.  Like what about utilities? How do utilities react to these kinds of  sporadic things that are located in areas? Geothermal is not in areas  where it is close to users, so somebody would have to make the power  and pipe it. Then in the case of using it for heat, for industry and things  like that, how are they are located? And so on.  We got into that, so I had these economists. I was the one with the  economists, so we started working on that. Then we discovered a lot of it  is really building code and things like that. They are really legal issues,  so I ended up hiring a policy analyst and a lawyer. This was the strangest  group at JPL. It was really odd. (Laughs) We worked on that for a while.  Then we got into solar energy and all other kinds of energy. Started  working with the gas company, electric companies, found out how  utilities work and so on. We still were getting stuff going with the  police, and the hospital, and somehow this group got bigger and bigger.  Finally I said,    This group is forty people. It is too big. Can we split it?     So we split the group. The section manager said,    Okay, we   ll split the  group and give half of it to somebody else and you keep the energy  part?    I said,    Okay.    So that kept growing and growing. Finally I said,     Okay, can I just give this away to somebody and go work on something  else?    So we hired somebody else to be the group supervisor. (Laughs)  At that point, I went to a friend of mine who was in charge of all of the  15  advanced projects at JPL and said    John, I really need to get back into  the space business. Okay, I have had enough of this non-space stuff. I  came here to work in space.    He said,    Well, all I have is this little  study, but it is going to be the next big JPL project. It   s Mariner: Jupiter-  Saturn.    I said,    Okay that sounds like fun.    So I took over this study  and we had about, I don   t know,  250,000 or something. We had to  design this mission. That was a lot of money in those days. We had to  design this mission to go fly by Jupiter and use the gravity assist from  Jupiter and go to Saturn. Now in Mariner 10 (it was the first gravity  assist mission) we used the gravity of Venus to turn the trajectory so it  would go to Mercury, so I knew something about that. Anyway, we did  this. We designed this mission and came out with, this is the way this  mission should work. A few years later it became the Cassini Mission,  which was two billion dollars at the time, but it wasn   t two billion  dollars when we did the study.  So, I   m working on that and I put myself back into the mission design  section. I said,    I don   t really want to be in management. I just want to  do this work, so I will put myself in a group,    which is like ten people.  So I put myself in this group, and the group supervisor was nowhere  near as senior as I was. I said,    Don   t worry about it, Ron. I will work  for you and everything will be fine.    At that point, the section manager  said,    What are doing in here in this group? I want a deputy section  manager.    So he grabbed me and brought me up to be deputy section  manager. Well that meant that he got to do all the fun stuff and I ended  up running the section, working with the marital problems, the raises and  all the parking problems, all these things that a line manager has to do.  He went off and became the mission design manager for a mission to  Venus. He left me with this section, so I said,    This is not really what I  want to do.    So I started scouting around and it turned out that another  friend of mine was running a little advanced study for the Space Station,  which in 1980 was just an idea. I said,    Gee, Al, can I help you with this  Space Station?    So I ended up working on this Space Station and then he  went off and did something else, so I ended up with the group that dealt  with the Space Station.  In the meantime, somebody else had an autonomous systems project for  the Air Force, so I worked on that for a while and found out about how  to fly robotic systems and so on. The Space Station job lasted about four  years and what we found out was nobody wanted JPL. The space station  and all the manned programs are owned by the manned centers, namely  Johnson Space Center, Kennedy Space Center and Marshall Space  Center. They were going to be in charge. Here JPL is in there trying to  tell them how to do things. They didn   t like that all. In fact, JPL is in an  odd position because it is the only NASA center that is a contractor. The  rest of them are civil service. We are working for Cal Tech, under  16  contract to NASA. We are this, as one of the Marshall guys says,    You  guys are neither fish nor fowl.    (Laughs) We were always taking flak  from these people. Finally about 1984 I just realized that this really was  not going to work out.  At that point, what did I do then? I think at that point I got back in   oh,  before then I had been the Division Manager for Energy. My job was not  to manage anything really but to be staff to the division manager for  energy issues. So, I did that for a while, and in the meantime, that was in  the    70s, because we   re still having these big energy problems in the     70s, I got married and I had my daughter. At that point, I said,    Gee I  have done enough of this. I would really like to have a good responsible  job.    I couldn   t get one, so I asked my friend who was a section  manager, I can   t remember all the details, but he finally went to the  division manager and said,    Why can   t Donna get a responsible job?     He said,    She is now fulfilled as a mother.    (Laughs) So I had to go and  say,    Look. I am not fulfilled as a mother. Yes, I like being a mother.  Motherhood is very important, but I still want to have a responsible job.     They ended up giving me a responsible job.  Anyway, that was the    80s. My boss at that time was what is called an  ALD, an Assistant Laboratory Director. He was my boss for the Space  Station Program. He said,    Well, I need somebody to run the Robotics  Technology Program, automation and robotics.    I said,    I don   t know  anything about that.    He said,    That   s okay. The people who do know  something about it don   t want that job. They just want to do Research  and Development. Would you try it?    I said,    Okay.    So I took some  classes in robotics and I read up on it and all that sort of stuff, took over  that job and ran the Robotics and Automation Program for several years.  One of the big parts of that was rovers, planetary rovers. They were  doing a lot of Mars rover sample return studies.  They were going to be   precursors to human Mars exploration. The rovers were going to go to  Mars and pick up samples, deliver them to a rocket. The rocket was  going to take off and fly back to Earth and bring the samples back to  Earth. That was going to tell us something about where to send the  people. That project with the rover and the Lander and the Earth return  vehicle and all that was ending up going to cost about  6 billion. We  were involved in studies taking a look at the whole manned program.  That was so expensive. It was about  400 billion. It was so expensive  that NASA didn   t want to tell Congress what we expected the costs to  be. So Congress said,    This is going to be way more than we can  afford.     So they cancelled all of the Mars exploration including the Mars Rover  Program, Mars Rover Sample Return. Well, I was running the rover part  of the Mars Rover Sample Return. Basically, I was out of money, so  17  Nykolaiszyn  once again, the story of my life, things are cancelled and I   m out of  money. (Laughs) But, in the meantime, the technology program was  going along and during that I got somehow all tangled up with putting  together all of the NASA centers to create a Mars Systems Engineering  Handbook, which was not easy because NASA centers don   t like to  work together, but we did that. Then we were asked to do a plan for  management training, program/project management training. We did  that and got in big trouble because the things we were suggesting that  needed to be done, the center directors and the head of NASA really  didn   t want to hear.  I went in and made a presentation at one point and these guys started  yelling at me. They yelled at me for about an hour, because I said,     Well, you need to do things like have the project managers have their  salaries not determined by the center directors, because they are going to  push work to the centers even when it   s not appropriate because the  centers don   t want to let go of their control of their resources.    They  were yelling at me and yelling at me and finally the guy who was kind of  our sponsor at headquarters said,    Well, do you not want us to go on  with this?    This was the first of three reports. The head of NASA said,     We really can   t cut you off because that would really look bad, so carry  on but just only address the training issues and so on.    So we ended up  with this namby pamby report. After this first presentation, this woman  comes up, and she was only one other woman in the place. This woman  comes up to me and says,    How can you live with being yelled at by all  those people?    I said,    I am from JPL. I   ve been yelled at by experts.     (Laughs) It   s true. When JPL does reviews, they really do reviews.  So at that point there was life returned to the Rover Program in the form  of a little tiny in-house sponsored project for  2.5 million to build a  small rover, because it was clear that nobody was going to be able to  afford a big rover, and there were some people working on technology  for small rovers. One of the managers at JPL came up with  2.5 million  to pay for developing this little rover up to a demonstration. That went  on and they said,    Well, we are going to try to carry this on now to a real  project.    They advertised for a project manager, and I applied and got  the job. My job was basically to go to headquarters and sell  the  technology people  on the idea of spending ten times as much money as  they had ever spent on a flight project, on a real project. It was clear that  unless we flew a rover, we were never going to get to fly a rover,  because nobody would ever believe they really worked. After much  travail, I finally ended up getting the resources for that and building this  little rover, which became Sojourner, which landed on Mars in 1997.  The Managing Martians book is full of that.  So Pathfinder landed on Mars in 1997?  18  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Right. Interestingly enough, the technology it used to land was this blunt  sphere cone technology that I   d worked on back in the    60s.  It all comes back around. (Laughs)  It does. It all comes back around. So anyway, we landed and the little  rover gets off and crawls around and is beloved by everybody. We set  the new record for the internet in terms of hits, there was something like  45 million hits. They say Roosevelt   s Pearl Harbor address was the  defining moment for radio, landing on the moon was the defining  moment for television and Pathfinder landing on Mars was the defining  moment for the Internet.  Pathfinder lasted for about ninety days, about three months. Even though  it was only supposed to, technically, contractually, supposed to last for a  month, I think. The rover was contractually only supposed to last for a  week, but it lived longer than the Lander did. Finally, when the Lander  died, because the rover could sleep at night, and then when the sun came  up, it could use the energy from the sun to do its thing. It had a primary  battery like a flashlight battery to run on at night. It also had little  radioactive heater units so it could stay warm at night. The Lander was  too big to have these little radioactive heater units. It would get cold  unless it had batteries that could run at night, but it had rechargeable  batteries. Well, the batteries just ran down after three months, and then it  died. The rover was so small, about the size of a microwave oven, so  small that it couldn   t communicate. It didn   t have enough power to  communicate all the way back to the earth. The rover would to talk to  the Lander; the Lander would talk to the earth. Then you could send  commands to the rover through the Lander, so when the Lander died the  rover could not be heard from. We had the rover programmed to, if she  lost contact with the earth, to go around the Lander going,    Hello?  Hello?    Finally, if she didn   t hear from us, she would get stuck on a rock  or something like that. We had this image of this little rover going  around the Lander, if she tipped too much she was programmed to stop,  just call for help, but help would never come. It was very sad.  But you must have been very proud the day it landed?  Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, I had actually turned over the management of the  rover in 1994. We started in    92 and in    94 I was kicked upstairs to  manage the whole Mars Exploration Program that is the Pathfinder,  Mars Global Surveyor and all of the following missions. The rover was  managed at that point by a guy named Jake Matijevic, who was much  better suited than I was. One way was that I was just terrible at doing the  bookkeeping. Just terrible. Jake has a PhD in math and he could do it  19  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  just like that. I would spend hours and hours trying to make the numbers  work out. It was just terrible. We couldn   t afford to have staff who  would do that so I had to do it myself. It was a very small, small group  of people. Thirty people max, at the most. I was very proud of the rover  and I was very proud of the Lander.  Mars Global Survey was successful to some extent. It was an orbiter of  Mars and just recently died. It went orbiting Mars for a long time, but  when it launched, it had a broken solar panel. It is kind of a long story,  but anyway, because of this broken solar panel it took an extra year to  get into the right orbit. That affected the two    98 missions, which failed.  In    98 we had been telling headquarters that there wasn   t enough money  for what they wanted to do and they kept sending more and more  requirements and no money. The problem was that the headquarters  managers were all scientists. They did not understand engineering. They  did not understand the engineering issues at all. They didn   t want to  understand the engineering issues.    People are just whining.    We kept  telling them disaster was going to ensue, so before the launch, I retired. I  was kind of sad to do it but I didn   t want to be associated with it, so sure  enough, both the Lander and the orbiter failed.  Then they came to their senses and put more money, because the next  two years, launches to Mars are every twenty-six months. So the next  one was 2001 and they planned to send two more, a rover and a Lander.  Finally they came to their senses and put all of their money in the orbiter  and it worked fine. It is still there, Mars Odyssey. Since then they have  had a Mars reconnaissance orbiter, which is much bigger and can see  tiny little things on the surface. It can see something the size of a person  on the surface of Mars. It is going gangbusters now. The next one in the  series just to finish up is something called Curiosity, which is a curiosity  all right. Oh, and in 2003, before the reconnaissance orbiter, there were  two much bigger rovers named Spirit and Opportunity. They are still up  there. Spirit is probably dead but Opportunity is still taking an  opportunity to go on. The next one is going to be Curiosity, which  launches next year. It is enormous. It is the size of a  small  car. It  carries kazillions of instruments and is badly cost overrun. Just billions  of dollars, I forget exactly how much. Once it went from these tiny little  modest things up to boom   After you retired from JPL, you ended up back in Oklahoma?  Right. When I was the Mars Exploration program manager, I sort of did  all of the publicity stuff for Pathfinder, which was extensive. So Norm  Haynes (who was my boss) and I ended up doing the TV and all of that  stuff so it wouldn   t bother the people actually doing the work. So, I end  up on television a lot, and spent a lot of time on CNN the whole day of  20  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  the mission, the whole day of the landing on CNN, and got a lot of  exposure. I ended up with a big speaking contract, lots of speaking  assignments. I had written a book called Managing Creativity that just  didn   t sell, so I got this agent who sent me a letter saying,    How would  like to write a book?    I said,    I did and you turned it down.    (Laughs)  She said,    Send it back.    (Laughs) I sent it back and she shopped it  around.  Nobody wanted it but one company, Broadway Books,  and they   wanted an autobiography. They said,    Okay, write this autobiography.     So I did, but they insisted I had a co-writer. It ended up that was not  entirely a really great relationship. I wanted the book to be a lot more  management and she wanted the book to be a lot much touchy feely. She  was not particularly worried about accuracy and I was very worried  about accuracy, so it was not a super comfortable relationship. We did  get it written and I got a terrific advance for it, which they will never  ever make back, poor things. It   s their business. I wrote the book, and in  the meantime I was so disgusted with the management issues on the  Mars program that I wrote this book called Managing Creativity, which  is about how to really manage. That was when I was trying to get  published and nobody was interested in it. It wasn   t really all that good,  either, but I was just so furious that I set out and wrote it in like a month.  I did that and then I did a lot of speaking.  After about a year I realized I just hated Los Angeles. My daughter had  graduated from college. She went to Scripps College for Women in  Claremont. When she graduated I thought, I don   t really have to stay  here anymore. She is going to go off to grad school somewhere else. I  got this offer from University of Oklahoma to be the Assistant Dean of  Engineering, so I said,    Fine.    So I sold the house, went back to  Oklahoma. My daughter, I just sent her an e-mail because she and her  fianc   were on a grand tour of Europe at the time. I sent them an e-mail  saying I sold the house. She was totally upset.    How could you sell our  house, the house I grew up in?    and so on. She was never going to live  there. Her fianc   sent me an email, she spent the night sobbing on the  Paris subway because I sold her house. (Laughs) I made great profit on  it, so I invested that. That did rather well. I did four years at the  University of Oklahoma doing strategic planning and also teaching. I  taught my Managing Creativity course for four years, four times a year.  Then they got their budget cut, happens to me all the time. (Laughter)  I see a trend.  A trend. The budget was cut and they just couldn   t afford to have an  assistant dean and I couldn   t afford to live on a half salary. I thought  well, if I am going to be broke I might as well be broke in Seattle, which  21  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  is where my daughter was at the time going to graduate school. So I  moved to Seattle. When I was there, this woman asked me to be on the  board of a new museum they were starting up called the Science Fiction  Museum. Then they decided they really needed a director for the  Science Fiction Museum. They asked me if I would do that. So I said,     Well okay.    I ended up doing that for ten months or so, just to get it  started, get it kicked off. Then I had some health problems. I was kind of  out of things for several years. Still did a little speaking and so on in  Seattle.  Then by good luck, my son-in-law   by that time my daughter and son-in-  law had gotten married and they had a baby, he was an investor and  he worked for Bill Gates to invest Bill   s pocket change. Didn   t work for  Microsoft but worked directly for a little group that worked directly for  Bill investing his money that went in to support the foundation, the Bill  and Melinda Gates Foundation. He and his boss had sort of agreed that it  was time for him to move on. He got this offer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to  work as the Chief Investment Officer for the George Kaiser Family  Foundation. Robert and Laura had always sworn, they are both West  Coast kids. Robert is from the Seattle area. Laura, of course, from L.A.   They would  never, never move to the middle of the country.     Oklahoma? How ridiculous  Why should we move there?    but this  offer was too good to be refused. They moved here and I said,    Hot  dog     So my partner and I moved here and bought a house, stayed in an  apartment downtown for several months and then bought this house on  Swan Lake, where we enjoy the swans.  Back in Oklahoma.  Back in Oklahoma, in a different part of Oklahoma, but it   s nice to be  back.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Well, it   s my place. I like the people. I can put up with the environment.  (Laughs) I don   t like the summers, of course. The summers are awful.  Interestingly enough, the winters never used to have snow, but the last  few years we have just been snowed in. It   s ridiculous. Fortunately  George, my partner, has lived in places like Cambridge, Massachusetts,  which have snow, so he is sort of used to it, but I am not used to it.  Seattle had some snow, but Oklahoma I expected maybe one small snow  a year. But the last two years have just been insane. The next time we  hear it is going to snow we are going to rent a four-wheel drive vehicle.  We are housebound. We have got these little cars, we can   t get out of the  house. I haven   t really found a whole lot to do. I am on the board of  advisors of the College of Engineering. People are always asking me to  22  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  give speeches and things like that, so I do that. I haven   t been terribly  busy.  You have received many awards and honors through the years, but in  2003 you were inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame.  What was going through your mind when you got the phone call?  Oh, just how neat. It was just a real honor. I didn   t know there was an  Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame. I knew there was an Oklahoma Hall  of Fame, but I had no idea there was an Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame. It was just great to be inducted and then meet the other women  who are very cool. There   s a lot of very cool women in this state that  nobody knows about. Also, I have gotten a little bit involved in politics.  I campaigned for Drew Edmondson against Jari Askins, and I  campaigned for Jari Askins against Mary Fallin. I am the kiss of death  for people who are running for office. (Laughter) I have never gotten  involved with politics before. Although it was interesting, when I went  to Seattle I went from Oklahoma, which is the reddest state in the union,  to a little precinct in Seattle that is the most liberal precinct in  Washington, maybe in the United States. It was just incredibly liberal. It  was quite a contrast.  What advice would you give to those young girls, maybe growing up in  small Oklahoma towns, maybe not, maybe growing up in the big cities  and other places in the United States, that have their eye to the sky and  want to get involved in science. What would you tell them?  I would tell them, just do what your heart tells you to do. One of the  things that I teach in my course is to follow your passion. Number one,  finding out what your passion is and number two, figuring out how to  follow it. I was teaching a class at OU for freshman women in career  planning. It was interesting. One girl in the class, at the end of the class,  they had to get up and give a final report. This girl said,    My parents  wanted me to be a doctor, so I was enrolled in premed. I just really  didn   t care for it. What I really wanted to do was major in accounting,  because my favorite thing to do is my parent   s income tax return.    I said,     Can I adopt you?    (Laughter) She was practically teary about it. She  said because her parents really wanted her to be a doctor, she didn   t  want to be a doctor, she wanted to be an accountant, which I find  strange, but she really meant it. She said,    I prayed about it.    I mean, she  was really serious and finally decided, and I think partly on the basis of  this class, to do what her heart told her to do. I thought that was just  wonderful.  I have gone through your book and there   s a chapter in there that brings  up a very good question. What do you do after you have been to Mars?  23  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Well, that   s been a difficulty. (Laughs) I have done so many things since  I left JPL. I   m involved in all sorts of volunteer activities and all sorts of,  I   ve run a Science Fiction Museum, I have been the Assistant Dean of  Engineering, I have taught engineering classes, I have been on advisory  boards.  So what   s next?  I don   t know. I haven   t found anything as intriguing. I don   t know that  there is anything more intriguing than landing on Mars for the first time.  It is really great because my grandson is nearly four and he is terrific.  My daughter finished her PhD after nine years of agony, and so now she  is trying to figure out what to do when she grows up. She is on the board  of Planned Parenthood right now, so that gives her something to do. My  son-in-law is just working so hard that he is out of the country a third of  the time, India, Australia, Ireland and places like that. George and I  started to go on cruises with some old friends of mine. We went to  Alaska last year and this year we are going on a trans-Atlantic cruise to  Europe. I have sort of decided, I put all this money away to retire on and  it would be okay to spend some of it on retirement kinds of things. I  figure, gee, in ten years I will be eighty. I don   t know how much longer  I   ll be doing things like cruises and things. I can   t really do much skiing  anymore and I can   t really do much hiking anymore. It   s kind of down  to doing old folks stuff. The thing is just to do old folks stuff that is fun  as much as possible with friends. So that is kind of what we are doing  right now.  That sounds pretty good.  I have also joined the gym. I am working out trying to get in shape. I  broke my leg and the thing to do is to not break my leg anymore, stay  healthy.  As we come to a close, is there anybody you would like to mention or  make note of that has really played a big role in your career and your  life along the way?  Interestingly enough, I had no role models whatsoever. Wonder Woman  and Mary Marvel were my two role models when I was a little kid. I  have always been the first woman to do anything that I have done. I was  the only woman in my classes. I wasn   t the first, but I was the only  woman in my classes at OU. I was the only woman in my graduate  school classes. When I got to JPL, I was the only female engineer out of  about 2,000 engineers. What I have ended up being is a role model to  everybody else, but not having a whole lot of role models myself. I have  24  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  a lot of friends, and this one woman I mentioned that got me into my  sorority because she was a pilot, we are still great friends and she was  certainly a role model for, hey, women can certainly be pilots too and  things like that. I am also a member of the Women and Technology  International Hall of Fame. There are these spectacular women in that.  Being in these women   s groups that give you role models because they  are such wonderful people and you can kind of go,    Oh, wow. These  things are really great.    So that   s good. But I think now about twenty  percent of engineering students are women. Some schools have a lot  more, up to fifty percent. Some schools, aerospace engineering  unfortunately, have fewer. Computer science has practically none. I like  being a role model. I am going to be giving a speech for the Society of  Women Engineers regional event at TU  Tulsa University  next year. I  like doing that. I like being a role model myself. That   s important. I  guess just keep doing that, helping raise my grandson. He is a great kid.  Is there anything else you would like to add that we haven   t spoken  about today?  Oh gosh, I have been talking steadily. No. I think one of things that I  have learned is being close to my family is very important. I only have  one daughter, one child. I have been following her around the country.  It   s really great because I get along really well with my son-in-law, he is  a super guy. I get along really well with my daughter. Just being able  to   like we have brunch once a month at the Summit Club. They bring  the little boy along. He brings his Transformers along, things like that,  so babysitting him and they are now thinking about having another one.  Being Grandma is very fulfilling. So you go through these stages of life  where you can   t do things you used to do, but there are other things to  do. You just have to figure out,    Okay, what can I get fulfillment out of  if I can   t keep sailing, skiing and so on?    I have found quite a few things  to be, having a partner. I haven   t had a partner in years and years. He   s  terrific. He is really helping a lot with my broken leg. He drives me  around. (Laughs) It is really nice having a companion.  Well good. We   re glad to have you back in Oklahoma, of course.  I am glad to be back in Oklahoma. Now, I hope my son-in-law is going  to stay with this job for a while. They are talking about at least five  years, so I am hoping I can talk him into staying longer than that. He is  going to go where he can get the best job. We will probably follow them  along, but I hope it is in Oklahoma. I will continue to have ties to  Oklahoma. I will continue to be on advisory boards and things like that.  Gee, I have been on the College of Engineering Advisory Board for ten  years now. It   s about time to let somebody else do it.  25  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Lastly we come to a close. I do have a question for you. What do you  think is the future of our space program?  Very good question. The thing is that the Bush Administration tried to  go way too far. The original George Bush, George the First, got up and  made this preannouncement that said,    We are going to go to the moon  and Mars, the moon and then back to Mars, with people.    It was clear it  was never in NASA   s budget to do that. NASA has a problem because  when the Apollo program happened back in the    50s and    60s, the  budget went boom  And all of these contractors went boom  There is  this huge organization that has to be fed. You try to cancel anything and  the congressmen just go berserk because of the jobs. So NASA has  become this big jobs program.  I   m very encouraged by the progress that is being made by the private  space companies. Like Elon Musk has the Falcon, and it   s now shot off a  couple of times. People are starting to have success, these small  companies, and NASA has some money going into these small  companies. They are getting investment dollars and things like that.  Before, maybe the next ten years, we are going to have private space  stuff. That is really good. That will get supported by capital funding.  NASA is such a jobs program, it is very hard to cancel anything or to  squeeze things down into what can actually be afforded. Poor NASA is  getting bombarded all the time with, you   ve got to do this, and this, and  this, and this, and this, and they just don   t have the money. So it   s a real  problem and I think there will be a transition period where they will be  transitioning to a lot more private enterprise.  In the meantime, the Chinese are going gang busters. They are going to  have a space station in a couple of years. They can spend money any  way they want, because of the kind of government they have. They  certainly have a lot of money   ours. (Laughs) I think the Chinese are  going to be and maybe the Indians, the Indians are starting to get into it,  too. They have got billions and billions of people and they are very  smart. If you think about it, if you have two billion people and you have  the top ten percent, that is 200 million very smart people. In the U.S. we  have 350 million, and the top ten percent of that is 3.5 million smart  people. On top of that, I think our biggest problem is that we are simply  not teaching, we are not educating, our kids. It is a huge problem. It is  one of the things we work real hard on at OU is trying to support OU in  getting kids to go into engineering and into the hard sciences as opposed  to history. Sorry. (Laughter)  It   s true.  26  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  Shirley  Nykolaiszyn  History is important. I mean those who don   t know it are condemned to  repeat it. It is very important. You can   t build an economy on historians.  You need to build an economy on science and technology and we don   t  have enough of it. I am very concerned about that. In the meantime, the  Chinese and Indians are educating all these people like mad and we, for  instance, can   t get graduate students. We can get graduate students, but  they are all foreigners. They can   t work on classified projects, for  example, which is where an awful lot of the money is. The military  program has far more money than NASA does. NASA has  16 billion,  let   s say, and the military has  300 billion,  400 billion, something like  that. The military can just do so much more than we can, and for  Oklahoma to be able to get a piece of the action is really hard if all we  have are Chinese and Indian graduate students. You need graduate  students to do the work so the professors can do research. It is a terrible  problem, so I worry about our economic capabilities,    our    being the  whole country, and the Space Program is just part of it. The Space  Program has to prove that it is good for something. Right now it is a jobs  program and you can   t sustain that. You can   t hold together on just  creating government jobs. You have to be able to create private jobs, so  it   s tricky. Anyway, the answer is, I don   t know. Long answer.  Well it will be interesting to see what happens.  It will be.  Again, thank you for sitting down with us today. We really appreciate it.  You are quite welcome.  Thank you.  -------  -------
