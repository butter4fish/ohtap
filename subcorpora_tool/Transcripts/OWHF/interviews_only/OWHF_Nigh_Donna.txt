Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Tuesday, June 10, 2008, and I am in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma interviewing Donna Nigh. This interview is being conducted  as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame oral  history project. Former First Lady of Oklahoma, Donna Nigh, was  inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame in 1995. Thank you  for joining us today.  Thank you very much, Juliana.  Well, let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Could you start  with where you grew up and give us a little insight into your early life?  My early life was very simple. I grew up in Oklahoma City, in the south  part of Oklahoma City, and I actually was not born here. I was born in a  small town, Morris, Oklahoma, which is by Okmulgee, but it was sort of  just a case of, you know, my mother went home to have the baby. I  never lived there. So I have always lived here in Oklahoma City. I went  to Oklahoma City public schools, graduated from Capitol Hill High  School. My father owned two or three different businesses, small  businesses   a grocery store and then later a restaurant   in downtown  Oklahoma City.  I grew up with one sibling. I have a sister who is two years older than I  that lives in Dallas. We had a very normal childhood, wonderful parents,  a great home life, very involved in our church. I loved high school   had  a wonderful high school experience. Back in the time when I was in high  school, my high school, which was Capitol Hill, dominated everything  in Oklahoma City as far as high schools were concerned because it was  the only high school in south Oklahoma City. So it was fun. It was great  fun. It was a very large high school   lots of activities, things to be  involved in. I basically was involved in lots of the clubs and things like  that, but I was in the band, and that took up a lot of my time. I played  5  saxophone and back in the days of twirlers, I was a twirler and later was  Band Queen. So band took up a great deal of my time because of all the  practices and traveling with the team and things like that.  A lot of my very close friends are the friends I went to high school with,  and that   s been a long time ago. I graduated from high school in 1951.  So those friends are still very dear to me, and I know a lot of people  when they get out of high school they go away to college and they never  come back home and they sort of lose touch with their early friends but  my early friends are still very important to me. There   s a group of us     we call ourselves    The Naughty Nine      and that group is smaller now  because we   ve lost two or three members, but we still get together once  or twice a year and have a great time.  I always worked in the summer times at my father   s restaurant. So I was  a waitress oh, from probably the time I was about 16 years old   in the  summer those years. Lucky for me, it was a restaurant that opened very  early in the morning and then closed   it was in an office building  downtown so there was no night duty, but we had a great time. Those  were the years of really a lot of dancing. We spent all of our evenings  going to places where we could dance, and at that time there were a lot  of outdoor places, teen towns, things of that nature where the high  school kids could go and we danced and we danced. And I can truthfully  say, I   m still a better dancer than any of my grandkids. (Laughs) I know  how to really dance, you know. They just sort of get out there and  wiggle, but   and my husband is a very good dancer also. So we still  dance and we love to dance.  My high school days were great days. And as far as really thinking about  what I wanted to do with my life, the only thing I really thought  seriously about was going to nursing school, but I, as many young  people do, decided at a very early age that I wanted to get married. So I  did   and it was not a successful marriage. So at a very young age, I  found myself a single mother. I had a son and I look back now and think  I still could have done what I really wanted to do, but in those days, if  you had a child, you just didn   t go off and go back to school and do  things like that. I went to what is now UCO  University of Central  Oklahoma  but at that time it was Central State Teachers College. I  really never ever thought about being a teacher, and then when  everything sort of closed in on me and I found myself having to provide  for myself and my son, I just never went back to school. If you had to  say your one big regret in life, that   s been mine. As an older adult, I  certainly have had the opportunities and did not take advantage of them.  I always found a reason not to. I was too involved, too busy, I really  didn   t need to do that   the excuses go on and on.  I was very fortunate in the workplace. I was always able to have a good  6  job to provide for my son and myself. My first really serious job was  with Southwestern Bell Telephone and I worked there for a few years,  got a lot of wonderful experience. They have a great training program so  I felt very fortunate. And one day   we had a carpool to get to work     and one day someone in the carpool said,    You know, Trans World  Airlines is coming to Oklahoma City, and they   re having interviews  today at noon,    and told me the location and I thought,    Hmm.    So  without telling anyone, on my lunch break I went over and had an  interview with Trans World Airlines and was successful in obtaining a  job. That was wonderful for me and was a great opportunity for me, so I  left the telephone company.  I had to go to California to be trained. They were bringing service to  Tulsa and Oklahoma City. In those days, you could not be, we called  them stewardesses, now they   re flight attendants   you could not be a  flight attendant if you had a child. So I was trained for reservations and  ticketing, and those were the days when all major airlines had downtown  ticket offices. All of the major airlines were located basically in the same  area downtown. We had Continental and Braniff and American and  TWA and Central Airlines. It was a great little community because we  were all right there together. I worked in the TWA ticket office which  was located in the old Skirvin Hotel.  People ask George,    Well, how did you meet Donna?    and he says,    I  met her in a hotel      without explaining of course that I was working  (Laughs) for an airline in a hotel  But that really was how we met. He  came through the office a lot, and we met that way. By then my son was  11 years old so I basically had been a single mom for about 10 years,  and really, getting married again   I knew I would someday, but it was  not at the top of my list because I had a job I loved. I was able to  provide   in those days, very well   for Mike and myself, and so I  thought if and when it happens, it   ll happen. George came into my life  and he had already been in the legislature. He had already served one  term as Lieutenant Governor and had run for governor and was defeated.  So he was out of politics when I met him and the name    George Nigh     meant nothing to me. The only thing political I   d ever done was vote.  Politics was just out of my realm of thinking.  So when I met him, he was just working at a job like all the rest of us. I  never thought about the fact that he might get back into politics. It  wouldn   t have made any difference to me   but anyway it was a  whirlwind romance. We met and six months later we were married, and  that was in 1963. Everyone kept telling me that I was marrying the  state   s most eligible bachelor because he was 36 years old and I was 30.  I could never quite figure that out because I was getting such a good deal  because at that time he basically did not have a permanent job. He did  7  not have a house. He did not have a car, and he was  100,000 in debt  from his last campaign. In those days   well, it   s still a lot of money     but it really was a lot of money back then. But somehow or another  people thought that I was getting the good deal and, of course, I really  was   as it turned out, I really was.  So he moved into my house and it wasn   t always like you wished it  could have been because after Mike and I having lived by ourselves for  11 years, Mike was very jealous of a man coming into my life because  he had always had   all he   d ever known was just the two of us. But we  worked very hard to work things out and, of course, they did. And of  course George being a 36-year-old bachelor, he immediately wanted a  family, and so a year and a half later we had our daughter named  Georgeann. I think it was sort of at that time, it was a turnaround for  Mike because when he first heard that I was going to have a baby, he  didn   t like it. He really wasn   t very nice the nine months, but the minute  she was born she was his. He literally was her third parent because he  was 13 years older than she and he absolutely adored her. He took care  of her. He said,    You never hire a babysitter unless you ask me first if  I   m gonna be available.    Of course that changed when he got his  driver   s license. (Laughs) He was so proud of her and when we went  out, he always wanted to be the one to push the stroller because he was  so proud of her. She had this big head of hair and he   d look at other  babies that were bald and he just didn   t think they were nearly like his  little sister.  As I said, George was not in politics when we got married. So when we  went on our honeymoon, we were in Israel and people say,    Well that   s  a strange place to go on a honeymoon,    but we had very little money. At  that time he was working for the International Junior Chamber of  Commerce, and Oklahoma was bidding to have the conference in  Oklahoma, so the conference that year was going to be in Israel so they  sent George to Israel to bid for Oklahoma to get it. Well, TWA was the  official airline for the Jaycees, so TWA sent me to man the booth at the  Jaycee conference. So we got a free honeymoon. (Laughs) So that   s why  we were in Israel. I   m telling you all of that because we were there when  President Kennedy was assassinated. You always remember where you  were when this happened or this happened or this happened. So I   ll  never forget how traumatic it was to be in a foreign country when your  own president was assassinated. I came back home because I had to go  to work. George stayed over there because he had to continue on to go to  do some other business.  As I said, we lived in my house. I continued to work for the airlines and  did continue to work for them until Georgeann was born. Then a few  years later, I went back and worked for them again. So I worked for  8  them for, oh about ten years overall. Well when the next election came  around, about three years later, George got the idea that he would like to  run for lieutenant governor again. He had already served one term   had  been out of office four years   and he asked me what I thought. I said I  didn   t know what to think because I had no idea what was in store for  me (Laughs) but I said,    If that   s what you really want to do,    you know,     I   ll do all I can.     Well it was indeed a learning experience to be thrown into the world of  campaigning, which is like nothing you can imagine. I look today at the  candidates, particularly the national candidates, knowing what it   s like  on a statewide basis, I cannot imagine what it would be like on a  national basis. But back in the 1960s, it was the old style of  campaigning. You literally walked the streets. You went door to door  and it wasn   t an all-media thing like it is now. So we worked very hard  and I traveled a lot. There were a lot of organized groups back then  which are not nearly as active now, like the Democratic Women   s  groups or just different groups that I would travel with and I learned to  go out on my own, not to hang onto his coattail. I just learned by doing,  things that I   d never done before, like speaking in public, and being very  out front, you know, not holding back, and trying to educate myself as to  the process and what he was asking the people of Oklahoma to allow  him to do, like what the office of lieutenant governor was all about. It  was really hard. That first campaign was really hard because trying to  juggle and never having done it before, a home life for your children,  and to be gone as much as I was gone, but my parents were very  supportive and would help me with the children.  We were successful so George was elected to his second term as  lieutenant governor, and I didn   t just want to be the wife of   I wanted to  have an agenda of my own. I learned early on to find the things that I  wanted to do and the things I was interested in and to try to have my  own life besides just follow around after him. So I did become involved  in a lot of projects, but also back then, the office of Lieutenant Governor  really didn   t have any specified duties. You sort of did what the  Governor wanted you to do, and George sort of created his own agenda  and his own image. He became very involved in tourism and industrial  development for the state, so we traveled a lot around over the state. I  don   t think there   s any town or community in Oklahoma that I haven   t  been in many times, but I can honestly say that I loved every minute of  it. Through the years, I have met and been with women who have been  wives of politicians that did not enjoy their life and were really very  miserable, and I think how horrible that would be because it   s a lifestyle  that you   re trapped into and to not be happy in it   but I really enjoyed it.  As I said earlier, it was something that I had to learn from experience. I  9  did take speech in high school but, you know, what do you learn in  speech in high school? When I was in college, I was very involved and  I   ve never been a real shy person so that wasn   t a problem for me, but  just to be comfortable in your own skin and to be able to go into any  group or any situation and   you know, sometimes they were not  friendly groups, but to be able to come out alive. (Laughs) I really just  thoroughly enjoyed everything that I did and I really tried to be a good  working companion for him. So things went along. Another election  came along, and he ran for lieutenant governor again. This was his third  term, and he believed that he should never run against someone that he  worked with as governor. If he served under a governor that was going  to run for re-election, then he wouldn   t run against him for governor. So  he really didn   t know if his opportunity would ever come along. He just  didn   t think it was right to work with somebody and then to be  undermining them and eventually then run against him. So he would not  do that, so that   s why he had not attempted to run for governor again. He  had lost that race way back.  The opportunity came along when he served under David Boren. David  was Governor and everyone assumed he was going to run for a second  term. Up until then, no one had been successful in being re-elected in  Oklahoma, but everyone assumed David was going to run for re-election.  Well at the last minute, he decided to run for Senate so that  opened the door for George then to run for governor, and it was a very  difficult race because George got into it late. Everybody else had already  declared and had already been campaigning for six months to a year, so  we got a late start. Of course he had good name recognition and had  been a good lieutenant governor because he had been everywhere.  Every community in Oklahoma that wanted him for anything, he was  there. So he had that advantage, that he had good name recognition, but  let me tell you, running for governor is a lot different than running for  lieutenant governor and it was a very, very strenuous campaign.  He had a very viable opponent who had been an OU football player and,  as we all know, those people stay very popular through the years. But  anyway, we sort of campaigned a different way. George would go one  direction over the state with a group of people. Back then we would  travel in groups, caravans as we called them, and we   d go from small  town to small town. We might hit eight towns in a day. You   d have all  these people traveling with you that would help you walk the streets,  show support for you in a meeting, put up signs along the way so we  always had pick-ups loaded with signs and things like that. So George  would go one direction. I would have my group, and I would go in  another direction, and we may not see each other for two weeks and then  we would meet up at some big rally or something that was going on. We  had a lot of crazy, crazy wonderful experiences out on those caravans.  10  As you would go through towns, then maybe two or three or four people  would join you and your caravan would become larger the longer you  were on the road.  But anyway, we were successful. He won his term as Governor in 1978.  His term began in 1979 and so there I was (Laughs) not having a clue as  to what I was going to do. But we, of course, had all of the wonderful  balls and things that happen when you   re elected, and we moved into the  Governor   s mansion. By then Mike was in college and Georgeann was  in the eighth grade. So she had grown up in the public schools and  moving to the Governor   s mansion, she thought, was the worst thing that  could possibly happen to her. I can honestly say that it is very hard on  children to be thrown into that situation. And here we were moving clear  across town from where all of her friends were, from where her school  was and we just thought, well she would go to Northeast High School  which was the closest high school to the mansion, but they informed us  no she wouldn   t go there. She would be bussed about 20 miles, and I  said,    No, she   s not going to be bussed.    I did not, and still do not,  believe in bussing.  So we opted to let her go back to her home school, but we had to go  through a lot to get permission for her to do that because we were  crossing school district lines. We   re living in the mansion in Oklahoma  City public schools   she had gone to Putnam City, which is an  independent separate school district, so we were crossing school district  boundaries. So we had to get permission for her to do that and to pay  tuition for her to go to the junior high where she was going. And I can  remember back then we paid more for her to go to high school than we  paid for her to go to OSU. (Laughs) Of course, you know, they wanted  to make it difficult because they didn   t want people to do that. But she  went back to her junior high but she hated living in the Governor   s  mansion. She was so isolated. Anyone that   s familiar with where the  mansion is located   you have no close neighbors. So it   s not like  someone   s going to drop by or you can have teenage friends that live by  that can come by and you can go hang out with.  She had to be driven to school every morning by a highway patrolman  which just embarrassed her to death. So she would make them let her out  about a half a block before she got to school (Laughs) so no one would  see a patrolman dropping her off. So it really was very difficult on her.  Then when she got home in the evenings, there were no friends close by  so it was   that distance was a problem. But anyway, everybody lived  through it and then she went on to high school, still staying in that same  school district, and her first year in high school, again was very  traumatic. She was in a car with two of her friends and got out. She was  an athlete. They had been playing in a softball game, so they took her  11  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  back to her car   she was now driving   they went on up the street a  block, hit a telephone pole and they were both killed.  Oh my goodness.  So her sophomore year in high school was just sort of a blackout  because it took a long time for her to get over that experience   but  anyway, we all survived. She became more used to it and as she  matured, she realized what an opportunity she had living where she was  living and the things she was able to do that other kids weren   t able to do  and the people she was able to meet. Anyway, she just matured enough  to know that it was okay and then when she got wheels that made a  difference, too. (Laughs) But it still was a little awkward about the boy-girl  situation. Boys didn   t really want to have to come to the Governor   s  Mansion to pick up their date, to have to go through guards at the gate  and   you know, it   s very intimidating.  But I think I can honestly say that probably college is really when she  blossomed, when she matured, because she got away from us. And by  then, George had run for the second term as Governor and was  successful. So she was in the eighth grade when he became Governor.  She was in her last semester of college when he left office. So you can  basically say all of her teenage, young adult, years her father was  Governor but she went to OSU. She loved it, and joined a sorority. That  was good for her because her brother was enough older than she that he  had been gone from home a long time. So she really was raised almost  as an only child. So having the sorority and the closeness of the girls in  the sorority house was really good for her. She had a wonderful  experience in college, and our son also went to OSU. So I   m a big fan of  OSU, even though George and I neither one went there, our children did  and most of our grandchildren. We still have a couple that aren   t in  college yet.  I   ll sort of now have to regress to tell you about the things that I was  involved in and the things that I enjoyed doing. During the period of  time when George was Lieutenant Governor, the Governor at that time  was Dewey Bartlett, and he had requested that George make a tour of all  state facilities. That being all colleges and universities, the prisons, state  mental institution, the state mentally retarded institutions, anything that  the state operated. So this took a year, and I went with George on most  of these trips, and it was a very eye-opening experience to see these  various institutions. When we went on campuses, that was during the  time of a lot of student unrest, and so that was really an experience.  The thing that made the biggest impact on me   at that time, Oklahoma  had three   they were called    state schools for the mentally retarded.     12  They were located in Pauls Valley and Enid and Sand Springs, and when  we visited those three state schools, I was just   those people that were  living there made such an impression on me. It was all new to me. I   d  never been around anyone that was mentally challenged like that. You  know, back when I was in high school, I really didn   t have, to my  knowledge, anyone in my school that was mentally challenged like that  because people didn   t send them to public schools. So this was all new  to me, and I saw so many people living there that I didn   t feel like  needed to be living there. They were more socially retarded than  mentally retarded because they had been placed there when they were  infants.  We   re now so accustomed to all the sophisticated testing that you can  put a child through. Back then, none of that testing was available. So  you had a child that something was wrong and you didn   t know what  was wrong, and the doctors didn   t necessarily know what was wrong.  And they would recommend,    I think it would be better if you would  just put this child in an institution.    You know, maybe that child was  autistic. Maybe they just had dyslexia. Maybe they were deaf and no one  even realized they were deaf. Anyway, so many of these people were put  there as babies and left for the rest of their lives and they were not  mentally retarded. Some of them were mildly retarded, but certainly  could function in the outside world if given the opportunity.  So I just almost became obsessed with their problems and trying to  figure out what I could do to make a difference. I really wanted to be  their spokesperson because I felt like they didn   t have one   not that the  schools were not taking good care of them, but there was just so many  that didn   t need to be there I thought. So when George was elected  Governor, I felt like that was my opportunity to help these people  because to be honest, it   s a lot easier to get things done if your husband   s  governor than if he   s not governor. So I wanted to seize the moment and  to see if I could make something happen.  So I had found out that most states had what they called group homes.  Oklahoma had none, and so I decided that that would be what I would  start working on. So I approached George with it, and George was like  so many other people that don   t understand mental retardation   of  course he does now, he   s now educated himself, but back then   people  confused mental illness with mental retardation, and it   s not the same.  Mental illness is a disease. Mental retardation is a condition, and there   s  no cure for it. So many people were fearful of people that were mentally  challenged, just simply because they didn   t know how to respond to  them, to interact with them. But anyway, when I approached George that  I would like to start a program in Oklahoma of group homes, he said,    I  will put the money in my budget, but it   s up to you to lobby the  13  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  legislature to approve it.    Well it was at that time that I got a new  appreciation for trying to get anything passed through the (Laughs)  legislature. Really I think the only reason I was successful is they just  voted for it to get me off their back and to shut up. I don   t really think  they had a clue as to what they were voting for, (Laughter) but they  thought,    Well, it   s the Governor   s wife,    you know,    We may need her  help on something else, so let   s        Who ended up carrying the legislation?  You know, I don   t remember. There was a legislator in Tahlequah, I  remember, but he   s been gone for a long time and I   m sorry I don   t  remember the name. But they allotted me enough money for a pilot  program. Well we thought that we had enough money to start ten group  homes, but as it turned out we had enough money that we were able to  start a few more than ten   I don   t remember the exact number, but it  was more than ten. It was a very long tedious process because it involves  so much. First of all, people didn   t want them in their neighborhoods.  Every place where we would decide we wanted to place one, we would  have to appear before the city councils, the zoning commission   we   d  have to go through all that. Every home, you know, you would have to  go through the fire marshal, the health department. It was really much  more involved than what I anticipated it would be, but we hung in there.  I had a lot of support from the people at the Department of Human  Services because this all came through them. Now the state did not own  the group homes themselves   the buildings   because the state couldn   t  own property like that. So what we would have to do would be to find a  support group, say a group of parents or a church group or a civic group  that would own the property, and then the state would provide  everything else in that home for these residents. So, now these had to be  mildly retarded adults. So they had to be over the age of 18. They had to  be medication-free. They had to be able to work some type of work. We  didn   t want them just sitting in a house watching TV all day. So then  when you get into the work problem that was the time before people  were educated in hiring the handicapped. We really had difficulty in  finding jobs for them. So then that meant creating the sheltered  workshops which are all around Oklahoma. This was a controlled  environment where these people could go every day, just like they   re  going to a job, and these workshops would obtain contracts from outside  businesses to bring work in to the workshops so the people could work.  They got paid for their work. They contributed to the group home where  they lived, depending on how much money they made, they had to pay a  certain amount of that. Many of them became taxpayers.  As time went on, as people became educated in the workforce, a lot of  14  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  them were able to get jobs, for instance at OSU in the colleges, in hotels,  in nursing homes, in greenhouses, McDonalds, Target   they now are  employing these people. So up until that time, if someone left a state  home they went to a nursing home. Well, they weren   t old, number one,  and they weren   t sick. That was no place for them to live, and it would  break my heart to go to these nursing homes and see a 25-year-old  young man or woman just wandering around with nothing to do, no one  their own age to     Interact with?     interact with. My goal was to try to get those that could leave the  nursing homes. Now some of them had health conditions that prevented  them from living in a group home, but my goal was to get those people  out of those nursing homes. A group home basically was for     depending on the size of the house   from six to ten people. It could be  all boys or all girls, or we had some homes where both would be living,  with a house parent   24-hour-a-day house parents. They had their own  room or they shared a room with someone. They could have their own     you know they could decorate the room like they wanted to. This was  the first time many of them had ever lived in a home-like setting. They  learned to cook. They prepared their meals. They kept their house clean.  Finally, after lots of meetings, several years passing, the neighborhoods  became very accepting of them because they were wonderful neighbors.  They took such pride in their home. They kept their lawn mowed. They  planted gardens. They planted flowers. If there were elderly people  living on the street, they would help take care of them. And, you know,  they didn   t have their drivers license so there weren   t ten cars parked in  the yards and out on the streets, and they became very good neighbors.  There for years, I went to every group home opening that we had, and  they were really springing up across the state. So we started with an  allotment for ten and we now have over 100 in the state. If I had to say  the one thing I was most proud of, it would be the impact we   ve been  able to make on the lives of the mentally challenged.  Of course all the federal laws have changed since then. Now, a lot of the  state schools have been closed or downsized, and more and more  children are living at home now or are living in apartments with other  mentally challenged people and then they have caseworkers that take  care of them. Through the years, a lot of things have changed. But the  problem I see now is the federal government has mandated all of this for  the public schools.    You must do this and you must do this and you must  do this,    and they provide no money for it. Well there   s probably not a  school district around that has all the money they need, so the money for  the mentally challenged, the special classes in school, the special  15  equipment that is required to teach these children is not there. So now  the problems we face are making sure that we help the school districts in  helping these young people be all they can be.  I just still don   t feel like things can be right for the rest of us until it   s  right for everybody. They have all of the dreams that we have. They  have all of the desires that we have. They have all of the rights that we  have, and we should not be satisfied until they   re able to accomplish all  that they can. They have limitations, but to take them to that point that  they have accomplished all that they can   and I think I can truthfully  say, next to my family and my church, these people are the closest to my  heart. I   m still involved with a lot of them and a lot of the different  groups.  Another group of special needs children that George and I kind of  focused on when we were living in the Governor   s Mansion   we started  an annual Easter Egg Hunt for the blind children. Well you say,    an  Easter Egg Hunt for the blind,    and people just give you a look like, you  know,    You   ve lost it,    but it was wonderful. We got a teacher in the  Oklahoma City public schools that taught these children to help us  because we didn   t know how to go about this and so she advised us. We  invited every blind child. We sent out notices to all the school districts if  they had blind children. We notified the School for the Blind which is  located in Muskogee. We went through every institution or school  district that we could think of making sure that all of the blind children  knew about this. We had school buses lined up over there like you  wouldn   t believe.  The way we handled it   back then, AT T was a big industry in  Oklahoma City, and their retired employees had a group called the  Pioneers. So we got the Pioneers of AT T involved, and I   m sure a lot  of   you may not remember, but back then there were pantyhose that  came in big plastic eggs   the pantyhose were called Leggs. We gathered  up these big plastic eggs, and the Pioneers from AT T installed beepers  in these eggs so the children hunted the eggs by the sound. We   d  activate a switch on the outside. The teacher advised us that every  student should be blindfolded. Well I was just astonished. I just thought,     You can   t do that. You can   t blindfold a blind child,    and she said,     Oh, yes. They   ll think it   s funny,    and she said,    There are various  degrees of sight, and so to be fair for everybody, you blindfold  everybody.    Well it just broke my heart, but we did it. We blindfolded  everybody, and we divided them into age groups as far as hunting the  eggs were concerned, but every child had someone to accompany them,  to help them.  We made sure that every kid found dozens of eggs, and we had all sorts  16  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  of mascots there in their costumes. We had all sorts of live animals for  them to be able to pet. Oh, it was just fabulous. We had Easter bunnies,  baby chickens, baby pigs   we just had everything there for them, but  every child left there that day loaded with goodies. The Oklahoma  Grocers Association provided us with all this stuff to put in baskets, so  every child had a huge Easter basket and oh, just all sorts of things that  we got donated from people. It was the most gratifying thing and  wonderful thing to watch. So we did that every year that we lived in the  mansion. It was discontinued when we left, but I just have a special  place in my heart for people with special needs   and still do.  When it was getting close to the time that George was going to leave  office, a group of my friends, as a gift to me, started the Donna Nigh  Foundation. You know, most foundations are started because people  have an abundance of money. This certainly was not the case. It was just  started by a small group of people with small donations, and so when  you think of foundations, we   re very small but we are the only  foundation in the state that is specifically for the developmentally  disabled. You know,    mentally retarded    is no longer politically correct.  I still use that term a lot because that   s what I   ve always   but it   s     developmentally disabled      and so we   re the only foundation that is  specifically for that. So we   re still in operation, and it will be in  operation long after I   m gone because of the way we   ve set it up.  And that was announced at one of your birthday parties?  You know, I think it was my 50th.  Pretty good gift.  Pretty good gift. The specifications were that any money had to go to  either individuals or groups that were developmentally disabled. Now  basically the people that apply to us for aid are people who cannot get  help from the federal government or from the state government, so  they   ve sort of fallen through the cracks.  Now most of the people that request aid from us are families that are  attempting to care for their loved ones at home. They may need their  bathroom renovated to be able to handle a wheelchair or maybe a lift for  a bathtub or things of that kind, or maybe they need special equipment,  special computers that the child can use, maybe with a head wand     things of that type. And then we also get requests from special-ed classes  in public schools to help with a particular child or maybe a piece of  equipment that will help more than one child. Most of our requests come  through caseworkers. They are involved with these families and they see  a need and know that the family is not able to provide for this. So that   s  17  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  where most of our requests come from.  About three years ago, we gave  50,000 to the Tulsa public schools and   50,000 to the Oklahoma City public schools to make sure their  facilities were up to code on the ADA   that they had automatic door  openers, that their bathrooms would accommodate the handicapped, that  they had railings down the hallway and things like that. So, like I say, in  terms of foundations, we   re small but we   re still able to help a lot of  people. Contributions that are made to us, our bylaw specified that 50  percent goes into the endowment and then 50 percent can be used. So  we   re still out there trying to help and trying to make a difference.  Well something else you did during your years as First Lady   you were  one of the first to open up the mansion to the public.  Yes, and that was fun. It had been opened just sporadically. A First  Lady would do it maybe two or three times a year or something like that,  but I really felt like I was living there but the house really belonged to  the people of the state and they should have that right to come in and see  it. So we had open house every Wednesday, 52 weeks of the year, and it  was wonderful the way people responded. I went to various groups of  women   clubs, church groups, whatever   and invited anyone that  would be interested to be a guide. So we had guides that would take  people through, and the one thing that was different about our open  house, the entire house was open. Before, they had only allowed the first  floor to be opened. Well you don   t really see the house, or see how  they   re living with just the first floor. For people that have been there,  the first floor is basically just about four rooms.  We opened up the whole house, which meant you had to throw  everything in the closet that day and shut the door and (Laughs) make it  presentable. Georgeann hated Wednesdays because she couldn   t come  home until open house was over, or if she came home, she had to go  hide out somewhere, maybe in the kitchen because the kitchen wasn   t on  the tour. But we had thousands that came through the mansion and we  always had special open houses, of course, for the Christmas holidays so  people could see the mansion decorated. It was really fun to explain the  history of the house to people and where certain items of furniture or  whatever, where they came from. People loved it.  I thought it was a problem at the time, but as I look back it was just part  of people   s lives. There would not be a Wednesday go by but what when  George and I got ready to go to bed there would be notes under our  pillow on our bed. People would sneak when the guide wasn   t looking,  they would put a note, and it was usually something they wanted George  to do or something he did they didn   t like or    My son is in prison and  18  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  he   s really innocent. His number is so-so, xxxx. Would you please  do         you know, that type of thing. But there again, it was just people  that needed help and that was the only way they knew how to ask. It was  really strange. People would ask what side of the bed we slept on, and  the majority of the notes were left under my pillow because I think  people realized a woman can influence a man. (Laughter) So it was just  great to be able to share that home because it   s a wonderful home. It   s  not a mansion. It   s just a large older home and it   s got a lot of rich  history. Now since we lived there, of course it   s been totally re-done and  it   s fabulous now the way it   s decorated and the furnishings. It wasn   t  that nice when we lived there, but we thought it was wonderful.  Did you have a lot of say-so in how the d  cor looked?  Yes, we did. It   s not that way now because they have established a board  that governs what is there and everything in that house now is on the  computer, as it should be, so there   s never any question about what  belongs to whom. When we lived there   when we moved in, I   d say it  was just about half furnished, so we had to bring a lot of our own  personal furniture in, but that   s not the way it is now. Everything that   s  there belongs to the state and they keep track of it, they have a governing  board. What is now called Friends of the Mansion sort of supplies   we  have various fundraisers   supplies added money to do things there that  the state can   t do. The wonderful pavilion that   s there now where large  groups of people can meet was the result of fundraising to do things that  the state doesn   t have the money to do. Years ago there was a lot of talk  about tearing it down or moving the mansion to another part of town and  I feel like it   s right where it should be. It   s close to the Capitol and it   s  beautiful.  One more thing I   d like to cover with you before you leave us today   I  read back in 1984 you were at the Democratic National Convention and  you had a striking resemblance to somebody.  Yes, that was fun.  Geraldine Ferraro. (Laughs)  And you know I look back at those pictures now, and we really did look  alike. We were about the same age. We wore our hair the same way. We  were about the same size. Anyway, there was really a striking  resemblance, and the Democratic Convention was held in San Francisco.  The first really big thing I can remember was there was a luncheon just  for women and there were literally   oh, I started to say thousands, but  there wouldn   t have been thousands, but maybe a thousand women at  this luncheon   and it   s when Jimmy Carter was President. Rosalynn  19  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nykolaiszyn  Carter was presiding at this luncheon. Well I arrive at the luncheon     and of course anytime you have security guards with you, people think,     Oh, she   s somebody special.    But I came in one door kind of at the  back of the room and Mrs. Carter was up here at the front, and she said,     Ladies, Geraldine Ferraro, the candidate for Vice President of the  United States.    Everybody stood and applauded, and oh, I didn   t know  what to do. I was doing this and I was embarrassed because I thought,     She   s going to be embarrassed when she realizes.     It   s when the Olympics were being held in Los Angeles, so we went  from San Francisco to Los Angeles to attend the Olympics. Going in to  the Olympic grounds, of course we had Los Angeles police, we had all  this entourage, and we were on the grounds of the Olympics and George  and I get out of the car and suddenly people say,    It   s Geraldine. It   s  Geraldine.    Well, I mean, I was just mobbed and George just sort of  stood back. I loved it because he wasn   t getting any attention, but  everybody was shoving programs at me wanting me to   well I started  out saying, you know,    I   m sorry I   m not who you think I am     explaining, and it just got to be too overwhelming so I just started  signing her name. I just thought I can   t explain it to everybody. They   ll  never believe me, and so,    Geraldine, if you   re out there anywhere,  believe me I did not    (Laughs) I did not mean anything,    but I didn   t  know how else to handle the situation. But lots of times our pictures  were printed side by side so people could see the resemblance. I haven   t  seen a picture of her recently, or in many years, so I don   t know if we  still resemble each other or not, but it was a fun thing in history.  That   s good PR, too. I mean, she   s in two places at one time.  Right, right. (Laughter)    I saw her     No, you didn   t see her because I  saw her.  Well I think I   m going to stop right here. I would like to thank you for  coming out today and sharing your story with us.  Oh, it   s my pleasure. But I would like to be able to talk about some  experiences after we left.  That would be great   --- End of June 10, 2008 Interview ---  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Tuesday, July 29, 2008. This interview is being  conducted as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame oral history project. Today we   re here with Donna Nigh for the  20  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  second half of our interview. We   re so happy that you could join us one  more time.  Thank you.  Well let   s begin by picking up a little bit where we left off. Take me  through the last few months of your time in office as First Lady.  It   s a very difficult time because you suddenly realize that you don   t  have a house. You don   t have a car. You don   t have any furniture.  (Laughs) You don   t know where you   re going to live. It   s kind of like  you   ve been living in public housing all these years and so you have a  lot to do. You have to make the decisions about where you   re going to  live. George made a promise, I think more to himself than anyone, that  he would not accept a job offer from anyone while he was in office  because he didn   t want to appear that he was giving anyone any special  favors. So when he left office, he did not have a job. So by then, of  course, our children were gone, either out of college or in college. You  still have to go about your daily duties because you   re still in office. You  still have the things that you have to do, but at the same time making  preparation for the life after   and it   s very exciting.  I   ve often said that I thought the perfect thing would be one term that  was six years long instead of four-year terms. Of course now most  governors, once they   ve been in for four years they run for the second  term. George was the first one to succeed himself   but eight years is  just a little long. It was for me. I don   t know that everyone feels that  way. You   re getting a little weary and you   re ready to have your own  life. You   re ready to be your own boss, to decide where you will go that  day and what you will do and there   s not someone dictating every move  that you make. At the same time, it was a very sad time because it had  been a wonderful period of our life and one that I virtually loved. I loved  what I did. I loved what was expected of me. I loved the people that we  got to be around, all the activities   so it was a very melancholy time,  but at the same time exciting because you were moving on to the next  stage in your life.  So we made the decision that we would stay in Oklahoma City, and of  course George had no desire to go to Washington so there was no  political race in the future. He said that all along, but you know most  politicians do say that, you know      I   m not interested in any other  job      but he really meant it. He had no interest in anything outside of  Oklahoma. So we knew that his political life was over. So he was asked  to do several things and decided on going to the University of Central  Oklahoma   at that time, that was to teach.  So we got all settled, but it   s a very unusual feeling because when  21  you   ve been doing something for eight years, a lot has happened during  those eight years. For instance, we had never run our car through a car  wash. So one night we loaded up with quarters, knowing we probably  would mess up, and we went at midnight so no one would see us or  recognize us (Laughs) and know that we didn   t know how to run our car  through a car wash. So it was just little things like that. We were not  used to carrying keys because somebody was always with us. We  weren   t used to carrying money. I can   t tell you the number of times we  locked ourselves out of our house or out of our car, or we   d get  someplace and wouldn   t have any money or any credit cards with us.  And of course George had not driven a car for about   because he had a  driver part of the time when he was Lieutenant Governor so he really  had not driven for about 12 or 16 years   so that was an experience. I  probably had driven more than he had because I would sneak off and  drive myself places, but of course there was no way he could do that.  So it was just learning how to do a lot of things that people take for  granted, and it wasn   t that we couldn   t do it or wouldn   t do it, it   s that  they would not allow you to do it. And of course keeping my own house,  cooking all the meals   but anyway, it was a great   we had a lot of  laughs at each other and we settled into a routine just like everybody  else. We stayed in Oklahoma City for awhile and then we decided since  he was going to be in Edmond that we would move to Edmond. So we  moved to Edmond and then a few years later he was named President of  the University of Central Oklahoma, UCO. What was so great to me  about that was I had attended school there. You think never in your  wildest imagination did you ever expect to come back to your alma  mater as the wife of the president.  There were a lot of things about that job that sort of reminded me of  being in politics. You still had all the things you had to do, all the places  you had to be, dealing with the legislature because it   s very political, the  funds that you get and all that. It was a little easier on George, having  been there, he knew how to do it. But it was wonderful being around  young people. They just brought a whole new vitality to your life and  watching them advance through the years in their studies and all the  wonderful activities that take place. It just makes you feel young again.  So the experience at UCO was really great.  When the Regents hired him, they hired him to basically rebuild the  campus and to rebuild the image of the school in the public   s eye. It was  not very good. Other than having taught in high school, he was not an  academician and he didn   t try to be. He let the vice presidents, the  people, run the areas that they were to run, but his job basically was to  rebuild the campus, which he did. He told them when they hired him     he was the oldest person to ever be hired as president of the university     22  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  but he told them that he would stay at least three years and a maximum  of five years, so he stayed the five years, but he said later, in looking  back, he really wished he had stayed a couple of years longer because a  few of the projects were not completed when he left. But for anyone that  knows the old UCO and then to see the present UCO, it   s just  wonderful   the transition that   s been made and the campus is just  wonderful.  He developed, while he was there, an idea he had of getting bond money  to build things. Now bond money was not new, but bond money  normally came if you were going to build something that brought in  revenue. So to get bond money for something that was not going to  bring in revenue was something new. So he went to the legislature and  got approval to do that. So that   s how they were able to build so much  there. Since then   there   s probably not a campus in Oklahoma that has  not adopted   they call it the    Nigh Program      a way of funding  buildings and then a way of paying the money back.  Well what were some of the issues you championed as First Lady, but  now of a college   a university?  Well I started an art gallery at UCO and it   s still there and has been  improved upon since we were there. It   s just like any art gallery. They  have showings of various artists, and lots of times they have showings of  faculty and students. It   s a very popular place on campus, and it   s a very  nice art gallery. So that was the main thing I focused on. I still was  involved in the School of Education and getting programs started for  their teachers that were going to be dealing with the developmentally  disabled   getting certain programs in the Department of Education. So  that was about it.  That seems like a lot just getting it going. Now art   s always been very  important for you even during your time in Oklahoma City. I read that  you   re a big supporter of the arts and you encouraged local art in the  Capitol from civic organizations and clubs throughout Oklahoma. Why  is art so important?  I just really feel like art is a very important part of our lives and a very  important part of education in making sure that it is offered to everyone  and let them experience. We started the Artist in Residence programs  where these very well-known, established artists   whether they be a  storyteller or a sculptor or whatever their medium might be   their job is  to go around the public schools and to be available to demonstrate and to  help the teachers, have workshops for the teachers, to help them develop  programs in getting the children more interested and more involved in  the arts. Everybody can   t be an athlete. Everybody can   t be a 4.0  23  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  student. We just need to make sure that it   s offered to them and then if  they want to take advantage of it.  Like you said, we did ask that people not give us little mementos that  you have to sit around and dust. We asked for art because we thought  when people toured the mansion it would be interesting to them to see  the art from people around the state. I can remember during the   I think  it was the Diamond Jubilee, maybe, I got a group of legislators    wives to  come to the Capitol   to the mansion   and we made a quilt for the  Diamond Jubilee. Something like that, that   s art. Every county in the  state contributed a block. They could have anything on their block that  depicted their county, like if it was cornflowers or if it was wheat or if it  was buffalo or whatever. They quilted their own block and then we as a  group put it together, and the quilt   I think it   s still out there floating  around somewhere. It traveled all over the state to all the fairs, and  anybody that wanted to use it or exhibit it could do that. So we just tried  to get as many different groups to give everybody the opportunity to be  recognized.  I can remember there was a great organization called the China Painters  of Oklahoma, and they painted a set of china for the mansion. I bought  the china   it was just plain white china   and it was of the wildflowers  of Oklahoma, and it   s still there, it   s still being used and it   s absolutely  gorgeous. They did not allow any one painter to complete a piece. They  didn   t want them to be able to say,    I made that plate    or    I made that  cup.    So maybe you were an expert in painting pansies, so you would  just paint a pansy and then you would go on to the next piece and paint a  pansy, and then whoever was good with butterflies maybe would do the  butterfly. So the pieces were passed around to the women and they  painted whatever they were good at. Then we put a gold edging around  the white china and it   s absolutely beautiful. The set of china is  absolutely beautiful. So that was another way to spotlight our artists in  Oklahoma, and we have so many.  I think when people think of art in Oklahoma, they just think of western  art, but there certainly is more out there   more talented people out there.  You know, the storytellers to me were a very fascinating group of  people. Just like you   re doing here with this oral history. Oral history is  so important to pass down to the young people.  Well take me through life after UCO.  Oh, gosh, life after UCO. We moved back to Oklahoma City and of  course George retired. He   s probably retired about five times, and he   s  still working. We bought a house in a neighborhood that we had always  admired. It was an older neighborhood with lots of trees and we just sort  24  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  of went about our daily lives. I still spend 75 percent of my time doing  volunteer work   that   s what I was doing then   and George did contract  work for two or three different people. We have a house on Grand Lake  so we spend quite a bit of our time there when we can. We enjoy that  very much, and it   s a place to go to get away, but it   s also a place to take  your friends and take your family for special occasions. When you think  about it, George has been out of office for 20 years, so it   s not like we  walk down the street and everybody knows who we are. So much time  has passed that we   re just the average guy on the street. (Laughs)  You know, it   s funny sometimes   and I   ve done it, too   you   ll see  somebody and you   ll think,    I know them. Where did I know them?    So  people have asked George. The one I love is,    Oh, yeah. You   re the  weatherman.    (Laughter) They knew they had seen him, and so they  decided he was the weatherman.  I could think of worse things.  That   s right.  I   d just like to get your thoughts on a few things. First off, were you in  Oklahoma   near Oklahoma City   during the time of the bombing?  Yes. That   s when George was at UCO     Okay.     and I can remember, I was out in my back yard talking on a cell phone  to a friend of mine and we both said,    Did you hear that?    We both  heard it and gosh, we lived probably 15 miles from downtown. For some  reason I just thought,    Oh, somebody broke the sound barrier   , a plane.  But of course it wasn   t very long until I found out what had happened,  and it was a very important part for UCO. They have a very good, large  nursing school at UCO and George dismissed all of them. All the  nursing students went as a body downtown to help and they were there  for many days. So UCO offered a lot of their services, their security     well, anything that was needed that we had. Of course we were so close  so it was a very, very strange time to be around. I can remember for  several weeks afterwards, you could not leave your house that you were  not caught in a funeral procession. So many people were found several  weeks later, so the funerals just went on for weeks.  I personally did not have any close friends that lost their lives. I knew a  lot of people that were injured and several of the people that were killed  I knew who they were, but as far as having anyone close to me, I did not.  But it was a strange time in Oklahoma   s history, and I think what a  25  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  horrible way for people to recognize you. Oklahoma truly was  recognized at that time for our people, our willingness, the ability to  bring all the forces together in a hurry and to do what had to be done. I  don   t think many people will ever forget, just like, you knew where you  were when this happened and this happened and 9/11 and when  Kennedy  was assassinated  and all these things. Well, anybody that  lives around here remembers that day and what a horrible day it was, not  only in the history of Oklahoma, but in the history of the nation.  Absolutely. And now we have this, you know, beautiful monument to  remember     And it is so beautiful. You being from out of state, do you remember  when it happened?  I do, and it   s just like any event   you   re in shock, and not living here, I  can   t imagine what Oklahomans were going through, but one thing that  was clear was the immediate mobilization of resources and Oklahomans  helping Oklahomans.  Right. Just like the ministers of the churches were there to assist; people  that did things like masseuses   you know, you wouldn   t think of that,  but they were there to help relieve, when the firemen and policemen  would get a little time off to rest, they were there to give them little  massages on their shoulders and their arms. Just all different types of  vocations were able to be utilized, and the people that could not go     well, like myself   I had no reason to go. I didn   t want to get in the way  but you could drop off clothing or every day they would say what they  needed there; perhaps it was bottled water, perhaps it was towels,  whatever. There was something for everybody, and I would say virtually  everybody was involved.  At that time, when it happened, Bill Clinton was President, and he  appointed George head of a committee to raise funds so that any child of  someone that was killed would be guaranteed a college education totally  paid for. So George chaired that committee to raise the funds, and they  did that. I remember seeing in the paper, just like last year or something,  the first child graduated that had been a part of that. They didn   t put any  restrictions, like they didn   t have to go to school in Oklahoma. They  didn   t have to go to a four-year college. If a young lady wanted to go to  beauty college, she could do that, or if you wanted to go to California to  go to college, you could do that, so it was wonderful. It also paid for the  widows that were left that were pregnant at the time that happened. That  unborn child was also covered. So later on, President Clinton came to  the campus of UCO. That was his only public appearance as President in  Oklahoma and he came just to congratulate the school and what they had  26  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  done. And of course he met with the people that were raising the funds  for the educations, but that was a big thing for UCO to get the President  of the United States to come and visit.  Well I know you   ve had the opportunity to work with many key  legislators through your career. One in particular I   d like to get your  thoughts on is Hannah Atkins. Did you have many dealings with her?  Not personally, but we were around Hannah a lot because Hannah was  very important to my husband during his administration. She helped  him, I think, understand and to better communicate with that  community. She was such a lovely, intelligent lady. If she saw him  doing something that she didn   t think was appropriate or she could think  of a way he could better handle a situation in dealing perhaps with the  black caucus or whatever, she was always by his side. As best I  remember, he appointed her Secretary of State. She was just a lovely  lady and I was around her a lot, but as far as having any dealings with  any of my projects, I did not. I was just associated with her through  George.  Outside of what we   ve talked about with the homes, did you do any other  lobbying on a daily basis while you were First Lady?  No, not really. You find out very quickly that they do not want you over  there. They really don   t. They just really don   t think that   s the place for  the wife of the governor, that she should stay out of the   and I tried. I  really did try to make myself scarce. I never went into the Capitol unless  I had business there. I didn   t just hang around. At the time, my office  was at the mansion. I think now the First Lady   s office is in the Capitol,  but they really just think that it   s not the place for the governor   s wife.  So other than that one experience   and to be quite frank, I didn   t want  any more experiences. (Laughter) I learned that dealing with the  legislature was very difficult   the games they play   and I wasn   t used  to it. I understand why they do what they do, but it   s a tough game. It   s     I   ll do this for you if you   ll do this for me,    and I just didn   t think that  was my place.  Now I   m not going to say I didn   t try to influence my husband in certain  matters, but it always was, to me, matters of the heart, things that I was  really interested in that I felt like maybe he didn   t really understand what  was going on and what was needed and what was involved. We had  open house every Wednesday at the mansion and there was not a  Wednesday went by when open house was over that I didn   t find notes  left around the house   and usually under my pillow in the bedroom     wanting me to try to influence him to do something. I think most people  realize that wives do have influence over their husbands. Why not take  27  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  advantage of it? (Laughs)  Well one of the questions we try to ask all of the inductees   I think we  learn the background we need for our careers in different places,  whether it   s in the classroom or out in the field. Where are some of the  places you feel like that prepared you the most for the work you did as  First Lady, as an advocate for children?  I really don   t think I had any preparation for it. As I mentioned before, I  was a single parent. I was just working hard to keep my head above  water. I think most of the things I learned and the things I became  passionate about happened after the fact, after I got involved and after I  saw what I felt like was needed or things that I could be effective in   it  was at that time. So I would say I was self-taught, tried to learn all I  could about the things I was interested in and tried to surround myself  with knowledgeable people, people that were educated in those fields  that could help me understand and be more effective.  Any major stumbling blocks or adversity you faced along the way?  Well we had a lot of stumbling blocks with the group homes. That was  one of those things that nobody really wanted to talk about or to get  involved in because it meant things happening in their neighborhood that  they didn   t understand. Most of the misunderstanding was just not being  educated. Most people think being mentally retarded is the same thing as  being mentally ill, so most people were frightened. We would hold town  meetings to try to explain to them and to educate them a little bit about  the population that would be living in their neighborhoods. The  stumbling blocks were the city councils that would not grant us zoning  for neighborhoods. There again, they were responding to the people in  their towns   which is what they   re supposed to do   but we had  stumbling blocks, but we really were able to work through them after we  explained, you know, what we were doing. I would say almost without  exception, they all proved to be an asset to the community, to the  neighborhoods and something that was sorely needed to be able to say  we   re giving everybody a chance, and those people needed a chance.  Needed somebody to believe in them.  Well I believed in them, and I think I was just always so grateful that I  had healthy children. We never know when those things can happen to  us. I would look at those parents and think I could not imagine what  their life was like because they could never get away from it. It wasn   t  like okay, they   re going to graduate from high school and then they   re  going to go to college and be out on their own. For the most part, these  people were going to be living with their parents for the rest of their  28  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  lives. I would see young couples that would have a handicapped child     and so many of them were severely handicapped   and stop and think  they could never go out to dinner. They could never go to a movie. They  had no relief because there were not trained people to come in and take  care of that child.  We did establish respite care around in some of the communities. If a  family wanted to go on a vacation, there was a place for this child to stay  for a week or two, or maybe just for an evening out or just to spend one  night   maybe they had to go to a funeral somewhere. It   s a big problem  for these families that don   t have perhaps family members to help them  out, to know what they   re going to do with that child when emergencies  arise or just to be able to hold your marriage together. It   s very hard on  marriages to have children with chronic diseases or to be  developmentally disabled. Of course, there are various degrees of it, and  some were just a lot worse than others. My heart always went out to  those parents that really had no life outside of taking care of that child     and that was going to be forever.  Well, we all kind of have a few moments we consider just really big  highlights for us. What are a few of your big highlights? It   s plural, so  you could have more than one.  Oh, gosh. I should have thought about this. (Laughter) Of course you  have highlights in your family and then you have highlights in your job,  your profession. Every year the governors in the fall have a meeting   a  governors    meeting   that   s always held in Washington. Now in the  summertime, their meetings move around, but the winter governors     meeting was always a really big deal. We always had a formal dinner at  the White House and   I mean, very formal   and that was always very  exciting to be there with the other governors and the President of the  United States. Other highlights were being able to travel to exotic places  that I would not have ever been able to have done otherwise. We  established relationships with towns in Japan and in China and in  Mexico and various other countries. So some of the places that I was  able to travel were highlights. Election night was always a highlight.  Fortunate for me, we were never on the losing side. Now before George  and I were married, he had lost a race, but after we were married, we did  not have a losing race, so that was always a big highlight.  Watching your children grow and mature and succeed and those kinds of  things, but I   m sure I   ll get home and I   ll think,    Well why didn   t I think  of this?    Just having things happen and being able to do things that are  out of the ordinary was a highlight for me because I grew up very  modest. I had a very modest upbringing. My family never traveled  much. I just basically went to school and worked, and so this was all     29  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  my life became sort of a fairy tale. I really tried to earn   I felt a deep  commitment to not just be the governor   s wife. I wanted to be my own  person and to be known for the things that I did on my own. I didn   t  want to just hang onto his coattail, and I really tried to pay back. One  time I remember I was at a luncheon and I sat next to a Catholic nun,  and she made a statement to me that I   ve never forgotten. She said,     Service is the price we pay for the space we occupy.    I   ve really tried  to live my life that way because I truly believe that we all owe  something. We need to give back because of the space we occupy here  on earth and the wonderful things that have been afforded us, we need to  pay back.  That   s just a great outlook. Let   s back up. You mentioned election night.  Did you have watch parties? Try to take me through a typical election  night. Nervousness?  Oh, goodness. Yes, no matter how well you thought you were doing or  you were going to do, you always have those   maybe it   s 30 minutes,  maybe it   s an hour, maybe it   s the whole evening   because it depends  on where the votes are coming from that are being counted first. So  maybe early on in the evening you   re ahead by 20,000 votes but then  you realize well that   s coming from someplace you ought to do well.  What about all these counties that you know you   re not doing well? So  it   s all night long, no matter what the polls have shown or anything, you  really never know. You   re scared to death to declare victory or to act too  heady about it all until it   s all said and done. But we always had watch  parties, and we had fun watch parties. We made them to where anybody  was welcome, anybody could come.  We normally would go to Tulsa first since we lived in Oklahoma City  and the Capitol was in Oklahoma City, we wanted to end the evening  here. So early in the evening, we would go to Tulsa to our watch party  there, and that would involve other counties in that area. Then we would  fly here to be here for the latter part of the evening. But it was just such  fun. I can remember one race that we thought there was no question that  we were going to win and we were going to win big, and we barely  squeaked by. So you never know, but it   s a fun experience. It really is.  And did you have a role during the swearing-in ceremonies?  Well, the wife traditionally holds the Bible that her husband uses during  the swearing-in, so yeah, you   re up there. It   s the judge and you and  your husband or   you can   t say that anymore   you and your spouse, I  guess. Then your family is seated there on the platform with you and, of  course, with it always being in January, you never knew what the  weather was going to be like. I can remember one in particular that  30  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  literally our feet   our shoes   froze to the platform, it was that cold.  None of ours were ever held indoors because of the weather, but the  weather could be pretty rough in January. But then you have a public  reception where you stand in line and anybody that wants to can come in  and go through the receiving line. It   s not just you, it   s all of the state-wide  elected officials, so it   s a very busy time.  Then you have a ball; that   s fun, but all those things are a lot of work. A  lot of people have worked very hard to make them successful. I  remember George   s last election, he carried all 77 counties. He   s the  only person to ever do that, so he wanted at the ball to have 77  trombones march in, so the music director at OU   you know the song     76 Trombones?    Well ours was    76 plus 1,    and they obtained a  trombonist from every county in the state, and that trombonist wore their  local band uniform. That was how that ball was opened, with those 77  trombonists marching in playing the song. So we always tried to make  everything fun   fun more than stuffy, not too formal because we wanted  everybody to feel like they could come and to be a part of it.  That   s a great way to include the state in such a widespread victory   I  mean, carrying all 77 counties, that   s good stuff.  The last election, Governor Henry carried, I think, 70   all of the  counties except the panhandle. He accused George of going out there  and campaigning against him so he wouldn   t carry them. (Laughter)  The record has to stay. (Laughter)  Oh, that was funny.  Well moving toward the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame, do you  remember when you were notified that you were going to be inducted?  You know, I don   t. I can remember the night, particularly because my  daughter at the time was living in Georgia, and I arrived that night for  the festivities. There my daughter was and her husband and my two-year-  old granddaughter. That was a big surprise and a big thrill. But I  was so honored to be a part of the Women   s Hall of Fame and I hope it  will always continue. I don   t even know how many they induct now  each year, but it was fairly new when I was inducted. I don   t even  remember the year. Do you have that?  You were inducted in 1995, and I believe they started inducting folks in  1982, so it is relatively new. What does this type of honor mean to you?  You   ve been honored many times for many, many different things, but in  particular this honor.  31  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  To be recognized as an individual and, again, not just because I was the  Governor   s wife. As an individual, I tried to contribute and hopefully,  down the road, if these interviews are listened to by young women     hopefully through the Women   s Hall of Fame, young women can see  that women are recognized for their accomplishments, that it will be an  encouragement to them. When I was inducted, George had been out of  office for several years. I was totally, totally shocked that I would be  included because there are so many women, professional women     scientists, teachers, astronauts   you name it we have them in Oklahoma.  And just to be included in this group was a great honor for me.  How do you feel that now people look to you as that role model?  Nobody looks to me for a role model. (Laughs)  Oh, come on.  That   s kind of hard to talk about yourself like that. I don   t know. I just  don   t ever think of being a role model. Is there another question?  Sure. If you could give any piece of advice to your fellow Oklahomans,  what would you tell them?  To be proud of their state. I   ve always felt like we   ve kind of had the  tendency to apologize for the fact that we live in Oklahoma, like,    Why  would you live in Oklahoma? What does Oklahoma have to offer? Why  would         and I think our pride has really increased in the last 20  years. People are taking more pride but what better place in the world  could you live? You look at all the statistics and the polls that come out  about the most economical place to live, the safest place to live, where  the unemployment is the lowest   that   s not to say that there   s not so  many things that we could improve upon, we can always improve. I  think anyone that moves here from out of state, probably the first thing  they would tell you that they liked about Oklahoma are the people. I  think that   s the greatest thing we have going for us, and just to keep up  being who we are.  I think we   ve been through some really tough times, and some really  horrible things have happened to Oklahoma and to Oklahomans   and  we always come through. Of course, we   re teased a lot about our  tornadoes and things like that, but name a state that doesn   t have some  natural disaster that they deal with. It   s going to be hurricanes or it   s  going to be forest fires or it   s going to be something. So we   re no  different than anybody else. Everybody has their natural disasters that  occur. Being one of the youngest states and to see the progress that  we   ve made and the wonderful, talented people that have come out of  32  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  this state   I mean, you name a profession or an occupation and almost  without exception there   s an Oklahoman either at the top or near the top.  We have produced some wonderful, wonderful talented people.  I would just like to see us sing our praises. If we don   t toot our horn,  who   s going to toot it? So just be glad, be happy of where you   re from.  Be proud of the people that are here, and no matter where you go, to not  be embarrassed to say where you   re from. It   s kind of fun to go  anywhere in the world and there   s not anyone that hasn   t heard of our  state song, you know. Name one other state that has a state song that  everybody recognizes. So we just need to play on all of the wonderful  things that have happened and be optimistic about the future.  Well my second to the last question is, when history is written about you,  what would you like for it to say?  That I cared. I truly care about Oklahoma. I want Oklahoma to be the  very best it can be. I want all of our people to be given the opportunities,  not just a few, but that everyone be given   I like to say things cannot be  right for any of us until it   s right for all of us, and that is being socially  accepted with whatever has happened, to be given all the opportunities,  whether it   s in school or in athletics or professionally in the workplace,  that everybody have a place in society where they can feel good about  themselves. All of us like to feel good about ourselves, and those people  that have been dealt some hard blows in life, they deserve that right, too.  They deserve the right to feel good about themselves   and to give them  the opportunity to be the very best that they can be. I would just like to  be remembered as someone that worked toward that end and truly cared  that everybody be treated the same and be given the same opportunities.  Finally, is there anything that I have not asked you that you would like  to make mention of? Anything that I   ve left out that you   d like to  include?  I think you   ve done a pretty good job of covering my life. It   s been a  good life, one that I   m very grateful to have been given the opportunities  that I have. I just hope that I will always feel like I   ve made the most of  those opportunities. I love what you   re doing. I love for women to be  recognized. I love for minorities to be recognized. It   s an exciting time  to be alive. Things are happening now that we never in our wildest  imagination ever thought we would see happen. I think that oral history  is extremely important. I think occasionally I   ll say something or  mention something that happened to me in my life, and my daughter will  say,    Well, I didn   t know that. You never told me that.    I think just even  in dealing with our families, our children, our grandchildren, we don   t  realize how important some of the little things that we   ve forgotten will  33  Nykolaiszyn  Nigh  be to them.  I commend you all for what you   re doing to make oral history important,  and I hope that it can be utilized to its fullest   OETA or anything that  would get it out to the public   to let the people see what they didn   t  have the chance to live through   how important. Everyone in Oklahoma  is an immigrant   I mean, we all came from somewhere. I   ve been  studying my own genealogy, and I   ve learned a lot of things about my  own family. So I commend you all for what you   re doing and I  appreciate being a part of your study of the women in the Hall of Fame.  Well we appreciate your time. Thank you very much again for sharing  your story with us.  You   re so welcome.  -------  -------
