 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Thursday, August 23rd,2007 and I   m in Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma, interviewing Terry Neese. This interview is being  conducted as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame Oral History Project. Terry Neese was inducted into the  Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame in 2007. She is a public policy  strategist and award-winning small business owner. Thanks for joining  us today.  Thank you. It   s good to be here with you.  Let   s get started by learning a little more about you. Could you start  with where you grew up and give a little background on your early life.  I grew up in Oklahoma, in a very small farming community called  Cookietown, Oklahoma. Population about, at the time when I was  growing up, there were around ten to fifteen people that lived in  Cookietown, Oklahoma. Essentially, it had two little gas stations and a  church. And so my early life was spent on a farm learning what I think is  real, true entrepreneurship.  Okay, tell me about the schools you attended growing up.  I   m a product of a consolidated school system. I first started to school at  Union Valley School, which was just a short ways from Cookietown     about five miles from Cookietown. I started first grade and was only in  first grade for a couple of weeks and was promoted to the third grade. I  might have some things to say about that a little bit later, because I   m  not sure that was a good thing. I think I missed a lot of knowledge and  just camaraderie with first graders and second graders and then jumped  to third. It was a big jump. So, it was somewhat difficult for me, the later  years in school.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  There was a school consolidation of Randlett High School and the  school system at Randlett, the school system in Devol, Oklahoma and  the school system in Union Valley. And so, the consolidation became  known as Big Pasture. So this was in the south-western part of  Oklahoma, really close to the Red River. I ended up graduating though  from Burkburnett High School, right across the Texas State Line, but  attended school at Big Pasture High School through my sophomore year.  Were there a lot of students in your different grades? How big were the  schools?  There were four people in my first grade class. Moving to the third grade  class   I think there were still four or five people my third grade class.  When we consolidated, there were probably twenty to twenty-five  people in my class. When I left Big Pasture High School and went to  Burkburnett High School, I went from thirty people to 250, 300 people,  and that was a real shock to me. My grades went in the tank. It was just a  terrible adjustment for me. I was 13, 14 years old and so it was really a  tough adjustment for me. But so much of my fabric is built around the  classes for me in my high school years and grade school years in  Oklahoma and North Texas.  When you were growing up, what were some of you favorite subjects?  You know, I loved sports. (Laughs) Sports were really my thing. I loved  basketball. I could stand for hours at the goal at home or in the  auditorium and shoot basketballs, or the Gymnasium. I really loved  basketball. I loved social studies and I loved history. I loved  geography   so kind of out of the norm, I suppose. When I went to  college, I loved business classes, anything and everything about  business. And that really started fairly young, I   d say in high school     really learning about entrepreneurship, small business, and then that  carried through my college days.  Now growing up, outside of your school activities, what did you like to  do for fun when you were at home?  I loved horses and riding horses and spending time with my horses. So,  it was either horses or basketball, one of the two. I also loved the land. I  loved to be in the fields with my dad. We grew primarily wheat and  cotton. And so, being on the tractor and plowing the fields and just  loving the land. The wheat crops   helping harvest wheat. I didn   t like  harvesting cotton that well or picking cotton that well, but I really  enjoyed the wheat. I loved being in the fields and feeling the weather on  my face, the dirt from the fields on my face, and just spending time with  Dad.  6  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Did you have a set chore on the farm that you had to do growing up?  Yes I did. Some of the chores I did not like. For example, cleaning out  chicken houses, gathering eggs when there were perhaps snakes in the  chicken house   that I hated. Feeding the cows, feeding the horses, just  taking care of livestock around the farm primarily. I did not like to do  household chores. I wanted to be outside in the fields or doing chores  and spending time with Dad.  When you were growing up and you were sitting there on the farm and  you were thinking about your life, what did you want to be? What did  you picture yourself doing when you were older?  Oh, my gosh, you know, I don   t think I gave it a lot of thought. I thought  that I would probably continue to be on the farm. I thought that I would  marry someone who would probably be in farming and ranching and that  I would spend most of my time in southwest Oklahoma continuing to  work on the land and be a part of our great soil in this state. I did think  some about business and what role I might play in the business world.  But it seemed a long way from Cookietown to developing a business,  because my circle was Cookietown   that was town, and we   re talking  five, six people. Periodically we got to go to Walters, Oklahoma or  Temple, Oklahoma, which also is not a large populated town. So being  in business, and being in the business world was a dream out there, but  I   m not sure I ever thought I would make that dream come true.  As you were growing up who were some of the people you looked up to,  who were some of your role models?  I would have to say my dad because of the entrepreneurial spirit it takes  to be a farmer and a rancher. My mother because she was the true stay at  home mom that always made sure the household ran appropriately. She  was always there and she was terrific   a wonderful role-model. As I  grew up I had a science teacher that was very much a mentor to me and  was very special. And a math teacher, although math was not my best  subject. He was certainly a great mentor to me and really encouraged me  to become involved more in business, and actually encouraged me to get  a job.  My first job was in a clothing store as a sales clerk and I worked my  junior and senior years in high school. I was involved with DECA,  Distributive Education Clubs of America. And it was really my science  teacher and my math teacher that kept encouraging me and pushing me  toward getting involved in the business world and to get out there and  get a job and to go to school half time and work half time. And that was  really a brilliant stroke of luck for me.  7  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  They helped lay the ground work.  They did. They laid the ground work for me. And made me see that my  dream and my vision could actually happen, and that   s really  phenomenal.  Now, we spoke a little bit about your mother and your father. Tell about  your family, do you have any siblings? If you   re married, tell me about  your husband, your children.  I do have siblings, I have two sisters. Both are teachers. Unfortunately I  lost my middle sister a few years ago but she was a teacher, a great  teacher. And my older sister is a teacher in Dallas and doing God   s  work. I think teachers are doing God   s work.  I am married to Earl Neese. He is a western author and accountant and  the light of my life. He jokingly says that he taught me everything I  know. Great guy, and has been just a phenomenal supporter of mine.  Always pushing me, always encouraging me, always right there with me  in all the decisions that I ever made in business or life, and I appreciate  and love him so much. I   m trying not to get a little emotional here. I  have a daughter who is also the light of my life. Interestingly enough  she, I don   t think, ever thought she would be involved in the business  world to a great extent   certainly not own a company. But after I  founded Terry Neese Personnel Services and built that business over the  last thirty years, I encouraged her to come into the business and continue  the legacy of the business, and she has done that. She   s now been in the  business for about eight or nine years and is doing frankly, I think, a  much better job of operating the business than I did. So, it   s been a real  pleasure to see her come in and take over the business and continue to  build it and take it to the next level.  It sounds like family plays   even when you were younger   an important  role in your life. If you could touch upon that for me, please.  You know, I think years ago we really took care of our family. Often  times Grandma and Grandpa lived with Mom and Dad and the children.  We had aunts and uncles around. We had cousins around. We all lived  within a few miles of each other, so it was a lot of family time. And  today, I think, that   s not the case so much. I think that   s sad, because  family is so important and so critical to you. You don   t realize it when  you   re young, but as you get a little older, you begin to realize how  important that history is, how important the legacy is, and what it means  to you, what it means to your children, and what it means to your  grandchildren.  8  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Today, there are few aunts and uncles that are close by. There are few  grandmothers and grandfathers that are close by.  An example is my mother continued to live in the southwest part of  Oklahoma and the northern part of Texas all of her life. She is now  eighty-five years old. About four years ago, I decided she didn   t need to  be down there alone by herself, so I moved her to Oklahoma City just a  mile from my home, so that I could spend more time with her, quality  time with her. Our agreement was   she agreed to move here and leave  eighty-one years behind of friends and more friends and her church  friends, if I would agree to come by and have dinner with her every  night that I possibly could. And so we cut that deal and I   m really proud  and pleased that she   s within a couple of minutes of me and my home  and making sure that we can go over and spend time with her, that my  daughter can spend time with her, that my grandchildren can spend time  with her and really develop that relationship, and love that relationship.  I understand you attended college at the University of Oklahoma. Can  you describe your collegiate experience, some of the things you did,  what you studied, how that impacted you     In terms of Oklahoma University  University of Oklahoma , it   s  interesting. My major was secretarial science and this was in the late  sixties. I assumed that I would be a secretary for the rest of my life or an  administrative assistant. So I made sure that I had the necessary skills to  be a good leader in the business, but as a secretary or an administrative  assistant. I loved typing on the old typewriters. I loved shorthand. I  literally lived and breathed the business aspect of secretarial science and  the typing and the shorthand.  Interestingly enough, I married, had my daughter, and worked for a  couple of companies in Norman, Oklahoma as a secretary and quickly  became an office manager in these companies and progressed through  my career in that light. I never thought about owning my own business,  it just happened. And it happened because the businesses I was working  for did not manage their companies so they were profitable, and  therefore, these businesses went out of business. And I all of sudden  thought,    You know, I think I can own and operate a business and make  it profitable,    and so I opened my own companies   started opening my  own companies in the mid-seventies, early seventies actually.  You went into a particular type of business and back then women were  not generally thought of as the business type owner. So tell me about  why you decided to open the type of business you did, what void were  you trying to fill, and how was the climate from your male counterparts,  your competitors in the area feeling.  9  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Well I was so na  ve about opening a business. There weren   t very many  women business owners, and so there was really no one to mentor me or  to give me advice or to help me through that process. The way I opened  the business was really by luck. I got into the personnel business in  Norman by working as a personnel consultant for two different firms. I  loved the business because I was helping people with the second most  important thing in their life after their family. And that is their career  and being successful in their career. I was good at it. I had an innate  sense of what a person would be good doing, and I had an innate sense  with the company that was looking for someone, and how to put the  right person in that company. And it was magical, and I loved it   still  do.  I kind of gravitated to helping women primarily with their careers and  their futures. So, I spent a lot of time advising them on how I thought  they could take what they were doing and mold it into managerial spots.  Most of them went to work as secretaries, file clerks, receptionists, and  so my goal was to help them turn those careers into a management role,  or maybe even go out and start their own businesses.  The companies I worked for went out of business, and I decided that I  should take my big fortune which was at the time, about  600 to my  name, and go start my own company. It was very, very difficult. No  banks would loan money to a woman and I had no banking relationships.  I had no vendor relationships. So purchasing, for example, advertising in  The Oklahoman was tough because I had no money and so I had to  negotiate contracts up front, often times asking if I could pay later,  rather than up front. In most instances, businesses here in Oklahoma  would allow me to do that. With that kind of support from the  community, I was able to start a business with virtually no money and  build it into a multi-million dollar business. Today, it would be very,  very difficult to do that. In the seventies, it was very, very difficult to do  that because I was going against the grain of most women not starting a  business and not being their own boss. I had no experience and I had no  real knowledge about how to build a business or how to manage people.  So, I really learned through trial and error, and there were a lot of errors.  (Laughs)  I noticed, looking back at old issues of The Oklahoman, that you would  normally appear in your ads, your picture would. Could you explain    I  noticed several personnel agencies trying to do that, why was that  important to you.  I really wanted people to know that there was a real person running the  firm   that I wasn   t just a name. There are a lot of franchised personnel  services and at the time, most of the franchises were not the real owners.  10  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  They were managers and operators. I wanted people to know that I was  Oklahoma owned, born, bred, and raised in Oklahoma and therefore I  wanted people to know that I really cared about their future and their  career. I also wanted them to know that I really wanted them to stay in  Oklahoma and to remain the fabric of our state. I always hated losing  people to another state because they couldn   t find a job here and when  we had our oil and gas bust in the eighties we lost so many great people.  It was really a brain-drain. But most of my ads were done with me  talking about the importance of us being an Oklahoma-grown company.  Did you find that a lot of people, both from the business end and from  those looking for jobs, were receptive to that, that they would rather  deal with a local than a franchise?  They did like, I believe, to deal with us because we were locally owned,  that we were part of the fabric, we were part of the community. And I  also think many times, when they found out there really was a Terry  Neese   and of course the way I spell my name, with the       y    on the end  of Terry, often times they thought that was a man, and perhaps, I didn   t  realize it, but at the time, perhaps that was good, I don   t know. But when  they found out that I was a woman and they found out that there really  was a Terry Neese that was the owner of Terry Neese Personnel  Services, they were thrilled with that, and so I think it was a plus for us.  We had a lot of adversities after starting Terry Neese Personnel  Services. I purchased a building on Route 66 and they tore up the  highway out in front of me about six months after I purchased the  building. We had no access into my building for two and a half years     real adversity. And then my building burned down, about six months  after the highway opened up and after not having any access to my  building for two and a half years. We had enormous adversities the first  five years we were in business, but you know, we overcame all the odds.  The odds were against us for awhile, but we overcame.  Tell me about a key moment in your career that you consider one of your  biggest highlights.  I think it was in 1986 when I was recruited by the National Association  of Women Business Owners to be a delegate and run as a delegate to the  1986 White House Conference on Small Business. I had never been  involved politically. I had never been involved in policy. I had been in  business at that point, about fifteen years, and policy and politics is not  anything I ever thought of being involved in. It was of no interest to me  at all. And when I ran as a delegate and got elected and attended the  1986 White House conference in Washington DC, a whole new world  opened up to me that I never knew was closed. I saw Washington,  11  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  certainly as a power town. I saw it as a place to make a difference and I  truly caught the spirit of one person can make a difference. We were at  that time also in the oil and gas bust. And I wanted to come home from  that conference and help small businesses thrive. I came back on a  mission to help Oklahoma turn our economy around, to help more men  and women start their own businesses and build their businesses and  grow. And, I really dedicated myself over the last twenty years, to  helping small businesses.  I joined the Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce in 1988, two years  after the White House Conference on Small Business. I started and  formed the very first small business department at the Oklahoma State  Chamber of Commerce. Thanks to Dick Rush who recruited me to leave  my company and join the state chamber and start that small business  division. It was a critical point and a critical decision for Dick, to  develop a small business department   there had never been one. But the  growth of small business was really what brought us out of the economic  doldrums in the eighties. We really turned the state around based on our  help and our love of entrepreneurship and small business. So, I coined  the phrase,    If you run a business, and you   re not involved in politics,  then politics will run your business.    And I believe that whole-heartedly.  I believe every small business owner should be involved in policy and  what our government   what our local, state, and federal government  does because it impacts their bottom line.  Do you think most small business owners realize that? I think they   re so  focused on their business and making it successful, do you think a lot of  them see the bigger picture? Why should they take that step and become  involved locally and nationally?  I think they don   t see that. They don   t see that public policy and politics  really play a role in their business life. And I understand that, because I  spent fifteen years in that role myself. I didn   t think it did either. I never  thought about it. All I was doing was putting my blinders on and  working and building my business, and you do have to do that in the  early stages. But, I believe that you have to throw in the politics and the  public policy because what the legislature does and what our state  government does, impacts our bottom line. Whether it   s healthcare,  whether its tax reform, whether it   s federal government contracting, or  state government contracting, or perhaps it   s the environment.  Everything, every decision that   s made and every piece of legislation  that is passed, is going to impact us in some way, from the stop sign  down at the corner to the check that we write to the IRS  Internal  Revenue Service    it all impacts us. And it   s a huge process, but every  single person can make a difference in their government if they will just  get involved.  12  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  I believe your government is only as effective as the input it receives  from you. I also believe that our elected officials are our employees.  And I think it   s important we give our employees performance reviews.  We can do that at the ballot box and one vote can often times, make a  big difference.  Now, in 1990 you made history as the first woman nominated by a major  political party for lieutenant governor. How did that bid come about?  It was, again, back to small business. I really believed that the lieutenant  governor   s office could be a bully pulpit to help small business and  especially women and minorities small business owners build their  businesses and take their businesses to the next level. So the lieutenant  governor   s spot in my opinion was the best place to become involved in  policy, and to assist small business owners in Oklahoma. Now should I  have started at a much lower level, for example, a county commissioner,  or a city council role, or something like that. You know, hindsight   s  20/20, and that   s probably what I should have done. But, I   m a dreamer  and I   m a visionary and so I really felt the lieutenant governor   s spot  was the right place for me to go.  I   ve been very good friends with Gladys Warren who also ran for  lieutenant governor but didn   t make a primary, was not the nominee. I  was also good friends with Cleta Deatherage  Mitchell  and Cleta never  became a nominee as well. They were really on the forefront for running  for state-wide office, as a woman. I had no clue what I was getting  myself into when I announced in 1990 that I wanted to seek the office of  lieutenant governor. Becoming the first woman nominated for that role, I  believe, led immediately to 1994, Mary Fallin winning the nomination  and going on to winning the office of lieutenant governor, Brenda  Reneau becoming labor commissioner, Denise Bode, Laura Boyd, Sandy  Garrett   I mean all of these women, all of a sudden, ran for office and  were elected. I felt like I was on the cusp of helping.  Although I was not elected, but became the first woman nominated for  lieutenant governor, I felt like I gave the foundation for women then to  step out there and announce for state-wide office and win. And I   m  thrilled with that. Would I have run my campaign differently? Yes   lots  of mistakes. Oh, I learned so many things and so many things I did  wrong. But, I believe the things I did wrong, perhaps helped other  women later on down the line to go and win.  Do you think you would ever run for office again in any capacity?  Oh, I wouldn   t rule it out but, I don   t think so. I think I have bigger  things   not that being in office isn   t a big thing, it is. We all have  13  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  somewhere to serve and I think my role has been helping women not just  in Oklahoma, but around the world.  Well getting to around the world, you co-founded a national bi-partisan  organization called Women Impacting Public Policy  WIPP . Why did  you feel forming this public policy group was important?  I had served as president   national president of the National Association  of Women Business Owners, so I had travelled the country, almost all  fifty states, speaking and meeting and talking with women business  owners. They really did not have a voice in our Nation   s Capitol and I  was concerned about that. I spent a great deal of time in Washington  working with our elected officials on small business issues, from about  1986 to 2000. And in 2000, I thought we had turned a corner because I  had spent so much time on the Hill, and I was the only person there  advocating for women business owners.  I believe that all women and women   s business associations needed to  come together with one voice and impact policy that affected our  businesses and our bottom lines. So forming Women Impacting Public  Policy, I brought about thirty women   s business associations to the table  and said,    We need to all join hands and we need to speak with one  voice. We will never agree on every issue. I don   t agree with my  husband on every issue, but we can come together on some economic  issues that will help us be more self-sufficient and help women who  want to start and grow businesses if we all come together.    So,  fortunately, everyone around that table, many who didn   t like each other  very much and often had arguments on different topics, agreed to come  together and join hands, and be one voice around economic issues, and  this is what formed Women Impacting Public Policy. We now have over  600,000 members across the country and we have forty-six women   s  business associations that are under our umbrella. We make sure that  their voices are heard, through a survey that we do every year, and we  take their issues and their voice to our Nation   s Capitol every day.  And are you starting to see a serious impact? Are people, legislators  starting to say,    Whoa, these women mean business here.     We do. Many of the legislators, many senators and house members that I  could name for you, for example chairman of Small Business, Don  Manzullo, House Committee on Small Business, Senator Bond, Senator  Kerry   they have said to me,    We will not author any legislation that  impacts women business owners, until we talk to you first. We want to  make sure the legislation   s what you want, if it isn   t what you want, we  want to sit down and talk with you about changes that will make it  right.     14  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  They know that we mean business. They know that women vote often  and in more elections than their male counterparts, and so they want to  make sure we have a seat at the table to give them input on legislation.  Then when they run for office, they want to make sure that there   s a seat  at their table in their campaigns so that we give them advice about what  women in their district or women in their state are wanting and need in  order to build their businesses or in order to feed their families.  It   s 2007 right now, what are some of the big issues that women business  owners are really trying to advocate for?  Women business owners really want to take care of their employees. I  mean, we   re natural nurturers. We want to provide health insurance and  a good benefit package to them. We want to be able to provide as a  small business a Fortune 500 package of benefits to our employees. We  can   t do that, and so we need healthcare reform that can help us help our  employees, and not only that, but help retain our employees. How can  we provide the maximum benefits for them when Fortune 500  companies are way over our head in terms of providing benefits? So,  retention is important and helping take care of them and their families is  very important to us.  There   s also an access to capital issue, still. It   s not anywhere near like it  was in the seventies, but it   s important that women business owners  have access to capital in banks, angel investors, and have access to angel  investors, venture capital. All of these things are critical to women  business owners that are especially in the missing middle, what we   re  calling the missing middle women business owners. These are women  who are now are at a million in revenue and they are trying to take their  business to five million in revenue annually, or ten million in annual  revenues. And so, the access to capital is really critical.  Then the third thing is   many women business owners want to do  business with their state government and with the federal government.  You know the federal government purchases over 300 billion dollars of  products and services from the private sector every year. So women  business owners need to know,    How do I get in that game, how do I  perhaps match up and be a subcontractor with a prime contractor, or how  do I get to know how this works.    It   s complicated. It   s doing business  with the government, which is double complicated. So we want to make  sure that women are on the playing field and they   re able to acquire  multi-million dollar contracts with the state government and the federal  government. And so, WIPP is making sure that many of these women  have access to the knowledge they need to make that happen.  Sounds like a very good clearing house of information.  15  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Excellent clearing house, it is. Anytime our members have a problem  with the IRS or a problem with any government agency, we generally  have a contact somewhere in those agencies where we can be helpful to  our member, whatever their problem is. And I think that   s a huge service  to women business owners that we   re providing.  In September of 2000, Fortune magazine included you on the power  thirty list of the most influential small business persons in Washington,  DC. Can you just touch upon that for me, how did that make you feel?  I was overwhelmed. I was just doing my work and I   ve often said,    Do  something that you love to do and if you do it so well and you love it so  much, you   d do it for free. But you do it so well, you get very well  paid.    I kept thinking,    How did I get there?    And I got there because  I   m passionate about what I do. I   m passionate about making sure that  women understand how politics play a role in their life and I   m  passionate that they understand and realize that they can make a  difference in legislation, and they can make a difference at the polls.  And so, to be recognized by people around the country that we had built  the Women Impacting Public Policy organization to be the most  respected women   s business association in the country, and that my  peers and also Congress had a say in who are the most important people  advocating on Capitol Hill, and they selected me   I was overwhelmed.  And one more, going back into politics, it just seems to be this constant  evolution. In 2005, you were nominated by President Bush to become the  Director of the US Mint. Upon learning the news, how did you feel?  Oh, my gosh, I cried. Well first of all, I thought,    The United States  Mint? The United States Mint?    How does that correlate with small  business and helping women business owners and so it took some time  to get used to that. I had really mixed emotions. I had spent a lot of time  in Washington, but I   d never lived there. I could always come home, and  this is really home. This is me, Oklahoma is me, I am Oklahoma. And  so, we got through all the paper work. Oh my goodness, it   s phenomenal  what you have to go through for a senate confirmation   just  phenomenal. So, knowing that the President had the confidence and the  trust in me, that I could be Director of the Mint, and run the Mint, was  gratifying and was, I think, a tribute to the work and the hard work that  I   ve done over the years.  I was appreciative of his respect and his appreciation of my integrity,  especially the Mint, but then when push came to shove, I had just moved  my mother here. I couldn   t leave her. And my husband had had some  health issues and I just thought,    I can go do this another time, there   s  another time, another place.    So, I decided to stay in Oklahoma. Were  16  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  there distractions? Were there people who didn   t want me to be at the  Mint? There   s always, anytime you   re put up for a nomination like this,  it   s interesting the people who come out of the woodwork that want to  try to dive-bomb your confirmation. That actually happened after I had  withdrawn my nomination. They didn   t know I had withdrawn my  nomination, but it actually happened.  Interestingly enough, it   s a great thing that I ended up staying here. My  mom   s 85 years old and I   ve spent a lot of time with her. She   s had  some serious health problems over the last couple years so it was a really  good thing that I stayed here. Then I ended up starting the Women  Impacting Public Policy Institute and working with the Afghan women,  and so, God usually puts you where you   re supposed to be.  Now I heard you just returned from Afghanistan, what are the types of  things you   re trying to do over there?  Last year, I formed the Women Impacting Public Policy Institute and it  is essentially economic empowerment of women, worldwide. I was  asked by the White House and the State Department to help women  business owners in Afghanistan. Initially I thought,    Why would I want  to do that? And I certainly don   t want to go there for any period of  time.    But then I started thinking about the fact that Afghanistan   s  constitution calls for 25  of their lower parliament to be women. We  don   t even have that here in the United States. And 14  of our United  States Senate are women, only 14 . Afghanistan has 25  in their  constitution. So I thought,    If I could help educate them on  entrepreneurship and freedom and democracy, and they go back, in turn,  and start a business and grow a business and/or run for office, and run  for parliament, it   s a small step towards peace through business.     So, I developed the Peace Through Business Program and we   ve just  brought twelve women business owners from Afghanistan to the United  States and they are obtaining a mini-MBA program at Northwood  University, which is headquartered in Midland, Michigan. So they   re  five weeks into this program. We   re also having them spend a week with  women business owners here and live with a woman business owner and  follow her in her family life and in her business   shadow her in her  business. We   re matching them up   construction owner, a ball  production company, a tailoring company, a woman who has started a  women   s shopping mall in Afghanistan. We   re bringing four of these  women to Oklahoma in September of this year to network and mentor  and shadow women business owners here in Oklahoma. When they go  back to Afghanistan, our agreement is that they will plug in to economic  development offices across the country of Afghanistan and share their  knowledge that they have learned here in a train-the-trainer scenario. So  17  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  we are thrilled with the opportunity to help these women and for them to  learn about democracy and about building their business.  Some of these women owned a business before the Taliban took control.  They had to close their business. They could not walk outside their home  without being on the arm of a man. They could no longer go to school.  Girls were completely banned from going to school. Women were  banned from going to college or any of the universities in Afghanistan.  That has now been eradicated and they are able to go to school. They   re  able to open their own businesses and build their own businesses. And I  think it is incumbent upon us, as women here in the United States, to  reach out to our sisters around the world and help make sure that they  are self sufficient and some are in fact in parliament. Perhaps they will  take this Peace Through Business message with them to parliament and  help us around the world to be more peaceful.  Sounds like a lot of good stuff you   re doing.  I think it is good stuff.  Oh yes     Really making a difference around the world.  Definitely, definitely. And you started out wanting to make a difference  in women   s lives and you still continue to do that to this day, on a global  scale, it   s really just amazing. Turning to the Oklahoma Women   s Hall  of Fame, when you were notified that you were going to be inducted,  what was going through your mind at that time?  I will never forget where I was the day I got the call. I cried after I got  off the phone. I thought a little girl from Cookietown, Oklahoma was  going to be in the Hall of Fame and I was overwhelmed with emotion, as  I am now. It   s really incredible to be honored by your peers, by fellow  Oklahomans, and to have the opportunity to pass your knowledge on to  others. And I   m hopeful in some way that I will always be able to do  that.  I   m appreciative of the women who had the foresight to set up and  establish an Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame. Thank God there were  women who were thinking about the legacy that women were leaving in  this state. They are the real heroes and so I   m grateful to them for their  vision and for their forethought, and the impact that these women, who  established the Hall of Fame, the impact that they   ve had on Oklahoma.  Do you remember who presented it to you at the ceremony?  18  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Yes, Don Cain who is the president of AT T here in Oklahoma. Don  and I became acquainted in Washington, DC. I worked with him  extensively on telecom legislation and we became very good friends.  Interestingly enough, I travelled abroad and was actually in Greece and  when I came home started thumbing through some old Oklahoma  newspapers. I   d been gone two weeks and he was on the front page that  he was the new president of AT T Oklahoma. I didn   t even know he  had moved here. So I was thrilled that Don had come to Oklahoma to be  a part of our leadership here in the state and it just so happened that he  knew a lot about my public policy background, what I had done in  Washington and across the country, and so, for Don to present to me at  the Hall of Fame was a real honor and I really appreciate him and what  he   s doing here in Oklahoma as well.  Did you have a lot of supporters in attendance, your family?  I did have a lot of supporters. I had people who drove in from various  parts of the state. Some people I hadn   t seen in a long time, employees  that have worked for me, years ago, and so it was a real blessing just to  see people that I haven   t seen for years and to have an experience to  spend a little bit of time with them.  All of the women in the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame are just so  amazing. How do you feel now that you   re among that group and people  look at you now as a role model?  Well, I think there are a lot of women in the Hall of Fame that should be  looked at as role models rather than me. I mean, I feel very blessed to  just have a seat at that table. There are so many women in the Hall of  Fame that I would love to spend time with, that I look up to, that have  formed their life here in Oklahoma and made so many changes in this  state that have impacted so many people and so, just to be in their  presence and maybe we should develop some kind of a role where we all  get together every now and then and we   re able to network with each  other and spend a little bit of time with each other because   there   s a  phenomenal group of women that   s in this Hall of Fame and I   m blessed  to just be in their presence.  Can you tell me a little something about the people you   d like to thank,  that played an important role in your life?  Well certainly my family. Without them, there   s just no way I   d be  where I am. Ray Ackerman, who I usually call Mr. Oklahoma City. Ray  Ackerman of Ackerman-McQueen was a real role model for me growing  my company. He   s a dynamic leader, he   s a visionary, he always  encouraged me to dream big, and I appreciated that and respected that so  19  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  much. Gladys Warren, who was a wonderful political mentor, and I  believe a great person, is someone I will always have deep appreciation  for. Then there are literally hundreds of leaders across the country that  have played a role in helping me reach the pinnacles of success and I  appreciate them more than words can say.  If you could give any piece of advice to fellow Oklahomans, what would  you tell them?  Oh, my. I would say to follow your passion, to dream and dream big, to  love the land, and be a good spirit for Oklahoma and to be a good voice  and a good advocate for Oklahoma. I   ve travelled so much, and so many  people have said to me that they thought Oklahoma was a third world  country, and it makes me so angry. So I think all of us need to be  ambassadors for this great state. I mean, there is no where on earth that  is better to live than right here in Oklahoma. We are so blessed to live in  this state and we need to really appreciate it and take care of it.  What would be your advice to women that stand to follow in your  footsteps?  Oh my gosh, you   d be crazy. (Laughter) Don   t do it  I think for anyone  that wants to help people, there are so many opportunities out there for  someone who is passionate about helping others   American Cancer  Society, the Heart Association. There are so many needs and so there   s  so many things, but I would always say to determine what your passion  is and whatever your passion is, if you follow that passion, you   ll be  successful. I firmly believe that.  In your spare time, I see that you   re a licensed pilot. How did you  become interested in flying?  That   s another thing I never thought I would do. My husband is a pilot  and has been a pilot for a number of years. After I started flying with  him, I thought,    I kept hearing all these stories about how maybe a wife  or a significant other was with a pilot and he had a heart attack or  something happened, and this person wasn   t able to land the plane.    So  I thought,    I should figure out how to fly this airplane in case anything  ever happens to him.     I started ground school and went to ground school, and I   ll have to be  honest with you, about the second or third night of ground school I  decided I couldn   t do this. I decided I wasn   t smart enough to get  through ground school. And I went home and told my husband and said     I can   t finish this. I can   t do the weather stuff, I   m not a mechanic, just  the whole thing around doing the flight check on the airplane and all  20  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  that, I just don   t think I can do it.    Well, bottom line is, I ended up doing  it and then ended up getting my license, and then once I got my license, I  was the one who always wanted to fly the airplane, and he never could  get the airplane back. So it was really just to make sure that I could land  the plane in case anything ever happened, but I love it. I love the feeling  of being up there alone and being a free spirit. It   s just really a  phenomenal feeling.  What   s the coolest place you   ve ever flown to?  I guess it would be flying to Gulf Shores, Alabama, which is just outside  Pensacola, Florida. We have a place there and so it   s an interesting flight  in that, that part of the world there   s a lot of fog, there   s a lot of haze,  and so, you really have to be on top of your game in going in to that part  of the world. And flying over water, flying over Mobile Bay, I mean all  of those are touchy little things. But every time you go up in an airplane,  you really take your life in your own hands. I think when you go out and  get in the car perhaps you   re taking your life into your own hands.  Maybe when you walk across the street you   re taking your life into your  own hands. You know people who say,    Well I just don   t know, I don   t  think planes are safe and they scare me        Do you fly often?  I used to fly a lot. I don   t fly as much as I used to. We would fly just  about everywhere we went. I love the general aviation people and that  community. We   re all kindred spirits and we really enjoy what we   re  doing. I was a part of the Ninety-Nines which is Amelia Earhart   s  organization that she established. There   s a great Ninety-Nines Chapter  here in Oklahoma City. We would all get together often times on  Saturday morning and fly to a small runway somewhere and we   d paint  the numbers. Our job was to help the airport out and there   d be six or  seven of us that would fly in, land and paint the numbers at the end of  the runway. And just a lot of great camaraderie and terrific women in the  Ninety-Nines who celebrated Amelia Earhart for what she did and for  her passion and her record breaking flights. It   s just truly a great  organization to be a part of and I   m really proud to be a pilot.  What is next on the agenda for Terry Neese? What do you think you   ll be  doing in the next few years?  Well, God only knows, but I think I will be continuing to help women  around the world. I think I will get deeper into that. This year is really  just a test of   can we really be helpful to women in Afghanistan and can  we provide follow up to them next year, when they go back home and  continue to build their businesses. I see us also helping women in India,  21  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  China, Mexico, South Africa, and women business owners here in the  United States who are trying to grow their companies.  We   ve come, women business owners have come a long way over the  last thirty-five years   a long way. We still have a long way to go. Many  women business owners are highly qualified to sit on Fortune 500  Boards of Director   s and we   re not there. We need to be out advocating  for that. Women business owners that are trying to take their business to  the next level, need women business owner mentors that are already at  that next level that will walk back down the ladder and work with their  other fellow women business owners and help pull them up that other  ladder, the rest of that ladder. So we need to be helping women here but  we need to be helping women around the globe.  I also believe we need to elect more and more women to office. Not just  because they are a woman, but elect women that are passionate about  your views and that you believe will represent you well, and that you are  comfortable with them representing you well in office. Let me digress  and say, when I ran for lieutenant governor in 1990, we had women in  this state when I would hand them my campaign literature they wouldn   t  take it from me. And they would say to me,    Women are not supposed  to run for office.    That was in 1990. So, we need to help women  understand that women bring a different perspective to the table. They  bring a different voice to the table. They bring different color to the  table. And so, it   s important that we have a table that looks like  America. Women make up 54  of the electorate, so having only 14  in  the United States Senate is unconscionable. And we can find good,  qualified women to be in these offices. Not just because they   re a  woman, but because they   re qualified. So I see myself, continuing to  voice those opinions, and continuing to help women around the world.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  Oh, she was a crazy woman from Cookietown who didn   t know how to  stop. She worked 24/7. She was passionate about women and passionate  about making sure that women had a seat at the table and women were  this and women were that and it was this women thing  I   m hopeful that  they will say that I did help women a lot, that I helped them in their  careers initially, that I found jobs for thousands of women, who then  progressed up the ladder, and then I helped women start businesses, be  self sufficient, have freedom, have independence not only here in the  United States and here in Oklahoma, but around the globe. I think that   s  a pretty good history.  Oh yes, that   s not a bad way to be remembered.  22  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  Nykolaiszyn  Neese  I think it   s a good way to be remembered.  Is there anything you   d like to add that we have not spoken about today?  I can   t think of anything.  Well we definitely appreciate you taking time out of your schedule to  meet with us. It   s been a pleasure interviewing you.  It   s been a pleasure to talk with you and to kind of go back through life.  You know, the problem about going back through life is that you get  very emotional about what happened to you when you were growing  up    things that you haven   t thought about for a long time. So it   s been  a good review for me and I appreciate you, I appreciate the Hall of  Fame, I appreciate the women who are there, and I thank you for the  opportunity.  -------  -------
