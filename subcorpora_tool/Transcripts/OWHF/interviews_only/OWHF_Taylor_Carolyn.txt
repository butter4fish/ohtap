 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Friday, September 14th and I am in Tulsa, Oklahoma  interviewing Dr. Carolyn Taylor. This interview is being conducted as  part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral  History Project. Dr. Taylor was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s  Hall of Fame in 2007. She is a former member of the Oklahoma House  of Representatives, serving from 1984 to 1992. While in the House, she  championed a variety of important issues affecting women and their  families. Dr. Taylor is a Professor of Political Science at Rogers State  University. Her areas of academic specialty include American federal,  state, and local government. Thank you for joining us today.  Thanks, Juliana.  Let   s begin by learning a little more about you. Could you start with  where you grew up and give a little background on your early life.  Certainly. I was born in Norman, Oklahoma and I lived there my entire  life until 1992 when I moved to Claremore, Oklahoma. It was a great  place to grow up. A small university town at the time, it   s not very small  now. But it was still very small. Everyone knew everybody kind of  place. All my relatives on both sides of my family were there and lots of  cousins and grandparents and siblings. I   m the oldest of five children  and graduated from Norman High School.  Of course, and I hate to tell anyone this from OSU  Oklahoma State  University , but when you   re from Norman you don   t think there is  anywhere else to go except the University of Oklahoma  OU . So I  earned my bachelor   s degree in American history, continued working on  my master   s while I was hired to teach government   AP Government at  Norman High School where I had just graduated from and was working  there, teaching, living.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  I was always interested in politics of course, loved that. Then the  incumbent state representative at the time   very popular Cleta  Deatherage Mitchell decided not to run for re-election at kind of the last  minute in 1984, which was my third or fourth year of teaching at the  high school. I   d always dreamed of doing that one day but not when I  was twenty-seven years old. But a lot of people encouraged me to go try  it. At the time, that summer I had been awarded a Fulbright Scholarship  to study politics and history in the Middle East. I had to choose between  doing that and running for office. It was kind of a hard call. But I ended  up turning down the scholarship and knocking doors instead in 105  degree heat for three or four months.  The election turned out fine, probably because most of my relatives  voted for me. I don   t know if all of them did but   and former students. I  had a pretty good base with education, with teachers and the university  community. Education, of course, was my platform and what I cared  about the most. So I enjoyed that. I had to quit my job of course, and go  to Oklahoma City now and serve in the legislature and became active in  education there.  I continued to work at going to school at night on my master   s degree  and finish that in political science. And then, I started working on my  doctorate. In 1992, I decided not to run for re-election   just was tired  and decided to get married to a guy who lives in Claremore. So I moved  to Claremore and began teaching. Actually, I worked here at this campus   OSU-Tulsa  when it was the University Center at Tulsa for a while in  administration. Then when UCT and Rogers State University split, I  decided to go to the Claremore campus, since I lived there. We had two  small children by then and it was just a lot easier. I ended up finishing  my doctorate at Oklahoma State University, your institution. I had  finished really all of my hours but my dissertation and it was just easier  to commute to Stillwater and to here  Tulsa  to meet with my committee  than to go to Norman and OSU was great. They took all of my hours. So  I really have nothing bad to say about Oklahoma State University. It   s an  excellent institution. I   m proud to have degrees from both state-wide  universities.  When you were younger, describe for me the schools you were  attending. What were they like? Were there a lot of students there?  I went from the first grade to the fifth grade at a private, Catholic school.  Our family is very much involved with St. Joseph   s Catholic Church and  at the time they had a parochial school so I went there until the fifth  grade when the school closed for lack of enrollment and financial  problems. Then I went into the public school system from the sixth  grade to the twelfth grade. I think that   s been a huge advantage having a  6  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  little bit of both backgrounds. And then, of course, the Catholic school  was a very small environment. We were taught by the nuns and all that.  Public school was huge compared to where I had been, but that was a  good experience too. And I   m the oldest of five kids. I think that played  a role in being a little bit more aggressive or being the first one to try  things, I don   t know.  So when you were younger, what were some of your favorite subjects in  school? Were you geared more toward the history or did you say,     Forget this   I   m math and science all the way.     Oh gosh, that is so funny because I was always social studies   that was  my thing, and history. Of course, my first degree was in history. But I  loved government. I fell in love with my high school government  teacher, who was an old spinster woman, Mrs. Viola Smith. I just always  wanted to be like her when I grew up. It   s ironic, I got her job at the high  school when she retired. She sort of timed her retirement so I could step  in. I was her student aid in high school and she really turned me on, I  think, to government and public service. It was nice to have the  opportunity to honor her at the state capital one day for all she had done.  Now I am spending every evening of my life tutoring my son in pre-algebra  who is a seventh grader. And so I   m learning algebra quickly  and it   s not so bad, I kind of like it. All my brothers and my father are  engineers and you know, you take all those aptitude tests I think in  junior high and high school, I   m sure you did too. And they tell you  what you should be or what career paths perhaps you ought to think  about. I was always directed toward the engineering, science and the  math but I had no interest in it. I always wanted to do the other, the  social sciences and history, the political science.  It   s funny how that comes back around.  How about that  (Laughter)  When you were younger, outside of school, what did you like to do for  fun?  Go to the library. My mother would always take us to the library for  story hour and the library always had lots of cool programs. That and the  other thing I remember going to a lot was the University of Oklahoma  now, it   s huge, the Museum of National History which I was happy to  play a large role in getting funding for their building. But before they  were in their current facility, they were in this little dump on campus  that was known as the Stovall Museum. It   s where all the old dinosaur  bones and all the collections of Indian things, and we would all go there  7  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  a lot and hang out. It was really fun. And my grandparents    farm, I  remember spending a lot of time there.  What was your favorite part about the farm?  Oh my gosh, we got to ride the cows. My grandparents would always  name a cow for every grandchild. So of course, I was always partial to  the cow, Carolyn, (Laughs) which was born on or near my birthday,  that   s how it got its name. And fishing, we got to go fishing all the time.  But I   m pretty much a city girl.  Now when you were younger, did you envision yourself becoming a  teacher or a politician? What did you want to be when you were  younger?  A lawyer. I had always dreamed of going to law school. After I finished  my bachelor   s degree, I thought,    Gosh it would be fun to teach for a  year or two and then I   ll go back to law school.    But I never made it. I  enjoy teaching so much and I   ve found that is my true passion.  Now you are the oldest of five children, tell me a little about your  family? And how important your family is in your life, then and now.  Oh gosh, I guess it   s just always been the center of my life. We are a  very close family, a large Catholic family. I guess we always did so  many things together. I have lots of fond memories of family vacations  and so many activities with extended family members   cousins, nieces  and nephews. They were all so great when I would run for office. It was  just this huge family effort. You know, it   s   my aunts loved to paint the  big signs and put the glue on the paper and build them. My dad and  brothers, they would be the sign crew and they   d go put out all the little  yard signs and big signs. My dad was still healthy enough back then, he  even bought this moped. And of course it   s the engineer in him   he had  this map of Norman where every yard sign was supposed to be. He  would go out on his moped every night and check all the locations and if  the sign had been destroyed or taken because it shouldn   t have been, he  would replace it. That was nice.  Now both sides of your family, your mom and your dad   s side, are they  Oklahoma natives?  Yes, I   m a fifth generation Oklahoman. My great-great-great-grandfather  made the land run into Oklahoma territory   long history in  the state, both sides of the family.  Now you attended the University of Oklahoma for your undergraduate  8  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  degree, what was it like? Was it a hard transition, since you were from  the area just to shoot on over to Norman?  It was more like an extension of high school really, because Norman     my graduating class at Norman High School it was 600 people in it so  moving on to OU was not   so many kids then, we were even taking the  concurrent enrollment and my classmates were kids of professors. I  think it   s different now, a much smaller environment. And most kids  from Norman High of course went on to OU and we   d see each other  and living in that town your whole life, it just wasn   t that big a deal.  Now OU has gotten so huge and Norman   it   s, gosh, the third largest  city in Oklahoma now. It   s more than doubled in size from when I grew  up. It   s just a very different place.  What types of activities were you involved in as an undergraduate?  Student government, of course, the Student Government Association.  The band, I was a member of the Pride of Oklahoma. I got to go to  several of the bowl games and that was fun. I spent a lot of my time, of  course, doing that. I was pretty bad because when it came time to march  in the Orange Bowl Parade, they didn   t want me to play my instrument  of course. So I got to carry the banner at the very beginning so I  wouldn   t make any noise. (Laughs)  What instrument did you play?  Flute and piccolo, so that   s a good thing, it wasn   t very   when I messed  up, not too many people could hear me.  I   m from Miami and it   s a shame because the parade is no more.  Oh, that   s too bad.  It was always a big deal. Now after Norman, after OU, you   d become a  teacher and you replaced one of your instructors who mentored you  along the way. How did that all transpire?  I was a student teacher for her so I got to know, of course, the  administration and fellow teachers. Of course, many of them had been  my high school teachers and so when it came time to fill the vacancy  when Mrs. Smith retired, I think I probably had an inside track because  they knew me and they had watched me as a student and then a student  teacher. They knew how much I really wanted that job and I vowed to  follow in her footsteps. So that was really great.  So it was a good fit? It wasn   t awkward at all?  9  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  It really was. The only awkward thing about it was that I wasn   t that  much older than the students and finding a way to separate myself in  their eyes as their teacher and not as an older brother or sister so much.  But that really wasn   t that big of a deal after awhile.  Now, what did you like most about teaching high school students?  I just think they are fun. They are passionate by that time about usually  subject matter. They are into their new adult beginning phase of their  life. I think that   s what I enjoy about college students now, it   s not that  different. They   re just so interesting and willing to learn and   I   ve  always been lucky about that too because the Government AP class was  an elective class, they weren   t forced to be there. So everybody was  there because they wanted to be. It was just a positive learning  environment.  After the legislature, you went on, got your master   s degree, your PhD,  taught a little bit here at University Center of Tulsa and you ended up at  Rogers State. Tell me about your time at Rogers State so far. What are  you teaching, what do you like most?  It   s a brand new university in a way, in that in 1999 the legislature made  it a four-year university, a regional university in our state system. Prior  to that it had been a junior college, Claremore Junior College and before  that it was Oklahoma Military Academy. So it   s gone through these  transitions. So I   ve been fortunate to be there as it has grown from a  two-year school into a four-year school. That   s been really nice because  I   ve been on the inside of making that happen.  In addition to my full-time teaching responsibilities and research  responsibilities, I also work part-time for the president as his strategic  initiative coordinator, is what he calls it. But what it really means is just  whatever he needs done. So I   ve been the principal author of the  accreditation transition and the process for writing up reports and getting  us accredited as a four-year institution. I worked on that for several  years. Then I got the opportunity to develop our first strategic plan as a  four-year university and worked on the campus with everyone to put that  together. Now I   m doing the President   s Leadership Class   it   s an  internship program that the President started. So I really like that  because I   m able to keep my feet into two worlds, sort of the academic  side where I really belong, but I also enjoy these administrative  responsibilities as long as there is a beginning and an end to them and  they are not on-going, constant projects. I enjoy being a part of those  kinds of initiatives too.  Do you anticipate, say ten or twenty years down the road, you would  10  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  take more of an administrative role?  Absolutely not. (Laughter) I used to have that goal of being perhaps  university president one day and I   ve seen it up close with two  individuals, President Joe Wiley at Rogers State University and before  that Roger Randal who was the president of what was then here, the  University Center of Tulsa which became OSU  Tulsa campus . And it   s  not what I want to do. It   s too far removed from the classroom, the day-to-  day presidential responsibilities. I don   t think I want to get that far  away from the students. Plus it   s too hard of work. (Laughter)  Some people I   ve interviewed made that transition from being instructor  to college president. They kind of just love it and embrace it but they still  miss, and they still find themselves teaching the classrooms.  Sure.  We learn the background for our careers in many places. Sometimes we  learn it in the classroom, sometimes we learn it on the job. Throughout  your careers, both in the legislature and in the educational world, where  have you learned the most for your career? What are the places you   ve  learned the building blocks you needed for your career?  I don   t think there   s any question of where I learned to be an effective  legislator was my experience in the classroom. I think reaching students  is not that different than reaching legislators. It is largely the ability to  communicate and motivate a group of people to get things done and all  go in the same direction, if possible. And that   s what an effective teacher  does, I think. My training really for politics, I   d say goes back to the  classroom.  My training for the classroom, I don   t know where that came from. I  guess that just must be some sort of innate ability. I don   t know that I  was taught all that much on how to be an instructor. I didn   t go down  that road   I   m not a graduate of the College of Education. I   m a  graduate of the history department and the political science department. I  took enough hours to get a teaching certificate so I never had that much  formal training in being an instructor. And as you know, in higher  education there is no preparation to be in the classroom other than your  discipline in the subject matter. So I   m glad that I had the opportunity to  hone my skills or whatever and practice on high school students before I  moved up to college level.  Tell me about any stumbling blocks or adversity that you   ve faced along  the way.  11  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  I guess in both instances, my age was a hindrance in one respect. When I  was at the high school, as we have already talked about, I was very  young and younger than my coworkers. They, for a while, I   m sure saw  me still as a former student. And so I had to sort of move over to their  side in their minds that I was now a colleague and not a student.  The same thing kind of happened in the legislature. I was twenty-seven  years old when I was first elected. Most of the other people there could  have probably been my grandfathers. I think they saw me more as,    She  could be my granddaughter.    So I never really felt that much of gender  discrimination, I think it was more of an age gap, a generational gap. For  a while we had to learn to work together as equals. That went away  quickly, but it was an initial barrier.  Did you feel when you were in the legislature that you had more of an  advantage because you were from close to Oklahoma City?  No, actually that would have been a disadvantage because the legislature  when I was there was very rurally dominated. And the urban and  suburban representatives were a minority. While I was in the majority  party when I was in the legislature    democrats, that was an advantage  but not being a ruralist democrat was a disadvantage because the  leadership at the time were all rural democrats and here was this young  woman from Norman who they thought you know,    They all think  they   re better than the rest of us, those educated ones   those high-minded,  intellectual liberals,    (Laughs) which of course I   m not but that  was the stereotypical view that they had of someone who would  represent my community.  Can you go into detail about a key moment in your career that you  consider one of your biggest highlights?  Well in my legislative career I think it would be passing several pieces  of legislation that were very important to me. House Bill 1017 comes to  mind, which was a reform education package that ended up going to a  state-wide vote. So I ended up being able to have the opportunity to be  on the part that drafted the legislation and then defending it before the  floor of the House of Representatives. And then I spent quite a bit of  time being asked to promote it on television, debates, radio shows or  speeches across the state when it came before the public. So that was all  very satisfying because it all worked out that it became law and then the  people of Oklahoma upheld that law and now I think it   s seen as a model  across the country in terms of education reform and funding. It was very  cutting edge at the time.  Some other things I   m happy or pleased about was funding the Museum  12  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  of National History in Norman, passing legislation that requires pre-natal  care in Oklahoma or makes it available in all the health  departments. Maternity leave now is granted   family leave for all state  employees, which was important to me at the time. Lots of initiatives     the endowed chair program in higher education and the merit scholar  program in higher education are two things that I was able to  accomplish. So I think passing some major landmark pieces of  legislation that I think has been important to Oklahoma law and turning  points in my legislative career.  In my academic career, I   m really pleased that I have a new book that   s  just been published this month. It   s been a great experience for me  putting together. Boy, was I na  ve about a lot of things about how all  that works. That   s been very rewarding. And then seeing some success  with my students in the classroom, of course, is always of primary  importance.  Tell us a little about your book. What is it called? Give us a little  background.  Sure. It   s called Voices from the Heartland and it   s a collection of essays  from fifty women   Oklahoma women, who have each written personal  stories about their lives as sort of seen through the lens of being an  Oklahoman. They write about what they know now, they wish  somebody would have taught or told them sooner. Sort of passing along  some wisdom narratives and they   re all just amazing. They   re just all  over the map and pretty well known names   Wilma Mankiller, Coach  Sherri Coale at OU, first lady Kim Henry, Congresswoman Mary Fallin,  Miss America Jane Jayroe. But then there   s a lot of people that perhaps  most Oklahomans wouldn   t recognize   nurses and doctors and  ministers and artists and we even found, Oklahoma   s first in the nation  of the number of women incarcerated, so I thought it was important to  get that perspective. We found a female inmate to write about how she  got through it and what it   s like.  Wow.  It   s an official Centennial Project and all proceeds go to the Oklahoma  Women   s Foundation. And I put it together, not by myself, I had three  colleagues that helped me, who are actually English professors, thank  goodness because I   m not that, they did most of the editing. I did the  part of collecting the stories from everyone. The University of  Oklahoma Press published it.  I   m sure all of the stories are your favorite     13  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  They all are.  If you could pick one or two women that just really stand out from the  book, who would they be?  There is no question   Rilla Askew   s essay which we put at the very  front of the book is by far I think the best and stands out above the  others. I kind of hate to say that, but it   s just so extraordinary. You   ll  have to get the book and read it because I couldn   t give it justice in  describing it. But of course, she   s a professional writer and has won  many, many awards so that   s an advantage, of course, that she had. Most  of the people that are in the book are not professional writers, so that  was sort of an interesting and a very pleasing process to see these stories  come in. Coach Coale is a good example. I don   t think anybody   any of  us, I certainly didn   t expect her to be such a talented writer. She writes a  fabulous story and so many of the women did. But Rilla Askew   s just  blows your mind.  Now moving to the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame, when you were  notified that you were going to be inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s  Hall of Fame, tell me what was going through your mind at that time.  Well it was a huge surprise because I didn   t know   actually the  president of the university, Joe Wiley, had nominated me and he didn   t  tell me. And so I had no idea when this woman called and said,     Congratulations, you   ve been awarded notification or whatever and  you   re to be inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame.    That  was just a nice surprise and I was honored that he had thought of me to  do that and second, I know almost all those other women that are in that  Hall of Fame and it   s just such an honor to be included with them.  Do you remember who presented you at the ceremony?  I asked President Wiley to present me. I felt so honored that he had spent  his time nominating me and we   ve worked closely together for the last  six or seven years on so many things. And so, I wanted him to do that.  Can you tell me what this type of honor means to you?  Well, I think it doesn   t mean that much to me personally. What it means  is that, to me   that the purpose of the award is to honor and spotlight, I  guess, women who have achieved some success in their lives or made a  difference. The fact that the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame is able to  do that and to identify such outstanding   not me, but all those other  people   recipients, I think has so many consequences in terms of  providing role models for other people, highlighting successful women.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  You know, that kind of goes back to the reason that I put that book  together, is that there   s just not much recognition, I don   t think, or there  doesn   t seem to be, of the role that women have played in our state. You  look at the statistics and they   re not good. High levels of poverty and  teen pregnancy and divorce, incarceration and yet there are these  outstanding women in our state. We know they   re out there, and the  Women   s Foundation and the Hall of Fame group recognizes that and  they choose to put a spotlight on these women and that was one of the  purposes of our book, is to do the same thing. And that really   to start a  dialogue, I hope, is to how is it that a state where conditions are not  hospitable to women in so many ways, can still produce women of such  outstanding character and achievement.  How is it we can have America   s Idol come from this state and a record  number of Miss America   s and women who contribute in every field.  Yet the conditions in which they grew up often time aren   t very  supportive. And so that disconnect, you know, was the reason we wrote  the book. I think the same thing is why the Women   s Foundation and the  Hall of Fame is important because I think they   re trying to do the same  thing as well. Maybe the efforts of all these things will make this state  start to recognize and think about how is it we can do better and help  more girls and women and young boys succeed as well. So that   s why  this award is important to me.  Well you   ve touched many people in the classroom and you   ve touched  many people as a legislator, how do you feel that now people look at you  as a role model?  Well, I don   t know. My husband always says one of the things that  always amazed him about me is that   I don   t like to talk about myself.  So these are his words, he always says,    I can somehow get people to do  things that they maybe wouldn   t normally want to do.    I look back at  what I was able to accomplish in the legislature and the classroom or this  year as PTO President of my kids    school and I guess there   s some truth  to that but I have no idea how it happens.  Would you like to say anything about the people who   ve helped play an  important role in your life?  Oh, I think there   s just been so many that we   d be here all week. My  family, of course, played an important role early on. My colleagues in  the legislature, I think, were all very supportive and were so helpful to  me in a number ways in getting things done, colleagues at the university  now, and of course my own family   my husband and my two kids. I  guess I   ve just always been very lucky to have such supportive  environment wherever I   ve been.  15  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  If you could give any piece of advice to your fellow Oklahomans, what  would you tell them?  Oh, that   s a hard one too. I guess when I look back on all these things  that you   ve brought up   being in the legislature, or being in the  classroom, or publishing a book, or finishing a dissertation   I don   t see  those things as being big deals. I see them as a million little pieces.  Becoming an elected representative, to me, is nothing but   when I look  at that, hours and hours of knocking on thousands of doors. Working on  your dissertation or finishing your degree, is just going to this class and  then that class and finishing this paper and then another paper. It   s just a  thousand little pieces. The same thing with teaching   putting together  lectures and making up classroom work is just hundreds of just tiny  items that all get rolled together into something. I guess my best advice  to anybody, and I even tell my students this, break it down into the  smallest unit and have a goal in mind, but then break it down as little as  you can and then take those individual steps and before you know it,  you   re there.  Now, what would you tell a woman who plans to either go to the  legislature or go to the classroom, do you have any words of wisdom?  Well, I   ve worked with lots of women who   ve thought about running for  office. I don   t quite understand it, but they often say,    I just can   t do  that. I don   t have the skills or I don   t have the money or I don   t think I  know how to do it.    And that   s just nuts because most women are doing  all the things every day that it takes to be a successful teacher or to be,  certainly, an elected representative and that   s just getting people to be  able to communicate, which women are great at, to be able to organize a  project and get it done, to be able to work well with others. And it   s just  things that you   re probably doing already within your family as a mother  or as a person in a profession and those skills still transfer into the  legislature and political environment and into the classroom.  When history is written about you, and I know you   ve been asked this  question in other interviews, what would you like for it to say?  I don   t remember what I said in those other interviews so I hope it   s  consistent. (Laughter) I guess the most important thing to me is that I   m  a good mom right now and that I made a difference in my outside the  family endeavors, whether it be politics or in the classroom. I think  history will show I did.  What does, as a native Oklahoman, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Gosh, it   s just such a special thing. I think to me, it means that it   s  16  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  Taylor  Nykolaiszyn  unique and different, both in good and not so flattering ways. But  somehow the combination of all that good and bad and uniqueness is  something that makes me feel unique. And I would hope every  Oklahoman would feel special because I think our state is very special.  It   s 2007, right now you   re in the classroom. What do you anticipate  doing in the next say 20 years, where do you envision yourself being?  I tell you putting this book together has opened a new world for me. I   d  like to do some more of that. I hope there are other volumes of the book  that continue after this one. We   ve organized it, the project in a way with  the website and some other things to make that happen and let other  women tell their stories. So I hope we have a series that begins and that I  can be heavily involved in. If it   s a success in Oklahoma, I tell you it  would just be a dream to work with other states and do something very  similar and have a Voices of Nebraska, or Voices of Texas, or Voices of  California and let women in those states put together an anthology that  kind of describes their perspectives. That would be really neat. I don   t  aspire to be on Oprah, but that would be fun. I guess more than anything  right now on my mind, is getting all these scrapbooks made of my kids     lives that are sitting in shoeboxes all over my dining room table right  now.  And how old are your children?  Well, I hate to tell you this, they   re 12 and 13 and I still haven   t put any  books together in terms of photos but it   s all there   the material is there.  Is there anything else that you would like to add that we haven   t touched  upon?  I think you   ve covered a great amount of material. No, thanks.  Well we do appreciate you taking time out to meet with us today.  My pleasure.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
