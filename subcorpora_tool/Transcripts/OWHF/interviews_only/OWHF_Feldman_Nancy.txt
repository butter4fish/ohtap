 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Wednesday, March 19, 2008 and I am in Tulsa,  Oklahoma interviewing Nancy Feldman. This interview is being  conducted as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame oral history project. Nancy was inducted into the Oklahoma  Women   s Hall of Fame in 1995. Thank you for joining us today.  Thank You.  Let us begin by learning a little more about you. Could you tell us where  you grew up and give us some insight into your early life?  Yes, I had a very good early life which I am sure I draw upon a lot. Two  very loving parents happily married, a younger brother, who was a pest  and an older sister who was a model  of how not to behave ; (Laughs)  standard thing. I grew up in a suburb of Chicago. And it was a kind of  unique suburb. It had a really fine John Dewey school. And my father     I doubt many know about the class of    13 at the University of Chicago  but that was my father   s class and a whole bunch of them, knowing each  other, moved to Highland Park because the schools were so good and  they wanted   when they had children   to have their children in good  schools. So I grew up with this kind of amazing group of people who  had gone to college with my parents, all of whom we called    Aunt    and     Uncle.    And all of whom had total control over us. (Laughter) So you  never could do anything without somebody   s mother feeling that she  was your mother as well.  And so, Jo, Jean, Betty, Rose Carol, Janie and I grew up. We later called  ourselves the Five Funny Freaks and our motto was    God helps those  who help themselves over a candy counter.    (Laughs) So it was this very  warm, loving   kind of a fairy tale childhood that we all shared together  and everyone had done pretty well financially. We went to this amazing  school that had a telescope and observatory and we went on nature  5  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  walks, lots of nature walks. I guess this was really so formative for me.  Our principal was named Mr.  Jesse Lowe  Smith. And I remember my  sister coming back from college or going for a job in Washington said,     You know what counted most? That I had gone to Elm Place Grammar  School. My college years weren   t as important as that I   ve gone to that  elementary school.     It was a school where you learned by doing. We never learned the math  tables or anything. We had a store. (Laughter) We made change and we  did a lot of things with our hands. And the girls and the boys took wood  working. We didn   t have any home ec. (Laughter) I am severely  deficient in the home ec and I think my family has starved. My mother  didn   t know how to cook. My grandmother didn   t know how to cook.  And I like to just throw something together. We were not taught the  womanly arts. My mother taught me embroidery but I never learned how  to sew on a button, hem a skirt. This school, Elm Place, was  kindergarten through eighth grade. And we all went to nursery school  together. One year we had our fiftieth nursery school reunion. So it was  this very close group. It has its downside. You learned that you better get  along. At times when I didn   t, I felt it.  And our families were all kind of    the same, all Christian, Episcopal,  or Presbyterian except for mine, which was Jewish. But none of us went  to church or Sunday school regularly. I sang in the Episcopal choir  because I liked that. But none of us had the usual heavy molding of  religion. Our parents were all in a group together that lasted for hundreds  of years I think. It didn   t have a name, or at least that I didn   t know. But  they had dinner together one Sunday night a month and they had a  University of Chicago professor come out and talk about comparative  religions. Religion was important as a subject but ethics were much  more important and emphasized. This is going in places I did not know  it was going to go.  No, that   s fine, trust me.  And then, when we were in    I guess our freshman year in high school,  it developed into a group of kids. We met one Sunday night a month and  had a young student from Meadville Theological Seminary come out  and talk to us and then we had dinner. And just to tie my life together, a  little, when we came here to Tulsa, we became friends with the  Unitarian Minister Bob Sonen and his wife, Olive. And one night we  were over there to dinner and Bob was telling about his studies at  Meadville. And he said he was always hungry.    I just never had enough  money to fill myself up. But I went to this group of really dumb kids  who had no interest in this at all but they had a Sunday night meeting  and I would come and talk to them and then I   d have dinner with them.  6  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  They had this wonderful dinner and they would load me up with food  which would last for me a week.    I said,    Oh Bob, that   s funny. I  belonged to a group like that and we had this very dull guy come out.  And we were all pretty good students and we just didn   t think he ever  cut it.    And suddenly we realized    (Laughter)  It was him   And he said,    But you were all so ignorant, not smart at all.    I said,    Let  me just tell you about what happened to them.    Carol Binder is Foreign  Editor of the Chicago Daily News, Lenny Reser is Editor of the Atomic  Research Bulletin and I began telling him what happened to these kids  that were so dumb. And I said,    And here you are the most wonderful  minister I can have possibly imagined     (Laughter)  It is a small world.  It is a small world. So, it was funny. But our parents were very eager  that we had a broad view of religion, I guess.    Cause we must have had  it, I think we all had very strong moral senses. I can remember many  instances when particularly Jo Lloyd and I said,    We won   t do that. No  dirty jokes.    (Laughter) Prissy little prim pots. But, I think we all had  this strong feeling of this is what you do and this is what don   t do. Very  old fashioned nowadays.  Were your parents very encouraging when it came to education?  Oh yes, there was no question. I was going to an eastern women   s  college, and several of the mothers and my mother   s close cousins had  gone to such schools. My older sister was very boy crazy in high school.  So she was immediately yanked out of high school and sent to a private  girl   s school as a day student. But she did not do particularly well and  she did not get into one of the right colleges. And I often wonder how  much my sister   s example, I adored my sister until I was about ten, I  guess, and then I began thinking,    What is she doing? She is plucking  her eyebrows and wearing lipstick and failing English.    (Laughter) And  it was prohibition times and she had a little hip flask.  Wow   I really disapproved of her. And I think it was a wonderful influence.  (Laughter) I studied   I didn   t study hard but I got good grades.  The  school  had a wonderful vocational school because Highland Park has  kind of a little oasis of college bound people. Among more craft and  skilled bound people, our high school built a house every year. And they  learned to do the electric work, the carpentry work, the painting. It was  7  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  really a good school for them. Very high. We were over   I did not  realize this until I went to a reunion, we were about 55  Italian   first  generation. But we, in our own little worlds, were in a private session  and we went to our college bound classes which no one else was in. It  was a very strange world, as I look back on it. Our fathers all commuted  and went into Chicago to work. And I guess it was   I now realize it was  very odd   singular   but wonderfully nourishing to me.  What were some of your favorite subjects?  I adored math. I was really good at math. And in high school, Latin was  by far my favorite subject. Our Latin teacher was just extraordinary. I  actually was sent to another high school out of the district for my  freshman and sophomore years because my parents felt Highland Park  High was not good, judging from my sister   s performance there, they did  not want me to get into that route  Going to a new school was hard, and I  didn   t know anyone. It was a huge school and here I have been brought  up with this tiny circle and I was not very well prepared to stretch out.  My parents took my sister to Europe because she was getting in trouble  and they wanted to get her out of the country and I was starting high  school.  That   s a good punishment.  My mother was a Montessori teacher and had thought I should go to  Catholic high school, Sacred Heart, as it was a better school. I went  three days and decided that was not for me. And my mother left a  message that if I did want to change (we had someone living with us to  take care of us) I could go to New Trier. So I went to New Trier, but I  had no admissions tests and I didn   t realize it was a school where you   re  streamed according to your abilities. And so I started in the slightly  retarded level. (Laughter) You call it    x    classes. I didn   t know what    x     meant. But I thought these were pretty dumb classes. And then within  three or four days, I was put in the normal. And then I was put in the  accelerated. And then they decided to give me a test and they put me in  the experimental. So that within three weeks, I   d been through four  complete changes of classes except for gym. I wonder looking back how  chaotic this was. It was probably pretty good for me. But it didn   t feel it  (Laughter) at the time. As soon as I tentatively start talking to someone I  was in another class.  My father had a seat on the Chicago Board of Trade. He was not a  broker but he invested his own money. And this was very good for me,  very good. I am always glad about it. We lived very, very well. We had  a great big house but sometimes we were really poor. And we had to  really watch. I remember having dreams about getting stockings that that  8  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  didn   t have snags and runs in them and being able to buy clothes instead  of wearing hand-me-downs from my cousin in St. Louis, and yet we  lived pretty grandly but with all these little pinching economies at home.  My mother was usually home in the afternoons when we got home from  school we would have tea and embroider and talk. I remember one time  she just had been looking at Vogue and she said,    Now look at this  woman. Look at these women, they all have the finest clothes, the most  stylish clothes you can imagine. Look at their mouths, they are all turned  down. These are not happy women. It   s not clothes and money that   s  going to make you happy.    I can remember that word for word.  We were brought up with material goods but with a pretty strong ethic  that that is not what counts. I remember when our son was growing up  and he wanted to go to Orbach   s here. He felt he could only buy clothes  at Orbach   s, of course. And Raymond   s brother had a store, kind of like   JC  Penney   s in Kansas. I said,    If you have really good taste you could  go to Uncle Herman   s and pick out clothes and look just like you would  from Orbach   s, unless you are so dependent on label.    I think that was a  pretty strong message in my childhood. Anyway, me and my friends all  got through and kept these very strong, very supportive most of the time  friendships. Unless, Jo and I were being too prissy and judgmental.  (Laughs)  Well, that   s a great support system through the years, I am sure.  It is, it is. In fact, I got a   I am opening mail because we were gone for  so long   I got one from my OLF   my    oldest living friend,    Janie  Selfridge. Well, Janie   s mother and my mother lived across the street  from each other in Chicago. And, I think this must have happened when  they were wheeling us in buggies. They   d meet on the street.    Slim  Selfridge   Slim Adams then   my oldest living friend  Irene Kesner, my  oldest living friend     And they went on for years. Ended up in the  hospital together   still being oldest living friends. And Janie and I  would say,    This is just awful. This is disgusting.    (Laughter) And then  one time, we were meeting in Washington and I could see her coming  from a distance, and I said,    Janie, my oldest living friend     She was  saying the same thing. I mean we are oldest living friends. Our mothers  were pregnant together and it   s just so odd that all of these people who  were in college together proceeded to have little girls my age. No little  boys, which was pretty bad. (Laughs)  Well, when you were growing up, outside of school, what did you like to  do for fun?  Well, I loved Girl Scouts. I was a Brownie. And then it was Depression  time and my mother and one of her friends took the job of Director of  9  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  the Council together   they couldn   t raise the money to have a Girl  Scout professional. So they did it, they worked it full time between them  and they ran Girl Scouting and the Moraine Council of Girl Scouts. I  loved Girl Scouting. It was a big influence on me. It taught me so much;  whatever I know how to cook was from Girl Scouts. I went to Girl Scout  camp and when I went to a private girl scout camp later, I did not think it  was nearly as much fun because everything was done for you, whereas  we were doing it ourselves. And so Girl Scouts was a big influence.  I was very athletic. My sister was a super athlete. My parents were pretty  athletic. We belonged to a country club. And we swam a lot. We ice  skated every afternoon. We sledded. We went bobsledding at night. We  had a big wooden bobsled that you pulled behind a car. And we were  expected to be good sports. If you hurt yourself, you did not cry.  (Laughs) And oddly enough, partly because the man who taught  swimming and diving at our club was, I thought, pretty attractive, so I  was over there practicing diving all the time and he entered me in a  competition and I won. And then I won AAU. And then he said,    You  are off for the Olympics.    I really thought I was. It was 1937. I worked  hard at it. I am good at taking orders, particularly from a very cute  young man. (Laughs) If he said to do something, I did it. So I was  learning gainers, you know what a gainer is?  I do not.  You walk out on a board forward like this    jump and then go back,  instead of going forward.  Okay.  And he said,    You are way out.    I was out on a ten foot board, a three  meter board. And he said,    You   ve got to feel like you   re going to hit  the board.    So, I hit the board. I went hurtling into the pool. And he said,     Get back up there     And I did. I   d broken my back.  Oh, my goodness   No more Olympics. Actually that was    38 because     How old were you?     39. I was sixteen.  And you broke your back at sixteen?  Yeah     10  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Ughhh     But then it was really one of those semi-good things because I was  always torn. Was I going to be a scholar or was I going to be an athlete?  You could not do both. I was wobbling and I got into every college I  applied to. I didn   t realize that I was not a cocky child. When I came  home on April 15th there were all these big fat letters from Vassar,  Smith, Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, and Radcliffe. And I sat on the floor and  I cried. I said,    They sent back everything I sent to them.    My mother  said,    Why don   t you open one?    (Laughs) And I had been admitted. I  never describe myself as secure. Yet, when I looked back I think I must  have been more secure than I thought I was. I think I had that usual  adolescent insecurity    I was not a pretty girl and I wasn   t cute. With  boys, I always had a date, but it wasn   t one of the glamour boys.  (Laughs) And it wasn   t three months ahead. But the back thing made it  very easy. I was not going to be able to be a diver. So then now I was  going to have to be a scholar.  When you got these letters from all these different colleges, where did  you end up going?  I ended up going to Vassar. My mother had two cousins that were like  sisters to her   she did not have a sister   and they had both gone to  Vassar. My parents took me east, we went to look at all the colleges  before this   before I applied   and they all looked wonderful to me.  And they all are. But I think I went there because my cousin Dorothy  went there. Her daughter Betty and I were the same age but she was  artistic, not academic.  What was that experience like for you?  It was very    strange. I came from a public school. And I was going east  to school. I was a Jewish girl with no Jewish background and not used to  being discriminated against, and I was given a Jewish roommate, whom  I did not know, who was raised completely differently from me. Her first  question was   I didn   t know what she meant, so I will say it the way she  said it to me      What kind of    chubby    do you have?    And I said,     What   s a    chubby   ?    And she said,    A fur coat, a short fur coat     And I  was so turned off. I said,    None     In those days, every girl had one and I  did not. But I was so put off by this. This was her first question to me   Not    What are you majoring in?    Or    Where do you come from?        What kind of a chubby do you have?    (Laughs) Pretty early into the  semester, she found another roommate, moved out. We had a three room  suite for two so I had it for myself.  But I felt very discarded even though I didn   t like her and we didn   t fit  11  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  together at all. I felt pretty dumped. Luckily, I got to know the other  girls on my floor. And we had a very good time, but I felt insecure a lot  of the time. Girls would say,    Where did you prepare?    with their  Eastern accents from preparatory school. (Laughs)    I went to Highland  Park High School.    And a lot of them knew each other. I knew one girl.  I didn   t even realize it for a couple of months until we ran into each  other on campus. I had gone to camp with her. It was hard. I started  going to chapel very regularly thinking deeply about life and its meaning  for me. I loved singing in the choir. I went to everything there was on  the campus. I went to every lecture and concert. (Laughs) Art show. I  tell you that when we graduated from high school, the teachers did a  take-off on us. Am I rambling too much?  No. You are fine.  Well, the teacher who wore my clothes and was me drew great hilarity.  All she did was walk across the stage carrying a pile of books because I  never studied in high school, I never studied. In English class, when we  were given an assignment, I   d write it in class and hand it in. And I just  thought, I don   t need to study. But at Vassar, I found at the end of the  first semester that I had a C minus average. (Laughs) And I was going to  be asked to leave. I was asked to keep a time chart of every fifteen  minutes in a day. And we were supposed to do two hours of home study  for every hour in class which would have been forty-five hours a week,  including your class and the two hours. I was doing like seventeen.  (Laughs) But loving it  I was just agog with all the stuff going on. But I  had to trim my sails and really study and I just adored it.  You know in my next life, I think want to be a researcher. I love  spending time in the library and getting into things deeply. And I had  extraordinarily good teachers, I think. I can look back on certain  incidents that happened, for example, reading Virginia Wolfe   s essay  Two Guineas about women, and A Room of One   s Own. That just  refocused me, and I began thinking about careers. I mean, really big  time. I have probably the only total collection of Virginia Wolfe first  editions simply because that   s what I could buy at the time. (Laughs) I  wasn   t looking for first editions. I just bought everything Virginia Wolfe  wrote. Have you read Virginia Wolfe?  I have.  It just threw me into understanding how much women could do if they  worked at it. And I also remember my history teacher, a little old lady,  just very politely chewing me out in class. And I must have just looked  devastated. And she said,    Miss Goodman, He whom the Lord loveth, he  chastiseth.    And I became a really good student because I loved it. But  12  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  those teachers wangled me into it.  What was your major?  I started out majoring in music. I thought I was going to be a great  composer. I couldn   t be a great pianist or a violinist. And I realized I  wasn   t that good but I was pretty good. Well being there with real  competition, I realized I didn   t have it. At the same time, I realized that I  adored economics. I adored psychology. I adored sociology. I want to  leave music  (Laughs) And it was one of those easy transitions. If I  would say I have a gift, I think it   s flexibility. I can go from being a  diver, I can go from being a musician, and that may be because I give up  too quickly on other things. I mean that same flexibility is a two way  street. I maybe don   t persevere and work as hard as I could on things.  But I feel pretty passionate about changing the world. And I feel as  though moving to Tulsa gave me an opportunity that I would never have  had in a big city like Chicago to see a problem, get a little group around  it, and get something done.  Give me some examples.  Okay, well my most recent is getting the arts back into the public  schools. I was chairing a national meeting on aesthetics in education,  and I came home from the meeting thinking,    We don   t have that in  Tulsa.    We took two of our children out of public school because we felt  that they were getting such a poor education. Without much thought I  went to the phone and called the superintendent who at that time was  named John Thompson, our first Black superintendent. We   d met him at  a couple of parties. I called for an appointment and his secretary said,     You can have fifteen minutes on such and such date,    about two or  three days out. So I worked hard on pulling together a convincing  presentation of why the arts made a difference to all children in a public  school. And that the impact on low income children was probably higher  than it was on high income high achieving children because they already  had arts in their lives. And that for children who didn   t come from an  academic background, to have something that relieved them during  school that they can be good at was probably the most important thing  possible.  I had this really cogent speech on why arts were at the core of learning.  (Laughs) And he said,    I know all that, now what are we going to do  about it?    I had not prepared that part at all  He really was for it and I  had this fifteen minute appointment. Two hours later, I walked out of  there chairman of an arts taskforce. I   d gotten his agreement that his  secretaries would do all the scut work   get the letters out. I   ll set up the  meetings but I don   t want to do the typing and that was before e-mails  13  and I don   t want to spend my time on the phone. We had a really good  committee and then I went over to the Arts and Humanities Council, I  was on the board, Wendy Thomas was the director. And I said,    Now  Wendy, I have taken this on and this is really an Arts and Humanities  Council job. And I want you to take it on with me, you have my total  support.     Now we have fifty-five elementary schools with music and art. It  changed, and it was just a series of the most amazing unexpected things.  That was probably in October. We got some really good people, we set  up a little steering committee and we had a big committee and they were  interested. I called on every single school board member and every  single one was for it.    But how can we do it? We don   t have any money  but we are for it.    And I went to the Tribune and the World and met with  the editorial boards and I heard about how they played saxophone in the  Sand Springs band. Everybody was for it but how do you get it done?  We went to a lot of Christmas parties that year. But the first one was  given by BOK  Bank of Oklahoma  at Southern Hills and Eugene  Swearingen came up to me and said,    Nancy, that   s the most wonderful  thing you are doing and I want to help.    I said,    Oh Gene, that   s  wonderful.    He had been president of the BOK, and president of TU.     Let me figure out how to put you in.    Then someone else came up, then  another. I took some napkins and started writing people   s names down  and by the end of the evening I had 200 of the most powerful people in  Tulsa. (Laughs) Then I went to all the arts boards and got more  signatures.  So we had the power of Tulsa behind us for the first time and we came  up with a plan. John had said,    I want to have a plan by January 1st.    So  we worked on it. Got a very slick thing put together, the schools  presented it and furnished artwork together. We had such incredible     this must have been the next year   we had such incredible cooperation.  Only a few south side schools had art. None of the north side schools.  Plus which, none of the north side principals wanted it because they  said,    We have to concentrate on reading and math. Everything extra we  have we put in on math and reading, particularly reading.    And I said,     But you are not getting it done.       Well if we just had more time or  another system.    I said,    All of the research proves that the arts help  children learn. They learn in different ways.     I went to Reuben Gant who was the president of the North Tulsa  Chamber of Commerce. Rueben got it quickly. I said,    Okay, now, what  are you going to do about those principals?    He said,    I don   t know.     And here we had a Black superintendent of schools. Well, he was a  funny man. We got along really well, really well. I wrote all of his art-  14  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  connected speeches. I did all his letters. I spoke to the principals for him.  The school board went along with it a hundred percent, and we got it  done. You can   t do that in a city like Chicago.  Have you been able to go into the classroom and see the efforts of these  students?  Yes, I have and I enjoy reading to classes every year. Ann Tomlins, who  is the new superintendent of art, brought this  shows Nykolaiszyn  student created artwork  over to me and she said,    This is what you  did      That   s great.  So there are a lot of examples. I like to work with a group. I work very,  very hard but I want to work with a group. I feel I am not a solo worker.  I get very buoyed by a group and get lots of ideas from a group. Maybe  it goes back to my little group of Five Funny Freaks. (Laughs) I have  always worked in a group, or in a family. And then I have the most  supportive husband in the world. The first thing was soon after I came to  Tulsa, I was local government chair of the League of Women Voters.  And I found out that the  city  health department was absolutely  horrible. The county had a health department that was absolutely  horrible. I did a lot of study on it. And of course, the obvious thing was  why not put them together? (Laughs) And that year for the League, I  worked up a series of charts showing where we were.  Our milk was not inspected properly. I could go into this in ghastly  detail, it was all very vivid to me  Meadowgold at the time used to  discount me saying that I was paid by my uncle who owned Hawk   s  Dairy. I did not have an uncle. But Meadowgold had undated milk. And  here was a city in the twentieth century without dates on the bottles. And  we had all kinds of examples like that. I made charts showing disease  rates, inoculations, vaccinations, etc. And I went around and did 97  speeches in Tulsa on the city health department saying it had to be put  together with the county health department so we could have a qualified  director and adequate service. And the chamber of commerce finally got  interested and that made a huge difference. Chamber of commerce got  interested in the arts in education after first saying,    No this is not our  area.    I mean, we had a hundred percent cooperation. I like working that  way.  Now the milk was in the 1940s, right?  In the 1947.  15  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Okay.  Well, yes. We were married in 1946. And this was all done by 1950.  And that was the first thing. It was a very empowering thing to do. I  mean I got it done. Our mayor at the time was named Lee Price. And  we   d go to so many dinners together before speeches   Rotary, Kiwanis,  church groups   and I knew that he didn   t like peas and he knew that I  didn   t like bread. He   d just pass his peas and I would pass my bread  back. I think you can get so much done when you have fun together and  enjoy a relationship. This is a very cooperative community. They like to  work together. And it   s a progressive community. It   s not a liberal  community but it   s a progressive community.  In the field of health, I also put together, much later, through the  Community Service Council   always, there   s some organization or  group that I rely on. But I am a hard worker. I like working. I   ve got  energy and I like using it and I like interacting with people. So I have  just done a lot of different things. Oh my, the other thing   we had  horrible maternal mortality statistics in Tulsa. We now have the best in  the state by far, although it is slipping. We put together a coalition called  the Perinatal Coalition. Raymond asked me what I wanted for my  birthday one year and I said,    I want no pregnant woman to have more  than a two week waiting period before she can see a doctor whether she  has any money or not.    (Laughs)  Did he deliver?  He did  And I really copied that technique from my friend Joan Flint,  who, when Bill asked her what she wanted for her birthday one year,  brought a speaker here that was absolutely marvelous. He was very well  known, but I disagreed with him. He spoke in a public meeting. And I  raised my hand and Bill said to me, that when he was driving him to the  airport, he says,    Who was that lady in the hat (Laughs) who asked me  that question? She is right, you know.    And so I got the idea of a  birthday present from Joan. It   s been a very, very enriching experience  to me, to be able to work on these things, to be able to see results, to pull  a variety of people together.  And you   ve done a lot in, in Tulsa really.  Well yes, I have been here a long time. (Laughs) I am 85 years old   Well, we are going to get back to a few of the things you did a little bit  later.  Okay.  16  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Because I made a list. (Laughs) But I want to get back to something you  were mentioning during your days at Vassar. What did you end up  majoring in?  Well, I ended up with my father losing a heck of a lot of money and not  being able to send me back my junior year.  Okay.  And yet, I wasn   t eligible for a scholarship. And so    I was still  majoring in music but taking very little of it and taking lots of econ and  psychology. What my father said is,    I don   t want you to come out of a  college without knowing that you are going to be able to do something  and I am not sure we will be able to get a master   s degree for you. We  think   your mother and I   that       I forgot to tell you something  important. When I transferred to Highland Park High School, my junior  year   I loved it. I loved being back with all my close friends. It was  much easier situation and I was, you know, doing wonderfully.  I was not studying at all and I was making straight As. I came home one  afternoon and I said,    Argh, it   s so boring, I can   t stand it     And my  mother said,    I know and you won   t have to because I have had all your  classes transferred to the morning and you are going to Northwestern  University in the afternoon.       I am?    (Laughs) I tell you, I can   t believe  how obedient I was but I knew that this was right. So, I   d gone to  Northwestern some times in the summer and taken music courses. And  so I began at Northwestern and I was taking music courses and then I  took an English course, and so that when my father said you have to  come home from Vassar and go to Northwestern, I found I had over a  year of courses at Northwestern already. And I wasn   t a junior, I was a  senior, and I was majoring in speech which was not at all interesting to  me.  Wow.  And I had taken a few extra courses at Vassar too but not    I couldn   t  take extra courses there. That was hard stuff. But Northwestern was easy  and I didn   t like it at all.  Did you live at home during that time?  I lived at home. That was part of it. I was not used to it and obeying and  being sweet, good, and darling. (Laughs) Christmas time, I said I just  hate Northwestern. And my brother-in-law who had gone to the  University of Chicago Law School said   we were all sitting around,  Christmas tree at one end of the room, stockings still hung up and my  17  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  brother-in-law said,    You know, Nancy, I always thought you would be  a wonderful lawyer. And the law school at Chicago is so sociologically  oriented and so psychologically oriented. You would really like that.     And my father said,    What a great idea     And my brother fell asleep on  the couch, and by the time he woke up, it was all set that I was to go out  and interview at the law school with my mommy and see if I could get  into the law school.  It was a cold snowy day, we took the train in   it was war time, no gas     and went to the law school. And I didn   t see how inappropriate it was for  a girl to be   first off, for a girl to go to law school. It never occurred to  me, this was not really done and certainly not to bring your mother with  you. And I remember the admissions officer saying,    Mrs. Goodman, I  want to hear from your daughter.    (Laughs) And I thought he thought I  was just a little girl. But anyway, I got into the law school on the basis of  my crazy record of Northwestern and Vassar.  I ended up with very good grades and on the dean   s honor roll at Vassar.  And so suddenly I was in a course that would be a four year law school  course and it would include law and the nature of man, moral and  political philosophy, all kinds of things that were my kind of thing. And  I didn   t know about this law stuff. I knew so little and I was starting in  the second   it was a quarter system   I was starting in the second  quarter, and there were four other girls in the whole law school.  Not a lot.  Not a lot. It was war time, and there were not a lot of men in there. The  law school was small, which was probably why I got in so easily. I was  just fascinated. But there were things I didn   t understand. Like, why  were all the judges either named C.J., Charles James or Charles John, or  just J. I never thought of Justice and Chief Justice. I mean this is how     why, why were they always in trial court? When were they going to get  to the real court? I mean, dumb  (Laughs) I was so ignorant. In my  contracts class, there was another woman in my class, Miss Green   she  didn   t last long. But our professor always used her as an example and he  said,    Miss Green versus the flag pole.    So I was looking for this case, I  didn   t know it was just an example.  The women in law school were, except for Boots Green who dropped  out, were pretty grim. They wore neck ties and vests and good solid  shoes. And they didn   t like me. They didn   t talk to me and there was one  other girl in the law school named Jewel Stratford, whose father  originally came from Tulsa   a black lawyer who left during the time of  the race riot. Jewel and I became really very, very close friends. She was  absolutely beautiful and smart and sweet and everything good. Well,  18  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  these three girls, if we walked into the ladies    room   there was a big  room there and you could sit and talk, but when we came in  conversation stopped. And we would wonder,    Why don   t they like us?     We spent hours talking about why we were being snubbed by them;  women   s unity had not come into play.  Uh-huh.  Why didn   t they like us? What was the matter? They were never nice to  us. They never said,    Sit down and talk,    or anything. Jewel said,    It   s  because I am black.       I am a Negro,    was the term. And I said,    Jewel,  why don   t they like me?    And she said,    Because you are my best  friend.    And so it went on and on. We talked about this and they were  never, never, never nice to us at all. In 1968, Jewell and I roomed  together at a conference in Washington, D.C. She was head of the  Illinois Commission on Civil Rights and I was the head of the Oklahoma  Commission on Civil Rights. So we were going to this convention  together and what fun, we could be together again  (Laughs) So, we  went back to our same old topic of conversation. I said,    There they  would sit in those man-tailored suits and those neck ties   Oh     Neither  of us, we were both so innocent, we had never thought    I don   t think  I   d ever heard of a lesbian. But they were all lesbian and felt very  threatened by us, or superior to us, or something.  It had a very interesting effect upon on me. I did not want to be that kind  of a lawyer. I did not want to stride into a law court and pretend to be a  man. Men were being drafted, and I began a tradition at law school that  everyone should give me   when they left for the Army they should give  me a shirt and I would have ruffles put on it and wear it. Now for the  first set time I always wore high heels and stockings. I walked three-quarters  of a mile to school in my high heels and stockings. And when a  professor once asked me   this was in my freshman year   he said,     Miss Goodman, why are you in law school?    I said,    I want to sway the  jury with my hips.    (Laughs)  Well, I think told you, I   d always been maybe averagely popular or a  little sub-averagely popular with boys. Sub-averagely, I would say.  Suddenly, I was the most popular thing in the world. I was so feminine  and I was so adorable and I was so stupid. I was dated up months ahead.  I was sent flowers. My roommate, Arlene, and I would make up these  things that I would say, like,    These books are so heavy. Would you  carry some?    (Laughs) And I lost all respect for these dumb guys. What  was the matter with them? Here I was this perfectly wonderful person  whom they never noticed until I acted like a fool. And then    I was  really disgusted. I had marriage proposals. It was awful.  19  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Well how did you meet your husband?  Well, he was in law school too, coming on one and a half years later  than I because he had been in the Army. We were good friends, no  romance. A mutual friend of ours invited us to a party. When she called  me, I said,    Isn   t there someone else I could go with?    She said,    What  makes you say that?    I said,    He is so nice but he is so uninteresting as a  man. He is just not at all interesting.    She said,    Do you think so? Well,  no one else does.    And she said,    But it is funny, he said he didn   t want  to take you either.    She said,    But I am just inviting my close friends  and you have to go with him.    We had to walk down to the beach. On  the way over, I started my silly talk. And he said,    You can cut that coy  stuff with me.    We danced together that night and I thought,    Oh, my  God     (Laughs) I had never felt that way before.  We had a big law school picnic and I was President of the Junior Bar  Association. Of course, all those boys went out and voted for me  because I was so dumb. We rented a big community cabin. It turned out  there was a huge snowstorm and we had to stay overnight. The boys had  brought dates and the girls were having hysterics because they couldn   t  go home. The place was used by the Boy Scouts beforehand and they  had left syrup all over all the dishes. Raymond and I washed all the  dishes, calmed the girls, got the garbage detail going, and we came home  from that and we both lived at International House on boys and girls  sides which was strictly observed, I think. We went in for some ice  cream and he said,    I did not want to take you to this. I knew I would  fall in love with you and I did not want to.    (Laughs) And that was it, we  just started talking and talking and talking. I had another boyfriend that  was fairly serious but Ray and I talked and talked and I was such a  goody-goody. We occasionally held hands. We come from very, very  different backgrounds. He comes from an Orthodox Jewish family and  mine was totally non-observant, with none of the traditional culture.  They didn   t think much of my family and my family didn   t think much  of them.  Was he from...  Tulsa. And my father certainly didn   t like the idea of my going to live in  Tulsa, which he called,    The Cultural Capital of the World.    (Laughs)  But nobody opposed it. It just wasn   t an enthusiastic process.  What year did you graduate from     Law school? January of 1946. We got married in March. He had been in  the Army and was discharged medically and came back to school. Went  back to OU and OU wasn   t as good as it had been. He was looking for  20  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  something else. He applied to Harvard, Yale, and Chicago, and was  accepted at all, but Chicago had the best summer program for him so he  went. I remember he walked into the library and I was working in the  library and I thought.    Well, here is another new slob.    (Laughs) It   s  been wonderful.  How did you get to Tulsa?  Well, he wanted to live here and I did not. So, well the proposal was a  pretty wonderful thing. My parents insisted that I visit his parents and  see what they were like, sure that would turn me off and it almost did. It  was over Halloween and one night we came home from some party and I  said,    I just cannot live in a segregated community. I find this so  offensive. I cannot live here.    We had been talking about marriage for  months but I said,    I can   t live here.    He said,    Well, marry me and  desegregate it.    So that was one of the first things I did. We had Black  friends from the beginning. We worked on getting several organizations  we were in to admit blacks for the first time   League of Women Voters.  Raymond belonged to a thing called American Veterans Committee  which admitted Blacks where as the other veterans organizations didn   t  and I went on the board of NAACP here and I was the only women and  the only white.  A nice funny small world thing   Dr. Norval Coots was a very  prominent Black physician here and his wife, Gladys. I met her at  something and we looked at each other and we looked at each other and  she said,    Did you go to Northwestern in the summer program in the  music school in 1939?    I said,    Yes.    She said,    Look at me, do you  remember me?    I said,    Oh, do I remember you.    I was fifteen and I had  a white dress on and I was asked to go to the black board and I had  started menstruating and didn   t know it. She came up behind me, took  me out and got me cleaned up. Here we were back in Tulsa on other  sides, on opposite sides of town. She and I did sit-ins at Utica Square,  and at the Mayo Hotel. (Laughs) She was gorgeous. Oh, Gladys was a  great beauty, very smart and very elegant.  Were you ever arrested?  No, but we sat at what is now the Wild Fork, for two hours without  being waited on, right in the window. But I had done this in Chicago too.  I had done it at the Blackstone Hotel and the Drake Hotel. This was part  of my growing up, that you did not discriminate, at all. I think my  parents followed it pretty well. They didn   t have Black friends but a  Black speaker would come to town and they would be entertaining him.  I had some skin problems and my mother took me to a Black physician  way on the south side    We lived on the north, twenty-five miles north  21  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  of Chicago. She took me to a Black physician on the south side of  Chicago. And I am sure it was just    it   s interesting as I think about my  mother and I have been thinking about her more and more, my father  seemed to be the dominant influence in my life. We were very much  alike. He was more dynamic, very brilliant, a very exciting man to be  with. So I identified with him and I thought my mother was the lovely  homemaker who ran a very good home and did all these lovely volunteer  jobs. But as I look back on it, who was getting me to go to  Northwestern? Who was sending me to New Trier?  She had a plan.  She had a plan.  It was kind of covert. (Laughs)  You know, I didn   t realize how    Well, Raymond always says,    You  always underestimated your mother.    (Laughs) I loved her dearly. She  was most loveable and very funny and she was very capable, full of  common sense. But his highest compliment to me is,    That   s like your  mother.     Wow. So you are a newly minted lawyer in Tulsa.  Yes.  Can you find a job?  Could not find a job. I was editor of the Law Review. I had very good  grades.    How fast do you type?       I don   t type at all.       Well, how did  you get through law school?    In those days, nobody typed. I said,    Well,  I had a secretary because I was editor of the Law Review.    Well, here  were some of the answers.    I just might put you on and we could have  dinner and talk about cases at night.       Why would you want to do that?     I mean, sometimes I am not quite bright. Maybe very often. (Laughs) I  got all these weird offers and I would tell Raymond and he   d say,    Don   t  you understand?    But no one had ever treated me that way.  Did you want to work in law?  Oh yes, I never thought of anything else. One day, I got turned down. I  got turned down so much. There were four women lawyers, here, all of  whom had gone to night law school and typed. When I was going to take  the bar, they took me out to lunch and told me I should type my bar  exam because they had worked so hard to make it possible to type your  bar exam. And I said,    Well, I don   t know how to type.       We will teach  22  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  you.       I have to learn about Oklahoma law, not about typing.    I also had  to learn not to be so offensive. (Laughs) I got turned down by  everything.  I walked out to TU  University of Tulsa  one day. I was furious. It was  109 on the First National clock and I walked out to TU.    What could I  teach? What could I teach? Either psychology or sociology.    And I  called the sociology department, walked in there and met this man, Dr.  Kovacs. You have to remember this was just immediate post war. No  men had been in universities for years and there were a huge number of  people coming back. He said,    I   ll give you a start.    He said,    You will  have to talk to John Rogers who is the head of personnel for the board.     So I went to talk to John Rogers. The law school is named after him, our  John Rogers Law School. I   d also applied for a place at the juvenile  court. And we talked a little bit and then he said,    Okay Nancy, you and  I are on the same wavelength. You interrupt me, I will interrupt you. We  know what we are saying, let   s just move this along.    And so we were  talking chh chh chh chh. Okay, then he said,    Now Nancy, you can  choose which ever one you want. I would advise you to take the TU  position and I will arrange for it immediately.    (Laughs) That was it.  And you spent how long at TU?  37 years.  Wow.  I went to full time, and I adored it. It was everything I wanted and when  we had children, I could be home by three o   clock. I thought,    Why did I  ever think I wanted to practice law?     What were some of the classes that you taught?  Well, of course, in the beginning I taught introductory sociology, social  problems, etc. I went down to the library and studied everything I could  about introductory sociology and social problems. Then I taught an  introduction to social work, which I had a lot of background on. My  father had been a Hull House boy. Have you ever heard of Hull House?  It was a settlement house in Chicago for poor kids. It had a huge  influence on him. Miss Jane Addams, who started it   he was on the  board of trustees later on, with Miss Addams, I read everything that she  wrote. I knew her well. The drama teacher there (my father had wanted  to be an actor and was in all the plays) used to come to our house almost  every Sunday, as I can recall. And we   d go out on trips together and  picnics. And Miss de Nancrede and occasionally Miss Addams who was  23  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  very famous.  When I went to the University of Chicago, they had a very distinguished  faculty in the School of Social Work, most of whom had studied at Hull  House or had been connected with it. Miss Abbott called me up and she  said,    Nancy Goodman, what are you doing in law school? You should  be in the school of social work, SSA, Social Services Administration.    I  said,    I am loving law school.    She said,    You will have to take a course  from me.    So I sat in a lot of courses in SSA from probably the most  outstanding teachers in the country, all of whom knew my father. My  life is full of serendipity. I had a friend whose father was without  question the most distinguished urban sociologist in the country. She  wanted to live on campus. No, she couldn   t live on campus because it  was too expensive but she was allowed to invite someone to live with  her at home. She invited me. Mr. Wirth taught urban sociology on  Thursday nights at home and I sat in on it. I was fascinated by urban  sociology. This was a master   s degree seminar. I decided to write the  paper for the class because I was so charged. (Laughs) I wrote the paper  and he asked me,    Nancy, would it embarrass you if I read your paper?     And I said,    To the whole class?    And he said,    Yes.    I said,    I think it  would. Maybe I won   t come.    He said,    No, I want you there.    By that  time, I was no longer living there. Nancy had gone away   she was a  Nancy too. Anyway, he read my paper and said,    This is the best paper I  got.    So of course I taught Urban Sociology and Poverty, and related  new courses on poverty and women and many others.  So the whole thing meant sociology. My whole background   my  father   s connection with Hull House, my mother setting up free  breakfast at the elementary school for children. Everything in my  background led to it. And one day I told my great lie. I was teaching a  class in social work and I had Miss Addams    book and the frontispiece  has a little girl   I have the picture downstairs   with long curls and high  lace shoes. I said,    This is me with Miss Addams.    Why did I say that? I  have lied to my class, I have lied. I didn   t say that. I went home thinking,     This is terrible. How could I have done this?    That summer, we had a  Goodman family reunion in California and one of my cousins said to  me,    You know, Nancy, I have that original picture of you and Miss  Addams.    I was three years old. And I hadn   t lied  But you can see, it  still bothers me.  Wow. How about that? Channeling it.  You know I thought for six months I told a real puffing lie (Laughs) and  I agonized over it.  Do you have any other moments from the classroom that really stick out  24  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  for you?  Oh I have lots. I adored teaching. I really did. I   d be so pumped up after  teaching. I did a lot of acting in teaching. I am not my father   s daughter  for nothing. I have students that I remember so well and whom I still  see. Jim Inhofe, our esteemed Senator   s sister Marilyn still is one of my  favorite students. She was brilliant and beautiful and charming, and we  disagree on everything (Laughs) but we are good friends. I had so many  wonderful students and I really connected with them. Jim was in a class  of mine, too.  I   ll tell you a funny one. I was teaching a course in group work in the  social work side of it and I had mostly athletes. The school was full and  there was a little room over the book store and I was assigned to that  room. I walked in   I was twenty-three when I started teaching, I was  probably twenty-five then   and I looked around, there was no desk.  There was just kind of a collection of chairs and tables. I didn   t know  where I was going to stand and one of the students said,    Well, just sit  down over there, I am going to lecture from here.    So I sat down and  then the time for class came,    Class,    I said,    I will start lecturing.     Well, the poor guy was so embarrassed. But he turned out to be one of  the great ones. Both a fine student and a fine football player.  I   ve mothered a lot of the wonderful social workers in Tulsa.  That  football player  ended up at the Juvenile Court  as a social worker . I  cannot think of anything more satisfying than teaching and feeling that  you have influenced people to go into a field that you think is important.  So I adored teaching. I used to say that I was the highest paid grader  around because I taught for free. In my mind, I assigned my whole  salary to grading papers. (Laughs)  Well, it   s amazing that while you were teaching you were, like we spoke  about earlier, you were doing all these great things in the Tulsa  community, too.  Yes, but you have to realize there wasn   t the pressure there is now to do  research and write. I liked doing research but I liked doing it on  problems here. I did not write. I had four book contracts and I never  came through on any of them. I am a talker and I still have a big thick  manila folder in my file that I call it    Will I or Won   t I.    It   s all of the  things I want to write. And so as a writer, I am a total failure.  There is still time.  I like writing but it is so alone.  25  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  I   d like to go back and talk about some of the things you have done in  the Tulsa community.  Okay.  I read somewhere about you and the credit card company. Tell me about  that.  Okay. Well, this is the women   s rights in me. I don   t think my mother  was so women   s rights-y but she was highly respected by my father and  was treated with great respect by everybody. The first was the Bank  Americard, the first credit card, and I couldn   t get a credit card   they  did not give them to women. I was furious. So, was this in a newspaper?  I found it in a newspaper article, yes.  Huh. Well, I kept calling them   Bank America   and saying    Why can   t  I get a credit card?       Your husband has a credit card.    I said,    Why  can   t I get one? I want a credit card.       No,    I said,    I am going to  England and I am going to be lecturing in England and I   ve got to have  my own credit.       No, no.    Then they called Raymond and said,    Your  wife is making such fuss about a credit card that if you say that it   s okay,  we   ll give her one.    He said,    Well, I won   t. I think you should look at  her income; look at her salary and you decide whether you would give a  person with that salary and that credit history a credit card.    Well, they  didn   t. I was in England then and the Barclays Bank was their  correspondent. They gave me the credit card.  Around what time was this?  This must have been 1975, I would say.  And did you do a lot of international lecturing?  I did a fair amount. I was very lucky. My life is full of luck. It   s a  serendipitous life. There was a woman who was lecturing here for  British American Associates and I met her and we just clicked and  became good friends and then   I   d done something that got everybody  angry at me about Blacks. I forget what it was. But they talked to her  about this and what I did and she liked it. (Laughs) I think I   d refused to  go to Southern Hills. I am not quite sure what it was. And she liked it  and called me up and said,    I want to see you. I have free time  tomorrow. Could you have lunch?    I changed some things and we had  lunch. We talked and talked and we just really liked each other. And  later she recommended that I be the next lecturer because in alternate  years the lecturer went from the United States to England. So I did that.  26  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  And I did it twice. She died two years ago but we had been very, very  close friends. She was a judge. It was really interesting.  What a great opportunity.  Yes, it was wonderful. So I did three months in England for two years.  While I was in England, the first time, an Indian man, a student at the  University of Manchester, a graduate student there, came up to me after  my lecture and says,    What can I do to get you to come lecture in  India?    I said,    Just set it up for me. I   d love it.    I gave him my name.  He gave me his. A few days or a week later, I was lecturing at the  University of Birmingham, another Indian came up and said exactly the  same thing. So I gave him the other one   s contact. They didn   t know  each other but they put together a consortium of eighteen different  universities which sponsored me on a lecture trip in India. And let   s see  where else I   ve been? Oh, I did a lecture trip in Egypt, and then, oddly  enough, got one in Israel because of that. (Laughs) One led to another.  Then I did it in Peru. Those are the major ones, many, many all over the  USA.  What would you lecture about?  Well, in England, it was to make Brits and Americans more aware of  each other   s cultures. The first time, oh I did America   s middle class,  middle west cities was one of them. It was a time when cities were being  burned and there were all these riots. I wanted them to know that  Omaha, and Tulsa, and Wichita, were peaceful cities busy solving  problems, so that was one. The Indians in American life. Women,  always women. I did   both times   I invented a lecture that I did all  over the world then. I got interested in communications and I would seat  two people in front of an audience back-to-back. They each had a table  in front of them and a set of kindergarten blocks, exactly the same  blocks. I would say,    You   re the leader, you tell what kind of a structure  you are going to build and she will follow you.    I would do it three  ways. The first time you just went through it and then you looked at each  other   s and they were of course totally different. The second time, if you  didn   t understand what the leader was saying you could go like this:  THWACK THWACK. And the leader would usually respond,    I said,     To put the large rectangle on its side.       He would get very, you know,     why am I being challenged?    And it still didn   t come out the same   it  came out a little better but not proper. And the third time they could say,     I don   t understand what you mean by this.    So it was early in the times  when we were learning about communication. I don   t know how I came  up with it. I refined it over a series of occasions but it was incredibly  popular, really all over the world.  27  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Most interesting, TU, at that time, had a huge number of Middle Eastern  students, mostly Arab students, in their petroleum engineering classes  and I was teaching a class on the impact of technology on society that  they had to take whether they wanted to or not. So I would start out with  this, and they would say,    That does not happen in Arabic. Arabic is  perfectly clear.    I said,    Okay, do it.    Nothing is perfectly clear. I did it  at Junior Leagues all over the country. I did it I don   t know how many  times. And then I thought, I should write this up. I can   t really stand the  thought of it anymore. One thing about me is I am not disciplined  enough. I want to get it done and I am very impatient.  Now you started a few non-profit groups here in Tulsa. Tell me about  the Tulsa Center for the Physically Limited.  Oh yes. I was, at that time, President of the Council of Jewish Women,  which like the Junior League had the mission of finding unmet needs in  the community, pulling together a community group, and fulfilling those  needs. By the time I became president, the group was fairly much falling  apart or they wouldn   t have asked me because I don   t fit the mold. I  decided we needed a really good project. So I spread it around the board  members that we had to find a project that Tulsa really needed and that  was maybe unique. And Dorothy Whitebook was in San Francisco and  saw a center for physically handicapped, as it was put, and came back  with the idea. I investigated it a lot more. It wasn   t exactly what I  thought was the best thing because it wasn   t pushing people with  disabilities out into the community which I thought was important. But  we brought the founder here, she stayed with us and gave a speech to a  big group again group, group, group    Cerebral Palsy, every group that  I could think of.  Everybody thought this just we needed, these people are hidden away.  And so the Council of Jewish Women voted to subsidize it until it could  be taken over by the community. I chaired the steering committee to  investigate feasibility. It seemed to be that everybody thought that this  was a really big need to get people out of their houses because they were  just hidden away. It turns out, they really were. I would go up to a   I  remember names. I would go up to a house and say,    Do you have a son  here named George?       No.       Well, it says you have a son named  George, who   s a little bit handicapped, maybe.       Well, yes.       Would  you be interested in having him come to a center where he could be with  other people like him and spend a day and give you a little relief?       Oh,  yes.    I mean we pulled them out of attics.  It was amazing, and Hillcrest Hospital   the Council of Jewish Women  had done a project for Hillcrest where they did diversion therapy for  mentally ill people. They had done that for years. They had a lot of extra  28  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  space. We could have it. So we started in there. The Council of Jewish  Women paid for the salary of a full-time occupational therapist but it  was a big mistake. We needed someone who was not interested in  making you work but who emphasized having fun. We had all these  volunteers and it just boomed after we changed to a more appropriate  director.  Another group that you were involved with was the Tulsa Global  Alliance.  Oh yes, that again wasn   t my idea. Denny Cook came here, we met her  at a party at Josie and Tom Winters    and she was talking about what she  had done in Washington which was to work for the Global Alliance  there and how they brought people in. Raymond and I, through a friend  of mine, Rose Carol, one of my five, whose husband was teaching at  Kansas State University, when we were living in a little tiny one  bedroom apartment. She said that we should be taking in foreign visitors  and giving them a tour of the city and letting them know what life was  like in Tulsa and that they were doing that in Manhattan, Kansas. And  wouldn   t we do it? And so yes, we did it. Then when we moved into our  house, why we had them by the score. So Denny said,    Well, you are  just the person I need, we   ve got to get this started in Tulsa.    Well, she  didn   t know anybody in Tulsa but she knew all about what it should be  like. So the two of us made a perfect team and it just went flying off.  Everybody was so helpful. I remember Jenk Jones was the editor of our  newspaper and he was strong for it. Everybody was really good, and the  Chamber was for it. It was hard work. I like hard work.  I can see that. Well, you   ve done so many things. Can you go into detail  about a key moment that you consider one of your biggest highlights?  There is no question. For me, the biggest highlight of my life was  marrying Raymond Feldman. I know that sounds mushy but, he has just  been the most fulfilling and ideal man for me. He is just right for me.  Pushes me along but doesn   t push. Opens things up, supports, and we  have such fun together and I love him.  Well going back to 1995, when you were notified that you were going to  be inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame.  I couldn   t believe it. I was just thrilled. I really was thrilled. I have been  amazed at the honors given to me because I have not thought of myself  as    Well, my original five did not think of me as a great leader,  (Laughs) so I have never thought of myself as that and it turns out that in  our lives, we each turned out to be. And these awards, because people  have hated me because they think I am doing the wrong thing,  29  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  particularly about Blacks, or birth control, or other things that they think  are terrible. So the award kind of says to me,    They do approve of me. It  is okay.     Do you remember who presented you at the ceremony?  I forget. I can remember so much about it. Our whole family came.  Did you have a lot of family and friends there? A lot of supporters?  Yes. A surprising    I don   t always expect that, you know? It was very  reaffirming because I think anybody who does things that are different,  you share the bumps, and an award like this helps the bumps a lot. I  remember, maybe one of the first awards I got, I don   t know, I think it  was. I just got the invitation to the next meeting, but in 1973 Women in  Communication gave me an award. I thought,    Why me?    I was just so  startled. It   s hard to think of yourself as one of these wonderful people  who gets awards. You don   t go through life thinking this way.  Well, how do you feel that now people look at you as a role model?  I think I am very lucky and I want to be a good role model. I want to tell  them that you can do things that are hard and nasty and you don   t always  get kudos all along the way. There are people that dislike me. How can  they? (Laughs) Gardening has been   two things have been a very big  influence in our lives.  Gardening?  Gardening, we had never anticipated. And travel.  Why is that?  I think gardening is very nurturing to the soul. We need beauty. We like  to think of ourselves as being fairly non-material but we like to live in a  beautiful environment and we like to work in the soil and like to work  together. And then travel has been the other thing, which we could have  never have anticipated because we grew up in Depression and war. Who  would have ever have thought of travel? One time, one Sunday morning,  there was a magazine called Psychology Today. They had printed a  values chart   thirty six values. So we separately wrote down and rated  our thirty six values. To our enormous surprise, we both came out with  our first one being adventure. Our first three were exactly the same and  our bottom three, which were obedience, cleanliness    I forget what the  third was but it was the same    (Laughs)  30  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Have you lost track of how many countries you   ve visited?  Oh, yes. We never kept track  (Laughs) Our children gave us that globe  for our fiftieth wedding anniversary and it has a bunch of red stones     rubies we call them   and we glue them on but I am way behind. I forget  why we had to count them up one time. We   re over a hundred. But we  don   t count when we have just been in the airport, and counting isn   t  what it   s about for us. We like to go deep in our travel and we do a  tremendous amount of adventure travel. We have done six twenty-eight  day treks in Nepal.  Wow.  Like in India this year, we were studying tribals. We like a kind of in-depth  travel that most people don   t care for and we are willing to dig.  Well we have just come back from five weeks in Chile without a single  plan beforehand, but we have been to Chile enough and we just had a  wonderful time just going to parks and walking and finding hotels and  nothing planned. And I said,    You know, we are aging. We didn   t stay  in a single tent, a tree house, a cave, or a no-star.    (Laughs)  Do you speak many languages?  No, I speak passable French, somewhat passable German. I had a  German nanny growing up so I speak nursery German. Not adult  German. Raymond speaks Yiddish, which    (Laughs) We both speak  horrible Spanish. And we talk with our hands.  What has been your most absolute favorite place you have ever been?  Well, of course, home. We love Tulsa. But Nepal has meant a great deal  to us. We   ve only had one tragedy in our lives. We have been  extraordinarily fortunate. Our daughter died when she was thirty-seven  and we had a really very hard time. People kept coming over which we  appreciated and needed but we kept thinking, we   ve got to get away,  we   ve got to get away and handle this our own way and we found that  there was a trip to Annapurna with a company we have traveled with a  lot. We signed up in October and left. It made us feel how little we and  our troubles are and how we can connect to the world and put things in  proportion for us. We just said to everybody on the trip,    We are trying  to get over this. We are not going to be very sociable, we are not going  to sit around campfires.    We just had to work it through. And I think we  really have.  If you can give any piece of advice to Oklahomans, what would you tell  them?  31  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  We   ve got such potential here. It makes me sick. We could be the most  wonderful state. I will tell you what I told the Centennial Committee. I  wish we could be first in everything we   re last in, like education, and  last in everything we are first in like women   s imprisonment, out of  wedlock children, abortions, and child abuse. We can. It can be done  here. I don   t think people realize the potential of Oklahoma and how  people are really good and want to do the right thing but can be mislead  so easily. And then, our legislature enacts things like the 1407, is that it?  About the immigrants. Which is just kicking ourselves in the foot.  It   s interesting again in relationship to my mother, the three things that  she was most active in were the League of Women Voters, the Highland  Park Women   s Club, which I am not active in, and Planned Parenthood.  I think we   ve really got to help people understand about sex. We are  messing up people   s lives terribly with uninformed views of sex. I think  of these young girls getting pregnant and having a baby and not being  able to care for them properly, it   s tragic. I think this is a small enough  state that we can do something. It   s different when you got a billion  people like India and you see people lying on the streets. We don   t have  to have that in Oklahoma. We can work with people, and young men and  women must learn the facts about sex before the hormones take over.  What would your advice be to women who plan on following in your  footsteps?  Oh, enjoy it. Do it  Do it  Do it  Do it  But do only good. Behave and  protect yourself. Find the absolute perfect husband and if you don   t have  an absolute perfect husband, do it yourself. But the rewards in terms of  how you feel about life are so great. To get something done besides  cleaning your house, which is going to get dirty the next day    I am not  a wonderful cook and I am not a wonderful housekeeper. Luckily, we   ve  had wonderful children, so, I may be an alright mother. But I just don   t  think that a lot of the things people put a lot of time and energy into are  the things that count. I think, get some priorities and then take advantage  of every opportunity you   ve got.  Would you like to mention anybody or say anything about the people  who have helped play an important role in your life? I know we spoke  about your parents.  Parents, my husband. I think people have given me a chance. I think the  League of Women Voters nurtured me here so that I learned. I think I  have been on some very, very good boards. Being on the national Girl  Scout board was an exciting learning experience for me. Girls Scouts  has been   I think it made me able to make choices and to see choices  clearly. The new motto for Girl Scouts is    Where Girls Grow Strong     32  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  and I think I did. It   s hard to think of myself as a strong woman. You  know, we all are weak inside. We all have very vulnerable spots. I think  this has been a warm and gracious town to us. I   ve had my mentors like  Lucille Mulhall and Betty Bradstreet, and maybe I   ve modeled myself  after them. I think mentoring wasn   t in my vision but those are both  women who nurtured me through things. Got me into things, probably  kicked me in the butt. (Laughs)  Well, you mentioned your feelings towards Tulsa. What does Oklahoma  mean to you?  I don   t mean to be mushy about this, but I think Oklahoma means  opportunity. I really do think so, and I know that   s    I know sometimes  I get furious at it, particularly at the legislature. But the Community  Service Council has, through our work here, the Community Service  Council under Phil Dessauer   s leadership has put Tulsa in the front and  put Oklahoma in the front in early childhood education. Who would  have ever thought we would lead in early childhood education? And it  has to start with thinking and zeroing in on something that you think you  can do, although, everybody tells that you can   t or shouldn   t.  Well, when history is written about you, what would you like for it to  say?  Wow. Well I know what I say, I say I have to change the world. So  maybe history should say,    She tried to change the world so she failed.     (Laughs)  I think you made an impact.  I think everybody can. I really, really think that. I have learned so much  about how to work with people. I really enjoy it. Just before this  interview, I went to a ballet board meeting. We have one of the top  ballets in the world. Who would have ever thought that except  Moscelyne Larkin and Roman Jasinski, her husband, whom I met when  they first came here    they had both been with the Ballet Russe. I said,     Oh, my best friend growing up until second grade, Barbara Steele  was          Barbara  She was my roommate in the Ballet Russe.    So I  think of the day that Mosceylyne and Rosalie Talbott called me up and  said,    We want to start a ballet. Will you write the by-laws?       Sure.     (Laughs) Who knows what   s going to happen from just a little work?  Well, what   s next on the agenda for you? What do you have coming up  here on the horizon?  I want to move this arts in the schools along. I am on the board of A+  33  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Schools which is a national but statewide organization, I am on the state  board. I think we can get the schools much more involved in arts there is  no question that children perform better. I went to New York about eight  years ago, I am not sure when, and got the National Music Teacher   s  Award for grassroots work for what I had done here. They took me to  some schools with arts integrated into the curriculum in New York, in  the Bronx, the worst schools. It was summer and they took me to a class  of first graders, all of whom had failed and they were learning  arithmetic. First, they all made notes. They could choose a whole note, a  half note, a quarter note, an eighth note, a sixteenth note. They had made  the note the size they were and then they would say,    How many quarter  notes are there in a whole note?    And they would run across the room.  The first four that got there won and they learned how four quarter notes  made a whole note. They were doing with it eighths and sixteenths and  triplets. They were hearing the music, feeling the beat, but they were  crack at math. In first grade, they knew how to add, subtract, and do  fractions   one fourth a note, one eighth a note and they had all failed  first grade arithmetic. I think we must discover ways of teaching that  engage. Do you remember hours of teaching when you were bored? I  was.  Well, it   s great that they   re able to integrate music and math and if we  cut out arts, we lose that aspect.  Yes, I really think that finding the ways of teaching children really well  is perhaps the most important thing we can do. Now in India, they are  teaching the tribals so badly with rote learning and it means nothing.  They   re all over the floor doing nothing and not listening. They learn a  little, but it doesn   t have any relevance for them. I should have  mentioned that my public school was so big on nature, and that has had a  big carry over for me, bird feeders everywhere.  That   s great. Well, is there anything that I haven   t asked you today that  you liked to mention?  Yes, what do you regret about yourself, Nancy? (Laughs)  Well, tell us, Nancy.  Well, every New Year   s I vow to be less judgmental and more patient  but I   ve never achieved either. I don   t have as much self-discipline as I  would like and I think is necessary. I am very impatient and sometimes  impatient with people and I wish I weren   t. I really want to be polite and  nice and respectful to everyone. I think I deeply respect other people.  But when I get into a hurry I don   t always show that respect I feel.  (Laughs) You know, I don   t think I am a very special person at all. I  34  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  mean I am not saying this to be charming or because you are supposed  to be self-deprecatory, but I don   t really think I am a special person.  You think everybody can make a difference?  Yes, I do.  What are some little ways that ordinary people can make differences  everyday?  Well, I think a lot of women make differences in their home by just  creating an atmosphere that   s stimulating and respectful of others,  respectful of other ideas. But I think you can go beyond that and I think  you should go beyond that. Life is so much easier now than it was for  our forefathers and foremothers, that we can do more than just keep a  house clean. I find I   m very impatient with women who knit coat  hangers (Laughs) because I think they could do something more. Maybe  their ambitions have been squelched when they were young. And I think  we   ve got to have the courage of our convictions, even though it  sometimes slaps you in the face. One of the things that has been on my  mind but I did help start was a group that is flourishing today. It   s the  First Wednesday Reading Club. There were no ways of Black and white  women to get together and so a group of us just started a reading club  and we had to meet in homes because we couldn   t meet anywhere else  and it   s now a great group. Oprah has celebrated us because it   s one of  the first of these things.  How many members?  Now? Well, I don   t know, about thirty. But it was small in the  beginning.  Was it tough trying to help break those race barriers back then?  Yes. Yes. And you were criticized for it. The Blacks were too. It was  equally hard for them. Luckily, we had a good group of Black women,  Gladys Coots and then Gladys died and Norvel married another woman,  Theresa, who was terrific. He married great women. They had a little  boy exactly the age of our youngest. John is now fifty    Let   s see, he  was born in 1958 so he   s fifty. I remember one of his birthday parties  with Van Coots there and someone said,    Who   s the child who has a  chauffeur bringing him?    It was Dr. Coots. Having little Black boys to  your birthday party just was not done. Actually, we started it because  our oldest son Richard said something. We were driving. We lived on  Forty-sixth and Lewis then. We were driving out and a bus stop had a  bunch of black women waiting at the bus stop. And he said,    Look at all  35  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  the maids waiting at the bus stop.    I said,    How do you know they   re  maids? Maybe, they   re professors.    Why, I was just furious at him. I  thought,    We better get some Black friends for him, better get him  introduced to some other people.    It was hard in Tulsa. It was just plain  hard. There were no ways to go. So we started a play group. But you  know, you   ve got to erase those images. Listening to  Barack  Obama   s  speech yesterday, when he talked about his minister and his white  grandmother, I thought there it is. What are we passing down to  children?  Well, we have a long way to go but we   ve come a long way, too.  We have come a long way and I want people to know that. Sometimes,  they get discouraged. But we have. I mean this was a really segregated  community. You know where Yahola Park is now?  I do not.  Out at Mohawk Park. Well, the first year we were married, they were  going to build the new reservoir and they were taking away Colonel  Young Park, which was the Black park. So, guess who thinks she has to  stop this? (Laughs) Nancy Feldman. So I met with the Park Board and  the Park Supervisor, Mr. Ziegler. And a group of us   all Black men  except for me. Mr. Ziegler said he   d show us possible land for a park but  he wasn   t going with us. We went through this horrible place with burrs  and thorns and mud and we said yes we will take this as a park. At the  end of it, I said,    That   s the last bit of segregated something I will ever  work for.    But otherwise there would have been no park for them and no  chance, and it   s nearer their community than ours. But I made very good  friends among the black community there. We were really close friends.  There was a lawyer named Primus Wade and Primus and I decided to go  to the Mayo  hotel  on the sixteenth floor of the Mayo to a Bar  Association meeting. Well the Bar Association didn   t recognize women  and they were certainly weren   t going have a Black go into the Mayo.  So, we went down and had lunch on the river by ourselves.  Did you make an attempt to go in?  Oh yes, and it was a wonderful moment because Primus couldn   t get  into the elevator. So, he went to get a waiter and Primus put a white  napkin around his head and I had a big pin. And he put that on. We went  up, the maharajah and I. (Laughter) I like juggling a lot of balls.  You are a big multi-tasker.  Yes, oh yes. I think women grow up multi-tasking.  36  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  Nykolaiszyn  Feldman  I agree. I think men sometimes have trouble.  When they started talk about multi-tasking, I said,    I have always done  that      Well, we   re actually towards the tail end of the interview.  Okay.  Is there anything else you would like to add that we haven   t spoken  about today?  No, I feel incredibly grateful and I don   t want this to sound sobby. I do  feel very, very, very grateful to my family first of all, to my husband, to  our friends, and to the City of Tulsa and the state of Oklahoma. I really  do. I think I could not have thrived so well anywhere else.  But we do appreciate your time today. Thank you very much for  participating.  You are very welcome.  -------  -------
