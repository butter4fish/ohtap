 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Monday, December 13, 2010 and I am in Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma interviewing Suzanne Edmondson. This interview is  being conducted as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall  of Fame Oral History Project. Suzanne was inducted in the Oklahoma  Women   s Hall of Fame in 2009. Thank you for joining us today.  I am delighted to be here and appreciate the project very much.  Let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Can you tell me  where you grew up and give me a little background into your early life?  I grew up in Northern Illinois, due west of Chicago, an area called the  Quad Cities. It   s on the Mississippi River. I was born in Moline, Illinois  and lived for many years in that area. I attended high school in Rock  Island, Illinois and pretty much left the area because family moved  away. I have not been back. I recently discovered some high school  contacts. I haven   t been back to Illinois since 1974, so I   ve been gone  quite a long time.  When you were growing up, tell me about the schools you attended as a  young girl.  My mother was a Roman Catholic. Her only sister a nun, her only  brother a priest, though my father was an agnostic. We attended  parochial schools. When I was very young we had a home in town and a  little cabin, a cottage on the lake, on the Mississippi River, rather. One  year, we did not go back to town at the end of the summer. So going to  the good schools in town involved quite a commute and was with  questionable weather in the winters in Northern Illinois, it was quite an  effort on her behalf to have us hitting the road very, very, very early to  get to schools in town, to Rock Island. So Catholic all the way.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Were they large schools or small?  I am kind of the last of the pre-baby boomers, born in 1945. The classes  behind me were increasingly large as the veterans came home and  established their families. So, relatively speaking, my class, my schools  were very small, but the classes behind me were exponentially  increasing.  What sort of activities were you involved with growing up?  With the long commute, that kind of precluded a good bit of the after-school  activities. There were some things that I did in grade school when  we lived actually in the little town in East Moline where I went to  school. It was Girl Scouts and all the kind of regular things. Until we  drove at age sixteen, our attendance at football games and things like  that was somewhat problematic because it was about a forty-five minute  commute. One did not just jump in the car and run to town for that. Well  at least Mother and Dad weren   t willing to drive us that far after we   d  already traveled a good bit that day. So when we dated and things, we  became more active in what was going on in town.  That is a long commute.  Yes, it really was when you consider that at sixteen we were driving in  very hazardous conditions often through the winter. Of course, unlike  Oklahoma, Illinois is prepared and expects bad weather. So there was a  lot of road equipment, plowing and whatnot, but we were right on the  Mississippi and Iowa was in my front yard beyond the Mississippi. Big  open area with some very cold winds coming across the frozen river. I   m  very happy to live in the mid-south even though today is the coldest day  of the year. (Laughter)  As you were going through school, did you gravitate towards any  subjects that really piqued your interest?  I have always been attracted to literature and am quite a reader to this  day. I now facilitate a writing class down at Oklahoma County Jail for  the incarcerated women there. So, I still have my hand in on writing and  it   s a great pleasure. We three who facilitate think that we learn more  than our women do, but that   s how those things go.  We   ll get to that a little bit more in a second. As you were growing up  and you were going through grade school and high school, did you have  any ideas about what you wanted to be when you got older?  It was kind of a traditional time. When I graduated high school, John  6  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Kennedy was president and women in the main at that time were nurses  or teachers, stay-at-home moms and that sort of thing. I fully expected to  go to college and did, but really not with the notion to do anything  astonishing with it. I am very surprised the course that my life has taken  and that I   m here because of prison work. I couldn   t have imagined that  in my wildest dreams.  So you went on to college. Where did you go to college?  I went to Marycrest College, a women   s college in Davenport, Iowa and  transferred on down the line to the University of San Diego College for  Women. I have been pretty much, more or less, a senior in college since  about 1967.  That   s a big jump to California.  (Laughs) Yes, it was. I had an uncle there, my grandmother, and it was a  lovely opportunity for us, that was very interesting. San Diego is a Navy  city, of course. Those were Vietnam years when I was there. My  husband was a lieutenant in the Navy that I met in San Diego.  While you were in college?  Yes.  And how did you meet your husband?  I lived in Mission Beach in a little bitty apartment, but the ocean was  right there. I think this is from my old Mississippi River days; I need  water right out front. Jim, my husband, and two other officers from his  ship lived in an apartment the same size. (Laughs) I alone, and the three  of them, but somebody, one of those three, was always on duty and had  to stay on the ship. There was always an officer on duty, so it was never  all three of them at the same time, but he was my neighbor. I was the girl  next door.  And the rest was history.  (Laughs) Yes. We   re about to celebrate our forty-first anniversary, so  that   s some time ago.  So what happened after college years?  Well, traditional things. Raising children and I always was involved in  community work   I was a Girl Scout leader and on the board of the  YWCA and this and that, PTA, all those sorts of things. I always felt that  7  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  we needed to give to our community and I was off and on, for six years,  President of Friends of the Library in Muskogee. I believe that has a  good bit to do with why I named my foundation Friends of Eddie  Warrior. I think it was just an evolutionary step.  I know I keep pulling you back, but I am going to keep pulling you back  a little bit more. How did you get to Oklahoma?  I met Jim Edmondson, a lieutenant in the Navy, in San Diego in 1969.  He was coming out of the Navy at that time. He   d served on a ship in the  South China Sea. It was a helicopter carrier that had a squadron or fleet,  whatever, a bunch of Marines. The Marines were taken ashore for  operations in the country in Vietnam. The Tripoli, Jim   s ship, the  helicopter carrier then became a hospital ship and at times a morgue as  these people flew back. Jim was an officer of the deck. He was one of  three junior officers that drove the ship.  Anyway, we met. He had not yet gone to law school. We came to  Oklahoma to marry in Muskogee and moved to Washington, D.C.,  where he started Georgetown Law. That would   ve been 1970, the fall of     70 when he did that. So we lived there. It was great fun; my father-in-law  was in Congress at that time. We had kind of a schizophrenic life of  poor G.I. Bill law student family on the one hand with the Beanie  Weenies and on one hand very fancy fundraisers that we would go to  and people like Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey would be at the  next table. My wardrobe was jeans and very beautiful ball gowns. It was  odd and great fun; we enjoyed Washington very much. Our son was  born there and we still have ties to Washington. We have a niece that  lives there, and her husband, so we all consider Washington part of our  ongoing lives.  And then, eventually you made it back to Oklahoma?  Yes. My father-in-law, Ed Edmondson, ran for the U.S. Senate and Jim  and I came back, I think this would   ve been about    73,   74, along in  there, to campaign for him. It was an unsuccessful race. Jim became law  partners for a very brief time with his cousin, James Howard  Edmondson and we thought we would stay in Oklahoma City, but  ultimately it was more feasible for us to move to Muskogee, which we  lived there from    75 until 2004. So the bulk of our child raising years  were spent in Muskogee. I was involved, as I say, in typical do-gooder  sorts of things, making the community a better place, a good place.  Muskogee is a great city.  We enjoyed our time there very much. We, of course, sold our home  8  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  there when Jim came to the Supreme Court, but we still have a cabin  over in Cherokee County, the next county over, where we will travel on  Christmas day with our adult children. So we will have kind of an old  fashioned few days in the country coming up very soon.  Well you mentioned you were involved in various activities in Muskogee,  including serving on the Friends of the Library. I guess it   s that pattern  of literature, literacy still there, growing and building.  I view my life, very much, as kind of an evolution rather than distinct  chapters. I see one thing flowing into another, just very consistently. The  difference from my early campaign works, and of course I   m a mother at  the same time and raising children, my emphasis was improving my  community. When I began my prison work, I began to change lives and  there   s a substantial difference and the responsibilities are substantially  different. I take my work now very, very seriously when I kind of played  around with the other stuff and did lots of good things, I won   t diminish  that. I know so many women who work and take time to serve on boards  and do fundraisers and whatnot, it   s a big chore and I applaud them. I  feel fortunate that I am able to focus on my volunteer work and I take it  very seriously.  Could you tell me how working in the correctional institutions came  about?  In 1996, in October, I saw a deal in the Muskogee Public Library  offering a certification course, an instructional course in Laubach  Literacy changing. By this time, Jim has been a District Court Judge, he  was the presiding judge for about thirteen years, something like that, so  the criminal justice system is something I am intimately aware of and I  had always taken stacks of magazines and things to the Oklahoma  County Jail, carefully marking out my name and address. The plight of  the incarcerated, death penalty issues, things like that have been lifelong  concerns, though I have never been actively involved in any of those  issues up until that point. I purposefully took the Laubach course  because it was my intention to get a foot in the door at Eddie Warrior  Correctional Center in Taft, which is Muskogee County. It was about  twenty minutes from my home.  I used my Laubach training and certification to get in the door out there  and in fact was a literacy tutor for some time. I worked that whole fall  and into the winter as a tutor and came to know the women. It was a  great learning experience for me. I   d never been to a prison before of  any sort and you always hear about the needs, but I needed to go and see  and learn and decide, really, what sorts of things can seriously, really  impact these women. Literacy, of course, is huge.  9  Eddie Warrior had a very strong principal at that time. I have to give  great credit to Dr. H. Clint Davis who now lives in the Dallas area. He  had a very strong G.E.D.  General Education Development  program.  This is the high school equivalency program, but there was not really a  college program to speak of. Youthful offender monies were   this is  kind of in Contract with America days, when many social programs are  languishing, so there were very few women in class and they were  mainly in correspondence, now called distance learning, classes. Hands-on  teachers, modeling behavior, there to answer questions, I think that   s  a thousand times better than distance learning. However, if all you can  do is distance, I   m for the education.  I began with Dr. Davis to do some programs in the community to kind of  put a face on incarcerated women. I typically would begin:    My name is  Jane Doe, 403293, I   m one of 1,700 women incarcerated.    Tell about the  crimes, mainly it   s drugs. Surprise, surprise. Tell about the situation with  my education. Well the upshot is, Clint and I are doing these programs  and we went to the Lake Tenkiller Ladies Association, and this must  have been April of    97. A lady there from Florida, visiting family in  Oklahoma, came up to me after the program and said,    Nugget was my  friend.    Nugget was Jim   s uncle, J. Howard Edmondson, who was the  governor of Oklahoma. The fact that she   s used the family nickname has  me know that she was, in fact, a very close friend of Howard   s. She gave  me fifty dollars and wanted it for the higher education of an Eddie  Warrior woman.  Well, we had no way to cash the check. Of course, I take my problems  home, I still do, and Jim told me,    What you need is an Eleemosynary  Trust.    I crossed my eyes and    (Laughs) So anyway, I set about getting  myself an Eleemosynary Trust. So many lawyers to thank for their pro-bono  work. In May of that year, just a month later, I incorporated  Friends of the Eddie Warrior Foundation and I could cash that check.  Then comes the deal, what about the next check? Fundraising has been  my middle name, really, since that time. The family is political, we   re  well known. I got some publicity about my work at Eddie Warrior, and a  woman, a friend of mine, really kind of through Friends of the Library  years, saw me in the post office and said,    Come and see me, I   m doing  foundation allocations. I   m assuming you   re a 501(c)(3),    which of  course is an IRS designation. Well in fact, I had applied and it was  pending. That   s a very involved process, some of these things, and I was  really a fish out of water. I was just relying on the kindness of familiars  and not so much strangers. 501(c)(3)  status  came through and this  friend, my philanthropist, has sustained us ever since.  In the early years, I did probably two or three programs a month: civic  groups, ladies at the church, that sort of thing. When they would allocate  10  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  their funds, which might be six months later, I would usually get five  hundred dollars, and to me that represented three scholarships at that  time. I partner with Connors State College at Warner  Oklahoma , which  is a junior college. They have always taken such wonderful care of me.  They waived certain fees. They actually send certified teachers to the  prison. These are not distance learning experiences and it   s just been  wonderfully successful. My hero is Dr. Donnie Nero of CSC  Connors  State College . He   s the president and I understand that he is retiring and  I hope he tells his incoming president what a good deal FEW Foundation  is so that I keep my good program going.  Did you have expectations when you first went into the system?  I really was kind of shaking in my boots because of my family situation.  The Department of Corrections (DOC) was very leery of me. I had all  the earmarks of being a potential trouble maker, you know, and in subtle  ways I was kind of discouraged from    nothing overt. They didn   t want  to mess with me too much. Here   s Jim, who can call a grand jury just on  a signature and one of the things grand juries do is investigate the local  prisons and the local jails. That   s a task, no matter what the subject of  the grand jury. At least that   s the way it used to be, I   m thinking it  probably still is. It was not overt, but my stuff was so new that the idea  of a foundation    In fact, I know of no other such foundation in this  country and for years I was a member of the International Correctional  Educators Associations. I gave programs about the Friends of Eddie  Warrior Foundation in Dallas and in Portland, Oregon. With my contacts  kind of out there, especially on the national scale, I don   t know of  anything else like this. I   m hoping there are many, but to my knowledge,  my program is somewhat unique, which scared DOC. Untried,  unproven, you know, what are we messing with here? Over time, I have  proven myself a very good friend of Eddie Warrior.  My warden a few years ago, Eddie Warrior Correctional Center warden  (and I   m living over here in Oklahoma City, I don   t even go over there  weekly like I did for many years), put me up for Correctional Volunteer  of the Year. There are 20,000 volunteers out there, mainly Christian  ministry sorts of things. I was Volunteer of the Year, so I have a very,  very good relationship with the Department of Corrections. I am a  graduate of their leadership class; I did that about a year ago. We were  fortunate that a new governor came to town with a more    at the time I  started. DOC is a department of the executive. What the executive is up  to is the theme for that department. Unfortunately the governor at the  time called families of inmates scumbags and well, teachers were slobs.  He was kind of notorious for being politically incorrect and offensive to  boot. A new governor came to town, DOC began looking at alternatives  to lock the door and let no light shine upon those people that have done  11  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  wrong. Tough on crimes, how much have we heard about that? Well  now, we   re looking at being smart on crime. Incarcerate the people who  are truly dangerous to us and not the people we   re mad at who need drug  beds. Well I can   t provide drug beds, but I can provide a college  education for some of the women at Eddie Warrior Correctional Center  and I   m very happy to do so.  In the early days, up through the time when you were going constantly  over there, would you have a lot of one-on-one interaction with the  inmates?  Oh yes. I had all kinds of programs. I was trying to improve their lives  on many levels. For the first few years I had very little money to  educate. I had an Oprah   s book club. I used to go to Portland, Oregon  and there   s a wonderful bookstore there named Powell   s. I would clear  their Oprah books out. I brought an empty suitcase always when I went.  They were reading   and I was such a snob and I   m apologetic about it  now, but they were reading Sweetheart of Ridgeway High books and I  just kind of turned up my nose at them and wanted them to read more  quality work. Now I feel, especially the very young people, that  whatever they read is good. Discernment and discrimination comes with  experience.  We had Oprah   s book club. My claim to fame, far more than Friends of  Eddie Warrior Foundation, is Tales for the Rising Moon, a program I  started in January of    99 at Eddie Warrior. Inmate mothers and  grandmothers would come to me and select books, children   s books, for  their kids at home. They would audiotape these books, reading a  selection of these books, and People magazine had worked with me a  little about that time and they gave me a Polaroid camera. So I   d take a  picture of Mommy holding the books. I   d send the whole kit   n   caboodle  to the kids. This was at no cost to the inmate parent or grandparent, so it  was just, as you can imagine, wildly, wildly, successful. I am happy to  say that when Jim came to the Supreme Court and we moved to  Oklahoma City, I took the program in to Mable Bassett, and though I am  now no longer running the program, they are still running it at Eddie  Warrior and Mable   s and they   re wonderfully successful.  The heartbreak incarcerated women have as their worst guilt are those  children at home. The lucky ones are with the maternal grandmother,  some are with Daddy. Daddy may be kind of a shady character too. I  hope not, and often not, but DHS is involved. And the kids are mad, you  know, where   s Mommy? I need Mommy. They plug into their little ear  phones when they come home from school and sit down with the book  that Mommy had sent them and listen to her read it. It was really a  wonderful program and I am delighted that it is still going on at both of  12  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  those women   s prisons.  So I had a bunch of little things going on. I worked with a program  called Play Day. During Christmas break, spring break, churches around  the state would bring the children of Eddie Warrior women to the prison  for a day. It was playing all manner of games, McDonald   s treats, which  was probably more of a treat to Mommy really than the child who is  probably getting a good share of McDonald burgers, but the wonderful  programs to address some of those very serious problems. Those kids  are five times more likely than other young people to become involved  in the juvenile justice system. Grandmas raising grandbabies, that   s not  fair, you know, but it   s a loving relationship and thank God for that, but  Grandma doesn   t want to drive the 150 miles to Eddie Warrior. They   re  going to do that once or twice a year. Daddy is far more likely to bring  the kids, a couple times a month even. Various problems like that.  Many, many issues, way too few drug beds. Most people are there for  crimes that result from drug use in one way or another. I   m delighted  that our new speaker-elect, Kris Steele, author of  House Bill  2998,  which passed last session, is a partnership between the State of  Oklahoma and the Kaiser Foundation of Tulsa to do alternative  sentencing for non-violent offenders, mothers with children. I   m not sure  exactly how it all is going to work here in Oklahoma County, but it starts  in January here. It is far less disruptive and it far more successfully  addresses her needs, which are usually drug counseling, intervention,  that sort of thing, and it   s viewed a little bit as an intervention. Over  time, I came to view a single college class from Friends of Eddie  Warrior Foundation as an intervention, so profoundly is that woman   s  life changed. When she successfully competes and completes a three  hour class, she   s just,    My goodness, I   m doing the same things those  college kids are doing and I   m succeeding and not only that, I did well.     What kind of change does that make, you know? My work is more fun  for me than anybody out there, I can tell you that for sure.  And I bet really rewarding.  Very rewarding. Every once in a while I get sick of fundraising and I do  too much. I just turned sixty-five and I   m not sure how long I   m going to  keep this up. One of my very, very early students is an attorney  practicing law here in Oklahoma City and every once in a while I   ll meet  Marianne for lunch, just so I know that my work    so much of it, I never  see the outcome.  I want you to tell me about Maryanne.  Well, Marianne is Hispanic. She, as a very young Texas woman, was  13  driving through Oklahoma with a carload of marijuana on her way, I  think, to Chicago or someplace like that. Her father had gotten her  involved in this somehow. Anyway, she   s travelling with her little  brother and they are stopped in Vinita, Oklahoma and in the marijuana is  some heroin. Well, Marianne gets a very, very long sentence for  trafficking. She is a gifted linguist. She   s bilingual. English is her second  language and she is highly proficient in that. Anyway, I helped her. I had  created, in order really kind of to get my family to contribute to the  foundation, an Ed Edmondson Memorial award. This is named for my  father-in-law. My mother-in-law was always very happy to fund that.  Well, Marianne won an Ed Edmondson Memorial Scholarship early on.  Due to the fact that she got her associate of arts degree at Eddie Warrior  (that   s as high as we go; Connors is a junior college) when parole time  came, they were very impressed, the parole boards, with this girl, you  know. She was extremely young when the crime occurred and I forget  how many years she served, but she was released. She returned to her  native Texas and got her Bachelor   s. She still had some kind of parole  obligation to Oklahoma, so Jim and I helped her return to Claremore, I  guess, I forget the county seat. She got post-conviction relief, which is  an open court hearing and no objection from the district attorney who  kind of looked at her as,    You go, girl.    Thank God he was a human  being because others, you know, are not. Well, they   re notches in that  big six-shooter.  Marianne   s done with any obligations to the Pardon and Parole Board of  the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. This is wonderful. Well, she  wants to apply to law school and has wonderful LSAT grades, which is  the test you take to see if you qualify for law school. She applied at  OCU right here in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City University. To their  credit, it   s a private school, it   s affiliated with the Methodist Church.  They said,    Marianne, we   d love to admit you, but we   d charge you all  this money. You   d have all these loans and at the end we are afraid that  you will not be able to practice law because the Oklahoma Bar  Association has a no felon rule.    Well, I got on my hands and knees and  so did Jim Edmondson and other people that I know. Many, many  people helped Marianne along the way. She was admitted. We said we   ll  face that when the time comes. The time came; she graduated and did  very well.  Jim and I, who by now is a justice on the Supreme Court, I, Suzanne, am  the Friends of Eddie Warrior woman; we testified before the Oklahoma  Board of Bar Examiners. They are on a case by case basis, looking at  these problem graduations. Wonderful Dr. Davis, my old principal, came  up from Texas, so many people that cared about her, testified and she  was ultimately given a full license. She is a fully accredited attorney at  14  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  law.  Well, now our next thing is she can practice law and do all these  wonderful things, but she can   t vote. So, many letters went to Governor  Henry regarding Marianne and she was granted a full pardon. So she   s  out there voting and having lunch with me now and again to, you know,  pep me up. She   s a beautiful young woman. Her practice is Hispanic.  She does criminal work and civil work. She   s making a big difference in  a lot of lives herself and I   m very, very proud of her.  It   s great how now she can give back, too.  Oh, absolutely. So many of the women that I have met in prison who are  soon to go out, their plans, they want to do social work kind of stuff and  I consider myself a social worker without a portfolio. It always is to help  women, to intervene, to stop before it goes to this point of incarceration.  That dovetails so nicely with the attention being paid right now to  Oklahoma   s incarcerated women. Based on population, we incarcerate  more women than any other state in the Union. The United States is  notorious worldwide for being a high incarcerator. I suspect we   re the  highest in the world.  Well, good things are happening. We can   t afford this stuff that we   re  doing and we   re not providing drug care, drug counseling; these people  are addicts. They need help and education has its role. That can change  right there. And of course, my women are sober. It   s an enforced    you  haven   t dealt with the addiction, but you   re not using at this moment,  you   re going to college. Religion is a contributing factor, too. Many  women    find the Lord    in prison and it   s very understandable because  it   s a gospel of forgiveness and a gospel of hope. So, the little three  legged school; education, religion and address those addictions.  Sometimes AA/NA  Alcoholics Anonymous/Narcotics Anonymous  is  enough and I   m very hopeful this Kaiser Foundation/ State of Oklahoma  partnership will deal with that first thing. That   s going to be the focus:  get this person well. Have this person be a taxpayer and not a tax drain  because we can   t afford her.  So let me get this straight. There is no drug or alcohol counseling in the  jails?  There is very little. That never was my area of expertise, but so few beds  for people that know about such things    it   s not uncommon for a  serious drug treatment program to take many months, and I don   t really  understand all about that, but they   re the experts and I believe them.  You mentioned briefly earlier about working at the Oklahoma County  15  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Jail. Could you tell me a little bit about what you   re doing there?  Yes. Well, just kind of serendipity. When Jim was appointed to the  Supreme Court, it was on the front page of the Sunday Oklahoman and a  lot of it was about my prison work because over the years I have gotten  some publicity that has been very good because it   s helped other places  start these programs. I   m delighted when they get going, especially  Tales has been very popular and it   s kind of here and there. Someone  read that; a woman that used to volunteer at Mable Basset, a friend of  mine. She   s an attorney. We met for lunch. I was looking, what   s next? I  can   t go to Eddie Warrior anymore, what now? I always intended to  continue the Foundation, but in terms of hands-on volunteer work. An  Episcopal priest, who is a friend of mine, connected me with another  woman who was kind of casting about, looking for some meaningful  volunteer work and we three met and we   d all read Wally Lamb   s  Couldn   t Keep it to Myself. He   s an author who was doing a writing  program in a Connecticut women   s prison and he   d compiled a book of  their writings. They were extraordinary, and we thought,    That   s doable,  cheap; it   s a paper and a pen and a prompt.     Always a little bit difficult is a new program. The people that run the  show, the sheriffs, the wardens are a little    they   re not so keen on new  programs. However, my dear friend, Oklahoma County Court Clerk,  Patricia Presley, we three met with Patty and how to take this, how to  present this to the sheriff and take a program, a writing program, into  Oklahoma County Jail. He was wonderful. Opened the doors for us. We,  just this fall, had our third anniversary. I will go there the day after  tomorrow; every Wednesday from 2:00 to 4:30 we   re there. We   ve had  gifted students. The wonderful thing about Writing Through Walls is  that it   s not designed as therapy, but there are therapeutic aspects to  writing things out. It   s contributing to the tranquility of the county jail.  People upset, usually about their kids, something going on at home that  they cannot do anything about, they   ll go write that out instead of  punching somebody or who knows, throwing food, whatever one would  do. Our sheriff is very supportive of our program and we   d love to see it  expand. It  consists of  facilitators, prompts, pencil and paper.  What do you do with the stories?  Well, we have several prompts. We only write for fifteen minutes, which  is    well, that   s about as long as our attention span goes. Each woman is  allowed to select one writing for us to take home. We three divide the  writings. We edit, type up, and comment; only positive comments. There  is no constructive criticism even; we   ll correct the spellings and what  not. When they quickly write, you know, we   re not at our best in terms  of punctuation and spelling and we just don   t even worry about that.  16  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  After the woman has been with us for eight weeks, she gets a certificate  that declares that she is a writer. Writers write  She is also given a chap  book, which is a compilation of all the writings that we three have taken  home, put on beautiful paper and it is bound with a ribbon and from that  point on, every writing that woman turns into us is put on pretty paper  and hole punched and added. They   re very, very proud of their chap  books. Oklahoma County Bench and many of the lawyers down there  are aware of our program, so women going from the jail to sentencing  want their judges to see the chap book and,    I   ve been using my time  well, your Honor.     We have a good bit of support downtown and that pleases us very much.  We three feel very much that we are learning far more than our women  are and that   s usually the way those things go. They don   t know about  meter and that sort of thing, let alone iambic pentameter or anything like  that. (Laughs) They   re natural poets and the rhythm of their work. We  often don   t change even grammatically incorrect things if the woman   s  voice is coming through very clearly. So as editors it   s very interesting  to us and we enjoy our work very much.  I bet some of the stories are quite     Oh, they   re wonderful  You know, we all puddle up at times. (Laughs)  My husband calls us, we three facilitators, the Wailing Muses, the  Weeping Muses, whatnot because we too go deep sometimes, Christmas  memories and those sorts of things and we   re very sensitive. It   s such a  lovely group. The jail is highly transient. We have new people coming in  at least monthly. We   ve become very supportive of each other. It   s two  and a half hours a week out of your cell with other people and nice  ladies. So it   s a very good thing.  You   ve had this great story, getting involved, meandering through, can  you tell me about any stumbling blocks or adversity you   ve faced along  the way?  Just at first at Eddie Warrior. Really kind of my background. I had the  potential    Drew had just been elected Attorney General too, besides  Jim being the District Judge for the county. I kind of looked like I might  be coming out to cause them trouble and there were subtle things.  Were you ever afraid to use your name?  Well yes, in fact, I went in as Suzanne Williams. My fear was that Jim  had sentenced one of the women and there would be anger with him. I  fessed up after awhile. I   m Suzanne Edmondson and they knew the  Edmondson name, of course. I met people Jim had sentenced. He   s such  17  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  a humane man that they liked him, you know, and sometimes he   d given  more than one chance to someone and,    I really messed up, I kept doing  it, I didn   t listen to him and he sent me here and I will go home and  never disobey the court again     type stuff. (Laughs) I don   t know what I  was thinking, hostage    Well you   re scared when you go into a prison,  you   ve never been there before, the women are all dressed alike. There   s  a guard at the gate when you come in. I went in a few times with media  and television as well as the People Magazine print people and I   m sure  they feared that, people will want to come in and write about the fact  that this woman is volunteering out here. Only favorable publicity.  In fact, years before I really felt accepted by senior DOC, my warden,  that sort of person, my program, Friends of Eddie Warrior was being  bragged about at these national    all the wardens getting together. You  know, well in Oklahoma, we have a private foundation that is     (Laughs)    That   s not fair, you   re giving me all this grief, you don   t want  me here     It just took time. It took time and it needed somebody at the  top who was not disrespecting everyone that had to do with the  Department of Corrections: volunteers, inmates, I mean we   re all human  beings. The more I work with the incarcerated, the more convinced I am  that we have far more in common than we have that separates us. These  are our daughters, our mothers, our neighbors, our sisters. Ninety-seven  percent of them rejoin society. How much better if they   re educated, if  their addiction issues have been addressed, let   s make a taxpayer out of  that person. Let   s re-integrate them and consider that they paid their debt  to society.  Well tell me about some big highlights for you.  Well, goodness.  There has to be many.  Well, yes. I still go to graduations when I can. Eddie Warrior has them  twice a year and sometimes some of my women are getting their  associate of arts degrees. Well, this year I provided grants to 110 women  who would not have gone. My women are always the incarcerated  qualified indigent women of Eddie Warrior Correctional Center, so they  can   t go to college on their own. Youthful Offender monies has  increased federally. Well, the monies have not increased, eligibility has.  Used to be, Youthful Offender was someone up to age twenty-five.  They   ve moved that to thirty-five, which of course incorporates more  eligible people. They didn   t increase the funding. So I   m kind of the  biggest college presence at my prison there.  We have a few fortunate women who can self pay. You know, they have  18  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  wherewithal on the outside, usually family and there are some tribes that  have stepped up and are paying for their women. I did for awhile and we  just kind of visited about that. How much better if your citizen comes  home educated and ready to take her place as a law abiding member of  your community? So they   ve been very helpful. Different religions,  different churches have given many scholarships. Here in Oklahoma  City, Mayflower Congregational Church has just been absolutely  wonderful, as has the First Unitarian Church. I   m an equal opportunity  money gatherer. (Laughter) I was with the American Association of  University Women, AAUW. They had a meeting on Saturday here with  the ladies in Edmond. They slipped me a few bucks, so if I have money  today, somebody   s in college tomorrow. I have always been handing  out, I have never been interested in having a big principal and I only  spend the interest. Well I   m not in the position to accumulate a huge  principal. FEW Foundation has no employees and no overhead, so every  cent that comes to FEW Foundation goes to tuition or books. And I   m a  lending library. I   ve spent  1700 on eight math books. Argh. (Laughs)  But they   ll be used this semester and next semester and so on until  they   re tattered or the volume changes and a new book is issued or  something like that. I   d far rather pay for tuition than books, as you can  imagine.  So graduation is always a big highlight, what are some others?  I used to have wonderful fun when one of my women who   d read for me  to her children and I   d mailed home books and I   d get to meet the kids  on Play Day. It was just always so darling. One little bitty was there with  Momma or Grandma. Generations are pretty close with women in  prison. I once had a twenty-six year old grandmother read to her  grandbaby. Sometimes you don   t know whether it   s mom or grandma.  Anyway, the little kid standing there, she brought him over to meet me.     This is the lady that sent you the books and took the picture of me.    He  started telling me the story verbatim. He knew that story so well. It was  the sort of thing that he would come home from kindergarten or  whatever and plug in, listen to Momma and read the book and have his  cookies and milk or whatever, but that was his routine. Those stories are  fun.   There are  fun stories about girls that have been released. I spread my  money very, very thinly since a single class can be such a life altering  experience. So usually, my women have been with me for a very long  time to get their Associate   s or they came into prison with some college  hours and just knowing that    Well let me just go on with what I was  saying. If I   ve got somebody close to discharge and close to  their  AA   associates of arts , that woman can have seven classes this semester. I  want her to leave with the AA in hand. Just kind of through hearsay sorts  19  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  of things, I   m still close to some of the teachers over at Eddie Warrior,     So and so got out, she went up to Missouri. She went to the journalism  school at Missouri, you know it   s very famous and a very good one. We  know that she   s working as a reporter doing such and so.    Those things  are rare when I really find out what happened next because we lose them  into the wider world and hope that they continue and get their  Bachelor   s or hopefully their Associate   s is enough and finds them a fine  job. Helps them find a fine job that will feed their children and keep the  wolf from the door. So, always those are extraordinarily wonderful  things.  It was huge to get Volunteer of the Year. That took me totally by  surprise. I had no idea my name had been submitted and that was just  very, very nice. A few times here in Oklahoma City, I   ve been at lunch  and a former student has waited on me and I   m seven years out of Eddie  Warrior now, so the women that are students today are not women that I  know. I know their names because I keep pretty careful records and do  write the checks and things and when I go to Eddie Warrior, it   s great  fun to put a face with that name. Jim   s been commencement speaker and  they   re lovely to us. Last time I was there I got a plaque from Eddie  Warrior Correctional Center,    To our greatest friend.    I have a little  alcove in my office where it   s beginning to fill up with these things. It   s  so strange because for so many years I worked in the system with a  sense of anonymity even though the press had been with me some. I  mean I continued after the press left and I was there weekly and  sometimes daily. When you   re ten years out, the awards the DAR folks,  the lovely honors I   ve gotten, it was a shock. I expected that I would be  even more anonymous in Oklahoma City and actually the awards started  here and it   s a very nice feeling.  Speaking of awards, when you were notified that you were going to be  inducted into the Hall of Fame, what was going on in your mind?  I was astonished and humbled. I felt a bit like an impostor.  Why is that?  Oh, I don   t know. It seems to me that I   m doing very reasonable things  and not extraordinary things and that is I   m sure somewhat because I   ve  been doing it so long and there is kind of that sense of the anonymity.  Well, it has to do with me living here and my women are there, you  know, it   s two and a half hours away. I   m not really intimately involved  with it anymore. I fund it and I write the checks and I don   t know the  women and I don   t know their struggles and I don   t know their stories. It  was a wonderful surprise. One of the things I said when I had my  opportunity to speak, besides having the governor in the audience,    We  20  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  need more drug beds, Governor,    put my little plug in. I feel and felt that  by honoring me, the worth of my women was acknowledged and that  makes me want to cry. There is a change afoot and I   m part of it and I  am so glad I was able to make a difference and I am surprised really that  it was I who founded a foundation, I mean that would never have  occurred to me. I say evolution, it   s a series of events and one thing  leads to another and all of a sudden you look around and here it is. I feel  very grateful to women that I consider my mentors and my advocates in  the community.  Such as?  Well, just up front, Justice Yvonne Kauger, a sister member of the  Women   s Hall of Fame. Since we   ve moved to the city, she   s been  promoting me to go do this, go meet these people, and you need to talk  to them. I said,    Yvonne, you   re just so good to me.    She said,    You   re  doing the Lord   s work,    and I guess I am.  And she presented you?  (Laughter) Yes, she did. She talked a whole lot about Drew and Jim.  She   s been close to so many members of my family, including Ed.  Yvonne is so involved in Sovereignty Symposium; she   s the reason  there is a Sovereignty Symposium. Her very first one, my father-in-law  was still alive and he was the former congressman, but he helped her get  major funding out of Washington, D.C. All roads lead to Justice Kauger,  I guess. (Laughs) I   m going to have dinner with her tonight.  What does this type of honor mean to you?  Well, it is profoundly validating. I can go anywhere in the Oklahoma  Department of Corrections and be respected. I no longer have to prove  myself and that   s such a shortcut. It is just such a wonderful thing to be  able to go into a place, bring a program and not go through the hoops of  worry that staff may have about,    Is she going to incite anyone to riot?     (Laughs)     I   m saying that flippantly, of course.  You   re not there to cause trouble.  No, I   m not. I truly am a friend of Eddie Warrior, but it took me a long  time. It was three wardens later when I really felt accepted at Eddie  Warrior and I   ll say his name: Warden Eric Franklin. He was wonderful  and I was delighted to be welcomed and to welcome you to Eddie  Warrior.  Well how do you feel that now people look at you as a role model? And  21  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  this is on many levels.  Well, I suppose I don   t know. You live long enough. (Laughter) Gosh, I  hope that I would be a model for someone confronted with a pretty good  sized problem and that person maybe would think, well I took college  into a kind of reluctant atmosphere. Little by little, step by step, as one is  purposeful and careful, I have always tried to be very diplomatic. I don   t  pull rank on anybody. I am here as a woman who has this notion. Here   s  what I think about how I   m going to go about it. What do you think?  That, of course, moves mountains far more easily than,    I   ll get a grand  jury out here, by god, if you   re mean to me.    (Laughs)  Jim used to tease me when I was first going to Eddie Warrior,    Are you  taking a bail bondsman today?    I said,    If I   m not home for dinner,  come get me     Well, we   ve had fun with that. I have had no serious  problems. There were just little covert discouragements that had I been  less determined, I   d have run away. I really would have. So, keep your  eye on the prize. Well, I didn   t know what the prize was. I didn   t know it  was going to be a foundation and all of that, but there are logical  progressions and logical steps and each one is challenging. For me to  incorporate, what do I know about going to the Secretary of State and  becoming a foundation? Now I can tell you because I learned little by  little by little. I was wonderfully assisted by members of the Oklahoma  Bar Association and they have my eternal thanks. Many women at Eddie  Warrior have them to thank, as well.  What are your hopes for the foundation into the future?  Well, I   m giving that some thought now. I have a wonderful board. My  primary philanthropist, a wonderful lady, is eighty-something. I am now  sixty-something. I feel that I will keep Friends of Eddie Warrior going  personally as long as it   s easy. I don   t really feel energetic enough to go  to three or four meetings a month and give a program and maybe get   1500. That   s substantial and I very much appreciate the clubs and  groups that have given me money. It   s just such a hard way; it   s an  exhausting way and I just kind of don   t think that I have the energy for  that anymore. I have recently met with people at Oklahoma City  Community Foundation, which is an umbrella foundation for many.  Donna Nigh, Governor and Mrs. Nigh have a foundation and it is  administered by Oklahoma City Community Foundation. It may be at  some point that I, with the permission of my board of directors   all of  this would go to the board and be discussed thoroughly, it would maybe  go under the auspices of that fine organization.  For the now, I   m feeling pretty perky and my friend, my philanthropist,  Lord knows is a ball of fire. She may be cruising the islands as we  22  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  speak. She   s a wonderful human being and has been; she   s the true  friend of Eddie Warrior. She   s made a difference in many, many lives.  She likes my little group because there   s no overhead. She gets more  bang for the buck, and she does indeed.  Well you   ve mentioned many people that have helped you through this  process. Is there anyone else you   d like to make mention of at this time?  Oh, gosh yes. A retired lawyer helped me incorporate, his name is Kay  Wilson. Kay was very wonderful to me. He is the late Kay Wilson at this  time, but I loved that man and he would occasionally show up for Eddie  Warrior things if there was something kind of fun and ceremonial going  on. Jim Edmondson helped me more than anybody, of course, and  continues to be my main sustainer. John Morris Williams at the  Oklahoma Bar Association, he   s the executive director down there, has   helped a lot . I wrote, a year ago, an article for the Oklahoma Bar  Journal that comes out every week or every two weeks and it was  published and I thanked so many lawyers along the path. My lawyer to  this day is Ron Wright and Ron did everything pro-bono. Tim Larason  in this city, a high dollar, wonderful attorney did a lot of work for me for   28.10, the cost of copies. I have been the recipient of so many  kindnesses like that and they get gold stars in my book.  Well if you could give advice to Oklahomans, what would you tell them?  I would say,    Oklahoma, the people we are incarcerating are our  children and our neighbors. We   re sending them away for far too long.  We can   t afford the system that we   ve built up. Building more prisons  does not solve our problems. Ninety-seven percent of the people we  incarcerate come home and how much better if they   re educated and  reunited with their families and they   re drug free and they can become  taxpayers and live good lives? Jesus Christ asked,    Have you visited  those in prison?    As a God fearing, Christian state, the reddest of the red,  I think we need to pay attention to His words and the way He lived.  Let   s be more charitable to the last and the least because they can  become the best and the strong and be our neighbors and the good  citizens of our community. We have to address their drug problems and  their lack of education and I would love for you to help me in this  work.     You   ve lived in Oklahoma for quite some time now     Yes, since we moved here in    74. Oklahoma City and Muskogee and  back to Oklahoma City. Not everywhere in the state, but I feel very  much an Oklahoman.  23  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oh, goodness. Well, when Jim and I were newly-weds and first living in  Oklahoma, we   d probably been married four years or five and I was in a  grocery store and standing next to me was a little bitty black lady and  she was talking to the meat. I edged away from her and then she,    Oh,  can you believe these prices,    and then she turned those brown eyes to  me, she was speaking to me. I   d never been spoken to in a grocery store  before. Now, I chit chat in line all the time. I love that about Oklahoma.  I love its friendliness and acceptance and its goodwill.  I love its weather, except when it   s 115  degrees . I   m not too keen on  the really hot end of that, but I have a misting fan, so I   m able to sit out  in my garden. I love gardening and I love the fact that the season is so  long and that my flowers lasted until just a week ago. That   s unheard of.  I have my best friends here. I have made such good friends and feel very  much an Oklahoman. I   ve decided at some point that I could never catch  up on all the Edmondson family history and no longer try, but I know  enough to get by. I enjoy Jim   s family very much, I think it is a  distinguished family and I   m very proud to be a member of. I   m grateful  for my adult children and my eleven-year-old grandson Jackson.  I   m grateful for Christmas and the goodwill of so many. During difficult  times in my life, I have felt very sustained by the many who held me up.  I   m certain that they did and I don   t want to live any place else, except I  was just a week ago in Key West and I want to move there, but not  really. Maybe just part of the year.  It   s nice to visit.  (Laughter) Yes, exactly, exactly. I don   t want to be there hurricane  season, I   d rather face tornadoes.  Well, if you could give advice to those who want to follow in your  footsteps and work in the ways you have worked, what would you tell  them?  I would say that very many things can be done in the present for very  little cost. The children   s bedtime story program that I ran, donated  books came to me by the bushel basket. I was giving a program one time  to, I think it was DAR ladies, and one of the ladies in the audience, her  son was an author of children   s books. Hundreds came to me. Once the  word is out that you   re looking for, you need X, it will appear. Churches  supported me with the postage stamps. Help is there. There are so many  goodhearted people. Especially with a program for the children. We all  24  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  feel for those little kids that are doing without their mommies, and some,  daddies are in prison, too. Mom and Dad were arrested together for  manufacturing or whatever. That is a very good place to start is working  on the children   s causes.  My writing program is very, very simple and inexpensive and it provides  a wonderful release. A book could come out of this easily, out of your  work. You and a couple of friends go into a prison and have a writing  program; you   ll love it. It   ll take a somewhat different form than the one  I have at the jail, but it will be truly satisfying and it will be helpful. It  contributes to the tranquility, to the well-being of the people that are  involved in that class. The side benefit, it contributes to your well-being.  A long time ago, I discovered that to find myself, I had to give myself  away. There   s nothing I believe more than that. Volunteering in a good  program is an extraordinary gift to you and a gift to the ones that you are  there to serve.  Well I have one more question, but is there anything else before I ask  that question that you   d like to add that we haven   t spoken about today?  No, that   s pretty much it. I had so many little things, just little things at  Eddie Warrior. No, I think that   s pretty much it.  Well then, when history is written about you, whether you think it   s  going to be or not, what would you like for it to say?  Gosh. I would like it known, and this kind of comes to me from my  husband, that even though I was afraid, I kept after it and my husband  calls that courage. I have come to believe that myself. Even when I  didn   t fully believe in myself that I could do such and so, if I took baby  steps, I had a lighted path and it was clear to me, but sometimes I was  afraid to move, so I stood in place until that step became familiar to me  and that familiarity gave me a chance to think too, a time to reflect on  what I   m up to and then I find myself able to move down the path a little  bit.  It took me quite a long time to really come from that first fifty dollars  that that woman gave to me to my average number of women I give  grants to each semester,  which  is fifty-six. Now that didn   t happen just  overnight. And there were lots of little steps along the way. There was  lots of fundraising efforts, I went to meetings I didn   t want to and gave  programs that got to be a little boring to me because it was the same old  same old. Hang in there, keep going, keep trying and whatever you  accomplish will be something that wasn   t there before or something that  is better than anything that was there before.  25  Nykolaiszyn  Edmondson  Build on someone else   s work. Come to Eddie Warrior and make my  work even more wonderful. Educate every woman out there and then go  across the street to Jess Dunn, the men   s prison. I was always a little  afraid to go into the men   s prison, so I   ve always focused on the women,  but you   re braver than I am. Go to Jess Dunn and get that college  program going. Bring Tales for the Rising Moon, the bedtime story to  them. They have children at home, too. How lovely it would be for those  little kids to receive a package from Daddy with a bunch of pretty books  and an audio tape of him reading to you. So, go for it.  Suzanne, thank you so much for your time today. We really appreciate it.  You   re welcome, I   ve enjoyed it. (Laughs)  -------  -------
