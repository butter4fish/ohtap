 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Tuesday, August 21, 2007 and I am in Lewisville,  Texas interviewing Dr. Valree Fletcher Wynn. This interview is being  conducted as part of the inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame Oral History Project. Dr. Wynn was inducted into the Oklahoma  Women   s Hall of Fame in 1996. She was the first African American to  earn both her master   s and PhD in English from Oklahoma State  University. Dr. Wynn   s career in education has been filled with many  firsts and she has received numerous honors over the years. Thank you  for joining us today, Dr. Wynn.  Thank you  Let   s begin today by learning more about you. Could you start with  where you grew up and give a little background on your early life?  I grew up in Southwestern Oklahoma  Sentinel, Oklahoma  where my  father was a sharecropper and farmed about 450 acres of land. In the  area where we lived, there was no school for blacks. My parents decided  to send me to a nearby town  Hobart, Oklahoma  to stay with a couple  recommended to them. This lasted about a month and my parents  decided I needed to come home. After all I was only seven years old.  Later my father obtained a petition from the county seat  at Cordell  and  with the required number of signatures, we had permission to build a  school in our area. There were about 25 black children whose parents  were very happy.  My mother had taught me to read before I started school. So the first  day, the teacher gave me a book (one after another) and told me to read  until I missed a word and that would be the grade she would put me in.  That is how I started school in the third grade.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  When the year ended, the building was mysteriously burned to the  ground. But I had a very determined father. He and several friends  constructed a brush arbor for that summer. So, we went to school under  this brush arbor. When winter came he moved all the benches inside and  we had school in our house. That   s how much my parents valued  education.  That area of Oklahoma was very segregated. But the white family whose  land we farmed was from Kansas and they were some of the most  delightful people I   ve ever met. There were several members of them  scattered out over the community. Their great-granddaughter was my  best friend. Here was an island of acceptance and we visited back and  forth. My father and her father played dominoes while our mothers  sewed and we played. It was delightful. And when we went to the  movies she sat in the balcony with me. I asked her,    Do they ever tease  you about this?    And she said,    That doesn   t matter.    But it made for a  very, very pleasant situation, an oasis in that desert of segregation.  When they said you were going to be in the third grade, how old were  you?  I was either seven or eight.  And that one-room school house that was built, did it have a name?  Funny you should ask that. I didn   t put it on this list of schools I  attended because it is no more. And the last time my mother and I visited  Sentinel, there was only one black in the county and he was a very, very  old man. There are probably no blacks in Washita county now.  Would you like to talk about any of the other schools you attended  growing up?  When I finished the eighth grade, I was sent to Lawton to stay with  family friends and attend high school. Again, I had to leave my parents  and travel 80 miles back and forth on weekends, passing a high school to  get to a high school. But it turned out well and I finished high school in  1939. Douglass High School had a faculty of wonderful teachers who  seemed to take a personal interest in me. And the bonus was that I was  near a library where I could develop my passion for reading.  Upon graduation from high school, I was sent to Pueblo, Colorado, to  stay with an aunt and uncle and attend a junior college. I should have  gotten a degree in walking because it was quicker to walk to the college  than it was to ride the street cars. This was my first experience in an  integrated system and I had to make a tremendous adjustment. I could  6  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  not believe that students of other races (teachers, too) accepted me as an  equal and were my friends. It was a totally new (and pleasant)  experience.  In the fall of 1941, I came to Langston University. I lost credits by  transferring from a quarter system to a semester system, but I managed  to graduate on time. I had received such a good background in Colorado  that I was exempted from several classes at Langston. Social life was  great until World War II took away all the eligible young men. We spent  our time studying, playing bridge, and writing love letters. There were  three published teachers on the English faculty. I had found my niche. I  became an English major.  What was Langston like in the    40s? Driving by now on the highway,  you see lots of buildings. Were there lots of buildings on campus?  No, no. When I went on the Board of Regents, I saw a list of  appropriations for various schools. The total budget for Langston was  laughable. I remember that the salary they paid the groundskeepers was  not enough to pay one person, and no one person could take care of that  huge campus. So much more was needed and the same was true at  Douglass  in Lawton . The equipment that we got was the equipment  that Lawton High had used and no longer needed. The band uniforms,  the football uniforms, and the books were almost unusable. Some books  had pages torn out of them and there were stains on the uniforms. We  had never had anything else so we thought we were supposed to have  worn-out football equipment, stained uniforms, and torn library books.  OSU  Oklahoma State University  was also a new experience. There  was a time when blacks were not admitted but when I came to OSU as a  graduate student, they welcomed me with open arms. The PhD program  in English had just been put in place and I was to be the first full-time  student (the trial balloon). Optimistically, I enrolled in twelve hours the  first semester. Realistically, I dropped to nine hours the second. It took  my husband, my friends, my co-workers and the good Lord to get me  through. One instructor came to me in class one day and handed me a  paper that I had written for the class and said,    I didn   t know you were  that intelligent.    That statement remained with me the entire while I was  at OSU. In the integrated situation, I always had to    prove    myself.  I remember once I was in the hall waiting for someone. A student who  was assisting the janitor came by and said,    Well, how do you like our  program?    I said,    I think it   s pretty nice.    He said,    I heard you were  out here and I just wondered how it was going.    When I came out from  my orals for my master   s, another asked,    What was it like?    You know,  they   not just the faculty and the students, but even the people that  7  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  swept the building knew that I was there. And every eye was on me.  Someone who changed my life? John Milstead at OSU was the best  thing that could have happened to my academic career. He told me,    I   ll  take you as a student and I   ll make a scholar out of you.    He demanded  (and got) 100  from every student in his classes. He showed me how to  move from a fact-bound student to a thinking scholar. When he handed  me a syllabus on the first day of class, I stared in disbelief at the more  than twenty-five single-spaced pages that we were to use as resources.  At the end of the course that syllabus was wrinkled, dog-eared and full  of coffee and tear stains but I was a totally changed person. I had  learned  He allowed us to think for ourselves, but if we could not  support our ideas with much research, he would nail us to the wall  He  taught me how to learn. I   ll never forget him  Well, let   s jump back for a second, back to your youth. When you were  younger, what were some of your favorite subjects in school? Was it  always English?  Choosing a career was easy for me because I had always liked to read.  Any course that had a lot of reading appealed to me. I even found  geography interesting. I didn   t like math, because in math you are so  fenced in. Two and two are four and that   s that. But in language and  literature and reading, you can travel the world. I began my literary  journey with the western writer Zane Grey, and I read all of his works.  As a result, I fell in love with literature. Then when I went to Lawton to  live, I was about four blocks from the library. I read over a hundred  books while I was in high school, in addition to my school work.  Reading fascinated me. That   s why I decided to become an English  major. It was a journey that has given me much pleasure and a  rewarding career. Consider the following poem by Emily Dickinson:  I always think the cover of a book  is like a door  Which opens into someone   s house  where I   ve not been before.  A pirate or fairy queen  may lift the latch for me.  I always wonder when I knock  what welcome there will be.  Literature does open the door to the wonderful world of the imagination  and permits us to enjoy the best that has been thought and said in all  times.  8  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  I had a delightful experience with my daughter-in-law in North Carolina.  She suggested I share with her some of the great novels. I gave her a list  and she read through that list and enjoyed it. Now we can share these  books together.  What are some of the books on that list?  Let   s see, there was Tess of the D'urbervilles, Vanity Fair and The Vicar  of Wakefield. We studied the English novel in sequence of its  development. There   s one book, Tristram Shandy, where the hero (of the  book) is not born until halfway through the book. There   s a chapter in it  on noses and a chapter on aprons. But it tells us that this is the way  literature is moving. Literature has moved from objective reality to  subjective reality. The whole idea of reality is located inside the mind.  And the author of Tristram Shandy saw this as the novel developed.  That was pretty much the idea of my dissertation, that a work can be best  understood if you recognize these two realities, objective and subjective.  Most of what you read nowadays is back to the objective reality because  to go inward is difficult. It doesn   t make sense because the mind doesn   t  flow in a natural ordered pattern. You have to impose a pattern on your  thinking. That   s what Dr. Milstead taught me in romantic poetry. That   s  the direction writers are going, toward internal reality.  My adviser was off campus and when I took my orals, another professor  sat in. He told me in a nice way, what he thought about my dissertation.  He said it could all be summed up in a few sentences.    Oh,    I said,    Dr.  So-and-So, at least spare me a paragraph, maybe a page.    I had worked  on it two years and he was dismissing it, which let me know that he did  not understand modern literature. An instructor can be so learned in one  area and so limited in another. (I learned that in graduate school).  All right, well, outside of reading and embracing literature when you  were younger, what else did you like to do for fun?  I cut out pictures of movie stars and made scrapbooks with them and I  also learned to sew. Santa Claus brought me a little sewing machine. I  have shifted around so much that I   ve lost so many of my belongings but  I still have that little sewing machine. You could clamp it on a desk, roll  the little wheel and it made a chain stitch. My mother gave me a piece of  cloth and I made twelve doll outfits. Oh, I got the biggest kick out of that  little machine.  My mother was determined that I was going to be a home economics  major but I just didn   t like to cook. I just refused to learn how to cook.  (Laughing) It just didn   t capture my fancy. The thing that I was good at  9  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  was reading and English offered me that opportunity. So, I became a  English major. I have an article that I took out of a magazine,    What  does one do with an English Major?    But I always remind critics that  Barry Switzer, former coach at the University of Oklahoma, was an  undergraduate English major. (Laughter)  And now look at him, you know? Now, when you were younger, you are  this little girl and you move from Texas to Oklahoma, as you are  running around reading and sewing, what did you think you were going  to be when you got older?  Oh, a teacher, I always knew that.  No question?  No, mm-mm, no, I always wanted to be a teacher. That   s the only  profession that I knew anything about. The people who were engaged  professionally that I knew were women beauty shop operators,  preachers, funeral home operators, and teachers. That   s about the size of  it. So, those were the only careers I was familiar with and it   s good they  coincided with my desire.  Can you tell me some of your role models who you looked up to during  that time, when you were younger?  As for role models, Reba Chaney was the teacher that I chose to  emulate. She was everything that I wanted to be. She was an excellent  teacher who gave each student time, patience, and understanding. She  made us feel very special and we blossomed into confident and  admirable young women because of the self-esteem she inspired in each  of us.  My greatest role model was my dear, wonderful mother who was one of  the most remarkable women on earth. She saw something in me that was  worthy of her love and care. I was her priority in life and everything that  I have achieved in life I owe to her. My parents were divorced when I  was a senior in high school and our lives were changed suddenly and  drastically, but Mother managed, somehow, to keep me in college. Four  years later I had a bachelor   s degree from Langston University. College  was to me a spiritual journey and my guiding light and guardian angel  was my mother. Oh, I was older before it came to me one day that I  couldn   t have done any of it if I hadn   t had some kind of spiritual  guidance or some kind of creator touching my life. My religion, my  social training, everything came from my mother.  When I was a senior in college, I decided I had gone to school enough. I  10  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  had gone to school all my life and I wasn   t going to go back to school  that semester. We were living in Wichita, Kansas then. War had broken  out and Mother was working for Boeing Aircraft. I proudly announced  to Mother,    You know Mother, I don   t think I   ll go back to school this  year. I think I   ve had enough of school and I   m going to do thus and so  and so forth.    And Mother had a very unique way of raising one  eyebrow. She raised that one eyebrow and looked at me. She didn   t  comment and as we were getting ready for bed she said,    What time  does the bus leave in the morning?    I said,    9:30.    I was on that bus     and that was the end of that.  My mother always seemed to know what was right for me and she set  my course in that direction. Every step of the way she was there for me.  I was number one until my older son was born. He became the apple of  her eye. Every summer he would spend three weeks with her  in Clovis,  New Mexico . Each loved the other unconditionally. She was the single  greatest influence on his life. He gives me much credit but I think his  grandmother deserves more.  Now, Reba Cheney, what grade did she teach? And where was this at?  She was in Lawton at Douglass and she taught home economics. At that  time we did what we called    roomed with one another.    She roomed  with the same family that I roomed with so I got to see her the whole  year. She was from Oklahoma City but she taught in Lawton most of her  time.  Now, you spoke a lot about your mother. Tell me about the rest of your  family, are you an only child? Tell me about your husband and your  children     That is a subject that I don   t care to go into because I was adopted.  Okay  It   s the best thing that ever happened to me because my real mother had  no interest in education. The person that I call mother was my adopted  mother. The mother who gave birth to me was her sister and she lived in  Los Angeles.  My husband worked at Sheppard Air Force Base  Sheppard was home to  an airplane   engine mechanical school . It was one of the largest  aircraft training school and they did training manuals. It was so  interesting because before they could finish a manual, it was obsolete.  That   s how fast progress moved. An equal employment opportunity  officer position opened at Fort Sill in Lawton and he transferred to it.  11  His job was to oversee hiring and firing practices among minorities, not  just blacks but all minorities, on the post. He always said his job was  24/7 because employees thought nothing of coming to our house with  their problems. He was a father-confessor to those who were unhappily  employed.  My older son finished at the University of Oklahoma and received an  ROTC  Reserve Officers    Training Corps  commission the same day. He  served in the United States Army for seven years. While at Fort Bragg,  he completed a master   s degree in Community College Administration  at North Carolina State University. After receiving the doctorate, he was  chosen out of 180 applicants as president of Durham Technical  Community College. He served in that capacity for 27 years and when  he retired, they named a new building on campus for him  The Phail  Wynn Jr. Student Services Center . Recently he was hired as a vice-president  at Duke University.  My daughter, Patricia, passed away in 1983. She was a graduate of the  University of Oklahoma and she worked for Southwestern Bell.  My younger son, Michael David, lives here in Lewisville  Texas  and  works for Allstate. Both sons have wonderful wives. Both are the    wind  beneath my wings.    Phail and his wife have been married thirty-four  years. Mike hasn   t been married as long. I asked,    Mike, how long have  you and Cheryl been married?    He says,    I don   t know. She won   t tell  me.    (Laughter)  I have a grandson who is in Iraq now and it is breaking my heart. That   s  my oldest son   s only child. When he was in about the ninth grade he had  to do a paper on Macbeth. He was asking his father his opinion on  something about it and he said,    Why don   t you call your grandmother?  She teaches Shakespeare.    He called me and explained the project to me  and I said,    Now this ...    and when I was through with my long  explanation he said,    No Granny, it wasn   t like that. That scene, he did  this because of that and he did ...    Every thing, every observation he  made, he had a reason for making it. He is my pride and joy. And he   s  never been a child. He was born an adult. He and I have been having  conversations ever since he was about four or five years old and we talk  one adult to another.  My daughter was a person who never met a person she didn   t like or  didn   t like her. She didn   t meet strangers. She was one of the most  delightful people I   ve ever known, and she was my best friend. She died  when she was 29 and I   m always grateful that I was privileged to enjoy  her for 29 years.  12  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Let   s see now, I said I have the two best daughters-in-law in the world.  When I was inducted into the Hall of Fame, they came to take me to  Oklahoma City for the presentation. I made a little talk when I was  accepting and I the audience,    Now that couple there at the table, Dr.  and Mrs. Phail Wynn, Jr., they are the wind beneath my wings.    I feel  the same about Mike and Cheryl.  It sounds like family has been very important in your life through the  years  Oh yes. They really have.  We talked a little bit about your time in college as a student. Are there  any reflections or anything else you would like to mention about your  time either Langston or Oklahoma State that you would like to bring up  at this time?  Let   s see   Langston or Oklahoma State? Well, my time at Langston was  interesting. I was just there for two years. I finished in 1943, which  means I came to Langston in 1941. And you know what else happened  in that time? The war broke out and all the boys left the campus and  that   s when I learned to play bridge (Laughs). There was nothing else to  do. The war just completely devastated our campus.  No boys?  No boys.  Oh, that   s rough.  I loved college life and I loved living in the dorm. Being an only child  out on that farm and all of a sudden I have friends next door, across the  hall, down the hall. I was just surrounded. Oh, that was probably the  best atmosphere I could wish for. Dorm life was just wonderful.  And you lived on campus at Langston?  Yes.  Do you remember the name of your dorm?  Sanford Hall, named after one of the presidents, J.W. Sanford.  Langston   s campus is so different now than it was then. Back then they  didn   t have the wherewithal to bring it up to standard. The unique thing  about it was everybody that went to college went to Langston which  means you knew everybody because we were at Langston together. That  13  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  was the only college in Oklahoma that blacks could attend. That   s where  I met my husband, of course, at Langston.  Where did you meet him? Do you remember?  I met my husband at Langston just before World War II began. We met  in September and he went into the Air Force in November. We met in  the campus lounge one day after dinner. Most of my peers met their  husbands at Langston.  He didn   t go off to the war?  We   d been going together about three months when his time came up.  When he   d come home on furlough, instead of going home, he would  come to the campus to visit me.  What branch of the service was he in?  He was in the Air Force. One son was in the Army and the other was in  the Navy.  And your grandson?  My grandson is in the Marines. (Laughs) We touched all of them. It  wasn   t planned. It just happened that way.  Well, you   re a teacher, you   re an educator and you went to Langston  and you went to Oklahoma State for your master   s and PhD. Now,  sometimes we learn the background we need for our careers in different  places. Tell me about some of the most important places where you  learned the background for your career?  I started to teach in the middle of a semester and at Douglass they had  three classes   fourth, fifth and sixth   under two teachers. The teachers  had to travel from room to room and they were so glad to get me to  cover that extra room. (Laughs) I was just starting out. I owe much of  my success as a beginning teacher to one of my fourth grade students.  The very first week of school, we were in our devotional period when I  noticed that Marshall wasn   t singing. When we finished the song I asked  him why he didn   t sing. He said,    I just didn   t feel like singing this  morning.    Later when it was time to go home I dismissed the class one  by one. When there was nobody left but Marshall and me, he looked all  around with concern, and said,    Mrs. Wynn, may I go home now?    I  said,    No.    He sat there for a while and asked again. And again I said,     No.     14  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  The third time he said,    Are you going to let me go home?    I said,    Yes,  as soon as you sing all three verses of The Battle Hymn of the Republic  for me.    We were there until nearly six o   clock. Word must have gotten  around because I had no more discipline problems with the fourth grade.  I had a reputation as a disciplinarian at Douglass school and I learned  most of it from Marshall.  I also had one that said he didn   t have enough time off,    They ought to  give us more time off.    He said,    I could use another recess.    Well, we  used up that one recess so he said,    I think I need 30 minutes during the  day to do what I want to do.    So we got ready to go to lunch and I said,     Bobby Jo, bring your chair here.    We pushed his chair out in the hall. I  said,    We will be gone for 30 minutes, so that can be your 30 minutes  that you don   t have to be in the classroom.    He was out there by himself,  sitting in that chair for his 30 minutes. I never had any more problems  out of him. (Laughter)  Now that we are talking about your time as a teacher, an educator, can  you just run down the places where you taught for us?  Oh, that   s very easy. I only taught at Douglass, Lawton High and  Cameron University.  All right. And, how did you end up teaching in Oklahoma?  When I was a freshman or a sophomore in high school, the  superintendent came down one day and visited our class. He told the  teacher,    See that she finishes college. I   m going to hire her here at  Douglass.    But when I left college, I decided to do a brief stint in the  Pentagon. It seemed more exciting. After three months, I realized that I  did not belong in the Big City. So when they wired me that there was a  vacancy at Douglass, I left on the next train. (Laughs) The pace there  was too much; you ran everywhere. You slept in a hurry, you ate in a  hurry and you caught street cars in a hurry. I wanted out of that  congestion so I came back to nice, quiet Lawton. I said,    I   m Texas-born  and Okie-bred and when I die I   ll be Okie-dead.    I love Oklahoma.  I was away for a while because when my husband came out of the  service we moved away. He was of the opinion that neither of us had  enough education to compete favorably in the workforce. He said,    If I  move from my job or if anything happens to me, you may have to go to  work.    He said that a bachelor   s degree was not going to be enough to  qualify for a good job. I highly disagreed with him but he was right. His  brother had to push me up on the bus to go to Stillwater to start working  on the master   s. And incidentally we were strapped for cash so I had  only nine months to finish my master   s. When I came back (to Wichita  15  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Falls, Texas), I didn   t go to work. I was a stay-at-home mom for a while  and finally I came back to Lawton to teach. I drove back and forth on  weekends and in 1960, I came back to Lawton to live and went to work  at Douglass.  And how did you feel returning to teach at the place where you had  gone?  I was happy to return to Douglass as a faculty member. There   s nothing  like that first teaching experience when you see your name above the  door and you have made it. Douglass was always more to its alumni than  just a school or a job. It was a way of life. Our day at school didn   t end  at four o   clock when the bell rang. It ended only when we felt that we  had met the needs of each child for that day. The old African proverb,     It takes a village to raise a child,    certainly applied in this case. The  Douglass community was that village, and we knew. That   s why we go  back. Former students get together for a reunion every two years to share  that sense of belonging that we knew while there. To come back to  Douglass is to come    home.     When students came back to visit relatives in Lawton, they would come  to the school sometimes before they would go home to their friends and  neighbors. They knew they were well loved and they felt that love and  that sense of belonging. There was something about Douglass that made  you feel that you were home with family. We belonged and that sense of  belonging is what was necessary. We had an atmosphere I don   t think  can ever be duplicated.  Then came integration. About 1965 they closed Douglass. We lost the  village concept forever. The faculty was dispersed over the city. I was  not asked; I was told,    Next term, you will go to Lawton High.    Gene  Hancock was the principal at that time and he made my transition  exceptionally smooth. But it was a volatile situation.  Lawton High was not ready for integration, definitely not. The fortunate  thing was, and it always happens that way, I had the most remarkable  principal, Gene Hancock. My first semester there he would come down  every Friday and see how I was doing. After I moved to Cameron, he  told me some of the parents had called and wanted their kids moved out  of my class. He said,    Why don   t you let them stay in there for a while  and see if we can all make adjustments to one another.    He said most of  those parents were reasonable enough to come to him at the end of the  semester and say,    The best thing I ever did was keep my child in her  class.    So, I guess I had made it. (Laughs) I didn   t really have a  discipline problem because when I walked in the classroom, the students  would sit and stare. Most had never seen a black teacher up close before.  16  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  (Laughs)  And this was at Lawton High?  At Lawton High, yes. I still remember that year  1965  I spent there.  They needed a black at Lawton High.    There   s an opening in English     Val has a master   s in English, let   s send her up there, okay? All right?     Now how did you go from Douglass to Cameron University? If you  could just take us through that.  A friend of mine was playing golf with the president of Cameron on the  Lawton Golf Club and he paused in the middle of the game and said,     Look, Albert, we   re going to have to have a black at Cameron. Who  would you recommend?    He asked,    What department?       The English  department.    He said,    Ask Val Wynn. She   s got a master   s in English.        Have her come over and talk to me.     I began to feel like a checker on a board when I received the call to  come to Cameron University for an interview. I had taught at Cameron  for six months before I was given an application to complete.  Somewhere along the way it came to me that color outweighed  credentials in this rapidly changing environment. But I had always  wanted to teach in a university.  Cameron was in the process of becoming a four-year institution when I  joined the faculty. We were advised that we needed at least twenty-one  hours above the master degree to be qualified for further employment.  And so at forty-six years of age I found myself in the library at OSU  seeking more knowledge. The first time I went back in 1970, I got my  21 hours. I was through. (Laughs) I lost weight at OSU, studying so hard  but two things happened. First of all, it proved that I was not too old to  learn because the first test I had in the worst class there, the one that  everybody had warned me about, I made the highest grade. He  the  instructor  came over and stood before me and said,    Madam, you made  the highest grade in the class.    I didn   t know him well enough to tell him  what I wanted to tell him. It was hard to find a job in those years because  the profession was pretty crowded. Most were going all the way through  from bachelor   s to master   s to PhD. There were 16 of us in this  competitive class and making the highest grade in the class meant that I  had two or three sparks still burning.  Which class was that?  Something called    Introduction to Graduate Studies.    It was a fabled  class on the campus.  17  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  And how old were you when you went back for your PhD?  Forty-six. I somehow felt that it was all a dream from which I would  awaken and have a good laugh about the whole experience. But I have  yet to understand the reason I had to take a course entitled    Introduction  to Graduate Studies    when I already had a master   s degree from the  same institution. I worked harder for that class than for any class I have  ever taken. When I would complain, my husband would say,    Now, do  one thing. Evidently, this professor is the    bear.       Ace the bear    and  you   ve got it made.    So, I    aced    the bear. And I was home-free. An     A    in that class, I found, meant that no other professor dared give you  any less.  That   s good. Now you taught at Cameron University for how long?  19 years.  Would you just tell me a little about your experience at Cameron? Do  you have any fond memories you   d like to share with us?  I worked with some wonderful people. When I decided to move to  Lewisville  Texas , one of the retired faculty gave a dinner for me. She  was my department head for a while. To me that showed the kind of  atmosphere I had at Cameron. She thought that much of me. When we  had all this rain  in August 2007, Texas had a bad rainy spell  she called  to say,    Val, are you all right down there?    (Laughs)    Yes, I   m fine,    I  told her.  I made friends, and they were not just friends for the day while we were  at work, they were friends outside. I had friends at Cameron with whom  I shared materials and ideas. Many of them are still best friends of mine.  Loren McKeown was my department head and he was one of the very  best. I was given equal choice with all the others when it came to classes  and scheduling. I felt that I had found my niche. My experience at  Cameron fulfilled every dream I ever had of success in life. It was the  answer to my prayers   the fulfillment of my hopes and dreams.  I cherish the memories of many of my students. My scrapbooks are full  of memorabilia   letters, cards, gifts, etc., that I enjoy and that help me  to recall those happy times. I remember one summer class (in 1981), in  particular, that was the most highly motivated class I ever taught. I laid  out the plan for the summer, told them how we were going to reach our  objective and gave each student a syllabus. A relative died and my  daughter and I went to Los Angeles for the funeral. When I returned and  went to class the next day and the students came up and handed me two  tapes. They had met twice while I was gone and taped it all. They  18  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  literally    took the ball and ran with it.    That was the most remarkable  class I ever had.  One student told me later that he had never been in a class like that. He  said,    In that class, the teacher didn   t stand over me and demand this or  that. But I had to use everything I had and the atmosphere was a  creative, learning experience. It made learning really fun.    Another  student said,    You know what, I don   t mind going to class. But when  you have to run all the way across campus to get a good seat, now I  kinda mind that, especially in the summer time.    (Laughs)  What were some of the classes you taught at Cameron?  Everybody on the English faculty taught Freshman Composition. I  received the PhD in 1976, but when I returned to Cameron, I found  Freshman Composition waiting for me. When you go to graduate school,  you leave Freshman Composition. When you come back, it meets you at  the door. Don   t think just because you get a PhD, you won   t have to  teach Freshman Composition. It starts out as a fun course, but too many  students in each section, too many papers that have to be corrected line  by line, too many re-checks and revisions, eventually lead to teacher  burnout. The load leaves little or no time for student conferences, for  development of creative teaching strategies and even for family time. I  think that   s the reason I retired. I got up one morning to go to school and  I said to myself,    I just don   t think I can do this another year.     I had an article about an English teacher at one of the other major  universities who just drove his car in the lake one day. It   s the teaching  load in Freshman Composition that makes it such a task. You have too  many students and there are a certain basic requirements that you lay out  for them that must be completed. Students are required to write seven  papers and each must be corrected, revised and discussed with each  student in order for them to progress to the next step. This paper tornado  begins in September. You get a brief rest and it starts again in January.  For Christmas they let you catch your breath for a while and then you  plunge right back into it.  We had different things we carried our papers in because we were  ashamed to let the other disciplines know just how much paperwork we  had to do. We talked about doing it on campus, but that was a challenge  because we had to keep an open door for the students. You want to talk  to the students when they come in. In order to grade a composition you  have to concentrate.  Did you have to teach any literature classes?  19  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Happily, the second semester we teach Introduction to Literature and  later, upper division classes were added. I taught Shakespeare, World  Literature, and the Victorian Age. We were allowed to choose the  courses that we were to teach. They   re very democratic about it at  Cameron. They send around a list of what   s to be taught and let you  select your preferences.  Oh, wow.  You can   t beat that. Oh it was a liberating experience at Cameron.  I read somewhere about the pageant  at Cameron University . Tell me  about the pageant.  Black students organized the Ebony Society. I was co-sponsor. A  student named Leon Yates suggested that we have a Miss Black CU  pageant. We felt we needed an activity that would be a showcase for the  beauty and talents of young black girls on campus. Initially, we faced a  lack of interest on the part of the students, the administration and the  community as a whole. Cameron is a unique experience because most of  the students live off-campus. They don   t have that same desire for  involvement because they go on to jobs or other things. We decided to  try it anyway. We reached out to organizations in the community asking  them to sponsor each of the contestants. This meant they had an interest  in somebody on that stage and thus all the members of that group would  probably be there. This plan worked and our first pageant in 1980  opened with 13 contestants to a standing-room-only crowd. I have a  picture of the first pageant against the wall over there  in Wynn   s living  room .  The pageant has become the signal activity of Black History month and  was renamed  in 1985  in my honor in appreciation of my contributions  as sponsor and director. They have one every year and they send me  pictures. There   s a feeling of accomplishment among the girls. They say,     Well, I   m Miss Black CU    or,    I was Miss Black CU in 1976.    We  were pleased to discover so much talent. Some of the most exciting  talent has come from St. Kitts and St. Lucia and the girls are so pleasant  to work with.  I have found foreign students to be the source of so much pleasure. I can  truthfully say that I have never taught a dumb Indian. I have never  taught a dumb African. The ones that come from all over the world have  different learning attitudes, behavior patterns and value systems.  One Japanese student was walking five miles each from Fort Sill to  Cameron. So I arranged with the multicultural person to find him a ride.  20  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  I hesitated to call on him in class because I couldn   t pronounce his name  so one day I kept him after class and asked him to help me with his  name. We went to my office and we worked for about half an hour.  Finally, I had it almost perfectly. He started out and at the door he turned  and said to me in perfect English,    But you can call me Tony      Unfortunately he had to return to Japan before the year ended, but I will  never forget him.  One African student never missed a question on a quiz or in a class  discussion. One day I chatted with him briefly and discovered that he  had studied all the material we were covering, but America would not  honor his transcript. As a result, he was having to repeat all the courses  he had already had. He carried away a load of books and he told me how  much they would be appreciated back in his homeland. I didn   t think I  had done anything special. I just thought I could do something for  someone who had such a keen desire to learn. When you see that, you  cherish it. It becomes the most precious thing in the world, when you  can find a student who really desires to learn.  Did you find that your students inspired you through the years?  Well     Sometimes?  There was a mature Indian lady who returned to resume her interrupted  studies. She wanted a good foundation so that she could return to the  reservation and teach her people. The class activity was    the Peter  Principle.    The Peter Principle holds that in a hierarchy, you will be  prepared at the entry level but you   ll get promoted till you reach a level  of incompetence. Each student was given a list of five statements which,  when discussed, would result in a yes or no decision on the part of each  student. The sheets were numbered one through five, resulting in five  students in each group. The groups selected a leader who was to report  their decisions to the class at the end of the activity. Each student in each  group had a vote. Her group reported on each question with a four to one  vote.    Who was that one?    I asked.    I was the one,    she said.    I didn   t  agree with them on anything.    It turned out that she was the only female  in her group. I think she was marked for success.  We   ve talked about this a little bit today. Tell me about any stumbling  blocks or adversity you have faced along the way in your line of work.  Well, I don   t think I should get off into that anymore because it has to do  with segregation and working in a segregated atmosphere. Also, the fact  that my father and mother were divorced and the fact that my husband  21  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  passed away in the middle of my doctorate. Those would be stumbling  blocks, major stumbling blocks.  But, I cannot forget having to pass a high school to go to high school  because I was black. That is the unpleasant side of it. Let sleeping dogs  lie. It   s not that way anymore, so let   s move on.  Okay. Can you go into detail about one key moment in your career that  you consider one of your biggest highlights?  Being recognized for achievement, being able to stick it out, being able  to compete in the white dominated world. Every day was a challenge for  the first two or three years after I was moved out of my comfort zone  and finally seeing stumbling blocks become stepping-stones. The  adjustment was made and I learned not to nurse grudges. Somebody  asked me one time, didn   t I hate after you know    I said,    I can   t afford  the luxury of hate. I don   t have the time to hate people and furthermore,  here is John Doe. He   s white but he   s not the one that denied me an  opportunity. So why should I punish him for something that somebody  else did to me.    That was one of the mistakes we started out making. It  helped to know that my family cheered me on and believed in me.  When you were notified that you were going to be inducted into the  Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame, what were your thoughts?  The first thought that came into my mind was I wish my mother were  here. I would like her to know that I made it on the foundation she laid. I  would like my husband to know that I completed the terminal degree  and that I was able to hold the family together after he went away. It was  my responsibility to pass on the Wynn name and to see that it meant  something to our children. My father-in-law was delighted when Phail,  Junior was born. He said,    The Wynn name will not die.    Pride in  lineage was something that he knew, my husband knew and our sons  know. We wanted them to feel that to be a Wynn was to be special. It  made you work a little harder, made you dream bigger dreams. That   s  why I   m so pleased with this experience, so that my family will know  that what we achieve in our lifetime will be passed on. We both came  from large families but our families have dwindled down to a few but as  long as my sons and grandson are in this world, I   ll know that there will  be pride in whatever we do.  Do you remember the ceremony back in    96 back when you were  inducted? Do you remember who was there from your family?  At the Hall of Fame?  22  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Yes.  We had a Lawton table and most of the people at the table were from  Lawton. The reason I remember it so well Rahsaan, my grandson who is  now in Iraq, flew in and forgot his shoes. Stores were closed when we  realized this. So we had to borrow a pair from a friend.  Our responses on being presented were supposed to be two minutes but  one lady went on for about 20 minutes. But out of all of this, what I  remember was she was in her late 80s and was still taking piano lessons  and that meant a great deal to me. That spark never dies. She was a  concert pianist but she still believed that there was more she could learn,  that she could still enhance her skills. Doesn   t that give you an  optimistic feeling about life?  Makes you feel pretty good.  Yes.  That you could always do something.  Right and more of something    that there   s always more to learn.  You   ve touched many, many students over the years. How do you feel  that now people look to you as a role model?  Well, it   s what I   ve always hoped for, that I   ve cut a path through the  wilderness that others could follow. I hope that I have created within  some students a desire to be just more than a student, but to be a scholar.  And to be a Douglass graduate also means something special.  Can you tell me a little something about the people you would like to  thank that have played an important role in your life?  I think I   ve touched on most of them, beginning with Reba Chaney. But  now one of my main sources of pride and accomplishment is my son.  We live vicariously through our children and he never lets me forget for  a single moment that I have inspired him to learn. I remember when he  introduced me at Durham Tech one time. He said,    I am but a clone, this  is the real Wynn over here.    I enjoyed that the rest of the day.  My children tell me that I suffer from an inferiority complex because I  am still climbing. I am that way about my religion. They say,    You   re a  Christian.    I say,    I think I   m a work in progress.    I can   t stop anywhere  and rest on my laurels. There is more to do, more to do.  23  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  We had an after-school program at our church for at-risk children. There  was one little first grade girl in my class who taught me a lesson. She  came to my desk with the lesson she was working on and asked for help.  I explained it to her and she went back to her seat and soon came back  with the work all finished. I said,    Oh, how nice. We will put one of  these achievement stickers on it.       Oh no,    she said.    Why not?    I  asked.    Because you helped me,    she answered.    When I have one that I  have done all by myself, then we will put a sticker on it.    Whenever I  think of any achievement of mine, I think of that little girl and I ask  myself,    Did I do it all by myself?     The main thing I believe in life is the part the All Mighty plays in our  lives. I have been guided by All Mighty God whose presence and power  I have felt every step along the way. It has been such a comfort to know  that I was never alone. I had not thought of coming to Lewisville      Texas     Lewisville? Where is Lewisville? Whoever heard of  Lewisville?    I was on my way to bible study and a thought just hit me,  just like a bolt out of the blue,    Move to Lewisville with Mike.    I said,     Move to Texas?    I said to myself,    Move to Texas with Mike?     Anyway, I put my house on the market and it sold the first week to Mrs.  Michael Wynn. You know how you do some things and everything falls  into place. You try that again and everything goes wrong. Well, I tell  you   Some things are meant to be.  Yes, sir. All of the billion people on this planet     And a Wynn bought your house.  W-Y-N-N. And it was the right decision. I am happy here and I feel like  everything worked out for the best when I decided to let go and let God  take over.  Well if you could give any advice to fellow Oklahomans, what would you  tell them?  Find a job that you love. Put your heart and soul into it. Strive constantly  to do your very best. Never settle for second best, not even from yourself  because a mind is a terrible thing to waste.  You know, so many people just coast by doing the minimum. You owe  the world more than that. You owe a fee just for taking up space,  because that   s all that some of us are doing. In Thornton Wilder   s play  Our Town Emily, one of the characters, had died but she wanted to come  back to life. She was granted this privilege and she chose a certain day to  24  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  return. However, she did not stay the entire day, because she said,     People here are not living; they are just existing.    It   s true. So many  waste this precious commodity called life by not living, just existing.  What would be your advice to women that plan to follow in your  footsteps?  That was it.  Okay.  I like the commercials on television that tell you if you   re in a dead end  job, go out and find something that stirs you so that you   ll be eager to go  to work and carry that over to your working environment. A bored  teacher will have a class of bored pupils but if you keep that  enthusiasm   enthusiasm comes from a word meaning    fire of the  Gods      stir up that fire and transmit it. See that you are getting it across  so that the students will want to learn and you won   t have discipline  problems. It will just be a meaningful experience for you and the  children.  And finally today, when history is written about you, what would you  like it to say?  I would like history to say that I have learned as much as I have taught. I  hope that I have cut a path through the wilderness of life that others may  follow. Maybe I have created within some students the desire to be more  than just a student   to be a scholar.  Well, is there anything else you   d like to mention today that we have not  touched upon?  Early in my retirement, Governor George Nigh appointed me to the  Board of Regents of Oklahoma Colleges. We monitored the affairs of  six Oklahoma universities, meeting once each month for eleven months  of the year. I served in this capacity for seven years, one of which I  served as president. I was (again) the first black  I spent the first year  observing, studying the manual, and getting to know each regent. When  I did begin to speak out (the second year), I got that old    I didn   t know  you were that intelligent    look. However, at the end of my seven-year  term, the presidents presented me with a plaque for exemplary service. I  introduced diversity to the Board. Ask any of them about the Michigan  Mandate.  Now, I think we   ve just about covered it. (Laughs) It has been delightful,  though. I have enjoyed going back into some of these experiences that I  25  Nykolaiszyn  Wynn  don   t think about everyday. I will look back on this and enjoy it.  Well we do appreciate your time in helping us to preserve your story.  It was my pleasure, it was my pleasure.  -------  -------
