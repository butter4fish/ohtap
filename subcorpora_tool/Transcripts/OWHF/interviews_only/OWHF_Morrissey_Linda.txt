 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Friday, May 15, 2009. I   m in Tulsa, Oklahoma  interviewing Judge Linda Morrissey. This interview is being conducted  as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame   Project . Linda Morrissey was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s  Hall of Fame in 2003. Thank you for joining us today.  It   s really an honor that you would be interested enough to gather all of  this information, so thank you for being here.  Well, thank you. We   d like to begin by learning a little bit more about  you, if you could talk about where you grew up and your early life.  Okay. I was born in Washington, D.C. with a twin sister, Laurie. We  came to Wagoner County to a farm when I was about a year old, I guess,  and I lived there until I started first grade. In fact, we did not go to  kindergarten, my twin sister and I. We just went straight to first grade,  and then we had to move into town, the nearby town, which was  Haskell. Thereafter, we moved to Tulsa and we continued to spend a  great deal of time on the farm with our grandmother, but we went to  school in Tulsa where our parents lived. We stayed in Tulsa until we  completed high school and then  went  on to college.  Wow. So, did you have lots of chores on the farm growing up?  Yes, although  it was  not a typical working farm. That era for the farm  had sort of passed at that point, and there were tenant farmers who grew  things like soy beans and wheat on the land, but we didn   t have cattle or  chickens after I got older. Now, when I was young, we did have  chickens and we were right out there with our grandmother collecting  eggs and feeding the chickens and so on, a real kind of story book farm  experience. And we also had a huge vegetable garden that we tended and  collected the vegetables from in the spring and summer. So, to that  5  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  extent, it was like a traditional farm, but it wasn   t a working farm in that  we relied on the money from the farm to support ourselves.  And were your schools when you were younger very big or small? I  would assume in Tulsa they were bigger.  They were bigger in Tulsa. In Haskell, when we went to first grade in  Haskell, I think there were maybe twenty-five or thirty children in our  first grade class. When we came to Tulsa, we were at a much larger  school where there was more than one section of second grade at that  point and therefore a lot more children. It was definitely an urban  school. It was in downtown Tulsa in a very urban environment. The  playground was asphalt, as a matter of fact, and it was very difficult for  us to adjust to moving to a city school after having gone to this small  school in a small rural community where we started first grade. So, I  think we managed to survive, but we always returned to the farm as soon  as we could, every Friday, and we would stay until Sunday night and we  spent all of our summers on the farm. So, the farm continued to be our  anchor. It was an idyllic kind of existence down there. For example, the  farm has a rock house on it surrounded by a white fence, a white wooden  fence. Across the front of that native rock house, there is a screen porch  that spans the width of the house. We had three iron bed frames on the  front porch, and we slept out there on that front porch with our  grandmother listening to the night sounds, and there was a pond just  very close so we could hear the frogs and it was just idyllic. Beautiful,  beautiful, beautiful setting.  So, what did you like to do for fun growing up?  Well, I loved horses. I had a horse named Princess, so I spent a lot of  time on those country roads around the farm riding my horse Princess  with some of the other young kids who lived in neighboring farms. We  would ride, in fact, down this dirt road over to Stone Bluff. You may  have heard of Stone Bluff. There are several businesses in Stone Bluff  now, so it   s reasonably well-known, at least in this part of Oklahoma.  Back then it was just a tiny little grocery store, you know, spot on the  road. We would go on these adventures, riding to Stone Bluff on those  country roads, and it would be a daylong adventure to get there and then  return to the farm all grimy and dusty and tired and blissfully happy after  having gone on this great adventure. So, that   s what we spent a lot of our  summer days doing: riding horses around the country.  So, back in school, what were your favorite subjects?  I loved math. I loved math, and I guess I must have had some aptitude in  it because, you know, one tends to like those subjects that one excels in.  6  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  So, I enjoyed history in addition to math. I loved geometry, for example,  another math subject. I loved English, like diagramming sentences. Back  in the day, we diagrammed sentences to learn the parts of the sentence  and the sentence structure. It was more like a game to me, so I guess  those would be the subjects that I enjoyed the most.  So, growing up, what did you aspire to be? What did you think would be  a great thing to become?  You know, my mother was a teacher and she taught in a neighboring  community, Coweta. So, of course, I guess I grew up anticipating that I  would be a teacher and, in fact, my twin sister did as well. We both got  teaching degrees. We then continued and each got counseling degrees,  anticipating that we would spend our professional careers in the public  school setting. But while I was at OSU actually getting my master   s  degree, I had the opportunity to serve on the Academic Appeals Board,  and I found the process fascinating of people submitting information and  advocating, students that is, advocating and adjudicating and making  decisions about whether or not a grade would be changed or the  applicant would receive some relief from the Academic Appeals Board.  That really triggered my interest in law and advocacy. So, that spring, I  took the LSAT and then applied to law school at OU. So, that really was  the point at which I kind of veered off course and jumped track from  pursuing a career in teaching to pursuing a career in the law.  So, in talking with lawyers and judges, everybody has a different  perception of law school.  Yes.  How was law school for you?  Law school was very difficult for me, although in a good way because it  was very academically challenging and, as is true for most law students,  I came into that, I came to that experience having pretty comfortably  made very good grades all through school and was really stunned when I  didn   t make what I expected my first semester of law school. I mean, I  did okay, but it wasn   t straight As, which was a real shock to my system.  And a lot of law students experience that kind of disappointment after  having experienced the ability to earn As in all their classes theretofore.  So, it was tough but it was challenging, and it was just very rewarding to  immerse myself in a different discipline and learn the various bodies of  law that law students are schooled in.  So, after law school, lots of jobs, everybody   s knocking down your door?  7  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  (Laughs) I graduated from law school in 1980, and at that time the oil  business was still booming, but the opportunity for one to work in law  firms, for example, was not as great as we all hoped. I did go to work for  a law firm as soon as I graduated from law school for a short while, and  I was delighted to have been offered a job. So, I was thrilled to have a  job. Some of my classmates would laughingly describe papering their  bathroom wall with rejection letters, and I got my fair share of those too,  believe me. But I was fortunate enough to get a job, and then I had  another opportunity to move to an oil company called City Service. And  I guess it would have been the very end of    80 or the first part of 1981, I  went to work for City Service Oil Company, and I found that  fascinating. And, again, that event in my life directed the course of the  next phase of my life when I spent my years as an oil and gas lawyer,  primarily, real estate and oil and gas.  And you did that for how long?  Let   s see. I guess I was an oil and gas lawyer and a real estate lawyer for  about a decade. And incidentally during that decade, the oil industry sort  of cratered and we all scraped to survive, and we did, but as we got  toward the end of the    80s, it really became hopeless. The oil industry     well, I guess a barrel of oil went down to, I think, below  10 a barrel at  one point, and now people are complaining that it   s down. It   s in the  50  a barrel range after having gone up to almost  150 a barrel. So, the oil  companies could no longer search for and produce oil. It just wasn   t  economically viable. And I then had the opportunity to go to work for  the Resolution Trust Corporation and it was a   you know, they say  history repeats itself. Well, back then in the early    90s, our economy, in  particular the banking industry, was going through the same sort of  turmoil and adjustments that we are now, and banks were failing at  record rates. So, the Resolution Trust Corporation was created by the  federal government to identify banks that were unstable and then either  support those banks in becoming stable or take the banks down   that  was our terminology   and then sell off the assets or perhaps sell the  bank to other people in the banking industry.  So, I spent about a year doing that at the Resolution Trust Corporation.  Then, as luck would have it, they decided to close their Tulsa office, so I  had an opportunity to go to work at the Court of Civil Appeals here in  Tulsa for Justice  Paul  Boudreaux. At the time, he was a judge on the  Court of Civil Appeals. He ultimately went on to the Supreme Court, but  I had the opportunity to work for Judge Boudreaux as a staff attorney at  the Court of Civil Appeals for three years. And again, another  fascinating experience, which allowed me to look at the law from the  perspective of the 360-degree analysis. That is, we at that point would  look at the cases that had gone through the district court system. In many  8  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  instances, there had been an adjudication as the result of a jury trial, and  then one party or the other would appeal the decision of the jury or the  decision of the court, perhaps, and those appeals then would be  considered by the staff attorneys for these appellate judges. So, I got to  sit, sort of, in an ivory tower and conduct research and write  memorandum opinions and study these cases with a lot of detail and  consideration that is only possible at that appellate level when you have  the luxury of that kind of time.  Now that I   m in the district court level, which is back a stage, I realize  that the district court judges just don   t have that luxury of being able to  pore over these decisions in that kind of a sterile sort of atmosphere,  where we can look at all the potential cases and issues and rulings and  interpretations of the cases and so on. So, after I was at the Court of  Civil Appeals for three years, I applied for a position here in the district  court as a special judge. The special judges are sort of the entry-level  judges on the district level, and the special judges typically preside over  things like family dockets, domestic violence dockets, preliminary  criminal procedures, like preliminary hearings and so on, small claims,  that sort of thing. So, I applied for a job as a special judge and was very  fortunate to be selected as a special judge in 1995, and I   ve been on the  bench ever since. I did ultimately run for and become a district judge,  but I   ve been on the bench since 1995, and it   s just been a great  experience, tremendously rewarding, just an experience that I can   t think  of a situation that would have been more gratifying and satisfying than  the job I   ve had since 1995.  At what point did you say,    I think I want to be a judge?     Good question. And that certainly would have been while I was at the  Court of Civil Appeals looking at the work of other judges and lawyers  and putting myself in the position of those judges and lawyers. And, you  know, you   d find yourself reading transcripts and thinking,    Why didn   t  the judge do this?    or,    Why did the judge do that?    and,    I could do  that,    and just, I guess, the ability to look at it at that stage, to sort of  look back like you   re reading a history book of what had transpired to  bring the case to that point at the appellate level. I was able to  experience vicariously what the judge and lawyers did at the trial court  level, and I became confident that I could do that. Although, when I had  first become licensed back in 1980, I was terrified of the court,  absolutely terrified of this courthouse, terrified of going into a  courtroom, and I avoided it. As I told you, I was an oil and gas lawyer  and a real estate lawyer, which meant I never had to go to court. I never  had to advocate in open court.  One time, I recall, I was doing a little bit of probate and I was supposed  9  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  to get a will admitted to probate, (Laughs) which is about the easiest,  most non-threatening procedure one can do as a lawyer in a courtroom.  But I sat there in the courtroom watching the other cases on the docket  and watching the lawyers stand up and go through this little, very simple  process of getting a will admitted into probate, and I just became more  and more anxious. And I finally decided,    I can   t do this. I   m going to  make a fool of myself. I cannot do this.    And so I got up, I left the  courtroom, I tracked my husband down who is a lawyer and I begged  him. I said,    Please.    He happened to be here in the courthouse because  he is a litigator and was at the time, and I begged him to come back to  the courtroom where my case was pending and get this will admitted  into probate. Well, he had been down here for some matter that didn   t  require a formal appearance, with something that would occur in  chambers, for example, where we are right now. So, he didn   t have a  coat and tie on. He just had slacks and a shirt on, but I guess for the sake  of marital harmony, he agreed to do it. (Laughter)  So, he came to the courtroom and, when the case was called, he stepped  up and went through the process of getting this will admitted to probate,  which it   s truly the simplest thing one can do, I think, in the practice of  law in a courtroom. And when it was over, it just takes about five  minutes, the judge said,    Mr. Nicks, approach the bench.    So my  husband walked up to the bench and the judge said,    Mr. Nicks, we have  a requirement here in this courthouse that lawyers wear coats and ties if  they   re going to appear in open court. Don   t let that happen again.     (Laughs) Well, poor John, he was considerate enough not to expose me  for having gotten him into the predicament in the first place. But,  anyway, that was my one foray into trial work back in the early 1980s.  And it   s interesting, Juliana, that now, fast forward 29 years later, I spent  years in the probate court as the presiding judge of the probate docket  and have gone through as a judge a hundred different procedures where  we admit wills to probate. So, I think it   s kind of a testament about how  we limit ourselves by our own fears and lack of confidence and, really, a  lack of a willingness to just forge ahead. You know, I now call it just  pushing through the fog and trying something that   s outside our comfort  zone, and giving ourselves the gift of being able to achieve something  that is outside our comfort zone. Usually we can achieve it; we just limit  ourselves. So, that   s a little illustration of, I think, that adage that we can  accomplish more than we believe we can if we will just believe in  ourselves and allow ourselves to try.  Well, now that we   re talking about your time on the bench, I   d like to  talk a little bit about Drug Court.  Okay.  10  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Tell me about Drug Court.  Oh, I love Drug Court. (Laughs) One of my passions, I guess, as a judge,  in 1997, I had the good fortune of being assigned to preside over this  new concept called Drug Court. Now, there had been a judge on the  docket for a year before me, I believe, and he was reassigned to another  docket. I was the special judge at the time, and the presiding judge  assigned me to the Drug Court docket. Until that point, I had never been  exposed to criminal law, to any type of criminal law, certainly not to  drug-related cases. But, I did have this kind of social work attitude and  mentality about the kind of work I was doing at the time in Family  Court, and I did have a counseling degree, and so these Drug Court cases  were the types of cases that were not punitive. They were not designed  to be punitive. Rather, they were designed to support and educate and  encourage and nurture people who were charged with nonviolent drug-related  offenses, to help them become clean and sober, and help them to  commit to a life of sobriety.  So, I had the good fortune of being assigned this Drug Court docket and  I just saw so much potential, so much potential with the people that I  worked with who were assigned to Drug Court. They were all charged  with felonies that were drug related, like possession of a controlled drug.  Sometimes it was just some sort of theft-related crime or knowingly  concealing stolen property, but the underlying cause of their criminal  activity was a drug addiction. So, they could opt into this Drug Court  program that   s non-punitive and the procedure allowed these  participants in the Drug Court program to say,    Hey, I have a drug  problem. I want to deal with my drug problem, I just need some help.  Will you help me?    And they had to agree to be very committed to the  process, which was a process requiring a lot of time and effort on their  part to attend twelve-step programs, to go to treatment, sometimes in-patient,  sometimes out-patient, to appear in court, to become gainfully  employed and so on, and subject themselves to a great deal of  supervision. We had officers who went out to their homes who would  just do random visits to their homes and so on. So, there was a lot of  accountability to the court, and that really enabled those that wanted to  take advantage of the program   most of them did and most of them  were successful   to experience eighteen months to twenty-four months  in this controlled environment where they were committed to a sober  lifestyle. Then, at the end of that procedure, they had relearned some life  skills. They had learned how to get through days without resorting to  using drugs. They had learned about the consequences of using drugs.  They had learned about the effects of their drug usage on their loved  ones.  I   ll never forget one young man who came in one morning in May after  11  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Mother   s Day, the Sunday before, and when we drug tested him, he was  hot. He had used drugs over the weekend, and I began to inquire of him,     How did that happen? What happened?    He said that he and his mother  had celebrated Mother   s Day by sharing marijuana, a marijuana  cigarette. I mean, that was just his life experiences to that point. That   s  what had been modeled for him by his, at least, his mom. That   s what he  saw as just a normal, ordinary thing to do. Although, at that point, he  knew he shouldn   t, he still didn   t have the internal fortitude to decline to  use drugs when offered. That young man ultimately graduated from the  program and what I believe, Juliana, is that he then went on to model  drug-free behaviors to his own family, to his own children, and to those  people whose lives he influences.  That is the beauty of Drug Court. It is an intervention that allows people  to change not only their own lives and to become productive members of  society, it reduces the propensity to re-offend and re-enter the criminal  justice system, which counterparts  those  who don   t go through the  Drug Court program do at a rate of like 60 percent. It   s called  recidivism. And, you know, 60 percent of those people will come back  into the criminal justice system after they   ve been charged with a drug-related  crime, predictably. The Drug Court participants, in contrast,  don   t, typically. It   s unusual for Drug Court participants to re-offend  once they get clean and sober and establish a life of sobriety, and so they  model that behavior to the next generation. It   s just a great intervention,  and it   s a way to change the way society at large and the criminal justice  system, in particular, manages these drug offenders.  I like how you also used it as an outreach, a learning program.  I did. I did because, as I said, I saw it as a real opportunity to affect those  people that were not in Drug Court, the family members and so on, but I  also saw it as an opportunity to try to influence and impact young people  who were at that stage in their life where they would very likely be  placed in the position of choosing whether or not to use drugs. And I  wanted those young people to know the other side of the story, the  consequences of what happens to a person who chooses to use drugs. So,  I contacted local school districts and I just took the show on the road. I  literally packed up Drug Court and I went out to schools around the  greater Tulsa area, and we had Drug Court in the schools. We would  have our participants give, sort of, testimonials to the student body and  talk about how they originally came to use drugs and the effect that it   d  had on their life, how improved their life was as a result of choosing to  be clean and sober. We showed the students pictures of these people  when they would come into the program which, you know, typically we  always did take pictures of them, and typically they would be very  disheveled, emaciated, hollow-eyed, just someone who was not in good  12  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  shape at all, and you could tell that just by looking at them, just looking  at their physique and their face and so on. And then, we would show not  only a picture, but in many instances a real live version of this person,  eighteen or twenty-four months later where they   re clear-eyed and they  look healthy and they   re vibrant and they   re enthusiastic about life. So,  of course, the message to these students was,    When I am offered the  opportunity to use drugs, I   m going to decide not to because I know  what   s going to happen to me if I make the wrong decision to use  drugs.    And I hope that it did have that impact. I certainly got a lot of  really good feedback for those programs that we took to these school  systems around the Tulsa area.  Now, you also heard a lot of cases regarding domestic violence.  Yes, I did. And that is an area of law that is a real concern for me, not  because I   ve ever been a victim of domestic violence, because I have  not. But some of my loved ones have, and I also have observed how  debilitating, emotionally and physically and financially, domestic  violence can be. So, when I first became a special judge and I was asked  what I would like to do, I said,    I would like to preside over a domestic  violence docket.    And one of my colleagues said,    If you keep telling  people that, they   re going to think you   ve got a loose screw. They   re  going to think something   s wrong with you, you   re not stable.    And I  said,    I do, though. I think I can make a difference. I have a passion for  those areas, and I would like to preside over a domestic violence  docket.    So, they let me.  We set up a standalone, single-issue docket, which was the domestic  violence docket, and that   s all I did for at least a year, maybe longer than  that. All I did was deal with domestic violence cases. I don   t think I have  a loose screw, and I found it to be very rewarding and I think we did  accomplish a lot by managing those cases and those families in a  proactive way so that we could protect, we could educate, we could  empower, and hopefully change the course of lives. And I want to say  that not only did we work with the victims of domestic violence, we also  took it a step further and worked with the perpetrators of domestic  violence to educate them about the consequences of their decision and  educate them about other coping skills and decision making and so on,  so that they, hopefully, in the future would make other decisions about  the way they attempted to control another person   s life. I mean,  hopefully, they   re not going to use violence or force to control another  person as a result of the education they   ve learned, or at least that was  our ambition. And they told us that it did make a difference for them, so  I hope it did.  And then continuing on, divorce and child custody.  13  Morrissey  Yes, yes. After I left the domestic violence docket, I was assigned to a  family court docket, and I like to call it a family court docket because  it   s a process that is typically a divorce case, but it truly involves the  whole family. And I   m not just talking about the family unit that is  going through a divorce. I   m talking about related family members and  even friends, to some extent. But I believed that the process was very  destructive and it was unnecessarily destructive and it exacerbated the  conflict within family units, I believed. So, I had the opportunity to work  with four other women, and some of those women are in the Hall of  Fame, like Norma Eagleton, I believe. We worked for, literally, years in  a little group. We   d meet like once a week, maybe once a month, during  some phases and we cobbled together, by looking at systems all around  the United States, a plan for supporting families as they were going  through these very, very difficult proceedings or life experiences where  the mother and father within the family unit were choosing not to  maintain their relationship. Usually it was husbands and wives, but not  always. Sometimes it   s just a   you know, there were paternity cases  where the parties weren   t married, but they had children.  So, anyway, we put together a thorough program for supporting these  families as they were going through this process. I remember one day we  were sitting up in the office of Judge  Deborah  Shallcross. She was one  of the women who worked with us, and we were trying to decide what  we were going to call this program that we had put together. And I said,     Well, I think what we   re doing is we are supporting families as they  transition from one family unit to two family units, maybe more than  two family units. But, basically, they   re going through a transition, and I  think we should call this program Families in Transition because that   s  what   s happening. They are going through a transition and if we can,  from the very beginning, introduce them to the concept of Families in  Transition, provide them with the skills and the knowledge and the  understanding and the wisdom to know how to go through this transition  in a positive way, in a way that will minimize the adverse effect to the  children and the parties. What a gift we   ll give our community.     I also believed that the cost of the litigation model was very debilitating  to families financially. They were already compromised and crippled,  usually, when they got to the divorce court, which I called family court.  Once they finished, my goodness, they were really crippled financially  in most cases. This Families in Transition program created an alternative  and allowed the families to manage the way they would transition into  two family units with the support of experts and professionals that  weren   t the adversary-type professional, like a lawyer. I mean, usually  they would use lawyers, but we also wanted them to bring into the mix  counselors, family therapists, and sometimes parenting coordinators to  teach Mom and Dad how to work with their children and preserve  14  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  relationships and so on. So, we believed that we could support these  families as they went through this transition in a way that would help  them to work through it so that they would leave the process with a  healthier frame of mind, and the children would not experience the  really debilitating effects that divorce typically has on children.  I feel great pride, I guess, that one thing I have accomplished so far in  my judicial career is being a part of bringing the Families in Transition  program to Tulsa County, and it was unique to Oklahoma. There was not  another Families in Transition program or a program like that in the state  of Oklahoma when we implemented this in 1998. And, as luck would  have it, I was elected to a district judgeship in 1998. So, I became Chief  of the Family Division in 1998 and that was when we actually  implemented the Families in Transition program and provided all the  forms which we had created and so on. Now, this small group of women  that originally crafted the concept and brought the components of the  program together took the program that we had put together to a much  larger committee of lawyers and other judges and consumers and so on,  and mental health professionals, and they put their spin on it. So,  ultimately, we came out with a document that is the Families in  Transition program that provides all the steps in the process that families  go through when they are deciding not to continue as a single family  unit.  And I   m sure you   ve heard a lot of good stories emerging from that, just  like Drug Court.  Yes, yes. I had a mom tell me one time outside the courthouse, you  know, just out in some social situation, that she had been in a divorce  case. This is before Families in Transition. She had been in a divorce  case, and she said,    I sat in the back of the courtroom, and up at the  bench where the judge sat was my lawyer and my soon to be ex-husband   s  lawyer, and the three of them stood up there and, in hushed  tones, they talked about our children, our home, our assets, our  relationship, our finances, and we weren   t a part of it. We were sitting in  the back of the courtroom.    That is the litigation model. It   s the lawyers  and the judge making decisions about these families that will affect them  for the rest of their lives, make no mistake about it, for the rest of their  lives. And she said she felt disenfranchised. She wasn   t a part of this  process, and yet it was having this dramatic direct effect on her.  The Families in Transition model is just the opposite. The parties whose  lives are affected by the fragmentation of the family are the drivers.  They are the ones that are making decisions. They are an integral part of  the whole decision-making process, where the child will go to school,  where the child will live primarily, and so on. A very different approach  15  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  that I think is much healthier. It   s much less expensive; it doesn   t  engender the kind of conflict, and sometimes hatred, that the litigation  model does. It doesn   t force parents to get up on the witness stand and,  as they say,    air their dirty laundry    and tell things that were never  intended to be heard by people outside the privacy of their own home.  So, I just think it   s a much healthier and more effective process for our  families in this community.  So, after Family Court and Drug Court, what was next?  Well, another thing I got to implement when I was Chief of Family that,  again, I take great pride in and has been tremendously gratifying over  my career is another standalone, specialized docket, and this was called  the Child Support Enforcement docket. I smile because I think that  docket, perhaps, has done as much good for moms and dads in this  community as any other docket. It   s still viable. I mean, it   s   there is  still a Child Support Enforcement docket. And the way I came to create  this docket and craft this system was when I was on the domestic  violence docket, I noticed that very often the issue of child support was  one of the primary igniters for creating conflict between moms and dads.  And under the old system, to bring a dispute about whether or not child  support had been paid, the party that was entitled to receive child  support would have to come to court, file a contempt proceeding, hire a  lawyer, get it set on the court   s docket, there would be a hearing called  an arraignment. Very often, it would be passed over and over again. I  mean, these contempt cases that were spawned by child support  obligations, sometimes they would stretch over, literally, years. That is  not an exaggeration. Sometimes the people who were owed child  support, the moms and dads who were owed child support, they would  have to file multiple contempt actions to get any relief at all, and very  often it became apparent that it cost them more in attorney fees to collect  the child support than they stood to collect in child support. I mean, the  fallacy is so apparent.  So, I went to the presiding judge and I said,    I have an idea. I would like  to create a standalone docket to adjudicate child support collection cases.  I would call it the Child Support Enforcement docket, because,    I said,     I believe I can put a system in place that will allow people to get relief  very quickly, and I think once our community becomes aware of this  process and adjusts to the process, it will be sort of a self-enforcing  device or mechanism for motivating people to pay child support if they  owe child support.    So, I wrote this program out and the judge allowed  me to. It was Judge  Jefferson  Sellers. He allowed me to set up this  Child Support Enforcement docket, and I said,    I   ll take all the contempt  cases, all of them, from all the other family judges. I will do the  contempt cases that are filed on their dockets.    So, that   s what I did.  16  I had a very predictable process for the way these cases would move  through the Child Support Enforcement docket system. At the first  appearance, which is called the arraignment, the party who is owed the  child support is required by court order to show up in court, and they  have the opportunity at that time to enter a plea of guilty to not paying  child support or not guilty. If they say they   re not guilty, which 99  percent of them did, then we would set that matter for trial, but I didn   t  set it for trial in six months or four months. I set it for trial in thirty days  or less, and that   s what I told them at the arraignment docket. I made a  speech and I would say to everybody there,    This is an expedited  procedure for ensuring that child support is properly paid, and this is  what   s going to happen: Today there will be an arraignment. In thirty  days or less there will be a trial unless you decide to plead.    And I said,     I   m going to give you a trial date in thirty days or less. Let   s say thirty  days, and on that day that you   re set for trial   and you have to come  back, because if you don   t come back, the sheriff will come out and  arrest you. On that day, one of three things will happen and only one of  three things.  I   m going to tell you right now what those three things are. Number one:  You   re going to come in here and admit that you haven   t paid child  support, and you   re going to plead guilty to not paying child support.  You   re going to fill out a form admitting that you haven   t paid child  support and you   re going to enter into a payment plan that will obligate  you to pay child support, not only your current support but get your  arrearage taken care of, as well. Or, the party that is owed child support,  if they are, they   re going to come in here in thirty days and they   re going  to say,    All the child support has been paid, so I dismiss my case.    That   s  the ideal situation, right? Or, we will have a trial, and that trial can either  be to a judge, me, or it will be to a jury. That   s your choice; you could  have a jury trial or you can have a judge try the case.  If, at the conclusion of that trial, the trier of fact, either the jury or me,  the judge, finds that by clear and convincing evidence there has been a  willful failure to pay child support, then you   re going to be found guilty.  And I   m going to tell you what   s going to happen, right then, that day at  the end of the trial. I don   t care if it   s at midnight, this is what   s going to  happen if you   re found guilty after the trial: You   re going to go to jail.  You   re going to go to jail for six months and that   s flat time. You don   t  earn good time; it   s flat time. You will do six months in the Tulsa  County jail. You   re going to be fined  500. You are going to have any  business, professional, driver   s, recreation, occupational license that you  hold suspended. You   re also going to be ordered to pay all, all of the  attorney fees that the moving party has incurred in forcing you to do  what you already should have been doing.    And I said,    Frankly, very  often, the attorney fees are more than the child support. So, you   re going  17  to pay your own attorney fees and you   re going to pay the attorney fees  of the moving party. Now, when you go to jail, you   ll have the  opportunity to, sort of, buy your way out of jail by paying all of these  costs and fees and child support and 10 percent interest that has accrued,  and that will be assessed against you. But unless you pay it all, you   re  going to stay in jail.     Well, you know, at first they didn   t believe me. They just didn   t believe  me. I mean, that had never happened, to my knowledge, around here. So,  the first two or three months, we   d set cases for trial and, as I had told  them, if a person was found guilty, they went to jail. Now, mysteriously,  usually almost always they came up with the money once they went to  jail. A lot of times they would go ahead and pay the child support that  was owed and so the case would be dismissed. We would not have a  trial. Very often, they would enter into a plea agreement, come back in  30 days and they would enter into a plea, and they would say   let   s say  they owe  10,000. On the plea form, they would say,    Yes, I admit I  owe  10,000    we   ll say in child support    and I   m going to pay it. And  I   m going to pay it at the rate of  1,000 a month and I will also keep my  current child support paid up.    I also required them to pay the attorney  fees that the moving party had incurred in bringing this contempt case to  force the person who   s obligated to pay child support to pay the child  support. And, you know, I   d say to these people,    It   s so much easier if  you   ll just pay your child support. It   s so much cheaper if you   ll just pay  your child support.     So, anyway, if they chose that third option of entering into a plea  agreement when they came back to trial, that was fine. I mean, I didn   t  want them to go to jail. I just wanted them to pay their child support. So,  let   s say they agreed to, in writing and orally, to pay the arrearage and to  keep their current child support paid. Then I   d say,    Okay, you   re going  to come back to court in, let   s say, two months. You   re ordered to come  back to court in two months.    There   s that accountability to the court.  See, you   ve got to have the accountability factor there.    In two months  when you come back to court, I   m going to tell you right now what   s  going to happen. I   m going to be sitting up here on this bench like I am  right now, and when I call your case I   m going to ask one, and only one,  question, and I   m going to tell you right now what that question is. The  question is: Are you in compliance with your plea agreement and your  payment plan? Have you paid, as you have promised that you would  pay? I   m only going to allow you to respond with a one-syllable answer  and it   s one of two words. I want you to know right now what those two  words are. It   s either    yes    or    no.    If it   s    yes    and the moving party  agrees that you   ve paid your child support, then I   m going to send you  away and have you come back two or three months later, and we   re  going to keep doing that until you get this arrearage paid. As long as you  18  pay not only the child support but all the accrued interest, all of the  costs, all of the attorney fees, then you will not go to jail. If, in contrast,  your one-syllable answer to that one question I   m going to ask you is     no,    then I   m going to tell you to go have a seat over in the jury box by  my deputy, and you   re going to be in the custody of the Tulsa County  sheriff.     Then, once I got these dockets rolling, the very first thing I would do  when I had an arraignment docket, when all these people were showing  up for the first time that had just been cited for contempt   so, you know,  there might be fifty people sitting out there in the gallery, showing up  for court for the first time, and then all the other people that are on a  payment plan, they   re in court, too, on the same day. So, the very first  thing I would do is ask that   I   d call their case, of the people that were  coming back for the review, and I   d ask them that one question I told  them I was going to ask them. I always did exactly what I said I was  going to do so that it would be predictable. They would know what was  going to happen. I   d ask my question and they would answer. If the  answer was    no,    I would usually get this response,    Uh, well, the  reason          No, remember it   s a one-syllable answer. Is your answer     yes    or    no   ?       Well, I haven   t          No, I   m not going to listen to  excuses. I need to know if your answer is    yes    or    no,       and they   d  ultimately say,    No,    maybe, and so I   d sit them over there in the jury  box.  Now, after the docket was over, I would talk to those people and find out  why they hadn   t paid. I mean, if they   d been in the hospital or  something, that   s one thing, but usually they had just not made it a  priority. You know, they made their car payments and they bought their  cigarettes and they made all these other choices, but they chose not to  pay child support. But I wanted the people who were on the docket for  the first time to know what was going to happen, and it had this  wonderful self-enforcing effect I predicted. So, after about six months,  people just started paying their child support because they knew what  was going to happen if they didn   t. And, I mean, within that first year  and a half, I think by the end of that second year, we had generated over   2 million in child support. I mean, it was unbelievable. And people  were getting in and out of the system in thirty days and they were getting  their child   I mean, I had the people who had custody of the children  and were supposed to be getting the child support, I had them write  some compelling letters and come and tell me some compelling stories  about the difference it had made in the lives of their children, for their  children to get child support finally after all these years.  One lady I remember said,    I   ve been trying to get child support for  eighteen years.    Eighteen years. And she said,    He would never pay  19  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  child support and I   d bring him to court, and they   d say    Now, do better  and come back and tell me that you   ve paid your child support in six  months,    and he   d come back and he hadn   t paid. He had some excuse,  and they   d tell him to come back six months later and to do better.    She  said,    Finally, with the Rocket Docket,    that   s what it was fondly called,  the Rocket Docket because it went so fast, you know,    he paid his child  support and he got all of his child support paid, and it was a lot of  money.     Well, it   s great that you could look at the system, see a problem, find a  way to fix it, and then you see the results.  Right, that   s the best part, seeing the results, yes.  I can see how it could be stretched out over months, but if you say,     Thirty days,    I mean, that kind of puts the fear in you. It   s like,    Oh,  something   s going to happen now.    Is the Rocket Docket still in place?  Yes, it   s still in place. Yes, it is.  Well, that   s great too. The longevity of     Yes, I guess we implemented that docket maybe in, I don   t know,    97. I  can   t remember exactly, but it is still in place. It   s still fondly referred to  as the    Rocket Docket,    and I think it   s still effective in forcing people  to pay the child support that they   re obligated to pay. That   s the whole  idea.  Well, something else you were very key and instrumental in working on  was the community sentencing program.  Yes, yes. You   re bringing so many wonderful memories to mind. I was  assigned a felony criminal docket in like 2000 or 2001, something like  that. It was very apparent to not only me but to the legislators, the  lawmakers, that the way we had been dealing with non-violent   I   m  talking about non-violent   the way we had been dealing with non-violent  felony offenders was very expensive, very counterproductive,  and very ineffective in that we would incarcerate them   we had this  exploding prison population. It was a revolving door. You know, we  would put them in prison for a few months or maybe a few years, they   d  get out, they   d re-offend, and 60 percent of the time they   d come right  back through the criminal justice system doors. And, again, there was no  intervention. There was no opportunity to jump off of that drug-infested  kind of lifestyle that they had, for whatever reason, adopted.  So, the legislature and legislators enacted a law called the Community  20  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Sentencing Law. And I can   t take credit for the law, I didn   t write the  law, but I did have the very good fortune of implementing the law when  it was enacted. Because when it was enacted by the legislature, I was on  a felony docket and most of my cases were drug-related cases. So, I  wrote, with the help of a judicial intern named Vicky Brant, a bench  book, which is what judges use to assist them when they are trying to  apply a body of law that might be unfamiliar to them. So, I wrote with  Ms. Brant this bench book, this thick book, that was designed to help the  judges around the whole state of Oklahoma adopt and utilize this  wonderful new law that was more socially responsible than the old    lock  them up and throw away the key    model. It was kind of like Drug Court,  those same, sort of, social engineering procedures that exposed people to  alternative lifestyles that were not the drug-riddled lifestyle that they had  led theretofore. I think it has been reasonably successful, and I know  over the years that they   ve tweaked it and it   s still a body of legislation  that can be utilized in the criminal courts to manage non-violent  offenders so that they stay in the community. They get treatment, they  get counseling, they get job training.  That was another thing about the Child Support Enforcement docket that  I forgot to mention. It was a part of the docket that I was really proud of.  Some of those people   I remember one woman in particular said she  couldn   t pay child support because she didn   t have a job. So, I, after she  was found guilty and put in jail, I arranged for her to participate in this  program that was called a day release program where they would go out  into the community and work in the community, and then they would  come back to jail at night. And all but something like three dollars a day  of the money they earned every day went toward their child support  obligation. And then when they got it paid in full, of course, they got out  of jail. That particular woman, I recall, got a job as a result of that  program, and even after she got her child support paid and she got out of  jail, she stayed on that job. And she told me for the first time in her life,  she was gainfully employed, and she told me that with a big smile on her  face. I mean, she took great pride in that accomplishment, that she was  able to get a job and hold it down.  We were talking about some of your earlier dockets. So, after the Family  Court and Drug Court and the Community Sentencing Program and all  those good things, what was your next docket?  Then I had an opportunity to take on a probate docket, which is yet  another specialized discipline. And so, I guess   oh, you know these  years are just running together, but I don   t know. Maybe about 2003 or  so, when the judge who had been on that probate docket for about  eighteen years retired, I got to take that probate docket, and I loved it.  Again, it was one of those dockets where I could work with families in a  21  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  sort of nurturing way while they were going through a difficult part of  life, which was the loss of a loved one. I also, as a part of that docket,  did adoptions, and then for awhile I did guardianships as well. But,  again, those were cases involving sensitive, kind of, social issues that I  have a real passion for and that I find very gratifying. I guess one reason  I went into teaching and got a counseling degree was because of this  yearning to support people and assist people when they find themselves  in need of that kind of assistance, and the probate docket sort of lent  itself to meeting that need that I have. So, it was just a fabulous  experience. I was on that docket for maybe three or four years, I guess,  then I had an opportunity again when a judge left this civil docket. I had  an opportunity to take on this civil docket, and these cases on this  particular docket are usually disputes involving, like, breach of contract  or personal injury or wrongful death, those kinds of cases. It   s very  different than the types of cases I have handled heretofore, but it   s  enjoyable for me to become immersed in a different body of law, which  is civil procedure and the discovery code and the evidence code and so  on. So, I   m thoroughly enjoying this docket, as well.  Is there a pecking order to the dockets?  Well, some might argue that there is. I can   t say, for me, I would  consider one docket preferable to another. I have tried to avail myself of  opportunities to take on new bodies of law and new types of cases, and  preside over as many different types of dockets as I could for my judicial  career. And I, so far, have been able to do that, and now I   m on one of  the few dockets that I haven   t presided over, which is the civil docket.  I   ve been here for a year, thoroughly enjoy it. The only other specialized  docket is a juvenile docket and it   s out in a totally separate building.  Haven   t done that yet, and who knows whether or not my career will  make that opportunity available but, for right now, I   m very happy with  the docket I have.  I   d like to just take a step back for a second and have you tell me a little  bit about Lucille.  Oh. (Laughs) Well, when I was in law school, a friend of mine named  Ann Powers was a social worker for DHS, and I remember one day she  told me that she had gone out to meet with a woman who somehow was  involved in the DHS system. She must have received DHS services, and  Ann described this little lady that was living in a one-room garage  apartment. She was bedfast because she was crippled with arthritis. She  could not walk, her little hands were all shriveled up like this, and her  feet were shriveled up. She lived alone in this little garage apartment.  She did have people who would come by and bring food to her. I mean,  can you imagine not being able to get out of bed? She had a little, old,  22  pitiful, tiny, black and white television that got very poor reception with  the rabbit ears. My friend Ann noticed that this garage apartment just  seemed to be infested with roaches and was unsanitary, but one thing she  told me about Lucille that really endeared her to me before I even met  her, and that was that Lucille had long, gray hair. And Ann described  how she would brush her hair and then very carefully put her hair in  braids, and then she would take the braids and intertwine them on top of  her head, and on top of the braids she would put a little red ribbon. So,  here was this poor little lady, living in this roach-infested, nasty, one-room  apartment, confined to her bed, passing her days with nothing to  entertain her but some books from the library, thank goodness for those,  and this little television that had terrible reception.  And so, I said,    Ann, I want to meet Lucille. Can I?    So, she arranged  for me to go and meet Lucille and, boy, I walked in and my heart melted  because she was just as Ann described. That little red bow was perched  on top of her head, and I just became attached to her. My grandmother  had always been a huge part of my life. I lived on the farm with her for  the first seven years of my life, and so I had this affinity for elderly  people, anyway, and Lucille was inspiring to me because here she lived,  she was destined to this life that most people would find almost  unbearable, and yet, she chose to do what she could to make life good  for herself, right down to grooming herself and putting this little red bow  on top of her head. So, I became friends with her, and I would go see her  periodically. It turned out that Lucille had no family. She had no  children, she had no siblings, she had, of course, no parents at that point.  She had two or three friends that would call her, because they were  disabled, too. But the only human contact she had was with caregivers.  And some of those people were really wonderful and some of them were  not so wonderful.  So, I became very attached to Lucille. By that time, my grandmother had  passed away. I graduated from law school, so I was leaving Norman to  come to Tulsa where I had a job, and it just broke my heart to leave  Lucille behind. So, my twin sister Laurie, Laurie Pettis   We have a lot  of the same philosophies in life, I guess, and the same ambitions about  trying to leave this world better than we found it and, so, I enlisted her to  help me and, together, the two of us put together this little plan to move  Lucille to Tulsa where we both were. We got our husbands to borrow a  couple of pickup trucks and go to Oklahoma City, load up what few  pitiful little belongings Lucille had, which included, by the way, a color  television set because I had arranged to get her a color television set. So,  she had her color television set; it was quite a prize for her. And we  moved her to Tulsa to this little apartment that we had found, which was  a nice, tidy, clean little apartment down here on 15th Street. Got her all  set up; she was just as happy as she could be. My twin sister Laurie was  23  very involved in tending to Lucille and spending time with her and so  on. And about, oh I don   t know, three or four weeks into her stay there,  she told us that the landlord had come by, and when the landlord  discovered how disabled she was and the fact that she was bedfast, the  landlord said that she was going to have to move out because he didn   t  want the liability of her being in his apartment.  So, we went to work trying to find alternative housing for her, which we  ultimately did, and moved her over there. Got her all settled in, and she  was there for quite some time. I remember one caregiver she had stole  Lucille   s Social Security check after she had gotten it cashed. She had  someone cash it for her, and after she   d gotten it cashed, this lady took  her money. We were just so   I mean, we knew it had to be this  particular caregiver. We were just so incensed by that that my sister  Laurie decided that we were going to sue that lady in small claims. Now,  Laurie also has a law degree, but is not any more comfortable in  litigation than I was at the time. But still she wanted to hold that woman  accountable for taking Lucille   s money. So, she filed a small claims  case, and on the day of the hearing, we loaded Lucille up on this gurney,  if you can imagine that, because she couldn   t even travel in a wheel  chair. She had no muscular control, she was so crippled by arthritis. We  brought her down here to the courthouse, and my twin sister Laurie  actually did this, brought her to the courthouse and when the case was  called, she wheeled Lucille up in front of the judge and she made her  argument and asked Lucille questions about who had taken her money  and so on. And the lady that was accused of having taken it, which we  think did, showed up and she just said,    I didn   t take it. No, I didn   t.     Well, there was no corroborating evidence, there was no eyewitness,  there was no confession, there was nothing to substantiate. It was just a  swearing match. So, the judge ruled against Lucille. He did not find this  woman had taken Lucille   s money. So, you know, we lost the case but  we tried.  Anyway, so Lucille stayed here until she passed away, which was two or  three years later, perhaps, and she spent her last days over here in this  hospital, Tulsa Regional, which is not too far. I just live a few blocks  from here so I got to go see her over there. And it was just a very  rewarding experience for me, because it gave me the opportunity to  connect with someone who had taken her life   s circumstances and made  the best of it and found joy in the life that she had and the meager  existence she experienced. She managed to find some way to enjoy life  and to feel satisfaction with life. And I just, to this day, greatly admire  Lucille for the way she chose to live her life, and it was a conscious  choice, of course. So, it was a real gift to me, a blessing from God to me  and to my sister that we had the opportunity to know Lucille for at least  just a short time.  24  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  I remember when we were moving her back from Oklahoma City, we  were on the Turner Turnpike and we looked like the Beverly Hillbillies.  You know, we had two pickup trucks, my husband John Nicks and my  sister   s husband, and we had those trucks loaded down with her few  personal possessions, and my sister had eaten something and she started  experiencing the symptoms of what was apparently food poisoning, so  we had to pull off the road and we got out. (Laughs) And by that time, I  started getting sick, and pretty soon all four of us were sick, and we were  just lying, you know, out on the side of the Turner Turnpike, sick as  dogs. Poor little Lucille was with us. She was the only one that didn   t  get sick. (Laughs) Anyway, it was quite an experience.  Well, you seem to bring this level of passion to everything you do, be it  helping others, or as a judge, or helping the community. So, that   s really  nice to see.  Thank you, thank you. I try.  Also, jumping back just a little bit, you spoke about going to college and  going to law school. Did you always think you would go to school?  Oh, yes. There was not ever any consideration of the fact that all of my  mother   s children would go to college. She went to college and  graduated with a teaching degree, and she was also a journalist in  Washington, D.C. for a while before she married. Now, my dad had not  gone to college. He only went to the ninth grade, but he was a pretty  smart guy, I   m told. He died when I was thirteen, so I didn   t know him  real well over the duration of my life. But my mother believed in  education firmly, and the circumstances of my childhood were such that  our financial resources were very, very limited, especially after we  moved to Tulsa and we weren   t living in Grandmother   s house anymore.  There were five children and my mother and my father, and we lived on  a pretty meager income stream. Mother used to always say to us,    The  ticket out of poverty is through education, so all of you must get your  education. You must stay in school until you get your education.    So, we  all have.  Three of the girls ended up going through law school. My older sister,  Kathleen Duncan, has almost a PhD, in addition to, she has a law degree.  My twin has a law degree, and my little sister, Jeannie, has a degree in  finance. So, we all went on to college. My older brother, Joe, who   s the  smartest one of all of us, went to Vietnam when he was eighteen years  old, I believe, and he was one of the casualties of Vietnam because he  suffered a breakdown there. So, when he came back to this country, he  was never able to function completely independently again and to this  day isn   t. But he   s a wonderful, wonderful, kind, loving man. Very  25  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  smart but, you know, he has to live with the effects of having been in a  war zone in Vietnam back in the sixties. So, he   s the only one that  doesn   t have an education. And all of us have imparted that same  commitment to education, Ima Jeane is her name, Ima Jeane Payne  Morrissey instilled in us. So, my three children have never even  considered the possibility of not going on to college when they finish  high school. I mean, high school is just a baby step toward completing  their education.  Well, we learn the tools we need in our career from many different  places.  Yes.  Sometimes we learn it in the classroom and sometimes we learn it  elsewhere. Where are some of the places that you   ve learned your tools  for sitting on the bench?  Oh, wow. Well, first of all, at the feet of my grandmother, Ella Payne.  Kind, compassionate, gentle, generous woman who came from  Arkansas, married when she was sixteen, moved to Oklahoma to this  farm in I guess the late teens and worked hard throughout her life, very  hard. But she always made time for things that she valued. For example,  she always went to church; she was a very strong Christian woman. She  always found a way to get to church and if she didn   t have  transportation, she would literally hitchhike from the country to the  church in Haskell that she attended. She was a kind person and made an  effort to identify people who were in need for whatever reason, whether  it was clothing or food or housing. Whatever the need was, if she  recognized it, and she had an eye for that sort of thing, then she set about  trying to meet that need. People sometimes would come down there to  the farm, and the farm is about halfway between Haskell and Coweta.  So, sometimes people would come to her and say,    I   m hungry. I can   t  feed my family.    So, she would go to her orchard that she developed and  tended and get fruit from her trees, and go to her garden and get  vegetables, and to her henhouse and get eggs and sometimes chickens to  feed the people. She always said,    Feed the hungry, clothe the poor.     She really believed in those biblical principles and she practiced those  principles.  She and my grandfather bought this farm down there in Wagoner  County, and during the Depression they were unable to pay their bills.  So, she used to tell the story about the banker that held the mortgage  coming to the farm, driving up to the farm, and she went out to meet  him. I guess they had come to recognize his vehicle or something. So,  she went out to meet him and she said,    If you   ll just give me a few  26  Nykolaiszyn  more days, I will sell my chickens to make the payment,    and that   s  what she did. She sold all of her chickens and she made the payment.  And then Grandfather was able to make, Jim Payne, he was able to  somehow make money and keep their mortgage paid and so they didn   t  lose the farm as a result. So, anyway, they were very hard-working, salt  of the earth, good, wise, kind people. And she instilled all of those  values in me, those spiritual values, the work ethic, I hope a sense of  compassion. And my mother had many of those same values. Now,  Mother was very, very committed to education, as I   ve already said, and  she insisted that all of us pursue our education and advanced degrees.  She was a teacher some of the time we were growing up. Some of the  time she did substitute teaching and some of the time she just tended to  us. But she insisted that all of us   she   d always say,    Hold your head  high, girls. We may be poor, but we have respect and we respect each  other. We   re going to respect ourselves.    So, she instilled those same  values in us about believing in ourselves and doing what was within our  ability wherever we were at any given point, and I   m talking about    we     in a generic kind of sense, to meet the needs of those around us, a belief  that my mother held firm. If she saw someone lying on the street, she  didn   t just keep driving on by. She would stop and attend to them and  assist them in whatever way she could.  So, those values of attending to other people, identifying the needs of  other people, meeting the needs of other people, all of which is a part of  what I do now every day and it   s what I   ve been doing for a long time,  in part were instilled in me by my parents. My father was a very, very  hard worker. As I said, I didn   t know him nearly as well as I wish I  could have because he died when I was so young, but people always told  me that he was a very good man and that he was one that a person could  always call on for assistance if they needed it and so on. So, I think he  must have had the same sort of commitments to that sort of  humanitarian-type lifestyle that my mother did and my grandmother.  Incidentally, my mother had a brother named Wesley, Wesley Payne. He  farmed down there with my grandmother and his wife, Ada, my aunt.  They were a very significant part of our raising, as well, of our  upbringing, because Wesley did a little bit better than my mother did  financially, and so he shared his resources with us. I mean, they would  buy clothes for us and shoes for us, and sometimes they   d take us on  little trips. Again, it was just that family commitment to all binding  together and working together to help each other be healthy and stable  and have a good life. So, it was a real family value, I guess, that we all  held, and just as they were there for us, we have tried to be there for our  aunt and uncle and other members of our family as they   ve grown into  old age and then passed on.  Well, that   s just great to see, and hopefully that trend will continue.  27  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  I hope so. Boy, I sure want to instill that in my kids. And it   s such a  balance because it   s a funny thing how you want to give your children  everything that you didn   t have. You   re going to find that out when you  have children. You want your children to have everything you didn   t  have, and yet, you want to instill in them a sense of appreciation and  compassion, and you want them to be able to connect with the needs of  other people. So, sometimes you kind of have to step back and try to  bring some balance back into giving them too much, you know. Like my  little girl this summer has applied to be a counselor at the MDA camp.  Those are the kinds of experiences that I want her to have so that she  will have that enriching experience of helping someone else. I mean, it   s  so hugely rewarding as everyone knows, yourself included, that lends a  hand to someone else; it is so richly rewarding to the giver.  Tell me a couple of your biggest highlights within your career. I always  ask for the biggest highlight, but then everybody seems to have multiple,  so you can share a few if you would like.  Okay, now we   re talking about my career. I   m going to answer that in  terms of my career, because I would have to say that my career has not  been the highlight of my life. But within my career, I think the highlight  so far would be the Child Support Enforcement docket and Families in  Transition. Those two programs I feel like I had a big part in bringing to  fruition. I was a part of creating those programs and a part of  implementing those programs and then observing the very positive  effects of those programs. So, I would say being a judge and being a part  of implementing those two programs would definitely be the highlight of  my career so far.  And outside of your career?  And outside of my career it would definitely be my family. I   m very  blessed to have a wonderful, wonderful husband   this is where I get  emotional   and three wonderful children. They hold the strings to my  heart, because they   re so precious. And I feel so blessed to have married  the wonderful man I did, and I feel so blessed to have had three  wonderful children. They   ve brought me the most joy and the most pain,  I guess, in my life so far. I   m sorry I   m getting emotional. I can   t believe  I am. But anyway, certainly, outside my career, my family. My  wonderful husband, my wonderful, wonderful children, Denver, Travis,  and Savannah, and then my wonderful family of origin. You know, I  have a twin sister, Laurie, who   s angelic. I mean, I tell people that she   s  an angel here on the face of this earth. She is. And I have a wonderful  older sister, Kathleen Duncan, and my little sister, Jeannie Morrissey,  who is precious. She, in some ways, was more like a child to me than a  sister. We still call her    honey    and    baby    because she was the baby of  28  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  the family. And then my wonderful, kind, loving big brother, Joseph. So,  for sure, the best part of my life so far has been my family relationships.  Well, turning to the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame, you were  inducted in 2003. When you were notified, what was going through your  mind at that time?  Oh, it   s like, you can remember where you were when world events  occur, and I remember where I was. I had the probate docket at the time.  I was sitting at my desk, my phone was behind me as it is now, and they  said I had a call. I turned around and answered the phone, and they told  me that I had been selected for the Women   s Hall of Fame. And I  remember saying,    I think you must have the wrong number. This is  Linda Morrissey,    and the lady said,    Yes, we know you   re       I mean,  it was so out of the blue; I had no idea that I had been nominated for it. I  certainly, even if I had known that, I wouldn   t have in my wildest  dreams believed that I would have been fortunate enough to have been  selected for it. So, gosh, it was a moment of disbelief and a moment of  humility and a moment of just ecstasy. You know, it was just thrilling to  have gotten that award.  And did you attend the ceremony?  Oh, yes, I did. In fact, I have the certificate over my computer monitor,  so I get to see it every day. And yes, I did attend. It happened that it was  on March 27, 2003, which was my fiftieth birthday. My twin sister was  there and, you know, I was so emotional that I only spoke for about  thirty seconds. You know, we were allotted five minutes and I had a  five-minute speech that I had rehearsed at length, but I was so  emotional, I couldn   t keep my composure. And so I just got up and read  this very short poem that was just a tiny part of my speech. I wasn   t even  able to wish my twin sister who was there in the audience  a  happy  birthday or say,    This is our fiftieth birthday.    I just couldn   t. I was  too   I was euphoric and it was just one of those moments that was so  intense, I simply could not speak without losing my composure as I did a  few moments ago when I was talking about my husband and my  children. And I didn   t want to make the audience uncomfortable by  tearing up, you know. I just, in the moment, decided to read this little  poem and that was it. But, yes, I was absolutely there; all my children  were there. I remember my son, Denver, jumping up and down. It was a  wonderful moment in my life.  Well, how do you feel that now women look at you as that role model?  Well, I love to teach to this day. I do teach regularly, and I love to  mentor young people. I am known as having more judicial interns than  29  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  any of the other judges, and I get kidded about that because the other  judges say I am greedy and I get all the interns, and I do get as many as I  can. They help me tremendously, but I love teaching them. And I hope  that I can be a role model or a mentor that conveys to young people,  both men and women, the fact I believe that one can have a rewarding,  fulfilling career and have a wonderful family life and home life. That   s  what I aspire to. You know, I used to tell my kids that I wanted to be the  kind of mother that would cause them to believe they had a stay-at-home  mom. I wanted to be so available to them that they wouldn   t know the  difference between a stay-at-home mom and a working mom. And  likewise, I wanted to be the kind of lawyer and judge that one might  describe as someone who has donated or dedicated their life to that  avocation, that had nothing else in their life except being a good judge or  a good lawyer. So, those values I want to pass on to those young people  that follow in my footsteps.  I speak a lot about ethics, for example. I go to the law school and I tell  these law students,    Every moment of every day, you make one decision  after another that builds your reputation, and it is one of the most  valuable assets or commodities that you have. You can lose it in a split  second of indiscretion or being dishonest, and it   s not something that  you can ever recover from fully. Once you compromise your ethics and  your morals, it   s not something from which one can fully recover, ever,  over the course of their life.    So, I tell them to guard it and treasure it  and protect it. And I tell them little stories about moments in time when,  in a moment of indiscretion as I say, someone did compromise their  values or compromise their ethics and their reputation. So, it   s those  kinds of values, work ethic, compassion, all of the things that I hope I  am true to and I hope I invest in everything I do. I want to pass on to the  young people who will follow in my footsteps.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oh, I love Oklahoma. I call it God   s country. When I was in law school,  I worked in California one summer and I used to say,    I am from  Oklahoma. I am from God   s country.    There is not a single place on the  face of this globe where I would want to be other than Oklahoma. I don   t  think there   s a more wonderful place in the world, not that I   ve traveled  that widely, but I   ve been outside of the United States a few times and  I   ve certainly been around the United States some. This is just a  wonderful, wonderful place to live. I feel so fortunate to live in  Oklahoma. The people are the kind of people I want to be around.  They   re the kind of people that I want to influence my children. They   re  kind, good, loving, compassionate people. The weather, I love the  weather. I love the way the weather changes; I love the fact that it   s  unpredictable. It   s beautiful, particularly in the northeastern part of the  30  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  state that I live in. It   s beautiful. Even the western part of the state has its  own kind of beauty. And there   s such diversity in this state in terms of  culture and in terms of topography, in terms of the people that inhabit  our state. It   s just a wonderful place to live. I would never ever, ever  want to live anywhere but Oklahoma.  So, what   s next on the agenda for you?  (Laughs) Oh, Juliana, I don   t know. You know, I will be eligible to retire  in six or seven years, something like that, and I don   t know whether I  will retire then. I mean, I love my work. I have such a fabulous  opportunity to be a part of people   s lives in this world and this  community. So, I don   t know whether I will retire when I am eligible or  not. If I do, it will only be to use whatever skill set I have in some other  endeavor. I want to be a quote    stay-at-home grandma    for at least a  portion of my next life, where I will be the kind of doting grandma that  my grandmother was. You know, she used to make side apple pies in her  little kitchen there on the farm, and my twin sister, Laurie, and I would  be flanking her on both sides, rolling out the dough. And these were side  apple pies from apples that she had harvested from her garden, from her  orchard. So, I want to be that kind of grandma that reads to my  grandchildren and plays games with them and makes them feel like they  are the most important creature on the face of the earth. I want to keep  giving to my community somehow, some way, I don   t know, maybe in  politics. I don   t know really what the future will hold, but I do hope that  I will continue to be able to make a contribution on some level as my life  goes forward.  Alright, so this is a good question, but     It   s not going to make me cry again, right? (Laughs)  It may, it may. It   s always nice to end on this question, but when history  is written about you     Oh, wow.     what would you like for it to say?  Gracious me. I want history to reflect on me as, first of all, a good mom,  a wonderful mom and a good and wonderful wife, a good sister and  daughter and granddaughter. You know, all those relationships, those are  the most important parts of my life, my relationships with my family. I  want history to be able to say that I made a difference in my community  and that I had a positive effect on my community, that I continued  throughout my life to use whatever skills or influence I had to help other  31  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  people and to improve the lives of other people, to have a positive  impact in my world, in whatever little way I can. I want there to be a  history of having left a positive impact on my family and on the world  around me, like on my children, for example. I want to instill in my  children the values that I   ve talked about here today like compassion,  and extending a hand to someone else, and looking for opportunities to  extend a hand. They   re there; sometimes we have to look for them.  Sometimes we   re buried in needs. But no matter, I hope that I can instill  in my offspring, my children, that value to make a difference for other  people, to be kind and compassionate, to be humble, to never, ever reach  a point where one might feel like they   re superior to any other human, or  that they   re entitled to privileges that someone else might not be entitled  to. So, I guess that   s what I would say. The kind of values that I pass on  to those I can influence.  Well, we   ve covered a lot today, kind of a nice wide stroke. Is there  anything else you   d like to add that I have not asked you?  Well, one thing I will say to you is I love to quilt. That   s kind of one of  my hobbies, quilting and gardening. And, you know, Grandmother was  quite a gardener. She had beautiful flower gardens. People would drive  all the way out to our little country home from town to see her flower  gardens. So, to this day, I have flowers all the way around my home. I  bet you already   here it is, what, the second week of May? I bet I   ve put  out fifty or sixty flats of bedding plants, and I couldn   t even tell you how  many rose bushes I have. And my sweet husband has fruit trees  around   we live in downtown Tulsa, you know, but he still has fruit  trees in our yard. And, so, we   re big into gardening, and I think that was  a love that was instilled by my grandmother. And, then, I love quilting.  She was also a quilter. And, to me, quilts are works of art. I think of a  quilt as something that just can envelop a person and make you feel safe  and warm and nurtured. So, I guess I quilt with that ambition, that I   m  creating something tangible that will be that source of warmth and  comfort and sense of well-being to other people. Plus, they   re works of  art.  And I love old things. As you can see, my office is filled with old relics.  I guess that   s my way to try to just hang on to history and eras that  precede me. I have wonderful friends that enrich my life every day.  Friends I think will be there for the rest of my life. I have a strong  spiritual dimension that is personal and my own. I believe it is very  important to respect the spiritual beliefs of other people and honor those,  whatever those spiritual beliefs are. I certainly have very strong spiritual  beliefs, and I endeavor to and believe that I should respect the spiritual  beliefs of others. So, it   s a very private, personal part of my life for me.  32  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Nykolaiszyn  Morrissey  Do you still have some of Grandma   s quilts?  I actually have one of my grandmother   s quilts. My sisters and, actually,  my cousin, who was also her granddaughter, Arnetta, she   s like my  sister. She   s wonderful, and her brothers Mark and Dale   I think they  have some of Grandma   s quilts. I hope they do because it   s just a part of  our connection to our grandmother who was such a huge influence for  all of us, and continues, I think, to affect the way we live our own lives  and the mark that we are creating and making here on this earth.  Another thing I had the privilege of doing during my career is working  on a women offender task force to try to understand why we here in  Oklahoma, very often in Tulsa, Oklahoma, incarcerate more women per  capita than any place in the world, any place on the globe. We, right here  in this state, in this wonderful state I love so much, we put more women  in prison per capita than any other single geographic community in the  world. It   s really inexplicable to me, and so for several years I worked  on a committee, I chaired a committee, I worked on the governor   s task  force as a designee, an individual appointed to that task force, and just  here within the courthouse, we   ve endeavored to try to understand that  fact and remedy that fact. We   ve made some progress but, my goodness,  we have a long way to go, a long, long way to go. I think there has to be  a more intelligent way to deal with people who are drug offenders. And  most of these incarcerated women are drug offenders or they   re  supporting someone   s drug habit. They   re usually nonviolent, and that   s  usually how they end up in the penal system is because of underlying  drug issues. And, gosh, the social fallout on their children, their family,  their own health, both physical and mental health, the cost associated  with the consequences of incarcerating women on society at large. You  know, providing for their families, providing for their children, attending  to their own physical and social and mental health needs. The cost is  staggering. It   s just not a very intelligent way to address the problem.  So, that, you talk about something I need to do in the future, that   s  certainly a project that I need to invest time in and future in to try to at  least begin to resolve that problem.  That   s definitely a problem in Oklahoma. If you could come up with a  good system, boy, that would be great.  Yes, and there has to be a way to do it. We just need to find out what  that is, so hopefully we will.  I hope so. Well, thank you very much for taking time out of your busy  schedule today to meet with us. I do appreciate it so much.  Thank you, Juliana. It was really an honor to be interviewed and to be  33  selected for the Women   s Hall of Fame. I appreciate your interest so  much; I think this is a wonderful project. I would love to hear the  interviews of the other women. So, thank you.  -------  -------
