 Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Monday, March 16, 2009. I am in Oklahoma City  interviewing Nancy Coats-Ashley. This interview is being conducted as  part of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral History Project.  Nancy Coats-Ashley was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame in 2005. Thank you for joining us today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. If you could, please  give us a snapshot into your early life growing up.  I was born in Ohio and my family, which consisted of my mother and  my father and an older brother and a younger brother, moved to  Phoenix, Arizona when I was eight. So I went to public school in  Phoenix and then to high school at West Phoenix High School. From  there I went to college in Los Angeles at Occidental College, then to the  University of Arizona in Tucson from which I graduated. I then entered  the law school at the University of Arizona where I completed two years  before moving to Oklahoma and finishing at OU  University of  Oklahoma  my last year of law school. So I   ve been a lawyer all my life.  Going back to your elementary school, middle school, high school days,  were your schools really large or quite small?  My schools were quite large.  And during those early days, what were some of your favorite subjects?  You know, I saw that question on the little form that you sent, and I  don   t know that I had a favorite subject, but I do know that I worked  hard at all the subjects because it was important to get good grades. I  5  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  can   t say that I really loved history or some other course. I just was  interested in getting good grades and a scholarship so that I could go to  college.  And when you were younger, did you have aspirations to be a lawyer, or  did you want to be something else?  Interesting enough, in the eighth grade I wrote a career paper on law as  my career. I had never met a lawyer, I don   t think there were even any  television shows that featured lawyers at that time. But I remember  seeing on the news pictures of people in front of the United States  Capitol. They were lawyers, and they carried attach   cases. And I  thought, those are people that make things happen, and I   d like to be  one. Of course there weren   t any women in those pictures. But I went  through high school still thinking maybe I could go to law school, but  that wasn   t something that was encouraged in the 1950s. I went through  college getting a degree in education, thinking that I would go back to  my home in Phoenix and live with my parents, save my money while I  was teaching and then maybe I could go to law school. But as it worked  out, after getting my teaching degree, I got a small graduate fellowship  which enabled me to enter law school to see if I liked it and if it liked me  and I stayed and finished law school.  Were there a lot of women when you entered law school in your classes?  No, there actually was one other women in my first year of class at the  University of Arizona law school. And then when I graduated, there was  one other women in my graduating class. So we were definitely in the  minority.  And why the switch to OU?  I married an Okie, so I transferred here and I   ve been here more or less  ever since. I like Oklahoma a lot.  Let   s talk a little bit about what happens after law school. What did you  go on to do?  Well, I tried to find a job as a lawyer, which wasn   t easy if you were a  woman at that time. Law firms thought you might get pregnant and how  could you represent a client if you were expecting a baby? Those were  the times that even school teachers were asked to give up teaching after  they were three months pregnant. So it was not easy to find a job as a  lawyer. I was fortunate that I found a job as a federal law clerk. I did that  up until my first child was born in 1966. And then subsequently had a  second child in 1968, so I was home as a mother when my children were  6  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  young. In 1972, I was hired as the first woman lawyer for Southwestern  Bell Telephone Company in the five state area of Southwestern Bell  Telephone, and that   s Arkansas, Texas, Missouri, Kansas and  Oklahoma. So that was an interesting experience too. It   s not always  pleasant or easy to be the first.  What were some of your early challenges upon accepting that job?  I was not in a position to get any help from a mentor or anyone because  there were no women who were at the same level that I was in the legal  department. I did find though that I had a very understanding boss. And  from time to time I noticed that if a case came into our office where we  were being sued out of Muskogee or somewhere, he would give that  case to one of the men so I wouldn   t have to travel out of town. And in a  way, that really was a favor for me because I would be juggling  babysitters and child care and leaving early in the morning to be at a  motion docket in Muskogee at nine. It was a bit of a challenge. So I  thought that he sort of looked after me and I appreciated that.  And then also juggling family,  that was  probably pretty tough.  Yes. That was not an easy thing to do. And you know, it sounds like the  old ages, and it was, but in the early 1970s when I was practicing law,  there were no wardrobes for professional women. It was very  challenging to find clothing that was not too masculine and not too  feminine but just right. We   ve come a long way in those lines now  because there are so many career clothing lines for women who are  professionals.  Now out of your work with Southwestern Bell here in Oklahoma, you  eventually moved to Washington DC.  I did.  Can you touch on that for me a little bit?  I accepted a job offer at that time with AT T. We were one big Bell  system and it was not uncommon to get a rotational assignment in  Washington or New York. When that opportunity became available in  1982, I took a job in the Washington, D.C. office. It was an interesting  time because as soon as I got there, that anti-trust case against the Bell  system was resolved, and the Baby Bells were born. So I was part  AT T but then I watched as SBC and Bell South and Pacific Telesis  and Ameritech emerged in the Washington environment, each setting up  their own Washington public affairs office. So I switched then from  AT T. I had the opportunity to go with the new SBC Washington  7  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  office. That was an interesting time to be there during that evolution of  the   as they call them the Baby Bells. Which now we   ve come full  circle, as you know, and after five years in Washington being sort of a  lobbyist you would interact with some of the staff people on the Hill, or  attend committee hearings to monitor certain legislation and then feed  that information back to your headquarters, which for us was St. Louis at  that time. But in 1987, I had an opportunity to return to Oklahoma and at  that time it was called SBC, and I finished out my career with the Bell  system.  Now did your family move with you to D.C.?  My son moved up there with me and started high school. My daughter  stayed and finished high school here in Oklahoma City. Never an easy  decision. But it was not any different for a woman than it was for a man  because I remember hearing a colleague of mine who worked for  Ameritech, and when he moved in from Chicago to the Washington  office, his teenage daughter told him,    You   ve ruined my life.    You  know it   s hard on families. And I think in the long run, she appreciated  the opportunity after she adjusted in a new high school. But it   s a plus  and minus situation for children, I think.  So after you retired from SBC here in Oklahoma, what did you go on to  do?  I was at a point in my career with the Bell system that they were  downsizing and offering company buyouts and you   d hear a lot of  rumors and then you   d have a flurry of people retiring. When the right  time came and the right offer was made I thought that it would be a good  time to leave, but I wanted to have something else to do. So I ran for  district judge and got elected the end of 1994 and was sworn in in 1995.  Did you ever think that you would see yourself in that position as a  judge, or were you just happy and content being a lawyer?  I didn   t really have aspirations to become a judge, but I always admired  those who were on the bench, and I certainly admire them more now that  I   ve been there because it   s a very challenging place to be where you   re  making those decisions that affect people   s lives so critically.  How did you campaign the first time you were elected?  In 1994 when I was running, my particular position for which I was  running was a county-wide seat, so we had to cover the entire county  which meant signs going up all over and having teams that would come  and build their signs, and then you   d have them place the signs. You   d  8  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  also do flyers and mailings. I had a wonderful friend who had been  president of the nurses    association and she sent a postcard to all of the  Oklahoma County nurses who belonged to the association. Also, you  would try to just have someone recommend you to people you thought  might be voters. In addition, we did some television time as well. There  were five candidates. Then I was in a run-off, there were two of us and I  was successful in getting the most votes.  And were you running against males or females?  I was running against males. Oh, actually in the runoff, there was one  other female. Yes.  When you were sworn in as district judge, you did some amazing things  during your almost ten years on the bench. Can we talk a little bit about  how the mental health court came about?  I had been a volunteer with the Mental Health Association for a number  of years. I believe it was because of that association with the Mental  Health Association that I was offered an opportunity to attend the  national judicial course on co-occurring disorders. At that conference, I  met some judges who had established mental health courts in their  jurisdictions. It was such an inspiring thing for the courts to answer what  was such a need in the community for those people who had mental  health issues but got involved in the criminal justice system.  So when I came back from that course, I said,    We need to start one of  these in Oklahoma.    I was fortunate enough to have the cooperation  from the attorney who represented the district attorney   s office and one  from the public defenders office and other people in the community who  knew there were people in the mental health area but got crossed into the  judicial system because of some minor infraction and they needed  treatment and not jail time. So we had a catalyst of people that were  supportive and volunteers. We worked at our lunch hour putting together  the documentation that we needed, collecting forms from other  jurisdictions that had a mental health court and we started one in  Oklahoma County.  And did you see that many states were going down this road or   I  believe Oklahoma was right up there among the first?  There were about seven others in the United States that I was aware of at  that time. It   s my understanding that the one we established in  Oklahoma County was the first one in the southwest. Since that time, in  Oklahoma alone I think there are at least a dozen mental health courts.  9  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Going back to your days on the bench, are there any trials that stand out  in your memory as those    wow    trials that you were involved with?  I think the most memorable were those that I presided over on the  criminal docket. It   s just such an education I think for those of us who  don   t come into contact with the people who are involved in committing  crimes, whether they are assaults or drive-by shootings or murders.  Those cases are most memorable.  We learn the skills we need for our professions in different places. Can  you tell me some of the most important places where you learned the  background you needed for your career?  Well, I   m not sure that anything in particular   I think life experiences in  general help you relate to people in situations. I don   t know of any  particular course that I took. I was pleased that I had as much trial  experience as I had before I took the bench so that I could sympathize  with the lawyers who were there, because I do have real empathy for  them, that they   re representing a client, that they   re on the clock so to  speak, and that we don   t want to waste their time. So it made me be very  cognizant of being on time, starting my court on time, ending on time,  taking breaks at a predictable period, so that the lawyers would not have  additional stress. I don   t know if that made me any better as a judge, but  I just was very aware of that.  We touched upon it a little bit with your early law school experience, but  tell me about any stumbling blocks or adversity that you faced along the  way.  I just think it was difficult being a woman at that time and going into  what was traditionally a man   s field. When I started law school, I think  some of the fellows wondered why I was there and suspected I was there  to find a lawyer husband. I heard comments like,    Don   t you feel guilty  being here taking up the space of a young man that might need to have a  career to support his family?    I think at first they didn   t take me  seriously. I was very serious about it. I was not there for any fun and  games. It was pretty challenging and I needed to put my head down and  do the best that I could so that I could graduate. I also was looking  forward to having a career and supporting my family. I think it is so  common nowadays in law schools that at least half the students are  women, so it   s so different now.  Were the instructors accommodating?  I think that they were a little skeptical of my being there. It was just  different for them. I   m not sure they welcomed the change.  10  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Did you tend to sit in the front of the class or towards the back of the  class?  I tried to sit in the middle and be invisible if I could be. It was traditional  in most criminal law classes that if there was a woman in the class, you  would be called upon to brief, stand up and report on the rape case that  was the first one in your book. So there was I think additional limelight  on you when you didn   t really welcome it. But it was okay. I made it  through.  There was some difficulty, like I mentioned, in hiring a woman lawyer  at that time. And I can remember one time being interviewed at a law  firm and after the interview was over, the senior partner said,    Well  sweetie, if it was up to me, I   d hire you in a minute. But who would you  go to lunch with?    And I thought a minute and I thought, is this a trick  question and if you don   t know the answer you repeat the question? And  I said,    Let   s see, who would I go to lunch with?    He said,    Well you  couldn   t go with the secretaries because you   re a lawyer, and you  couldn   t go with us lawyers because our wives wouldn   t like it.    And  there were a few of those kinds of unfortunate experiences.  Were you happy as a law clerk and not as a lawyer?  Oh yes. Being a law clerk for a federal judge was a wonderful  opportunity to start my legal career. I thought I was very fortunate. I  worked for a couple of good judges and gained the experience behind  the scenes of knowing what a federal judge does with respect to trials  and briefs and helping the judge draft the orders in cases. It was a good  experience.  We   ve talked about adversity, let   s talk about highlights. Tell me a  couple of those key moments in your career that you consider some of  your biggest highlights.  Of course if you are trying a case for your company and representing a  corporation which was always a target, if you were successful in a  lawsuit, those are memorable. I had a couple of those that I thought were  significant cases. And at that time when we were a one Bell system and  it covered the whole United States, your company policy had to be  established at the headquarters and then carried out in each of the states.  So occasionally if I were doing a labor arbitration case or something  similar where company policy was involved, you had to make sure that  you were speaking the same public policy in one state that you were in  another so that you were consistent with how you enforced the benefit  plan, for example.  11  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Occasionally you had an opportunity to win a big case that went all the  way up to AT T headquarters. I remember getting a letter back from the  general attorney congratulating me on an arbitration case where I was  successful. That   s always kind of a nice thing. The only other highlight I  think when I was on the bench, it was a wonderful opportunity that I had  to help establish the Mental Health Court. So I   d say that was my most  significant highlight as a judge.  Well I   m sure it definitely changed a lot of lives and kept a lot of people  out of the system and got them much needed help that they needed.  I think it did.  Let   s turn now to the Oklahoma Woman   s Hall of Fame. And I must say,  I have your Hall of Fame file sitting in my office and it had the most  touching letter from your daughter. Just really touching. When you were  notified that you were going to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, what  was going through your mind at that time?  I don   t recall anything other than being quite happy to be selected and  the fact that I could do it as a partner with my daughter was very special.  And did you attend the ceremony that year?  I did, and she attended as well.  Back in 2005, I   m pretty sure they had presenters; do you remember  who presented you at the ceremony?  I think my daughter did.  So tell me what this type of honor means to you.  I just think that it   s a wonderful experience to be included with some of  those women who have done wonderful things in their lives. It is a quite  moving experience to see the other women who are inducted and to hear  the presentations made. And I was just delighted to be a part of it.  And your daughter went on to become a lawyer?  She has been a lawyer, yes. She was a lawyer at that time as well.  Reading that letter, for me it was touching because she really looked at  you as a big role model in her life. How do you feel that now people look  at you as that role model?  12  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  I think that maybe I was at one time   only because I was one of the first  women in law school. Although there had been women for several years,  it was still unusual at that time. So if I was any kind of a role model, it  was because of the fact that there just were not that many women in the  legal profession.  Would you like to make mention of anybody who has helped play an  important role in your life?  I think I am just grateful for my parents and how they gave me an  opportunity growing up that I was kind of a typical middle class without  some of the traumas that a lot of people face. I think I appreciate that  more now that I   m older.  Were they very encouraging with your education?  I would say that they were not discouraging. It was not   I think I sort of  outran them in my aspirations.  What would be your advice to women who plan on following in your  footsteps?  I think that would be very presumptuous of me to think that I could give  advice to any of these young women who are entering the legal  profession because they are so accomplished now and so sharp, and so  highly skilled technically that I don   t think I would have any advice to  give. They could probably give me advice.  You   ve been very involved in the Oklahoma Bar Association, holding  many posts throughout the years. How has that played a role in your life  as a lawyer and later as a judge?  Well I just think that if you   re in any profession that there is something  that you need to give back. And my representations of leadership on the  boards of the Oklahoma Federal Bar Association or the Oklahoma Bar  Foundation were my efforts to make a contribution to my profession, to  strengthen it if I could.  And you   ve always been pretty involved in the community as well.  Yes, I have been. I   ve enjoyed that. It   s a way of not just being a lawyer,  but reaching out and experiencing other people and what they were  involved in in the community.  What are some of the groups you   re involved with?  13  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Nykolaiszyn  Coats-Ashley  Well currently I   m on the board of the Oklahoma City Community  Foundation which gives a lot of help through scholarships and different  community projects or donations from people, annuities that they  establish at the community foundation. In addition, I   m active in a book  club. I like reading a lot and it keeps me in touch with people who read  things that I would not normally read and they recommend books that  keep me involved in areas that are very stimulating. My husband and I  are active in our church. We also, he and I, tutor at a middle school here  in Oklahoma City and I find that challenging.  So you   re staying pretty busy in retirement?  It   s a nice pace, it is. It   s nice to not have to work through your lunch  hour and read briefs and be confronted with lawyers who are there. I  loved being on the bench for the ten years that I was there, but I also  appreciate being retired.  I know you   re a transplant Oklahoman, what does Oklahoma mean to  you?  Well it   s home. I appreciate the size of Oklahoma City and the size of  the state. I think especially at this time when so many states are  economically challenged, I appreciate the fact that Oklahoma seems to  have control over its budget. It has the rainy day fund for emergencies.  Although we   re not a wealthy state, we seem to be a state that offers a  lot to the people who live here and the quality of life that they have.  When history is written about you, because one day it may be, what  would you like for it to say?  I just find that difficult to believe, so I don   t know what. I guess I would  like for it to say that I was responsible, honorable, and sort of a pioneer  in my profession. I don   t know if that   s any sense of accomplishment,  but it   s been a good life for me and I   ve enjoyed it.  Well is there anything you   d like to say that I have not touched upon  today? Anything you   d like to add?  No, I don   t believe so. You seem to have covered quite a bit.  Well we do appreciate your time today. Thank you very much.  Well Juliana, thank you.  -------  -------
