 Lemons  Kite  Embry  Kite  Embry  Kite  Embry  Ford  Cutter  Etling  Kite  Etling  Usually we like to call these meetings to order by having everyone go around  and say your first name, maiden name, and married name, when you were  born, and where you were born. Then we go around the circle and get into the  real questions.  I guess that I should go first and say that it   s May 30, 2001, and we are in  Boise City, Oklahoma at the Cimarron Heritage Center.  Now we know on the tape where we are. Well, if you want to start, that would  be great.  I   m Eunice Hathaway Embry, and I was born in 1921 on March 24. That  makes me eighty years old.  And where were you born?  Campo, Colorado, eleven miles southwest of Campo.  Oh, so that would be close to Oklahoma, right?  Uh-huh.  I   m Ruth Ford. I was born in Baca County, Colorado, just over the line, in  1922.  I   m Mary Ione French Cutter, and I was born November 5, 1929, and I was  born in Boise City.  I   m Helen Powell Etling. I was born February 4, 1924, and I was born in  Prosper, Texas.  Where is Prosper?  It   s about twenty miles north of Dallas. Now a days, it   s right out of Flower  Mound, I think.  5  Kite  Ford  Embry  Kite  Embry  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Embry  Etling  Kite  Embry  Etling  Cutter  Kite  Etling  Kite  All right. Did all of you grow up in a rural area or was it more urban for  some of you, or maybe a farm upbringing?  Mine was a farm ranch.  Well, it was a little farm where I was born, eleven miles southwest of Campo.  When I was five years old, we moved to Boise City, and I   ve been here ever  since.  Did you move into town?  Uh-huh.  I was kind of born in the kind of urban/farm. Right out south of our hospital  here, there   s a road that goes by, and that   s where the city begins and the  farming starts, so I was born on the farm side.  So you could walk over to the city side.  Yeah, oh yeah. I walked to school all the time.  Didn   t we all?  I left Prosper, Texas when I was small. My dad played baseball, and the  depression came along, and he   d got an offer to come here and pitch for Boise  City and a job, so in 1929 we moved to Boise City from Dallas, Texas.  Wow   What a change, huh.  At first, they had moved to New Mexico and were over there about six months.  Back in those days, baseball was a big thing. He was a baseball pitcher.  Every little town had a baseball team, and they   d hire him, and we traveled  around. It was about time for me to go to school, and we had to stop. There  was a man here named Mr. R. A. Godown, who had a store. He was also the  baseball manager of Boise City. He came to Wellington, Texas, where we  were playing, and told Dad that if he   d come up here he   d give him a job, so  we came. That   s my story.  Best move you ever made.  I think you win the prize for the most unusual reason for being in Boise City  that I   ve ever heard  laughter .  Then he played baseball here for Kenton and all around for years, but he  worked for Roy Godown for twenty. He did a lot of things for him.  Well, what would you say   and we have a variety of life styles here: farm and  6  Embry  Kite  Embry  Kite  Embry  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Embry  Ford  Embry  Ford  Cutter  Kite  Embry  Kite  Ford  ranch, city/farm   .  Well, they tell me you can take the girl out of the country but you can   t take  the country out of the girl.  What would a typical day be like for you as a small child growing up here in  Boise City? What would a normal day be like for you as a young child in  town?  Oh heavens, just going to school and going home and just doing whatever, I  guess. It was just a small place. There really wasn   t much to do.  Well, what did your father do?  My father was a carpenter, and his father was a carpenter, and he had five  brothers, and they were all carpenters.  Good ones, too.  They came from Wichita, Kansas, and my dad   s father came from New York.  When my father was a small child, he lived in    Well the fact is that he was  born in Adrian, Michigan. He used to ice skate across the corner of Lake  Michigan in the winter to get to his job across it, so he wouldn   t have to walk  all the way around. He   d ice skate across.  How neat.  He built his first house when he was sixteen. Can you see a kid sixteen now  building a house?  I   d like to see a lot of them  laughter .  I would like to, right.  I think that   d be a good experience for them.  Oh, I think it   s great.  So, as a child here, you didn   t have chores to do or a job you were expected to  do?  No, no. We just lived in town. Well, we did have an old cow out there, and  Dad had him a chicken or two, but that was about the size of it. I guess you  just grew up. What more do you say?  I bet daily life on a farm is a little bit different, on the farm ranch.  Sure. As soon as you get home the two and a half miles from school, walking  most of the time, in good weather, you had all this work to do. I was the oldest  7  Cutter  Ford  Embry  Kite  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Embry  Ford  Kite  Ford  Kite  Ford  Kite  Cutter  girl, so I got most of it  laughter .  That   s bad.  Of course, they might tell a different story.  Well, there were seven in my family.  Wow   Where did you fit in?  I was about the  middlest.   That   s why you didn   t have to do too much.  Oh, I learned to wash dishes. I had an argument with my sister just younger  than I am once in a while, because I wanted to dry the dishes one day, and she  wouldn   t let me. So we had a row Dad said,    Eunice, behave yourself,    so I  decided that I was going to get even. I got more water in the rinse water than I  had in the dishwater  laughter . That   s some of the things we did when we  were kids.  I was the second child down, and I always had to go out and help get the cow   s  milk and feed; this was my brother and I. Then we   d milk the cows and so on  and take the milk and separate it. I don   t know if you know what a separator  is.  Oh yeah.  Then when we got that done, mother would have breakfast. We   d eat  breakfast, and then we   d find that gallon syrup bucket and put our lunch  together and head off for school two and a half miles away. At night, some of  my chores were that I had to fill the reservoir on the stove.  To heat the water?  Yeah, on the end of it, when they   d build the fire, it   d heat the water. That was  pretty nice too, because when you wanted to wash your hands or anything, you  could. We didn   t have plumbing in our house even until I was grown up and  gone. I had to carry all that water in and take out the ashes, and then go out  and chop wood, and get the wood in for mother to have the next day, and carry  the coal in, and things like that. Because I was the oldest girl, my brother was  working in the field and things. I never thought much about it. That was just  how you had to do, so you did it.  What about you two?  Well, I remember getting up fairly early, because we always did, and we  8  Embry  Cutter  Ford  Etling  Cutter  Embry  Ford  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Ford  always had oatmeal for breakfast and eggs and bacon. If it was school time, I  had to get ready for school, and I walked to school. I don   t remember what I  did for food. They didn   t have a cafeteria then, so I must have taken my lunch.  It didn   t impress me very much, whatever I ate.  Well, I walked home for lunch.  Well maybe I did too.  How far were you from the school?  About everybody walked.  About a mile.  We walked home, because we lived up there by it.  I would have lost half a day if I   d walked home from mine  laughter .  Then we had animals, and I remember my little sister and I would go and get  the cows out in the pasture and bring them in. That gave us some time away  from the house, where we didn   t have to do the chores in the house like  dusting or whatever. It was a pretty carefree life there for a while, until I grew  a little older. Of course, your responsibilities increase as you get older, and  that was fine with me. I remember I believe we did go home for lunch. We  had a little hamburger shack that was run by this woman. When we got to go  over there and eat hamburger, we just loved it.  Mrs. Skaggs.  Mrs. Skaggs. It was a little thing that you couldn   t have very many people in it  at once.  It cost you a nickel for a hamburger.  A nickel for a hamburger. Not very many of you could go in, because if you  did, you   d set off the leverage on the trailer, and it would get kind of lopsided.  It was pretty precarious, I   ll tell you.  But she put out a good hamburger.  Oh my, either that or I was awful darn hungry; I don   t know.  Well, it tasted good to us. Of course, it didn   t take very much to make a kid  happy.  No, not really.  Some of them.  9  Cutter  Etling  Embry  Etling  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Etling  Kite  But I know I had to get home right after school, because if I dilly-dallied and  went up by town and came home, I was in deep trouble.  Well, my life was quite a bit different, because I was an only child. I really  didn   t have to do very much, to be real honest with you. I was more like my  dad. He tried to get me to play golf, and I played a lot of baseball. I did all the  things my dad wanted me to, so I wasn   t very good around the house. I never  did much in the house. I was just always with my dad doing things. During  those years, Dad had a pretty good job with Mr. Godown, and then he did  other jobs. I really don   t remember that we had many problems. Mother  bartered a lot. She did a lady   s hair. She   d do the ironing for the lady to do  her hair. Then she did the ironing for Mrs. Butterball here in town, who ran  the paper, and that got our newspaper. She did the ironing for her. So, there  was a lot of bartering that went on like that. I don   t remember too many hard  times, other than like Eunice said. And Eunice and I didn   t live too far apart.  No, a couple of three blocks.  We   d walk to school and walk back.  How often would you get to go over to the hamburger shack? Did you ever  make it over there to the hamburger shack?  No, she didn   t go to school here.  I didn   t go here. I went to Colorado. I grew up in Colorado.  I got quite a bit of time there.  Well I went, and I got in bad trouble. I got to go after school sometimes, and  Mrs. Skaggs and I seemed to get along real well, and she   d charge it to me.  I   m not sure she didn   t charge a lot of people. I think she had a little roll.  I know my bill got up to five dollars, and I thought my folks were going to kill  me  laughter .  That   s a lot of hamburgers.  She sold candy bars and cokes too. Or pop, not cokes, pop.  That   s fifty.  Her son also worked at the store where my dad did, and finally Mrs. Skaggs  said something to Dad that I was in debt a little bit. I think that taught me  more about being in debt than anything  laughter . I never did do that ever  anymore.  As kids in the area, what did you all do for fun or entertainment?  10  Etling  Cutter  Embry  Etling  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Embry  Ford  Etling  Ford  Cutter  Kite  I went swimming out here at the swimming pool in the summer, all the time.  Then we had a good little theater.  Uh-huh, a real good one; and it had Saturday matinees.  And they had a skating rink. Oh, I loved to skate.  Yeah, portable. A portable skating rink came in every summer.  That was the funniest thing, wasn   t it?  A portable skating rink?  Yeah, they   d just bring the boards, I mean their skating floor, and put a tarp  over it. Sometimes they even had a tent around it.  Kind of a tent.  And it was there, and it was pretty good.  And we   d skate all the time in the summer.  I never did learn how to skate well, but I loved to try.  But that skating rink came in every summer and set up down there kind of  west of town there, and it always was there.  We had a drug store that had a fountain chute. We   d always go there. We   d  go to a matinee Saturday or Sunday.  That was after we got a little older.  When we got older, yeah.  Yeah, you could go to the show for a dime.  Then we   d go and get ice cream at the drug store.  Well, we used to get a coke and a candy bar, a Milky Way.  Was the drugstore over here where Jack Pick used to have it?  That   s where it was, Hall   s Drugstore.  I remember it from when I first came to Boise City.  It   s where the Keyes bank is now.  You were saying you remember when what?  11  Ford  Etling  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Etling  Embry  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Embry  Etling  Embry  Etling  Well, I haven   t lived here that long. I   ve been here just about ten years. I  don   t know very many people either.  That drugstore was there, wasn   t it? That Hall   s Drugstore.  I think it wasn   t there when I moved here, but it was when I bought the house  here. Jack Pick was not running it anymore.  No, he was gone.  His health kind of failed him.  It   s real funny; I was telling you about this road that goes in front of our house.  Well, the city girls wanted to come out on Sunday afternoon after church to  my house to play. I always wanted to go into town to play, so that was kind of  a social thing on Sundays that we did. I had two or three friends that lived on  the same street, and we   d take turns.  Take turns.  Oh, they thought coming out to the country was fun. I had animals and pets  and a horse, and they thought that was living, but I really enjoyed the city life  when I could get it.  We really used to have more entertainment for kids than we do now.  Yeah.  As I say, we had the swimming pool out here and everybody went swimming.  It was a real nice pool.  Out in the country.  Then, that portable skating rink came in every summer, and we had a real nice  theater. We had lots of church activities.  Lots of church.  The swimming pool you   re talking about, is it the one that   s here now?  Showalters.  Showalters.  Out in the country. You walked a mile or so out to Showalters to go  swimming. You could go swimming for a dime too. My dad was quite a card,  and I   d ask him or dime so I could go swimming, and he   d say,    Well, I only  have a nickel today. You can decide if you want to put your head in or your  feet, because that   s all I   ve got.     Laughter  He   d do me that way on the show  12  Ford  Kite  Ford  Kite  Ford  Etling  Embry  Ford  Kite  Ford  Kite  Ford  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Ford  too. I   d say,    Dad, I   d like to have a dime to go to the show.       Well, I   ve got  a nickel. Do you want to see the first half or the last half?     Laughter   That   s funny.  How was life in Colorado as a young child? What would you do for fun there?  Oh, we never lacked for fun. We had to work pretty hard too. We all knew  what our jobs were and that we   d better do them. We never thought anything  about it; we just did them. Fun, well, I got up as early as I could to get the  cows milked and get to school so we could play. We   d get some pretty good  playing in before the bell rang. Then the teacher would come out and shake  that bell. We had to line up and get in there and go to work.  Anything in particular that you would look forward to at school to play?  Oh, lots of things, yeah  The camaraderie was nice too, because when you live  out in the country and you   re not used to having people around you all the time  except your family, it   s fun.  Down here in the Griggs community and out in there, they used to have what  they call Saturday night country parties at different houses.  Yeah.  They used to have Saturday night dances up our way, and my dad and my  brother played for them too.  What   d they play?  The violin and piano. My brother would cord on the piano, sometimes some  of them would play the guitar, and Daddy would play the violin.  Did they get paid for playing?  They   d pass a hat. If they got five dollars, that was quite a bit. That was when  money was hard to come by, but it was entertainment. They had it in the  school. We had these one-room schools. I was thinking the other day about  how that teacher taught all of us. But you know, I never had to take any  dummy courses when I went to college.  They   re called remedial   Laughter   No, they called them dumbos in Minnesota where I went   Laughter  You  had to take a test.  To get entry, like they do now.  Yeah, but there were some things that I hadn   t taken, coming up through the  13  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Ford  Embry  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Embry  Etling  Embry  Cutter  Etling  line, so I had to take these tests, but they never made me take any over or do  anything about it. If you had to do that, you had to go to school and pay for it,  but you didn   t get any credit. I didn   t have to do that.  So are there any other things for fun or games you played?  Oh yeah, we played lots of games. The minute we could get out of that  schoolhouse we played games.  They used to play Blind Man   s Bluff.  We did a lot of Hopscotch.  And then you tag. They   d drop the hanky behind you, and you   d run and try to  get them before they got your place.  When it   d snow, we   d play fox and goose. We   d make a circle and make it  kind of like a wagon wheel, and then whoever got pushed into the thing and  had to be the fox, he had to stand in the center. Then we   d all run around that  circle, but we had a home base. You had to run around him and try to get back  to your home before he tagged you. If he tagged you, you had to go stand in  the middle and help do that too. It was a lot more fun to not get caught. That  was what we did when it snowed a lot.  Well, in the wintertime when I was a kid, there was about a block between the  next house and us, and we had all of this space in here, and we had a big old  circle drive. When it would get icy, we would play kick the can and run. I had  a lot of fun on this ice, and got a lot of bumps too.  You kick the can and then what?  You run.  You run, and they try to catch you?  Yeah, yeah.  And in the winter, we   d go sled riding. Everybody would have a kind of sled.  Oh yeah, I remember my dad taking me sleigh riding after I was grown.  We   d always fix the playhouse, and then we   d have a lot of fun. We   d  imagine our roles; some of us were movie stars. Whoever the movie star was  of that day, we would be that and the others would be somebody else, and  we   d have roles. Everybody would have a role to play. And we   d play house  and play with our mother   s old things, the dresses and the hats and the shoes.  I really do think we had more fun than we do now.  14  Embry  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Embry  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Etling  Well, I don   t think we were ever hurting, even though you didn   t have any  money to spend.  Oh no. I was never bored.  We didn   t feel like we were being slighted because nobody else had any either.  You didn   t know the difference.  That   s what I said a while ago. I guess we were poor, but we really never felt  that way.  I never felt poor.  Because everybody was the same.  Especially after the dust bowl and all of that.  It wasn   t like living today.  When a farmer didn   t make a crop, it just dominoed down. The merchants in  town had to carry him, and there was no work for people; no one was building.  Do you remember any time in particular when you realized things weren   t  going as well for your parents as they had been? Do you remember when you  didn   t get a dime to go to the show, and when things started to kind of pear  down?  My dad always planted a few rows of beans and corn and stuff so we could can  them. I remember sitting out there shucking that corn one morning, and the  mailman came and he brought a flier, and it had some shoes in it. Daddy and  mother talked quite a while about whether he ought to order some shoes,  because the soles of his shoes were worn out. He had resoled the shoes again,  but those shoes had just gotten to where there wasn   t much left to resole, and  they cost two dollars. I remember mama and daddy sitting there discussing  whether they should get those shoes or not, or whether daddy could get along a  little while longer until they could get some more money. I realized that we  didn   t have much money, but we never were hungry, because we raised stuff.  Before daddy got home mother would say,    Now kids, you better get your  work done, because your daddy   s awfully blue.    Blue, down.    He   s awfully  blue, so you better get your work done so things are okay when he gets home.     I think she was just trying to get us to get our work done.  One of the memories I remember was that my grandparents lived over here at  Sedan, New Mexico, which is just south of Clayton, New Mexico, and my dad  came from a big family. There were thirteen children in the whole family. I  have two aunts and an uncle younger than me. I was at the farm that day when  they came out to shoot the cattle that they couldn   t feed and the government  15  Embry  Etling  Ford  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Ford  said we had to take them. They would not let them eat them either. There  were nine children. We couldn   t eat them, and they just loaded them up and  hauled them off. That   s one of the most vivid memories I have of the dust  bowl days, because I was there that day.  I remember us kids coming home for lunch one day, and mother had gone to  Liberal, Kansas to see her sister who was in the hospital. My dad proceeded to  cook some green beans for lunch. He put them in a big pot like so, and he put  those on the stove to cook. Of course, that was a kerosene stove. The rest of  us were at school, and when I went home at noon, those green beans had  burned plum down to here. I don   t remember what we had for lunch that day,  but I remember my dad putting those green beans on to cook, and they were  burned plum to the bottom. I don   t remember even cleaning the old black pan.  I remember going over there when they raised pinto beans, because over in  that country they did. You put them in this building. Of course, I was just the  fair-headed child, because I was the only grandchild. You   d tromp on these  beans to shell them. We little kids would get out then and tromp on the beans  and that would shell them.  The next step was to wait until a windy day, and hold the beans up like that  and pour them down into the washtub, and that would get the hulls and shells  out of them.  I remember what you call that, gleaning?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The shell would blow away in the wind. You were going to say something  earlier; do you remember what you were going to say?  No, but maybe I   ll think of it.  We generally ate what we grew, and we had milk and we had eggs. The extra  cream and eggs, my mother took to town, and then she   d trade them for  groceries. There wasn   t any fooling around with a lot of this prepared food,  but we had good basic food. I love macaroni and cheese, and we had that a lot,  but just basic good food.  You were talking about the cows being shot and then you were going to say  something.  Up in Colorado, they shot the cows and let them take the meat.  Oh, they did let people take the meat.  Yeah.  16  Etling  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Embry  Ford  Embry  Kite  Embry  Cutter  Etling  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Etling  Ford  Cutter  Etling  Ford  Kite  They didn   t over in New Mexico.  I remember daddy going down there. He brought us quite a bit of meat, I   m  not sure how much, and brought it home, and boy, we went to work and  canned it.  Canned meat at that time, yeah.  We had a cellar and got it all canned, and it was pretty good in the wintertime.  It still is, if you had some.  Did they make jerky or dry any of the meat?  No, but they made a lot of sausage and hamburger.  Head cheese.  I like headcheese too.  Oh, I don   t.  Is there anything you wouldn   t eat? It seems like people from your generation  would eat anything and everything.  You didn   t have much of a variety like they do now.  You didn   t have to beg a child to clean off its plate like you would now. I  don   t like that or I don   t like this, it just didn   t happen.  They used just about everything they could use.  I   ve never had scrambled eggs and brains.  I haven   t either; I never ate them.  I wouldn   t say you miss too much  laughter .  I know dad butchered.  It wasn   t a delicacy, let met tell you.  They had the calf fry.  Well, Dad butchered for Roy, and the meat market there.  Would you like to tell him what calf fries are?  Oh, I   ve had calf fries  laughter .  17  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Kite  Etling  Kite  Ford  Etling  Cutter  Embry  Etling  Embry  Ford  Embry  Cutter  Fowler  Etling  Now that is one thing I   ve never eaten.  They   re good.  I know they are, if you don   t know what they are, I guess, the first time. I  understand they are really good if they   re cooked well.  I think it   s just like with you. I don   t really know what to do, but the Spanish  people really know what to do with tripe and use it all the time.  Pig   s feet?  It   s the stomach lining.  But I   ve never eaten it.  They make soup with it, minudo.  And they also make dressing and put in this paunch, the belly, they clean it.  Then they put dressing in it; that   s what the butcher told me. It kind of  flavored it up real good, and he said it was good.  It is.  We made sausages and used the intestines. They   d scrape them and clean  them really well, and then stuff them.  Yeah, and they   d strip off this fat off of these entrails.  Liver and onions is one of my favorite foods. None of my family will eat it. I  have two children, and they never would eat it, but I loved it. And I liked  scrambled eggs and brains, but my mother could really cook that up. I don   t  know how she did it. You   d never know.  And they used to hang their meat in what they called the smokehouse. You   d  hang it, and then you   d just go out and cut off whatever you wanted for this  meal. You   d bring it in and cook it, especially in the wintertime.  A lot of times, that smokehouse business kind of came by when they butchered  hogs, and they   d put that brown sugar on the hams and stuff.  Salt.  This is my brother-in-law. This is Millard Fowler and his son Gary.  Well, this is a good place to find out  about the dust bowl .  Well, I don   t know if he   s finding out too much, because we told him we were  all poor, but none of us realized we were  laughter .  18  Kite  Etling  Cutter  Fowler  Etling  Ford  Embry  Ford  Embry  Cutter  Ford  Embry  Ford  Etling  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Etling  Embry  That   s the best way to be poor.  We just grew up that way.  That   s right. There   s no peer pressure.  We found out we got poor though.  Yeah we did, but as kids, you didn   t think much about it.  Well, nobody else had money either.  You didn   t dwell on it.  But we had enough stuff to get some games going every morning wherever we  were. We didn   t think anything about it. We just went out and had a good old  ball game, and pretty soon daddy would get out there and honk the horn, and  we   d better come running and jump in the car and go home.  And then after we got to be in high school, we had an awful good basketball  team.  Yeah, you were one of the better, the best players. Tall old Sally there dunked  her in.  Wasn   t she a forward?  Yeah.  I went to Elkhart one day, and I hadn   t been over there for years, and this one  gal came up to me and said,    I never will forget you.    I looked at her, and I  said,    Huh-uh.    She was the forward on the basketball team, and Larry  Miller   s sister, Margie, and I were guards. We   d up and do this in her face.  She   d turn her nose up, and I knew she could just kill us, but she didn   t get  around to it. That   s what she said; she said,    Boy, I hated you that night.     Isn   t that funny  laughter ?  I think that   s how I got in trouble one time too with the hamburger, going over  there getting something to eat after basketball practice.  Sports were a big thing in the community.  Were you all on teams?  Well I played in the grades a little bit. We just played.  Eunice and I played.  You were a cheerleader.  19  Etling  Embry  Etling  Cutter  Lemons  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Embry  Etling  Embry  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Kite  Ford  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Fowler  Cutter  Fowler  I was a basketball player. Eunice and I did when we were about in the seventh  grade, didn   t we?  Yeah, yeah.  We had a team.  I don   t know how these girls    fathers felt about it, but my daddy wouldn   t go  to a ball game to see me play, because he didn   t think I should be wearing  shorts in public  laughter . I mean, you know, modesty. It came into it, so he  never came to see me play.  Now I saw some basketball pictures of there. Were you wearing the bloomer  shorts or the short shorts?  Ours were short.  I was surprised by how short they were.  Yeah, now the way the girls wear them, they   re real sloppy, I think.  I think they   re real gaudy.  So are the boys.  Yeah, oh yeah.  But they cover up more now than they did when you guys were playing. You  guys were pretty risqu  .  Yeah, we were pretty risqu  .  Well, not our team. It was about down to our knees.  That   s about how it is today.  I remember our suits were navy blue with red trim.  We   ve got the mechanics wandering over here again.  He   d probably tell you a lot.  He wasn   t a girl then. He would have some stories though.  Did you ever figure out why we had a dirt storm?  Because people started getting all the land loosened up with plows and things.  World War I was the first war that was fought with machinery. Any time  20  Cutter  Fowler  Embry  Fowler  Etling  Embry  Etling  Fowler  Cutter  Fowler  Ford  Fowler  Ford  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Kite  before that, they did it with horses or on foot. After World War I, we had  tractors to plow with instead of horses. The tractor would run day and night if  you had somebody to ride it, where horses you had to take in and feed and let  them rest. After World War I, everybody wanted more food over the world,  more wheat, so we started plowing this darn country up.  Plowing from fence to fence.  Whether it was fit land or not. Then we raised a big crop or two and made  some money. And then it wasn   t worth anything. So the farmers walked off  and let the land blow away.  Wasn   t wheat thirty-five cents a bushel?  Two bits a bushel.  I   ve got my dad   s. When he first came down here from Kansas, I   ve got a  dollar bill framed that he got for some wheat. I   ve forgotten what year that  would have been, but it was about twenty-five cents up until then, and he  finally got a dollar once.  A bushel.  A bushel, and he framed it.  We burned ears of corn in the stove in the wintertime.  It was cheaper fuel.  It was a lot cheaper than coal.  You had to have your coal hauled in.  We got coal from Rattan. It was shipped in or whatever, and it was cheaper.  Of course, we burnt cow chips and corn combs.  Did you ever hear that?  Cow chips, yeah.  Yeah, and they were good fuel.  They   re hot, and make a lot of ashes, though, because I had to carry all those  buckets back. I   d go out and help pick them up. They burned fast. Boy, they  really got hot.  What about other government programs? We talked about killing the cattle  because they couldn   t be fed.  21  Etling  Ford  Cutter  Fowler  Kite  Fowler  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Etling  Embry  Kite  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Ford  Etling  Well, you had the WPA government program.  There are still things around throughout the country that the WPA built.  Like your buildings and things.  We   ve got a two-holer out here in the backyard that was built by the WPA.  We heard about their program coming around building outhouses. They  sound like pretty quality jobs.  We get one of them out there.  I   ll go check that out. Is it useable? I   ve got to go  laughter .  We   ve probably got a modern one in here.  Oklahoma used to get all the flack for being the dust bowl, or the panhandle  more or less. Well, it wasn   t just us. It was Colorado, Kansas, all around,  wherever there was farmland. If it was grassland, they didn   t have it.  Really, the panhandle of Oklahoma, that   s where Mrs. Ford was born, that was  really.  Baca County, Colorado.  That   s the bull   s-eye of the dust bowl.  That   s when the first one I ever saw was coming from the north.  How did your parents and friends feel about the    New Deal    programs, the  WPA and the CCC?  I don   t know.  I think it was probably the way my parents thought about it. It was probably a  good thing at the time.  It put people to work.  It put people to work and helped people that had no family.  It put some money in their pocket.  But, it was like anything else the government does; it just got out of hand. I  can remember when the banks closed, when we came here in    29. We were  talking about that a while ago. My dad always said that you would probably  never have a depression and a drought at the same time. See, the stock market  fell in    29 and we had it then, see. That would probably never happen again.  22  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Embry  Ford  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Embry  Kite  Embry  Kite  Embry  Cutter  Ford  Embry  Of course, he   s been dead for a long time, and it could happen again, but that  was one of the things that he said happened to us, our stock market fell.  Oh yeah. We had trouble with our bank here, because the banker was really  good and put out too much money.  Too many loans they couldn   t pay back.  Finally, I think he had to go to prison over it.  Do you remember friends or neighbors that had to rely on government support  to make it through?  Oh, yes.  Almost everybody.  We didn   t, but afterwards Mom said that we might as well have gone ahead  and signed up, because Daddy was not going to take hand outs. Mom said we  should have taken it, because we were going to have to help pay it back.  They   d get big rolls of cheese, big, round, pretty, yellow cheese, and grape  fruit and oranges, and lots of things like that. We didn   t have much of it,  because we couldn   t afford it. I don   t think there were very many people up  there in Beckham County that weren   t on the WPA, and the men worked on  the roads. That   s the main thing they did up there.  What was the other? The CCC was a core.  It was for younger men.  And they wore uniforms like the army, and they went out and built lodges and  state parks. They did a lot of that. Every once in a while, you   ll see a little  place where they have it written on there,    Built by the CCC.     Raymond, he was in the CCC.  Who   s Raymond?  That   s my youngest brother.  Were you around when he went off to work for them?  Well, that was down at Ft. Sill, was where he had to go. No.  It was kind of like an army situation.  Yeah, it really was.  I don   t remember how long he was in it.  23  Etling  Kite  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Embry  Ford  Cutter  Kite  Ford  There was quite a bit of CCC work going on over around Clayton I remember,  more so than here, because I remember dad had two brothers that worked in  the CCC over there.  Boiling Springs has a lot of CCC work over there.  The big rocks that they could get from the area and whatever they could build  with it, they built with it.  It was pretty nice. Did you have any friends or family that just took off and  left?  Oh, lots of neighbors left.  You mean to California?  Wherever.  Well, they went west.  Have you see The Grapes of Wrath?  Yeah.  Okay, that   s what it looked like too, didn   t it?  What?  The Grapes of Wrath.  Well yeah, it was very difficult.  They wrote a book called The Grapes of Wrath.  They made a movie too.  John Steinbeck got kind of a black eye over that one.  Let me hear about your story.  Well, I   m an ex-teacher, and we had a library of films up at administration, so  I ordered The Grapes of Wrath. I knew it wasn   t The Grapes of Wrath like the  real film was. I knew it was doctored, but the print had come through and the  principal saw it. He came running down there and asked me if I was the one  who ordered The Grapes of Wrath, and I told him yeah. He said,    Well, you  better send that back.    I said,    Well, it isn   t what you think.    He didn   t  believe me; he took it home that weekend and watched it. He brought it back  and said,    Oh, that   s not bad at all.    It showed the people working and having  to get rid of everything and crying and how they didn   t have any place to go.  24  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Etling  Ford  Etling  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Etling  Embry  Cutter  Etling  Some went to Chicago, and a whole family lived in one room, and all of them  went out everyday and tried to find enough food and work, and that   s what that  was.  It wasn   t the Henry Fonda version?  No, I wouldn   t show that.  A lot of people from this area did go to California, and they never came back.  That was their home from then on.  A lot of them in Beckham County did come back.  Did they?  Oh yeah. I can remember them and seeing their cars as they were getting  ready to go. They   d have all the tires they could fit tied on the back end of  them, and they   d take off for California.  I don   t remember seeing them leave.  They had just what they could get in the car and their family and a little bit of  food. There wasn   t much, I don   t think.  I don   t remember too much about seeing them leave.  Did you stay in touch with the people that left? Did you write letters?  Well, one of my great uncles, he went out there, and he kept telling us about  how beautiful it was, the land of milk and honey. He was kind of a thorn in  our side, actually.  You felt like he was kind of teasing you?  Yeah. We weren   t real happy about that part.  What made you guys all stay if a lot of your friends were leaving?  Our folks were just tenacious.  They wouldn   t give up.  I don   t suppose we had the money to leave.  That   s right   Well you could leave everything you had.  Well, Dad had a job and that seemed to be all that was important.  25  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Kite  Ford  Etling  Cutter  Embry  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Kite  Embry  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Ford  Cutter  Fowler  Cutter  Embry  I still think that   s what made the people that stayed here stronger because they  finally got above that.  You mean we got enough to have a full meal on the table.  Yeah, I guess but I mean they wanted to keep their land and they just had to  hold on to it.  It   s a sense of pride now.  But we had a hard time keeping it with the way the wind blew.  When was the first time you remember the wind blowing?  Holy cow, it was about    28, wasn   t it? Well, it   s always blown. If it didn   t  blow, we wouldn   t think we were in the panhandle  laughter .  About the thirties is when it started to blow.  We   ve always had a southerly southwest wind, but this came from the north.  That was about    35 then.  But I think the dust bowl started around thirty.  I think so too. How come I remember, and I wasn   t born until    29?  I don   t care; I think that   s about right, because we came here in    29.  I bet you two or three year olds remember then.  I remember I was home with my sister, and they   d had a funeral in town.  But it got worse.  There was a grandmother Shaw died and her grandchild.  Now you   re talking about Black Sunday.  That   s when the bad one came.  My mother and father had gone to the funeral and I was home, and I remember  looking out and seeing this low cloud rolling in.  It was like a wall cloud.  Yeah, it was terrible.  If it had been water, it   d just look like it was this big old wave coming  26  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Kite  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Lemons  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Ford  Kite  Cutter  Kite  Lemons  Ford  We had the dustbowl before that.  I know I was so afraid then.  That   s why you don   t remember, because I was in    35.  You would have been six.  Yeah probably, when the funeral occurred.  When that big one came. How did a six-year-old react to that?  Well, I was concerned about my parents because they weren   t home, so I kept  looking out the back door. They just got in through the garage with the car,  and ran for the house, and it hit. I felt like we were all there, so it was going to  be okay.  Everybody had gone to that funeral. My parents had.  This is the undertaker   s.  Oh, Shaw.  Shaw, Hazel Shaw from Vici.  We talked to her actually.  She   s in a nursing home in Vici, and it was her child and her mother-in-law  that died.  About everybody in this town had gone. My folks had gone, because I was  home by myself.  She has a son named Chub Shaw, but it was Charles Shaw, her husband, it was  her husband. It was their child and Charles Shaw   s mother that passed away.  Wasn   t there a baby found on the Methodist Church steps?  The coffee box baby, we   ve heard that.  Was that during that bad time?  It wasn   t during    35. It wasn   t during Black Sunday, but it was during the  winter.  Yeah, it was in the winter.  I think that   s what I read.  27  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Fowler  Ford  Embry  Cutter  Etling  Kite  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Kite  Cutter  Ford  You know, that baby stayed around town. They kept it for a while, and then  they sent it somewhere.  Somebody took it.  And then the little thing died. I don   t know what age the child died at, but he  didn   t survive long.  About two-years-old, I think.  Well, how did the drought and the depression and the holy rollers coming  through, how did that change your life? It was a trying time.  It was kind of a gritty time. Everything you tasted taste like dirt. It would  infiltrate the house, so you had to prepare for that.  There was about that much dirt all the time in the windowsills. You could  clean them out, but before you got them cleaned out, it   d blow some more in.  Well, the houses then weren   t sealed up like they are now.  No, they weren   t quite. We had a pretty nice house, and it still got in there. I  think it   d get dirt in a tin can.  We did too.  Well, my folks would talk cotton flannel sheets and douse them in water and  get them wet, wring them out, and put the up at the windows and the doors.  When it was over with you would take it down, and there was just mud on the  other side of it.  Are you asking how that life has affected us today?  I   ll ask that later.  Oh, okay. I was wondering  laughter .  We thought it was kind of fun because when it came in, it went up against the  fences so the cows could come over into the yard and we could go over the  fences. It was fun times in a lot of respects, but it was a terribly serious time.  Oh yeah.  I was just curious about whether your life or your chores or the things you had  to do or couldn   t do were affected by the dirt.  Well, when it blew, we were pretty well inside.  Yeah, and sometimes you had to put a cloth over your nose and your mouth so  28  Cutter  Embry  Ford  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Kite  Ford  Kite  Ford  Kite  Embry  Kite  Embry  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  you wouldn   t breathe so much of that dirt, because when it was really going  and all, it was just kind of like a smog, and not wet; it was dust.  Well, the American Red Cross would send out big bundles of white masks that  had the strings. A lot of people had dust pneumonia too, didn   t they?  Yes.  And died with it.  And now, anyone that came through the dust bowl days, if you   ve ever had a  chest x-ray, it   ll always shows spots.  A spot or two.  They have finally learned that that was just from the dust bowl.  I want to ask you about growing up in Colorado. A lot of times, people we talk  to here tell us stories of hobos or tramps coming through looking for work or  food or both. We also hear gypsies sometimes hit the area, and I wondered if  they ever made it up around Campo.  Well, we lived east of Campo, and we were really out in the country. We lived  on a farm ranch, and they wouldn   t come out there, because that was miles  from Campo.  That was too far out for anybody.  The only thing we had trouble with were coyotes and things like that.  Four-legged coyotes.  Then the Indians came in. They raised broomcorn.  They would harvest the broomcorn, is that what you   re saying?  Uh-huh.  Our house was right up from the railroad, and the hobos would come up there.  My mother would always fix them a fried egg sandwich and a pint jar of  coffee. She always creamed her coffee, so she creamed theirs, and they sat out  on the back step, and we just loved to watch. We just thought that was the  most wonderful thing.  Why would you like to watch hobos eat?  I thought they were neat. I just thought they were another person visiting us. I  wasn   t afraid of them or anything.  29  Ford  Fowler  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Lemons  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Kite  Ford  Kite  Ford  I never heard anything about them ever being mean.  They were never any trouble.  No, they were in bad straits.  You never turned one away. They were always willing to do something  around the house.  Some of them would hop back on the train then.  You know what   s odd is we   ve talked to a lot of ladies and heard quite a few  hobo stories, but I   ve never known a lady that   s ever known a hobo or known  somebody that became a hobo. Isn   t that odd?  I know.  Well tell us.  Okay, you   re going to break the streak.  Well, I never was out on the road with him. All I saw was when he   d come  home. He   d come home maybe once or twice a year, and he just wore a pair  of overalls, and I don   t know what else besides a shirt. He didn   t ever work.  But he would leave when the robins came, wouldn   t he? That   s one of the  things they always said.    I   ll be here to work for you until the robins come,     and when the robins came, he was off.  I don   t remember if he ever worked or not.  Do you remember that story?  Was he just a friend of yours?  Oh, just someone I knew.  You never knew where he went, did you?  No, he wouldn   t even talk about it.  Were you jealous of him just taking off like that?  No, I didn   t think much about it.  What about women hobos? Did you ever encounter any of those?  No.  30  Fowler  Kite  Ford  Kite  Fowler  Kite  Fowler  Kite  Fowler  Kite  Fowler  Cutter  Embry  Fowler  Cutter  Fowler  Cutter  Fowler  Kite  Fowler  Kite  Fowler  Ford  Cutter  I   ve hoboed a little, rode trains and things.  Have you really?  Well, here   s a real one.  Let   s talk to the hobo now.  I didn   t see any women.  We   ve heard mention of women hobos, but we   ve never actually spoken to  anyone that   s ever seen them.  I know how far it is off the top of a boxcar down to the ground  laughter . I   ve  been kicked off a few times.  Did you grow up in this area?  Yeah, pretty much.  And when did you hit the rails the first time?  In    30,    31 maybe.  Which way did you go Millard?  East, I   ll bet you.  Indiana.  Oh, yeah.  I was born in Indiana.  His family was born in Indiana.  I used to hitchhike to Indianapolis or Bloomington.  How old were you in    31?  Well, I don   t know. I was born in 1913.  Eighteen. Did you enjoy it? Was it a good ride out there?  Oh yeah, most of it.  It was an adventure, I imagine.  Did you ever have any trouble with the other hobos?  31  Fowler  Cutter  Fowler  Cutter  Etling  Fowler  Embry  Fowler  Cutter  Ford  Kite  Embry  Ford  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Fowler  Oh no, the only trouble you had was with what we called a yard dig.  Yeah, they   d come after you with a stick.  They   d roust you up and kick you off the train, like at Dodge City or Emporia  or someplace like that.  They said that hobos had a way of keeping a big pot on with a fire under it,  and everybody was welcome as long as they brought a can of food. They just  opened that can, and no matter what it was, it went in there. They   d stir it up,  and everybody ate it.  We had quite a few hobos, more when we were building the railroad through  here.  You could buy a bottle of milk for a nickel and a loaf of bread for a nickel or a  dime, and you could live a couple of days on things.  Now was it hobos or gypsies that big families, maybe two or three families  together, they   d come in a vehicle, or was that the gypsies?  That was the gypsies.  We had gypsies come through our station up there.  Yeah, a gypsy bunch came through, and my dad wasn   t home, and the wagon  was sitting out there, and it wasn   t very old either. They needed a wagon  wheel. They soft talked mom and got her to let them take one of those wheels  off that wagon, and they gave her a gold ring for it. She thought she   d made  quite a deal. When daddy got home, he just had three wheels   Laughter   Three wheels and a ring  laughter .  That ring wouldn   t fit on his wagon, would it?  It didn   t work too well.  The hobos would generally go straight through. They wouldn   t stick around  too long. See, this north south railroad that goes to Colorado and so on, that  was the one that they were traveling on most of the time.  Another thing we had for entertainment here was every summer, a tent show  that came in here. It was called the Hazel Heard Show. She had quite a show.  I can   t tell you how many years Hazel Heard came here.  There was another man that came in here with a tent show. Do you  remember? He came in here for years.  Chautauqua.  32  Cutter  Fowler  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Lemons  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Kite  Etling  Fowler  Cutter  Fowler  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Embry  Kite  Cutter  Chautauqua, well that   s what they used to have is Chautauqua.  Tent shows.  Uh-huh, tent shows.  Would they do a parade before they opened the show?  The circuses used to do that. My daddy used to let them bring the elephants  out to our place, and we had hay. Then we got a free pass to the show.  You had an elephant in your back yard.  We had a pretty good-sized farm, and they were off a little ways.  I know Hazel Heard always set up her tent where the post office is today.  That   s where the show was.  I don   t remember that, I guess.  What did Hazel Heard have in her show?  Oh, just plays. I don   t know how many people she had. Do you remember?  She had a little two or three act play.  Yeah, that   s what the Chautauqua were. I mean that   s another name for them.  They   d sing a little or have musician along.  Don   t you remember the old man who used to come in with his group?  I don   t remember that at all.  It starts with a    B.     Didn   t they sell that     Tonic.  Yeah, that would heal anything, and they   d buy it.  I remember the old man Jameson that used to play a harmonica and do the jig,  and that was at school. He would come to the school and do that.  I   ve got a question for the hobo. Sometimes people will talk about the different  signs and symbols hobos would leave.  A smiley face.  33  Kite  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Embry  Ford  Kite  Cutter  Etling  Embry  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Kite  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Meaning this is a good house or don   t go to this place. Do you remember any  of those symbols at all?  They had them here, because it was a smiley face.  No, that was just a story.  Well, I think it was really true, because I   ve heard of it too, and the symbols  that they left were to tell the other hobos that came along after them that it was  a good place or not to go there.  Good stopping place.  Yeah, something like that. They had symbols.  A lot of times women will talk about their house being marked like that, and  pretty soon there would just be a stream of hobos coming to the back door.  Well, that   s what happened to our house. I don   t know that they had a mark  out on the gate, but I know they really knew where to come for a fried egg  sandwich  laughter . I guess that   s what we liked to watch, because we were  hungry and it wasn   t time for us to eat, and it smelled so good. They   d set  down and we   d look out on the porch and smell that fried egg sandwich smell.  It was really good.  I remember the Mexican man. Do you remember Monaco?  Uh-huh.  He   d come to town, and he   d always be yelling    Mice, mice.    He raised corn,  and he   d go up and down the street.  What   d he call it?  Mice.  The maize.  Oh, maize.  I can remember about the first time he started; the women, they didn   t want  any mice  laughing . Then he   d show them it was corn.  Old Monaco, he lived out north of town somewhere.  Is that what corn is in Mexican?  Maize.  34  Kite  Ford  Cutter  Etling  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Etling  Fowler  Cutter  Etling  Embry  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Fowler  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Fowler  Maize is what he was saying, but he was mispronouncing it.  Oh. We were talking about him this morning. He had two daughters.  Very bright women.  He didn   t have a wife. He just raised those girls, and that   s the way he raised  them, selling his    mice     laughter .  That   s the way old Joe is that lives across the street from me. He   s got a bunch  of kids, and he   s raising them by himself.  Joe who?  Rosa. One of the girls got married, and she   s got a little baby, so all these kids  baby-sit the baby all day, and she works and the husband works.  There   s a place out north of town, Castaneda, and that was named after them.  I mean Monaco, his name was Castaneda. There   s a, well, I guess it was a  railroad.  It was a railroad camp.  But it isn   t anymore. There   s nothing there, I don   t think.  He didn   t live there. He lived in closer.  He lived in closer than that. You know where the Powers live. Okay, he lived  back off in there.  There were a lot of adobe homes built. What time was that period when they  used adobe to build their home instead of wood? Because there wasn   t any  wood in a lot of places for one thing.  I think that was a pretty wide period there. They were good houses.  Adobes are warm in the winter and cool in the summer.  I think the walls are about this thick, aren   t they?  We   ve got two adobes laying up there in  unclear .  Oh you have?  Yeah, I was looking at them earlier.  Did you look at that dugout they made?  Out here? Oh yeah.  35  Ford  Fowler  Cutter  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Cutter  Kite  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Etling  Cutter  Fowler  Cutter  Embry  Don   t you think that   s a wee bit small?  Well, they weren   t very big.  My mother was from Missouri, and she and her mother came out and proved  up a claim out here. When she was a little girl, they lived in a dugout.  We heard a story of this girl today who lived in a dugout from when she was  four to     Until she was sixteen or something like that.  Five of them in a two-room dugout.  Well my grandfather was hurt in the Civil War, and he wasn   t able to make the  trip, so they came out here four consecutive years so they could have land.  I was hoping they   d keep on digging and make it bigger and they   d put a little  old bed in there and a little old stove or something. Maybe they did; I don   t  know.  You had to be on the land for a year in order to get a patent on it. That   s the  land that I have now. That was right on the corner where they had the dugout.  That land we had down south that had a dugout on it.  Are we getting out of control?  Yeah, hobo   s getting things out of control over there.  Yeah, we   ve got to get back in control here. Bless your heart, you   ll never get  where you   re going tonight.  I   m going to bed tonight. When do you remember things getting better? Is  there something in particular in your memory that constitutes that?  Probably about    42, 1942.  In the forties. We raised our first crop about forty.  Before World War II started.     39 or    40.  I can remember that they didn   t have enough room for the grain, so they had to  put it out. There was no place to store it.  They just piled it.  36  Ford  Etling  Fowler  Etling  Kite  Embry  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Etling  Embry  Cutter  Ford  Fowler  Cutter  Fowler  We   ve still got that down here, those elevators.  We had a heck of a crop in    40; I remember that.  It was worth some money.    41 was the first time I ever made any money in  my life.  Yeah, that was the year the war broke out. My dad was sheriff at that time.  Well, as a wrap up question then, sometimes we talk about how you lived  through the dust bowl as a child or young adult, and that was a pretty trying  time. What marks has that left on you today? What do you carry with you  from those days? Now I   m asking you how it changed your life. How has it  made you the person you are today?  Well, I can remember when it was so bad that lots of times we would just open  up all the doors after this dirt had gone down, and just let it blow through.  You couldn   t sweep it. It was like it was waxy or something. It was so fine.  It pretty near just came through the glass. We   d just open the door and let it  blow out, and then what it didn   t blow out, we swept and cleaned. I was glad  to see those dirt storms stop. They still come back, don   t they?  Every once in a while.  What changed me is that I never really took anything for granted again. If you  could make something out of something else, you did it. You just thought that  was the way people did. I think that came from that time, because I saw my  parents do it. You felt like you had really accomplished something if you  could use something over again. We call it recycle today.  I   m still stuck with that. I just hang on to things. You   d be surprised. I think,  boy, I might need this.  I think that   s true. I think we   re all kind of that way.  I do too.  It made you a little more aware of your money and what   s important and what  isn   t.  How about you?  Well, I think everybody   s a little tougher. Do you remember old Worth  Wiggins?  Worth Wiggins, yes. Keyes?  He and I used to work together quite a bit. He told me one time, and the wind  was blowing, and he said,    You know, this wind is the best asset this country  37  Ford  Kite  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Fowler  Ford  Fowler  Ford  Kite  Ford  Kite  Ford  has. It keeps the people away to where it leaves the rest of us room to work.      Laughter   I never thought of it that way.  No   I think one of the things that maybe have changed me, it   s real hard for me to  throw away food. I don   t know why. I   ll move it to this dish, and then I   ll  move it to a smaller dish before I   ll throw that food out. I never was hungry. I  don   t know why, but I did know people that were.  And our parents would always say,    You   d better eat all that. Don   t waste that  food, because there   s some child in China that is hungry.    They did make  quite a little fuss on you there. You ate what you were supposed to. You  didn   t want anybody going hungry in China   Laughing   My family tells me that, because I just cannot throw it away after a meal. I   ve  got to save it for a day anyway  laughter .  We ate quite a bit of mush. Everybody had a cow and some chickens. My  wife and I got married in 1934. One aunt and uncle gave us a dozen hens, and  one of the other uncles gave me another dozen hens, so we had two-dozen  hens. We had them out in the middle of the ranch. When they quite laying  eggs, and we didn   t have eggs to eat, then we had to eat a hen once in a while   laughter . Between the coyotes and us we finally ran out of chickens before it  was over. We had a bunch of cows down there that we milked and sold the  cream. In 1936, it got so dry that we didn   t raise any feed. Those cows had to  do something, so we rounded them up and shipped them to Kansas City. You  couldn   t sell them here. They didn   t bring enough money to pay the freight.  I remember when I was growing up, I had to herd cattle in the summertime,  and they didn   t have fences then. I had a pure black horse I rode, and I   d have  to go out and stay all day with the cattle and keep them out of eating  something.  That   s what the kids had to do, herd cows.  And keep them out of something that would kill them, eating bad weeds or  anything like that. By gosh, that   s what I did day in and day out.  What was your horse   s name?  Nigger  laughter .  Oh   Laughing   That   s why I looked around.  38  Kite  Cutter  Kite  Fowler  Etling  Cutter  Kite  Embry  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Kite  Cutter  Ford  Etling  Cutter  That was a different time.  I had one named Black Beauty. An old plug.  That   s a better name   Laughter   I called mine Peg.  What do you think would happen to this generation if they had to go through  what we went through?  I think they would be resourceful. I think they   d have to do it.  It   d take them a while, but everybody pulls out at the end.  I don   t know whether they could handle it or not.  But let me tell you something about the wind. When that wind was harnessed,  it was a beneficial thing to this county, for one thing, the windmills. We had  plenty of water for the cattle. I just think the wind could be a resource as well  as a detriment.  You   re right, because we had a wind charger.  Yeah, wind chargers were big.  It would make juice and go down the batteries, and daddy went around and  wired up everybody in the whole neighborhood   s houses. They bought wind  chargers, and one day I went out there and looked up, and that old wind  charger was going around like that. So I had a baseball  gasps are heard from  the others . Guess what. I threw it up there. I was going to have that wind  charger throw it back to me. I was going to play catch. It just broke that  blade all to pieces. I never did figure out what happened out there.  You didn   t know anything about it, huh?  Well, I wasn   t confessing. But daddy then started making blades, and he got  in the blade business. He made quite a bit of money out of it.  So you helped him out.  So wind was a good source of energy too.  Sure I did. I don   t know what he   d have done to me.  That   s the reason I asked that question, is because that   s asked a lot of the  younger people.  If they could survive.  39  Etling  Cutter  Etling  Ford  Cutter  Ford  Kite  Cutter  Etling  Kite  Etling  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Cutter  Kite  Ford  Well, I know I have two grandsons.    Well, I don   t know whether we could  buckle down like that or not Nana.    They   ve been asked that before. I feel  like they could if they had too.  I think they   d face a different kind of thing.  That   s right.  I think they   d feel a real crunch though, don   t you?  Yeah, it   d take a while.  You give any of these kids money now, and if they can get enough to get a  new car, they spend it right away.  I   m going to stand up for my generation. We are what you made us, right then  and there.  You   re exactly right.  That   s why I think you could do it.  Well good for you.  I really think you could. I may be wrong. I think my grandsons could, and I  think you could.  Thanks for your confidence. Shelly, do you have anything you want to talk  about?  The only thing I want to ask is how you got your nickname.  Oh yeah.  Oh me? Well, when I was a little girl, my father always had big garden. He  had cucumbers, and I would go out and steal the little cucumbers, the small  ones. They kind of have a furry feel to them, but that didn   t stop me, and I ate  those. I   d always have a tummy ache, but he   d call me little Mrs. Cukie, and  that   s where I got it. And it   s stuck like glue. He asked me about Ione, my  middle name, and he said he   d never heard that before. Were you the one that  asked that?  Then I was talking to somebody else, sometime when we tell people about their  project, they ask who else is doing it, so I   ll give them names, and they   ll say,     Oh yeah, Cukie.    Nobody used your real name.  I bet you people wouldn   t know you by Mary Ione.  40  Kite They dismissed that immediately and went to Cukie.  -------  -------
