 Kite  Wood  Let   s go around the table, even if you   re just here as an accomplice, and tell  your name, where you were born, and when.  I   m Aline Couch, and I was born here  Guymon  in 1923. I   ve lived here all  of my life, and the most vivid memory I have of the dirt storm days was one  Easter Sunday. I think it was that April 14th storm that we still talk about.  About five or six of the cousins had decided to walk from grandpa   s farm over  the uncle Dick   s farm. It was probably two miles, but it was a beautiful day,  and we walked over. We started back, and this black storm came rolling in.  We finally got to where we couldn   t even see our hand in front of our face. It  was just completely black. Vernon, my older brother, had us hold hands, and  we walked until we came to a barbwire fence. Then we followed the fence a  little ways, and he picked up tumbleweeds that were blowing against the fence,  and made a little fort for us, a little windbreaker. He had us all sit there and  wait until somebody came to look for us. Sure enough, eventually, here came  grandpa in his old car and mom sitting on the fender. They had the lights on,  but they couldn   t see us until they were right upon us. We were sure glad to  see them. Of course, we all crawled in the car and went back home, but there  were a lot of times like that. That   s the one memory that I have of the dirt  storms.  You were riding on the fender?  I guess, I don   t remember, but I probably was.  All right, your turn.  I was Lula Rider, and I married Theo Wood in 1919. We were poor folks, but  we didn   t know it. We had lots of dirt storms. I was born in 1903. Anyhow,  we had the dirt storms, and one that I remember, the wind came up from the  north. We had a lot of chickens, and it was in the daytime, so they weren   t in  the hen house where they ought to have been. It blew them down in the  pasture. After the storm was over, we went and picked up the chickens. There  was mud all over those chickens, and we went and picked up chickens out of  the pasture south of the house. I remember that and a lot of other memories  that I   d just as soon not remember, but that   s just part of it.  5  Weeks  Focks  Kite  Focks  Kite  Pate  Kite  Wood  Focks  Kite  I was born September 24, 1913, 17 miles northwest of Guymon. My parents  came to the panhandle in 1905. They bought a relinquishment 16 miles from  Guymon. There was a dugout on the place, and they lived in that. Then they  moved. They bought other land and moved west, but it was still 17 miles from  Guymon. Times were hard, but we didn   t know it. We were happy. During  the dirty thirties, I was married to Russell Weeks   June 28, 1933. We bought  a house from George Beer, and fixed up two rooms that we could live in. The  dirt storms were terrible. The time when the dirt storms would come, we  would take a scoop shovel to scoop the dirt out. Today, that house wouldn   t  be called livable  laughter , but we lived there. Every year we would do  something to improve the looks of the house. We finally built onto the house  and made it modern. We even got running water in the bathroom. We thought  we were doing real well. The government was paying 50 cents an acre to have  land listed to stop it from blowing. My husband contracted to list the land, and  he had hired C.E. Dain to help him drive the tractors to list. They worked day  and night. Part of the time, they couldn   t see to drive to and from the house.  I   m Vernal Steinkuehler Focks, and I was born July 18, 1923, six miles east of  Guymon, where I grew up and went to school. I went to school at New Bethel,  which was a mile and a half from home. That   s one of my biggest memories is  either riding a horse or trying to walk in that dirt. I also remember how my  mother tried so hard to keep the house livable with no electricity. We did have  running water; we always had running water. In order to get the dirt out, she  would take whatever was movable outside and beat it, like the couch and the  curtains off the windows.  And the kids  laughter .  Yeah, the kids. She   d like to have; I was her youngest of seven.  Okay, we have your name down as Mrs. Pate. How did you end up here?  Where were you born?  I was born here October 18, 1921. We stayed here until 1922, and we moved  to Enid. Then we moved back in 1930. I started the first grade here.  So we   ve got a lot of people here that were born here and stayed here despite  everything being so bad.  We were too poor to leave.  That was one of things that I was going to tell about my mother, one day she  was trying to get the dirt out of the house with a shovel, and my dad came in  and said,    Mama, do you want to leave here?    She said,    Where would we  go?    and he said,    Back to Missouri, I guess,    and she said,    I   d as soon  shovel dirt as mud.    It was never mentioned again that we would leave. He  had come here in 1906 and she came here in 1908.  You   d better watch it, Shelly   s from Missouri.  6  Focks  Wood  Kite  Pate  Kite  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Wood  Focks  Kite  Focks  Kite  Focks  Kite  Wood  I have bunches of cousins back there.  The doctor told my husband he was going to have to take his family and get  out of here. Well, when you   ve got a bunch of kids, where do you go?  There   s no money or anything to go on, so we were too poor to leave. That   s  the reason we stayed. A lot of them that left came back.  What about you two, Mrs. Weeks and Mrs. Pate, did you ever think about  leaving? Well, I guess your family did.  They left for a little while, yeah, but then they came back when I was not quite  nine-years-old. And then we moved back. Well, I   ve come and gone several  times, but my mother   s family moved out there from Ohio in 1905. They  homesteaded six miles north of Guymon, on the Hurlimen Road.  Mrs. Weeks, your family never wanted to take off and head out of the dust  bowl?  We were determined that we were going to conquer the dirt and make a good  living.  Do you think that most people stayed because they were too poor to leave or  because they were trapped? For what reason did most people stay?  Too poor.  Where would you go?  I think my parents stayed because they were proud. Dad thought this was the  most wonderful country in the whole world. During his last illness, he wrote a  poem that I wish I would have brought with me. It was about this wonderful  country and how he   d stand and watch for clouds to come and bring some rain.  You can send a copy to us, or we can send you an envelope or something.  That   d be great, we   d love to have that.  I would love it, too.  What about family or friends that moved away? Did you remember losing  cousins or aunts or uncles or friends?  I didn   t have any  laughter . They stayed in Missouri.  Any relatives or close friends that moved away?  We had some close friends that moved away. They needed a tire. I remember  my husband fixing up some old tires to let this man have. His car wouldn   t  hardly go, but he took off for California anyhow. As far as I know, he stayed.  I don   t know whether he ever came back or not. People helped each other in  7  Focks  Kite  Focks  Kite  Wood  Weeks  Wood  Focks  Kite  Wood  Focks  Kite  Pate  those days, much more than they do now.  My older sister and her husband, Charles Mildred Lee and Aubrey Viola  Erhart, took off for California in a dirt storm, and they came back in a dirt  storm  laughter . They found that they just couldn   t live in California.  Was it for any particular reason?  I think it was mostly that Charles had his parents here and Aubrey Viola   s  parents owned the land they lived on. I think they came back just to preserve  their land as much as anything. I never did know. I was just a kid, and I was  just so glad to see my little nephew again at that time. I didn   t care why they  came back. They came back in a dirt storm though; I do remember that.  Mrs. Weeks was talking about living in a house that today would be considered  unlivable. Do you all have any stories like that?  If it had running water, she was lucky.  We didn   t the first few years.  But you said you did, and that was a great privilege.  My dad was a promoter. He had that farm fixed. He had the windmill set  here, and then there was a storage tank for the house that was set way up high.  When that got full, it drained into a great big cement tank. That was piped in  three directions to the stock tanks. He kept fish in that big tank, to keep it  cleaned out. It had a roof over it. I always wanted to get in there and swim,  but he wouldn   t allow that.  You   d dirty it up.  My daddy had a cement tank. One end of it we could get in, but at the other,  my mother had water lilies growing on top of it.  We could get in the stock tanks and swim if we wanted to. Well, not swim,  because it wasn   t deep enough to swim.  What do you remember about your first house outside of your parent   s house?  What was it like?  That would have been an apartment in Amarillo when I got married. I wanted  to show you these pictures of my grandparents place. My mother was 19 when  they moved out here from Ohio. They came by train. They had boxcars. One  of the boys had to ride in the boxcar. I think it left a stamp on him. He never  was the same after that. He wasn   t happy; he didn   t like it out here, and he  didn   t stay. My grandmother had ten children. My mother was the seventh  child and the first girl. When she stepped off the train down here in March, the  wind took her hat. She said damn the wind, and she never stopped saying that   8  Kite  Pate  Kite  Pate  Kite  Pate  Kite  Pate  Kite  Wood  Couch  Wood  Kite  Wood  Couch  Wood  It doesn   t sound like they had a very pleasant trip out here. They made one of  your uncles ride in the boxcar.  Yeah, I think they had a cow or two in there. I don   t know, but she said that  she had always thought that it left a mark on him. They brought two great big  tents, and that   s what they lived in.  Do you have a picture of them?  Well, I did have.  That   s a pretty good picture right back there. Did all of you have a rural life  here? Did you grow up outside of town?  Daddy was a traveling salesman, and when we came back here from Enid, he  was traveling in Texas. He   d come home once in a year or two, a long time  between times. He eventually gave that up and came back and lived here.  What would your mother do?  My mother taught music. She was a musician. She taught piano and voice.  Was your lifestyle rural?  Yes, we had coal oil lamps. Then we got a Coleman lamp, and we thought  that that was really something. We finally got a gasoline.  Mom came here in a covered wagon.  Yes, and we were 17 days on the road. They had the chicken coops fastened  on the side of the wagon. There were several wagons at one time. They all  washed up in the washboards and all those things. We had what they called a  little monkey stove at that time. It had two burners, and this covered wagon  had a place for the stove pipe to go out through, so we had heat in the covered  wagon. They drove the cattle, what few we had, and horses along.  And that was from Chandler, is that right?  Down close to Stroud and Chandler, down in there.  And a jar of jelly.  Well, that was a trip we made later, to see my grandmother. My mother had  canned up a bunch of apple butter. You probably wouldn   t know what the  overjett was, the sideboards on the wagon that made the bed up high. Us kids  slept underneath there. There was straw in there, and then they put the  bedding in there. That   s where we slept. My mother and daddy slept up here.  My mother cooked on this little monkey stove. She had canned up this apple  butter into a big five-gallon crock. Anyhow, they let us kids out every so often  9  Kite  Wood  Kite  Pate  Kite  Pate  Kite  Pate  Kite  to walk. Then we   d have to take our shoes off when we got back in on account  of the bedding. So we   d been out walking and they let us back in. We had a  third horse, and back then the roads were just ruts. This one horse pushed the  other and turned the wagon over. There we were, us kids barefooted, jumped  out in the snow. My mother was digging among the bedclothes trying to find  our shoes for us. She felt something cold on her feet, and it was her apple  butter that had turned over. You could imagine what kind of a mess that  would be.  Five gallons of apple butter.  Anyhow, we all survived.  Let   s see these pictures here.  They lived in these two tents until they got the first two rooms built.  Now this was your grandparents?  My mother   s parents. And she lived out there. Later, she would come to  town. They had a little mare they called Bonnie. She loved that mare. She   d  drive the buggy and the mare to town and she   d go to the dry goods store.  Then she got itchy feet and took off for Wyoming. There was a pianist  salesman who came through here that told her that there was a wonderful  opportunity for somebody with her talents who could teach down there and  work in Wyoming. So she took off for Wyoming, and grandpa thought she   d  just drop off when she got there; it was the end of the world as far as he was  concerned. She met my father then, so she went up there and taught in several  towns. Then she met my father and came back here and made her wedding  dress. Then he came back here to marry her, and they were married here in  Guymon. Then they went back to Thermopolis. My oldest sister was born  there.  When daddy saw this country, of course he had come from Arkansas and  Missouri where they had trees, here there was just flat ground. My  grandparents did plant trees, but most of it looked like this. That   s my aunt  and uncle living in a dugout. They were just right north of where Wal-Mart is  now. When daddy saw this country, he said that it must be underneath because  it sure isn   t on top. Then he turned out to be right when he discovered the gas  and the oil and stuff that turned up.  That   s a funny saying.  After they got it fixed, this was the home. Grandmother raised chickens and  grandfather had piped. They had a windmill, and the best water in the country.  That well was deep. It was about 320 feet deep out there on that farm.  That is deep.  10  Pate  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Kite  Pate  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Pate  Wood  Focks  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Couch  Pate  Focks  Kite  Yeah, for this country it is. But it was good clean water. He piped all around  to the north side of the house. She had gardens and flowers. He had pipes laid  out and faucets sticking up everywhere. It was wonderful. She raised all sorts  of vegetables and flowers and everything. She   s also a portrait painter. She  had studied to do portrait painting. I have one of her portraits hanging in my  living room. She won so many prizes they finally asked her to not compete in  the fair anymore  laughter .  I brought dirt storm pictures.  Let   s look at them.  This was coming in from the north of our house.  I just can   t imagine sitting and watching that thing cover up the sky.  Oh yeah, you have no idea.  This was a picture of Rolla, taken at Rolla.  Where   s Rolla?  Rolla, Kansas.  It   s just a little ways north.  I wish we had saved our pictures.  I guess we were too poor to buy film. I think we had an old camera, but we  didn   t ever take any pictures.  Well, our first one was a real one.  This one I   ve seen. This is one we   ve got at OSU. Do you know where this  was taken?  Goodwell.  I guess that might be part of the school or something.  And these others are commercial pictures.  Do you remember different colors?  I do.  That looks like Black Sunday there.  All of these look like black something  laughing .  11  Weeks  Couch  Wood  Kite  Lemons  Focks  Kite  Weeks  Focks  Weeks  Couch  Pate  Wood  Kite  Pate  Wood  Weeks  Kite  Wood  Kite  Pate  This one is one that we   ve seen many a time.  And you remember the different layers of dirt, different colors, red and white.  My oldest son, he could always see some beauty in everything. He   d see the  color and say, oh isn   t that beautiful. We didn   t think it was beautiful, but to  him it was.  Now we heard a story about this out in Boise City. This was taken right  outside of Boise City. This, they had a funeral for a minister, and right after  the funeral was over the dust storm hit, and his face appeared in the clouds.  This was the guy that was buried that day.  It did kind of look like him in the picture they had.  I never had heard that story. I just always heard that that was the face of God.  Who are these troublemakers?  Those are my nieces.  Rabbit drives on Sunday.  That was a picture of the rabbit drives.  I remember the rabbit drives.  They were just eating the crops, so they   d drive them into the fence and kill the  rabbits.  And then club them. They   d just hit them in the head.  Did you ever eat the rabbits?  We did. My daddy would go out and trap them. He built traps and caught  rabbits. Then he   d freeze them and hang them over the clothesline.  The cottontails and the young jackrabbits were real good.  They would sell the ears.  Did you ever eat the older jackrabbits?  Well, I don   t know how old they were, but we ate them all the time.  And they would sell the ears for money?  You fried it just like you do chicken.  12  Kite  Couch  Weeks  Wood  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Focks  Pate  Focks  Wood  Kite  Wood  Focks  Pate  Wood  Pate  And you would get money for killing the rabbits.  It was a bounty for killing the rabbits.  I don   t remember how much, but it was pretty good. I think it was two cents  per ear or something like that.  Well, they got so much for coyote ears.  Part of the time, that was all we had for groceries.  Was just your rabbit ear money.  Yes.  But nearly everyone had their own milk cow and chickens.  Chickens.  Or more than one milk cow at our house.  Well we had cattle and pigs and things like that, but I had a friend that told me  that her mother just thickened the milk and put salt in it. That was the way  they made their gravy. We were poor, but we weren   t that poor.  What was a typical meal like?  Ham and gravy and mashed potatoes and beans. We ate a lot of beans.  Lots of beans. Love them, still do.  Mother made what they call red eye, but we called it sop gravy. She   d fry ham  and put milk in the grease and make a real liquidy gravy. Then we   d pour that  over the bread and sop up the bread in it. That   s why it   s called sop gravy.  There was one house north of us on Beaver Street, so we had a perfect view of  these things coming in. You   d look out to the west-northwest and think it was  going to rain, that   s a rain cloud coming. Then it   d get a little bigger and a  little bigger, but it had a certain slope down this way and you knew it was the  dirt coming. We had a north door. The dirt was so bad and the wind was so  hard, so mother took old brown tape and taped the front door shut. Everyone  had to come in the back door, students, everybody, traipsed through the house.  That tape got so wide all around the doors and windows trying to keep the dirt  out of the house.  We   d wet blankets and things and put over the windows and doors.  But that tape, there   d be a little teeny place where it didn   t quite glue. The  wind would wail through that like a banshee. It was horrible. It would just  13  Kite  Couch  Pate  Kite  Weeks  Pate  Kite  Weeks  Focks  Pate  Kite  Focks  Kite  Focks  Pate  Focks  Pate  Kite  hurt your ears, and there was no way to find where that hole was.  I think that was yesterday. That picture was taken yesterday.  That was the wind from the dirt storms. We didn   t have the dirt.  Well, there was dirt in the sky yesterday.  We   ve heard a few stories about birds, flocks of birds, coming ahead of the  storm. Do you all remember that?  Yes.  Trying to get away.  Were there any other signs that storms were coming? Some people would say  that when they saw the birds start flying they knew something was up.  It would get just real still. You could just feel the stillness before the wind and  dirt would start.  It was a pressure. Aline was telling about Black Sunday. So many people  have written about that.  What year was that?     35.     35.  April 14th.  I was a mile from home, at my sister   s house, on my horse, and Dad just saw  that barely coming up over the horizon. He told me to get on my horse and get  home as quick as you can. I rode that mile just as fast as I could ride. I just  barely got to the gate before it hit.  Just barely made it.  That   s how fast they   d come, and yet, like Emma said, there   d be such a  pressure on you before they really got there.  We couldn   t have a blizzard without having dirt with it. It looked like  chocolate snow. It   d blow dirt on top of the snow after a snowstorm. Then, of  course, we had some good blizzards too, like that one in    57.  Do you remember people getting caught out in some of those storms and  having to wait it out somewhere? Did any of you all ever have that  experience?  14  Weeks  Pate  Weeks  Kite  Couch  Focks  Kite  Couch  Focks  Kite  Focks  Kite  Pate  Kite  We did; we got lost. We finally decided to stop and wait to see if it would  clear up. When it cleared up, we were right up against the house. But we  couldn   t see ahead of the car.  Couldn   t see.  The bumper was right up against the side of the house.  You   re lucky you didn   t run into it. You were telling us a story about having to  build a fort.  Yes, and it was sort of a windbreak that protected us a little bit. It was cold  too. It suddenly just got really cold. We were out in our short-sleeves because  it had been a beautiful Sunday afternoon. All of the sudden, the temperature  dropped and that terrible wind, but my brother had presence of mind to build  this little fort for protection. He had us all hold hands so we wouldn   t get lost  from each other. We always thought he was kind of a hero.  He was.  Never mind that your mom was out riding on the fender looking for you   laughter .  Yes.  Looking for you. That   s what Ruthie and some of her girlfriends did. One of  them was old enough to drive a car, and they   d gone for a drive. They were  lost in that. Mom was just pacing the floor. You couldn   t see anything. You  couldn   t see the coal oil lamp or any other kind of light in the house. Mom  was just pacing the floor. Just as soon as it got light enough, my brothers went  out and found her and her friends. They were all right. I think that they were  at another neighbor   s house. We were the only people out there that had  telephones for miles around, so we couldn   t call anybody to see where they  were, because nobody had a phone.  What good was your telephone  laughter ?  Well, it called town. That   s why we had it was for machinery parts.  Do you remember the first time you saw it rain after a long time? Do you  remember a particular storm and what you thought about it?  I remember the smell. I know how it smelled when it first hit the ground. Oh  that wonderful odor. And it still smells that way, good to me. When it starts  raining, and that rain hits the dirt there   s a certain pungent odor that you never  forget.  And it brings you back to the first time.  15  Pate  Kite  Focks  Pate  Focks  Kite  Focks  Wood  Kite  Wood  Pate  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Focks  Weeks  Wood  Couch  Yeah, I don   t remember exactly the first time that it rained after all that, but it  continued. It   d rain, but we   d still have dirt storms. They   d be coming from  all directions, Kansas, Texas, Nebraska, Colorado, everywhere.  On top of that, you have the Depression going on.  Yes we did.  Oh yes, it was terrible. In that house on Beaver, I also remember Daddy would  build a nice kitchen cabinet, and or course the dining room table was in the  kitchen, but we would set the table and put the plates upside down, because  they would get full of dirt before you could get the meal on the table. When  you sat down to eat, you turned the plate over and ate real fast.  If we had company or hired hands, sometimes we smaller kids got to stand  with a dishtowel trying to keep the dust away from the table.  Was that a job you enjoyed?  No, because I really didn   t eat always.  There were a lot of people in those days that didn   t have screens on their  windows. Those kept the flies away.  There weren   t any screens?  Not everybody had screens. Lots of the neighbors didn   t have curtains. My  mother always had curtains for the windows; she made them out of sugar sacks  and things like that.  Many of them didn   t have sewing machines, and my mother sewed for so  many. They   d come and spend the day, and she   d fix dinner for them and sew.  We always used the chicken feed sacks for dresses. I   ve made sheets out of  chicken feed sacks.  Do you have any of those dresses left still? Have you kept any of those feed  sack dresses?  We wore them out.  They wore out pretty quick, because they had to be scrubbed.  You didn   t have too many either.  The people were good to help each other.  We were poor folks, but we didn   t know it because we   d never had any better.  16  Weeks  Wood  Kite  Pate  Kite  Pate  Wood  Pate  Wood  Pate  Focks  Couch  Focks  Couch  Pate  Couch  Focks  Pate  Focks  But we had good neighbors.  Yes we did. We made that old lye soap and did a lot of things like that.  What about Delphine?  Mother always had dreams of going off to a music concert or something.  She   d been talking about it, and I said,    Oh, how nice that would be,    and  dumb me, I said something to Delphine about it. She said,    Well, you won   t  go anywhere, you wear the same dress to school everyday.     Laughter   She had several dresses?  She had a change. Yes, she had more than two anyway.  Now who was this lady?  That was Delphine Cathcarl.  Oh yes, I remember. We used to live across the street from her.  We lived across the street from her too.  That   s one of the nice things about having cousins in Missouri, they sent Ruthe  and me each a dress one year. She was a junior, and I was a freshman, maybe  sophomore and senior, but anyhow, they sent each of us a dress. Mom had to  alter mine. Louise was even taller than I. In chemistry class, I had an  explosion. Were you in there that day when I exploded that?  Probably.  And it went right down my dress, and took the pleat out. Mom just cut that out  and sewed it back together. The next time I wore it to school, which was  probably the next day, Mr.   what was his name?  Simpson.  Fox, we had a Fox chemistry teacher at one time.  Simpson, that sounds right.  Simpson. He said,    Vernal, don   t spill acid on your dress again, there   s no  way your mother can fix it.     Another time, I sang, so I got to appear on stage. Sometimes I   d forget my  words, but I sang anyway.  Also played.  17  Pate  Focks  Pate  Focks  Kite  Focks  Pate  Focks  Pate  Kite  Wood  Kite  Wood  Weeks  Pate  Yeah, I played piano, and I was in all the plays. I got to do that too. She had  made me a red tunic with a black skirt. It was a beautiful thing. Well, I was  running down the hall, and there were oiled wooden floors in the old high  school building. I wasn   t supposed to be running but I was. Well, Leroy  Munson, God love him, stuck his foot out and tripped me, and down I went. I  got black grease on my nice new dress.  Oh goodness.  Oh, I was so unhappy. I didn   t forgive him for a long time, but I finally did.  Can I tell about the first time I remember Christine?  Sure.  She was in a school play, and I was a freshman. I was so impressed with  everything in town, because I had been in a country school all my life. You  had to play that you were a mad woman, and you were playing the piano like  you were a mad woman. I   ll never forget that, because she just really did that  part well.  I don   t remember the play   Well think hard, because it was good.  I remember one time I had to wring my hands. Maybe that was the one when  Mary Hays was the teacher. Wring your hands, do this, do this  I felt like  Zazu Pitts, and that   s who I thought about when I was doing it. She was an old  actress.  Well, that   s kind of a good line to go on. Do you remember coming to town for  movies? Did you ever have the opportunity?  Yes, we came to the movies. I think they called it the Nickelodeon. I think  that it cost a nickel to go back then. And Cathy Funk, she used to do special  little dances and things like that. I think that went on. We   d come every once  in a while; when we   d come to town, we   d go to the movie.  Mrs. Weeks, who was your favorite star  laughter ?  Well, I go back a lot further than these other girls.  It   d probably be some western. Tom Mix, probably. Mr. Funk owned the  theatre. They had a player piano with the rolls, and Nelson would sit there and  pump the music. I know he was tired.  Well now, before that it was called the Diamond Theatre, and they used to  have Vaudeville acts come through town. Mr. Funk owned the theatre. It was  called The Diamond Theatre, but it was probably before your time. They   d  18  Kite  Wood  Couch  Focks  Wood  Kite  Wood  Pate  Wood  Kite  Pate  bring manuscripts, these traveling people coming through watching the show.  They had their own music, and mother was the only one in town that could  read manuscript, so she   d play for them. She played piano at the old Diamond  Theatre.  Okay old-timer, what do you remember in the theatre?  Well, I don   t know, and I said about the nickelodeon, but I don   t know that  they called it the nickelodeon. I think that   s what it used to cost to get in, was  a nickel.  I remember, they called them friendship nights, and two could go for the price  of one. That was about the only time we went.  Wednesday nights they would give prizes. You might win as much as  25 or   50.  That was lots of money in those days. That   d buy a lot of stuff. That wouldn   t  buy a bag of groceries today.  What else would you do for fun, if you didn   t want to go up to the movies?  What else would you do to entertain yourselves?  We had a burro. A lot of times when we had company, two kids would get up  on this burro and ride to the top of the hill. When they got to the top of the  hill, they   d come back and someone else would ride to the top of the hill. The  old burro got to where that was as far as he would go sometimes. My sister  decided she would ride this burro to the neighbor   s. Well, she came into my  mother, and was crying. She said she had decided to go to the neighbors, but  the burro got to the top of the hill and he turned around and came back.  Isn   t that cute   That   s the way we entertained. Our farm was right on the Texas line. Over in  Texas, there was a big hill. I say a big hill, not like a mountain. Anyway, it  had a tree growing up there, and we always thought there was an Indian buried  there. We   d take a syrup bucket full of water and the spade, and we had a little  cart that we hooked the burro too. We   d go up there and dig at that little  Indian grave because they told us that Indians buried all their beads and  everything with them. We just knew that sometime, and I still wonder. We  never did get down deep enough. Anyhow, that was entertainment.  Everybody wanted to dig in that grave. We had fun.  I   ve never heard of digging up graves for entertainment, but that   s all right   laughter . Church was your entertainment?  Yeah, I didn   t have the money to go to the show hardly ever, so I   d go to  church on Sunday nights and Wednesday nights.  19  Kite  Focks  Kite  Wood  Weeks  Pate  Kite  Weeks  Wood  Focks  Wood  Focks  Wood  Weeks  Wood  Kite  Focks  Kite  Focks  What about games you played with friends?  Annie Over.  That seems to be a real popular one.  Party games.  Kick the can.  Hop along Josie and three little girls a skating went.  What   s hop along Josie? Do you know how to play that?  Yes, it was played of an evening, when we   d have a party. All the young  people would come, and we would play these party games. We   d sing.  This one was    Three little girls a skating went, a skating went. They fell  down, and       they had to have boys. Then you   d go pick your partner, and  he   d go help you out.  How about Skip to my Lou? Do you remember that one?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I remember Percy, my brother-in-law, singing that. They didn   t  let me play.  Well, my mother never let us go to dances, but we did have play parties at our  house.  We had them just about every Saturday evening. They   d break up, what you   d  call early now, so they could be Sunday school and Church the Sunday after.  And our preachers of different denominations that come through the country,  they would stay and preach, and a lot of times they didn   t hardly take in  enough money to move them on to the next place, but people would give as  much as they could.  What would go on at a play party?  It was kind of like a circle dance, the way I remember it. I didn   t get to  participate.  Why not?  They didn   t let the little kids in. This was my married sister   s and brother   s  that I remember doing this. Percy, my brother-in-law, always sang. He had  such a pretty voice. The main one I remember is Skip to My Lou.  20  Kite  Focks  Wood  Focks  Wood  Weeks  Focks  Kite  Weeks  Kite  Wood  Weeks  Focks  Wood  Focks  Wood  Kite  Focks  Would they sing Skip to My Lou at play parties?  Yes. Focks and I square danced a lot, and it was kind of like the circle square  dances we used to do. You   d put your right hand and take your partner, and  then catch the next person with the left. Then someone would swing around. I  couldn   t explain it, because I can   t do it anymore.  I believe I   d give it a try.  It was fun at the time, but that   s what the play parties I remember were.  Well, we used to have them at our house. Our house wasn   t very big.  Pig in the Parlor.  Oh yes, Pig in the Parlor.  What   s Pig in the Parlor?  A young man would be inside a ring, and the rest of us would go around  singing. Then he   d choose his partner. Then whoever was that one   s partner  had to be in the center.  So were play parties an excuse to go meet with young men?  Oh yes. Everybody in the country came, your neighbors and all.  Adults.  And we visited.  Then on Sunday afternoon we   d have a singing, and they   d play the piano or  organ and sing. Just about every Sunday, there would be a group at our place,  and we   d play croquet and horseshoes. We   d play all afternoon and go to  church at night.  I don   t remember how deep the snow was, but dad didn   t want to get the car  out and we kids wanted to go visit the White kids, a mile and a half from us.  So he got the barge and a team of horses, and we all wrapped up in blankets  and went over to spend the evening with the White kids. People wouldn   t do  that now at all.  When we went to school, a lot of times, my mother would warm bricks and  wrap them in paper, and put them down in the buggy for us to put our feet on.  You bring up a good point about having electricity. Do you remember the first  time you got electricity in your house?  I do.  21  Wood  Weeks  Wood  Focks  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Focks  Wood  Focks  Kite  Focks  Weeks  Wood  Kite  Couch  I do. We didn   t have electricity until we moved to town.  We had a wind charger. It was a six-volt. We were the first ones in the  community that had electric lights. Six-volts lights don   t make a lot of light,  but we thought it was wonderful. When the wind blew, we   d have electric  lights, and when it didn   t, we   d go back to kerosene  laughter .  I   ve still got my old coal oil lamp.  I do too. We used it the other night.  A few years later, we got a thirty-two volt. It took more batteries to keep it  going.  It was a little brighter.  It was a little brighter. You could have more things on your electricity than  you could the other way.  Well, what was your favorite electrical appliance?  An iron.  An iron, yes.  My mother had a gasoline iron, and gasoline at that time was almost unheard  of. Anyhow, she got some gasoline and put it up on the organ. She told us  kids never to get close to that because it was explosive. We were proud of that  iron. It was a pretty blue color. We thought that was really something.  We had carbide lights first. The tank was in a vacuum. It sure made a good  trampoline  laughter . Something happened, and one of them caught fire to the  ceiling and Dad took them out.  Do you know how long a carbide tank would last with a charge in it?  No.  About a month.  I remember a tub of cow chips didn   t last very long.  Did those smell when you burned them? Do you remember burning cow  chips?  No, but I remember when we were little and would go out to Grandpa   s on  Sunday afternoon. He would hook up a wagon, and we   d go through the  pasture and pick up dried cow chips. Grandpa had a sense of humor, and he  said,    What you do is you stick your finger in it and if it goes clear through,  22  Kite  Wood  Couch  Wood  Kite  Focks  Wood  Focks  Kite  Pate  Couch  Wood  Focks  Kite  don   t pick it up.     Laughter   So how many times did you do that?  Well, they had to be dry to pick up, but he was teasing. That was just a joke.  But that was fuel, because coal was too expensive.  They didn   t make anything but ashes. I have a niece up in Colorado, and they  started this new machine that burns the wood, but it   s in little bitty pellets.  You can adjust your thing in your house and it takes care of the heat just like  ours does here in town. I told him that that sure beat carrying out those cow  chips. They were all ashes, and this wood hardly makes any ash at all. I  thought boy we missed it back then.  It was a real efficient stove.  That was my job. When I was six, my parents gave me a little red wagon.  Dad taught me how to set the coal bucket on the back end and go chop the  kindling and put it at the front and pull it to the back door and carry the coal  bucket in to the stove.  I remember our job was to get in the kindling and stuff like that. My daddy  got up and built the fire, but when my mother got up to fix breakfast, the water  and the milk and everything was frozen solid in the house. That wouldn   t be  an easy job. She   d fix breakfast, and we   d have biscuits every morning for  breakfast.  That is one of my saddest things to think of, that my mother didn   t live long  enough to have any of the real appliances. She was so proud of the ones she  had.  You almost have to think though that if you didn   t know any better, you  wouldn   t know what you were missing.  That   s right, we were all in the same boat.  Mom   s lived 99 years, so she   s got to see most of these changes.  Oh, I   m the luckiest person in the world. They had this party for me, and it  was the nicest thing you ever saw. I didn   t know an old woman could have so  much fun.  Shoot I did, because you   ve always had fun. You   ve always been a fun lady.  Well, I   m going to switch topics here real quick because there   s something  interesting that I want to get to. Some of the people have had visitors come by  the house, hobos or tramps.  23  Wood  Focks  Kite  Couch  Kite  Focks  Couch  Focks  Wood  Kite  Couch  Wood  Couch  Focks  Weeks  Wood  Weeks  Wood  Kite  Oh, we used to have them, and we fed every one of them. We never turned  one aside.  We had gypsies.  Gypsies. Are there any other gypsy stories in the group?  I can remember grandma telling about gypsies coming and going through.  Your mother would have gypsy stories? Let   s hear a few of those, if you don   t  mind.  Well, I only know one. The gypsies came to our back door and my mother  was at the door. I was hanging on to her, because I was scared. They   d left  their wagon at the little hill north of the house and walked down there. They  wanted money, but mom told them that she didn   t have any money. So they  kept saying,    Give me chicken, bring you luck.    I just don   t remember  whether she gave them a chicken or not. I suppose she did, because they left.  They were sticky fingers.  Oh yeah.  But we   d feed the hobos that used to ride the trains. We   d have dozens of  them in a days time, but we always gave them something.  Would you ever have them do work?  No, a lot of times they would offer.  We   d just give them a sandwich of some kind.  A bowl of beans.  There were always beans.  When the BM E railroad was built from Hooker out to us, when the elevators  were first put out there, Stacy Miller was a contractor for that. He had as many  as 20 men working for him at the same time.  We never locked our door, never thought of locking the door back then.  But they needed some place that would feed them. They had put a tent up and  put their mules under this tent during the winter stormy weather. My mother  fed the crew. Part of the time, there was 20 or more men at a time.  And if you had company, they always ate with you. That was part of it.  So you guys were never afraid of the hobos or the tramps?  24  Wood  Kite  Couch  Pate  Kite  Couch  Focks  Wood  Pate  Focks  Pate  Weeks  Kite  Pate  Kite  Couch  Pate  Couch  Pate  No, no, we weren   t afraid of them. They were all good back then.  But the gypsies weren   t.  The gypsies were a different breed.  The hobos were just people that were trying to get to a better life.  Don   t you think that it   s weird that there were gypsies out in the panhandle of  Oklahoma of all places? What were they doing out here?  I have no idea.  We lived six miles straight east of Guymon. You could go on the highway or  the cemetery road. These gypsies came down the cemetery road and then  turned south and left their wagon parked on the hill and walked to the house. I  don   t know what they were doing here, but they never came back. I always  looked up that hill.  My son-in-law now tells me to keep my door locked and not to let anyone in  unless I know who it is. I told him I lived in a time when you opened the door  and said come in. I can   t get away from that.  It   s still dangerous.  I   ve learned that.  Guymon   s not the place it was years ago.  My family all have a key to my door, so if they need to get in, they can.  When times got better, did the number of hobos and tramps slow down?  Yes, you never see them anymore.  When would you say you noticed a turn around? Was there something that  happened in your life that you were able to buy something that made you think  times were getting better?  After we had some rains and people made good wheat crops and things, then it  was just a complete turn around.  When would you say that was?  The forties?  That   s what I think, because I was working for Vincent Dale in    41. I  graduated from high school in    39, went to school for two years, and came  home to work. I still remember the dirt bowl then.  25  Focks  Kite  Wood  Pate  Wood  Focks  Pate  Focks  Wood  Focks  Wood  Kite  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Couch  The crops started getting good in the late thirties. That was just before my  mother became ill.  What was something you remember being able to afford that you hadn   t been  able to buy?  Our first Model-T car we had. I said if we ever had an airplane, I   d never be  as proud of it as I was that car. It had radius rods underneath and they got  bent. Every once in a while, it   d just take off sideways  laughter . My sister-in-  law, she tried to drive it, and she   d cluck to it and speak to it just like it was  a horse. She   d say whoa, whoa  We always laughed about her trying to drive,  because she was so used to the horses. We were proud of that car.  My uncle Wedin, when he got his first car, he drove through the end of his  garage saying whoa, whoa  laughter .  I can still remember the smell of the gasoline. When my daddy got his first  car, we went over through the country. There weren   t highways like there are  now. We just took off.  I should have brought my sister Delia   s story that she wrote about a trip that  we took in a Model-T in about    24. All seven of us in this car.  Oh boy.  She told how it was that Mom and the youngest brother and Dad   and Mom  held me on her lap and Ruthie sat on a little red chair at her feet. The other  four kids were sitting in the back seat all the way to Missouri.  We made trips like that.  They got caught in a big rain, and dad asked some man in a filling station how  the roads were to the next town. The fellow said they were just fine, good ruts  all the way  laughter .  Well, that   s about all there was back then. We didn   t know what a highway  was.  Mrs. Weeks, do you remember your first car?  The first experience was a Model-A. We thought it was great.  A little newer version than the Model-T.  The one we had before was completely worn out. This one still had side  curtains instead of glass. It was sure a dandy car.  Oh sure it was.  26  Focks  Wood  Kite  Wood  Weeks  Wood  Kite  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Wood  Weeks  Kite  Weeks  Wood  Kite  Focks  Wood  Pate  We   ve come a long way, baby   My husband taught me how to pull down on the gas lever that was up on the  wheel. You pulled down on it and you wouldn   t kill the engine. I drove down  to the neighbors, and they   ve had a tree out in front of their house. They were  both standing in the door watching me. I wanted to show them that I knew  how to stop without killing the engine. Well, I pulled down on the gas lever,  and I bent this little tree. I didn   t break it off. I wanted to show them that I  could stop without killing the motor.  You killed the tree though  laughter .  Back then, you had to get out and crank them.  You pulled the gas lever down and just went.  Yes, it just kept going, and that old tree kept bending.  So you   d say cars were one of the first things that you bought with the good  crop money.  Oh, I was so proud of the bathroom when we got a bathroom.  An indoor bathroom?  That was something.  That was great.  We had water in the kitchen, but it was one of those faucets like they have in  50 gallon barrels.  Kind of a spigot.  That   s the kind of faucet that it had.  My mother didn   t even have a hose to water her flowers and things, but we  carried water in buckets to the flowers. She had flowers and all kinds of things  in the yard, but we had to carry a bucket.  When did you first have indoor bathrooms? Do you remember what year you  got it?  I was a teenager.  We didn   t have it on the farm.  We had it in Enid, but when we came back to Guymon then we rented houses.  We couldn   t always pay rent either and had to move. We had a bathroom in  27  Kite  Pate  Kite  Couch  Pate  Kite  Pate  Wood  Kite  Focks  Pate  Wood  Focks  Pate  Wood  Pate  Focks  Pate  Focks  Enid. Sometimes I   d have dreams. I   d dream that I was sitting on the potty in  that bathroom. I could just see that bathroom. That   s when I needed to get up  and go to the bathroom  laughter . Goodness, I shouldn   t be telling this.  Are you all getting tired of talking to us?  No, I   m not. I   d stay all day.  Was it hard for you to come back from Enid, from a bathroom to an outhouse?  Was it a disappointing transition?  It wouldn   t have made much difference to you.  When we lived on Roosevelt across from Delphine, we had an outhouse.  I just can   t imagine having to, in the middle of a snowstorm, run out to the  outhouse.  At night, you had a slop jar that you used inside.  There weren   t a lot of indoor bathrooms when we moved to Guymon. They  had the outdoor privies and dig a ditch. For Halloween, people would go and  turn them over. A lot of people got to where they moved their bathroom  forward. When the kids came to turn it over they   d step in  laughter .  That   s funny; that   s a good one.  His foster parents had the old Carter Hotel. They had an outhouse for that  hotel.  I didn   t remember that. In all the times I was down there I guess I never used  it. Now the Pike Hotel, that   s an old one.  The City Room, my sister and her husband ran that for a while.  The Chenaull Hotel, was that the Pike first?  It was the Pike. My mother and daddy operated that for a while.  And the Willoughby Hotel, at that time, was quite a place. You could go there  and get drinks.  It wasn   t there yet, when Mother and Daddy ran it.  Wasn   t your mother the first piano teacher in this country?  Probably.  She   s the first one that I ever knew of. She gave him lessons.  28  Pate  Kite  Pate  Couch  Wood  Kite  Wood  Pate  Kite  Weeks  Pate  Weeks  Couch  Kite  Focks  Oh yes, he took lessons. Half the town took lessons.  Well, we   re going to kind of bring this to an end. One of the concluding  questions we usually talk about it how you think going through that period  affected you. Are there some things you carry with you today because of  having grown up in those times?  It makes you want to hang on to everything you ever had. It does me. I never  want to get rid of anything because I might need it. I never sold a piece of  furniture that I didn   t wish that I had back  laughter . I had a loveseat, a  rocking loveseat that I just loved. It had foam rubber. I wore it down, and I  traded it off for something else. Years later, several like eight or nine, I bought  a trailer. I took it up to Memphis. I wished I   d had that loveseat. It would  have fit perfectly, because the trailer was only ten feet wide. It would have fit  right there between two little closets. So I went down to the furniture store and  asked them what they ever did with that loveseat. He said he thought they still  had it in the warehouse. I asked him how much he wanted for it, and he said  he   d let me have it for  25. I told him that was fine, because they gave me  50  when I traded it in  laughter . I still have it now in my living room.  I think it made people more appreciative of what we do have today. I think  we   re all a pretty strong bunch of people. I know my mother  Lula Wood  is  and Mrs. Weeks.  People   s morals have changed a lot. It   s hard for me to go along with some of  the things we have on television.  Do you think your morals came from living through the dust bowl?  People went by the rules of the Bible more than they do now.  They were instilled by our parents and grandparents.  What about you Mrs. Weeks? How did those 1930   s change you? What are  some things you carry with you because of that time?  Well, I don   t know. I think my kids think I   m stingy.  Frugal is a nice word.  I count pennies like I used to.  We all do.  Do you give them a nickel and tell them to go buy some jacks?  It makes me appreciate my parents and the work they did. Do you have time  for a story about my dad?  29  Kite  Focks  Couch  Focks  Kite  We have plenty of time.  It was after he had retired. He had lived in this house for a number of years  and I told him he needed new carpeting. He told me to have somebody come  down and make an estimate. I got a carpet man to come down and make an  estimate for his living room and his bedroom. The man told him how much it  would cost, and Dad said he   d call him. After he left, Dad said he couldn   t  buy that carpet. I asked him why not, and he said because he wouldn   t have  the money to leave us children. I told him he didn   t have a child that didn   t  have more than he had, who had worked as half as hard for it as he had. He sat  there a little while, and said to call the man back and we   ll buy the carpet. We  did, and I   ve always been very thankful that I stood up to him for once.  We didn   t do it often.  No we didn   t, not Charlie Steinkuehler.  I   d like to thank you all for taking your time to come. I   d like to look at those  pictures for a little bit if you don   t mind.  -------  -------
