 Lemons  Larason  So we   ll start with an easy one, your full name.  Margaret Larason. I was born Mary Margaret Manuel.  And where were you born?  In Catesby, Oklahoma.  And where is that?  Ellis County. Do you know where that is? It was a mile from the Texas line  on the south edge of the panhandle. That   s the 36, 30 line.  And in what year were you born, if you don   t mind telling me?  1912.  Where were your mother   s and father   s families from? That area?  No. Most Oklahomans came in here. My mother   s people came to Oklahoma  from Missouri. A general westward movement from, oh I don   t know, just a  general westward movement. My father   s people came to Oklahoma from  Kentucky through Kansas during the bleeding Kansas period. They all came  down here at the opening of the territories, the land rushes.  So that   s what brought them to Oklahoma, the land run then? What did your  father do?  My father was a rural mail carrier. We lived on a farm out there in Catesby.  Catesby   s just a little post office town. It never was much of a town. He  homesteaded out there, and we owned some land there   wheat land   but in  1918 he got this rural mail route, and carried the mail until he died in 1943.  Wow that   s a long time to be a mail carrier. Did your mother work, or was  she just at home?  No, she never was employed.  5  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  So how many brothers and sisters did you have?  I had three brothers, two older and one younger. Something that was a little  different, our family at that time at least, they sent all of us through college on  shoestrings. Not many kids went away from home to go to college at that  time. We were so far out in the country there was no bus route, so we all went  away from home to go to school at the age of 13 for high school.  Where did you go to high school?  Well, I went two years to Shattuck and then I went out to Panhandle A M,  where they had a full four year high school, at that time, right on the college  campus.  I did not know that.  It was certainly a service for people in the panhandle. I stayed there until  1930. Then I went to Alva, and got my degree there.  And what is your degree in?  I had a double major, English and speech. I got my degree in 1932. My two  older brothers and my younger one also, all got their degrees from OSU.  What made them decide to go to OSU?  Well, I guess that   s interesting; I don   t know for sure. My mother   s father and  a brother came to Oklahoma from Missouri. One brother settled in Stillwater,  and the other one near Pawnee. So my mother grew up in that area near  Pawnee. When she graduated from eighth grade she could have gone to live  with this uncle in Stillwater and go on to school, but her father didn   t think  there was much reason for women to get an education in those days, so she  didn   t. But there was a cousin who was a member of the second graduating  class from OSU, which I think, is kind of interesting. It may be one reason  why my brothers went there. But I ended up at Northwestern. I was very  young to be away from home all that time.  So how old were you when you finished your degree?  19.  I was going to say, you couldn   t have been very old. (Laughs)  When I started, no. No, I did eight years work in seven years, but I was still 19  when I got my degree.  So tell me a little bit about the house where you grew up. What did it look  like? How big was it?  6  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  It was a three-bedroom house, living room, nice big dining room which is  actually almost where we lived, out in the country. It was a stucco house, no  indoor plumbing, no electricity. So we grew up without many of the things that  we take for granted today.  How many people lived in that house for you?  It was a peculiar family in a way. My two brothers were ten and eight years  older than I, and the younger ten years younger. I don   t ever remember a time  that we all lived together. We never did because of the fact that we all had to  go away from home to school. My mother and father, and my younger brother  and I were there most of the time. My two older brothers were either at school  or had graduated and were working.  I could see that would be a little odd, to not have your whole family together.  What about at holidays, did they all come home? What was that like?  Well they were all home at Christmas at least, and my brothers always had  jobs, so there wasn   t much extra time for them, but they were home at  Christmas. Christmas was very   program at the local school, program at the  church and Christmas tree at the church. Little country church is still out  there. Catesby Church was built in 1905, and they   re still holding church in it.  I   m assuming you lived in a rather rural area.  Oh yeah.  Did your family farm?  My father owned his land, but he rented it to someone.  Did they have cattle on that land or did they have crops?  They grew wheat and cattle like they do now. Pasture, wheat in the winter.  What about neighbors that lived around you?  At the time I was growing up, there were families on practically every quarter  section of land. I have a friendship quilt that was pieced in 1933, by a little  Catesby club, people around in that area, I think there are 33 names on it, and  it represents 25 or 26 families. They all lived in a five-mile radius of Catesby  with a post office, church, school, and grocery store. Now there are not five  families in that whole area, so that   s what happened between 1933 and the  present time.  Are you in contact with any of those people that used to live by you?  Well, there are hardly any of them left. On that list  on the quilt , I think  there   s three people still alive. They were about my age. Of those three, one   s  7  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  in a rest home, and I don   t get in touch with the other one although she is still  living. So that was a long time ago. At that time there were a lot of people in  that area, but the dust bowl and the Depression took care of it. I have a hard  time separating the Depression and the dust bowl.  They do go right together, don   t they? So tell me, before we talk about what  the dust bowl was like; there   s your kitty cat.  That   s my tiger.  Before the dust storms started, what was a typical day like in your house?  Then we   ll talk about how that changed after the dust storms started to become  more regular.  As I say, my father didn   t do the actual farming. He always kept a cow and  raised a hog or two. We always butchered our own meat. We had our own  milk and eggs, and mother raised chickens. It wasn   t really a typical farm  family because we didn   t have to work in the fields like most farmers    kids  did. My parents were determined they were going to send us all away to  school. Mother just did the regular housework, and since I was only 13 when I  had to go away from home, I didn   t learn much about housework. I also went  to summer school part of the time, so I wasn   t home a lot.  I   d say not. So whenever you were at school, did you work?  No. My parents paid for board and room.  Like in a dorm, or where did you stay?  When I went to Panhandle, I lived in the dormitory like the college kids did.  And you were in high school?  I was in high school. In Shattuck I rented a room from some friends of my  parents. Paid board and room.  I've never known anyone who went away to high school like that. That   s  amazing to me.  I know. You wouldn   t have. There just weren   t many in our area who did  because for one thing they didn   t have the money and another they weren   t as  determined as my parents were that all of us were going to have an education.  The fact that my father had a well paying job for that day and time made the  difference. Of course, they went without a lot of things to send us to school.  That   s just what I was going to ask. What did they have to give up to send you  to school?  I think my mother wore the same old coat forever. I don   t think my mother  8  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  ever had a new coat until    We always had a newspaper, regardless of  anything we had a daily newspaper. We always had things to read. A few  things, we read them over and over again. (Laughs)  Did you have a favorite book when you were growing up?  Yeah, you always got prizes at school for books, and I remember one of the  first books that I was ever given, for the most head marks or something, the  Little Prudie books. There were seven, I think six Little Prudie books, and I  had all of them. The Bobbsey Twins. You probably never heard of them. The  Girl of the Limberlost. My dad liked western stories, so we had Zane Grey  books and William Lloyd Raines and I forget.  Do you still like to read?  Oh mercy, I read lot, always have.  Once you   re hooked on reading, it seems like just forever. Yeah, definitely. So  what would you say would be your fondest memory growing up?  It   s also tied up with school I guess. School was always lots of fun. We  always looked forward to school, and I looked forward to getting out of school  and having a job. A lot of memories of those times tied up with my parents. I  can   t point to any one particular time.  So were you at school when the dust storms hit?  I was in school until 1932. I got my degree in 1932, and when I graduated,  now this was in the middle of the Depression who   ll have to remember, and  somebody said,    How did the Depression affect somebody like you? They  didn   t know stocks and bonds.    And I said,    No, but they had to make a living  farming, and prices were so low. Sometimes you had crop failures, and there  wasn   t any money left.    I couldn   t get a job when I got my degree. I had a  lifetime teaching certificate, which is unheard of now, and I couldn   t get a job.  Some people said,    Well, you   re too young.    True, I was very young. Most of  them said,    Your father has a job. You don   t need one.    If one person in the  family, at that time, had a job, they could take care of you, and they wanted to  spread these jobs around. It was very discouraging.  So what did you do?  Well, I went to Amarillo and worked in a radio station for a while. Then I had  a brother who was a career Navy man in California, a lot of relatives out there.  I went out there, and spent almost a year, and did that same kind of work out  there. Then came home   I was just homesick, I guess. I came home to the  dust bowl. But I   d been gone in Amarillo and California for close to two  years. I came home, and the woman who taught one of the country schools  near us   it was about six or eight miles from my parents home out in north of  Shattuck   got married, so she immediately lost her job. So they came and  9  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  asked me to take it. It was just luck that I got that job that winter. That was in  the middle of the dust bowl, and I have written a story, which I   ll give you if  you help me remember. I think I may have a copy of it, if not I   ll send you  one. For a history of Shattuck, one of these family histories, I wrote a story  about teaching school that winter, which is as vivid a memory as I could give  you. It was just a little old country school out in the middle of a wheat field.  The dirt blew every day from every direction it seemed. It was pretty bad. It  was really bad.  There was just one big black Sunday that I remember very well, too. There  were other Sundays. There were other big storms. In a situation like that, you  know what I mean, by the middle of the section of wheat land the wind blew  practically every day, or it seemed like it did. In this little old schoolhouse the  dirt just came in through every window crack. Of course, I was my own  janitor. I built the fires. I had to clean the schoolhouse, and sometimes I  would take a whiskbroom and get the dirt out of the windowsills onto the floor  so I could sweep it up. The desks would be so covered with dirt, even during  the day that you could hardly write on them.  Did you write on the blackboard? How   d you do that with it being so dusty? I  would think you   d have to dust it off before you could even write on it.  Well, I don   t remember having trouble dusting the blackboard, but I do  remember trying to iron clothes.  What was that like?  You just gave up after a while.  I do that now (Laughs). I could only imagine if it was dusty.  But that was a terrible winter, and when that year was up they offered me that  school back. I think I got  75 a month. They offered me that school again,  and I said no. I didn   t want to have to teach another year under those  conditions.  How many students did you have in your class?  I had 12. Not very many and not all grades, of course. I   d gone to school  myself in a one-room schoolhouse myself with eight grades and maybe 30  kids, so I knew what it was like. But I got a job in Shattuck then working for  the newspaper; they offered me a job.  What did you do for the newspaper?  I did a little bit of everything there was to do. I wrote news, I wrote obituaries,  gathered local news.  Did you have to write any stories about dust bowl stuff and Depression  10  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  stories?  Yes, and that   s what I was doing when I was married. I was married January  1, 1936.  New Years Day.  Yes. My husband, Bert Larason, was a member of the legislature. He was  elected in 1934. In fact, the first time I ever voted, I voted for him, and he was  reelected in 1936. He was a member of the legislature when I married him.  He had grown up in Fargo, which is also in Ellis County just west of here. His  parents were also homesteaders out there in that area. They came from  Missouri. He was one of a large family, and at the time we were married he  and a brother had been living on the family farm out there. A married sister  and her husband were keeping house for them. Bert had a degree from OU. I  think Ham went to OSU; I   m not sure he finished. Anyway they knew how to  farm, but they also knew a lot of other things. They had established a stud  farm. Do you know what a stud farm is?  I think I do.  Well, they had a couple of stallions when we were first married, and a jack.  They served brood mares. Somebody said,    Well how come you made so  much money on horses at that time?    We had several horses at that time, and I  didn   t understand it either. There were tractors in all the area in 1936, but gas  was so high, crops were so poor people couldn   t afford to pay for their tractors  or to run them, either one. So they went back to horses and mules. It was a  thriving business for a while. One of the peculiar things that I remember when  Bert and I were first married living in this great big old house out in the  country, there must have been a dozen tractors and other types of mechanized  machinery parked in the pasture. I started to say combines. I don   t know  whether they had combines then or not, I   m not sure. They were parked out  there, and I said,    Well what are they doing out there?    They were tractors  that had been foreclosed on. People couldn   t pay for them, so companies came  and got them. They just put them out there. They were there for years. That  was typical of what happened in this country in 1936. Of course, there again,  after we were married, Bert and I weren   t typical because we had some money  and property which a lot of people didn   t have.  You got married in 1936. When did you meet Bert? You voted for him in  1934, but did you know him then?  Yes, I   d met him before. As I said before, not very many people went to  college from those areas, so we all knew one another. The kids from Shattuck,  Follett, Texas, Gage, Arnett, and Woodward all congregated more or less. I  met him at Gage Artesian Beach at a dance. There was a dancehall there.  On Saturday night it was open to everybody, and I never went on Saturday  nights. On Wednesday nights in the summer the college kids all congregated  there. That   s where I met him. I think I was a junior in college. He was still  11  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  in college at OU. It was not love at first sight. I thought he was terribly  arrogant. He thought I was a terrible flirt (Laughs). We had known each other  quite a while. When I was still working at this newspaper office he came in  one day, I think it was the Farmers   Merchants picnic in Shattuck, and as  politicians do, he came in with the speaker who was there for the picnic.  Anyway he came into the newspaper office and remembered me, and said,     Let   s go drink a coke,    so we drank a coke. One thing led to another. That  was in August, and we were married in January.  But not love at first sight?  No, no, not quite love at first sight (Laughs), although, he remembered me and  I remembered him.  But maybe not in a good way (Laughs). Did the two of you have children?  Yes, we lost our first child in 1938, and then we have three children living.  Tim Larason is a lawyer in Oklahoma City, actually a very successful tax  attorney. The next child Anne Larason Schneider got her Ph.D. at Indiana  University. Tim got his law degree at OCU, and his undergraduate degree at  OU. Anne went to OSU, and then to Indiana for her Ph.D., and is now at  Arizona State as Dean of the College of Public Programs out there. Anne and  her husband are divorced. Tim and his wife have two children, and they still  live in Oklahoma City. The third, Linda, went to OU and finished at  Northeastern State in Tahlequah. She married Drew Edmondson when they  were still in school and finished over there. She got her master   s degree in  social work from OU, later. They live in Oklahoma City. Of course, Drew is  the Attorney General. She works part time. She heads a nonprofit deal, the  Oklahoma Alliance for Better Care of the Dying and the Oklahoma  Association for Health Ethics. I may not have that title exactly right. That   s  what she   s interested in. She was a clinical social worker, and then got into  this type of work later.  And when were they born? Were they born during this Depression time or  later?  No. Tim was born in 1939, Anne 1941, and Linda after the war in 1947. My  husband went to ROTC at OU, and was a reserve officer. He was called for  active duty in April of 1941, before Pearl Harbor. He thought he would just be  gone a year. He was obligated as a reserve officer. They asked if he would be  willing to do a year   s active duty. Well, yes he would, and then he thought it   d  be over, but then of course Pearl Harbor came. He said,    I don   t know when  I   ll be home.    So I had those two little children, and I was living out there on  the farm, but there was no way to live there a long time with me trying to run  it. I couldn   t run it, somebody else had to. I moved to Woodward, and lived  here until the war was over. He came out of the war in the fall of 1945,  actually he was released in 1946 as a colonel. Anne was two months old when  he went into the service, and she celebrated her fifth birthday after he got  home. He was overseas actually in the Pacific Theatre two years and a half.  12  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  We didn   t see him during that time.  And that   s when you moved to Woodward was when he was in service?  Well, we moved back to the farm then, immediately after he came home, and  lived there until we moved over here 20-some years ago. We had a nice big  home out in the country.  Yes, we talked to Marcella Bynum this morning, and she was telling us about  the tornado.  Well, the tornado took our farm home, too. We rebuilt out there, but we did  have a nice home. Hard times then, too. Yeah, Marcella is a friend of mine.  Well, let   s turn back to the dust bowl for a second. You   re out at this country  school and the dust storms are blowing around. What did it look like when  you could see a dust storm coming? Before it   s all dusty and you can see it on  the horizon, what does it look like?  Well, I   ll tell you about the Black Sunday. When I was teaching, I boarded  with a family near the school, but would be home on weekends. That Sunday  afternoon we were reading in this big dining room. There were windows on  the east side that we had not covered with things to keep the dirt out. My  father put tarpaper over all of the west and south windows in the house. That  was one way that you kept the dirt out, you   d take tarpaper and lay it out and  nail it. Anyway, these windows we left open there in the dining room. We  were reading, and my little brother came running up to the house. He   d been  out at the barn. He had a pony, a saddle horse. The pony came running to the  barn like there was really something wrong. Leroy looked up and saw this  huge black cloud, so he came running to the house to tell us that was  something was on the way. We   d never seen anything like that before. It was  just a huge cloud, black. When it finally got there, there were rabbits and birds  and coyotes running through our yard ahead of the storm. Suddenly we  couldn   t see those windows. It was absolutely completely dark, completely  black. I don   t know how long it lasted.  How long did it feel like it lasted; a long time, or did it feel like it went really  fast?  No, it lasted a long time. It lasted hours, as I remember. Bert said later that he  was on his way to Oklahoma City, and got caught in that storm. Of course, it  was all farther west of where he lived. Anyway, that was the Black Sunday.  One of things you said was how did the people cope with getting dirt out of the  house? They boarded up their windows. Lots of people used wet sheets to  keep the dust out. I don   t know that we ever did, but I know that in the school  house, it just came in like there wasn   t any protection at all. I   ll tell you about  one time, a friend of mine also taught out there in the country near me. She  boarded out, but I had a real nice place to stay, and a real good cook. Nina  would come over occasionally during the week to stay all night with me. I  13  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  think as much to get a good meal as anything else.  And Nina is your friend that teaches?  Yeah. So this particular day she had come over, and it had been a pretty day.  There were nice days mixed in with all those. I don   t want it to seem like  every day was a terrible storm. It had been a nice day, so that night we took  baths, we put cold cream on our face, and we went to bed. We woke up the  next morning   we had left the window open, like I said it was a beautiful day,  and we were both black. The dust had come in the night, not enough noise to  wake us up, settled in on us, and the shape of our heads were on the pillow,  black all around it. We had dirt all over our faces.  How did you clean that off? I can only imagine.  Yes, it wasn   t easy, as well as I remember. There were times that we would go  to Shattuck then, she had a car, she   d come past and pick me up, and we   d be  covered with dust when we got to town. We   d go in for a coke. It   d be a  beautiful day there, but it   d been blowing out in the country. I can   t tell you  exactly what the dust bowl was like, but it was terrible. The sand that would  be drifted up along the fence rows; clear over the fences, if the farm machinery  was left out sometimes it would almost be covered up with sand.  You   d have to remember where you left it so you could go dig it out again I  guess.  They would take graders and grade those along the fence lines to get that dirt  out of there. I don   t know how people lived through it, and of course, lots of  them left.  Did you know anybody, any of your friends that left?  Oh yeah, there were a lot of people out there that left.  We always hear about them going out to California. Did they go to  California?  Well, I expect most of them went to California.  Did any of them come back?  No, I don   t think many of them came back.  I guess it turned out okay in California.  Probably did. Probably raised the IQ of both places. I don   t know who said  that, somebody did.  I think it   s interesting, you were telling me about your brother and the signs  14  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  from animals. Were there any other signs that you knew a dust storm was  coming? Could you ever just kind of tell just from the way the weather was, or  was it just a complete surprise?  Yes, you could tell. That day was a surprise, but ordinarily you could tell.  How would you know?  The wind would be blowing.  Oh, yeah, yeah. Here comes another one.  Here comes another one. Of course, it didn   t take much. The farming  methods have changed so much since then because of that. It couldn   t happen  now, not quite like it did then.  One of the questions that we have on here is, what do you think, from the  people that you know and talk with at that time, was the general consensus of  the cause of the dust storms?  Well, of course the drought. They broke out land that should have been left in  grass. We all know that. A lot of it   s been put back to grass through the CRP  program. Poor farming methods and they cultivated until the soil was just fine  silt. They don   t do that anymore either. You   re not supposed to cultivate that  way.  Learned a lot about farming after that.  Yes, a lot about farming. OSU has certainly done a wonderful job in that area.  Well what made you and your husband stay in Oklahoma?  Well, Bert was one of seven children, three boys and four girls, and he   s the  only one who seemed to want to come back here. He knew how to farm.  When he first got out of school he thought about going to law school, but I  guess there wasn   t money and maybe he wasn   t quite the temperament, but at  any rate, he had a couple of jobs in Oklahoma City. For GMAC, I don   t  remember what the others were. I just heard him talk about it. He didn   t like  it. He knew he could make a living farming, in spite of hard times because he  knew how to farm and he was a good manager. So he decided to come back to  the farm after we were married. When we were married we began to buy land.  There was a lot of family land available, which helped. His father was ready  to quit farming, and so we bought some of his land. We gradually bought a lot  of land in the 1930s,    40s, all along in there. There was always land for sale.  They learned that you couldn   t make a living on a quarter section of land. You  had to have more land. There was land available to buy, and Bert never  missed an opportunity; if it joined him, he wanted to buy it. He was a good  manager and a good farmer. He knew that he could make a good living there  in spite of everything. So that   s why we stayed.  15  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  So what would you say constituted hard times for your family then? Like you  said your family is a little bit atypical.  You mean for Bert and me? Well after the tornado; that cost us a lot. It tore  up our house, we had to buy a house in Gage, and live. It was two months  before Linda was born. We had to find me a place. We bought a house in  Gage moved over there. That   s when I went back to teaching. There was a  vacancy in the English department, and they asked me if I   d take it just before  school started. Linda was born in June, and I took it. We were trying to make  every dime we could. Of course, Bert was still a reserve officer, and he had  three months active duty in Fort Sill. I will remember I got  1800 that year  teaching school; he got  1800 for three months active duty at Fort Sill. But  every dime we could get a hold of we needed. We just gradually came out of  it, I guess. In the 1950   s there was another drought, but we always managed to  keep our heads above water. As I said, Bert was a good farmer and a good  manager.  Sounds like he must have been to get through all that.  We had quite a bit of land, still have.  So what would you say is your most vivid memory of this dust bowl, depression  era?  Well I guess being dirty. (Laughter)  With the cold cream on your face. That   s the best story.  That   s certainly a vivid memory. And teaching school that winter, that was  certainly an ordeal. These kids in my school district were poor kids, and of  course we all took our lunch to school. This one family just plain didn   t have  enough to eat. If they had anything in their lunch box, a time or two I began to  realize they just had some bread in their lunch box. So when I would go home  on Sunday my dad would take me back to school on Monday morning, and I   d  have a pot of vegetable soup or something to put on top of the old heating  stove. I began to make soup every once in a while for them. Well the county  commissioner found out what I was doing, and began to give us commodities  for the school kids for lunch, canned stuff. It wasn   t very good, but it was  something to eat. And where I boarded, they would often send a gallon of  milk, and we   d make cocoa on top of the stove. Those kids were poor. When  the wind was blowing I wouldn   t let the little boys go out to the coal shed. I  was afraid they   d get lost. On bad days I didn   t let them out until somebody  came to get them. Those were very vivid memories.  Oh, I   d say. How were you able, as a teacher, to keep the kids focused on  schoolwork with this storm going on outside?  I guess they were used to it. They were used to it, and we managed. I had four  beginners, first graders. I   m not real sure how I taught them to read, but I did.  16  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  They could all read these four little boys. Later when I finally did go back to  teaching full time, after my kids were in school, I taught 25 years as a high  school English teacher and school librarian in Fargo, and then over here   Woodward .  You made a career of teaching.  It was such a hopeless time. It was kind of like the war. You didn   t know  when the war was going to be over. There wasn   t any end to it; you couldn   t  see any end to it. It just got to feeling hopeless, when is this ever going to be  over. That was the way the dust bowl days went.  I guess that kind of leads to a question though. How did you get up every day  and get through your day when you feel like that?  Well, what else is there to do? I guess you just do what you have to do.  Well, would you say that the dust bowl experience or the Depression  experience has left a permanent mark on you as a person?  It certainly influenced the kind of person I am.  In what way?  Well, I certainly don   t believe in throwing your money away. I think I  appreciate very much all of the opportunities we had. Not everybody had the  opportunities I had. I appreciate everything that ever happened to me, and it  made me a different person. The war made me a different person.  Do you think it made you in a better way? Do you think it made you a better  person?  I think so.  Well, is there anything else you want to add? Anything I didn   t talk about that  when you looked through the questions we sent you were like    Well, why  didn   t they talk about this?     Well, I   ll probably think of some.    What did you do for fun and  entertainment?    Well, we made our own.  Like what did you do? You said you met your husband at a dance.  Yes. As I said, the college kids all congregated in the summer, but we had  dates, of course. I   d always have boyfriends. We sometimes went to movies,  but we played a lot of bridge. We did that kind of stuff. We made our own  entertainment. We certainly didn   t have the kind of entertainment we have  now. I think kids are so spoiled now. It just worries me.  17  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  What would you do to change that?  I don   t know. Our children grew up on a farm like we did. There was always  work for them to do, and they knew that we needed their help. Tim learned to  drive a tractor when he was far from old enough. He was a big boy. We  always hired high school kids to help. We had a lot of farmland, and in those  days the tractors weren   t so big. We always had a house full of kids all  summer long. Not only at harvest time, but you plowed and plowed again.  We always had kids working all summer. Our children learned how to work,  and responsibility. It   s awful hard to make work for kids in these days.  Carrying out the trash doesn   t quite cut it.  It   s not quite the same, huh?  It   s not the same. It   s not easy to raise children now. Of course maybe I look  at it the wrong way. It was easier for us. Our children turned out well.  It sounds like you have a lot to be proud of.  I am awfully proud of my children. I don   t know if there   s anything else that I  particularly wanted to talk about or not.  Well, we covered most of the major issues that we had on our list.     Did you receive any type of assistance?    No, we didn   t. Now at the  beginning of the Depression one of my brothers worked for a pipeline  company. Some big company went broke which left him out of a job, and he  was home briefly without a job in about 1933 or    34. About that time they  organized these road crews to make work, WPA. He was a time keeper, a  supervisor on a group of people like that in the county for a brief period of  time before he went back and got another job with another pipeline company.  He went to work for the Williams company over at Tulsa. He worked for them  many years, formed his own pipeline company, and was a very successful pipe  liner. It was hard times for him too at that time. My oldest brother was in the  Navy, and made a career of it. He stayed in the Navy.  When did he join the Navy? Before World War II, I guess?  Yes. I can   t remember when. I was born in 1912, and I was about 15 or 16  when he joined the Navy. He went through pilot training. He was a bomber  pilot. That was rough. A lot of people wanted in. Not many made it through  their training, but he did, and then stayed in the Navy. Finally he changed; he  said there   s never an old bomber pilot. He changed and got a commission. He  ended up captain in the Navy. I know it was awfully hard for him to come  home to that. At one time my grandfather lived with us for a short time. That  brings up another whole deal in a way. There was no provision for old people.  If you didn   t have family there was no place to go.  Just a second before you go on. Your grandfather is living with you and your  18  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  Larason  parents or you and your husband?  It was before I was married. My mother and father were able to keep him until  my mother became ill. No other person in her family was able to keep him so  he went to the Masonic home over in Guthrie. That   s a complete change from  the way things are now. There was no type of public assistance for old people,  no social security.  Did you have any other relatives that came and stayed for an extended period  of time, or any non-relatives?  I think Bert   s family did. Bert   s father always took in any stray that came  along. Someone came and stayed a long time, I think. Political views have  certainly changed. My father and mother were republicans, but every one of  us kids registered democrat.  Why do you think that is?  Well, because of Franklin D. Roosevelt, primarily. When I registered to vote,  my dad changed his registration. So we all became democrats.  Just because of the Depression?  Well, I think primarily because of that. Hoover was just a dirty word. Of  course it wasn   t just his fault, we realize now.  But it didn   t matter at the time when you registered to vote, I guess.  No it didn   t matter at the time. I remember in 1932, Roosevelt was elected and  closed all the banks. I was a senior in college. Maybe there was a glimmer of  hope down the way. We pinned our hopes to Roosevelt.  Were you satisfied with Roosevelt or disappointed in Roosevelt by the time he  left, by the time that he died?  No, satisfied with him. I was afraid everything was going to go to pot when he  died and Truman became president.  You and a lot of people I think.  We were almost ashamed of him  Truman  sometimes, he was so corny.  Historically, he redeemed himself in later years.  Your political views changed you just explained; what about views toward the  environment, and just the idea of mother nature after the dust bowl and  Depression, did that change?  Well, you better take care of it  the environment . A healthy respect for  mother earth. Yes, it changed. Of course my husband was always interested  19  Lemons  Larason  Lemons  in all kinds of soil conservation projects, and he always made farm programs  work for him. He knew how to do things. I can   t think of anything else I  wanted to tell you in particular.  Well, we appreciate you talking with us. I feel a very important project for us  to do. I   m glad that there are people like you willing to participate, and talk  with us about their memories of the dust bowl.  Well, it was a hard time to live through, but I think the ones who stayed here  and stuck it out were better off than if we had gone away. You never know  what would have happened if you   d taken another course.  Well, that   s true, and I guess we   re not supposed to know.  -------  -------
