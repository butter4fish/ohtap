 Lemons  Pitzer  Mackey  We   re at the Cimarron Heritage Center in Boise City, Oklahoma, January 9,  2001. You can introduce yourselves here.  I   m Willa May Sanders.  Just like that sounds.  Faye Pitzer.  And do you want to state your name?  Helen Cole Mackey. Helen.  Thanks so much for coming out and meeting us today. It   s nice of you to take  time out of your schedules to do this. We appreciate it. I hope you think this  project is as important as we think it is, to get this information down,  preserved and saved and kept for the future. We were just going to start off  with general information. Maybe you could tell us when and where you were  born. We   ll go around like that, if that   s all right.  I was born in out southeast of Boise City here, in the Garlington community,  October 5, 1922.  Are you ready for me?  Sure.  I   m Faye Pitzer, and I wasn   t born here. I was born in Kingfisher County,  Oklahoma. I came out here when I was 15 years old. Do you need anything  else?  Do you want to give us your birthday? You don   t have to.  Oh, I forgot that. I was born March 1, 1912.  You   re just a pup (laughter). I   m Helen Mackey and I was born May 30, 1911,  in Grand Island, Nebraska. I came to Cimarron County March, 1931 with my  5  Lemons  Pitzer  Kite  Mackey  Lemons  Mackey  Lemons  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Kite  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  parents. I was not married.  What we   d like each of you to do, we can start with the dust bowl if you want.  Tell what it was like then, what a typical day was like for you at that time in  the thirties.  The wind didn   t really start in    35, it started before. The wind just kept  gradually coming up each year. Then it   d go down just about dark, sundown,  lots of times, and sometimes it wouldn   t.  So you remember it starting in the early thirties then, before    35. About the  time she got here?  When we got here we came on the train from northeastern Missouri, Macon  County. When we got here it rained and it rained and it rained and it rained.  We could hardly get off the sidewalks. Then, it just quit like that and it started  getting dry.  What brought your family to Cimarron County?  A job. My father was in groceries. He came out here to be with my mother   s  uncle, who had a grocery store here. Then he became the manager of JM  Miracles grocery chain as a supervisor, and traveled from these 14 stores. He  didn   t like that; he just wouldn   t be away from home. They said,    If you   ll  stay with the company we   ll give you this store here in Boise City, so he did  that. So we settled here.  You came with the rain (laughing).  Maybe they caused the rain to quit (laughing).  It was beginning to get dry then though.  What year was that, Helen?  We came in March 1931, when it was rainy, and then it just leveled off and got  dryer and dryer and dryer. I remember the first time I ever saw a combine. I  got to ride on it. I was 18.  What about you, Mrs. Pitzer, were you born here?  No, I was born in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma.  What brought you here?  I came here because my father was here for just about four or five years, and  then I had a sister here that married a boy that was born and raised here. He  got off down at Kingfisher County, and they brought her out here. They said  she just cried and cried at first.  6  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Mackey  Kite  Lemons  Sanders  I cried for weeks.  She thought this was the most desolate place. When I came out later, quite a  bit later, I never cried. I was in high school and played basketball, and got pep  club organized. The football field was out where the hospital is now. I went  to live over where my father and stepmother was, and graduated over there.  Bonnie Hoxy was my real good friend. She had me to write a lot of those pep  yells down. She was going to try to carry on after I left. Just about three years  ago she came by my house and stayed that evening. We went to the school  reunion and she brought me that little book. It had got wet, and it was about  that big and about that thick. You can hardly read part of it (laughter).  Your old cheers and the different things that you   d written down?  Yeah, old cheers. Down at Kingfisher they were more organized. When I  came out here, they didn   t have anything like that.  I remember Bonnie because Uncle Hill, Judge Hill, said,    Helen, there   s a girl  out there just your age.    I said,    What   s her name?    when they knew we were  coming out here. He said,    Bonnie Showalter,    and I thought, that   s the most  peculiar name (laughter). But I finished high school in Quincy, Illinois in    29.  You came here when you were 15?  About 17.  I was trying to get it straight.  You were 15  in reference to Ms. Sanders .  So you cried and cried when you got here.  I left all my friends, and I had had just one year of college. I had a real  boyfriend that I hated to leave; you know how that is (laughing). Yes, it was  different than anything I   d ever seen. I cried for five weeks. I had a cousin  over at Clayton, and she said,    Helen, come over and stay with me for a  while.    So, I went over and stayed with her family, and I forgot all about  everything. I came back, and I was the happiest person in the world (laughter).  I   ve loved it ever since. I still call Macon, Missouri my home, but I wouldn   t  go back for the world.  That   s a nice ending to that story.  What was it like for you? What did your family do?  Well, we lived on a farm. I had three older sisters, and I was the fourth girl; 18  months later came a little baby brother. He had dark eyes and dark hair, and  he was spoiled rotten. I say I always fought for everything that I got. I think it  was in about 1920 when dad got a bunch of pure-bred Holstein, so we had all  of that. We milked. Those were the days you milked.  7  Kite  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Lemons  Sanders  Milked by hand.  By hand. He built onto the barn stalls. I think there were ten stalls, but we  milked all the way from 15 to 20 head every evening.  I never learned to milk (laughing).  That was my life right there. Of course, we had the old separator. It was my  place to wash that separator and get it cleaned up, but I had to walk to the  house and get some hot water to do it in. We never could go any place without  having the milking done, the calves fed, because we gave the calves    skim  milk, and the pigs had to be fed, and of course, the separator had to be washed  and all that put up. We didn   t get to go anywhere until that was done. We  didn   t go to the house for supper until all of that was done. We had one of  those big old coal stoves, very similar to that, but ours had a place on one side  that had had water, a reservoir. We never really were in want for anything to  eat because we had eggs. Dad and Mama came from Missouri out here, and  Grandmother lived in town. Whenever Wesley got out of World War II,  Grandpa had died. He was stacking bales and just fell dead sometime.  Anyhow, she had moved down into town then where she kept schoolteachers.  They boarded them in those days. They had a bedroom, and then she would  feed them breakfast, dinner, and supper. That was her living. She always  enjoyed going there. What else shall I tell them (laughing)? I   ll tell you this  while I think of it. It was just Daddy usually. Sometimes we had a hired hand,  but it wasn   t all the time. I   d milk just about as fast as Dad, and Denton would  just piddy-diddle along.  Denton, was that your little brother?  Yeah. Until he wanted to go some place, and then he could milk just as fast as  Dad or I (laughter). But, there you go again, he was the only boy, so that was  his privilege.  At that time that my two older sisters, I think Gladys went to college for a  while, Opal was in high school and then married a schoolteacher, and Iris, she  finally went down to where Opal lived, so that just left Denton and I to help  with the chores.  We   d go to town on Saturday evening to get groceries. Dad would usually get  enough apples or a banana or something that we could eat on the way home  because we lived twelve miles out. In those days they didn   t zip back and  forth (laughter).  While I think of it, we didn   t have too many relatives here. It was just  grandmother that lived in town, and that was about it. Dad built our house  where we lived. At that time we had on the north side a larger room, and then  you walked into another one, which was mama and daddy   s bedroom, and then  there was a bedroom across here. Then you could go on into the kitchen, and  then there was a little hall up and down, and then there was another one, and  8  Lemons  Sanders  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  that was my bedroom. I can remember laying there on that bed, putting my  head up on that window, and looking out at what was going on outside, if  anything was going on outside. Dad finally, he had six quarters, that was 960  acres, and Denton and I always helped cut the milo. Evidently it was pulled by  horses. We   d cut it off with a knife and throw it up, and that was a way. He  had some kind of a machine there in the same barn that the milk was being  done in. After it dried good and all, he could get it separated.  We didn   t have any plumbing. Of a morning, dad would get up and make a  fire in the stove. Now we did have some coal most of the time, but a lot of it  was from old chips. There was a big ranch to the south of us there close by the  Beaver River and all, and we   d go down there and pick up those old cow  chips and throw them in there.  Is this sounding familiar over here (laughter)?  That was a lot of our fuel right there.  Mrs. Pitzer, what was a typical day for you like out here when you got here?  Farming?  I was married in    31, and we lived with his folks a year and a half. He helped  his brother with the dray business, what they called when the depot brings stuff  up. He worked at that and helped his dad build some houses. His dad had a  restaurant down here where Pam   s is at now, the variety store. He sold that  and got him some money.  It was kind of short in those days (laughter).  Alfred got a chance to get some land out west here. He bought a Caterpillar  tractor for  200, but he had to go to the bank to borrow it. We got out there,  and we   d want to come to town. The road would be open on the south, but  then we   d go to town and the wind would blow all day. It would blow that  little road   they weren   t wide like they are now. They were just more or less  cow trails. A little bigger than that. Then we   d have to go around the north  way and come in from the north because we couldn   t get in through the south.  Maybe the next morning the wind would have the dirt blown out of the road  where we could go south again.  You never knew which way you were going.  No, no. You didn   t know which way. The chickens, it would just blow.  You   d have to get up early to get your washing out, unless you went to town. I  came to town to my sister   s. Her husband worked for the utility company  then, for the Boise City Utility Company, and she had a washing machine and  she had some little kids, so I   d hang her clothes out and then I   d take mine  home and take mine home and hang mine out. That would help us both out.  We tried to raise some chickens. We moved out in this old house, it was an  old house and it had been built into a lean-to on the side. We stuffed the  9  Sanders  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Kite  Mackey  Sanders  windows with whatever we could find to stuff them with. You didn   t have  clothes like you did now. Maybe we had sugar sacks, and we   d make sheets  out of flour sacks. We   d wet them and hang them up over the windows. We   d  stuff the windows full of whatever we could get to stuff them with. We never  turned our bed to the window because that still might blow in on us, you know.  We always put the bed on the other side of the window.  We usually had a north wind if we had any dirt or anything like that.  And the chickens, what few chickens we did raise, it would get so dark that  they   d go in the chicken house before night because they thought it was night  and time to go on the roost. They   d be sitting on the roost.  In the middle of the day  laughing .  Yeah, well about two o   clock or three. Then we finally got a pig, and raised  some little pigs. You just kind of accumulate. Then my mother came out, she  was a teacher down by Kingfisher, she came out, and she thought we should  have a cow. The Chevrolet Garage fellow brought a cow or two in; he wanted  to trade it for a car, so she bought this cow for us for  25. She was a jersey  cow.  So the garage took the cows, gave him the car, and sold you the cows.  Yeah, he sold us a cow. One cow.  I don   t think they do that anymore. I don   t think you could trade a cow for a  car today.  I don   t suppose you had to pay much more, I don   t know. You probably did.  The other guy did for his car. That   s all a cow cost us. In another year or two,  Mama came out, and she thought we needed another cow. Her and Alfred  went and bought one from the Chevrolet Garage again. We just got started  with cattle, and then were able to buy cows.  You left the town and went out to the country in    31.  No, about    37 we went out there. We were in town here.  You were in town until    37?  Yes.  Then you moved into town about    31.  Yeah, I came from northeastern Missouri in March 1931. It was a rainy  season, but it started drying up.  Grandma and Grandpa lived on that quarter where we live now, of course.  That was at the time that they could homestead a quarter and they   d get it. He  10  Kite  Sanders  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Lemons  Mackey  Lemons  Kite  was a streetcar conductor in Kansas City, so they came out here and they built  a dugout. Gladys, the oldest one, she was three. Mama and Gladys stayed in  that dugout and Dad went back to Kansas City so they   d have money. She   d  maintain the homestead. They were about six miles or maybe four diagonally  across from where Grandma lived. Gladys and Mama, a three-year old, mind  you, they   d walk up there to Grandma   s and stay a while. Then they   d walk  back.  One night a neighbor girl was staying all night with Mama and Gladys, and  they heard the most awful thing, like the roof was going to fall in. Mama  always had a gun, she knew how to do it, and she was a good shooter, so she  got up and went to the window. It was a bunch of the neighbor   s mules were  standing up on their heels, pounding the roof of the dugout.  One other time, I can remember this, she forgot to shut the chicken door. You  didn   t shut the chickens until it was dark or all the chickens got in. She went  out there and got right there, and old Bessie the cow had gotten out and was  laying there. She got up and just aaahhhh and just scared mama (laughter).  We   ve heard quite a bit about that. He   d  dad  come back from Missouri ever  so often, every chance he got to stay a while. He had an old Rio truck, one of  the first trucks, and he took stuff for the neighbors. You might say trucked;  that   s what we   d call it today would be trucking. He had an old Rio truck, I   ve  still got the piano that he bought in Elkhart that they felt like Gladys ought to  learn to play the piano or to do something like that. To say they were just  setting down and playing music, dad couldn   t, but our family all loved music.  So, I have that piano now, but it   s so heavy I can   t move it out to clean behind  it or anything else. Wesley   s getting so old, too, that he can hardly get it out.  Anyhow, we still have that old piano, and it still has a good tune to it.  What a neat piece of family history. It   s a neat thing to have to remember  those times.  Oh yes. We hope that someone will really like to have it, even though it is  hard to move around.  Let   s move into the dust bowl period.  I was going entertainment, but that   s okay.  Let   s go there.  Okay. Mrs. Mackey I was going to start with you. What did you do for  entertainment?  Oh my goodness. You didn   t want to know about     You can tell us whatever you want to.  Yes, we   re just throwing out questions (laughter).  11  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Lemons  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Well, there were about 25 of us around here. Some we dated and some we  didn   t; some we would and some we wouldn   t sometimes. We were in just a  gang. One of the girls, her father had the hotel, so we   d go in there in their  dining room and play pig. Do you know what pig is? You put your finger on  your nose and then you   d be it the next time. It was just silly, just terrible.  And Tiddly Winks, and marbles all over the living room floor.  I   m afraid we   re going to have to ask you to describe pig.  We got down on the floor, and let me see how did we do it?  Could you act it out for us here? (Laughter)  I   d have to crawl on the floor, and I   m not going to do that (laughter). Then  we   d crawl around on the floor. I don   t know just what we did, but anyway if  you saw something or did something, I can   t remember what it was, we had to  put our hand on our nose. The last one that put their hand on their nose was  the pig (laughter). Wasn   t that fun? It was exciting. Then we had a golf  course out here, and of course, it was knee deep in sand, we played that.  You played golf in the deep sand? That   s about how I play golf anyway   It wasn   t really sand then, it was the sod. But we had fun. In the wintertime,  we played all winter, we painted our golf balls green and red so we could see  them in the snow. Later we had a swimming pool. I had acute Brise Disease,  and my doctor told me to get a hobby and do it every day. I chose swimming.  I went swimming every day, and I was just like a black boy (laughter). I was  just as black as the ace of spades. I didn   t burn. I just got black. You swam  all the time, too, didn   t you?  Yeah, down by the elevator? That   s where I went. They had swimming pools  for people that were privately owned, and they let people swim in them.  That was before my time. Then we danced and square danced. We   d usually  go to about three dances a week. We went in droves, and just had fun.  Did you have live bands playing at dances?  Yes. We had a band right here in town. They had five or six players, and they  went and played every night. One played a violin and played the violin for  square dancing. What else did we do?  Did Ace play with them then?  No, he and somebody else, I don   t know who it was, played. Alfred had his  own. He had the Sapinfield Boys and     I said Ace, Ace Pitzer. He used to play his fiddle, and Alfred, my husband,  played there.  I didn   t remember them playing.  12  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Lemons  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Mackey  Mackey  Kite  He played the guitar, banjo.  No, that was before my time.  Oh.  Are you a big dancer, too? Did you square dance or go to the weekly dances?  We did both. And swim.  That   s where I met Alfred. Bonnie Hoxie and five of us went out to Ravel   s  pit.  Alfred is your husband, I guess?  Every Sunday we went out to the hills. There was Flag Springs out there, and  we took our weenies and buns and had picnics. And we went to Kenton. After  the dances we   d go to Kenton and have breakfast, sunrise breakfast. Then  we   d come home. I went to church and Sunday school, but most of the rest of  them didn   t.  We made our own way. I had a brother here, he was two years older than I  was, and he came and was here for a while. He married a hometown girl.  Then I got married in 1934. We bought our first home up there in north Boise  City. They   re building onto that now, Swints have it now. They   re building  that on, you know.  What we use to call the Old Miller House?  Was that your house? The Old Miller House was your house?  Yes. We bought it from Mrs. Miller. We borrowed money from Rex Palson,  and paid him  25a month. We bought secondhand furniture. The house was  just half built then. They had left the baseboards up like that so we could put  floor under it, and so we put      End of the tape .  We had to sell our business because we thought my husband was going to war.  Then we moved to Tulsa for a while. Then the bank called us and wanted to  know if we   d take the bank at Keyes because Buster had come from Rocky  Ford, Colorado, my husband, to work in a bank. He didn   t like the bank, so he  went to the garage. So he worked in a garage when we left and went to  Kansas. Then we came back to Keyes, and were back here at the bank 15  years. Then we came to Boise City. I stayed here about 45 years in that  house, and I just moved out of it three or four months ago (laughing).  45 years in the same house.  13  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Kite  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Yes. The dust storm days was when we bought our house. I can remember  getting a meal, we hadn   t been married very long, and I learned to make my  food in one pot, soups and stews and casseroles and things like that. We   d sit  down at the table, I helped Buster down at the bank, and we   d sit down at our  table, he   d get the table ready and I   d put the food on, and then when we   d  dish it up we   d put the lid back on so the dirt wouldn   t get in.  In the food?  In the food. The dust would lay in the middle of the night. It wouldn   t blow  until about ten o   clock the next morning. That would give you time just to  clean your house up, and then it   d start blowing. Our window sills, we had  built on and made it kind of tight, and our window sills would get dust in them  and the dust would fall off the windowsill. Didn   t they? The dust would fall  off the windowsills, we had that much dust coming in the house.  We   ve heard a lot about dust getting into food and trying as hard as you could  to keep it out.  We covered ours.  The people that lived in the country had it pretty rough.  We slept in the basement, so we didn   t have any trouble sleeping.  We didn   t have so much in the house because the house that dad built had no  north windows on it. The kitchen was back in there, so it was kind of  protected. We didn   t have that. I will tell you this, since we   re onto some dirt  and dust; dad would get up and build a fire. Then he   d wake me up. Then  he   d take two buckets and walk down to the windmill and     And get water.  Bring back two buckets of water. I   d better be up and ready to go to the fire  (laughing) by the time he got back. He had steps that I could hear him walk  on, so boy, many times I   d get up out of bed and I was ready by the time that  he got in with those buckets of water. That was part of that.  Did he build his house with no north windows on purpose that way?  Yes, I don   t know.  The wind was prevailing from the southwest though.  But somehow, rather, we didn   t have the dirt. Now whether it was the way  that dad constructed those windows or not     It might have been the soil, too.  And the soil. We were out in the country, and it might have been better soil.  14  Pitzer  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Kite  Sanders  Mackey  Kite  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Pitzer  It wasn   t all plowed up. That was the trouble. Everybody was plowing up  everything they could get their hands on.  That was what caused trouble was getting the sod cut, you know, plowed up,  and then it blew. And see, it got dry, no rain.  Many a time we   d go out to milk the cows and Denton would hold one side of  dad   s hand and I   d hold the other one, and we   d walk     Together.  Together, so that we wouldn   t get lost. That was one thing that we did. Those  cows had to be milked and those calves had to be fed.  You had to give them water, too.  And we had to take them water. He had a well. I don   t know whether ours  was one of the first wells there or not, but we had a good well. There were  rocks there on the old Beaver River that he and neighbors built houses out of  the rocks that they   d carry up there. The well house, it was a well house there.  The well would run into one, and as well as I remember, it was a tank about  that deep. Down about this low it ran into another tank about like that. That  was where we put the cream for     Cooling.  From that it ran out into a tank, and that was the old horse tank.  Did you ever swim in it?  That was where I learned to swim, was in that old horse tank.  You sound like you know a little bit about that (laughter).  I don   t think she learned to swim in the horse tank (laughter).  No, I learned out here in the pool.  Were you swimming in horse tanks?  No, I didn   t learn to swim. I swam in a swimming pool.  Well you see, I lived in the country.  I lived in town.  I didn   t have those goodies in those days, they did.  I kind of got ahead of myself about going to the country. When we lived in  15  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  town here, we lived in a little three-room house, that   s when the red dirt storm  come up from the northwest.  Northwest?  Yeah, northwest.  The one in April come from south.  No. It come from the northwest.  Ours came from the north.  Northwest?  Yes, northwest, and it was the biggest. It was just a rolling like that. Boy, you  could see it rolling.  It was all colors.  Alfred and his hired man was out there at the railroad track, and that was just  about half a mile from town. They couldn   t even see to get on into town. I  was scared to death. That thing came up, and I thought the world was coming  to an end.  That was April    35? What colors did you see in it?  It came and dug the dirt up, and if your soil was red it would be red, if it was  black it   d be black. It was just different colors. We were down here at the  drug store on the corner where the little caboose is now, Buster and I and Bing  and Evelyn, his brother. Somebody come and said,    Look at this cloud,    so  we went out and looked at it. Buster said we   d better get home, and we lived  up there in Nacina Johnson   s house up there, across from Cordy   s up there.  They fixed it for us for a duplex, and that was our first real home. Bing and  Evelyn went in the back door and we went in the front door. Just as we got the  doors open that came down. It was just like a curtain dropped. It was black.  You couldn   t see across the room. You couldn   t see the light bulbs on. You  can   t believe that until you   re there. Isn   t that the truth?  That   s right. I really thought the world was coming to an end.  I didn   t think it was coming.  I watched that coming in and it was just boiling. You could see it way up.  There was nothing to break it. I live in the west part of town, see, northwest  part. That thing just kept rolling up and coming closer and closer and closer,  and I was there by myself.  Didn   t you see the different colors in it?  16  Pitzer  Lemons  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Kite  Mackey  Sanders  Kite  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Mackey  Sanders  I don   t know now (laughter) what I saw.  You were probably too scared.  I was so scared that I didn   t know what.  Well, our folks had gone to town to visit some neighbors that lived in town.  We kids all went to the movies because we could go to the movies and that  was rare that we got to go. Whenever we got through with the movies we   d  come out and there stood the folks. They had gotten down there to get us.  They didn   t want us getting out. Finally, dad decided we   d go home. Well,  we just inched with the vehicle. We all looked on the one side so that he  wouldn   t run into the ditch and all. But we made it home from that.  That was about five o   clock in the evening.  It was. It was time that we should have been home milking (laughter), but we  weren   t.  You mentioned that your dad would take you and hold you by the hand so you  wouldn   t get lost.  That   s right.  Uh-huh.  Did you ever get lost in a storm at all? Has anybody else ever had that  experience?  I didn   t.  To keep them from getting away from them they   d keep them with them. That  was what it was for.  I   m sure maybe too, that it was a father   s instinct. He had a hold to keep the  kids.  The wind might make them wander one direction or the other and kind of get  lost.  I worked with Buster, so I had the checks in my hand to take to the bank. It  was just next door. I went out the door and had the checks in my hand instead  of a bag. I don   t know why I didn   t put them in a bag, but anyway, I had them  in my hand  The door slammed in my face, and all of the checks went all over that  courthouse. Everybody in the garage went out, and we picked up checks. You  couldn   t see; you could hardly see. You could see the ground.  The ground.  17  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  We found every one of those 27 checks. I thought I was going to lose my job.  Homer liked to have had a stroke (laughter). You know Homer.  Yes.  He was afraid he   d lose a check.  You were talking about what we did for fun, and well, we had neighbors that  we visited. We usually had someone at our house on Sundays for dinner. If  not, we went to somebody   s house.  Yes.  Then we   d take, the Folkers, of course, were neighbors. They lived two and a  half miles from us, but we visited a lot. We   d go up here by the Kenton area.  We didn   t go to Kenton.  Oh, you didn   t go to Black Mesa?  No.  In the hills, that   s what we did.  Did you go to Watson Crossing?  I don   t know now what we went to.  Hallock Ranch.  It was more of a ranch.  Did you go to Hallock Ranch?  Oh yeah, Alfred played. We lived on a farm then, and he put a mattress in the  back of the pickup because he was playing the dance that night. That was on  Friday night, and he had to go to Vilas, that   s up north of Campo.  I used to go to Vilas (laughing).  So we cut across from out the Hallock   s Ranch     To Vilas.  To Campo.  Campo.  We got out north of Campo and he pulled out in a prairie there. We slept the  rest of the night on that old mattress. Then he got up the next morning and  18  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Kite  Pitzer  Sanders  went on up to Vilas and played the dance up there that night.  Those were the days. I wouldn   t want to do them over.  Oh, but didn   t we have fun.  We had fun. There wasn   t a time that we didn   t have fun.  Well if you were 19, 20, or 25 you   d probably be ready to go again (laughing),  now.  I wasn   t that old, but nevertheless, we had what we called play parties, and we  sang.  I couldn   t carry a tune. I didn   t have music in me.  It was kind of a square dance and all. I don   t know whether any of us could  really sing or not, but we did.  Oh yes, you were all musical.  I had them or if there was some place on that Saturday night somebody asked  them,    Will you come over to our house next week?     We didn   t have carpets on the floors then.  No, we played out in the yard.  Oh, those were play parties. That   s what they called them when I came out  here, was play parties. I   d never heard of them before.  I never did go to those very much.  I don   t like them.  Anyhow, I could always ask them to come out to our house if no one would  want to. Dad was always out around looking or mingling with the group. If he  found a couple sitting in a vehicle, he   d ask them to get out and go join and  have some fun.  Of course, that   s what they were trying to do at that time (laughter).  Courting, weren   t they?  Well, yeah. The second time he checked he   d tell them that they were not  going to park in his yard like that and they could just drive on down the road.  The parents realized that it was supervised, I guess, whenever it was at our  house. I had no idea how many times that we   d had them. At that time,  Wesley didn   t but once in a great great while, he might come, but his folks  came from Mississippi. His mother and all thought anything like that was a  19  Kite  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Kite  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Mackey  sin; you didn   t dance, you didn   t do this, and you didn   t do that.  We   ve heard a number of people talk about the play parties that they had.  And say, it was just kind of like a square dance.  Singing  The ladies to the  center and back to the far; the front to the middle, la la la.  The play parties wouldn   t play music, but the dances had music. You could  play party without the music, but some people couldn   t dance without the  music.  Yeah, that   s true.  Was a play party kind of like a dance without the band?  Well, you sang.  You sang instructions.  Singing  The ladies to the center and back to the far;  just kind of like that. I   ve lost all my words to all of the songs.  Oh I have, too.  That sounds like a square dance.  Well, it was.  Well, it is, but without the music.  You made your own music.  That   s a nit-picking thing: music and not music, dancing and not dancing.  I belonged to a quilting club. It was a lot of fun back in those days. They  were all pinochle players, and we   d have pinochle parties. Oh my, we   d have  pinochle parties.  How many people would get together in a quilting or pinochle party?  Well, there was about six or eight when it first started, the quilting. Later, as  time went on, there were more and more that played pinochle. Men really  liked to play pinochle.  The craze was Chinese Checkers. Did you ever play that?  Oh, yeah. I had a neighbor I played that with.  I remember reading about the Chinese Checker fad that came through.  Everybody was making their own boards and playing Chinese Checkers.  Yeah, Uncle Hill made the boards. We   d play everything. We   d play Bridge  20  Pitzer  Mackey  Sanders  Pitzer  Lemons  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  together and we   d play, not pinochle.  Pitch?  No, not so much Pitch, it was more Bridge and Chinese Checkers.  Did you all ever toss horseshoes?  Oh, yeah. I pitched horseshoes with a guy one time during Thanksgiving  dinner. He was going to play me to see who washed the dishes.  Who had to wash the dishes?  He did (laughter). He did. He liked to have died because he knew he would  beat me.  When the dust storm period began, do you remember any ways that that  affected or changed your lives at all? When it dried up and the dust started  rolling in and there wasn   t anymore rain, did your lives change a great deal?  I   m sure our spirits changed a whole lot when it started to rain and we could  raise something, a crop or garden.  We always had a garden. That was one thing that we always had. I learned to  can and do all of that. Of course, I was in 4-H and all that. Dad had made the  dugout, and he had put cement on it and all and the stairs. That   s where, if  he   d see a storm coming up like that, he   d make us all go to the cellar. We   d  all stay down there until it was down or over. The garden was pretty  important. I don   t know whether coming from Missouri was the thing or what,  but he planted a lot of mulberry trees, and we had mulberry jam.  Where were you from in Missouri?  Kansas City, that area.  We traded in Kansas City. We were 60 miles.  I   d have to go back and look at some of the records to know just where from  Kansas and Missouri they were.  They planted the trees so they   d have the birds. He came from where there  were a lot of trees and stuff. People always wanted to feed the birds.  Those big old mulberry trees they had down there, somehow rather, where the  moisture and all come off of where the horses and cattle all were enriched it.  They were huge. I   ve never seen any mulberry trees as big as those were. We  spent a lot of time climbing when whenever we   d have company kids, Denton  and I. We   d climb up in those trees. I don   t know how we ever kept from  falling out (laughter), but we never did.  21  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Kite  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Sanders  I don   t know how kids keep from being killed anyway. Jump in a pond where  you don   t know how deep it is, in the mud, and all that sort of thing. We  played golf, and the rattlesnakes, we killed rattlesnakes with a golf club. I   ve  done that. It   s scary.  Dad called the horse barn, where the horses were it had a roof that you climbed  up the stairs, and, I don   t know, there was an upstairs there that he kept.  Hayloft.  A hayloft. We   d get out that door and run down that and jump. My gosh, it  had to be ten feet or more we   d jump over. Oh, man.  Hay?  No, just on the horse yard.  Yard? I bet the reason that you didn   t have much dirt down there is because  your dad owned so much land that he didn   t keep it all plowed up way around  the house.  It might have been. We had that cream. He   d bring it in here and put it on the  train. It   d go to Elkhart and Garden City. I don   t know where all. I still have  several of those old cream cans.  They took eleven from us out at that old store.  They did?  Stole them.  So the dust storms and the drought doesn   t sound like it effected you too much.  You had your garden and you still kept your cows going. You weren   t forced  to sell off your cattle.  No, but I can remember the time the government, what were they doing, they  were killing the cattle and paying so much.  That   s what killed me. I never will get over that.  Dad never allowed that. He didn   t allow them on his land. They   d just better  never get on his land.  Did you know about that? They killed the cattle.  They   d pay you to kill your livestock.  And here people were starving to death. Whose idea was that?  I don   t know, but anyway, that was one thing that dad was so upset about. I  22  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Lemons  can still remember him being so upset about that because we had a neighbor  that sold. They didn   t sell all of their cattle, but they sold some of it.  I thought you had to.  No, you didn   t have to.  We didn   t have that problem because we were in a town, but I remember just  thinking of the kids going hungry and killing those cattle.  It was a voluntary program, I know that. Sometimes the neighbors would  force each other into it or out of it. If a group of neighbors wanted everybody  to do it they would try and coerce each other.  I don   t remember the details.  I think dad was Irish, and they weren   t going to (laughter).  Another one of the things that we haven   t mentioned that affected me terribly  were rabbit drives. Did you ever hear of a rabbit drive?  Oh, yes.  I   ve heard about them, but I haven   t heard of a firsthand experience.  They   d build a corner, and then everybody would get back here, women, men,  and children, and run these jack rabbits in this corner and then club them to  death. Of course, they were eating the grass.  And the garden.  They were, but what cruelty. It seems to me like they could do something else.  I herded lots of them, several of them up on the river.  You herded the rabbits down to the town?  Yeah. What you would do is you would take a section of land or mound of  land and they   d put up     Fencing.  Oh what do you call it? That stuff about that wide.  Barb wire.  No.  More like a chicken wire?  23  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Was it boards?  What kind of material was it, Faye?  It   d be high, and it had wire in it see. What do you call it? Panneling?  I know what you mean.  We call it now, snow fence.  That   s about what it is. They   d put posts down and put that up and then  everybody would get way back, maybe a mile.  Miles. And run them in that.  And drive them up there, and then they   d close, pull in that fence, see. I never  was at the killing. I just drove them in because I was mad at them, too.  We never did do that either. On Sunday afternoons, oftentimes, we   d go  hunting. That was where I learned to shoot. I was just as good a shot as my  brother was and some of the neighbors, Gordon and the Witten   s. The  Witten   s only lived a mile and a half off.  The first time I ever shot a rabbit (laughing) I went on a date and he said,     Let   s go rabbit hunting.    I said,    All right.    He said,    Will you shoot one?     I said,    Oh sure, I   ll shoot a rabbit.    I didn   t know anything about a gun or  anything. He said,    Helen, there   s one over there,    so I splat, and I shot the  darn thing. Then it just jumped like that and flapped over. I was just sick to  my stomach (laughter), but it was during the dust bowl days.  They did take some of them. People did, that had families. They took them  and dressed them.  Yes, but they were scared.  That was a little later on that they decided that they might have some kind of  disease, so they quit doing that. That did help people out at one time.  Oh yes.  One thing we learned from that was to get along. We did with what we had,  and we were happy with it. We didn   t know any different, I guess. I didn   t  think I was underprivileged or anything.  We had clothes, even though they were made out of feed sacks and flour sacks.  And of course, we were fortunate. We didn   t have any trouble with food.  Some people went hungry.  Well, we didn   t.  24  Mackey  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Kite  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Lemons  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  But now, we didn   t do that. Like you say, the quilting, I started when I was  about 15 making quilts. I made about 20 quilts all during that time, Aunt Ruby  and I. Mother wouldn   t make them; she made one in all that time. Now, I   m  just eating it up because I   m just loving those quilts.  Working for the railroad or the dray business, is that what you did while you  were in town?  That   s what Alfred helped his brother with. He had what they called it, dray.  They   d go to the depot and get stuff that   d come in on the train, see.  Donald Hill did that, too.  They did that until his brother left. They lost a boy in the dust bowl and they  had several children. Them and some of their neighbors both had an old truck.  They just loaded it up and went to Washington State and never did come back.  We didn   t lose very many people.  You want to take a quick break? We have to change tapes. Have we finished  up talking about how the dust period changed your lives? I was asking maybe  how the business or slow down of business during the depression and the dust  storms hurt the dray business or had affected your life a little bit.  Yes. Whenever his brother left here, that   s when he decided that he was going  to farm. His dad and him built several houses and had them rented. I tell you  what, the first crop we had he cut a little too early and it was green. He had to  pile it up in piles, oh not very high. We had to go out there that night, about  midnight or eleven o   clock at night, and turn that stuff over because it was  heating, getting hot. We   d have to turn it over. I thought, if this is going to be  the life of farming   Forget that (laughing).  Then one time, he was so busy, he had a guy coming to get some feed, it was  time to milk the cow, and it was just busy busy. I said,    You go on and I   ll  milk.    He said,    You don   t know how to milk, do you?    I said,    You just  think I don   t.    (Laughing) That   s the first time, but I didn   t ever have to milk  anymore. You know, only in a pinch. I could milk if I needed to, but I didn   t  want to let him know I could. He might think it   s a steady job.  He might want to take a vacation on you or something.  Yeah. There   s not much I haven   t done or tried to do.  Do you reckon that   s what   s wrong with my hands is all the milking that I   ve  done (laughing)?  Well, that   s the reason they   re so straight and pretty (laughter).  25  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  A lot of the times one of the interesting things we bump into a lot in talking  about is the vagrants or the traps or the hobos that would come into towns  during this period. Also, the experiences that townspeople or, sometimes  especially, in the rural areas they would hit pretty hard, had with these tramps  and hobos.  We never did turn down a single person.  Well, there weren   t very many out here because this was off the beaten path.  Well, the 64 Highway went through here, and it went by our place up there  where we live now.  We used to feed some.  One time I fed a guy where I live now, and I   ve lived there fifty-two years. I  fixed him some eggs and bacon right quick. And do you know that I handed it  to him, and before I could turn around, he had that eaten and was putting his     Hungry.  Yes. I couldn   t believe that he had it and put his stuff back on the porch. He  got out under a little shade tree and ate that. If I   d have had time and got to  talk to him, but I didn   t, I   d ask him if he needed some more.  No, but we didn   t have a lot of them. I guess where Wesley lived up there, he  said something about some highway or something or a road that they directed  by their place, and they had a lot of tramps or people coming in.  I bet they did.  We didn   t at home, but I do remember sometimes whenever they did show up  they were always fed.  I think everybody was generous with them.  They always thanked you.  They were. Dad had built a house. There was our house, and then right down  there was the dugout. Beyond that, we had one of the first washing machines  that was run by an engine.  Gasoline.  Gasoline engine. They had two tubs, and they were wooden.  And a thing in between them?  And you had to wind it in there. There was a bed down there. He had any  26  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  help that he had rented or somebody was helping him farm or anything, that  was where they slept. I have remembered a time or two maybe some would  come through, and dad would always take them down there and let them sleep  there. We were just up from what they call the Old Beaver River, whenever it  was running. After they built that dam up here, where was it they built up that  way, it very seldom has water in it now. It just looks old and dry. I can  remember storms coming and rains and all, and dad would drive us down there  where we could see the water coming down it and all. That was something, to  see that, because we didn   t get to often.  We had broomcorn hands, and most of them were always ready. They got  through in the evening, but they had to stay all night. Bed and Breakfast, and  oh they were going to give themselves haircuts and they were going to go out  in the tank and take baths. Alfred told them,    You get your stuff ready; I   m  fixing to go to town     laughing . I was sick and tired of them, you know after  you cook for them for several days, two or three weeks.  It gets old, I would guess.  Yeah, and I had some people that pulled broomcorn that just lived half a mile  from where they were pulling. She came over, her and her grandson, came  over five or six miles to where we were just to eat dinner that day. Alfred had  said there wouldn   t be anybody there for dinner that day. Two women drove  up, and I thought, my gosh. They said,    Is dinner ready?    I said,    Dinner   s  ready,    so I had to scurry up something for them to eat. That kind of irritates  you, too, I   ll tell you. I ought to have just sent them on, but I didn   t.  I didn   t know anybody had troubles like those.  Oh, yes.  In town, when people came by looking for food or things like that, would you  have them do some kind of work?  No, I just fed them. I didn   t have any work for them to do. I had a family, and  there wasn   t any grass. I just fed them.  Most of them were on their way out going some place else because this used to  be 64 Highway through here, see.  That room there, with the washer and the bed in it and all, and then the other  room was dad   s workshop. He was a good mechanic. Whatever needed to be  done he could fix it or he tried. In those days, of course, they didn   t have the  problems they have now with the equipment, but he did a lot of that. I know  that there were girls, as I got older, that wanted to come out to stay with me a  day or two because that way they could ride a horse. They could even go  swimming in the horse tank. Dad had also made a couple of kind of ponds  down to the south of there that he let the water run down in that in case he had  well trouble or anything. There   s many a time we   d get down in there and  play in the mud and take our shoes and socks off.  27  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Kite  Sanders  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Kite  Sanders  Before that there just wasn   t any water in that creek or river or whatever it  was, was there?  Yes, at Beaver River there was.  It had water in it?  Yes, but no longer since they built that dam back up there. Where abouts is  that? Colorado?  No, New Mexico.  New Mexico. Whenever we got a big rain or anything and that water came  pushing down there, dad would always take us down there to see it.  When I came out here I had curly hair, just as curly as it could be. You know,  those storms just took that curl right out of my hair. I guess I didn   t wear a cap  or I wore something on my head, scarf, too much or something. It   s a long  ways from being curly now.  It didn   t seem to bother my hair. My hair was curly. I never did have a  permanent.  It didn   t straighten your hair out?  Huh-uh.  What about your hairstyle?  It was straight.  I drove a tractor, see.  You probably had something on your head all the time. What kind of tractor  did you drive?  John Deere.  Was that the popular brand out here?  At the first of the sand dunes we had a Caterpillar. It could just crawl up over  those bumps. Later to grow crops he traded it in and got John Deere.  Did you use horses at a time and then switch to mechanical farming, or did  you always have a tractor out on your place?  They didn   t all the time because we had horses. Whenever he got the tractor, I  don   t know what Dad   s first tractor was. We had a tractor, I know. Whenever  Wesley was in service I came home one time. I always followed him around.  28  Kite  Mackey  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  If we knew that he was going to be in a certain place for a couple of weeks or  so, the folks or somebody would take me to Dalhart to catch the train, and then  I   d go over that way. Anyhow, we didn   t, but Wesley   s dad had a Caterpillar  tractor. I believe Dad   s first one was a Case tractor. But I tell you, that was  something paying for them.  You guys were on different ends. You worked in the bank, a banker, and you  probably dealt with the bank a lot, paying for your tractor and whatnot.  You went to the Keyes Bank though, didn   t you?  Dad, did he go to the Keyes Bank? I don   t know for sure.  Probably Texhoma.  I   m not sure whether he went to the Keyes Bank or what. We   re the same  distance from Keyes as we are from Boise City.  Did they have a bank over at Keyes at that time, in those early days?  They probably didn   t.  I don   t think they did. Most people down in your area banked down at  Texhoma.  Well, we went to Texhoma a lot, I can remember that. The folks and all went  to Texhoma. Of course, Dad getting that old Rio truck and get a lot of  groceries and stuff, he   d haul stuff back.  Yeah.  We didn   t have a care. We didn   t have a car for years and years and years.  I was going to ask you about working in the banking industry. Surely the  depression and the drought would have changed or affected the banking  industry a lot.  When we went to Keyes, it was over. We had gone up to Syracuse, Kansas to  go in with the international harvester implement. That was when the dust bowl  days were over, and they were beginning to get machinery. We just sold gobs  and gobs of machinery up there. Then Buster was going to have to go to the  army for his next draft, and so we left and went to Tulsa. He worked in  Douglas. Then we came back out here to Keyes and the bank. It didn   t seem  to me like anybody was too destitute or anything then. They were beginning  to kind of build up and have more crops.  We were paying for things, but we didn   t have any to spare.  Surplus.  29  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Kite  Mackey  What about friends or family that moved out? What about the Okies that  headed out west?  There weren   t as many here as there were a lot of other places, but we did  have.  We had quite a lot.  Did you lose some friends?  I didn   t have any.  A sister-in-law and a brother-in-law both. My sister-in-law, she and her  husband lost a nine year old girl here. She   s out in the cemetery.  Who was that?  Reena Hopkins and Al, that   s Alfred   s older sister.  No, I didn   t know him.  His oldest brother he had, they had six children when they left here.  I didn   t have anybody affected.  They   ve got five out here in the cemetery. They had twelve all together.  It was worse up in Campo, just the edge of Colorado, than it was here.  We were in the Garlington neighborhood, and there was the Garlington  Cemetery out there. There are a lot of people buried out there, and there still  are. That   s where Wesley and I have decided when we go that   s where we   re  going to be buried. My folks are buried there, and my grandparents. Wesley   s  great-grandpa is out there. He came out here to see them, and he passed away  whenever he came.  Yeah, that   d be the place.  Wesley still mows the cemetery usually because we have one of those riding  mowers. They say that our yard is half of the quarter anyhow, but it   s not  quite that much.  Probably ten acres.  Anyhow, we keep that mowed down.  Did any of the people you know that left, did they ever come back or did they  just stay where they ended up?  Some did.  30  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Pitzer  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Some came back, but I didn   t know them.  Some came back.  Do you know them?  I didn   t know anybody much that left.  I didn   t either really.  There were a lot of people that left.  I just stayed here (laughing), and stuck it out.  I know a lot of times the conditions that they found in California weren   t what  they thought, and they tried to make it back.  Well, this is home, too. We   re homier out here than most any place in the  world. Don   t you think we are?  It seems pretty homey to me.  We know everybody. My brother-in-law went up to the shipyards up at     Washington.  Yeah, up at Tacoma, that   s off of Seattle. He stayed; he liked it. All of their  family   s still up there. We used to, ten years straight, go up there and see  them. We   d take Alfred   s mother and go. Part of the time she stayed up there,  and one time we brought her back then.  Well, this is where I   m going to die (laughter). Buster and I are the only  family out here. If mother knew it she   d have a fit because everybody   s buried  back in Missouri. We have two lots which started back in the 1700   s, and  they   re all right there together: my mother and dad, my brother, grandmothers  and grandfathers. This was home, and we liked it and Buster liked it. He  came from Rockford and came down here and stayed, so we   re just going to be  here.  I think that   s up to everyone to make their decision. I think they ought to  make the decision before it happens to them so the family won   t have to deal  with that.  Well, we have our lots out there.  Helen, who   d Howard marry?  He   s in Missouri.  31  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Sanders  No, I meant who did he marry?  He married Dorothy Mirrors, A.B. Mirrors. Then they separated, and then he  married Joe Webb from     Iowa, I knew her.  They were in the army. She was in the army and he was too.  Is she still living?  Yes, we correspond.  Well, tell her I say hello. She used to be in one of the clubs I belonged to.  All right.  What I was thinking as we kind of wind down, maybe you could each talk  about your most vivid memory of the dirty thirties and the dust bowl. Maybe a  memory or recollection that sticks out in your head more than any other or  something that kind of sums the period up for you when you think back to that  time. Maybe it   s an incident like the checks blowing out or something that you  always think of.  This is just a personal thing, but we moved into this house, and my husband  was a fresh-air man. We had to have all the doors and all the windows open  all the time. So the dust bowl days came along, and it would blow and blow  and blow. I had hardwood floors and throw rugs. The wind would blow the  rugs up in little piles. I was just killed. I was just cleaning all the time. You   d  clean and then the dirt would start blowing in the afternoon, so I was just  cleaning all the time. One time I said,    Now Buster, if you leave another door  open you   re going to have to clean up. I   m not going to clean it up anymore.  You can close the doors and I   ll dig out what I can, but I   m not going to dig  out all this dirt that blows in here when these doors and windows are open.     He didn   t say anything and left the doors and windows open, so I went down  to mothers and went down there and stayed. I came home and got the meals,  and we just got along fine. But the dirt and the rugs were still turned around.  That was on Friday, and Saturday I went back down and stayed with mother  all day long. I left the rugs and the dirt and everything the way they were.  Sunday morning came along and I went to church. When I came back that  house looked like a diamond (laughing). He had cleaned it all up, and it was  all closed up. He never left the doors and windows open again, but I   d have  left that room that way until he did it (laughter). We didn   t quarrel about it, I  just did it that way. There wasn   t anymore dirt unnecessary like it was.  That   s funny.  We did what we had to do.  A memory of the dust bowl, it   s just the fact. It   s part of what we   ve lived  32  Mackey  Sanders  Kite  Lemons  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  through. We made it, and we   re continuing to make. I   ve worn overalls  because I rode horseback a lot, I herded cattle, and of course, I milked. You  know what that would be like straddling around with a bucket in between your  legs. Anyhow, that   s just part of the life. Maybe that   s why I   m here today.  Wesley was in the same community more or less, but, here   s this here, after we  got married and the Union Chapel Church disbanded, he wanted to go to  Keyes. I said,    Oh no, let   s go to Boise City because that   s where my folks  went and all.    He says,    No, as long as our kids are at school in Keyes, we are  not going to divide their loyalty.    It was 16 years after Cecilia had graduated  from high school at Keyes that we transferred our membership up here to  Boise City.  I remember when you came   It   s just been a part of life, and fortunately, we   re still together. In May we   ll  be married 59 years.  59 years.  Wow.  You were married on my birthday, May, 30th.  Yes.  And so was Lavina.  Lavina. But I tell you, and his aunt just liked to had a ring-tailed hissy fit  because we were married on the 13th, that   s Memorial Day. Aunt Sally, she  just couldn   t hardly stand that.  What was so bad about that?  It was Memorial Day. I don   t know what was her hang up because she was an  old maid that had lived with Wesley   s folks.  We don   t know when Memorial Day is anymore because it   s on a different  day. I don   t know what day my birthday is because it   s always on a different  day anymore (laughing).  It   s always on the 30 of May.  Yeah (laughter).  I   ve still got that up there. There   s a lot of things I don   t have up there.  And you know, here   s something else that come to my mind. They had  quilting clubs and they   d come to our house. We kids would get down, climb  those mulberry trees, and we   d run down and get over in those ponds and we   d  play with mud and all. I can   t remember one mama ever getting up and  33  Mackey  Sanders  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  coming and seeing what we kids were doing.  I know it. We just took care of ourselves.  We did, and we had a lot of fun.  What about you and your most vivid recollections or remembrances?  Oh, I don   t know. Talking about her dirt and her husband.  I shouldn   t have told that (laughing).  Alfred and I always worked as a team. If I worked in the field with him, he  helped me at the house. He always got up and made the coffee first. That   s  always been the same. I   d work out in the field right with him. I   ve got out  there and got a knife and picked up corn. Mary Parton and I were wanting to  do something and I got Mary to help me and we went out and picked up a load  of corn in the back of the pickup.  We took in a girl when she was 13, and she lived with us. Her mother had  brought her down here from Denver for her uncle to take care of, and his wife  didn   t want her. That   s Dorris. She needed some things to start to school  with, so we took that corn over to Clayton and sold it. We went and bought  her a pasteboard clothes closet. We got here some slippers and underwear and  stuff to go to school because she didn   t have any clothes. She drove down the  road with us one day and she looked at me and she looked at Alfred and she  said,    Do you care if I call you mom and pops?    Alfred said,    No, whatever  you want to call us, that   s what you call us.    To this day, she   s called us. She  said,    Well, all the kids are going over to this western dance tonight in  Clayton, and I   d like to go while we   re here at Clayton.    Alfred said,    All  right, we   ve still got some money,    so we went to the old western dance and  took her. She had a good time, and she came home with us. When her  husband went to service she came home and stayed.  She married young didn   t she?  Yes, she did. When she came in and told me that she had a ring. One night, it  was about ten o   clock, she said she had a ring and wanted to show it to us. I  told her,    Well, what   d Charles do? Get that out of a rock up at Kenton  somewhere?    I kind of kidded her, you know. I thought she was too young to  get married, but she had had a lot of responsibility. She had a brother and her  mother worked all the time, and she   d have to get up and get him ready to go  to school.  Well, they   re still together, aren   t they?  They   re still together. She was 16 and he was 20. They   re still together and  have two girls. She   s always taught them to call me Grandma, even the boys.  Their husbands all call me Grandma Faye.  34  Lemons  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Sanders  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  That   s a great story.  Yeah, that is a great story.  They   re still together, and Alfred and I were married. It   ll soon be eight years  he passed away.  Has it been that long?  Yeah. 61 years, so we whipped it out pretty good. Oh, and I must tell you,  this little girl was so proud of her little red sandals, they were nice dress  sandals for kids, and she wanted to go show her aunt. She went over there and  her aunt said,    Why   d she get you them kind of shoe? Why didn   t she get you  some shoes you could go to school in?    She told her that she   d got her some  pretty underwear and all. When she came back and got in the car she felt bad.  I said,    What did she think I was going to do? Dress you in long handle  underwear and high-top shoes?    She was in the pep club. Who was Elmer  Turner   s wife? Christine. She made her a pep club skirt, and different ones. I  had a sister-in-law send me some material for different ones to make her  clothes. She hasn   t forgot it. She   s still pretty special.  Wow, that   s a neat story. Is there anything else you can think of looking  through your questions?  I was just thinking about our groceries, the price of groceries during the dust  bowl days. I can   t say it; I   ve never been able to say it. Bread was worth a  nickel, six for a quarter. Now, it   s  2 a loaf, somewhere around there, a dollar.  We got on.  We used to stir up biscuits in nothing flat.  I made our bread all our life. We ground our own wheat and ground milo, and  I   ve made muffins out of them.  Yeah, you did.  Anymore, I   ve got so much that I quit. I think I paid a  1.79 for a loaf of  whole wheat bread the other day.  Yeah, you sure did.  I get my whole wheat at Moore   s, and it   s a dollar nine. It   s really good. It   s  whole wheat.  It   s down on the north end.  How long does it take to get to Keyes?  Oh, probably 20 minutes.  35  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Pitzer  Mackey  Kite  Mackey  Kite  Sanders  Kite  Sanders  Kite  Mackey  Kite  Lemons  Mackey  Kite  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  I bet you could get a lot of information over there.  By the time you get out of here, it   ll be time.  By the time I eat another doughnut (laughing).  It   s about 15 miles over there.  I hope we haven   t bored you.  No, no, not at all. Well, you   ve got these questions, and anything else that you  can think of sparks a memory or a story, something we didn   t cover you can  call Mrs. Randolph here or call us at the university. She has the numbers.  Are you the one that called me on the telephone?  Yeah.  You were the one that called.  We called and bothered you.  Well, good.  Feel free to call or tell her and we can call you on our nickel (laughing). It   s  free for us because we don   t pay for it.  All right, we   ll let you do the calling (laughing).  Just let her know if you want to talk some more that   d be great.  Or if you talk to someone else and they say that they would like to talk to us  that   d be fine, too.  There   ll be a dozen things that we   ll want to tell you after we get away from  here.  Usually people do. They get home and they go,    Oh we could have talked  about that.     I want to tell you about this. None of the other girls learned how to play that  piano, and when I came along I was going to have to learn that or else. They   d  make me go back into that north room there where we had the piano and all.  I   d practice for a while, and then there was a door that I   d escape out of it. I  have gotten more whoppers doing that (laughter).  I have no talent for that.  I don   t have exactly talent either.  36  Mackey  Kite  Sanders  Pitzer  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Pitzer  Kite  Mackey  Pitzer  Mackey  Sanders  You do have.  You learned to play.  Some, but I haven   t been to our piano for   it   s in our living room, and I never  play it.  You ought to just get in there and just play it.  I sold mine during the dust storm because the dust was ruining it. My  grandmother left me hers. Like you said, it   s a big old heavy one.  Oh, it is heavy.  I sold it. I could just kill myself now. I   d like to have it now, but what would  I do with it in that little apartment?  I never did have a piano. I took piano lessons when I was a kid, but I didn   t  learn it.  A, B, C.  Alfred could.  And I can   t sing a note.  They   ve got the horn over here in the museum in this music thing, his horn.  He gave his banjo, gave his guitar.  I have two violins, but what   d I do with those? We never had a guitar.  We gave the banjo, or I did, to his nephew. I   ve still got a guitar.  You   ve got two violins?  I   ve got a junior one, for a child, and then I have a big one. I had dad   s, and  then they gave Larry one when he was little. Mrs., what was her name that  played the violin up here? He was an oil man.  Oh, Evelyn Price.  Uh-huh, she was going to give him lessons. He got a carving set for  Christmas, and he was carving wood and cut his hand. He never could learn.  Well, it hasn   t been an easy life, living out on the farm and all. Wesley was  harvesting corn and he had gotten some over. He got out and he was doing  this way. He reached too far and it grabbed him. They said if he hadn   t been  as big as he was, it would have pulled him on through. On his right hand, all  he has left is this and this.  37  Mackey  Sanders  Kite  Sanders  Mackey  Sanders  Mackey  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Sanders  Kite  Mackey  Sanders  Lemons  He does pretty well with it.  He does, he does.  I always heard you   re not a real farmer unless you   ve got something missing.  It   s his hand. He was a right-handed person. He had to learn how to do  everything with his left hand. At least, he   s not feeling sorry for himself.  I think that   s how we got by. We just went right on, and was happy with  everything. We did the best we could with what we had.  We   re still doing it.  I   m going to go on enjoying it as long as I can.  Make sure you do tell Mrs. Randolph if you have more you want to talk about,  and we can give you a holler.  We do appreciate you coming up and talking with us today.  Yeah, thank you so much.  Knowing the three of us we could probably chat from now until dark.  We don   t have enough tape for that.  I still mow my own grass. I   ve got five lots. At the rent houses, I   d rather do  the grass myself than hire somebody to do it.  Well, we appreciate you all.  Well, we   re trying to get this done before there   s nobody left to talk to us.  -------  -------
