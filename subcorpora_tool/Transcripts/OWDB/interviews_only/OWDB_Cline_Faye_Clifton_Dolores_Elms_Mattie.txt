 Kite  Elms  It   s January 10, 2001. We are at the Cimarron Heritage Center in Boise City,  Oklahoma. At noon today, we   ll be talking with Mary Ione Cutter, Dolores  Clifton, Mattie Letha Elms, and Louise Fairchild about their experiences in  the Boise City/Cimarron County area in the dust bowl.  Faye Cline is also here. We   ve got one more coming, is that right? Well, you  all have had a chance to look at these questions? We   re just going to talk  about some general topics. There   s nothing particular that we have to talk  about, and it   s not a formal interview. We   re just talking to hear you talking  and gather some stories and memories. That   s all we   re doing.  I am going to be keeping track of who   s saying what, so that when we go back  to type it I can get them in the right order. If you don   t mind, before we get  started, could you please state your name, when you were born, and where, I  can keep track of you from there.  I   m Faye Cline. I was born February 7, 1914.  In Cimarron County?  No, in Texas County. Rice was my post office at that time.  Dolores Clifton. I was born in Cimarron County, south of Boise City four  miles, May 6, 1915.  Mattie Letha Sanders Elms, born August 2, 1920 nine miles east of Boise City.  I   m guessing just from where you were born that you all grew up in rural  areas or in a farming community. Is that right?  That   s right.  Your fathers and mothers were doing the farm work or were farmers as well.  Is that a fair assumption?  That   s right.  5  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Elms  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Kite  Elms  Let   s talk about what a typical day might have been like for each of you in the  late twenties or the early thirties. On a standard day, when you got up, what  would you do? What did you have to do, chores, or activities?  We had chores to do  laughing .  Anything in particular you remember about those?  We had cows to milk and chickens to feed and hogs.  Yeah, slop the hogs.  Yeah.  Does that ring any bells with you all? What do you remember as being  standard?  It rings lots of bells for me. I started milking cows when I was five years old.  I milked them twice a day. There were seven of us kids in the family, and as  quick as we got five we went to the barn. That was our livelihood. We sold  cream and eggs for our money. We shipped the cream from the station up  here. That was a typical day for me. I didn   t leave the cow lot until I went off  to college. I milked it everyday. That was our job. My dad was a farmer, and  he had to go to the field, my mother did the cooking, and we did the chores.  On Saturday, the household chores were divided up among the kids. My two  brothers were born during the dust bowl, and had dust pneumonia, so they  didn   t work while I was there. I went off to school before they got old enough  to do the work. Then they had it to do.  Does that sound familiar to you?  We had the usual farm chores, chickens, hogs, and cattle. I remember going  with my dad, during the dust bowl days when they didn   t have feed, going  with him in a wagon down in the ranch pasture to chop soap leaves, yucca, to  feed to the cattle. And thistles, great piles. That was about all the weeds there  was. The cattle ate those.  I remember my dad, everything about money was kind of hushed in the family,  but I remember my mother and dad talking about borrowing  100 to feed the  cattle. I thought we were just terrible having to borrow that much money,   100. We milked up in the 20 to 25 cows twice a day. One morning we went  out, and 14 of the best milk cows lay dead. They   d gotten into some cane and  ate it, and all 14 of them were dead. You needn   t to think that wasn   t a  drawback to money.  25 seems like an awful lot of cows to have.  It was, but that was how many we milked.  6  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  How long would it take you to get through that milking everyday?  It depends on how many were milking. I usually milked four or five cows  myself. We got up at five o   clock and got breakfast ate so we could go to  school. During the dust bowl, we drove up here to Boise, the nine miles to  school.  Where all did you attend school?  I went to North Fork country school.  How far away from your house was it?  We had about four miles to go to. We had a light wagon. That   s the way we  went to school. We had to wrap up in quilts and everything.  How were your school days? How far did you have to go?  To Boise City. I never went to a country school. I guess at one time, there  was one about two miles. I never went. I rode a school bus. I got on early in  the morning and off late at night because it was a long route.  Do a little sleeping on the bus.  Laughing .  I attended grade school when I was   grade school was a country school about  three and three fourths miles. I rode a horse, three of us on a horse, for five  years. Then we rode in a buggy, and then we got a car. I was seven years old  before we got a vehicle.  Three of you on one horse?  Yes   And hang on tight.  Yep, we sure did.  Did all the schools have stables or places to put your horse? Would you tie it  to a tree?  No, we had a barn where we put our horse.  Somebody earlier was talking about having to bring lunch for themselves and  then something for the horse to eat too, lunch for the horse.  Yeah, we had to feed the horse.  That was a thought that I had never even thought of.  7  Cline  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Lemons  Cline  Elms  Cline  Clifton  Carry your dinner in a bucket and give her a bucket.  What was the typical lunch that you remember bringing to school?  My mother made homemade bread, so we had homemade bread and ham.  Usually we had something sweet or an apple if we had it. I used to think these  people that had bought bread was just the most wonderful people, because I  just couldn   t picture it. We never did have bought bread. She made bread  every other day, eight loaves.  Eight? That   s a lot of baking.  The time we rode the horse we were three south. We came back north, and  then we had to turn west to get to our home. We took the blanket off the horse  and tied it to the north side of us so we wouldn   t freeze to death. We wore lots  of clothes. We were always late to school. We were three and three quarter  miles from school and milking cows and feeding the horse, you just didn   t get  there on time. I guess they didn   t count us tardy.  Do you have any adventures riding your horse to school?  Well yes, we had a runaway a time or two  laughing . There were nine in my  family, so there were some older ones. There were a lot of things that I didn   t  have to do.  Laughter   Until they moved on, and then it went on to you.  Yes, but by then people had cars.  I   m just going to move on to the actual beginning of the dust bowl and when  times began to change a little bit. How did your life change a little bit? How  did a typical day change for you? Were there differences that you noticed in  that period?  I got married in    32, so life did change.  A lot, I   m sure.  Of course, we still lived in the country. We lived with his folks for a year, a  little over a year. We had dirt storms then. I lived in a part dugout. It was bad  sometimes. During that time was when the Black Sunday hit on the 14th of  April.  1935.  Was that when it was? It was April 14, I think.  I remember helping my father farm. That was after we got a tractor. My  8  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Kite  Cline  Elms  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Cline  Elms  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Clifton  brother was six years younger, so I helped my father farm. I drove a tractor  and helped him for a number of years. Tractors were quite different then.  There were no tires.  I didn   t help farm at home, but I did after I got married  laughter .  Did you use horses or a tractor?  A tractor, they all had tractors then.  I started high school up here when the dirt storms were the worst. You   d leave  home of a morning with a clean dress and face washed, and then dirt would get  up during the day. When we   d go home you couldn   t even tell the color of  clothes. You were just dirty, as if you   d never had a bath. Everyday, everyday  the dirt would come, all during my high school.  I would guess it would make laundry a difficult thing.  It was, because most of us had to carry water  laughing .  Lots of times you shook out some of your clothes and wore them again.  That   s right. My dad ran a thrashing machine, and he also drilled wells out in  there. I didn   t have him to write down where all he drilled the wells. I don   t  know.  You mentioned you found out your parents had to borrow  100. Does anybody  else have any remembrances of parents going through a hard time?  We never did have any money really, but it seems like we always had  something to eat.  You raised it.  Yes, we raised a big portion of it.  It was chickens and eggs. We came to Boise City once a week on Saturday in  a wagon. Us kids took turns coming. We didn   t get to come every time. We  usually got treated with an ice cream cone.  Do you remember any special treats you had as a child?  Not really, I know times were hard, but I can   t remember our parents talking  about it.  They just didn   t.  We were young and didn   t worry about it. I can remember my cousin talking,  and thinking how hard it must have been for them. We didn   t know it.  9  Cline  Elms  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Cline  It   s just been hard.  Well, we were used to it. We never had anything, so we didn   t worry.  We were used to it.  My dad came from Mississippi, and my mother did too. They came to  Arkansas. That   s where they had Malaria. We had an aunt that lived with us.  He moved to Altus. He got down there and heard that there were tracts of land  that could be bought up here. In 1906 he came up here and bought the original  farm home. He ended up buying nine quarters by the dust bowl time. My  brother was telling me that they didn   t charge him interest, but he could pay it  whenever he got the money for two quarters. He paid it off in    29, I remember  that.  Wow, that   s pretty rare, no interest.  That was just that one time on some land he bought.  Do you remember any changes in the food that you had? Like if you didn   t  have as much meat because of the weather, or more beans?  Well, we didn   t have as much meat, no. That is when I was at home. After I  married we always had meat, because they raised hogs and butchered calves  and chickens. At home chicken was our main meat supply.  That   d be a typical dinner, would be some fried chicken?  Yes, or baked chicken or boiled chicken  laughter .  Chicken salad, chicken soup  laughing .  My mother always quilted, so I remember quilting before I was six years old.  Six to eight years old I was quilting. I still do.  You should be pretty good at it by now.  Well I don   t know how good.  That was a typical occupation back in those days, quilting. In fact, we wet  quilts and sheets, and hung them in the windows when the dirt blew.  To prepare for the dirt.  Yeah, that   s how we prepared for it. I think you asked how you prepared for a  dust storm. You really didn   t have much time, but we knew to shut the  windows and the doors.  That   s the main thing, to get the doors and windows to shut.  10  Elms  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Lemons  Kite  Clifton  Sometimes you could see, especially when they boiled up in the north, see  them coming. Maybe you could prepare in that you saw everything was shut  up.  I remember one time, Carl was working in the field and I was working in the  house, and he saw a storm coming up. He was close to the pasture, so he  decided to go over and bring the cows in. The dirt storm hit, and he got lost  until he found a fence. When he found the fence he just followed it around  until he got to the house.  I think getting lost sounds like a terrifying aspect.  Well, you just don   t realize which way you   re going or anything.  Did you ever get lost in a storm?  No.  You never got caught outside or anything?  Well yes, I   ve been caught outside.  We were caught in that    35 storm. We   d come to a funeral here at Boise. We  went out to 64 and got on the curve out there and you couldn   t see nothing.  Like that, you couldn   t even see. We had to stop; there were six of us in the  car. When it got a little lighter in the night, we saw a light in a house. We  drove to that house and got out. The lady had just taken fresh bread out of the  oven  laughter . I never will forget that. We put butter on it, and it sure was  good. We didn   t get home until the wee hours of the morning. That   s when  my brothers had dust pneumonia, they were at home. Mother had quilts in the  window and them in a room to themselves, so the dust wouldn   t settle in on  them. That   s something I   ll always remember, that dust storm. My husband  was going the other way. We weren   t married of course. His sister looked out  the window to watch the weeds along the side of the road, and he kept driving.  When they got to a place, they decided they were out in a field. They hit these  lister furrows. He thought he   d better stop because he was lost. Come to find  out, he was still on the road, and that was mounds of dirt across the road. He  couldn   t even see them, you know.  It was so rough, he thought he was in a field.  In the field where it had been listed.  That would be pretty scary I would think.  What about you Mrs. Clifton? Have you ever been caught out in a dust storm?  No, not that I remember of. We knew enough to stay in if we saw one coming.  11  Kite  Cline  Elms  Clifton  Elms  Cline  Clifton  Cline  Kite  Elms  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Kite  We heard a lot of stories of chickens blowing away. They got left out, and  away they   d go.  Laughing   They did. The chickens. I noticed something, maybe it was in here, about  animals. They sense when a storm is coming, cattle.  Our horses ran.  Birds do. You can tell by their actions.  They   d run in circles.  Cows nearly always came to the corral, like when Carl got lost. The cows, if  he just stayed with them he could get back.  Laughter   Of course then, the wind blew day and night.  That   s right, it did a lot of times.  And the horses would, you were saying, run in circles?  Or around the lot and cut up, like just biting each other. It was just like a  bunch of kids having fun. That   s the way they   d do, and sure enough, we   d  have a storm.  What about the birds you were mentioning?  Well they would just fly all over, it seems to me, kind of in bunches.  Well they   d fly ahead of the storm.  They could sense that there was a change in the weather.  This was before you could even see anything was coming on? That would help  you to know that something was happening.  Prepare.  The dogs wanted in the house.  I think everything wanted in the house.  Laughing  Well what about after one  came through?  You had to clean up.  Laughter   Well, you couldn   t set the table. If you did, you turned your plates upside  down until you got ready to eat, because the dust would settle on the plates.  We had a story about a guy who worked in a grocery store who said that the  12  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Elms  Clifton  Elms  peanut butter was the hardest thing to keep clean. The sand would get in that  peanut butter.  Laughter  How would you clean up your houses afterwards?  Was that an ongoing struggle?  Yeah, we didn   t have any kind of electrical equipment, so we had to sweep it  with a broom and mop with water. We had an eight-room house and  basement, so we had lots of rooms to clean.  Laughing   Lots of extra rooms to clean.  Upstairs and downstairs.  What about you guys? Do you have the same memories of cleaning up the  messes?  A lot of them.  Laughing  Especially after I was married. Before, I don   t  remember doing a lot.  A lot of things changed for you when you got married.  Yes.  When you did the washing, you had to try to find a pretty day, what you  thought would be a pretty day. Probably before you got it out the dirt was  blowing.  Well other than a lot of shoveling going on     You shoveled  emphasized .  I heard people say that they got the grain shovels out and cleaned up their  houses. I can   t imagine that.  You didn   t prepare like they say, but at night you sure would sweep it up and  take the shovel and shovel it out. We had windows on the north, kind of a  built in porch. Back then, we didn   t have storm windows, so it really came in.  Well, other than the way things changed for you in the thirties, what kind of  thing did you do for entertainment during that period of your life?  Well, my husband was quite a musician. He played any kind of string  instrument, so we always had a lot of music.  Laughing   We had play parties in our country. We always had a play party going. We  sang our songs; we didn   t have musical instruments. We all sang.  And church.  Yeah, we always had church.  13  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Lemons  Clifton  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Did you have play parties as well?  Play parties, they were not so much where I lived. They did a little farther  from town.  Yeah, you were a little closer. So music, do you guys remember bands or  dances or Mr. Cline playing away at something?  Laughter   We went to a lot of dances, because he loves to play.  What did he play?  He played the fiddle and the banjo and the mandolin and the piano.  Okay, what didn   t he play?  Laughter   That   s right. Anything with strings on it, he played.  Do you remember some favorite songs of his that you remember he liked to  play, or that you liked to hear?  Well, there were a lot of them, but I couldn   t think of a name.  It seems like there was always a dance or something going on somewhere.  What activities would go on in the church, or was going to church your  entertainment?  I can remember when they had the Christmas program. It seems like people  would bring in presents for all of the families, as I remember it.  That   s right.  What kinds of things?  Today, it seems so out of place, but that   s the way I remember it. We had  programs with children leading everything. You   d go in the snow, maybe. It  was cold to get out, but we did to go to the Christmas program.  Our school, a country school, didn   t have lights in it of any kind, so when we  had a program, we went to the church. The church had lights, so our  Christmas program of the school   s was preformed at church. I can remember  going in the wagon and the buggy from our house to church on snowdrifts and  never seeing the ground. It was constant snowdrifts, solid. It was frozen, you  know, and we just drove on top of it.  We wouldn   t think of getting out like that now without a heated car  laughter   or on a sled.  So everyone would bring presents to the church, is that what you   re saying?  14  Elms  Cline  Elms  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Yeah.  They would bring for their family, so everybody would get a gift.  So everybody would get a gift.  What were some of the typical gifts that were brought to the church or given at  that time?  I can remember speaking about some fellow bringing a saddle as a gift for  someone in his family. That doesn   t seem like what they would do, but that   s  the way I remember it.  It seems like everybody else is remembering the same thing.  There were always dolls.  Some of them were homemade.  As time went by and people made more money, they had a little problem of  those that did buying a little bit better gifts. Some of the families couldn   t, and  it created a problem. That kind of quit. We quit doing that because of that. I  can remember that.  Was that something that took place during the depression and when things  started to pick up that practice stopped?  Stopped.  That   s interesting. So we had dolls, saddles  laughing  being brought to the  church. Anything else you can remember getting?  There were a lot of little metal cars and tractors.  What was the favorite thing that you received?  A doll, of course  I   ve still got a little old trunk that they gave me to put my  doll clothes in.  Wow, you kept them all that time?  Yes.  Do you have a favorite doll?  No, mine was usually homemade.  I remember we got a scooter. They make a big to do about the scooters now  that they have on the market, but we got us a scooter. We always had a little  15  Cline  Elms  Cline  Elms  Cline  Kite  Elms  Cline  Clifton  Elms  Kite  Cline  Clifton  Cline  Clifton  Elms  red wagon, and we always had access to a shovel. More times than one, we  dug holes in the ground and called it going to China  laughter .  They used to make a deal with a broom handle and a wheel that would turn,  and you would just turn that around. You wouldn   t walk; you were running.  Yeah, and there   s nothing like a rubber tire to roll around in.  Yeah, we always had a lot of fun rolling in rubber tires.  One time we were digging to China. My brothers were digging with a  grubbing hoe, and they cut my foot, cut a big gash in my foot. One of my  brothers said that they had always heard that fresh dirt was good for cuts, so  they seated me beside the hole and piled my foot with dirt. I guess it was all  right, because I never remember that getting infected  laughter .  Anyway, we made our own fun. It wasn   t bought. We just had to make our  own fun.  It sounds like if something rolled around that it was of particular interest to  you guys.  Yeah, a tumbleweed did.  We used to tie ropes on tumbleweeds and try to follow them.  Laughter   There wasn   t anyone that had any better toys than we did. We didn   t know  about it. We didn   t know how poor we were.  Yeah at that time, early time.  What about your favorite clothes that you remember having, like a dress or  something that you thought was prettier than others?  We didn   t have very many. When we came home from school, we had to  change into our work clothes, and wear that same dress back to school.  My mother made all our clothes. She made them over many times. She was  happy to get anything that was given to her.  Whatever was passed down.  Laughing   Mama would even rip our coats apart and turn them wrong side out. The  wrong side was pretty. They   d go over that coat.  I had a cousin that lived Oregon. My dad   s brother lived up there and only had  one child. It was a girl a little older than me, and she mailed me a box of  clothes every year. Her clothes were nice. They really didn   t fit me, but it just  took a safety pin to lap the skirt over and pin it. I   d wear it to school.  16  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  You made it fit.  I made my first dress when I was in sixth grade. I made two dresses, and I  wore them to school all year. I   d wear one everyday and, like you say, wear it  all week. Then I   d wash it and wear the other one. I made them myself.  We don   t ever think about wearing the same clothes all week long now.  No you wouldn   t. In fact, some of these kids have to change twice a day   Did you have relatives or friends that moved out of the area when it started to  get bad? Did you know people that left?  People, but not many of my relatives left. We just stayed.  My relatives didn   t move. We didn   t have any relatives move, but we had a  neighbor that went to California, and two or three other families that went as a  result of the dirt.  We had relatives living close, uncles, aunts, and cousins. I can remember  herding cattle with my cousin. That was fun I guess. We didn   t know we  were working.  You were probably rolling something around while you were doing it.  My dad having come from Mississippi, I had no relatives any closer than  Oklahoma City. Whenever they came to see us, we rolled out the red carpet.  When I married my husband, he was raised by cousins by the dozens, and he  couldn   t understand why we put on such a big show when our relatives came.  We thought a lot of them because we never did see them.  What would you do that was extra special for them?  We cleaned house and waxed the floors and baked extra bread and made sure  we had clean sheets on the bed.  Did they come out during the dust storm period?  Yeah, some of them came.  It wasn   t so bad in Oklahoma City. Were they shocked when they would see  what you were living through?  Yeah I guess, in a way. They drove a Model-T out here. We   ve got pictures  of them. They came clear from Oklahoma City.  Why do you think you stayed and other people left? A lot of people left, but  what was it that made you and your families stay?  17  Cline  Clifton  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  We didn   t have enough money to leave on.  Laughter  And this was home, so  we just stayed.  Maybe they didn   t know where they would go to better themselves. They  probably thought about that. My dad came from Missouri. I   m sure they  wouldn   t have gone back there, so there was nothing to do but stay here and  try to make it.  My dad bought land. He owned his land. Some of these people that went to  California didn   t own their place, and that made a difference. They could  leave. Through the dust bowl, we owned nine quarters.  Did he acquire land through that period of people leaving, so he was able to  get it cheaper?  Well yes.  We   ve heard one story of a gasoline station owner whose customers couldn   t  pay their bill, and they would just give him the deed to their land and take off.  That   s right.  We just lived in a two-room shack, Carl and I did. We were almost covered up  with dirt, so we wanted to get a house out there. They were selling the houses  in the town and moving them out. We tried to mortgage 240 acres for  900 to  buy a house. The guy came out from Oklahoma City, and of course the dirt  was blowing. He came to the door to tell me that they had refused the loan.  Then I had to give him  15 for coming out there to tell me that  laughter . He  wouldn   t even take that land for collateral for the  900.  Did you have to stay in your small house?  We did for another year or two.  Minus  15.  Yes.  Laughing   My dad was a carpenter. He started out in a dugout. He dug a basement and  built three rooms on top of that. Then he added on to this side and this side.  Then they had an upstairs, so we ended up with a pretty good-sized house. He  built it all himself.  He started out on the dugout?  Yeah.  So he built from the ground up.  18  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Elms  Kite  Lemons  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  That   s right.  Have you seen this dugout out here?  I haven   t been in it.  It   s small; it   s tiny. I couldn   t believe how small it was. Was it your house  that was partial dugout?  When I was at home, it was a two-room dugout. There were seven kids that  lived in there.  He added rooms by curtains.  One room and a lot of curtains.  Laughter   What about you Mrs. Clifton, what was your house like?  My dad built an adobe house. It was a two-room house. He made the adobe  out of sod and formed them into twelve-foot blocks. That was a two-room  house. The adobe house was warm in the winter and cool in the summer.  And that was the house that you grew up in.  Yes. I still live in it, part of it.  You still live in it right now?  Yes. He built onto the house.  Wow. So you live, right now, in the house that you grew up in.  On the place where I was born. Five generations of our family has lived on that  quarter. They don   t now, but they have at one time on down.  How   s that house standing up? How   s that mud brick structure? Is it still in  good shape?  Pretty good, pretty good.  And then plaster over that would keep the rain out or whatever.  Stucco.  Right. You never thought about moving to a different place?  I thought about it, but I   m not moving to town as long as I can stay there.  19  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Cline  Elms  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Cline  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  So sometimes just the thought of it being your home kept you here?  You can   t leave it.  You didn   t have enough money to leave, or you didn   t know where you were  going.  I don   t know that I ever even thought about leaving. My family never made a  comment about it. I think it   s because we owned the land.  We thought about leaving. Even Carl   s dad and his brother went down east  and looked at land, but they didn   t find anything that looked like home.  Any better   So they came back. I lived in the same house for 58 years, and then I moved  to Boise City.  One thing I didn   t mention a while ago is that we herded cattle. We had open  range, and we   d ride a horse, some of the different kids would, and stay out all  day. We   d take our lunch with us and herd those cattle on the grasslands.  Then we owned a field about three or four miles from our house. My mother  would take the youngest ones in the buggy and stay out all day with their lunch  and herd those cattle.  We   ve heard a lot about the open range cattle operations, and I don   t  understand how that works. If you let your cows out, how do you get them  back in?  You herded them with a horse.  Herded them.  You just followed them around all day out around the range? So they wouldn   t  just go out and wander around on their own.  No.  Okay, that   s what I wasn   t getting.  The neighbors got to talking about what if that happened  laughter . My dad  homesteaded on a place, and then my mother homesteaded on one about four  miles from there. She had to live on it so many months out of the year, so she  did in the summer time in a little house there. She and the younger ones would  stay there. Then my brother and I would drive the buggy. Every morning  we   d go up there and take butter and milk, because they didn   t have  refrigerators. Then we   d come home to do the chores, and she   d stay up there  those three months.  20  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Elms  Lemons  Elms  Cline  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Keeping that claim.  Keeping the claim.  Well sometimes people talk about other people that were leaving their houses  and an increase of tramps or hobos or bums heading through the countryside.  Do you guys have any memories or tramps stopping by?  I don   t.  We had lots of gypsies and tramps going by our house. We had a main route,  maybe I should say, for them to take home to Boise City. They were walking  of course, and my dad had fed many of them. The thing that I wondered how  in the world we did is he let them sleep in on the living room floor. He   d take  them in. Most of us slept upstairs. Those gypsies or the tramps, he   d let them  sleep there that night. Boy you wouldn   t do that now.  As a child, did that cause any anxiety for you, thinking there were strangers  sleeping downstairs?  Usually it excited us. We thought gypsies, what were they, where were these  people from. We never thought about not letting them stay.  There were two different families out there that just walked out, just left their  house and walked out, moved. That   s when the dirt got so bad.  I don   t remember any gypsies ever going through our country, but I can  remember, as a child, hearing about them. That was a fear that I always had  was gypsies.  Did your mother ever tell you the gypsies would get you?  No, but suddenly I was just scared of gypsies.  I don   t know, my dad, I thought, was too friendly with people like that   laughing . I guess he felt sorry for them. He treated them with respect, and I  wonder sometimes how he got by.  Did they ever do work around the place?  Yes, sometimes they would help or offer to, but he very seldom had them do  anything. He usually just sent them on their way after he kept them over night.  Do any of you remember people sleeping on your living room floors or the  barn?  No, I don   t.  It seems like it all depended on where your house was situated.  21  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Clifton  Kite  Cline  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  I think that was it. We were right by the road. As I said, it was kind of a mail  route from Texhoma to Boise City. People went that way.  You said you remember two families just getting up and moving out, walking  out one day. How was their situation any different from yours?  What we had, we stayed with it. They just walked out and left their furniture  and everything.  You were living in a two-room shack, what did you have there that made you  stay?  We didn   t have any money to live on, so we just stayed.  Stayed and shoveled it out. It took some tenacity. I don   t know how you guys  did it. Do you remember, in the communities or the churches, any  organizations or drives that would help collect clothes or food or things for the  needy?  I don   t.  I really don   t. Maybe we just helped each other and didn   t know it.  Do you remember any people working for the New Deal programs, the WPA,  or the Roosevelt programs?  Yeah, Carl worked on that. He helped build roads.  When I started to college at Goodwell, they had the NYA, the National Youth  Administration. I was the first to go to college, so I applied for the NYA. I  had the job of working at the cafeteria. I think two weeks of school had gone  by and the president of the college came down one day. He said,    I hate to tell  you this, but you have been turned down. You cannot get NYA because your  dad owns too much land.    Well yes, my dad owned land, but that was the time  when we weren   t getting any crops. We hadn   t had a crop that year. My  reaction was I just sat down and started bawling, because I wanted to go to  college. The next day he came down and he said,    Since you   re such a good  cafeteria worker, we   re going to let you have your room and board,    so I  worked for my room and board. I guess that was my paying job.  Yeah it was.  I worked for other families when they had new babies. I helped take care of  the rest of the family. Just around different places. Sometimes I ended up  getting a dollar or a dollar and a half.  Mrs. Clifton, do you have any memories of the WPA, the Work Progress  Administration, or any of the New Deal programs?  22  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Cline  Kite  Elms  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Elms  Cline  Elms  Cline  No, I can   t remember that my dad worked on it. I remember him working on  the road. It seems like he would leave early Monday morning. Have you ever  been on 287 to Amarillo?  No.  Down to the Beaver River, probably ten miles from home. They   d send the  wheat down there working with the horses, camping out. They took feed food  for the week. They helped to build that road, the beginning of it. It   s now a  highway, but that   s where they worked with their Fresnos. Horses, no tractors.  Horses pulled gizmos to dig up the dirt with.  Labored early morning until late at night, away from home. The children took  care of the chores at home. They weren   t paid much, I   m sure. I don   t know if  that was WPA or not. It was a work project, county maybe.  It sounds like you guys or your families were pro Roosevelt at least. I know  that sometimes his policies divided a lot of families or counties.  I don   t remember much about politics.  Sometimes they   d have the livestock slaughtered and they   d pay for that.  Yeah, I remember that.  I do too.  That was terrible, but I don   t know how else you could feed them. You didn   t  have food for them.  Did your parents have to have that done?  Yeah, they had to have a few done.  And yours as well?  No. We were married at that time, but we never did have to.  Another big thing they had as a child was rabbit drives. We had lots of rabbits.  Yes.  I can remember the drives.  Well the rabbits were just eating everything. They were just so thick that they  had to get rid of them.  23  Kite  Cline  Clifton  Cline  Clifton  Cline  Clifton  Elms  Cline  Lemons  Cline  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Cline  Elms  Clifton  Cline  Clifton  Kite  Cline  Clifton  I   ve heard about these, and it doesn   t seem like at pretty sight to be in on.  It wasn   t a very pretty sight when they killed them, no.  They used clubs, didn   t they?  Yes.  They beat them as they bunched them up.  They   d go in and beat them with clubs.  Slaughtered the rabbits.  I never did help with them, but I   ve watched them in the distance, how they   d  drive them.  I have pictures of them.  You have pictures of the rabbit drive?  Yes.  Were you involved in rabbit drives Mrs. Clifton?  I remember going to one. It was at a home. I remember one time, I went with  my dad.  Was that seen as work or entertainment? It seems like it kind of crosses the  line.  Entertainment I guess, but they had to get rid of the rabbits  laughing .  There was a lot of work to it.  Didn   t they want to get rid of the rabbits?  Yeah, the rabbits were taking all the grass and weeds and all from the cows.  They needed vegetation for the cattle.  You mentioned going down and collecting weeds for your cows, the thistles  and yucca plants and everything else.  Yeah, we did.  Anything that cattle would eat. The thistles weren   t very plentiful, but yucca  was on the ranch land south of us.  24  Cline  Kite  Elms  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Clifton  You   d chop it up, and the old cows would chew on it.  Well do you remember when things started to get better for you all? Do you  remember signs that things were kind of turning around a little bit and  prosperity might have been coming or closer? Maybe changes in the way you  lived.  Well, when then rains finally came, and they got farming so that we didn   t  have as many dust storms. I would say about the time that I went to college  that took place. In    38, I think.  I don   t remember when, but things just made a turn for the better.  You don   t remember getting something or being able to buy something?  Probably when we were able to buy a car  laughing .  A car. Maybe buy some store bought bread   Oh yeah.  Isn   t that funny how now it   s the homemade bread that   s the luxurious item?  Yes, that   s right. You   re right.  And for you it was just the opposite.  We had a girl here at the school that carried her sandwich of bologna and  bought bread. I thought she was the most wonderful person  laughter .  Well that was the only time I can remember having two pairs of shoes; I  thought how special that was that I got a new pair of shoes.  How old were you when you got your second pair?  I can see those shoes yet. Probably ten, I don   t know.  Well let   s hear about the shoes that you can see.  I had a second pair of shoes.  What were they like? What was your second pair of shoes like?  They were rust colored, if I remember, suede, and ordered from National  Bellis and Hess. Do you remember?  Oh yes, I remember National Bellis and Hess.  Sears and Montgomery Ward. That   s all the shopping places, what little we  25  Cline  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Cline  Elms  Clifton  Cline  Elms  Cline  Elms  did.  Everybody did their shopping through catalogs.  National Bellis and Hess.  And Hess.  That was the catalog that you ordered everything from?  It was smaller than Montgomery Ward and Sears.  You   d mail order things from them just like you would the others?  That   s right.  You couldn   t wait for that order to come for a new catalog to look at.  That   s a good memory of a kind of return to better times.  That was one of the signs, probably, of better times.  Besides a lot more work in the fields, a lot of rain and whatnot.  That shoe business was quite a problem. I wore shoes to school. What I   d  wear to dress up in for church, I   d take those shoes to wear to school, and then  get a new pair of dress shoes. That   s the reason that my feet give out on me is  because my shoes didn   t fit. You know, when you were growing. My shoes  were usually patent leather with one button on it, for a dress shoe. Then I wore  high-top shoes to school. It took a little gizmo to button my shoes.  A buttonhook.  Buttonhole.  Buttonhook.  Buttonhook.  Buttonhook.  Yeah, I   ve still got one.  My dad, when the Thompson   s store sold out here in Boise City   you  remember them don   t you, the Thompson   s store? He came up here and  bought a pair of high-top shoes, lace, for me. They were pointed toes. He  brought them home and had my mother cut the top off and button hole stitch  around it. I had to wear those to school, and I thought that was the end of the  world.  Laughter   26  Cline  Elms  Cline  Lemons  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Cline  Kite  Cline  Clifton  Elms  Kite  Cline  My dad went to town when the store was selling out. They had a whole box  full of shoes, just every kind of shoes, boys and girls and all. He bought the  whole box full brought them home. I had to wear boy   s shoes for the next year  or two.  Laughter   I know how you felt.  Kids just go crazy to get a pair of those old heavy shoes.  Laughter   Do you know how much he had to pay for that box of shoes?  I don   t know.  That pair of shoes I got cost a quarter.  You probably got a box of shoes for a dollar or something like that.  Probably so.  Probably did. There were several pairs of shoes in it, and of course we all had  to pick out what sizes we could wear.  Laughter  I had to wear a pair of boy   s  shoes.  That   s funny. A couple of ladies in the last group were talking about how their  fathers understood about the dust and plowing up too much land and were  trying to keep other people from plowing up land that shouldn   t have been  plowed up. Do you remember any thoughts like that going on with your  families or that coming up in family discussions at all?  I don   t think so.  I don   t.  Yes, I can remember that because we would have people move in that wasn   t  familiar with the dirt storms and they would plow up grass. My dad just  thought that was terrible. We had a lot of grass pasture for the cattle. That   s  why we herded the cattle was because of the grass. When somebody would  come in and plow up grass, then your land would blow if they didn   t use other  methods of controlling the dirt.  I was starting to think about how often you   d have to do laundry, because your  clothes would be so dirty because of the sand and the dust. What was a typical  laundry procedure like? Did you have motorized washing machines at this  time or was it still scrubbing?  My folks didn   t, but Carl   s folks always had a motorized washing machine.  After I was married, we always had a motorized washing machine. When I  was at home I didn   t. We rubbed on the board.  27  Kite  Elms  Clifton  Elms  Kite  Lemons  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Elms  Lemons  Yeah. And then hang it out to dry.  We washed in a separate building, and my dad bought a wash pot, we called it.  It was bigger around than this table. We heated it. It was over a deal where  we built a fire under it and heated our water. The first remembrance was the  scrub board. Then we got that plunger. It was a deal and you pumped it down  on the clothes. We boiled the white clothes in that water. Then we   d take  them out and put them into tubs. We had two rinse waters for the clothes.  Then we got the kind you turned this way.  Hagge. Do you remember Hagge washer?  All I remember is this one. There was never a mechanized washing machine  at my house until after I went to college.  You   ve been awful quiet about laundry.  What   s a Hagge washing machine?  Hagge, you had to crank it with your foot, I think, and maybe pull something.  Sometimes it   d start and sometimes it wouldn   t  laughter . My mother had  one of those, not too many years. Something like Maytag.  Oh yeah, gasoline powered.  Yes.  They got one after I left home.  After the boiler, washboard.  I can   t imagine having to go through your procedure with all of the dust.  After I got married, we had the gasoline motor, I guess. I remember washing  baby   s diapers and boiling them on the stove, so we didn   t have a mechanized  washer until after my children were born.  Today you just throw it in, push a button, and come back. Then throw it in the  dryer and come back later.  That   s too easy.  Oh no. I still have a hard time with it, clothes changing color and everything.  Well things have really changed I   ll tell you. They really have.  I   ll pose this to each of you, how do you think having lived through that has  effected you today? What is something you do today that you think probably  28  Kite  Cline  Elms  Cline  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Cline  Kite  Elms  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Cline  Elms  comes from having lived through this kind of thing?  Like a long-term effect.  We learned how to work  laughter , work instead of play all the time.  I really think it made me, even today, appreciate what I have more than if I  hadn   t of gone through that time. I appreciate my stacked washer and dryer  and the fact that I don   t have to go outside to wash the clothes. The way we  cook, we always had a wood-burning stove to cook on. Then my mother got a  coal stove. The same way with ironing. We ironed by heating the iron on the  burner and then took it over to the table with a quilt spread on it, then you did  the ironing, and then it got cold and you went back and got another one. I  never will forget when we got electricity and got an electric iron. Thought it  was the most wonderful thing.  That was the first thing we bought, was an electric iron.  What we have now, I appreciate thinking about what we did have.  That   s right. It does make us appreciate things more. I think it probably  helped us to be more thrifty and not want to be wasteful and appreciate what  we have now.  Were you ever afraid to put your money in banks?  No.  You always hear stories about people burying their money in the backyard and  whatnot. I   ve never met anybody that did.  You didn   t have any to bury.  Well no.  Oh yeah, I forgot about that.  We sure didn   t have any extra. If you had penny you were lucky. You just  notice so many people now that if they saw a penny they wouldn   t stop to pick  it up.  Boy I do.  I do, yes.  Laughter  A penny   s a penny.  One Christmas Santa Claus brought us a little metal bank. He brought my  brother and me one. Mine was gold and his was black. You put nickels,  dimes and quarters in. It wouldn   t take anything else. You   d put them in that  little slot and pull the lever. It stayed there until it got full   I think it held ten  29  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Elms  Kite  Clifton  dollars   then it   d pop open at the bottom. We still have those banks. That   s  how we saved our money.  Are you still waiting to get up to ten dollars?  Yeah.  Laughter  I know one of my brothers decided that he could pry it open  and get it out, but he never could get it open. It just had to pop open. Now  that   s the only bank I remember.  Well if you can look back to that time period and kind of think what one image  or what one memory of that period sums up the dirty thirties more than  anything else to you. What would that be?  I think neighbors visited more then. Heavens, there wasn   t a week that went  by that a group would gather together in one another   s house. We   d play cards  and have potted meat sandwiches or something and coffee. We just really  enjoyed ourselves. We   d go to different neighbors. I think people did visit  more than they do now.  Do you remember what card games you   d play?  It was usually pitch. I don   t know what other name you   d give it; we always  called it pitch.  That was my grandmother   s favorite game.  But we did, of course we   d draw names to have partners and change around.  We did a lot of visiting that way.  Socializing and whatnot.  Yes, and now a days they don   t have time.  Do you guys have any specific memories that stick out more than any others?  Talking about the dust bowl days, I just don   t think I   ll ever forget how dirty I  got coming to school in Boise and the wind blowing everyday, and then the  black duster. That   s a thing that I   ll never forget. There are good things like  she was telling, but that   s something that was foremost in my memory.  Everybody seems like they always have one something that sticks out in their  head more than others. What about you Mrs. Clifton, what are your most vivid  memories of that time period?  Oh, my family. I wouldn   t like to go back to those times, but they were good,  they were good. I think of how my parents sacrificed. I   m sure they did. We  suffered through the dust storms. My mother died of emphazema, which was  probably caused by the dust storms. That was their life. They moved to this  country, and they never thought of leaving, I   m sure. It was home.  30  Kite  Elms  Kite  DAU  Elms  Kite  Elms  Clifton  Elms  Clifton  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Elms  Some of you have mentioned dust pneumonia or health problems. Do you  remember that being pretty wide spread?  The funeral we attended on Black Sunday was a grandmother and her great  granddaughter. The granddaughter was nine months old and died of dust  pneumonia. They had a double funeral that day. I   ll always remember that,  that she died of dust pneumonia. Several did.  Shelly, can you think of anything else?  You might ask them about the prairie fires and the bedbugs and the rats.  I thought about that. We had prairie fires, and everybody gathered around to  fight them. I remember that.  Just widespread out of control fires?  They   d plow with their horses, and plow so the fire wouldn   t jump across the  plowed ground. They   d take potato sacks and wet them and fight the fire. I  always hated to see that blaze in the distance.  I don   t remember any prairie fires.  You don   t, well we had them.  We lived not far from ranch country, but I don   t remember any prairie fires.  Here I started to school, we went to a different school the first year. It was  northeast of our house, and it was all prairie. We rode with the lady who  taught the school. One day she didn   t come back. I don   t think I went to  school that day, but my brother did. They looked out the window at this red  deal, and they knew it was fire. They began hurrying around to go find the car  because they were late getting home. They figured the car was on fire and all  the stuff. Before they got ready to leave, the moon came up.  Laughter  You  know how sometimes the edge of it looks red?  Right.  It wasn   t a fire. I never will forget how excited everybody got.  They were ready to go beat that moon out. You mentioned bed bugs and rats.  Yeah, we   ve always had a lot of them.  My dad brought a folding bed from Mississippi. It was a piece of furniture. It  folded up, and then you unfolded it and the mattress and everything was  inside. That was the most wonderful thing. It was a room saver, but that thing  got bed bugs in it because it was wood. He moved that thing out of the house,  31  Cline  Kite  Elms  Clifton  Elms  Clifton  Cline  Elms  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Cline  Clifton  Cline  Kite  Cline  Clifton  Cline  and we never had a wooden bed in our house until after I left home. He got  metal beds because he didn   t want the bed bugs. The wooden beds, he said,  was what brought the bed bugs in.  That would make a difference.  How would you get rid of them besides dragging your bed outside?  We had, I don   t know whether they did or not, but our mattress was corn  shucks. We had corn shuck mattresses. Those bugs would get in the edge of  where you stitched the material. Many a day that I had, I guess it was coal oil.  Kerosene.  And we   d pick those bugs off and drop them in there and get rid of them.  Every Saturday morning, I think, we did that. We got the kerosene and a  chicken feather.  We used wheat straws. For a mattress we   d use wheat straw.  We used corn shucks. Then you put a feather bed on top of that.  We didn   t have the feather beds.  Laughter   You were just sleeping right on the wheat straw.  We usually had quilts.  We had geese one time. We   d pick the geese feathers off and make pillows  and mattresses out of them. You   d do it before you killed them.  I think we did that some, yes.  What ever happened to bedbugs? Did they finally become an endangered  species, I guess?  I don   t want to know. Endangered species   Laughter   You killed them all.  I hope.  Every time mother made the beds, she got out the Four-leaf 40 and sprayed  down on the floor and around the beds and the beds and the mattress. Wasn   t  it Four-leaf 40?  No, it was an insecticide. Anyway, it was a Four-leaf 40.  32  Clifton  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Cline  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Clifton  Kite  Lemons  Clifton  You would have to tear the bed apart.  Yes, because there were little old crevices.  Did you have Saturday morning bedbug hunting parties?  No. It was usually all the time.  Laughter   It never stopped.  Had you had anybody mention bedbugs before?  Everybody had them.  This is unique.  Anybody that said they   d never had them, I just kind of wonder about them.   Laughter   You question that.  Laughter   Great stories.  Then of course, rats moved in there for a year or two. They were everywhere.  We fought them for I don   t know how long. We tried to smoke them out.  We   ve done everything.  Were there more rats in there because of the wind and the dust? Do you think  that drove them inside?  I don   t know what did. They were in all your out buildings and everything.  There were always rats. If you had grain or anything, then that   s probably  what they were hunting. We had them for several years. We just fought them.  They   d get in with the little chickens and kill them all. They couldn   t kill big  chickens, but they would your little ones.  How did you get rid of them?  I don   t know. They finally just left.  They smoked them out and put water into the holes and us kids beat them to  death.  Laughter   Mini rabbit drives.  Practice.  They   d get in your food. You had to keep it in large tin cans to keep them out  of it.  33  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Lemons  Elms  Kite  Elms  Cline  Elms  Cline  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Clifton  It sounds like a problem.  They chewed on our cupboard doors.  You didn   t have any problems until you had skunks.  Well that   s right.  Under the granary, and we had to get them out. We buried lots of clothes   laughter . You buried clothes to get the scent out of the clothes.  You   d dig them back up again and they   d be okay smelling?  That   s what they said. We   d wash them and they   d be all right.  That dirt   s some good stuff. It kills infections and gets the skunk smell out of  your clothes  laughter .  Well my mother made skunk oil out of those skunks.  What would you do with skunk oil?  Rub it on the bottom of our feet  laughter .  That   s true.  Rubbing skunk oil on the bottom of our feet kept us from having colds.  I   ve heard that, but we didn   t try that  laughing .  It was only Vicks on the bottom of our feet.  You   d advanced a little bit. You had evolved a little bit.  Well we wore asafedita around our necks too, did you?  I remember that. I remember that.  What is that?  Poor old Zed, he just put that on the kids all the time and made them wear it.  What   s asafedita?  It was all black.  And chew on it  laughing .  34  Elms  Kite  Clifton  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Cline  Elms  Cline  Clifton  Kite  Elms  It was just a medication that they came out with.  What was the purpose?  To ward off the colds.  Diseases.  And it was on a necklace or on something you   d wear?  Well, you put it on a string.  Was it hard like a rock? And you would chew on it, that   s what you would do.  Were you supposed to chew on it?  You were supposed to, but if you could get out of not doing it, you did.  It tasted bad?  Yes.  The smell was enough to turn you off.  Did you have that too?  Yes.  I   ve never heard of that before.  Her grandpa made her wear it  laughing .  Do you know how it was spelled?  I read something the other day about that. Evidently, it   s still known, but not  used, surely. Asphidity.  How do you spell that?  I never had to spell it. I just had to wear it.  You might find that in a dictionary, I don   t know.  You might.  Ask a doctor, they may know.  They might just laugh. That   s crazy. But I guess if it worked it worked.  I don   t know whether it worked or not.  35  Cline  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Clifton  Kite  Elms  Cline  Clifton  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Cline  Kite  I don   t either. If you thought it did, it helped.  That   s right, it   s all in your mind maybe, if you   re thinking sucking on that  black stuff made you better.  You put it on in the fall, didn   t you?  Would everyone in school have that on?  And in the winter, along with long underwear.  All your friends would wear that?  I suppose so. I don   t remember.  Whether they all had to or not, some of them did.  You got rid of it every chance you got.  Well, I think I   ve covered all the topics, plus a few more that I hadn   t before   That last one   s a new one.  All right, well is there anything else you   d like to add?  Well I don   t know. This would pertain to the dust bowl I guess, but Carl   s dad  and my dad came to this country together. They didn   t live too close together,  but they came from north of Oklahoma City, Marshall County, and they came  to this country together when they filed, and then they moved out of here.  Then Carl and I lived out there over 60 years together, just within ten miles of  where we were both born.  Wow, talk about roots.  So that was home out there.  Is your two-room house still standing?  No, it   s gone. It   s been gone, and I can   t even remember when we tore it  down. I was so glad to get rid of it  laughter .  You didn   t make a note of it, did you?  No.  Well, if you remember anything else, or if looking through these questions or  subjects makes you think of something else, I   d like you to call Mrs. Randolph  or Mrs. Young and let them know, and we can call you from Stillwater. It   d be  36  Cline  Kite  Clifton  Cline  Clifton  Kite  Cline  Kite  Cline  Elms  Kite  Elms  Kite  Cline  Kite  Elms  free for you, and we could just talk to you some more. It   d be really helpful to  us.  You   d better wait until you get this deciphered  laughter .  Well sometime you don   t think of things    til you get home, like I even forget  questions that I want to ask you, so if you think of something else, just be sure  and let somebody here know, and they can get in touch with us, and that   d be  great.  Well one question here, what was the general consensus for the cause of the  dust storms? Well, it was the lack of moisture, I would think.  That was the big item.  That was the main thing, not so much the farming practices at that time, but I  believe it was the lack of moisture, and the wind, constant.  A couple of people have talked about going a year without rain as no big deal.  When it did rain, it seemed like it was always just a big heavy rain, you know.  It   d just all fall at once, and then it   d run off.  And be gone.  Creeks and rivers got up so high, and when they ran down, the water was gone.  There was nothing to hold it.  Yeah, that   s another thing too.  And that   s where the farming practices then came in too.  Well, we   re going to type up the transcript of the tape, and send one to each of  you to look through, and you can make corrections or delete some things or  whatever you chose to do.  About the bedbugs.  We   re not taking that out  laughter . Then the final copy will be sent to you  and the heritage center here, and we   ll keep a copy at Oklahoma State  University, as well as the tape. The tape will be at OSU as well, so we   ll have  a record of all of this, and a record will be kept for future use. I   d just like to  say thanks to you guys.  Well, I   ve enjoyed it. They   ve told about things I hadn   t heard.  -------  -------
