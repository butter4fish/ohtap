 Lemons  Allen  Hollowell  Kite  Allen  Kite  Allen  Okay, if everybody could state their name around the table so I can keep track  of who   s talking when.  I   m Ruth Hollowell.  Would you mind telling us when you were born and where you were born?  Oh, I was born April 3, 1916 in Missouri.  There are lots of Missouri people in Boise City.  Yeah. You run into a lot of them.  I   m Marietta Foreman. I was born the August 24, 1922.  Here in Boise City?  Barber County, Kansas.  And last, but not least, number three.  I   m Fern McDaniel Allen, and I was born near Bertrand in Cimarron County,  March 9, 1916; just slightly older than Mrs. Hollowell.  A whole month and six days.  Oh, we   ve got another.  I heard another voice.  You   re the only native of the area here today then. You were born right here,  the only person that was born here.  I went to Hawaii once, we did for ten days, and that   s about all I   ve ever been  out of Cimarron County  laughter .  5  Kite  Allen  Lemons  Kite  Lemons  McCune  Lemons  McCune  Kite  McCune  Kite  Hollowell  Kite  Hollowell  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Hollowell  Kite  Wow  You chose a long way to go.  Well, it was a farm program.  I think you know everybody here. This is Steve.  So we have number four here.  Mrs. McCune, we kind of went around the table, and everyone said their  birthday and when they were born, so if you don   t mind telling us.  I was born April 2, 1913.  Here in Cimarron County?  In Texas County, just over the line.  You   re still a foreigner though, I guess  laughter .  Yeah, I   m a foreigner.  All right, well these talks are very informal. There   s no structure to them  really. We just kind of want to run through some of the topics on these pages.  They   re in no particular order. We don   t have to go down a line or anything,  just as we bring up a topic, you can talk about what you remember about that  or what you think about that. Well when did you grow up in this area?  In 1919, and I was in Texas County too, until    43.  Oh okay, so you were only three then when you came.  I wasn   t quite three. We came in February. I don   t remember anything about  Missouri.  Let   s see, who else was not born here?  I came from Kansas in 1930, March.  So a fairly latecomer then, coming into the dirty thirties.  Well, it wasn   t what I   d call dirty then. That happened in    33 and    34, and on.  Yeah. We   ve had some people talk about the rain that was here in    31, how it  was a wet season then, and then it dried up real fast. Were all of you growing  up in a rural area, in farming lives?  Rural.  No town people here today?  6  Allen  Foreman  Hollowell  Kite  Hollowell  McCune  Kite  McCune  Kite  McCune  Allen  Lemons  McCune  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  Hollowell  Kite  No plumbing.  Yeah, no plumbing, farmers.  Yeah, my folks were farmers also.  Was that very far away from here or outside of the area?  In Texas County.  I was born and raised six miles east of the Griggs Store. Do you know where  the Griggs Store is?  I don   t know where that is.  It   s about twenty-five miles southeast of here.  Oh, so quite a ways away from here then.  About twenty-five miles.  That   s not far. I drove twenty-six miles to get here this morning.  I guess. Well see, I   ve never been to the panhandle before, so I was just  looking around at everything, so different I don   t know where I was.  Well that   s close to where I was raised.  She and I were raised not too far apart.  Well, so were we.  Well, one of the things we do sometimes is to talk about a typical day, as you  were growing up in your farming area, what a typical day would have been  like for you all. If you remember the twenties and thirties, what a typical day  might have included for you? What would you have done between waking up  and going to sleep?  I always got up, and we milked ten or twelve cows, my sisters and I, and then  we had a cream separator that we   d run the milk through to get the cream out,  hand-turned  laughing . Then we had some calves that were bucket fed, so  when we got the milk run through the separator, then we   d take it and feed the  calves. By that time, we were ready to have breakfast. If it was during school  term, then we had to hurry to get ready to go to school. We walked a mile to  school.  Does that sound familiar to everybody else?  7  Foreman  Kite  McCune  Kite  McCune  Kite  McCune  Kite  McCune  Lemons  Well, I was raised a little different, because I was an only child. My dad  farmed with horses to a great extent. With me, I got up at 5:30 in the morning,  took the saddle horse, and went and hunted the horses. I had a fair idea of  where they would be, but this is what you call open range. As a kid, I knew  where the best forage was, so I   d go get the horses, bring them in, and in the  meantime, my dad would put the feed out for the horses and the cows. Then  we milked and then same thing, separated the milk. By the time that was done,  I looked to see if the school bus was coming. If we had what I call a good  driver. I only lived about three-quarters of a mile from school, and the law  was you had to be two miles or more, or you walked, so if we had a bus driver  that was nice, I could watch for the bus, run down to the road, and ride.  Otherwise, I had to start out and walk.  To this day, my husband can   t understand me and breakfast. I never sat down  to a breakfast table until I got to college  laughter . There were too many  things to do and eat my breakfast, when I went to school, my mom insisted on  a glass of milk, and then anything that might be left over from the day before,  whether it was a potato, a piece of meat, and I stood up and ate it and watched  for the bus. My mother put up my lunch to go to school while I was doing  these other things, but I wasn   t raised like other kids. I was the only one.  What about you two and your morning chores or daily routine?  Well, when it was school time, I had to get up and ride my pony four and a  half miles to school, North Fork School, every morning, and it was northeast  of the home place, so we had to face the north winds four and a half miles to  school on the pony. Red Wing was her name.  Was your pony   s name?  Yeah.  Wow   I rode that pony for eight years, going to grade school at that little North Fork  schoolhouse.  I bet the pony would know its way there.  It sure did know its way. It got kind of contrary, and my brother, who   s just  older than me by a couple of years, he rode a larger horse, and when I had to  go for some reason without him, when I   d get to the first gate, I   d get off and  open that gate, and that pony would stand there and rare up, and I couldn   t  make her go. Sometimes I   d have to go clear back home to get through that  gate with my pony, get someone to take her through. She   d just stand there  and rare up, because she knew I couldn   t make her go like my brother did.  She was a contrary pony.  8  McCune  Kite  Allen  Kite  Allen  Kite  Hollowell  McCune  Hollowell  McCune  Kite  Hollowell  McCune  Foreman  McCune  Hollowell  Allen  She was spoiled.  What about you and your days?  Well, in my grade school, we just lived a mile. By 1930, I started to high  school at Felt, and that was eight miles away, and Daddy had to take us to  meet the bus by that time. All the time before, not anything like a bus in my  district. Everybody rode horses or drove a wagon and team or walked, and we  just lived a mile, so we walked. By 1930 I started to high school, and I had to  ride the bus, but I can   t remember that daddy milked cows, but I don   t think he  had us get up and help him milk in the wintertime, but we always had a big  breakfast. Mama cooked. We always had hogs to butcher. We had biscuits  and gravy.  Did you sit down when you ate it?  Yes, and we all sat together and ate around the table.  What was a typical breakfast like for everybody else?  Well we usually had bacon and eggs and sometimes gravy and bread of some  kind.  We did too.  We always liked to eat.  We always did too. We always had breakfast, a good breakfast every morning,  lots of times biscuits and gravy.  Were there any evening chores, or when you   d come home from school, were  there things that had to be done in the evening?  The milking had to be done all over again.  Gather the eggs and feed the chickens.  Bring in the coal and fill the coal oil lamps.  Yeah, fill the lights. That   s right.  Fill the water reservoir on the home comfort cook stove, and carry it from the  windmill.  We had to bring in cobs for starting the fire, and sometimes burning to keep  the fire going. Daddy did have some corn and shelled the corn, so we had  cobs. In the evening, we walked after the cows mostly, my brother and I. He  was four years younger than I was, but we were kind of partners, and we  walked after the cows, and then we milked the cows. Generally we had four or  9  Kite  Allen  Hollowell  Foreman  Allen  Foreman  Kite  Allen  Foreman  Allen  Foreman  five, and of course we sold cream. That was part of our living. In 1930, my  dad built a chicken house that was big. It would hold 200 hens.  That sounds big.  It was made out of adobe. He made the adobe and had a rock foundation.  Sometimes people wonder how we made it, but we had incubators in the  cellar. There were about four or five, and Mama would hatch maybe 2,000  chickens in the spring, and we   d sell the roosters. Sometimes we got a quarter  a piece for them, or something like that, or sometimes twenty-five cents a  pound, but whenever they got to be about two pounds, that was pretty good  market for them, and then kept the hens, the pullets.  So besides having big garden spots, of course when the sand got to blowing,  we had tow sacks all around the fence of the garden to kind of protect that.  You couldn   t have too awful much. I mean you   d plant it, and then a  sandstorm would come along. I   m talking too much here, but we had two  different kinds of sandstorms. You know, I think a lot of these, like this, think  about the rolling kind that came in. Well what we had, the fellow right across  the road from us, broke out a half section of grassland, which Daddy begged  him not to do, because he knew. He said,    Well if I ever get able, I   ll buy it.     Well, he never would have gotten able. Anyway, he broke it out, so from the  southwest, every time the wind got up just a little bit from the southwest, it   d  just sweep right across, because we were just right across the road from that.  Sometimes the wind would get high enough, and the land was sandy enough  that it would blow. But, there wasn   t one of those rolling sandstorms ever.  Like the Black Sunday.  Yeah, what you   re saying is what we all contended with, that you literally  blew under them. Maybe the dirt wasn   t over that high.  Yeah, it was just a sweeping.  It covered, yeah it just swept.  Did you even see it coming in? Was it noticeable when it was coming?  Well, you know how the wind does. In the morning, it just gradually gets up.  Builds.  And then it goes down after sundown or something like that, and that   s just a  typical day.  And I don   t know whether you folks realize, they   d plow this land, and if there  was a sub-soiler   that was what you had behind your plow to drop the seed in  that extra little slit   it would just sweep it, and you   d have these little sub-soiler  marks out in your field. So then the next year, they plowed again, and it  10  Allen  Foreman  Kite  McCune  Foreman  McCune  Foreman  Allen  Foreman  Hollowell  McCune  Kite  Foreman  Hollowell  Allen  went down that much deeper.  Well, if there was some rain to plow with. There were a few years there where  there weren   t any.  Well that   s true too. I   m from Kansas, but did we ever cuss the Kansans,  because they were suitcase farmers. They would come in, and that started  about    27 where we were, and plowed this land, and they got a good return on  their wheat crops, so boy, we bought some more, I don   t mean we did, but they  did, and plowed another section, as she says. Then they   d go back to Kansas.  They   d plant it, maybe they had the moisture maybe they didn   t, but they   d  plant it, and they   d leave. The people that still lived here endured the dirt,  because sometimes it didn   t rain.  Do you guys remember the suitcase farmers, the absentee farmers and things  like that?  Yes, I kind of remember that.  I   ll bet you do.  I   m older than she is  laughing .  But the trouble is, we suffered from that, because we were from Kansas, and  most of those suitcase farmers were from Kansas, but we weren   t suitcase  farmers. We were stuck with it.  But you were still from Kansas.  But we were still from Kansas, and it was a stigma.  Right in the community where we lived, we didn   t have very many suitcase  farmers. Most people were there, and were just our neighbors.  Most people owned their land. My dad owned his land.  I   ve heard a lot written about the absentee owners and how they weren   t very  well liked.  They weren   t. Well this is kind of off of the subject, but my husband said that,  I still call them suitcase farmers, came out,    Somebody stole my combine and  my tractor last winter while I was gone.    His dad said,    No, there they are,  and he took him out to two sand dunes  laughter , and just part of the grain bin  of this combine was sticking out, and I think some little part, maybe the  exhaust, was sticking out on the tractor, but they were still where he left them.  It sure covered things up all right.  Well in the country where she and I lived was really sandy. It was real sandy.  11  Hollowell  Allen  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  McCune  Kite  McCune  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  McCune  No, it wasn   t very sandy where I lived.  It was tighter ground, wasn   t it? It was just sand enough. We had drifts three  to four feet around our house, and every time the wind blew, they   d change  whether they were taller.  They   d just shift. If you   ve ever been to the sand dunes up here in Colorado or  White Sands, they move. Our land did the same thing. It   d be one place today  and some place else tomorrow.  So you two were north?  We were west.  Northwest of where we are now. Is that right?  I   m a half a mile from where I was born. Not born, raised.  You guys were south. Is that right, south?  Southeast of Boise City about twenty-five miles.  Maybe fifty miles separated you all, and in that space, you   ve got totally  different experiences.  Now you go out that way, there   s tighter land in spots. Some sections will be  fairly tight, or parts of it, and then parts of it will be so sandy that you just  can   t   even nowadays when we do no-till farming and things like that   you  can   t fertilize too much in that sand, because sometimes fertilizer will, if it  rains, it just goes on down, it doesn   t do your crop any good, in sand.  But you mentioned your house like this. I should have brought that picture  that I took of Floyd Jacobs    house. My friend   s house, all it shows is the roof.  It was completely around their house. You went over this sand dune, and there  was a spot, what would you say Fern, three to four feet out from the house, all  the way around the house that you could walk on hard dirt. I bet there   s a  picture of that around here, because I took the picture, but I had it developed at  the drugstore down here, and apparently they saw it, and it went all over the  country.  So much for your privacy  laughing    Well yeah, and I didn   t care, but it was such an unusual picture, and people  knew the locality. I was closer to where she lived than where I lived.  You guys didn   t have the dunes around your house like that?  Some, but not as bad as they did out west of Boise.  12  Hollowell  McCune  Kite  Foreman  Kite  McCune  Foreman  Hollowell  Kite  Hollowell  Foreman  McCune  Allen  Foreman  Allen  Kite  Allen  Foreman  Allen  But we did. Sometimes it would drift kind of like snow does when the snow  drifts. There   d be little sand piles and things around.  We had sandstorms and blown out crops.  Do you remember, like she was talking about, how people would ask other  farmers not to plow up this land, do you remember that?  I sure do.  Do you remember that going on, like if a farmer said,    I   m breaking out this  section,    would the community get together or would somebody say, hey don   t  do it, it   s not a good idea?  Please leave the grass.  But it was theirs, they had a right, and they did it.  Don   t you think that   s what caused the dust?  That   s kind of what I was thinking.  Because too many people broke out ground that shouldn   t ever have been  broke out.  Yes, that   s it.  They didn   t know how to take care of it to keep it from blowing.  When the tractors came along, about 1929 or    30     They could cover more acres.  That   s when they started breaking it out, with just horses. Daddy always  farmed with horses until that time. After that time, he didn   t do much farming,  I think  laughing . He did trade his horses for a tractor, which was a bad  mistake.  Why was that bad?  Well, it was just the starting of the drought.  But my dad had both, and he had to get rid of the horses, because we couldn   t  raise anything to feed them. He literally had to dispose of his horses for lack  of food. But it never rained on our place in 1934; it never even sprinkled.  I can   t remember that good.  13  Foreman  Hollowell  Kite  McCune  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Allen  Kite  Allen  Foreman  Well Mabry and I discuss it, because he lived twelve miles   my husband   to  the northwest, and he said,    We got a rain. We had the best crop, and a  hailstorm came along.    He said,    You smell like a silage pit.    But they set up  to Wheeless, which was three miles further than him, they didn   t get any rain,  but we never got a drop at Felt.  My dad farmed with horses, and some of the time he had to buy hay, that we  didn   t have enough feed to get them through the winter.  Do you remember a year without rain?  Oh yes.  I was interested that the farmers at the time actually knew what was going on,  because so much of the time you read about it now, it seems like they weren   t  aware that what they were doing was causing damage, and it sounds like here,  they knew what was going on, and they were trying to stop it from happening.  Stop it.  I   m surprised they didn   t take stronger measures at times.  What could they have taken?  I don   t know  laughing .  That was it, there was nothing. If somebody owns something, he can do what  he wants to with it, back then; now, the government would step in. But then, it  was his, and he could do what he wanted to.  I guess just beyond simply asking or just maybe telling him it might not be a  good idea or something.  About that time   s when the Haney Plow and some of those were invented or  built to rip up the land to help keep it from blowing.  Could you describe that plow and what it did to help stop the erosion?  Well, it had shovels, only they were just about this wide, and they had strips of  iron. I   m not very good at describing things, but anyway, there would be  several across. You had to pull it with a tractor. You could put it in the  ground, and it would kind of rip up the soil, but of course out our way, it was  sand clear down.  Yeah, and the thing is those things cost money, which we didn   t have. But  what my dad did, they called them pitters. They took a half disc and put on a  rod, one on here, and then the other one was the other side and staggered them,  and the net result was they dug a hole about this big that would catch any  water that came along and would also detour that sweeping wind a little bit,  14  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  McCune  Hollowell  McCune  Hollowell  McCune  Lemons  McCune  Lemons  Hollowell  McCune  Hollowell  Kite  and then when you had to farm it on a tractor without rubber tires, it broke  your back.  I   d say it broke a few other things too.  No, it didn   t seem to, but boy, I had to farm that pitted ground. Oh, I hated  those pitters  My dad says,    Well, they do conserve some moisture, I don   t  know what   s so bad,    but oh  You were just like this, all the time. You just  fell in and out, in and out, those wheels.  Well how do you think the sandstorms and dust storms maybe changed your  life a little bit when the drought came, the wind picked up, did you notice a  change in your lifestyle? Did your chores change at all maybe, or the things  you did each day, did the weather affect that at all?  I don   t think there   s much change. We just had to get by from day to day.  You just get used to it when it goes on for years.  And as a kid you don   t think much about it. Well I know one thing, I got to  thinking the other day, we had a garden then. We didn   t have a garden    til  times got hard. My folks were not gardeners, and we didn   t have a garden  after we didn   t have to have, but we lived off of this cream and chickens and  the garden and anything you could preserve.  What about the family garden, did you guys remember having one that you ate  from?  Yes.  Yeah, we did.  Us kids had to do lots of work in it too.  That was it.  Pull weeds and hoe.  Pull weeds in the garden, yeah we had to do that.  So many trees you had to hoe between before your dad got home.  What kind of things were you raising in your garden?  Tomatoes especially, and green beans, onions and lettuce, rhubarb. I hated it.  Yeah, there was a big, big long row of rhubarb.  Yeah.  You hated the rhubarb?  15  McCune  Kite  Foreman  McCune  Allen  McCune  Kite  Hollowell  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  Hollowell  Allen  Foreman  Kite  Hollowell  I hated the rhubarb when I was a kid, and I just love it now. I go to the store,  and it   s kind of expensive  laughter .  Do you remember sort of relying more on that garden as times got a little  harder?  Oh, you had to  If you wanted to eat, you had to.  Raised it and canned it.  My mother canned a lot. There was a big family of us. We had half-gallon  jars that she canned in. We had peach trees and tomatoes; we canned lots of  tomatoes.  We had peach trees, cherry trees, strawberries, and oh, lots of good stuff.  Do you think that family garden was a key to your survival out here, of making  it through the time period?  I think it had to have been. My dad raised hogs. We had our own meat, we  had chickens, and cream and milk and butter and stuff like that. We never  went hungry, I   m thankful for that.  The one thing they had here in Boise City was a mill, a flour mill. Really and  truly, at times, in our family, we literally lived on wheat and meat, because you  took your wheat to the mill, and you got flour, you got cracked wheat, which  was cereal, and I hate it to this day.  I thought that was pretty good  laughter .  Oh, I hate that stuff  It   s grainier than cream of wheat. It   s just cracked wheat.  Did you mix up your cornbread and milk, mix it up into a big mush?  Yes.  Well that was about an every evening meal.  My husband says that it was at their house. Stupid me, as I say, I was from  Kansas, I never ate cornbread until I was grown. I   d never even tasted it. We  didn   t know anything about cornmeal, literally. It was flour.  Do you remember the food or the things you ate getting better? Do you  remember when there was more food on the table or a better variety as the  times picked up? Do you remember a change in your lifestyle at all? Maybe  more treats coming in.  Well I   m sure it got better.  16  McCune  Kite  McCune  Kite  McCune  Hollowell  McCune  Kite  McCune  Hollowell  Kite  Hollowell  Kite  Hollowell  Kite  Allen  Kite  Yeah, we got more treats as times got better, I think, but our family always had  plenty to eat.  What was a good treat for you?  Usually candy for us kids. We lived quite a ways from town, and we didn   t  get to town too often to get candy, but I still like my candy.  Do you remember some favorite candy you had as a child?  Anything that   s chocolate and nuts. I still like it  laughing .  We lived between Elkhart, Kansas and Texhoma, Oklahoma; we were just  halfway between on the main road that went to these towns. So my dad, we  had to go in a wagon with horses, and we   d have to leave very early and get  back late to make it in one day, but every once in a while, especially for the  Fourth of July or any special occasion, my dad would take some quilts or some  old things along to wrap the ice and get like a hundred pounds of ice, and then  we   d make ice cream. That was a special time with us we always had ice  cream for the Fourth of July.  That was us too.  Is that the only time he would buy ice?  Just about.  We didn   t buy ice, only when we were going to make ice cream.  He   d go into town and buy a hundred pound block?  Uh-huh, and wrap it up real good so it wouldn   t melt until we got back home;  with newspapers and old quilts and things like that.  How long would it last?  Oh, we   d make the ice cream the next day.  Oh wow. Do you guys remember buying ice at all, or anything like that?  My grandpa Leak lived with us, my mother   s dad, and he had an old Model-T.  By this time, there was Felt, Felt was started in 1925, and someway or another,  there was ice. Anyway, he   d come home with a block of ice; not a hundred  pounds, but a block, but we   d have to get the cows in and milk them, and then  we made ice cream. We always had eggs. We had chickens, and we had milk.  We   d have ice cream, and that was a good treat.  That   s something we take for granted right now, to just go pick up some ice  17  McCune  Hollowell  Allen  Kite  McCune  Foreman  McCune  Kite  McCune  Kite  Hollowell  McCune  Hollowell  McCune  Kite  Hollowell  cream. I can   t imagine just having it once a year.  You have to turn the crank to make it, or milk the cows.  Yeah.  I got the old crank ice cream freezer out and my grandkids, a few years back,  cranked some ice cream, and they weren   t very impressed. I thought that they  ought to think about how we used to do it, but now there   s a lot of people that  use electric ice cream freezers.  Well, during that period of time, sometimes we talk about what people did for  entertainment, in the free time that they had, or what games you all would  play, or things you would do in your free time for fun is something we talk  about sometimes a little bit, besides make ice cream and eat it all  laughing .  My family read books a night.  That   s what I was going to say, we read.  We   d read at night. I did most of the reading to my husband. I just had two  children, but anyway, I would read books to them at night.  Read out loud?  Yes. We   d pass the time away that way a lot.  Is that something you remember or recall?  Yeah, we had books, and my mother always read to us. One thing that we did  a lot, we   d go to church at least three times a week. We   d go on Wednesday  night, Sunday morning, and Sunday night.  We did too.  Then in between times we   d have revivals, and we   d go every night when we  had those. I don   t know about games. We had marbles and a ball that we   d  play Annie Over. We   d throw it over our house, or the schoolhouse   we did  that a lot at school. We even played some baseball at school. We played  games like Black Man and Dare Base. Do you remember those?  Drop the handkerchief.  How do you play those games? How do you play Black Man?  Well, you   d have some people at one side up by the house and the others out  by the fence, and then there   d be one in the middle. We   d try to change sides,  and if this guy in the middle caught us, well then we were the Black Man.  18  Kite  Hollowell  Lemons  Hollowell  McCune  Foreman  Hollowell  Kite  Allen  Hollowell  Allen  Kite  Allen  Hollowell  Foreman  And what was the other one you mentioned?  Dare Base. We   d have a base that we   d try to touch with our foot, and then  we   d run back, and they   d try to chase us. We gave them a dare and they   d  chase us back. Sometimes they caught us too.  You mentioned drop the handkerchief.  Yeah, we did that.  You   ll have to tell them how we played it. I think I   ve forgot  laughing .  Ring Around the Rosie.  Well, we   d get in a circle, and one would go around and drop the handkerchief  behind you, behind the person, and then they were supposed to grab it up and  start after them, and he   d try to get back before he got caught.  I remember playing that one when I was little. What about you and your  entertainment?  Well, that   s what we did at school. By the 1930   s, I was in high school for  four years, and we sometimes had parties at people   s houses at night. Of  course, we played all of those games.  Play parties.  I can   t remember playing them in high school. We played basketball, and we  had school plays. I always stayed with a neighbor and rode a horse a mile at  night to practice play. We had to practice at night, because they wouldn   t let  us practice in school in the daytime. I wasn   t a reader. I didn   t read until I got  older  laughing ; now you can   t get me out of a book.  Do you remember some of the plays you put on, or what plays you were in?  I really can   t remember, but I just remember going at night with my friend.  No, I can   t remember the names.  There was one thing else they did in our part of the world. They called them  play parties, and it was kind of like square dancing, only we played outside,  and the guys would sing the songs instead of having music for it, and lots of  times they had one a week. I didn   t go to very many of them, but I went to a  few.  I did, but in our community, we had some musicians with banjos, violins, and  guitars. They sang with it some, but they had the other music. The fact of the  matter, most of them were World War I songs that Spud had brought back,  Spud McDaniel. She   s a McDaniel. He kind of ramroded the music for it.  19  Hollowell  Foreman  Allen  Foreman  Kite  Allen  Foreman  Lemons  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  McCune  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  One of the ones I remember the name of was    Skip To My Lou My Darling.     Yes, but they were square dances, but you didn   t dare use the word    dance   . It  was against the religion, so they were play parties. There wasn   t any  difference.  Well there were dances in my community, but I wasn   t allowed to go.  Well, I guess that   s part of it right there.  Right, you could go to a play party, but you couldn   t go to a dance.  Yes, right.  And the thing is your folks usually took you to those play parties, and the men  would sit and visit. Sometimes the women went along and got to visit, but it  was usually the older men who were there.  To kind of chaperone.  Exactly.  It was a good place to meet and talk to other people.  Uh-huh. In the summertime, we had them every two weeks. Well, we   d have  a party, and then somebody would volunteer, well you can have it at my house  in two weeks. That   s the only time I ever got in on ice cream and ice, because  somebody would manage to bring the ice, and everybody bought a container of  ice cream mix in their freezer, and the men sat there and ground, and then  somewhere along the line when they got it all done, you stopped and ate ice  cream, and if some of the women had brought a cake or cookies, why you got  that, and if they didn   t, you didn   t.  The mix usually consisted of milk and eggs and sugar.  Yeah, my mother didn   t have any extracts or spices. We couldn   t afford them.  You   d go some place, and somebody else would have lemon or vanilla.  We had vanilla. We always had vanilla.  We did not have any extracts at all.  That   s pretty plain ice cream.  It   s good if you   ve got sugar and milk and real heavy cream. And we didn   t  cheat on the cream, like some people made it out of milk.  Right, it was real ice cream.  20  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  McCune  Kite  McCune  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  It was cream.  We had those cream separators. You usually had what cream you wanted to  use.  Yeah, real thick cream.  Of course, we sold that. That   s how we helped to get our groceries was selling  the cream.  That was the only income at our house, but my mom would still dump in the  cream. We had cream and butter. Some people were a little scotch that did  have cows.  Were a lot of husbands met at these play parties?  Oh yeah. Oh, you mean our husbands, no.  Well I mean just in general.  I met mine in the first grade.  Did you know then that that   s who it was going to be?  No, the teacher   s along the way, when we did get married, said oh,    Well I   ve  known that since they were in the third grade.    I guess he knew it, but I didn   t,  from all I   ve heard.  It sounds like these play parties would have been a good chance for  perspective people to meet each other and talk and see what was going on and  everything.  Done a little courting probably. I wasn   t allowed to go to a play party, but I  sure got married.  And then it was too late  laughter    Yeah, too late.  Really and truly, that was the reason those fathers were there, I   m sure.  We   ve heard a few stories about men kind of making sure everybody was out in  the open, the fathers walking around and making sure everybody was  accounted for.  They did. There was no way around that. I had a friend that had moved away  in these dirty thirties, and she came back to visit. Well, she was where she  didn   t belong in my dad   s opinion. He called her folks,    You better come get  her,    and they did.  21  Kite  Lemons  McCune  Hollowell  McCune  Hollowell  McCune  Lemons  Hollowell  McCune  Foreman  Kite  Allen  Kite  Allen  Away she went.  You mentioned your friend moved away and came back. Did you know people  who left because of the dirty thirties?  I did. I left.  I did too. I left in June of    35 and came back in November of    36.  We didn   t leave    til    36.  See,    35 is the year of the Black Sunday.  And came back in the early 40   s.  Where did you go?  Arkansas.  Up close to Kansas City. That Missouri can be the hottest, driest place in the  whole world  laughter .  My husband and I, after this came up, were talking, and in    34, the  schoolrooms were literally not big enough to hold all the children. They put  them together, they had the seats just as close as they could get those desks.  Sometimes somebody sat with you because there was not enough. This was  when school was out in    34      33 and    34, there were lots of children. We  went back to school in    35. We had all the room in the world. He said,    I  don   t believe there were a fourth of the kids.    I   d say that at least half of them  disappeared that summer. Their folks moved.  Do you remember losing friends or neighbors or relatives and people moving  out?  I had a letter from some kids and scholars in Massachusetts a couple of years  ago. They   d read this book about the dust bowl, and they said,    How in the  world did you stand it?    and my answer to them was that we had no place to  go and no money to go. That was the trouble. We stayed where we were. My  folks finally lost the place and had to move. Daddy got work on the road to  help his move. I was already in college. I went, I don   t know, I guess when I  finished high school. There just wasn   t anything else maybe. Anyway, some  way or another, I wound up in college  laughing .  Where did you go?  To Goodwell. It cost me a  120 the first year I went to college. That took care  of my room and board. My clothes were chicken feed sacks, and mama dyed  some old pieces of material and made my good dress. I didn   t feel any  different.  22  Foreman  Hollowell  Allen  Foreman  Hollowell  Lemons  Hollowell  Kite  McCune  Kite  McCune  Kite  McCune  Foreman  Kite  We were all alike. No one else had anything either, so we didn   t know we  were deprived.  We didn   t know we were so poor at that time.  We had the chickens.  No, we didn   t know we were poor. I   m sure our folks went nuts trying to  figure out what they were going to do.  Talking about this dust storm, my dad, in    36, had dust pneumonia, and he was  really sick for a while, but he got over it and lived to be an old man.  What did you do to try to make someone comfortable if there   s dust blowing  around and they have dust pneumonia; what can you do?  That was the year I was in Arkansas, and I didn   t have the money even down  there to come back and see about him, but my step-mother was taking care of  him, so he pulled through.  And you headed out too, you left.  Yes, we left in    35, and we were gone five years. The only reason we were  gone five years, we couldn   t get enough money to get back. We lived up close  to Kansas City. We didn   t like it there at all.  Did you sell your land here?  Me and my husband didn   t own land. My dad did, but me and my husband  didn   t own any land.  You went there to escape here.  To get out, yeah. Our son was small then, and he was having dust pneumonia  every year, and the doctor told us we were going to have to get him out of the  dust, so we had relatives that lived close to Kansas City. We didn   t know any  place else to go, so we went up there. We didn   t know it was going to be so  hot and dry when we went up there, but it was hot and dry.  I   m a living case of this dust pneumonia. I   ll let you read it. I can   t pronounce  it, but it turns out to be Black Lung. That   s what Mayo Clinic   that   s the  reason I   m kind of incapacitated. My lungs are, the ex-rays show all these  spots all over that is dust that went in, and your body will put a membrane  around those extra things that aren   t supposed to be there, and they become  scar tissue. Anyway, when they finally took me to the doctor, he says; this  great long name that I put out there for you.  Pneumoconiosis or something.  23  Foreman  McCune  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  McCune  Kite  McCune  Foreman  McCune  Kite  Foreman  Allen  It   s a type of pneumonia I guess, if you go back on it, but he says,    Black  Lung.    I said,    I   ve never been near a coal mine.    He says that   s the same  thing, and that to this day, the people who work in these elevators where  there   s so much dust, he says,    They all get the same thing.    He says,    If it   s a  miner, it   s Black Lung; if it   s an elevator operator, it   s got something else, but  it   s all this same disease.     Dust pneumonia probably.  Well, you just think of all the people that died in the thirties, and they just kept  on dying because they had had all this dust in their lungs. They tell me, once  it   s in there, you don   t get it out.  My husband   s uncle died with dust pneumonia. He lived down by Texhoma,  but they had him in western Kansas at Bennington. They took him back up  there, but he didn   t last very many days after they took him back up there. He  died with that dust pneumonia, so a lot of people died from it.  And the children especially. Maybe the preschoolers. I remember in    35 we  happened to be gone for five weeks, because we got stranded and came back,  there were three little folks had died in that five weeks.  If you were a child and you got it, it was bad.  You kept it.  You said your son had it.  Yeah, he had dust pneumonia. He doesn   t have any lung problems. He   s  grown now; he   ll be 70 years old in a few days, and he doesn   t have a bit of  lung problems.  Well maybe he was young enough. Well, you got him out of there.  Yeah, we got him out of here.  But that   s been my problem all along was dust as a child, I guess.  My son will be 70 years old the 18th, whenever the 18th is, a day or two.  So you think if you would have had the means, it sounds like all of you, and  some of you did it, but if you had the money and the means, you would have  left.  If you could have figured out where you could go. That was my folks.  Whenever I read The Grapes of Wrath, I think it   s terrible. Have you ever  read that book?  24  Kite  Hollowell  Allen  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Hollowell  McCune  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Hollowell  McCune  Allen  Kite  Oh yeah.  That   s the people that went to California, wasn   t it?  There was a lot of people that thought California would be the answer to every  problem. Of course, that was just one story.  Yeah, and it was magnified to some extent. But now again, part of ours was  my folks homesteaded in Montana, and then they hit a five-years drought, and  they had to leave Montana, because there was absolutely nothing. Now this  was back in 1919. Well, you might say, they had no place to really set down  and settle until they came out here in 1930. It was a bad deal too; it was  another drought.  Yeah, they went from one to the other.  They   d been through one, and then went through another one. I guess you   d  say they thought, why move, it   ll go with us  laughter    Over in our country, in 1925, it was a real dry year, and then in 1926 they  raised good wheat crops. Do you remember that Bonnie?  No, not too good, no.  My dad and the neighbors around us did.  That was what caused them to break out a lot of land, this    26,    27, and    28,  they could rise good wheat, and they just wrecked the place.  Do you ever hear any Woody Guthrie songs, Woody Guthrie singing about  dust pneumonia?  No.  There   s a lot of songs written about the dust pneumonia and going to  California and stuff during the dust bowl period. Well, let   s see, we talked a  little bit about working on the roads, getting work on the roads, and that was  probably with the government programs, WPA.  WPA. Yeah, my dad worked on that.  My husband did too.  The WPA might have paid some, but it was just a county deal. The county  commissioner is the one that hired him to work a while.  I was just wondering if you remembered any about the Roosevelt and the     New Deal    and the WPA coming through and the government programs.  25  Allen  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Hollowell  McCune  Kite  McCune  Kite  Hollowell  Kite  Hollowell  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  I don   t remember a lot about it.  I remember my dad wouldn   t have anything to do with it. He didn   t want the  government telling him what to do, so he would not participate in the farm  programs or anything like that, which proved to be a detriment. What I mean,  he was just hard headed.  Right, or independent.  He wasn   t going to have them telling him what to do, so we didn   t have those  things that some others did from WPA and so forth.  Do you remember the government programs?  I remember hearing about it, but I really didn   t know much about it. We just  hoped it   d help, the    New Deal    would be something that would help us.  My husband worked on the road some for the WPA, I remember that.  Bringing in some extra...  Bringing in a little extra cash besides milking the cows and the chickens and  the hogs.  Do you remember they had programs where you would sell some livestock or  put some livestock down or leave land fallow for a year or so?  That   s when they killed some of the cattle. Yeah, I remember that.  What was your take on that, or your father   s attitude?  Well he hated to see them do it, but I think they did kill some of ours.  Now your dad probably said,    No way.     Well, they killed them right next to our place. There was a gully. It was the  stupid way that they did it. They just milled those cattle and shot into the herd  instead of shooting them in the head or something, and it just made all the  farmers and ranchers around there sick at their stomach, but it was right next to  our place where they were killing the ones out there at Felt.  That might have had something to do with his attitude.  I   m sure it did. In fact, there was someone, the man in charge was from  Kentucky or Virginia, I don   t know where, but he had the same last name, and  he said,    You know, I think we   re cousins,    to my dad. My dad came home  and said,    I think so too, but I   m not going to admit it,    and he wouldn   t even  talk to the man  laughter . So now then I turn into genealogy see, my  26  Kite  Allen  Kite  McCune  Allen  Foreman  Allen  McCune  Foreman  Allen  Kite  Hollowell  grandfather came over from England in1870, and on the same ship, he had a  brother that came at the same time, and he went south into Virginia or  somewhere in there, where my grandfather went into Ohio. My dad was  firmly convinced the man was his cousin, but no sir. And so I never did have  any contact, when I   d have liked to know what happened to that great uncle  and his family. So that   s how vehement he was. He wouldn   t even talk to the  man, because he  the man  wanted to talk.  Do you remember local attitudes toward the government?  I think daddy had sold or gotten rid of most of our cattle, we might have had a  little, but I can   t remember too much of that happening. I knew about it, but I  can   t remember.  Any    New Deal    attitudes? Do you remember how your neighbors or friends  felt about the government?  I just remember the words. It didn   t mean anything to me.  I tell you, in New Mexico, I   m just two miles from the New Mexico line, of  course a little farther from Clayton, but they built a schoolhouse. I felt like it  was a good thing. The Cynica Schoolhouse was built by the WPA.  And they   re still using the one at Clayton.  And a lot of the furniture in the Clayton school. There was a lot of work in  New Mexico by the WPA.  Well, the WPA did lots of roadwork down in our country. I think my husband  worked on it some.  You go over there now, and where these canyons are, where you need to go up  around a hill, we   re talking about New Mexico, those bridges that were WPA  work are still there and in great shape. For one thing, a lot of that was  Mexicans. I don   t mean from Mexico, I mean they had come in there 300  years before, and they were good stone masons, wonderful stone masons, and  they   d build these culverts of hand laid stone, and they   re still there in very  good shape, but as you say, that was WPA work. That was just over the line  from us.  There was some WPA work in Texhoma, whenever I got over there, and it was  on road like she said. I think Bill worked on the road. He had to drive eight  miles with his team     Well roadwork seems to be really important around here.  My dad worked on the highways, 95 that goes into Texhoma now from this  road that goes to Guymon. That   s where they worked with the WPA.  27  Kite  Foreman  Allen  Kite  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Hollowell  So do you remember roads improving? From what to what?  Cow trails, two ruts.  Just trails. Of course a lot that were trails, however when the sand blew off the  field, why it   d fill up those trials, and then you   d have to have your shovel to  get out. After the graded roads, then they kind of caused a little bit of trouble  with dirt, still do a little bit.  Maybe road improvement was something good that came out of all this.  Oh yes. What we call Old 64, it didn   t exist before that.  I think in    37 and    38, they were building it down our way.  No, the roads were a complete change, because, no joke, a lot of our roads  were two ruts before that.  I remember I came through here in    87, and I bought a little book called One  Stoplight.  Not a Stoplight In the County.  That   s it, Not a Stoplight In the County.  Norma Jean Young.  There   s probably still one up there.  Yeah, I   ll bet there   s one up there.  And it talked about how in the whole entire county there wasn   t one stoplight.  Uh-huh, still doesn   t have.  I was thinking of that yesterday, there   s still not. That   s funny. Well  something that always seems to bring up memories or somebody has stories  about is when times got hard and work was scarce, there seemed to be an  influx of hobos or tramps or kind of wanderers coming through the area, and  attitudes towards those people varied a lot.  Some called them gypsies.  Yeah, carloads of gypsies coming into town.  Well I remember a covered wagon with gypsies going by our place. I don   t  remember much that they did. They stopped and wanted some water. I don   t  know, maybe they wanted some chickens, I don   t hardly remember that one  time, but we did have people that walked, usually just one man at a time. Like  I told you a while ago, it was twenty miles each way to a town, so my dad  28  Kite  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  McCune  Hollowell  McCune  Hollowell  Kite  Foreman  Allen  McCune  Foreman  Allen  would always feed them if they were hungry. If it was late at night, he   d  usually let them stay all night too.  Would they do a little work, or would he not ask them to do some work for  their food?  No, I don   t think so.  Our experience was the same. It was usually men walking, trying to get  somewhere to get work. You fed them, and if it was night, they slept, in the  barn probably. It depended on who they were. Sometimes they got to sleep on  the kitchen floor, but not always, and they went on the next day, because we  had no work for them; we had no money.  Do you have any hobo stories coming to your house?  Well, just at the moment, I can   t think of any, but I   m sure we did. Of course,  we were a long way from town, and quite a ways from a main road, and they  didn   t get that far very much, off of the main road.  Since we were on that main road     Yeah, you got lots of them.  We had more.  It seemed like the closer you lived to railroad tracks the more company you  got.  That and a highway. A lot of them didn   t ride the rails, they walked. Whether  they were afraid of getting killed   I mean there were lots of accidents jumping  on and off those trains. I don   t really know, but an awful lot of them just flat  walked the highway. They were looking for work. They weren   t bums. They  wanted a job. They had a family back home that was hungry.  Well I can remember one particular time, it was after there were vehicles, it  was probably a Model-A car that they were driving, and they stopped down the  road from our place and sent two children back to ask for food, so mama fixed  up, I know one thing was a bucket of lard. We always had gallon buckets of  lard. I don   t know what all, but she fixed up some things and sent them. I  don   t know what kind of people they were.  What could somebody like that do with a bucket of lard?  They probably had a skillet they begged from somebody else, because when  they send two children back, you know they   re panhandlers pretty well.  That   s what we kind of thought, but we didn   t have all that many people come  along and ask for something, but she always sent something. But we probably  29  Kite  Allen  McCune  Kite  Foreman  McCune  Allen  Foreman  Allen  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  McCune  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  didn   t have a lot of different things ourselves but a bucket of lard. We  generally had lard.  I guess they could fry up something. They could use it to fry up stuff.  Well it was kind of a necessity back in those days.  We had lots of fried potatoes and beans at our house.  Well, with the dust storms coming and the sand blowing, and even the  occasional big duster, there seems to be a lot of shoveling going on inside the  house as well as outside  laughing .  Yes, with scoops.  You didn   t have a vacuum to clean up the dust either. You   d sweep and sweep  and sweep, and then you   d get the mop bucket and mop    til you got it all.  Then you   d have another dust storm cleaning up the dust  laughter .  Yes.  The only way we protected ourselves was with a wet cloth over our face when  the dirt was so bad.  What amazed me, because I was a child myself, but they   d have a baby on the  bed with a wet washrag across its face, and it would leave it there. Then  there   d be these two little dirty spots where the nostrils were. As a child  myself, I just couldn   t picture those babies leaving those on there.  It doesn   t look like they would.  But they did, at least that one did. Here were these two little brown spots. I  suppose the child, as I remember it, was less than five months old, and it didn   t  do this. But we slept with them. You just went to bed with a wet cloth over  your face when the dust was blowing.  If you knew a storm was coming in, what would you do?  Get the wet sheets over the windows.  Hurry up and get the chickens in the chicken house if you could, so they  wouldn   t blow away.  And if you had left anything outside, like your washtub or bucket, you   d be  sure to get them in.  If the washing was on the line, you grabbed it, you really grabbed it, and you  hoped to maybe turn the windmill off. Sometimes the static electricity kept  30  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Allen  Kite  Foreman  McCune  Foreman  Kite  Hollowell  Kite  Foreman  Allen  Kite  you from doing that. We had a wind charger. The only way we turned it off,  we had a snap on the turn off and a bucket of rocks. You ran and grabbed that  bucket of rocks and put it on that wind charger as quickly as you could.  Would it blow out the batteries, or what would happen?  You were always afraid it would just literally take the propeller off. We didn   t  know, but that was the first thing you got.  Any dust storm preparations you recall?  No, I wasn   t home when those big rolling storms came. There were probably  some, but not like the great big ones. This says something about animals. I  don   t think we noticed anything like that, but I just don   t think there was any  particular preparation. I know some stories about people being lost in those  dust storms. You just kind of took it, but I don   t really know about my parents  and that one in    35. I was at Goodwell in school. I remember seeing it rolling  up and coming.  Getting lost seems like it would have been a real possibility.  It was.  Yeah, there was a boy lost in that dust storm that was riding his horse. The  horse came in the next morning   it was between here and Guymon  somewhere, I   ve forgotten. The next morning, the horse was there, but the boy  wasn   t, and somehow or other the boy got throwed or something, and killed  him, but the horse came back and they found the boy.  In a way, if you knew it, and it was these that lasted two or three days, they   d  stretch a rope; you didn   t dare use wire, that stuff bit back. It was like the  snowstorms that were so bad back then, to get from the house to the barn, you  needed a guide. We didn   t have to use one, but I know some of the neighbors  did.  Do you remember tying ropes to get around?  My dad used to rope in the snowstorm. They had a big snowstorm when we  first came to Oklahoma, and that   s the only time that I remember that he used a  rope to get back from the barn or to the house.  I see that famous picture of that guy with his two kids running to the house.  Our neighbors.  I lived right across; that was the section that was broken up. I lived right  across to the north of that picture.  And those were your neighbors too?  31  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Allen  Foreman  McCune  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Allen  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Hollowell  Yes.  That was the section that your dad told that guy not to break up, and that  picture proves the point. Wow, that   s pretty amazing. Well, do you think that  time period affected you in any way? Are there traits or memories that you  carry with you to this day?  Frugality.  Conservative, that   s what I think.  Uh-huh  Never waste food.  I save everything.  My family gripes because I keep it. Somebody might need it, whether it was a  piece of string or an old coat, you just don   t throw things away. Somebody  might need them.  Do you have a hard time with grandkids, trying to explain to them why you feel  that way?  They think you   re nuts  laughter    My daughter, I   ve got one that   s kind of like me, and I   ve got another one that  throws everything in the book away, and when she comes into my house, why  out goes a lot of things  laughing , but most of the things she throws away  don   t amount to a hill of beans anyway. But I am really conservative, I think,  as a result. I don   t know if it   s as a result. It might be just born in me. But  you know, there   s a lot of people that go out and start their car and let it run for  ages to not get in a cold car, and shoot, I just go out and get in the car. I don   t  see any use in using that gasoline.  We even did that before gasoline got so high, didn   t we?  Oh yes, it   s just a part of life. You saved every penny you could.  Were there any community assistance efforts or community drives to gather  food or money or clothes for people during that time? Like if you knew a  family was pretty bad, would you work together to help out somebody you  knew needed it?  I didn   t know if it was community. If you knew that someone had some  children that your children   s clothes they could wear, you gave them to them,  and you didn   t insult them; they were delighted.  No, I remember I got some that I was glad to wear.  32  Foreman  Hollowell  Allen  Foreman  Allen  Hollowell  Lemons  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Allen  Hollowell  Foreman  Allen  Foreman  My clothes were nearly all made out of older people   s clothes that an aunt sent  from California.  And like she mentioned, the feed sacks. A lot of our dresses were made from  feed sacks.  It was amazing that we had all those chickens, and the place where the folks  bought chicken feed, they   d get chicken feed sacks with all different kinds of  prints, and they   d let you go in and pick them out. You know, if it took two  sacks to make something or sometimes if you wanted a quilt, why you   d get  five sacks just alike.  You bought your chicken feed by what the print was, because you were going  to use that a lot of ways.  They were pretty sacks.  Yeah they were.  Did you have a favorite pattern from one of those sacks?  You had to make them match when you bought them, because it wouldn   t be  there the next time. Hundred pound sacks, I felt sorry for the people selling  the stuff, because every woman wanted the one that was on the bottom. And  you know, they   d be mixed through. There   d be these heaps of sacks. Well, I  want four alike is what we always bought. You wanted four that were just  alike. Oh, just think how those men had to move those hundred pound sacks.  Those weigh a little.  Yeah, a hundred pounds.  A hundred pounds, but they got heavier with time.  Yeah, we   ve got a lot of feed sack stories going through.  I wore them to college, and I never did ever feel bad wearing feed sacks.  Maybe I didn   t have enough gumption, but everybody else dressed just about  the same.  Well, somebody that could sew good, they looked pretty when they got  through with them.  They were nice cloth. In fact, I think I could go upstairs and find sunbonnets  made out of them yet.  I   ve still got some that I was going to make.  And those sacks right up there, we used them too, because that   s where we got  our wheat ground. You got your flour.  33  Allen  Kite  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  Hollowell  Kite  Hollowell  Foreman  Yeah, and corn.  So wearing the feed sack dresses and maybe only having a pair of shoes didn   t  bother you; you didn   t feel inferior at all.  No, you were better off than the other fellow was, because their folks had  enough feed sacks. Some people didn   t have all those feed sacks.  You mentioned bringing clothes or items to families that might need it, or  receiving those items. Were you careful to make it not appear like you were  feeling sorry for them? You said didn   t insult them.  I don   t think so. They were just delighted to get them, don   t you think?  Yeah.  It wasn   t discriminating.  Where I remember that I got most of mine, I had a cousin that was just a little  bit older than I was, and her mother sent boxes of like coats. I know one time  there was a coat, and I was just really glad to get that coat. But they usually  would fit me all right. But I don   t remember getting any from any of our  neighbors or anything like that.  Well, kind of as a closing question, we always ask if you can think back to that  time, what to you most typifies that time period, what memory you might have,  or recollection, most describes that period for you, or what   s the most vivid  memory you have of that period? It could just be a small incidence or an  occurrence or something that happened to you or something you had that  brings back that period for you.  Well, when I think about the dust bowl, I was caught out in that    35 Black  Sunday, and I always think of that when we think of how bad it was, how that  just rolled in from the north, and you couldn   t have any idea of what was  behind it or what was going to happen. I was with some people that were  going back to Texhoma that day, and he started, thought maybe he could get  far enough to outrun it, but he didn   t get very many miles    til it caught him,  and we had to stop. It was just black; you couldn   t even see your hand like  that. We had to stop for a while. It cleared up in a little bit, enough that you  could drive, but the house that we pulled in at, the people weren   t home. It  cleared up enough, we got on over to my dad   s, and they weren   t home. See,  people got caught away from home in it, but that   s one of the memories I have  of that Black Sunday.  Bringing up that Black Sunday, my folks and I were in a car this side of  Buffalo, over there close to Knowles when it rolled in. It was just so still.  You could see this coming, but there was no wind; the birds, there were just  thousands of them coming, just coming and coming and coming. When it hit,  34  Hollowell  Foreman  Hollowell  Foreman  Kite  Allen  Foreman  Allen  Foreman  Allen  Kite  McCune  Kite  they were still hitting the car, just like hailstones. Now my husband says   he  was out here in the western part of this county   and he said they didn   t have  the birds. But apparently you did.  Yeah, we had some, maybe not as many. I don   t remember them hitting the  car.  Oh, they did. They were just like big hailstones. I would have always liked to  see the ground, how many of them it killed, but of course I didn   t. When you  could get some light, you went on.  Did you have to stop?  Oh yes, we stopped. At that time, there was a wagon, they were fleeing the  country with a family, either headed for eastern Oklahoma or Arkansas, and  the family was in the wagon ahead, and the little boy   probably ten or  eleven   was following with a couple of cows. You had to keep the cows  following the wagon. Here this was rolling in, and my dad said to the child,     You   ve got to get in the car with us.       No, I   ve got to stay with these cows.     Well, my dad got him in the car, and how long we sat there, I don   t know, but  it was a long while, and as you said, you couldn   t see your hand in front of  your face. When we started on, lights came on behind us. Why, we didn   t  have lots of rear end collisions, it just happened we were the lead car, and you  could see these lights behind. When we started, they all came along and  followed in everybody   s bumper. But that was somewhere around Knowles.  It was west of Buffalo; Buffalo was the first town we came to. But the birds  were what I remembered. They were just thick.  Your turn.  Well you know, I don   t know that I have any particular thing, but since this  has come up so much, this dust bowl business, I think back, and everyone was  in the same boat. There was no    well I   m uppity    or anything. Everyone was  in the same boat, and you didn   t think about somebody being better or looking  better. Or maybe it was just me, but I just went with what I had.  There just wasn   t any discrimination.  Yeah, there wasn   t.  As she said, everybody was in the same boat.  I of course didn   t realize it at the time, but whenever I think back now, it was  just that way.  Do you have a particular memory?  I was just sitting here thinking. I guess my memory   s not very good.  Well I know, we kind of wrapped this up neatly, but I want to go back again to  35  McCune  Kite  McCune  Hollowell  McCune  Kite  Allen  Foreman  Kite  McCune  Foreman  McCune  Allen  Hollowell  McCune  Foreman  Kite  Lemons  the questions again real quick, and I wanted to talk about the rabbit drives.  We had some people talking about the rabbit drives, like it was exciting.  It wasn   t to me. We went to the rabbit drive, my husband and I did. It was  over on a ranch land west of our place, down in the Griggs community. We  went to that rabbit drive, but I didn   t enjoy it a bit, beating those rabbits to  death with clubs. I didn   t like it at all.  You were involved in the whole process.  Uh-huh, yes. I helped bring them in, but when I saw what they were doing to  them I couldn   t. Of course, we need to get rid of the rabbits, I guess.  That was it.  Yes, they were so thick. But I couldn   t bear beating them to death with clubs,  and that   s what they did.  Any recollection of that with you three?  I think there was one. I read about it. There were some that planned to come,  from even down state, and weather or something, they didn   t get to come, and  they were really disappointed. Some people just go for things like that.  And then some of them, you felt like it was a necessity. You had to eradicate  those rabbits, or they were going to eradicate you, because they ate your crop.  Well, I   d forgotten that earlier. I think that   s just about it, unless there   s  anything else you want to add.  I never did go but to one rabbit drive.  That cured you.  That cured me.  Well I don   t know that there was an awful lot of them, but maybe there was. I  knew that there were some.  There were a lot of those jackrabbits. I didn   t go to a drive, I just heard about  them, but I never did have first hand experience.  Well I went to the drive, but I didn   t enjoy it at all.  Yeah, I was there, but I didn   t enjoy it.  Well I want to thank you all for coming here so early.  Yeah, thanks for taking the time to talk with us.  36  McCune  Lemons  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Foreman  Allen  Foreman  Kite  Foreman  Allen  Foreman  I enjoyed it.  Well, I think it   s a fun thing for us to do, and I hope that the people who  participate think it   s fun too.  If you want to keep these questions to look over them, or if you remember  something you want to add to it, another memory you have or anything, we   d  really appreciate it if you would call Ms. Randolph or Ms. Young, and they  can get in touch with us. We   ll call you, and we can talk some more if that   s  all right. These archives that we   re creating with your stories, I think, are  really important to the history of this state and of the region and of the time.  This will be on a permanent record.  Well, we did the tapes today, and you   ll each get a copy of the typed transcript  of our conversation today, but then the cassette tape copy and another written  copy will be at OSU in the library. Phyllis Randolph will have a copy of the  transcript here too.  Yeah, so you know through your help, we   re compiling a data base, a  collection of memories and accounts and everything else that I think will be  really useful in the years and decades and centuries to come.  One thing, we keep going back to this    35 dirt storm, there was one that must  have been in    37 that was almost the same out there at Felt. It was at a noon  hour, and some of us were going to walk to town. It was not much of a town,  but it was something to do, and we saw this dirt storm coming, so we headed  back. I don   t know if you   ve seen these chairs that the desk on the side? I was  sitting in one of those in the study hall. Of course, all one side was windows,  and another girl was sitting with her on that desk. I had my arm around her  waist. I couldn   t see her. But she graduated in    38 is the reason I   m putting it  in    37, because I didn   t go into high school.  I think there was one in    37.  Well, Agnes was sitting on that desk. I didn   t go into high school    til    37, and  she went out in    38, so it boils down to about    37. This was inside the study  hall.  Wow, that   s a pretty good memory.  And I had my arm around her waist, and I couldn   t see her. It was that much  dirt in that enclosed room.  It   s just a mist, like a fog.  Yeah.  37  Kite All right, well I thank you again.  -------  -------
