 Lemons  Kind of early in the afternoon we saw what looked like a cloud coming up, but  oh, it was so dark and so ominous looking and we didn   t know whether to start  out to go back to our districts or not. Finally the thing reached us and we were  living 15 miles or a little more west of Woodward here and it was dark, it  wasn   t like night but kind of like after sundown. The chickens thought it was  time to go to the chicken house and they were all going in getting up on the  roost you know. And we finally decided that it would be all right so we went  on. I don   t know just when that was but that was the first storm that we had.  Where were you?  Out at home. About 15 miles west of town here is where I grew up. Well I was  in the 5th grade when we moved out there. But still, I remember more of those  years than I remember the years when I was born and a little up to that time.  We lived south of Woodward where I was born. We went on to school, to our  districts that evening. I don   t know whether it was the year I taught down at  Sharon or whether it was the year I taught out at Keenan, I just don   t  remember. But I know it was the first one. It was somewhere along about    30,  well it would have to be I guess    29 and    30, somewhere along there. But now  the rest of the dustbowl experience I can   t remember that it was any different  than just any other time, only it was dirtier  (Laughter)  We   re in Woodward, Oklahoma. Today is May the 23rd of 2001, it   s about  12:30 in the afternoon and I   ll ask you to state your name--your full name,  maiden name, married name, all of that--and when you were born and where  you were born.  My name is Lola Dessie Herd Lehman.  And when were you born?  I was born June the 5th, 1909, about ten miles south of Woodward. My father  had homesteaded this farm down there, and so I was born on the homestead.  We lived there until I was in the 5th grade and then we moved out to Tangier,  and I finished school there through high school. We had a high school there at  that time. That was the main reason we moved from south of Woodward to  west of Woodward is so that we would be in a district that had a high school.  How many people went to your high school? How many people were in your  5  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lemons  Lehman  class?  I believe there were about 27 or 28 students in high school and in my  graduating class there were four girls, no boys. (Laughter)  An all girl class.  An all girl class, but some of the classes, some of the early classes there was  only one student to graduate or two students to graduate, and I expect seven or  eight students to graduate at one time was the most that ever graduated at one  time out there.  So four was still a pretty big class, though.  Yes, four was a pretty good size class. (Laughter)  One of the things we start with when we do this is to describe the house where  you grew up. What was it like, how many rooms did it have?  Well, when we lived in south of Woodward my father built us a house. It had  four rooms and an upstairs. When we moved west, to the farm that was west of  Woodward, the house wasn   t very big. There was a kitchen dining room and a  living room and two very small bedrooms. We lived in that small house for  about five years, or maybe more, maybe another year or two, I can   t just  remember. I believe I was 17 years old when Papa built onto this house and  built us a nice big living room and two bedrooms and bathroom, and got it  made into a more livable house. And what else did you want to know?  How many people were living in this house?  Five. Papa and Mama and me and my two sisters.  And you just had two sisters?  I just have two sisters, no brothers.  What were your sisters    names?  Lottie and Leone.  And where did you fit in that?  I was the oldest one.  The oldest one, okay.  Were you guys close in age?  Oh, yes. We were close, there   s less than four years difference in my age and  Leone   s age. By the way Leone spells here name, L-E-O-N-E, and not and A.  6  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Leone. What else you want to know? (Laughs)  So would you consider the house to be in a rural area?  Oh yes   Okay, so your Dad, was he a farmer?  Yes.  What did your mom do?  She was a stay-at-home mom. She just took care of the home and managed it.  Which is probably a job and a half, or more  (Laughs)  Yes.  Well, you would think with three girls that she would have plenty of help, but  since we didn   t have any brothers, I had to be the boy. So I was the one that  went with Papa to the field to work, whatever it was that we were doing. I  could handle a team of four horses hitched to a disk or larger pieces of  equipment. Everything was done with horses, we didn   t have tractors then. So  I   d either be on a knife sled or a disk or something else while Papa would be  maybe planting or doing some other work in the field. And we always had a  big garden, and so in between times we had to go and weed the garden. That  was a job none of us liked to do I guess but we did it anyway. (Laughs)  Did you like driving a team of horses? Was that fun or did you think,    Oh  man, I have to go out there again?     No, I didn   t mind doing that, but then I   m a person that doesn   t mind working.  I don   t mind doing things, and even now I still work part time. My part time  work now isn   t very hard to do. I sit here in my rocking chair and I crochet  lace or I crochet an afghan or I work on a quilt or I do things like that for  people.  Keep yourself busy don   t you? (Laughs)  I keep myself busy and keep my hands busy and keep my mind off of how I  feel   I want to ask you a couple more questions about your dad. Did you raise  mostly crops or cattle or both?  Both, but mostly more like a dairy farm. And then we raised feed crops for the  cattle and horses; I don   t know, we didn   t have a whole lot. We were not a  very wealthy family at all. But how we managed to get through school I   ll  never know, but we did. All three of us have degrees, and Lottie and I got our  master   s  degrees . But Leone decided by the time   well Leone was the one  7  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  that married, and I didn   t marry till I was past 30. And Lottie was about that  age when she married and she and I didn   t neither one have any children. Now,  Leone has three children, and she had about 60 hours of college work when  she married. She decided that she wasn   t ever going to do anything that  required any more education, so she was just a stay-at-home mom and took  care of her kids and helped. They were big wheat farmers, but their cattle  production was beef. Then she decided when the little boy, the youngest one of  her family, was six years old, she   d go back to teaching. So then she had to go  back to college and finish up her work. We   d go to school a while and then  we   d stop and teach a year or two and then go back to school, and it took me  six years to get a degree.  That was pretty common at that time, wasn   t it?  There were lots of students that had to stop and work or that had jobs there in  Stillwater or something. A whole lot of them just went straight through, but the  point was that a whole lot of people who should have got to go to college  couldn   t go, and didn   t go. They just didn   t have money enough to go, and  maybe they didn   t want an education bad enough to work and go to school,  and work and go to school.  You went to Oklahoma State, right?  Yes.  What year did you go there?  Well, when I got out of high school, you know back in those days we couldn   t  go very far from home. I had never been very far. I was a 4-H club member,  and so I got to go to Stillwater two or three summers to 4-H camp or whatever  they called it. I went to Oklahoma City two of three times to the state fair, and  I won a trip to Chicago to the 4-H National     Something like their convention?  Yes, we didn   t call it a convention, I can   t just think of the word right now.  But it was an annual affair, and it was kind of the crowning activity for 4-H  members. So, when I got out of high school, Mama didn   t want me to go very  far from home. So I went up to Alva one year up there, my freshman year. The  last year I was in 4-H I won a  150 scholarship. That was a lot of money. Lots  of scholarships are  2500 and  5000 now. The scholarships from our funds is  only, I think it   s supposed to be  600, but I   m not right sure, it   s been  500 for  quite a while. But I told them last year that we could raise it. After interest  went down (Laughter) I thought,    Well maybe we shouldn   t have done that.     But still, this year I think approximately 18 scholarships were given, whether  they were  500 or  600 I don   t know.  Wow, that   s wonderful. That must make you feel really good.  Oh, I do. And the letters I get from the kids are just wonderful. Some of them,  8  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  they always write me a thank you letter for the scholarship. Some of them  don   t say very much, they just thank me for the scholarship funds and that they  appreciate what I   ve provided and so on. Then some of them will tell me  something about their situation. One girl wrote and told me that her mother  and her brother, I believe it was, were in school at the same time she was, and  how much the scholarship helped, and I think at that time it might not have  been but  300. And one girl wrote and said that she had had to drop out of  school and work a year and with the scholarship she was going to be able to  get her degree.  Wow, that   s great.  I got two real good letters this year from a couple of the girls that got  scholarships, but that   s just real interesting and I appreciate the girls, and a few  boys also because now we   re kind of spread out in the College of Education  and Human Environmental Sciences. Then we have a general scholarship that  includes pre-med and agriculture, College of Agriculture, and the College of  Business Administration. So there are some young men who get scholarships  along in there.  How did you use your scholarship when you went to school?  Well, I just used it to pay. We didn   t have to pay  75 an hour whatever  they   re paying now. We had a few little laboratory fees like  2.50 for a foods  laboratory, and maybe  2 or  3 for chemistry, I can   t just remember, but that  was about it. Then our books didn   t cost a whole lot,  3,  4,  5 a book. Now I  understand they begin at about  75 and go up.  Some of them are incredibly expensive.  That   s one thing I want to talk to you about.  Okay.  After a while.  So did that  150 cover your first year?  Almost. Lottie was ready to go to college her first year that year. So I had the   150 to start, and Papa and Mama had had a real good year and this was in  1928 before the banks all closed and everything. I think that probably they  sent us about  250   that made us  500. We had a little efficiency apartment  where we did our own meals and again, we took some food from home and we  just got through in real good shape. The next year then we dropped out and  taught school two years and by that time Leone was ready to go to college. So  that was the year that all three of us were there.  Wow, and all three of you were in Stillwater then?  Yes. My degree is from Stillwater and Lottie, both of her degrees are from  9  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lemons  Lehman  Stillwater. My master   s is from the University of Arkansas, and Leone then  had about, as I said, about 60 hours at Stillwater, but then she finished her  degree up at Alva.  When you went to teach for two years, where did you teach?  Oh, you   ll never believe it  Woodward County goes down quite a ways south  of here and comes across, and I was right in the southwest corner of the  county, that school district that   s right down there. Back then it was pretty  well back in the boondocks, as they call it.  Lottie had the next district east of mine. She was right on the south county  line and I was on the west county line and south, right in the corner down  there. Lottie taught her two years at the same school, but I moved the second  year to another school. Really, I had an average daily attendance of four  students that year and I don   t remember what they did. It seems to me that they  decided to pay tuition and send to few children to a neighboring district.  Anyway, I moved back up this way a little ways and I taught at, I don   t  remember, I always referred to it as Keenan, there was a post office there at  that time; Keenan, Oklahoma. But that   s all that was there, and then about a  half a mile west of the post office was the school; a little school building and I  think that little building is still there. It   s about the only little school building     country school building   I guess that   s left. Here a few years ago they kind of  wanted to bring it up here and arrange it along with our museum here in  Woodward and fix it up like it was back when we had school down there. But I  had an average daily attendance down there of 14 I believe.  And was that from 1st grade through 12th grade?  No, it was 1st grade through 8th.  Eighth grade. Okay.  What was it like teaching there?  Well, I didn   t know that it wasn   t any different that teaching anywhere else.  (Laughs) And because that was my first year to teach, well, it was the second  year to teach at Keenan. But I don   t know, we just had a good time.  On real cold days, the kids would bring some things from home, like extra  milk or whatever we needed, and we   d fix a kettle of soup on the stove. And  they   d bring their regular lunch but then they   d bring their tin cups and a spoon  so that they could have a cup of hot soup.  We worked real hard to improve the building and the school and all. We did  get   I don   t remember what we called it now   a kind of a credit for the  improvements that we did, that we made. I enjoyed teaching down there even  though there was a grade or two I didn   t have. I didn   t have a primary student,  a little one just six years old and starting. I didn   t have one. I believe third  grade was the first grade, and then I had third and fourth, fifth, sixth, and  10  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  maybe I had one in the seventh grade. It seems like there were three eighth  grade students, but most of them there were just one or two of them in each  class. To get all the different subjects in, I had to double up sometimes like  have let   s say fifth and sixth grade spelling at the same time. Give one word to  the fifth grade student and a word to the sixth and back and forth until we  would have our words for the day.  Do you remember what your salary was when you were teaching there?   90 a month.  Was that pretty good for that time?  Oh yes  For teaching out in a country school that was good money. Lottie got   85 dollars at the school just east of me. The first year that I taught with only  the four children I got  90 a month, I got  90 a month those two years. I saved  a whole lot of it, thank goodness, because when the three of us went  to  Stillwater , Lottie had saved a lot of her money, too, and we had that to go to  school on. And the three of us went the full term and then I went that summer  and finished up and got my degree at the end of summer session.  Wow, you must have worked really hard.  I did. I carried 18 hours  Every year I carried 18 hours.  Well you knew how hard it was to get there; you were going to make full  advantage of it, weren   t you?  I did, and I knew just exactly how much it was costing and who paid for most  of it, and I didn   t intend to waste any of it. So I did make good grades, it  wasn   t very hard to make the Dean   s list, I believe that   s what we called it at  that time, but I think they have some other categories now. Yes, I worked  pretty hard; I carried nine hours that summer that I graduated.  That   s a heavy load for summer school.  Yes, it is.  When the Depression hit, what in your life changed? What made you realize  that times were different, it was harder now?  Well, when Mama wrote and told me that Papa had been hearing talk here in  Woodward. He would come once each week to town and do all the things that  he needed to do and visit and all. Papa had heard them talking about the banks  were going to close and things like that. They wondered what Lottie and I  thought about taking our bank accounts, what we had in the bank that we were  using right then to go to school on, to take it out of the bank. So we wrote back  and said, well maybe we   d better. So they checked it out. Is this thing  operating?  11  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Yes.  I might not say this then.  (Laughs) Oh now, if you   re censoring what you say, I shouldn   t have told you   Can we turn it off and you   ll tell us? (Laughs)  Yeah, anyway, they took the money out of the bank and kept it at home and  they would send us  20 at a time, whenever we needed it. Well, just when we  enrolled and had to get our books and supplies and things, that   s when we  needed the most money. So they would send us money.  Mama was so worried because she thought Leone wasn   t going to get to go to  school, and I said    Well, Mama, don   t worry about it. Lottie and I are going  and we   ll just take her along with us, and we   ll just get a little apartment and it  won   t cost anymore for her to be there than not to be there than it   s gonna cost  me and Lottie anyway.    So we went on, and at the time we went, it didn   t  seem so hard but when the bank closed and we realized that if our money had  been in there we would have had to have gone home. We couldn   t have stayed  in Stillwater and even finished up that semester and we would have lost about  half a semester   s work and everything. That   s the thing that I remember the  most about it being so hard.  Then I graduated at the end of the summer school and Lottie had completed a  little more than two years of work. She might have had about, two, four, five  semesters of work maybe. Leone then had one year   s work, and we could not  find a job anywhere. We were at home, out there on the farm, and back to  scratch you might say. Because we really had to live at home and so then the  next year we did find schools that we could teach. I taught at Sharon at the  high school there. I taught home economics and science. Then Lottie and  Leone, we still had our little country schools out in the country, and they  taught in a couple of those little schools. So things went along very well after  that, but that really made you know that it was hard. Of course, I still got  90  teaching in high school. Lottie and Leone taught for  50 a month then, when  they had been paying  85 and  90 out, so that was quite a demotion.  They were probably glad just to have jobs.  Oh yes, yes. It was just great to have work. They taught then for about five  years I guess, and then that one year that I taught down at Sharon after I got  my degree. Well again, I wasn   t very extravagant with my money and I  decided that I wanted to go back to school and work on my master   s. And I  wanted to go to Ames, Iowa, to Iowa State. I did go up there and while I was  up there, I got an offer from Arkansas Extension Service to work as a home  demonstration agent we were called in those days.  break in tape      to work for my master   s degree or to come and take the job. She wrote back  and told me to stay. But it wasn   t very long till I got a letter from them and  they told me that if I wanted to come and take a position with them that they  12  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  wanted me to come now. So then I checked out, I was running out of money,  and I checked out and went down there and went to work and worked 37 years.  (Laughs) And I really enjoyed that. But that was the thing that I wanted to do, I  didn   t want to be a school teacher, a classroom teacher. I always wanted to do  extension work and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  What did your job consist of? What did you do as your position?  In extension, you mean?  Yes.  Well, we were called home demonstration agents at that time and we worked  with groups of women showing   well, in Arkansas I was the first agent in one  of the counties that I worked in, and the other county, the agent was just kind  of on paper. I mean she was supposed to work in the county but she had two  counties and so she just came up into this county  more than  once or twice. So  you might say I not worked, the two counties had never had an agent.  So what counties did you work in?  I worked in Sharp County and Clay County and where Mountain Home is the  county seat, is that Baxter County?  Yes, I believe so.  I believe that   s what it was. When I went  to Arkansas , they gave me both  Baxter and Sharp. I worked two weeks in each county, and I went there the  first of May. I organized clubs for the women, and we would meet and some  of the women had never seen a pressure cooker to do any kind of canning or  anything. But they knew about them and they kind of thought they were  dangerous and that they might explode. And I remember going to one club  meeting and so I told them,    Now I   m going to let this pressure go high  enough that it will pop off.    One lady got up and took her two little children  and went outside. (Laughs)  If you were going to blow the place up, she didn   t want to be there  (Laughter)  She didn   t want to be there, but I thought;    Now that   s all right. She   s  concerned about herself and those two children and I don   t blame her a bit.     And so it did and they all could see how it wasn   t as dangerous as it sounded,  but still I didn   t want them to get too brave because it could be dangerous.  We worked on canning and another government program. You know that was  right in the Depression and we were just barely kind of starting to creep out.  And they had what they call canning kitchens and they either used a house that  was not being lived in or they built a little one room building, only it was  pretty good sized. They had big retorts there and equipment to work with and  the women could bring their vegetables and fruits to these kitchens and can the  food, then have it then for winter use. So they were learning to can and of  13  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  course, they had no idea much about nutrition, I mean as far as what the  different foods contained and how they nourished the body and so on, and so  we had that. Well then of course, they were interested in learning how to sew.  Most of them made a lot of their clothes. They didn   t buy many already made  things and so we did some work in clothing and some work in improving  kitchens and making them a little more convenient and teaching them how to  do their work a little more efficiently. For example, if you were going to clean  the cabinet, start at the top shelf and come down don   t start at the bottom shelf  and go up. But now you   d be surprised at how many people   women   would  do the opposite. They   d start on the first floor and go up. Oh, we worked with  things like that.  Then we had our 4-H clubs and of course they worked on the same kinds of  things. The little girls learned to follow a recipe and make cookies or  cornbread or biscuits or mashed potatoes or whatever. And the little boys, of  course I don   t know very much about their work because the county agent took  care of the boys    program, but they would have their pig to take care of or a  calf or a plot of cotton or corn or whatever.  I enjoyed it. And over the 37 years, I got pretty good results, I thought. I had a  number of girls to make the Chicago trip that I had made. I believe it was the  third year that they had held this national convention for 4-H   ers when I went,  and then I can   t remember how many girls but there were several of them. One  year, I had two to go the same year. That was really good because they tried to  spread it around a little bit, not that they didn   t let the one that had a real good  record go, and maybe take one that maybe hadn   t done quite as much work. I  think they were honest in their selections. But Clay County had somebody just  every few years. Sometimes it   d be two three years between times but then  sometimes it would be one every year for two or three years.  Now, when you were over in Arkansas, did you make trips back over to this  area to see your parents and sisters very often?  Yes, oh yes.  And what did you think about the difference between how things were where  you were in Arkansas and coming back over here, did it seem like there was a  noticeable difference in the conditions?  Yes, I could detect a noticeable difference, but let   s not discuss that.  Okay     (Laughs)  Well, let   s talk about something then on the other direction, very positive. It   s  very clear you   re working very hard and you   re doing so many different  things. But I can   t believe you can tell me you never did anything for fun. So  what kind of things did you do for fun or entertainment?  14  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Did you ever have any time for yourself? It sounds like an incredible job.  Really, I never have been a person for much recreation. There   s just always  been too much that I wanted to do. As a kid we would go on picnics and I  always had a pony to ride.  What was your pony   s name?  Dobin   and I like to go horseback riding and Papa got us a saddle. Lottie and  Leone didn   t ride as much as I did. I did most of the riding. I liked to ride. My  4-H club work was sort of recreational to me, you know like going on the  different trips and things like that were recreational.  In the summertime a lot of times, Papa would go by the ice plant here in  Woodward and get a 25 pound chunk of ice and bring it home. We had an ice  cream freezer. So we   d invite some of the neighbors to come and we   d have an  ice cream supper and visit and us kids would play games of one kind or  another.  Do you remember what kinds of games you played when all the neighbor kids  were over?  Oh, we would throw the ball over the house and catch it and run around the  house and so on. We   d play    lose your supper.     Now how do you play that?  What   s lose your supper?  Oh, you form a ring and then two, we always had two that would go around  the outside of the circle and then they would touch the hands. In the circle they  were all holding hands. They   d touch the hands of two, then the point was to  one goes one way and they other goes the other way and see who could get  back to this place first.  Well, if could get back first, well, fine. You could rest a little while. If the one  that you had touched beat you back, then you had to do the whole thing over  again, and then try to find another couple that you could beat around the circle.  (Laughter) Oh, I don   t know, but just little games like that, that we played.  Did you ever lose your supper playing that game?  Oh yes, (Laughter) yes lots of times I couldn   t run as fast as whoever it was  that we had selected to race around against. But it was fun, and it was good  exercise for us.  When did you get married?  When did I get married? I married June the 30th 1940. I married a young man,  he was in the funeral home business and we built us a home in the town. After  I married, then I didn   t consider moving to a different county you know. So  15  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  we built us a little home and we didn   t have any children. I was past 30 and so  was he; there was just four months difference in our ages. He was four months  older than I was.  I was going to ask you if he was older or younger.  His birthday was the 8th of February and mine was the 5th of June, and so that   s  the difference in our ages.  And was he a native of that area?  Yes, yes. We lived there. When we married, the European situation was very  unstable and already they were talking war. Before our first anniversary, he  was gone. He was gone four years and didn   t come back home. When you first  went in, you know, he was only in the United States it seems to me like maybe  five months or something like that. It wasn   t very long because they put him in  the Quartermaster Corps and he was sent to Iran.  Well, there was a railroad and they built the highway up through Iran or Iraq or  maybe partly in both of them. The point was to transport supplies up on the  back side of Germany into Russia to support the Russian army. And Clifford  said that the Russians didn   t leave any space unfilled. If they were receiving  trucks to use, they didn   t take them empty. They filled them to take them up  there. They made every minute count because at that time St. Petersburg was  under siege, and they couldn   t get anything in or out and the rest of the country  was nearly as bad and they just were needing lots of help and they made every  minute count. He was there on that supply line, I guess you   d call it, the full  time of the war. But he said at times, the German forces were so strong coming  down through southeastern Europe, like through Turkey and all, that they just  didn   t know whether they were going to break through and they   d be having to  do something besides work on that supply line. It was pretty hairy at times, I  guess.  So did he spend the entire time abroad in that area?  Yes, I think after he had been there about two years then he got a furlough of  30 days and he decided to come over into Israel, or where Israel is now, and  visit the Holy Land and so he got to do that. One time he said they got leave  and went up on the Caspian Sea. He enjoyed swimming and being up there a  while. Otherwise, he was there working. And I knew when they left the United  States, but I didn   t get a letter for seven months.  That must have been really hard.  Well it was. I felt like everything was all right but when he got back he said  they boarded their ship, and now I don   t remember just where, does Newport  News have a harbor?  Yes, that   s where there   s a big naval operation there.  16  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  There, okay. I believe that   s where they left from and he said they sailed down  the east coast and across to South America, they touched where Brazil comes  out there, some port along there they touched. Then when they started the next  one, that was diagonal across to the tip of Africa down there.  To avoid all the German submarines.  That they could, but he said they just never did know when they were going to  meet a torpedo. But they made it around and then back up the east side of  Africa to the port, and I should know that because they   re still there today.  And did they go up to Istanbul up through the Mediterranean the Bosphorus or  around?  No. No, they went through the Indian Ocean and just around Africa and back  up to Iran. But I don   t know whether it was Aden or what seaport there that, I  just can   t remember. I hadn   t recalled that so much, but anyway back to  getting married. Then he was gone that four years. Well, then when he came  back, it took through a year or two to get kind of squared away again and by  that time we were getting to be about 40 years old and we just decided not to  have any children, so we didn   t have any. Then he died at age 70.  So did you live in Arkansas that entire time?  Yes, lived in the same town where he had lived all his life. He was, like they  say, he was born and reared and buried there.  Now had his father been in the funeral business, too? Is that how he got into  it?  No, no. I don   t know, the man that really owned the business, they had known  each other for a long time and Mr. Russell needed some help. This was in the  Depression time now, and if you could make enough to have board and room,  you were doing pretty good.  So anyway, I think Clifford maybe was just working at a soda fountain there in  one of the drugstores or something like that. He decided then to change over,  so he went to work with Mr. Russell in that funeral home. Mr. Russell taught  him how to do the embalming and everything. But before we married, he took  time out and went to school and got his certificate or whatever you would call  it and came back and passed the state board and then he could work anywhere  in the state. But we just stayed put and it was a pretty good county for me to  work in. It wasn   t so rough and all as it was over around Mountain Home. I  couldn   t get out of that town without having to ferry a river  The roads were  pretty good in Clay County, and I liked the people and they seemed to like me  and so time just passed. (Laughs)  So what made you decide to go back and get your master   s degree?  Oh, I just always wanted it. Well, they were kind of insisting that we all have  17  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  master   s degrees and most of the home demonstration agents, most of the  women who were working, had gone back and got their master   s. So I went  back just in the summers and finished up. I went out to Arizona to the  University of Arizona one winter and took   I only did three hours work out  there, but it was just a three week deal and the rest of my work I did at the  University of Arkansas then in the summers. Six weeks or then one summer I  went nine weeks, I think.  So how did that work then? Did you get a leave of absence from your job?  Since they were requiring that you get this degree, were they willing to have  you do that as part of your work day to take the classes?  I believe they did give us time. Now I went one summer up to the University  of Missouri, and I had to use my annual leave for that. But I believe, in the  summers when I went over at the University of Arkansas, I believe they did  give us time. I haven   t thought about that in so long that I   m not right sure but  I think they did. I don   t believe they gave up a stipend of any kind, any  amount, I think we had to pay our own way but they gave us time. I just can   t  remember for sure about that.  Well, there   s one more sort of a wrap-up question about depression era stuff.  How do you think having lived through the Depression has changed who you  are and affected who you are today?  Well, I don   t know exactly whether it was the Depression or a combination of  both. Or whether it   s in my genes. My great grandmother was three years old  when her family came to America from Germany and they evidently were very  frugal people and very hard working people. And they came to the United  States and on to the mid-northern area in Missouri around Warrensburg up  there. They really progressed and they made a good living and they  accumulated, well, what they called wealth in those days. It might not be so  much now, but they all had good farms and all.  And this grandmother of mine seemed to be extra saving, had a nature to save  things and keep things. She seemed to have a knack of when she got a hold of  something, she could hold on to it. And she did buy quite a bit of land. She  owned quite a bit of land up there and had quite an estate when she passed  away. I   m a little bit turned that way.  I don   t spend a lot of money for things that I don   t need and things that don   t  really satisfy. I do seem to have that knack that she had of being able to hold  on to things once I get it. So in the Depression, we were so really poor. I don   t  think we had as much as welfare people have now, about the only comparison  I can think of.  It was hard to own an automobile, you know, to have that much money and  you surely didn   t have enough money to take vacations in the middle of the  summer for two weeks or something. And as I say, we never did go hungry  and we never did go without warm clothing and good beds and we never did  without having wood to burn or coal, as the case might be. We always had  18  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  plenty but we didn   t have any extra. And that has stayed with me. We didn   t  waste anything and I still don   t waste anything.  I think maybe that the way I feel about Christian living has something to do  with it, too. I don   t say very much about it to anybody, but I really don   t feel  like that people ought to spend money for really expensive things when a less  expensive thing will serve just as well and will get them where they want to  go. Well, you can see where I   m living and what I have now. It isn   t anything  grand or expensive or anything. This carpet was in the house when I bought it  20 years ago.  Well, if it is suiting your needs, then that   s fine.  That   s the way I feel about it. If it   s comfortable, and if it   s a place where I   m  good and warm in the winter and I   m cool in the summer, and I have plenty to  eat and plenty to wear, and a car that gets me where I want to go or need to go,  which isn   t very far now days, (Laughter) I don   t see the point in spending  money and I do think that we do have an obligation to assist   I   m going to use  the word society for lack of being able to think of a better word. But like the  scholarship funds. I don   t feel obligated to do it, but I want to do it. I think we  ought to help one another. So maybe that answers your question, I don   t know.  What is the importance of education to your family? And were you the first in  your family to go to college?  I don   t know how we would have managed to have gotten to a high school.  There was a high school at Sharon which was about five miles from where we  lived the way you had to go. As the crow would fly, about four probably, but  we couldn   t get that far with a horse and buggy for transportation and that   s all  anyone had then. Yes, getting an education was very important, and our  scholarship in the College of Education over there is a memorial to our  parents.  That   s really nice. That must have made you feel really good that you could do  something in their memory.  Yes, and what else did you ask? There   s something else that you said.  Oh, if you were just the first one?  Oh yes, if I was the first one. Well, in my immediate family, of course, I was.  I have a cousin who is a little older than I, and she got her degree, of course, a  little before I did. I never did know her. She and her parents lived in  Washington state or Oregon, one or the other. They lived both places. Her first  degree was in music, then she went to the University of Illinois, and her  master   s is in chemistry (laughter), isn   t that crazy?  That is, and for somebody that could use her right brain and left brain, too.  That   s amazing.  19  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Oh, I can   t do that. I couldn   t learn to type, I couldn   t learn to play the piano; I  can   t do something with one hand and something else with the other hand at  the same time. But she has her degree, and she has a brother 17 years younger  than she was that has a degree. And then another cousin that had a doctorate in  psychology, I believe it is. Anyway, he worked at counseling work and that  type of thing. Let   s see, how many more do I have on Papa   s side? I only have  one first cousin, first cousin once removed, it   s my cousin   s child, that has a  college degree. And I believe that he   s the only one in Papa   s family that   s any  relation to me. My father was born in north Missouri, you know where.  He was born near Warrensburg?  Yeah and when he was about, oh I think maybe like 12 years old, I think he  maybe was in the fourth grade at school or something like that. And I don   t  know why Grandpa Herd decided to move, but he came down in the southwest  corner of Missouri, close to Joplin, and they were there a year or so   this was  before 1889 because they were in Oklahoma territory by 1889, and he never  did go back to school. Well, there wasn   t any schools much to go to, but I   m  pretty sure being a boy he didn   t want to go to school, because I don   t know  very many boys that do want to go to school  (Laughter)  And Mother was born and reared in West Virginia in Greenbrier County.  There   s a town there by the name of name Hinton   Hinton, West Virginia     that was not too far from where they lived, but they lived in the mountainous  region down in there, kind of the northern tip of the Blue Ridge Mountains in  there. She was 21 when they came to Oklahoma in 1908. Grandpa and the  oldest boy of the family had come out here in 1907 along in the summertime,  like July or August maybe, and then they wrote back for my grandmother, and  this oldest son was married by that time to his wife. So Grandma and Uncle  Wayne   s wife had came all the way from West Virginia by themselves, and  they had never been anywhere. (Laughter)  Oh my gosh, what an adventure   I don   t know how they ever maneuvered, but they got to Woodward. (Laughs)  Wow, and what a shock too to go from the lush sort of mountains of West  Virginia out here.  Out here, but you know they said that that had been a good year, and they   d  had lots of moisture and the crops were good, of course  So it looked pretty good out here   It wasn   t so bad you know. Well the land hadn   t been farmed and tilled but just  a very few years, so it looked good. So then in the spring, Mama was 21, and  then the brother that was just younger than she was, they were the two oldest  ones. Then they had three younger brothers and a sister, and on top of that,  then they had their grandparents which would be my great grandparents and  they were up in their sixties. But at 60 then, they were as old as I am at 92.  20  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  See, I   m gonna be 92 here in a few days   But they were already old people then. Well these two young kids, they were  both 20, Mama was 21 and Uncle Kalb was 22, they had a sale and sold  everything they had at an auction, except what they were bringing with them.  They could bring I believe it was 100 or 150 pounds per ticket with them in the  way of baggage and I guess they did. They packed up and brought things that  weren   t very important, I didn   t think, and I still got a few of them.  Oh, how wonderful.  One of the funny little things that happened, this little girl, she was about 12, I  guess or13, and she ripped her coat lining here and then she poked all of her  valuables in this coat and can you imagine what    (Laughter)  Pretty good thinking, though, for a 12 year old.  Yeah, but little keepsakes and things that she treasured. She had them all in her  coat  (Laughs) Oh, that just tickles me nearly to death every time I think of it   But there they were. And on top of that, somewhere along the way they got  exposed to the measles. They hadn   t been here but of course about two weeks,  less than two weeks, and the whole bunch of them came down with measles.  They really had a time. Uncle Wayne lost their son and then his wife had a  miscarriage from it, and they lost Grandma and Grandpa. Their youngest one  was only about four or five years old when they came out here, they lost him.  All to the measles?  All to the measles, from having those measles. So it was just really, really bad  that first year that they were out here. But those younger children, Uncle Gus  and Uncle Reanis and Aunt Bird, they all finished the eighth grade out here in  school. And Aunt Bird, of course they didn   t require so much of teachers, but  she taught several years here in the schools. She never did get a degree of  anything, but she did go to what they called Normal School up at Alva a  summer or two.  But we three and Rita my cousin, and Kenneth my cousin and this first cousin  once removed, his name is   I get too many names now, it   s getting twisted up  in my head. Well we called him LD, his name was Lloyd Daniel I believe, but  he got a degree. They lived in Kansas and he got a degree up there. Then I did  have another Uncle Reanis   s, one of his boys got a college degree. You can  pretty nearly count them on your fingers how many people in my family have  degrees, but I was one of the earliest ones, the first ones.  What was your mother   s family name, I don   t think I asked you that?  Loudermilk, though Luttermilch might be an alternative spelling. The first  Loudermilks that came over here, their name was Luttermilch, something like  that. It was a German name, you see, and how it got to be Loudermilk, I don   t  21  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  know. But they say when those foreign people came through Ellis Island that  they just gave them a name. They couldn   t tell what they were saying in their  native language or what it meant or anything. So maybe there was something  there, but anyway in a couple of generations it got down to Loudermilk, but  there are one branch that spells it Laudermilk, but that   s not the long family  name, long range family name or whatever you   d call it. I   ve done a lot of  work on our family, and I know all my grandfather and my great grandfather  and my great great and my great great great on back to about, I believe they  were in Germany yet, 17 and something before the first ones came over. And  there were just two, two Loudermilks came over.  I think there were some Loudermilks in Shattuck. Is that part of your family?  Well, that might have been my Uncle Kalb. He married, let me see now if I  can get her name, Katie Peters, the Peters    out there.  That   s right. Someone that works in my office is from that Peters family.  Oh?  Yes, so he was telling us all about that before Shelly made her first trip out to  Shattuck.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, but I had no idea that that was part of your family, too.  David will be excited. He might call you up. David is a real genealogist, so he  might call you up and say,    I   m coming to visit.     Well if he wants to come, I   d be glad for him to come. Yes, Aunt Katie was a  precious person.  Now she wasn   t the one with the millinery shop, was she? The Peters?  Oh, I think so. They had some kind of store there but I just thought it was kind  of a general mercantile store. But back in those days, they did have somebody  that could make hats and trim hats and do all that you know. What I was gonna  say about Aunt Katie, she committed suicide, and that was just heartbreaking.  We loved her.  According to the stories that David has told us, she was quite attractive.  She was, she was just precious. We just liked her a whole lot. She and Uncle  Kalb had two little boys: Albert and, well we called the other one Nick; I  think his real name was Alfred. But Aunt Katie, she still talked a lot of the  German language and when Nick was just a tiny baby she   d tickle him and talk  to him and everything and she   d call him    Nick nook, nick nook     Nicht gut,  nicht gut  and we said    What does nick nook  nicht gut  mean, Aunt Katie?     And she says,    Well, it means something like    No good   .    (Laughter). That  22  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  you   re no good.  Sounds like the perfect endearment for a little boy.  And then I didn   t ever know Nick as well as I did Albert. I wasn   t at home  then either, but this was back during the Depression when times was so hard.  Uncle Kalb had taken Aunt Katie and the boys, and they had moved out to a  farm down there by where I taught school, in that area. It was only a few miles  south and maybe a little more east, and it was hard for Albert to even get  started to school. So they brought him up and left him with Mama, and Mama  would get him ready and we had a school bus. Not the nice kind they have  now, but just a pick up truck with a thing built on the back, you know, and  she   d send him to school. So he went his first year of school, or most of his  first year of school out here at Tangier, and he was just a precious little boy.  Mama enjoyed having him so much. The nest had emptied, and Mama was just  there by herself all day long and all day long, and having Albert to get up and  get him off to school and then he   d come in, in the evening and everything and  she just really enjoyed having him. But the times was just awful hard on Aunt  Katie and living way out there in the country and nobody ever coming or going  or anything and she just got so depressed that she just couldn   t stand it, I  guess.  Well, your Uncle Kalb, was he your mother   s brother or your father   s brother?  Mother. Mama   s brother.  So he was Kalb Loudermilk?  Yes.  We   re going to have to report on this relationship exactly.  Well, let   s see, what was Uncle Kalb   s name? DeKalb, George. George  DeKalb was his name. Grandpa named all of the boys for somebody  important. The first one was Pulaski Wayne.  That   s quite a name.  Well Pulaski and Wayne were both generals. The next one was George  DeKalb for George Washington and DeKalb was another general, I believe.  And then who was next, the next one was Harrison. What was the rest of his  name? (Laughs) Something Harrison. Maybe I   ll think of it pretty soon. Well,  Harrison was, wasn   t he president?  Yes, Benjamin Harrison.  President Harrison, okay, and then there was, what was the next boy? I guess it  was Uncle Gus. We always kidded, we always had a lot of fun with him  because his name, they said his name was Gustavus Adolphus. (Laughter)  23  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Lemons  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Paustenbaugh  Lehman  Now you know why he went by Gus   Yes. Thaddius. Thaddius Gustavus Adolphus.  (Laughter) Oh, my word.  So he left off the Adolphus and then he just used the Gus part of Thaddius  Augusta, well.  Sounds like a good decision. (Laughter)  Well, they were all different important people you know. Then Jay Lorenzo,  and Jay was one of the founders.  John Jay.  John Jay, yes, and Lorenzo, who was he? Anyway, and then the little one that  died was Curtis Oswald.  They   re getting better towards the end there.  Yes, well Curtis, oh let   s see, the Oswald was the name of the doctor that took  care of Grandma when she had the baby, and Curtis was for somebody, I don   t  know who in history. But Grandpa cooked up. (Laughs)  But they only had three girls. They had more boys than they had girls. So the  girl   s was Lillian Swan, and Mama   s name was Marie Luezell. And then Aunt  Bird was named for her grandmothers, Rebecca Bird. So that takes care of the  Loudermilk family.  No, the Herd families, they were all German but this great grandmother that I  was telling you about, her name was Dierking, and there were a couple of the  Dierking men that came over here from Germany and they were here a couple  of years or so, and one of them went back to Germany and told the whole  family. Well there was just an exodus of Dierking   s that came to the United  States.  And how do you spell that last name?  I think it   s D-I-E-R-K-I-N-G.  Okay, because my husband   s mother   s maiden name is Dierker, which is the  same root but E-R on the end.  And just lots of the family came, so we had lots of Dierking relatives up there.  -------  -------
