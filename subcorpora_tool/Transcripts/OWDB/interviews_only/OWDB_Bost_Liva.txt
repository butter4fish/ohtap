Now, in the dust bowl, what changes in your role as a woman in the family  because of the needs of time?  At the time of the dust bowl, we lived in western Oklahoma. It was not all  farm; it was either rural or a community. The needs were just ordinary needs,  because everything was just always covered with dust, the curtains, the  household, anything around the house was always dusty, and of course outside.  All over the machinery. The dust was ever present.  How were your material possessions effected, your house, car, clothes, and  appliances?  Well, we didn   t have any appliances.  Did you prepare for approaching dusters?  I don   t remember that.  Was there any time to prepare? Were there any warnings or signals from  animals?  Not like there would be now, like a television or radio or anything like that. I  don   t remember that there was anything.  Did anyone in your family flee the dust bowl?  No.  Were there any neighbors or friends who left?  No.  Did you have any encounters with gypsies, tramps, or hobos?  No, not at that time.  How did the dust storms change daily life? How did you do the laundry and  sleep with that dust coming in and prepare the house for the storms?  It wasn   t like you saw in the movies that portray the dust bowl, when the dust  would just be thick. It was just continuous; it was just always there. We  would hang wet sheets over the windows.  What did you think about the first time you saw a dust storm?  6  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  I don   t know that I ever saw one like portrayed in movies.  What did it look like outside after a duster?  The dust was a thick as it had been before.  Why did you stay in Oklahoma?  Well, in the first place because it was my home, and we lived right there.  Our  neighbors  both taught school, and they had a job, a secret set up for if we  needed help. It just didn   t occur to us to leave. I don   t know why we stayed  there, I don   t know why.  What constituted hard times?  The main thing that caused hard times was the depression. I fondly remember  the dust bowl, and for us, the economy declining, when the banks failed. The  government came in and put stops on the wool and wheat. That constituted  hard times. We were very poor.  Did your family receive any type of assistance to deal with hard times?  No.  No public or private church funds or supporting agencies or anything like  that?  No.  What is your most vivid memory of the dust bowl?  Where I lived it didn   t seem to be any worse than any other time.  What were your political views before?  Well, I don   t imagine it was of much concern for me at the time. I know that  we did notice after and during the depression that we were very much into  different changes, especially with money.  What were some of the changes because of your experience and some of the  common complaints about the    New Deal    programs?  Most of those programs were good. I remember really appreciating  Roosevelt   s efforts. He seemed to be a very wealthy man, who really took a  thought of people who didn   t have enough money. Money was really our  problem. And then when banks closed at one time, they shut down, we didn   t  get the money that we had.  7  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  L. Bost  P. Bost  Were there any alterations of your views toward the environment?  No. As I said, we were not farmers. We just had to live on the land a couple  years in the summertime. In the school teaching business, it was just a job.  And John had a school teaching job in the winter, that was about the best you  could do.  At the time, what was your impression of the dust bowl and the great  depression?  Well, it was     What was the general consensus for the cause of the dust storms?  The dust storms were caused, of course, by the plowing up of all the prairie  land for planting wheat. The bumper crops that made us all so very rich, and  then we didn   t get the rain, and the land just all blew away, and we didn   t have  any more wheat crops.  How do you feel about the area today?  Well, I feel about the same. I love it because it   s my home. However I do  always notice when I   m on prairies that I feel so vulnerable. Not protected  like I fell in the hills of Kentucky.  Did you have nightmares about the dust?  No, in fact, I don   t remember much about them. I just remember about the  depression.  How would you say that you have been changed by your dust bowl  experience?  Oh, I know that those are very real, very really a part of my life, and it has  affected me greatly.  Were those changes permanent?  I   m sure they were, although I   ve thought many times of what makes  Oklahomans strong. It   s the mighty wind that blows and holds them up so  they can stand straight and tall. I have always felt that western strength.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
