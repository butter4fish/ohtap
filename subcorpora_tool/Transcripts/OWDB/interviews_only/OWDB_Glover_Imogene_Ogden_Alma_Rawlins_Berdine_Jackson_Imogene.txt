 Lemons  Kite  Rawlins  Okay, we   re going to start and let each of you introduce yourselves on the tape  so that when they transcribe the tape the first thing that they will hear is you  saying your name, where and when you were born, and after that we   ll get into  dust bowl questions.  I   m Imogene Glover, I was Imogene Davison. I was born north of Texhoma  close to Elkhart, Kansas in what is considered the center of the dustbowl. This  is according to the group that came out from Washington D.C. and did the  survey of the dust bowl area during that time.  What year were you born?  I was born the 4th of November, 1924.  I   m Alma Ogden. I was born in Hardwood, Oklahoma, March 5, 1929, and I  now live in Farmington, New Mexico. Hardwood no longer exists as a town.  It   s near Atoka.  All right, okay.  But that   s what my birth certificate says is Hardwood. My mother is Alberta  Shiflett, she was born at Range and has lived here in this area many years and  grew up here during the dust bowl days. Her maiden name was Ross.  I   m Berdine Shiflett Rawlins. My folks actually lived at Goodwell when I was  born but I was born at Fort Collins, Colorado because my dad was going to  college out there that summer. Alma Ogden   s my sister and my folks, my  grandparents Ina and John Ross homesteaded in the Hardesty area in 1901.  So your family   s been here for a long time.  When were you born?  Oh, I was born June the 30th, 1925, and married Orwell Rawlins, he was born  at Tyrone, Oklahoma in 1924.  5  Jackson  Lemons  Glover  Jackson  Ogden  Jackson  Lemons  Rawlins  Kite  Glover  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  I   m Imogene Mitchell Jackson. I was born 7 miles south of Tyrone on January  11, 1918. I   ve lived in Hooker, that area, and Hooker all my life.  Well we   re just going to start talking about what kind of places you lived.  Would you consider where you lived a rural area or more of a city area?  It was definite rural. I was born so far out in the country that they went to  Elkhart, Kansas to get Dr. Tucker to deliver me.  Well they tell me that I was delivered without a doctor, he got there later  because it was stormy, and every year on my birthday nearly, it always snows  or it is stormy.  Now what is your birthday?  January 11th, that   s a good time for storms. Very seldom is it a clean day. Kids  had my birthday party, my 80th birthday and it was terrible. It snowed and they  had to get out and use the snow blower and everything.  My goodness.  I guess I was born in the big city of Fort Collins, Colorado. I have no idea  what it looked like then or what it looks like now. (Laughs) But my folks lived  at Goodwell and Goodwell was a great big town, of course.  Right.  It was bigger then than it is now.  Yes it was. My dad was teaching school at the PAI and my mother     Was a student.  Right, well not when I was born.  Well, when they met.  Right.  Well so if you all kind of have a rural background, describe for us the kind of  house where you lived. Was it a big house, was it little, how many rooms did it  have, anything you remember about it.  The house at Goodwell where my folks lived was a little three room house.  How many people where living in the three-roomed house?  Well when they first got married, I   m the second child so there were four of us  then.  6  Ogden  Lemons  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Glover  Lemons  Glover  Jackson  Lemons  Glover  Lemons  Jackson  Lemons  Jackson  But then the family moved away from there and lived in different places in  Oklahoma, and then we moved back there when I was a senior in high school  and it was still three rooms and there were still eight children at home.  Oh my gosh.  And the house is still there. Daddy built all around it, but the three rooms are  still intact right there in the middle of it. My grandsons live there now.  In Goodwell?  Yes.  I lived in a two-roomed house and later during the dirty thirties a cyclone or  tornado picked it up and turned it around and set it back down on the same  foundation. It was called the    Gose place    and it was near what   s Four Corners  Caf   Oklahoma now out on 64 highway.  Why is it called the    Gose place?     Well the Goses lived there before my folks did and I think that they probably  moved back there later, the Goses did, but that was the reason it was called the  Gose place.  I thought maybe it was the ghosts that caused it to be set back down on the  same foundation. (Laughter)  Yeah.  But during the dirty thirties I grew up in a three room house and actually it was  one big room with a shed built on the north where the kitchen and a tiny  bedroom   and then there was another little edition that was what mother  called the   it would be now the utility room but it was sort of a back porch  room where they brought in the milk and took care of that and there was a  wash stand there. Anyway, it was really a lean-to on this one big room and  that   s the picture that I have in my mind of a lot of the houses at that time.  Yeah, does this sound similar to the house where you lived?  No, I was fortunate. I lived in a five-room house. (Laughs)  With how many people?  Well there was, I had two brothers and a sister and my daddy. My mother died  when I was six months old. Then Dad remarried when I was almost nine and  so all of us lived there. The back porch I guess is what it was, they closed in  because this brother became an invalid from arthritis and so he was an invalid  all   well he died on my 30th birthday.  7  Lemons  Jackson  Kite  Rawlins  Kite  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Glover  Rawlins  And this was your brother?  My dad never did, they never did have anymore children, it was just the four  of us.  I was gonna ask about the logistics of having eight kids, a Mom and a Dad in a  three room house.  We had a bedroom and living room and a kitchen.  Did you all sleep   ?  No, well one place we lived we had three rooms and the house didn   t have any  ceiling in it, just had rafters and Daddy put     And I slept up on the rafters.  Two people slept up there on the rafters, up in the attic part and every night  Momma put a mattress on the kitchen table and two or three slept in there.  The little kids slept on the table.  Yeah, and then we had one bed in the living room, which was the middle  room.  A big bed that three people could sleep in.  And Mom and Daddy had the other room and there were two beds in there and  then later Daddy made a bunk bed out of one big bed so there was a big bed  with a bunk bed on top of it and another bed over here and then a bed in the  living room and a bed on the kitchen table. (Laughter)  Where was the best place, where did you always want to be?  Wherever they told us to sleep.  Wherever there was a place to sleep.  Until I got great big, three of us slept in one bed together all the time and Alma  was the fourth one in the family and she got a cot all by herself and we were  all very envious  (Laughs)  I went to visit Thrashers that lived across about a mile and a half from us and  they had 11 children sort of like this, and we   d go over and spend the night on  Saturday night quite often so we could go to church on Sunday morning with  them and there would be five of us kids sleeping in the same bed, three on one  end and two on the bottom, and our feet would go up between the other kids.  Well this story beats that. My husband   s folks had a twin bed when they got  8  Rawlins  Jackson  Rawlins  Lemon  Ogden  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Lemons  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Lemons  Ogden  Glover  Lemons  married and after they had three children they all slept in that twin bed. The  Mom and Daddy at one end and the three kids at the other, and I said I don   t  know how any of them ever slept  But see there were ten children in our  family all together and I remember one time when my cousin was getting  ready to go to the service, this was in the    40   s, they came in, we were at  Goodwell, they came in to spend the night with us and there were, well I  believe there were ten of them, anyway they all came in and there was all of  our family and we were literally all over the floor, every spot   (Laughter)  Every spot on the floor was covered with people.  I can   t imagine that.  I can   t either now, I   m sure glad it   s not me. But then the next morning we got  up and brought J.D. to Guymon and he got on the train to go to the service.  That   s a lot of people in one place.  Needless to say whenever it was time to go to town to buy essential things, the  whole family didn   t go to town.  Yeah.  Daddy.  Daddy went to town.  And sometimes one kid got to go.  Yep.  And how did they decide who was going to go?  Well we took turns. One time I went to town and I was supposed to buy a set  of jacks for the kids, for us to play with. This was a big jack rage, and it was  gonna cost a nickel and we had saved up enough money to get it, (Laughs) and  I went to town, we got there and they didn   t have any jacks.  Did you buy something else instead?  No.  No, saved your five cents.  No.  Waited for jacks.  Well what else did you like to play with, jacks and what else?  9  Rawlins  Jackson  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Glover  Jackson  Lemons  Rawlins  Jackson  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Lemons  Rawlins  Jackson  Ogden  Oh we played jacks until     Marbles.  The boys played marbles more than we did.  We played jacks every week.  Well, jump rope, we always played jump rope.  We played cowboys and Indians and my brother made what we called rubber  guns. It was a wooden gun with a clothes pin on the back end that held that  rubber band that was cut out of and old inner tube, tire inner tube, and I got hit  in the eye one time and man I didn   t forget that  (Laughter) We were playing  with Glen Freeman that lived a mile south of us. The boys I think were against  me, I was the Indian. (Laughs)  We played hopscotch a lot.  Hopscotch?  Yeah, we did too.  Were you a champion hopscotcher?  Yeah, we played hopscotch a lot.  We also made those guns.  Yes, we did.  All of us in our family had a gun and those inner tubes out of those cars were  just about this big around. You   d cut it off about this thick and you made your  gun the exact length so that thing pulled tight would shoot. (Laughter)  I remember something else that I used to really enjoy playing that we played a  lot was Annie Over.  How did you play Annie Over? We   ve heard some differences in the rules of  Annie Over.  Half of the people got on one side and half on the other and there were always  enough of us in our family to play without anybody else. (Laughter)  You throw it over the house or the schoolhouse.  We tried to, and you tried to be sneaky about where you   d throw the ball you  know, and sometimes you   d tried to throw it so that it didn   t quite go over, it  would come back, and I don   t remember about the rules especially.  10  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Glover  Lemons  Glover  Jackson  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  If it got all they way over and they didn   t catch it you got a point, if they  caught it you didn   t get a point. So that   s why you tried to throw it     At angles or whatever so that you could miss them, and then of course there   d  be people scattered up and down the side of the house so there would be  somebody wherever the ball came over. (Laughter)  That if you   d throw it real cross like that, way over on the corner and it really  went over, you usually got a point.  Yeah. (Laughs) You didn   t though, after you caught the ball, run around and  try to pelt the other side with the ball?  No, we didn   t.  That   s how somebody taught Steve to play.  We also played kick the can a whole lot.  We played kick the can a lot.  I rode a horse most of the time because I had to go get the mail on my horse. It  was a mile to the mailbox.  Yeah.  I enjoyed meeting the mailman because he always had the news of what was  going on in the community.  The only time I ever rode a horse was with my brother when he   d take me to  school when the weather was bad, or one of the school teachers who he  married but I meant he   d take me because she had to walk through the field  too. So he   d take me so he could visit with her a little bit before school.  (Laughter) They   d take us in the wagon.  We didn   t get to ride horses. Daddy had two plow horses and they were work  animals, they weren   t riding animals, but once in a great while he   d let us ride  them. But one time Berdine was riding the horse and the horse, she liked to  swallow air, or puff her belly out so that when you fasten up the synch it didn   t  get tight enough, and Berdine was riding and the saddle began to slip and it  just slipped all the way over to the side and dumped her off. (Laughs)  Then another time Ina was riding Nig and I was riding Eagle and we were  going down into the pasture to get pecans   we carried those bags of pecans.  Yeah picked up pecans.  Ina got started ahead of me and I yelled,    Wait, Ina, wait     but she didn   t and  when I got on Eagle she went    shhhhhh    and I went flying out into the field.  11  Glover  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Lemons  Jackson  Ogden  Glover  Lemons  Glover  Jackson  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Jackson  Rawlins  Jackson  Lemons  Jackson  Where did they have pecans in this country?  Well this is     It wasn   t here.     after we moved from here.  This is before we moved back to Goodwell.  But then I said I   ll never get on a horse again, and I got right up, got right on  that horse and road home. (Laughter)  Well you mentioned going to get the mail. What other kind of chores were your  responsibility to do?  She was talking about riding. I had to walk to get our mail.  We did too.  I had to gather the eggs, and sometimes had to slop the hogs, not often.  Yeah.  But I didn   t like that job because of that.  We had to carry in water, go get the cattle, so that the people could milk.  We milked the cows every morning before we went to school we had to get up  and milk.  Separate, wash the separator.  Yeah, and get enough wood in for Momma for the cooking for the day,  especially in the winter time for the cooking and the heating.  Be sure our beds were made. I had company the other day and they said     We had to take our bed off the table. (Laughs)        I never catch your bed unmade.    And I said,    No, unless I   m in it you don   t  catch it unmade because I make it when I get up.     A lasting impression.  Well as I said I had a brother that was an invalid and my stepmother would not  let us go to bed unless the house was picked up and the dishes were done and  everything, there wasn   t anything out of place except the beds we slept in.  12  Glover  Jackson  Glover  Rawlins  Jackson  Ogden  Jackson  Glover  Jackson  Rawlins  Jackson  Rawlins  Kite  Ogden  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  I had to help gather the cow chips because we didn   t have wood and so we  burned cow chips in the wintertime.  We had wood and coal but you had to bring that in too, that was one of your  chores.  My dad had to go to Colorado to get coal and they   d try to make a trip up there  about once and year, he and the neighbors to get enough coal for all of us.  When Momma lived down at Range in the Hardesty community and she talks  about   they picked up cow chips all the time   but she talks about herding the  cattle. They had no fences and she said her job, she and her younger brother,  was to herd the cattle everyday when it was time for them to graze. Grandpa  told them they could come home when it was noon and the way they told if it  was noon was if there shadow was straight up, it wasn   t slanted. (Laughs)  They had no time pieces but she said,    We   d watch for the shadow,    but they  took cattle out everyday and grazed them.  Be sure the tanks were full so those cattle could come in and get a drink, and I  think we all had to herd cattle if we had any.  Something that always kind of amazed me on my grandmother and  grandfather   s place was the cistern they had. They had a cistern for water and  you have to fill it up and then you get your water out of the cistern, you didn   t  have a well.  We had a pump on ours.  There weren   t any cisterns in this area.  When I went to we had to pump the water to drink.  We hauled water from the creek until we had a well.  Well we had a windmill too at our home, but there were days when there  wasn   t enough wind so you had to pump it see.  Orwell and I bought the land where Grandpa homesteaded.  Paladuro is your land?  The Paladuro was the creek that ran through it see. Well now Paladuro  Canyon, Amarillo is different than this Paladuro over here.  The Paladuro is the creek that runs down there across the corner of that bed.  There   s no good water on that section?  Right. So their cattle had to be driven to the creek to drink because they never  13  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Glover  Rawlins  Lemons  had a well there.  Because the land was pretty plentiful then.  But I was always kind of amazed by that cistern because I   d never seen one  before and haven   t seen one since.  It   s still there, right there by the house. The sod house is still there.  The sod house is still standing.  Can you see it?  Yeah, it   s covered with cement on the outside but it   s still there. It   s on the  land that we bought.  There   s something that I remember with kind of a chuckle. We had pictures of  that sod house with tumbleweeds growing on top of it. (Laughter)  And Cactus.  Speaking of tumbleweeds, you asked about games we played. When I was a  kid, one Sunday we went to the neighbors and there was a draw down there  about oh, half a mile west of where some of these relatives lived, and there  were two boys. Betty Jean Mulkey and Raymond H. Mulkey, and my brother  J.R. Davison and I ran down there and there   s kind of a little, I don   t know  maybe some boards across to make a little bridge across this gully, but we  were playing right below that and tumbleweeds had blown in there with the  dust storms till it was as high as this ceiling   the tumbleweeds. We decided to  pull those out and build us a house, and we even put a roof on it, and when my  mother found out that   s what we   d been doing, she just had a fit,    What if  they   d caught fire?    and I said,     Well we didn   t have any matches.    But we  built us a house out of tumbleweeds and we played all afternoon with  tumbleweeds. So that   s how kids can make do if they don   t have toys, you can  have a good time.  Yeah, well right where I live right now in Hooker one day, two or three days,  the tumbleweeds blew up, I mean they blew all over because there   d been  nobody got them like we did. They piled our backyard fence full, then they  piled up to the eaves of the house, and then they blew over the house and piled  the front yard full and we couldn   t even get in the side door, and some of my  grandkids came and they said,    Oh Grandma this is such fun, we   ll build some  tunnels     (Laughter) And a whole bunch of men came to get them out and I  said,    You   re gonna ruin the trees with fire,    and they said,    Don   t worry  about the trees,    and sure enough the side of one of my big trees, it ruined it,  but they worked all day one day burning tumbleweeds so that we could get  into the house.  This was fairly recently then?  14  Jackson  Rawlins  Jackson  Rawlins  Ogden  Jackson  Rawlins  Ogden  Jackson  Lemons  Rawlins  Jackson  Glover  Jackson  Glover  Yeah, about last fall one time even.  No, this had been several years ago.  Well we had a bad storm and I remember them blowing down the street just  last     Our house was just located so that it blew right across the field right into our  backyard. We   ve got a tall wooden fence and it just built up back there, and  during the time they were blowing, I got out on the side and I kept kicking  them on by and it filled up the back yard, filled up the front yard, was clear up  to the top of the house. We couldn   t get out that side door at all until   and  when you get ready to get those things out, they   re stacked in there just like a  haystack, I mean they are, I   ve never seen it.  They really are tough. Well can I tell you a story that     You   ve got to use a fork or something like that     But I said,    We don   t have to worry about getting it out we   ll just make us a  path and somebody said,    Yes, and your house, it   ll burn down,    cause those  things are full of oil.  Yeah, they really do burn too.  You can make that burn fast. She was talking about, I was thinking about the  rabbit drives.  Tell us about the rabbit drives.  I   ve seen them too.  We got caught in one up at Tyrone and as I said I had this brother that was the  invalid and we left him home by himself. The dirt come up and I said that my  daddy always prayed but that   s the first time I   d heard him pray out loud that  we could get home. Well when we got home my other brother that lived about  a mile from them had come and closed up the house. But it was just so dirty  that we just had to pull off the road. Of course that wasn   t the only rabbit drive  I was ever to. There was a number of them in our area and they would get out  and walk and have a fence and they   d drive these rabbits up to that fence and  of course the rabbits were plentiful then and they ate them, but you don   t see  very many of them now.  We only ate Cotton Tails; Jack Rabbits were tough.  Well they are tough. (Laughs)  You started to tell us     15  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Kite  Lemons  Rawlins  Kite  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Well I   d like to tell you a story. My mother, our mother is just full of stories,  she just tells many, many tales and I   m really sorry she   s not able to be here  today because she really has lots of tales to tell, but our grandfather was a  preacher. They lived out in the country, but people would come to him  sometimes for different things, different reasons, and she tells a story about a  couple that came in a buggy, because there were no cars at that time. They  came in, drove up in the buggy and they wanted to get married. He went out to  talk to them, stood out to talk to them for quite a while and they sat in the  buggy and talked to him and told him who they were and what their plans were  and what they wanted to do and so on. So he decided it   d be all right to marry  them, so he married them and they drove off and never got down out of that  buggy. (Laughter) I just think that   s so funny.  That was right by the sod house that   s still down there.  Yeah, they just drove up in the yard and then they sat there and talked and he  married them and off they went.  Said he asked them if their folks knew and they said,    Oh yes, our folks  know.    Of course he had no idea whether they did or not but he decided it was  okay to marry them.  Did you find out where the sod house was?  No, I was going to ask about it. Where is the sod house?  You know where Hardesty is?  Yeah.  Okay, you go five miles east on Highway 3, and you turn south and you go  almost four miles south for about four, it might be four and a half or it might  be   I believe it   s four and a half. It   s on the left hand side of that road, and  now it   s a paved road, it used to be muddy muddy     Is that before you get down to the creek where the C.D. Alexander   s place  was?  I think so, I   m not sure.  It was six miles south I remember.  Right, see the Range school was right on past their house, I think a mile and a  half right up on the hill.  I have pictures of it.  Yeah, and the Range school was still down there too.  16  Lemons  Ogden  Rawlins  Kite  Rawlins  Glover  Lemons  Glover  Lemons  Jackson  Ogden  Jackson  What   s the road that you go four and a half miles south on, does it have a  name or a number or anything?  Probably has a number but it   s paved.  Yes, I   m sure it does but it   s exactly five miles east of Hardesty.  On Highway 3.  Yes, and on the left hand side of that road there   s a great big house there, kind  of back from the corner that has a whole bunch of trees and things around it.  This house was the Grave   s house and it was across the road, it was right there  where you turned and this younger couple bought this house and moved it over  there where it is now, and so that corner where you turn, there   s not anything  but there   s a row of trees still there.  I was always at that Grave   s corner; we   d go north to the McBride place. See  the McBride   s were my in-laws, my relatives, and that   s where we had the  most fun at Christmas time.  What did you do at Christmas time there?  Well there were a bunch of kids and we had Santa Claus come. Mr. McBride  was our Santa Claus, and he was a heavy set man and he wore a red stocking  on his head and he carried a gunny sack on his back. It was full of old brown  paper sacks with apples and oranges and nuts and candy for all the kids. That  was the greatest Christmas we had. We didn   t get toys but we all had a treat.  Mrs. Jackson, do you remember any special Christmas   s?  Well there was one that I was thinking about the other day   that was before  Dad had remarried. Of course we didn   t have a lot of money and I had wanted  a little doll buggy, and I didn   t suppose that I   d get it and woke up on  Christmas morning and they had this doll buggy with a big doll in it. I was  always so proud of that, they   d all surprised me. (Laughs)  There were so many of us at Christmas time that we didn   t, Mom and Dad  didn   t even try to give all of us presents, and we were really poor so we   d draw  names and we   d make something for each other. And one special Christmas  that I remember is Daddy got my name and he made me a pair of stilts and we  used to love to play on stilts. We all had, eventually, more or less, we all had  stilts and we   d run around on those things you know, we really liked them.  We always had a big   Dad come out here in 1916 and brought his family and  all of them, my sister and my two brothers and I was the only one born down  here. The Wiggins was his sister, and he had two Mitchell brothers that lived  out there too, and all their families. Being as I had this brother that was the  invalid, they always came to our house for Christmas cause we couldn   t leave  him easily for meals because he could not walk. He was just like a piece of  17  Lemons  Jackson  Glover  Rawlins  Glover  Rawlins  Lemons  Ogden  Lemons  Ogden  Rawlins  lumber. You lifted his feet, why you turned him up on his head so to speak. He  could not move his hands so we   d prop his pillows up and he   d read the papers  by turning his head, chewing on, moving those across the paper and then you   d  turn them over and he   d read the other side do the same way, but he always  kept up. Somebody said to me the other day,    You write so many letters,    and  I said,    Well he dictated them to me so as I grew up writing letters.     Now is this brother older than you or younger than you?  He was the oldest so, yeah; I was seven years younger, the sister.  I remember during the time when we were all poor that we would go to  Hardesty back to that Graves place and go down to McBride   s and where the  Optima Lake is now was a wild sand plum bed. Dean Randalls would come  out to McBride   s and he and I would ride his horses out there and pick plums  off of horses    back because there were so many rattle snakes down in the  bushes. So we   d just stay on the horse and pick the plums and put them in the  sack. Now when I go plum picking I lay a sheet under it and shake it or a tarp  (Laughter) and I get them in a hurry.  I   d like to tell something I remember about Christmas.  We made sand plum jelly.  Like Alma said there were always a bunch of us but one year Momma got  Ina   she   s the oldest   a Tommy doll and it   s a little old tiny doll that looked  like he was whistling, he   s called    Whistling Tommy    and he had a china  head. She got Mable and me, we were the next two, she got us a doll together  which was a fairly tall composition doll, and I don   t know if you know about  the composition stuff but it, after it gets old it cracks and peels. But anyway  and she got Alma a blow up doll, which was kinda like these blow up toys you  have now, and Daddy had find some kind of a little old tree that had thorns all  over it that had some green leaves on it. I don   t know what kinds of a tree it  was or where he found it but he got, brought it in for a Christmas tree. Well  somebody put Alma   s doll in the Christmas tree and guess what happened to  it? (Laughs)  Oh no.  It got punctured.  Well you mentioned before when you were telling that your dad got your name  and made you stilts, what did you make for your siblings or whoever   s name  you got?  I don   t remember that. (Laughs) Do you?  I don   t either.  18  Ogden  Glover  Lemons  Jackson  Glover  Jackson  Lemons  Glover  Lemons  Glover  Rawlins  I don   t know, Momma always helped us, helped each of us when we were  smaller, she   d help us figure out something to make and help us make it so that  we had something to exchange with each other but I don   t remember what  kinds of things we made.  We had little three inch china dolls that were straight up and down, their legs  didn   t move but their arms would move and their hair was sort of curly like  Betty Grable used to wear hers. But I remember they would just fit in a match  box and you could take a piece of material about the size of two postage  stamps and make a dress for that doll and of course you just sewed it on the  sides where you   d cut out a hole for the neck. Anyway that was the kind of  dolls that I played with when I was little. We didn   t have big dolls.  You were going to tell us a story.  You were talking about going to town for groceries or something. My daddy  took load a wheat to Hooker and coming back   course he bought groceries  while he was there   and coming back the lightning struck him and he woke up  hanging over the end of the wagon and the horse, of course, was going on  home. He said he didn   t know how he came out of that, but it knocked him  out.  Then back in the dirty thirties we were talking about that one particular storm.  I was in school, well the night before we   d had it, and it blew dust across until  it piled it up in a fence as high as this table. Then, one time we were at school  at, I went to the old Eureka school which burned in 1935 and it got so bad that  we just did like that, going over the roads to get home that had blown out,  these drifts had blown out in the road.  Like a washboard?  They were deeper than that, I mean they were a foot or some of them were  bigger than that.  What do you remember about the famous Black Sunday in    35?  My daddy was in town at uh the caf  , they called it Odem   s Hamburger Joint,  and it just had light bulbs handing on a cord above the counter where he was  sitting eating a hamburger and he said that it was so black that he couldn   t see  that light bulb one foot above his head. That   s pretty black.  I bet his hamburger didn   t taste very good after that either. (Laughter)  He didn   t mention that, but at that time you could buy a hamburger and a coke  for a dime. Maybe the hamburger was a dime and the coke was a nickel, but  anyway we could go to town on Saturdays and have a hamburger and a drink, I  always had pop a colored pop, red probably     When did they start having pop and lemonade?  19  Glover  Jackson  Glover  Rawlins  Glover  Rawlins  Jackson  Glover  Jackson  Glover  Jackson  Rawlins  Ogden  Glover  Rawlins  Ogden  Lemons  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden     and go to movies for a dime, so that for a quarter we could really have a big  feast.  A quarter wasn   t much more; I mean it was as much then as  15 is today.  Well she asked when they started making pop.  Imogene, can you remember when you didn   t have pop?  I can cause my aunt made us red drinks out of some kind of     Well we never did have it anyway.  A bottle of pop though, when was that?  Well but I was going to tell you, I think I was about eight years old the first  bottle of pop I ever had because before that I   d go over to my Aunt M.L.   s and  she would buy this extract, some kind of flavoring from the Watkins man or  whoever it was that came around. She   d add water out of the well, just as soon  as she   d bring it up and it was cold. That was the first pop I ever had that was  homemade, but then when we   d go to town when I was about eight years old, I  wasn   t, we hadn   t moved to town yet when I got my first bottle of strawberry,  Delaware Punch was my favorite.  Ours was lemonade. They   d buy lemons and make lemonade.  Yes, and we had lemonade on Sundays when I was little.  I don   t remember when we first saw pop.  I don   t remember ever having any when I was a kid.  We didn   t ever have pop when we were kids, ever.  It was about 1932 when I first had one.  Now we had lemonade once in awhile.  Once in awhile we had lemonade.  What was your favorite food?  You should have said what we would eat mostly.  Now that   s a different question, what did you eat mostly?  Beans. Butter beans.  Beans, but I   ll tell you what; we ate so much cornmeal mush and so many  20  Glover  Lemons  Jackson  Glover  Rawlins  Ogden  Glover  Rawlins  Ogden  Glover  Rawlins  Jackson  Ogden  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  brown beans that after I got married, I wouldn   t cook them.  I love them still.  Fried chicken was that a treat?  Well no, that wasn   t really a treat because we raised them and that was what  we used for meat, because Dad raised cattle and he would not let us butcher  them.  But we always had meat and eggs, always.  We had meat and eggs but when Momma butchered the chicken there were  eleven of us, she   d cook one chicken   one chicken.  Yeah, for the whole family, one chicken.  Oh no, no and Dad, we raised the chickens and that   s partially what we raised  them for.  Well that   s all we used ours for but if we ate too many of them there wasn   t  enough.  Then we didn   t have any left.  Well there was just six of us counting a boy who stayed with us to go to  school.  But Momma figured out how to cut it so everybody could get a piece and our  oldest sister always wanted the breast. We always were jealous that she got  more meat than we did.  We could have cut it in two.  But this is something that probably most people never heard of   Berdine liked  the scratchers. (Laughter)  Yeah that was your favorite part to eat?  Yeah, we always cleaned     You skinned them.  You scald them pull the skin off, took their scratchers off, and I still to this day  like the scratchers. (Laughter)  The neck.  And the neck.  21  Kite  Rawlins  Ogden  Kite  Lemons  Rawlins  Kite  Rawlins  Jackson  Glover  Jackson  Rawlins  Kite  Rawlins  Ogden  Glover  Ogden  Rawlins  So you   d eat their feet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You   d eat them?  I   ve never heard that.  My grandmother that lived down here at Range, she always cooked the head  and ate the brain out of it, always.  I didn   t know chickens had brains. (Laughter)  It isn   t very big  My dad always said you cook eggs and brains, you cook them  together   well you use two skillets. You cook them just right and then you  throw the brains out and eat the eggs. (Laughter)  We always had pork because we   d raise hogs. I never will forget one time Dad  told me to go out and water the hogs and they had a hole dug for them and I  went out there and they were laying in this place where the water was and I  poured the water on them and it killed them, so they had to butcher them in the  summertime you see. In the wintertime, of course they   d butcher them and  we   d put them in what you called a smokehouse and cure them.  Well you had lots of good fresh pork that summer didn   t you?  Yes, we had that, and we   d can it too and we canned chicken.  One time Momma sent me out to get the hogs out of the yard, I took a stick  and whacked one of them over the back and he fell. I think he did recover, but  I never have forgotten that, a great big old hog here he goes, thump. (Laughs)  How big was that stick?  Not very big either cause I was a little kid I must not have been over six, but  hit it just right.  This was not when we lived out here in the panhandle, but we lived in one  place where we had guineas; do you know what guineas are?  We had guineas.  We used to have to gather the guinea eggs with a long handle metal spoon  because if we didn   t     They were scalded.  22  Ogden  Glover  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Jackson  Glover  Jackson  Rawlins  Glover  Ogden  Glover  Ogden  Glover  If there was any human scent on it the guineas wouldn   t ever come back to  their nest, they wouldn   t lay there again.  We raised them.  But Momma said something funny the other day, just a couple of days ago that  I didn   t know. She said   we were talking about angel food cake and she said,     Well guinea eggs won   t make angel food cake, you cannot whip guinea  eggs,    whip the egg whites, she said,    They just won   t whip.    She said,    I tried  making angel food cake out of (Laughter) guinea eggs one time and it just  doesn   t work.     We went down, Mable and I went down to gather the guinea eggs one time and  they were way, way out there, they hid their nests everywhere. We went, we  were barefooted as usual, we always went barefoot because we didn   t have  shoes to wear on the farm and Mable got, I got stung by a stinging lizard, if  you   ve ever gotten stung by one     A scorpion.  Yeah a scorpion, and so I was quite a ways from where she was and I started to  the house and I swung back and I yelled,    I got stung, go ahead and hunt the  guinea eggs     and she thought I was saying,    Run Mable run, there   s  something after us     (Laughter) She never did hear me and I didn   t slow down  a drop.  My folks raised turkeys.  Mine did too.  We had them for Thanksgiving time, and we always had a turkey for  Christmas and so on.  Grandma raised turkeys down there at Range at that sod house and I have seen  the coyotes stand right out like that and howl and look right at her and she   d be  yelling and screaming at them and they wouldn   t move a bit. Of course if she  left them where they could, they ate the turkeys.  Daddy raised turkeys and he raised enough in 1927, I think it was, that he  bought a Model-T car.  Wow, he must have had a bunch of turkeys.   300-and-some-odd dollars with his turkey money, that was before the     Crash.  The crash in 1929.  23  Ogden  Jackson  Lemons  Rawlins  Jackson  Ogden  Jackson  Ogden  Glover  Kite  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  See I was born in 1929.  I mean that   s what she raised, and I mean she raised them to eat but we sold  them too.  Yeah.  Grandma sold hers too.  And I can remember them getting up on the chicken house and roosting.  Oh yes, and up in the tree. We had a big old Cottonwood tree. I played in that  tree many a day.  And Momma, my stepmother was so scared of the dark, and he didn   t dare  leave her, and she   d worry about those turkeys but she   d send us out to see  about them instead of her going.  Talking about the turkeys roosting, and of course guineas always roosted in  trees. But Momma, one of the first things that I remember, it   s in my memory  about Momma talking about the dust bowl days is she   d say,    It   d get so dark  that the chickens would go to roost,    they   d go get in the chicken house and go  to roost cause they thought is was night time. It   d be that dark.  That was true.  What did you call the scorpion earlier?  Stinging lizards.  Yeah, that   s what we always, they sting too. Momma, we always bought 100  pounds of sugar that was to last all year and Momma stuck her hand in the  sugar sack one time and one of those things was in there and it stung her right  between her fingers and her whole hand and arm.  I went to bed one night and there was one right up there and I was scared spit  less.  On the ceiling.  I didn   t know, I was afraid to move even.  What would you, how would you treat a sting from a scorpion?  Well Daddy and Momma always used bluing. Bluing is what you put in the  clothes, and the other thing Daddy always used was kerosene, you always  soaked your hand in kerosene or you soaked your foot in kerosene.  If you stepped on a rusty nail you soaked your foot in kerosene.  24  Rawlins  Glover  Rawlins  Glover  Rawlins  Glover  Lemons  Rawlins  Lemons  Glover  Ogden  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Kite  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Glover  Right, we used kerosene; we didn   t have Epson salts probably.  We always had kerosene cause that   s what we burned in our cook stove.  Well that   s what we had in our lamps.  Well we did too.  We didn   t have a cook stove.  But we had a coal oil cook stove, we had a coal oil one.  What were some other home remedies if you got hurt or you had a  stomachache, what would you do?  Well number one, if there was anything wrong with you, you got a laxative.  Yeah.  Castor oil.  You either got Epson salts or castor oil.  Or Castora Segrada.  What   s that?  I don   t know.  I   ve never heard of that.  It   s just a laxative.  Sassafras tea.  Momma used Epson salts lots more than she did castor oil.  Yeah.  What was,    Castora   , what was the name?  Castora Segrado  That sounds like castor oil.  I don   t think so it was, I don   t think so.  Mother always gave the little one   s Castoria and that   s probably from that  same.  25  Rawlins  Lemons  Jackson  Glover  Ogden  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Glover  Rawlins  Ogden  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  But Castoria was for the stomachache.  What about you, what were you guys doing?  I don   t really, we had to take castor oil, I remember, if there was anything but  so far I   ve been fortunate that my health has   I   ve not had to take that kind of  stuff very much.  Well my brother was sick and they put grease on his chest and they   d give us  turpentine and sugar to get the phlegm out of our throat. Daddy would make  hot toddies when he was sick.  The thing that I remember the most is I used to have ear aches just really really  bad, just terrible ear aches. Momma always used   she heated glycerin in a  spoon until it was over the lip, and then poured my ear full of glycerin and  then stuffed with cotton and then wrapped me up in a quilt.  Did it help?  Sat you by the hot fire.  Sat by the hot heater, just trying to sweat it out I guess, but that   s the     Well it did help.  I had what they called growing pains, and my legs would just ache   oh they  would ache  My mother would heat towels   what she did was she   d put an old  iron on top of the stove and get it really hot and she   d wrap it up in a towel and  get it good and warm and then she   d wrap that towel around my legs and wrap  me in a blanket to keep my legs from aching.  We used those at night when our feet were cold.  Yes, you use heating pads now but I have to do the same thing with my little  granddaughter that lives with me.  Is there anything that stands out in your mind that marks when hard times  started in the thirties?  We didn   t, I mean the age I am, I was born in    25.  I was born in    29.  I didn   t know we were having bad times.  Well there are some things I remember.  Well I remember some of the things now. I remember about Daddy   s  insurance.  26  Ogden  Rawlins  Glover  Lemons  Glover  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Jackson  Rawlins  Jackson  Rawlins  I remember the bank going broke.  My dad was a World War I veteran and he had World War I insurance of some  kind   I have no idea how much it was, but I remember that times were so hard  that he cashed in his insurance.  I remember when all of our neighbors started leaving and going to California  and I thought that it was just awful cause I didn   t think we   d ever see them  again. Somebody said,    Well they haven   t even got enough money to get out  there.    I thought well they sure won   t get back. I wasn   t very old but I know. I  probably heard the folks say they was and it really registered I was afraid they  just wouldn   t ever come back.  Did those people come back?  Nope. They came to visit a time or two but they never did move back.  Something I remember is a little more on the trivial side I guess but there were  a lot of kids in our family and we were really, really poor. If we had a penny to  spend for a piece of bubble gum it was a real, real treat. But the thing that I  was going to say that I remember is, Daddy was a pretty proud man and he  didn   t like to take government issued stuff, but when you get to where you  have to feed your family and you don   t have any other way to do it, you do  what you have to do. We wore government issued clothes and they were khaki  colored. Do you remember those things?  I guess I didn   t care.  Oh, I do I just hated those clothes. The skirts that we   d get were an old kind of  a twill material and they really probably weren   t bad clothes but, but they were  all the same color and we had to where those things, I hated those things.  The teenagers today are wearing the khaki print just like that stuff was,  exactly.  Yeah, but they weren   t. It   s not because they   re poor and can   t afford to buy  anything.  No it   s cause they   ve got lots of money. (Laughter)  And they   re spending more on those, but we had flour sack clothes.  We did too. We used all the sacks. (Laughs)  My daddy drew his money out of the bank at Tyrone before it went broke, and  he put it in the cellar and we didn   t know where it was of course, but he   d go  get that when we absolutely had to have it and     Talking about flour sack clothes, there were five girls in our family before  27  Glover  Rawlins  Glover  Jackson  Ogden  Rawlins  Jackson  Glover  Jackson  Glover  Rawlins  Ogden  Glover  Ogden  Rawlins  there was a boy and of course that   s quite a few girls to clothe and Momma  always made our bloomers out of flour sacks.  Sugar sacks.  That   s all we wore.  Those sugar sacks had little tiny flowers and the flour sacks had bigger flowers  and so Mother made my dresses out of flour sacks but the sugar sacks were  used for my panties. (Laughter) Oh they were bloomers.  We were talking about the dirty thirties awhile ago too, we had to hang gunny  sacks over our windows   we   d dampen those and hang them up.  Dirt out, keep some of it out.  Well and wet sheet.  And you had to, when you set your table you had to turn your dishes upside  down to keep from having, eating dirt and so on. After I moved to town  somebody was talking about how bad the dust was and I said,    You need to  have lived out in the country.    (Laughter)  Then you   d know what dust was. (Laughter) I stuffed many, many old socks  and strips of worn out sheets and just rags in the cracks around the window to  keep that dirt out.  Right, sweep those down one day and the next day you had to do it again.  We   d take them out and wet them and put them back so they   d keep the dust  out. It was just like filling it with a mud putty.  I remember one time even after I was married and lived at Hooker that the dust  storm was so bad, so bad that we put wet sheets over all   and we lived in a  new house. We put wet sheets over all the windows and by then we had  electricity and I turned on my sweeper and I went around over the house just in  the air you know picking up. (Laughs)  Well that must have been the same time that it was so bad in Guymon, when I  was living in Guymon. It was so bad that I could see the street light  cattycornered across the street just barely. It was really bad, and then it started  snowing and everything was plastered with mud.  Well that was like in the 50   s wasn   t it. That   s what I thought, that wasn   t back  in the 30   s.  No that wasn   t, no. Hers wasn   t way back then either.  Mine was in the 40   s.  28  Jackson  Kite  Jackson  Glover  Jackson  Glover  Jackson  Glover  Lemons  Glover  Jackson  Lemons  Glover  We hung a gunny sack over this window and a bucket up and let it drip water  so the air would come in would be a little cooler for my brother.  What would you do for your invalid brother during a dust storm?  Well we would just put damp things around and sometimes, I noticed one  person said that they had   but I don   t remember my folks doing that   said  that they took gauze and put mentholatum or Vaseline or something and put  over their face. But I don   t remember us having to do that. He was in a room  where the well was just right off of it and it was on the south side. Most of  those bad storms came from the north at that time.  Yes they did, northwest.  So he didn   t get as much dust in his room, but just protected him as best we  could. Sometimes you   d throw maybe a newspaper over his face so he could  get air.  When those first big black ones rolled in like that we didn   t know whether it  was going to be a tornado or a cyclone or what, and I remember that Mother  and Daddy told us to get in the cellar and as I ran to get in the cellar that gravel  just cut into my legs cause I was barefooted probably too.  Well probably. We never did go to the cellar because of this brother Dad said  it was going to blow him away or it was gonna blow all of us away.  Well we   d go to that cellar and Daddy would take the hoe and shovel and I  think he took a rake too, because it had a longer handle and he could push up  every little while, the little vent up on top where he kinda had a cap on it and  he   d push that up so that he   d know that the top of it, our air vent wasn   t  closed. Because if it had of he   d start digging out that door. Because you never  knew where that dirt was gonna land when it was through and whether we   d be  buried alive or not, so he kept that long handled rake in there for that one  purpose. But he had an ax and a shovel and the rake, maybe the hoe. I don   t  remember all, but I know we always had those tools down in the cellar with us.  Did it ever scare you to go down there when there was a dust storm?  The first two time we were all just terrified we didn   t know what was going to  happen, but after that we were all kind of prepared. Mother kept a lamp down  there and some good Big Little Books and I   d read while the storm was going  on. (Laughs)  I   m thinking that I   m not scared of storms and I know that it was because of  not ever being shoved into the cellar.  Yeah.  Well my brother   s still terrified of storms.  29  Jackson  Glover  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Lemons  Glover  Uh huh, that   s what I said.  But I wasn   t, I thought, well if Daddy was standing out there and watching it  till the very time it hits, I can too, but I was the oldest.  Yeah, this is what I   ve always wondered. Why did Daddy   s think they were  indestructible? (Laughter) We had a bad storm one time and Daddy said,    You  all get to the cellar,    and it did turn out to be a bad storm.  It was a bad one.  And he said,    You get to the cellar,    and he never did come to the cellar and it  blew our shop building away it blew all of our farm tools down into, way  down into the field. It blew everything, and I kept thinking,    Why does Daddy  think he won   t get hurt?    (Laughter) That time we had mattresses outside  because it was so hot and we had them out in the wagon and we were trying to  get the mattresses in and my brother was little and he locked all the screen  doors on the inside and wouldn   t let us in. Finally we got in and then we had to  nail the windows in because they were all about to blow out and we had our  supper on the table and it just turned into a mud puddle but anyway we finally  got to the cellar. We didn   t have Lucy, so there were just seven of us then,  seven kids, but anyway we got to the cellar and Momma said,    Where   s  Margie, where   s Margie she   s not here      She was the younger one then.  So she said to Ina   Ina was the oldest   she said,    You go back into the house  and see if you can find Margie.    So she goes back into the house she finds  Margie sitting in the rocking chair asleep.  Sound asleep. (Laughter)  So she gets her, but by the time we all got to the cellar except Daddy, the  storm was almost over; we spent most of the time   (Laughing)  Getting ready.  The chickens in the yard, it just picked them up and just blew them around  everywhere, most of the little ones were killed.  It was just terrible, I remember that one.  And the dirt was terrible.  Do you remember when it started to rain again after all of these dust storms  and how you and your families reacted to finally see rain?  Well we were just happy, that   s all I can remember. It really was a blessing  because every year Daddy would say,    Well maybe it will rain,    so we   d plant  30  Ogden  Glover  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Lemons  Glover  Rawlins  Glover  Ogden  Glover  Ogden  Rawlins  another crop and it   d just blow it away. I do remember the first year that it was  so bad, we had some carrots in our garden and it covered them up completely,  but probably mid-winter Mother decided one day, well maybe there were still  some of those carrots out there covered up and she went out and dug around  and found them and we had stew. (Laughter) Because she found those carrots  that were covered up.  That was a real treat wasn   t it? (Laughter)  It really was.  This is not a long time ago but just this year, my garden at Hooker, the carrots  got pretty covered up and I dug them and I bet we got, I started to say 20  bushels, but I don   t know. (Laughing)  Well, she   s still got a lot of carrots.  And they were good carrots.  I dug up half a dozen out of my little garden space just the other day.  Well mine   s not been very long but, it was spring break at school, my daughter  came and helped me dig them.  It   s been quite awhile, of course, since the really bad times of course but I  drove for four hours last Friday in that bad storm. I was coming from Santa  Rosa and I was traveling the same direction the storm was, so I never got out  of it. Literally I drove for four hours in that storm, and the dirt was so bad on  my car that it sounded like my car was being sandblasted, it was bad.  How do you think living through the dirty thirties and the depression has  affected who you are now, what kinds of things have endured?  I   ll tell you, right now I   m getting a new carpet at my house and I have a ton of  things I need to get rid of because everything I   ve ever had, I   ve saved   We   re all that way. (Laughs)  Being raised during that time I just can   t part with things that I know are still  good.  Exactly.  And if somebody doesn   t want them, I keep them.  Exactly.  Well Mary Young was my friend at Hooker, she   s the same age as Momma     98   and I bet that she never threw anything away, and people gave her things,  31  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Glover  Rawlins  Glover  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Glover  Ogden  Kite  Jackson  she not only saved what she had but I bet she had 200 margarine cartons.  Oh my gosh.  And the lids and just things like that and somebody says,    Mary what are you  going to do with all those?       I don   t know but one of these days, I   ll need  them     (Laughter)  I   ll tell you something else that it did to me, and I think we   re all probably the  same way. You knew that if something got broken or something bad happened  to it, you were not going to be able to replace it, there was no money to replace  anything so you saved all the little tiny pieces and you glued it back together  and you put it back together and you used what you had because you didn   t  replace things cause you knew there was no money to do it.  Momma still does that     Well I do too   Momma would spend the whole day gluing something together.  Just this morning Jack said,    What   s this board?    He brought in a piece of a  limb it looked like he said,    What is this doing in the house?    and I said,    Well  I think it came with a kit that came from out in Arizona that you build a lamp  with and I just didn   t throw it away cause I thought somebody   d        Somebody   d find a use for it   But he threw it in the trash just this morning.  It   s just like she said, you saved everything and you made everything work.  First off, you didn   t have very many things.  No, and if you threw something away, you didn   t get it replaced and so you  were really, really careful with everything that you had. I still have the little  tiny tea set that I had when I was a child and part of it got broken and it got  glued back together and I still have the glued back together pieces cause  they   re not replaceable.  When I taught school I told my students,    If it   s man made, it can be repaired,  take care of it.     So you save and you fix.  What about your lessons that you carry with you?  Oh, I   m just like the rest of them, I save everything. My kids are beginning to  take some of it because they know that I don   t care. One of the kids found an  32  Ogden  Glover  Jackson  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Glover  Jackson  Ogden  Glover  Lemons  Glover  Ogden  Rawlins  Kite  Glover  Rawlins  Glover  old fashioned churn and so he said,    Mother do you want this?    and I said,     No, go ahead and take it.    I went up to Liberal to the antique shop and I wrote  and told him,    Now you take care of it, because it was just  150.00.     (Laughter) I probably gave  5 for it.  Yeah.  Maybe not that much, maybe not  5.  Well that   s what I say, I don   t remember how much we gave for it.  But like my mother still has the crock churn that she had, but if the dasher got  broken or whatever Daddy   d make a new one, he didn   t get a new churn.  Right.  Many a churn, churns of cream with that dasher.  That   s was another chore we had to do was the churning.  I   ve got what they call a    pie safe    and it   s a 100 years old and everybody that  comes in they just admire it so much. It came from Tennessee way out here  with my folks in 1916.  I have antiques too, but gee wiz, the junk I   ve kept   My grandfather had a mustache cup, that   s something that always fascinated  me was a mustache cup.  What   s a mustache cup?  It has a lip in it so your mustache won   t get wet in your drink.  It has a lip on the edge on it so that     With little holes here so that the stuff strains through but the mustache doesn   t  get in.  So the big thing the dustbowl did with you guys was turn you into pack rats?  You said it.  Well actually during that time and all you didn   t have anything to be a pack rat  with. It   s just in modern days that you got to be a pack rat because we saved  everything that we ever had plus everything that we   ve bought ever since   I have some second cousins that live out in New Mexico that came back here  in about    90 to do some research on genealogy. My dad was still living then  and he took them out north of Texhoma where we were living during the dirty  33  Ogden  Glover  Jackson  Rawlins  Glover  Jackson  Rawlins  Ogden  Glover  Lemons  Rawlins  Lemons  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Jackson  Rawlins  thirties. They went over to where their old half dugout was and they found  some broken dishes, I mean pieces of broken china dishes, and we also found  the brake from the wagon and things like that, but I think probably those girls  were the kind that every little single thing that they could save, a broken dish  or anything, they really thought it was     A marvelous find.  It really was. It was really a marvelous find.  I have trunks and quilts and things like that that are uh.  Quilts? (Laughs)  Quilts, don   t say quilts. (Laughter)  One of my quilts is over a hundred years too.  Yeah, I have several that are my grandmothers that she made before she got  married.  How old is that one that you gave me that Iris had?  My folks made our bedding out of old worn out overalls during rough times  and jeans   I mean they weren   t called jeans then. They called them overalls  and coveralls. But they were denim material and I still think I have and old  comforter that   s made out of old blue jean material, or it was overalls.  How old did you say your quilt was?  Well I have several that my grandmother made before she got married, she got  married in 1896.  Wow.  So I   ve dated them kinda like 1890, 1888, I mean those in that era. I   ve got  several of them. It   s remarkable that even though the times were hard and  things were bad, people that wanted to do quilts kept doing quilts.  Bedding was important.  My grandmother always had a quit in.  She made quilts then instead of   we didn   t have the blankets like they do  today.  But she would write to us after Momma and Daddy were away from her and  she   d say,    I   m out of scraps I don   t have a scrap to make a quilt out of and  Momma would order scraps out of the Sears   Roebuck and Montgomery  34  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Rawlins  Ogden  Jackson  Glover  Rawlins  Jackson  Rawlins  Jackson  Rawlins  Jackson  Ogden  Glover  Jackson  Lemons  Ward and get a bundle for a dime.  Grandma made mostly string quilts; you know what a string quilt is? You cut a  block like this out of whatever you like, old paper or something, and then you  start on the corner     Sears   Roebuck catalogue. (Laughs)  Yeah right, and then sew on one piece and then you put on the next piece and  sew it down and then when you get through you   ve just got all kinds of just  strings, little pieces of scraps. I mean they didn   t throw away anything and  every little tiny piece that was big enough to even sew and edge down was  used as a part of a string quilt block.  Most of hers were done by hand, too.  They were nearly all done by hand, I mean they were pieced by hand, sewn  together by hand, quilted by hand, and she carded the cotton.  By hand.  You ever heard of cards, cotton cards? She carded all that cotton by hand to  make the bats for the quilts.  I have and old treadle sewing machine too.  I want to know, these that she sewed on, how did she sew them together then  this away?  She said, look     Because the paper wouldn   t hold.  If they weren   t long enough to go across this way she sewed them together and  made a strip out of them.  Okay, but you joined the strips as you went?  Yeah, so when she got through the block was finished.  Yeah, okay, yeah right.  If the strip wasn   t long enough she   d just piece them together.  My sister is the quilter at our house.  I used to quilt a lot but mine   s crocheting now. (Laughs)  Well I think that   s all the questions that we have.  35  Ogden  Kite  Rawlins  Ogden  Lemons  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Ogden  Lemons  Did you get enough to do anything?  I think so.  She got lots of junk. (Laughs)  That   s for sure.  We   re information pack rats.  That   s right.  We   ll take it all.  That   s right.  Well it   s really been interesting.  Well I hope that you had a good time; we   re here to have fun.  -------  -------
