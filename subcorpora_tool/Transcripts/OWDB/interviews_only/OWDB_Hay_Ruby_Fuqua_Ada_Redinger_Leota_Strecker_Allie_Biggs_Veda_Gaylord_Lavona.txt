 Kite  Hay  Fuqua  Usually we start out by just stating each person   s name, where you were born,  and when you were born. We   ll go around and do that, and then we   ll start  the general hubbub.  Well, I was born about five miles out of town here. I was born April 17, 1917.  I was about twelve or thirteen years old when the first dust storm came through  that I remember. The reason I remember it is because it was a big, black, what  we thought was a cloud, coming in from the northwest. It scared us. It was  my mother and I; we had some friends there. We all got up and went out and  stood by the cellar door and watched that come in. As it got closer, we  determined that it was dust. I can   t remember whether we went down in the  cellar. It seems like we might have, but I don   t know. Anyway, that big black  storm came in, and it was huge.  Black Sunday?  I guess that   s the way that you would describe it.  I   m Ada Fuqua, and I was born between the big towns of Cestos and Lenora,  December 21, 1918. I lived there all of my life until I got married. The most I  remember of experiencing this was, I think it was the winter after I graduated  in the spring from high school. I had a grandmother that lived at Cestos,  Oklahoma, Grandma Henry. She was in for her health, and my mother went  up to take care of her. That winter, it blew and blew and blew dirt more and  more. On top of that, while she was gone, my dad and my two brothers got the  mumps. One of them would have it for three weeks and then the other one  would take it. They were very sick. The dirt blew in that house    til my brother  laid there, and the first thing I knew, I went in to see about him and he was  literally covered with dirt, his face and everything  laughing   I never will  forget cleaning him up. That   s about the most experience of the dirt that I can  remember, other than I can remember that it would blow one day from the  north, then there   d be a calm day, then the next day it   d come from the south  and blow another day. You   d have one day to get cleaned up before it came in  from another direction. It seems like I was always the one that cleaned the dirt  out. It drifted in something terrible.  5  Kite  Fuqua  Redinger  Strecker  Biggs  Hay  Kite  Fuqua  Hay  Kite  Redinger  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  At least it gave you a day to clean up.  Yeah, then you had to have another day to clean up. It blew terrible. Other  than that I can remember my parents worrying over no money and no crops.  That was a sad part of it all because we were a big family. That   s about the  most I can remember about experiencing difficulties. I knew it was a horrible  winter that winter. My mother finally came home along towards spring from  taking care of my grandmother, and the day she came home, I woke up the  next morning, and my younger sister and I both had the mumps at the same  time.  I   m Leota Redinger. I was born in the western part of Major County on  December 13, 1919.  I   m Allie Strecker. I was born in Indiahoma, Oklahoma on March 15, 1907.  I   m Veda Biggs, and I was born at the home of my happy grandparents back  by Goltry, Oklahoma in February 13, 1914. They wouldn   t leave Mother out  there in the panhandle to have a baby, so grandma took me home with them.  I   m Ruby Hay  Did most of you grow up in a rural atmosphere outside of town?  We didn   t get to town very often.  We were all country girls, I think.  That   s good then; you all have something in common already. So when the  drought came in, it really affected all of you.  Yes, yes, very much.  It was such a big effect. Do you remember when you first recall thinking that  things were bad? Was there something in particular that you remember  thinking was bad?  I do. I was a freshman in high school at Goodwell and one of my brothers was  in college and the other was a senior in high school and Mother bought a little  two-room house and we batched, I kept house for my brothers. In 1929, the  banks closed, then the federal land bank foreclosed on all of the farmers     machinery. Daddy had 18 head of horses. He had sold all of his horses, so he  didn   t have anything to farm with. Those farmers were stuck without anything  to farm with to stop the first dirt coming. Their old tractors that they did have  or some that they could buy from a neighbor or something.  Do you remember when the bank came to get the machinery? Were you there?  I wasn   t there. We each had our own checkbook, and Daddy called us on the  6  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Kite  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Hay  phone and told us not to write anymore checks because the banks had closed.  That was the beginning of hard times for us, because up until then we   d go buy  groceries or fix our shoes or whatever. My brothers dropped out of school,  and I finished up that term with my mother staying with me in that little house.  Then I went to Beaver to school. That   s when the dirt began to move.  So that phone call telling you not to write anymore checks is when you  remember thinking things were bad.  Yes, then we knew that things were bad. Daddy wouldn   t have taken our  checkbooks away for no reason, because he wasn   t that kind of a man.  Do any of you all recall having any similar times?  For the banks closing, I don   t remember, but my grandmother that I told you  took care of my mother, she lost every nickel she had in the Woodward Bank.  I remember that in later years, she got a little dab of that back, but not too  much. I remember my parents worrying about Grandma losing all of the  money that she had, which probably wasn   t much now but it was a lot then.  A little went a long ways.  I don   t remember the amount that she lost, I just remember the folks talking  about Grandmother losing all of her money.  Any amount of lost money is a shame, no matter what the amount. Were there  any changes in your day-to-day life because of the down turn? Were there  things that you ate that were different?  It wasn   t too much in mine. I can   t remember ever having too much.  We had a large family; there were six children and my uncle that lived with us.  This is what I can remember. We didn   t have rain, so we couldn   t have  gardens. My dad could raise cow peas, we called them at that time. There  were red rippers, and they would grow in the dry dirt. Do you remember that?  No, I don   t remember that.  We could have a pot of cowpeas when we got home from school. They were  called cowpeas, but there were several varieties of them. There were red  rippers, they were the easiest to raise. Do you remember that Allie? You  could just keep them.  Did you dry them and eat them?  Oh yes, that   s right. They were dried and then they   d thrash and eat them.  Some of them called them crowder peas, didn   t they?  7  Redinger  Strecker  Kite  Redinger  Strecker  Hay  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Fuqua  Kite  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Crowder, yeah, and black-eyed peas and cream peas.  Some of those black-eyed peas, they were good.  Were they like black-eyed peas?  They were red.  And they were kind of round.  I   ve seen them, but we never did grow them.  We ate a lot of that. We had a farm that had a lot of timber on it. My dad  could cut wood, and he would haul it to the store, and they would trade  groceries for this load of wood. I think a fifty-pound sack of flour was 75  cents, if I remember correctly.  My gosh   So Mother baked bread, she made the best bread. We had fresh bread.  And cowpeas. Cowpeas, to you, kind of symbolize those times.  Yes, I haven   t eaten those for a long time.  Mrs. Biggs, you actually canned Lambsquarters and thistles.  Little Russian thistles, they   re sweet. You can make good greens out of them.  Did they have a flower on them or something? Are they greens when you  canned them?  They were green. We picked them when they were very small. I   d go out  with a basket and get a basket full. It   d make a quarter or two of greens.  It   d cook down so.  Do you all remember canning?  Yes. But Leota talking about the cowpeas, I remember that. We would buy  pinto beans, and you could get the split ones cheaper. I can remember, I  suppose it was a two or three pound bag that we would get for 19 cents. That   s  what we ate most of the time. And then like Leota said, we always had baked  bread, our own bread, and probably butchered a hog, I don   t know.  I can remember that butchering. You didn   t waste any of it.  That   s right.  8  Redinger  Strecker  Redinger  Biggs  Fuqua  Biggs  Kite  Fuqua  Biggs  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Fuqua  Kite  Biggs  Fuqua  Biggs  Fuqua  They made headcheese. They cooked the head.  And the feet.  Of course you split it all up and cleaned the inside, but there was meat on it  and they didn   t throw anything away.  My grandmother always said that she canned everything but the squeal.  You   d take the skin of the pig and rendered that out into lard. You made your  laundry soap out of that.  The kids ate the cracklings.  What would be a special treat for you during those times? What would you  have considered to be a really special treat?  I can remember when my mother would go to town. We didn   t go to town a  lot, and us kids sure didn   t go. My mother would bring home oranges. That  was fresh fruit.  My father brought home bananas. That was our treat.  My uncle worked at a farm, and when he   d come home on Saturday night, he  would always bring us a sack of candy. He   d get a big sack for a nickel.  Was it hard candy?  No, it was just a variety. I don   t remember any special kind.  My husband said that his granddaddy used to come out and see them. I   m not  so sure that that would have been in the dust bowl days, but he   d bring  horehound and licorice home. He   s older than I am. He   d always talk about  his granddad bringing that. It was always those two kinds. They were  probably the cheapest.  We have oranges, candy, bananas, which I   ve never heard of out here before,  being out in this area. Were bananas rare?  Very.  Oranges would keep longer.  I had a family of four brothers, nothing stayed around very long.  I meant in the stores. In the stores, they had no way to keep them cool. I can  remember my mother bringing a sack of oranges. I thought that was pretty  good.  9  Redinger  Kite  Fuqua  Kite  Fuqua  Redinger  Kite  Gaylord  Fuqua  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  It was.  Do you remember the first time that you ate a banana what you thought? I  grew up with bananas all around; I never thought of them as being a treat.  I remember the first ice cream cone I had.  Vanilla?  Yeah. I used to stay down to my grandparents a lot. Not the one that I said  my mother took care of. They   d take me to Vici with them on Saturday. They  had an old Grand Page car. I thought it was so fun to ride in that car. My  Aunt Nancy bought me an ice cream cone. We went in the drug store. I  remember eating it; I can see it. I just remember that story.  It was so good.  Well, we   ve got a new member here, so what everyone did before we started  was say your name, where you were born, and when you were born. If you   d  like to participate, that   s what you do.  I   m Lavona Gaylord. I was born southwest of Bessie in February of    32.  Where were you born, Lavona?  Well, Rudolph Schmidt lived south of town and to the west. Down along the  creek that ran through there, his house was south of the creek. We lived on  what they called the Rayvoln place in the middle of the quarter north of him.  And Dad worked with him. At that time, there was a path from where the  homestead was south to where he crossed that bridge to go to Rudolph   s. That  path came in handy a lot of times when you couldn   t see because of the dirt in  the air. It was the only thing that you could see.  Where   s Bessie?  It   s just south of Clinton, halfway between Clinton and Cordell.  I   d never heard of that town name before.  You don   t know of the big hold up back in    32 that killed a banker?  Well, let   s hear about it.  Mom had all the news clippings. It was her uncle, I think, that did that.  Well, we were just talking about when food was tight and you were eating  cowpeas and Russian thistles. What was a special treat for you?  I don   t remember us having meat. We ate a lot of vegetables in cans that came  10  Kite  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Biggs  Redinger  Fuqua  Hay  through the government programs, but I don   t remember meat.  So any kind of meat would have been a treat.  Roast or anything, yeah. I can only remember roast one time when I was a  child.  You were almost a vegetarian by default.  No I   m not. I corrected that.  We had oranges, bananas, candy     Well I was listening to that, and I remember Dad used to bring home a hand  full of candy, but I don   t remember fruit.  Did you enjoy the candy more, or a big roast?  Oh, the meat.  When it was such a drought and there was no grass in the pastures and no hay  for the cattle, and when President Roosevelt came in, there was a program to  kill the cattle. What   d they pay? Was it  4 apiece?  I forgot, but I remember my parents talking about that.  You could buy could buy a cow for  5 and could have meat, but  5 was a lot.  I remember the Rumsie Ranch. They shot those cows, killed those cows. I  think they would get  4 apiece.  Everybody was killing them.  When they killed the cattle out there, the neighbors were all alerted ahead of  time, because the man who was the head of it was Daddy   s cousin. We knew  the day that they were going to hit the different farms, and those women had  their pressure cookers and jars ready. They   d go from farm to farm and take  out the best meat and bring it to the house for the women to can. They worked  twenty-four hours a day trying to can that meat. Did they do that for yours?  I was little, and I just remembered killing those cows. I don   t remember what  they did with the meat. I don   t think we were supposed to use it. They   d do it  over the hill in a canyon, so that they were away from the road. That was out  south of Beaver, almost to the Derrouzett line. Those women worked hard.  The men would pitch in and cut it up so that we could just put it raw into the  jars. They used it for soup and stews. They fried some up.  It was good.  It was real good.  11  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Gaylord  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Fuqua  Kite  Redinger  Gaylord  Redinger  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Fuqua  Another way they preserved the meat then was they   d fry it down. You   d put  it in a jar and pour hog lard over it, this pork. It would keep for a long time.  You   d put it in big gallon jars in your cellar. You   d put sausage or fried  tenderloin or anything like that, and then you   d pour that hot grease over it to  seal it. You   d cover it and put it in the cellar. When you wanted that, you   d  just go out and dip some of that out. Then you   d have to melt that grease off.  It was good.  Did they use that lard then for pie crusts and things?  You could use it for anything.  What were some of the least anticipated foods that you can remember?  I never did see anything like that, because I was always hungry. We had a  bunch of kids. And there were no leftovers.  You didn   t have a choice like kids do now. You just ate what was there and  that was it.  So you were grateful for whatever food you had.  I remember sometimes we would take a slice of homemade bread and put  sugar and cream on it.  We always raised a large garden and put things away for the winter.  You didn   t do that much when we had the drought though.  Ours happened to be close enough to the well that Dad could siphon off. He  kind of did some irrigating. He always tried to grow enough potatoes to keep  through the winter. When we could talk Mommy into using some of those  potatoes for potato pancakes, you talk about a treat. Everything went into  storage for winter, and when we could get her to use some of those fresh  potatoes for pancakes, we had done something big. They were delicious. I  can   t even make them now.  I   ve tried, and they   re tough. They   re tough to get just right.  They   re hard to make, but she was good at it. So using fresh potatoes was a  treat for us.  We always had a big garden and an orchard because we lived on a bottom.  We always had lots of fruit to can. During those years when the dirt blew and  there was no rain, it didn   t produce too much for a few years. I can remember  that.  12  Redinger  Fuqua  Gaylord  Fuqua  Kite  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Fuqua  Kite  Redinger  Biggs  Fuqua  Biggs  I think we always raised potatoes. I can remember a garden of potatoes.  You could even keep apples. You   d dig a hole and put hay in there and put  apples or potatoes in there.  Turnips.  You   d put the hay over the top.  Outside?  Outside, you   d dig a hole in the ground.  And they   d keep?  Yeah they   d keep. You could dig them out throughout the winter.  We used to wrap our apples in the old Sears and Roebuck catalog. You   d  wrap the apples and pack them in boxes or a basket or something. We   d keep  them in the cellar or basement all winter. Us kids always had apples to take in  our lunch. Then, you   d always take a lunch to school. We always had apples  to take.  I was wanting to get back to something you said about the food that you had  from the government. Then we talked about the cattle-killing program, which  was also the New Deal. How was the    New Deal    or Roosevelt accepted in  your household? Were the kinds of things that he was doing welcomed?  Not too well at my place. They thought that was kind of like welfare, and we  would not take welfare.  One thing my mother did, we had a great big house. We had a front room and  a back parlor. Daddy had bought a big house and moved it up against our two-room  house so that it had an upstairs. Mama put tarpaper on the back parlor  floor. Daddy put some straw or something on that, and she put our chickens in  there, the roosters too. They had eggs, I mean she brought them all in. She  had an incubator, well we had eight incubators in the basement when we were  really working with chickens, but then they just had one that they could hatch  eggs in and have chickens coming on. Daddy had the chicken house sealed up  to put his calves in that he was buying for a dollar a head. Everything was  sealed up with rags with flour paste, all the windows and the doors and  everything, because even the chickens would get dust pneumonia. That was  one reason we didn   t have cattle and things like that growing out there during  that time.  It was worse out there where Veda was than it was in our area.  I worked for my room and board and went to high school and worked as a  nanny for my sophomore, junior, senior year, and then over at Alva to go to  13  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Gaylord  Redinger  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Biggs  Gaylord  Kite  Biggs  Gaylord  college. I was only home during the summer months because I had two little  brothers at home that needed to be fed. My two older brothers worked in the  community around Enid with relatives around there. Our family got split  apart. Up until then, all five of us kids would pile in the old Model-T and have  a dance party out on the lawn.  We were talking about Roosevelt.  Yeah, but see Roosevelt, when all these things happened and the banks closed,  this stopped all that. It was like somebody just shut the door on our lives at  that time. I don   t know how you girls felt, but that   s what I felt as a freshman  in high school.  So you felt like Roosevelt and his activities changed your life.  I just knew it happened. It was Roosevelt; we didn   t discuss politics at home.  It was just a subject that we never were interested in. I don   t remember folks  or anyone talking about it.  Well Lavona, you mentioned that you had government food coming in at some  point.  As young as I was, I just remember that that   s where it came from. I do know  that Dad was paid for work. Then they had a work program that a lot of them  were on around that area.  WPA.  When the farmers could no longer hire help, then that was a job for them. I   ve  never gone back and studied the people that were involved in it, so I don   t  know whether that went along with the WPA job program or whether it was  separate.  But your dad had jobs with the government.  Evidently.  Well my younger brother stopped high school and went into the CCC camp. I  wasn   t home during that time. I worked when I could away from home, also.  What was the CCC?  It was a program for youths.  My brothers built the park at Woodward, that Crystal Beach. That was one of  their programs, because I got to see them. I was living here at Seiling then.  Even though the people didn   t want that program and they still used it; the  food supply was still extremely limited.  14  Kite  Gaylord  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Gaylord  Redinger  Hay  Kite  Hay  Fuqua  Hay  Gaylord  Hay  Redinger  Fuqua  Do you remember what food the government provided?  Oh, I can remember big cans of tomatoes. A lot of times, tomatoes and bread  was all that there was for supper. Vegetables mostly; I don   t remember any  canned meat or fresh fruits.  They had apples. They were beautiful big delicious apples.  From the government?  From the government, commodities.  Is there anything else that they would give you or provide? Jobs, apples,  tomatoes     I just remember those apples that my uncle got.  I think there were some dairy products with it, butter or something that come  through with it once in a while  I don   t remember.  I can remember the WPA, after the dust bowl days, they came along from  house to house. We all had our outside toilets, and they had a form that they   d  fix and they   d put in cement, I don   t think the floor was cement, but the seat  was cement, and put a good lid on it. We used to have two holes and the one  we had was just one, but that was pretty up to date.  The WPA would come through and refurbish your outhouses.  The people that worked on the WPA came through and built them as a project.  Another thing I remember well is the CCC boys. They were the ones that  created Boiling Springs up here and different places.  Yeah they did.  I   ve got a friend that worked with a CCC   that was what he did for a lot of it  until things got better.  I guess I don   t know what all he did do. I thought they worked roads and  bridges and railroad tracks and things like that.  You were pretty young then.  The WPA worked on the roads and bridges, and the CCC boys planted trees  and windbreaks.  Well, I didn   t know they fixed the outhouses.  15  Kite  Fuqua  Kite  Fuqua  Hay  Fuqua  Biggs  Kite  Hay  Gaylord  Biggs  Kite  Fuqua  Kite  Gaylord  Kite  Fuqua  Biggs  Strecker  Fuqua  Yeah, I didn   t know that.  Well, we didn   t at home, but my oldest sister was just married and lived up  there just east of Cestos, right there on the highway. She had one, I remember.  A WPA outhouse?  Uh-huh. Did they pay a little bit for that, or did the boys just get paid because  they were working for the WPA? I don   t think we paid anything.  I don   t remember.  I don   t either.  I think mostly, their paychecks went to their parents. They were given a  stipend for the month, and then the bulk of the money went to the parents.  So you all had outhouses.  Ours was a double hole to begin with. When the WPA came they fixed it.  Why do they need double holes? Who   s going to go with you when you go?  When I was about three-years-old, Daddy built the new house, and he built his  toilet with three holes, because he already had a family of kids and knew  they   d all want to go at once.  Do you remember the first time that you experienced indoor plumbing?  I remember that real well. I wasn   t married before I had indoor toilets. I   ve  been married quite a while too.  Does anyone else have memories of the first time they experienced indoor  plumbing?  Uh-huh, we had moved out to the panhandle at that time, and it was almost  1950 when we moved out there and had our first indoor bathroom. I was  almost out of high school.  What about other indoor luxuries like electricity?  Oh, I remember when we got electricity.  That was a big thing.  That was wonderful.  When we first married we were in a little, Ross always called it a story and a  half, it was two rooms downstairs and two upstairs, but the ceiling sloped  16  Hay  Fuqua  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Redinger  Hay  Biggs  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  down and the windows set right on the floor. While we were living in that,  Ross got a Delco plant and put in lights, which we thought was pretty nice  then. Then REC came in and we got electricity, and that was really nice, that  was something. You could have a refrigerator then, but I had a refrigerator  that ran on kerosene.  I had one off of butane.  Ours ran off of kerosene.  Ours ran off of a wind charger.  Your refrigerator ran on a wind charger?  Well, we didn   t have one. When we moved out to the panhandle Mama had  one. I didn   t think that was fair.  We had a wind charger that kept our radio going.  We did too. When I was a child, we had a Delco and had lights in two or three  rooms.  The one luxury that we had out there in the panhandle was our telephone. Our  community had 15 families on it, and each one had a ring. If you had a fire in  your grass, you just rung a general alarm, and everybody came in and helped  you. If you wanted to have a party on Saturday night, you got on there and  told everybody to tell everybody else to come and that there was going to be  ice cream and cake and lemonade. Then we   d have a party out on the lawn.  We   d dance the grass off with the Miller Boy and all these party games.  Well, you might as well do a general ring in the first place, because if you rang  any one individual, everybody would want to see was going on, so they picked  it up anyway  roar of laughter    There was a lot of listening in going on? But none of you ever did that?  Yes I did.  That   s the only way we could catch up on the gossip.  If you heard your neighbor, their ring going off, would you pick up the phone  real quiet?  You didn   t have to.  You just picked it up and listened. Everybody knew that everybody was  listening in.  One of my neighbors, she and her husband were from England. He put in two  17  Kite  Biggs  Gaylord  Kite  Biggs  Redinger  Gaylord  Strecker  Redinger  Gaylord  telephones, and they hooked up on the line that went north. Ours went south  towards the Texas line and towards Booker, Texas, out in there. If we wanted  to have a big community, we   d have her get on her general alarm and ring her  other telephone. If we had an emergency and had to get something out, we   d  tell her on one phone and she   d go to her other phone and repeat it.  So you could get further away that way.  But they couldn   t be hooked together. They had to be two separate lines.  Well, you didn   t want to get too involved in the conversation, because you  might say something, and then they   d know you were on the line  laughter .  You mentioned parties that you had, was that a common occurrence? What  were they like?  Well, everybody was invited, and even the younger married folks all played  party games with the young people. We   d get our little brothers and sisters  and get them in. If you didn   t have a partner, you   d grab one of the little folks.  Everybody played. On Sunday morning, some mother would stay home with  some help and fix a great big dinner. Then, Model-T   s full of kids, several  Model-T   s would come up, and they   d have dinner and play croquet. I know  one time we came home from church and my two brothers stayed home. My  brother older than me, Lester, his hound dog came around, and she had had  about thirteen pups, and they had gone in and got all my bras and put them on  that hound. I didn   t know whether to get my bras or kill my brothers   laughter   The kids in those Model-T   s were jumping out, and the boys were  just rolling all over the grass. They were just hollering with laughter. I   m still  mad. I made all my underwear then, you know all different prints. They were  all different colors, pink, blue, lavender, and green and here came that dog in  them.  Laughter  Now, that isn   t funny; it still isn   t funny. We had wonderful  sewing schools in those days; it was great.  Our underwear was all made from flour sacks.  I don   t remember ours having socials during our time, because people just  didn   t get out and go. We didn   t have the transportation to do it in the first  place. I can remember Clyde talking about when they lived here that his folks  went over to the Chester Community Building, and that was quite a lively  place. They went over there all of the time. It was just up here at Chester  where Allie lives. I don   t know how big of an area it took in. From how far  around did people come?  Oh, quite a ways.  They came from all around. They had a dance on Saturday night.  Kids from this side?  18  Redinger  Kite  Hay  Fuqua  Strecker  Redinger  Gaylord  Fuqua  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Kite  Hay  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Kite  Redinger  Strecker  Gaylord  Oh yes, even Taloga and Lenora and Waynoka. They came from everywhere.  Local musicians would come there on Saturday night.  Would they come there because the music was so good? What made the  Chester community building so popular?  It was the only entertainment.  I was going to say, you made your own entertainment.  It was just people doing things together that was all to do. Then they got so  wild and got to fighting and shooting, and we finally had to close.  We had some beer joints there, and they had to close them down.  I didn   t know there were beer joints in Chester.  In Chester there were beer joints?  Oh yes, two or three. We had a bootlegger there too.  Let   s hear about the bootlegger.  He lived there about where Paul Daniels lives. He always had his liquor there.  All of the young men knew where it was. Some would also come on Saturday  night and have theirs in different places around the dance.  So bootlegged liquor, was that something that was common?  Pretty common.  Somebody always made it.  About everybody knew where to go get it, I think.  This was before 3.2 beer came in.  Yeah. Do you all remember tasting a little bit of it?  I didn   t.  I didn   t either.  Mom did. I remember Mom talking about it. They were of German descent,  I   m Polish, and they made their own. Mom remembers when they would  make it. She was told to leave it alone once, she was a little bitty thing, and  she didn   t leave it alone. She was really sick. But many, many families made  their own.  19  Kite  Fuqua  Kite  Redinger  Hay  Gaylord  Redinger  Gaylord  Strecker  Fuqua  Strecker  Hay  Strecker  Kite  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Gaylord  So no one here listened in on telephones, and no one tasted bootleg liquor.  I don   t think it was as popular for girls to drink as it is now. Maybe I was  protected.  I thought maybe out of curiosity. I   d like to taste it just to see what it tasted  like.  I have tasted beer. I tasted it and I didn   t like it. One time I was sick, and my  husband didn   t have a bottle of liquor. He thought that a hot toddy would fix  me. So he fixed me one, and evidently it was too much. Everything was so  funny  laughter ; everything he said was funny.  They didn   t always make beer; they also made wine.  And that bottle, you think was bootleg liquor?  Well yes, because there wasn   t any place to buy it. Around there, were only  bootleggers.  I had no idea Chester had any bars.  We had two cafes and two or three filling stations.  I didn   t know those things, because I lived too far from Chester.  We had ball games on Sunday.  You had camp meetings.  Oh yes, Pentecostal meetings.  What else would you do for entertainment besides dances?  Just go visit neighbors. Neighbors visited then.  Neighbors used to visit neighbors.  We used to have a neighbor that lived about a quarter of a mile from us, this  old German couple. They had this one young man. There were five of us girls  and one brother, but he liked to come to our house. He was there about every  night. We played cards, and my dad was a musician. We had a little band.  My little brother played the guitar. We were all taught some musical  instrument. We   d play music and sing.  That was back in the thirties. Sunday afternoons, you didn   t stay home. The  only way you stayed home was if somebody got there before you could leave  to go visit.  20  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Gaylord  Kite  Biggs  Strecker  Redinger  Hay  Strecker  Kite  Fuqua  Kite  Fuqua  Redinger  Biggs  Fuqua  Come home from church with you and eat dinner.  Would they bring food?  No, Mom would fix it.  They weren   t any lights on the vehicles, so they went home before dark.  Would it be like if I didn   t have food enough to eat, I   d go visiting?  People would help then, or they did in our community out there.  We all had enough to eat. It might not be the very best.  No, we had plenty.  A variety.  We always had roast on Sunday. We didn   t have roast during the week, but  we did on Sunday.  What about as a child, this might be more along your line  Mrs. Gaylord   since you were the youngest during this time, but what about favorite toys or  things you remember from your childhood?  I don   t think I ever had anything that was bought in a store.  What would you make then?  My mother used to make dolls. We had a little rural school out there that went  to the eighth grade. That was where our Christmas program was, was up there.  We didn   t have a church right in our community. We   d have that at the  schoolhouse, and I can remember my mother making dolls and balls and things  like that. I can   t, as a child, remember, unless it was clothes, getting anything  that was store bought.  I can remember one time for Christmas, we got a string of beads. That   s it.  I can remember one Christmas, Mother made doll dresses for my dolls. She  put pockets on the dress and put wee little handkerchiefs in each pocket. My  doll dresser was made out of those big matchboxes. She glued four of them  together with the wrapping paper around them and put a shoe button on the  end for a pull, and I had a dresser with some doll clothes in it. That was one of  the happiest Christmases that I remember. The Christmas tree, out there we  didn   t have cedars, my brother brought in a branch, and we wrapped it with  cotton. Then we made chains to decorate.  We always did that. We   d take red and green paper and make a chain. I can  remember when my mother bought some red bells. We   d hang them in the  21  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Strecker  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Gaylord  Redinger  Fuqua  Gaylord  center of the ceiling and then run these chains that we   d make to the corners of  the room. That was our Christmas decorations.  You   re talking about through the thirties?  Yeah.  There were five of us kids, and I don   t remember toys. I just don   t remember  toys.  Yeah, just not having them there.  No. What would we play with? Well, you took two slats. You took one slat  and put a piece across the bottom. Then find the hoop that came off a wheel  somewhere or something. You   d roll that hoop with that slat. I didn   t know  where Dad came up with a couple of wheels one time, but the boys made  themselves a scooter. They found a two-by-four and nailed the wheels on the  side and had something to hold on to. You made your own. But I don   t  remember toys.  We didn   t have toys. We played ball and climbed trees. They used to make  balls out of those socks. You could unravel those socks and make balls.  That   s the way they had a ball to play with.  You had to be pretty ingenious to make that doll dresser out of the match  boxes. That was a pretty neat thing to do.  It was a happy thing. One Christmas, I was not too big, and I went to the  community building and got a doll. It was a rag doll type, but it a buckram  face and didn   t have a back to its head. When we got home, I had to put it  under the tree and go to bed. The next morning when I got up and went down  there, I had a little brother, and my brothers had taken that little chamber pot  and put a chocolate in it and set my doll on it.  So your doll left you a present.  I was furious. I still am.  If you were lucky enough to get a hold of a Sears catalog or something, you  could cut out the men and women in there and have paper dolls. You could  just cut a square off like this and a down like this and fold it down and fold it  up and have a chair. If your paper doll could bend in the middle then they  could sit on the chair. There were a lot of things that you could invent.  You could take the other catalogs out to your WPA.  They didn   t know what toilet tissue was back then.  Yeah, but when you   re the little one, you always got left with the slick pages   22  Kite  Redinger  Hay  Fuqua  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Strecker  Biggs  Gaylord  Fuqua  Kite  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Hay  Redinger  Fuqua  The glossy sheets. What are the other holidays? It sounds like Christmas was  pretty standard, except for the lack of toys. What about the Fourth of July?  They had a celebration at Chester. We lived four and a half miles from  Chester, and we always went to Chester on the Fourth of July. My dad would  give us a quarter to spend. That was a big deal.  A quarter was big money then.  If we did anything on the Fourth of July, the neighbors would get together and  have a picnic at some central place. I don   t remember doing that too many  times.  Chester always had a ballgame. There was a big crowd over there.  Chester seems like a swinging town.  It was, but you ought to see it now. It quit swinging, didn   t it Allie?  It   s still a neat place.  Daddy would gather the cattails up here around Belva when we   d go to visit  grandpa. He   d get the in the fall of the year and save them in the granary  upside down in a can of kerosene. Then we   d light that and have cattail  parades with the five of us children. We didn   t go anywhere and celebrate like  they did. We stayed home mostly, or we might have ice cream and cake or  something like that. That cattail parade was the big thing we looked forward  too.  Well, that would take the place of sparklers.  We didn   t have fireworks.  When did fireworks become a part of the celebration?  I can   t remember the first fireworks I saw.  We didn   t have a Fourth of July celebration at night.  Yeah, right, because we didn   t have fireworks.  You went home before dark.  You   d go home and milk the cows.  You had to gather the eggs.  Feed the pigs.  23  Kite  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Strecker  Fuqua  Strecker  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Fuqua  Kite  Gaylord  Redinger  Kite  What were some other chores that you would have to do around the house?  We did a lot of chores.  We did about everything.  I pulled water out of the cistern or the well and filled the old reservoir on the  wood cook stove and the teakettles and the buckets. You   d carry water until  you were green in the face. Getting kindling to start the fire the next morning  and carry in wood for the next day. And I   d gather the eggs. I did chores all  my life.  We milked cows and sold the cream.  We had a separator. I didn   t milk as much as my older sister.  I never did milk, because I was always afraid of the cows. I could run the  separator though.  Yeah, then you had an old cream separator that you had to turn after you  milked all those cows.  One job that I hated was picking bugs off of the potatoes. Did you do that?  Yeah. Put them in a can of kerosene.  Or they would eat the vine.  They would strip the vines until they wouldn   t have anything to grow the  potatoes if you didn   t get the bugs off them.  Clinton is cotton country. I was nine when we moved away from there, and I  can remember pulling a cotton sack.  Those big long sacks.  I couldn   t fill it as fast as the rest of them did, and they would dump it for me.  I couldn   t pull it very far.  We never did grow cotton. That was one thing I never did do.  Holding that sack, I   ve seen pictures, and that just looks miserable.  It was kind of fun. I would have rather done that. I hated hoeing cotton.  Oh yes, I   ve done that too. They called it chopping cotton.  Mrs. Hay, you   re being awful quiet over there.  24  Gaylord  Hay  Kite  Hay  Fuqua  Hay  Fuqua  Hay  Redinger  Hay  Strecker  Hay  Fuqua  Kite  Redinger  Fuqua  Hay  Fuqua  She is quiet, isn   t she?  Well, I   m listening.  Do you remember what chores you had to do around the house?  Well, to be right honest     She was more protected than the rest of us.  I was the youngest one in the family and had two brothers. They were the  ones that got the wood and did those things. I just did the housework. You  were talking about what you liked, back there in those days. I can remember  what I didn   t like, and we had an awful lot of it, and that was dried apricots. It  seems like we always had dried apricots. It must have been real cheap food.  Mother was always fixing dried apricots.  They   re kind of expensive now.  Real expensive.  We had a lot of wild plums. Everyone canned wild plums.  They made lots of plum butter and plum jam.  It was good.  Grapes. They made grape jam and grape wine.  And current jelly. Wild currents.  My grandma always used to make sand plum jelly.  That   s what these sand plums are. We would can those, and sometimes we   d  eat them.  They were pretty good. You had homemade bread just out of the oven and  butter and a jar of those plums. They went together pretty good. Of course,  you canned them.  Oh, I canned a lot of plums.  After I was married I didn   t. That was one thing that the neighbors in our  community did. Like I said, I grew up between Cestos and Lenore, and the  sand plums were on the river. Two or three of the neighbors would get  together, and we   d take our wagons and tubs and buckets and a picnic lunch,  and we   d go pick plums and have a picnic together. Then we might go  swimming or something in the river, or wherever we were at. We used to go  up on Bryant   s a lot to pick plums, and Watson   s, up in there. Not a lot, but I  25  Kite  Redinger  Fuqua  Hay  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Gaylord  Redinger  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Strecker  Hay  Kite  Redinger  Kite  can remember doing that as a small girl.  One thing that I wanted to get back to was your hot toddy experience. I was  just curious about other forms of medicine or home remedies that you had  experienced.  About the only medicine I can remember when I was little was castor oil. If  you got sick, you took a dose of castor oil.  Castor oil cured everything.  Castor oil or Epsom salt.  When you were a baby, my mother would use castoria.  Yes, that was for colic.  After you got old enough, you   d take castor oil. I can remember my mother  squeezing an orange out and putting that castor oil in the orange juice. It kind  of ruined the orange juice, but it was a little easier to go down.  It wasn   t like the castor oil you can get now; it was bad stuff.  I don   t guess we could afford castor oil. All we ever got was a spoon full of  sugar with three or four drops of kerosene on it.  That was for a cough.  Yeah, it was horrible. When it went down, you knew it was going to help, but  it was bad.  Is kerosene the same as coal oil?  Yes. You always had that, because you had your lamps and stuff.  You always had a lot of medicine.  You had a ready supply, but I don   t remember castor oil.  I don   t think I ever took any castor oil. I don   t remember it.  Allie, you never took any medicine is the reason you didn   t.  Do you remember being sick, but not wanting to tell people?  No. One time, they had scarletina in school. My brother and sister had  scarletina, but when it came to me, it went into a fever. I had scarlet fever.  Scarletina?  26  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Redinger  Kite  Fuqua  Biggs  Fuqua  Hay  It   s a mild form of scarlet fever.  We were quarantined. They came and hung a red rag out on a tree by the road.  We were quarantined, I remembered, that   s when I had my big dose of castor  oil. It didn   t make me well. We had to have the doctor come out. He gave me  a shot, and he had his vaccinating box. It was so neat, and he gave it to me.  Gave you the box.  Gave me the box. I remember, we ran out of some kind of, I don   t even know  what it was that they ran out of. My brother and sister, we didn   t have any  traffic on our road, but they walked around through the pasture to the  neighbors, mowed across the road, and borrowed whatever they needed. You  could borrow from your neighbor back then.  That was common practice back then. If you ran out of something, you   d go  to your neighbors. Castor oil kept your bowels moving, and that was making  you well.  I guess so, if you   re up and running, you   re okay.  During the time I was in high school, taking care of the baby, I didn   t have a  whole lot of time off. They   d play bridge a lot. They gave us permission to  drive the Model-T   s in the runway of the show barns; you know that walkway  that always went down there. Then we   d get out of the dirt, and we could have  our party games down in that driveway. They let us do that as long as we  didn   t do any damage. We didn   t have liquor or cigarettes or drugs. Nobody  was fat. It was very surprising, very seldom did you see a fat student in  school. In the Beaver school, about 40 of us graduated from high school  together that year. Everybody was active.  I bet you saw a lot of skinny people though.  Yes, we walked two miles to school and carried little lunch. When we got  home we   d run and play, so we didn   t have time to get fat.  That   s what I was going to say; you didn   t have time to get fat.  That   s right; I always walked a mile and a half to school. Then when I went to  high school, I had to walk a little over a mile to catch a bus to ride. I was  always the first one on the bus and the last one off because I lived down  between Cestos and Lenora.  Well, I rode horseback. Of course, having brothers we all had horses.  That was another thing kids did, horseback riding.  We had a lot of that.  27  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Strecker  Fuqua  Strecker  Fuqua  Strecker  Redinger  Strecker  Kite  Redinger  Biggs  Kite  Fuqua  Kite  Strecker  Redinger  We always had a pony.  You would have a pony that was for fun?  Well, it wasn   t a workhorse.  Could you ride the workhorses?  Oh yes.  We had a mule that we used to ride. We just played that mule out. When it  would finally stop, we   d all fall off, and we couldn   t get that mule to go  anywhere.  They were known to be stubborn. They were very stubborn animals, mules.  Oh, we wore that old mule out.  My dad had a jackass. He bred it with the neighbor   s horses. I didn   t as much  as my two older sisters rode that old jack. One time my oldest sister was  riding that old mule, and she went off over his head like Allie said. For some  reason or other she was trying to get this old jack, and he bit her in the navel.  We always loved that story about that jack biting Ricky in the navel. He bit  her in the stomach  laughing   I guess he was pretty tame.  Well, you   re not going to print all of this, are you  roaring laughter ?  She   s writing all the time.  We don   t care.  Oh yeah this is all going down.  It   ll be history.  I imagine they had good shivarees too. I mean shivaree was a real event, but  groom usually got thrown in the tank, suit and all.  Tell us about this thing.  You don   t know what a shivaree is, do you?  I heard a little bit about them, but I   m not clear on exactly how they work.  Well, they were real.  When a couple got married, all of the neighbors and friends came in after dark  and surprised them. Then they did all kinds of ornery things.  28  Kite  Biggs  Fuqua  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Fuqua  Hay  Kite  Hay  Kite  Hay  Kite  Hay  Gaylord  Would they wait until the newly weds went off?  And the bride and groom had hard candy and cigars ready to pass out to  everybody. If you didn   t have, that   s usually when the groom got in the tank.  That   s when they got rough. It depended on the temperament of the groom,  what kind of guy he was. If he deserved a little bit harsher punishment, why  he got it.  They banged on anything they could find that   d make a racket and ring  cowbells and things like that. They   d make an ungodly noise. They   d take  sticks and go up and down your house. Oh boy   And then you would let them in?  Well, they really got rowdy.  Did you all have shivarees? Were you all victims?  I was shivareed.  We didn   t.  We did.  Were you expecting it when they came?  Well, I think we had some cigars and a little candy on hand. They treated us  pretty nice. A lot of times they   d take them and put them in the tank. One  time, I was with a group that really was rough on her sister and her husband.  On your sister?  They got a sled. The men picked up the sled. It was her brother-in-law and  her sister. They married brothers and sisters. We   d been over to Chester to  the dance, and a bunch of us decided we   d go shivaree Lewis and Peggy. We  went out there, they lived out in the country about four miles, and the boys  knew where there was a sled. They put poor Peggy and Lewis on that sled and  drug them into town. The road was gravel then. Somewhere along the way,  Peggy fell off. I don   t know whether Lewis did or not, but I know she came  out with a real bad bruise and her leg all scared up from that gravel on the  road. I always felt bad about it. I still feel bad about it. Both of them are gone  now, so it   s just all history.  I don   t think that I   d like that.  No, it was mean. It wasn   t good.  They took them on a short wild ride before they took them home.  29  Hay  Fuqua  Hay  Fuqua  Hay  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Biggs  Kite  Fuqua  Hay  I reckon I wouldn   t have remembered that if it wasn   t for that gravel.  Sixty out here was graveled; it wasn   t paved.  I know it bruised Peggy up pretty bad. I   ve always felt bad about it.  I   d forgot all about that, Ruby.  I remember because the boys had been over at Chester to the dance, and they  had drank a little more than they should have  laughing    How was your shivaree?  Well, my husband and I met going to college over at Alva, so the very last day  of school we decided to get married before I went home. We thought that was  a good idea, so we did. His mother came in that evening to get him just in  time to be for the wedding. We came down, and we found out they were going  to have the shivaree, we went over in the timber and hid out. They were  shivareeing the house, and finally one of the girls, he had eight sisters, she said  they knew where Veda and Clifford are. They came over there in the timber  and brought us back. We came in the house, and they saw Clifford and asked  where somebody was and another girl by the last name of Mary, and they said  he didn   t marry Mary; he married Veda  laughing   I thought it was kind of  funny. I wondered what was gong on. When I went home to my brothers, we  didn   t have a shivaree, they just had a party for us.  Lots of cigar smoking going on.  I thought it was kind of funny that the other girl got shivareed.  Do you remember, as a child, losing friends or relatives when things got a  little difficult because they moved away?  Out there, they would load up everything and go to California.  Do you remember that actually happening, watching people leave?  Oh yes, because they   d come over for Daddy to buy the land. He bought  several quarters of land that way. People just had to have some money to go.  He sent them payments later. They just had things piled on those old cars.  They might even have a crate of chickens on the back.  Does anybody else remember people moving away?  Right in our local community I don   t think we lost any neighbors to California,  but I remember people talking about it.  There were a lot from our neighborhood that went to California. But what I  remember, I was married in 1937. We lived about six or nine miles out in the  30  Fuqua  Hay  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Biggs  country this way. We lived on one quarter of the section, and there was a  house on the other end of the section. We had a family move in there that  came in from over across the river somewhere. They had everything they had  on this old wagon and the poorest old horses I   ve ever seen in my life. They  had some children, and we saw them move down there. They didn   t stay but  two or three years, I don   t know how long they stayed, but I can remember  them moving down, and us watching them go by. And then, I could see them  when they went back. Those poor old skinny horses and that old wagon and  all their stuff on that wagon; we certainly weren   t rich, but we weren   t  anything like that.  There were lots of people like that.  That was the worst I had ever seen in our neighborhood out there.  A lot of people came up from Caddo County from the South. They came over  around us, and would farm cotton for the farmers there. They would cut trees  and build little one-room log cabins. They   d live in that house and farm  cotton. There were a lot of black jack trees on my dad   s farm. He would let  these men cut wood. My dad had a buzz saw, so they   d saw it up and take  their wood to the store and get food. There were several families. Any place  that there was a little shack, someone would move into it.  Would they ever come by your houses looking for food or help?  Well, what I remember is Dad helping them cut up the wood.  I remember that. Someone would move into your area that you knew was  poor. I can remember, we didn   t have too much to eat, but I can remember my  mother taking them eggs and things like that when they   d move in.  I remember one time at school, these cotton farmers came up there. I had an  apple in my lunch, and I was coming home. This old girl said she   d trade me a  milk biscuit for my apple.  A milk biscuit.  I wondered what a milk biscuit was because my mother always made biscuits  with milk. I thought it might be a treat, so I traded  laughing . They   d got  some skim milk from the neighbors and made biscuits with milk. I thought it  must be something great, and I found out it was just a biscuit. And it was a  cold biscuit with nothing on it.  Well, you live and learn I guess.  Yes, well I guess I was dumb.  Our favorite lunch to take school, Mom would make homemade bread in  muffin tins. Then she   d cut the top out and hollow it all out and fill it full of  31  Kite  Strecker  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Gaylord  Hay  Gaylord  Fuqua  Strecker  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Fuqua  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Kite  potato salad. Everybody in school wanted our potato salad. There were four  of us, but you know that was a treat. We wouldn   t trade off.  Do you remember any experiences at your houses with hobos or tramps  coming through looking for work?  Yes, they did at Chester.  And then peddlers would come along in a buggy. If anybody came, you  always invited them to stay for dinner, even if there wasn   t very much. You   d  share what you had.  So these, tramps I guess, you would welcome them into your house?  We didn   t live out on the highway, so they didn   t come out that way.  Well, about any time you went anywhere down the road, it was not uncommon  to see two or three hitchhikers.  There were lots of hobos back in those days.  You didn   t think anything about stopping and picking the up and taking them  up and taking them where they wanted to go. You just did.  You just thought that you were supposed to feed them and help them.  We lived on a highway, and I had a daughter, she was about four-years-old,  and they   d always stop and wait for a truck or somebody to pick them up. I  missed her one day, and she took a chair out there for a hitchhiker to set in  until he got a ride.  I don   t remember this, but did you remember Tom Blands?  I remember the Blands, yes.  Outlaws came to her house and wanted her to cook a meal for them. I think it  was the James crew.  Is that right?  I don   t know what she fixed, but she cooked a meal for them, and they were so  nice. He left her a  20 bill. That was a lot of money back then.  When was that?  Oh, that was back before my time. That was when the outlaws were running  in the country.  Some might say there are still outlaws running around.  32  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Hay  Redinger  Kite  Redinger  Fuqua  Kite  Redinger  Hay  Biggs  There are, there are still outlaws.  What about any other travelers through the country? Sometimes we hear  stories about gypsies.  Yes, there were gypsies. The gypsies came through, and we were always  afraid of them.  We didn   t live on the main highway, but I remember when I was quite small,  Mom got word that the gypsies were coming down our road. She was scared  to death, so of course I got scared. I don   t remember them ever coming to the  house, but I can remember she was severely alarmed because the gypsies were  coming.  I remember coming home from school one time, and there were gypsies  parked along the road there. We had to walk by them. They didn   t bother us,  but we were afraid.  Were they in cars?  No, no, no, wagons and horses. They had all of their wares in covered  wagons.  I remember one time, I think these people were just going through or moving  or something, and they   d come down the road by our place. They would hit  another road that took them into Camargo or on down to Taloga from Lenore.  We lived out on a bottom. We had a row of cottonwood trees on each side of  the road. It was in the spring, and cherries were ripe. Those people stopped  down by the bridge right by our house to eat their evening meal, and my dad  got up in a cherry tree and cut a big limb from up in the top where the cherries  would get the ripest and told me take it down there and give it to those people.  So I took these cherries down and gave them to them, and they were so  grateful that they gave me two cookies. They were bought at the store, so they  weren   t gypsies or hobos or anything. I don   t know who they were or where  they were going. I can remember taking that branch down to those people.  Do you remember any other encounters with the gypsies?  That was the only experience with gypsies I remember was that one time.  I never had many gypsies out here.  I remember my first motion picture. On Saturday they   d go to town to shop,  and they wanted some place for us kids to get out of the way. This old great  big building had some planks on stumps, and we kids would go in there and sit  down and watch a motion picture. We   d spend our Saturday afternoon  watching those black and white pictures. It was cartoons mostly. It got all of  us out of our folk   s hair. We went down there   I don   t remember if we were  still going in the wagon or the surrey, or the Model-T.  33  Kite  Fuqua  Strecker  Fuqua  Kite  Redinger  Hay  Redinger  Gaylord  Hay  Kite  Fuqua  Hay  Kite  Redinger  Fuqua  Gaylord  Kite  One of the questions we ask at the end of all of this is for you to kind of think  back during those times and think of one particular incident or memory that  you have that is the most vivid memory that you have of that time. It could be  a certain event or feeling or smell or sight or sound.  It was that Black Sunday with that dirt rolling over the trees.  Oh, that was awful. I think we all remember that.  That was the worst.  So when you think back to the thirties, that   s the thing that comes to your mind  immediately?  That dust.  I can still see that big old black cloud coming in.  We were all there at the cellar watching. We didn   t know what that was. It  was black dirt.  A lot of times, they looked like a storm cloud they were so black.  This was black. It looked like it was just a big black cloud, black as it could  be.  So that would be the most vivid memory that comes to mind?  Yeah, and then when we just had dirt storms on a regular basis. What I can  remember is that black. I guess it was from Colorado that blew in, because our  soil was redder. That old black stuff would just sift in like face powder it was  so fine. It would just pile up in the windows.  The way I remember it is it would come in from the northwest one day, and it  would be black. Maybe a day or two later it would come in from the  southwest, and it would be red.  It was colorful.  It would be so thick that it would block out the sun.  Yeah, it would.  I don   t remember the black dirt, but I remember the red dirt. Mom would wet  down blankets and put it over the window. By the time it dried, you   d take it  out and shake it, and the clumps would just fall off. Then you   d rewet it and  put it up on the window again.  I know like today, the red dirt around Stillwater, if you get it on your clothes or  34  Gaylord  Kite  Gaylord  Biggs  Kite  something, it doesn   t really come out.  Yeah, she   d dump it in a certain place, and we weren   t allowed to go out there,  because if we got into that red dirt it didn   t wash out. Dad would pick it up  later and take it on out away from the house. It would stain.  Do you remember as these dust storms were coming, whether the animals  acted differently? We always hear about chickens going to roost in the middle  of the day. Do you remember anything about the way your pets or farm  animals acted?  They were restless. Dad always went out and brought the cattle in. They were  usually in the coral when one of those hit. When it really got bad, because  they would wander off. Sometimes it would take weeks to find them and bring  them back. They could just walk over a fence. To try and sort it back out,  they didn   t have time to do it.  One thing, they had to put a chain dragging on vehicles so that they would run,  because of the electricity in those storms. Everybody had a chain that hit the  ground, so they wouldn   t stall out on you.  Yeah, I   ve heard about that. That sounds pretty severe to have to drag chains  around. Well, I think since Mrs. Strecker is antsy to go, we   re going to have to  break it up. That   s about all we have.  -------  -------
