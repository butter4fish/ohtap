Chambreau:

I'm Marylyn Chambreau, Stanford School of Nursing, class of
1962, and I'm speaking with Lucille Orsolini Carley, the class of
1934. The date today is April 5, 1988. Mrs. Carley was born in
Loomis, California, April 25, 1908.

She was an only child.

Lucille, I'd like to ask you a little bit about your mother.

Can

you tell me a little bit about her?
Carley:

My mother was born in France.
not knowing English at all.

She came here from Europe,

She only carried a French-English

dictionary, and learned English that way.

But she was born in

France, as a French peasant, so her particular occupation was to
be of the earth, if I might put it that way. And she was a very
good hamemaker. Mother became a very excellent operator in a
laundry, because she could do the French fluting, and lots of the
laces that most people liked to have done in those days. And so
she had a specialty to offer.
Chambreau:

And your father?

Carley:

My father was the master mechanic of the Southern Pacific
Railroad in California. He was born in California, of
Italian-French parentage.

Chambreau:

What brought you into nursing, to wanting to go to nursing
school?

Carley:

When I was in high school, for some reason I wanted to
become a nurse, and so I took the necessary things like chemistry
and biology.

But I think it went even before that, because being

2

born on a farm, and Mother being of a farming nature, I think I
was close to the caring attitude.
strongly that I wanted to do that.

I believe that I felt very
But my mother was the one who

blocked my desire to go on to nursing right out of high school,
because my folks could not afford to send me to college, although
I had the necessary requirements for college. As a matter of
fact, I know that I could have done very well.
Business College instead.

I went to Heald

She felt as though nursing was not for

me, because she had certain attitudes about nurses. And so I did
follow through, and got a degree from Heald Business College in
Sacramento, and then I went to San Francisco and worked for an
insurance firm, WW&EG Potter[?] to be exact, but they're not even
in existence now.

It was a time when the highest building in San

Francisco was the Russ Building, and that's a twenty-four story
building, as compared to what you see today, when there are
fifty-two stories in some of the buildings. So it was a very
different San Francisco.

But I did enjoy my secretarial work,

but then it came to a point where I left them and went over to
H.S. Crucker[?] Company and worked for one year there. At that
point, I became very disheartened with becoming a full
secretary.
nursing.

So I decided then, I was really going to go into

I was twenty-three years old, and I was living with a

very dear aunt. And she said to me, "New, look, you're
twenty-three years old. Make up your own mind.
nursing if you want to.
mother,"
decision.

You can go into

You don't have to listen to your

she says to me.

So with that, of course, I made my

I never did regret it, although I did go to the French

hospital first, because I spoke French very fluently, and I felt
a little secure knowing that I had something that other people
didn't have, in those days.

I went to see what I needed to do at

the University of California, what was going to be required of
me.

Then I thought I'd go over and see a friend of mine, who was

in the Nursing School in Stanford.

So I went there, and Ruth

said to me, "Lucille, whatever you do, don't go into any school,
unless they have reciprocity all over the United States.
Stanford has that and so does Cal."

She said, "I think: you'll

like Stanford, because Stanford has some very nice women in it,
and also I think you'll enjoy the people, the staff that's
here."

Of course, she had been here a whole year, already, so

she had a good selling point.

So I though, I knew her, and it

was comforting to me to know somebody.
for that reason.

I went into the hospital

I finally got to do what I wanted to do, and I

did enjoy it.
Chambreau:

What was it like when you first started to school there?

Do

you remember your first few days?
Carley:

Well, the first few days were like any new experience.
Remember this is not like the business world, it's a very
different experience, and I had no idea all the details that I
was going to get into.

I felt quite insecure.

But I did my best

not to show that, but it always shows anyway, you know.

time.

You

I didn't know that at that

But, I had a lot of encouragement, from Rita Roland.

Chambreau:

Rita was your friend?

Carley:

Yes. And also, I liked the housemother very much.

She was

4

very comforting.
Chambreau:

What was her name? Alice Friedel?

Carley:

Friedel, Alice Friedel.

Yes. Very, very warm, kindly

person, very understanding. As a matter of fact, when I came
there, I had been taking some voice lessons, and I still liked to
do my little piano work at that point.

So I went to the piano one day, and here I

classmates.

I don't do it now, but I

La-la-la-la-la-la [sings]. You know,

This is one of the fun things about the

I also did it in my bedroom for a short while.

I

guess two or three months is all it lasted, because I got teased
so much about all this work that I decided I wasn't going to do
it any more.

So I quit my lessons.

But anyway, the housemother

was a very tolerant and loving person even with those strange
exercises I was doing.

She was very supportive of what I was

doing.
Chambreau:

Was it a nurses' dorm, then?

Carley:

It was a nurses' home, that's what it was called. We had a
tunnel, you know, between the Stanford hospital and the street
and the home. At midnight when you came home after the 11
o'clock shift, why, you didn't have to get across the street or
have anybody bother you, you see.

So we had that safety.

It was

very nice.
Chambreau:

Was that kind of a rough area of San Francisco?

Carley:

Not as rough as it is new. That Fillmore area new is quite
rough, but then we could go down there 8, 9, 10 o'clock and it
was nothing. We used to go down to have ice cream sometimes, or

something good to drink or eat, so long as we were in by eleven,
or ten-thirty I guess it was.

But, no, it was nice.

Chairibreau:

Now, did you have classes then?

Carley:

Oh, yes. We had three months of probation work.

That three

months period was classes on the physiology, and drugs.

Lots of

techniques. We studied very hard.
Chambreau:

You had to have all your basic sciences, though.

You said

you'd had chemistry and some of those things before you started
school?
Carley:

Oh, just high school level, nothing beyond that.

But they

were taking nurses in at that point, you see, and training them.
I don't think we had the intellectual training that you people
have had to have, because science changed medicine.

You see,

medicine was very different when I was in training than as it is
today. And the techniques for operation were different.
Chambreau:

What about the probation period?

Did that give the students

an opportunity to decide if that was really what they wanted, or
give the school an opportunity to decide if they felt the student
should go on in nursing? Hew was that decided?
Carley:

Well, perhaps both were at play.

There were some students

who decided they did not wish to participate.

You see, in those

days, the nurses were asked to do many, many of the things I'd
feel that the nurse today isn't asked to do because she has other
helpers to do it.

For example, the sterilization, the cleaning

of the bedpans, lots of the male situations had to be taken care
of.
Chambreau:

Male catharizations, for example.

Carley:

Yes, that type of thing.

So that, you knew, for some young

people, it was hard to take that, and maybe here's where I was
very happy to have had farming experience, because my father
would do all kinds of things with the animals, in helping them
get better over some animal disease.
of thing.

Injections, and that type

I don't knew, I didn't mind it.

I think all that farming experience was of value, but I
didn't realize it at the time. A lot of the girls couldn't stand
being in the morgue, for example. The doctors were telling us
all the various parts of the anatomy, the bone structure, the
muscular structure.
Chambreau:

Is that where you had your anatomy classes, was in the
morgue?

Carley:

Well, no, not all of them. No. We had a lot of books and
pictures, but from time to time they would take us down and shew
us different aspects of surgery, for example. They took us down
for surgery to see how muscle is attached to the bone structure,
with the tendons.

That was an interesting thing to me, and then

the nerves. What they look like.

It was wonderful.

I

appreciated that very much.
Chambreau:

All right. Who was the dean of the school at that time?
The dean of the nursing school.

If that comes to mind, you can

mention that.
Carley:

Oh, gosh, I should remember her.

She was very nice to us.

Well, the only one I remember is Grace Ringressy, because she was
our main teacher, you see, and supervisor. We were her flock, I
would like to put it that way.

She saw to it that we managed to

7

knew what we needed to do next. And she also taught us some of
the classes.

She was very helpful to us.

Chambreau:

How long were you in school?

Carley:

Three years.

Chambreau:

And the probation period was hew long?

Carley:

The probation period was three months.

Chambreau:

And then what happened at the end of the probation period.

Carley:

Well, after probation, you were now one of the students.

Chambreau:

Did they have a little ceremony or something?

Carley:

Oh, yes.

1931-34.

It was a little ceremony for those of us who

wanted to stay. They encouraged us.
Chambreau:

Hew many students did not go on, do you remember?

Carley:

We were something like forty-five or fifty students when we
started out.

I don't believe I can give you the actual number of

the graduation class, although I could count the pictures.
Chambreau:

Hew many people left? Would you say half, or a third, or .

Carley:

Well, I would say a good half did.

Chambreau:

They did not go on after the probation period.

Carley:

Some went within a few weeks.
obvious to the girls.

But at the end, it was quite

They had a chance to go on, if they wanted

to. We were all asked if we wanted to go on.
Chambreau:

Was there anybody in particular who was most influential
when you were in nursing school? Would you say that your
housemother, Alice Friedel, was, or were there some other people
that sort of helped you through nursing school, or that you
confided in, or that kind of thing?

8

Carley:

Well, Grace Ringressy, mainly.
always confide in her.

I think Grace.

I could

She was good in giving us advice.

I had

a little problem with my father, who had become alcoholic, and
came to San Francisco, and it was really kind of an
embarrassment, and also a bother to me, when he came, after
having had drinking some. And the housemother realized what the
situation was, and so she would be very kind to him and have him
go sit in the living room, until I could come down, because
sometimes I wasn't ready.

You knew, I had to either dress, or do

something to have him wait, and he'd get a little bit impatient.
But she was very kind to him and always made him wait for me, and
then I'd handle the situation from that point on.
helpful in that kind of way.

She was

Boyfriends, for example.

didn't want to see a boyfriend, . . .

If I

In fact, one of my high

school teachers called on me, and I didn't want to see him, at
all, and I told her. He wrote and said he was going to call on
me.

So I said, "When this gentleman does call, why please tell

him I don't want to see him." And so she had to tell him in a
very graceful way, which she did. He didn't like it very well,
but anyway, he accepted it. Then he wrote me another letter. So
it was things like that. And the boyfriends that I did like, she
cheered them all up to be sure and came again.

[Laughter] She

was so kind.
Chambreau:

Well, that's wonderful. What historical events happened
that affected you? Was there anything particular?

Of course,

was that during the Depression?
Carley:

That was right in the beginning of the tail end of the

Depression.

Depression started about 1929, and I went in there

in '31, so it was right in the middle of it, you see.
you an example of what happened to Stanford.

I'll give

The Depression was

hard on everybody, at that particular time.
Chambreau:

How did you pay for your school?

Carley:

Well, nursing wasn't that expensive. We were given fifteen
dollars a month for the training.
come to?

The training, gee, what did it

Oh, gosh, it was less than a hundred dollars.

Chambreau:

A year, or . . .

Carley:

No, just a fee.

But we had to pay for our own uniforms, and

we had to buy our books. And I had saved enough money from my
business whirl. My mother couldn't afford to give me any money,
and so I did have enough money saved to get iry uniforms and get
my books.

So that was something like $150-60.

But it wasn't

that much, as compared with today.
Chambreau:

For the whole three years?

Carley:

Well, if you needed to have another uniform, you had to go
down and get it made, or go to the office and get one, and pay
extra for it, if something got stained or got ruined in some
way. We had those little emergencies from time to time, when
some new book had to be purchased.

But you were obligated to pay

for it, you know.
Chambreau:

How many hours a week did you spend on the floor?

Carley:

Our classes were in the morning, always in the morning,
during probie time. After probie time, you had a regular shift;
either you were working seven to three, three to eleven, or
eleven to seven. Now you were getting into the routine of full

10

staff nursing, you see, and you each took a turn.
your classes to attend in the afternoon.

You still had

Or if, for example, you

had a three to eleven shift, you then had one or two classes that
might be in the early morning, or vice versa.
eleven to seven, you had to sleep.

If you had the

You either had to have an

alarm, just to get you to the class you were supposed to go on.
So there was always teaching, always the classes that you had to
attend.
Chambreau:

Now did your whole class take all the same classes together?

Carley:

Well, pretty much. We were all together, as probies.

But

after we got our caps, then we had to go according to our shifts,
and whatever classes we had. When I had to be trained in
surgery, I had to have it in the morning.
and do your classes too.

You can't be on duty

If you were in surgery, you had certain

days that you had to be with a doctor in operations, for example,
and that was part of the training. And the same thing with the
obstetrics.

Obstetrics was my specialty, obstetrics and

pediatrics, so I stayed there quite a long time, because that's
what you'd decided you wanted to become, as an RN. That was your
specialty.
Chambreau:

How long were the rotations?

Carley:

I've forgotten, how long. They had a regular system,
through which you had to have pediatrics, medical, etc.

That was

usually at the clinic, where they did all the medical work. And
there was an eye doctor; you had to do eye specialty, you had to
go through all of that.
Chambreau:

You mentioned something about a funny story in surgery.

Carley:

Oh, well, yes.

They always like to tease.

Doctors like to

tease you sometimes, you see. Anyway, I was ordered to come in.
I was on floor duty, and I was ordered to come in to see Dr.
So-and-so, that he wanted me to help hold an arm.
be some breast surgery.

There was to

So they had this arm extended out, and

the anesthesiologist was sitting at my right, and the surgeon was
very busy doing his operation.

He asked me to please hold that

arm down, and they put a weight in the hand.

I had to hold that

hand down, so that there wouldn't be any movement whatever. And
they made it very, very emphatic that there shall be no movement
at all of that arm.

So, of course, I wanted to do the right

thing, and do what was correct, so I sat on this stool. The
anestheologist was over here at my right, and everybody was quite
serious about this whole operation, and then all of a sudden, the
hand started to move. Here I was supposed to hold this hand
quiet. And I was doing everything possible. And I was watching
the doctor and watching the nurse. My eyes were bugged out, and
finally, when the whole arm started to move, I didn't know what
to do, and I almost cried. And the doctor said, "What the hell
are you doing?", you know, real pert to me. And then they all
laughed. Well, "what I found out was that he was moving a
tendon. When you remove the breast, he took his hand, and I
couldn't see what was going on, because I was busy doing my
thing, you know, trying to be co-operative.

Well, anyway, he

moved some tendons which moved the fingers, and of course I
didn't know that that was going to happen, so of course they all
laughed. When they laughed, I understood what was happening.

I

12

was so relieved.
Chambreau:

What about your classmates?

Did you have some special

friends that you were close to in your class?
Carley:

Yes. Mildred Nevin is one of them, this girl here in this
picture.

That's Mildred Nevin. And that's Loretta Pattalochi.

We all graduated together, but she followed more or less the same
footsteps I did, through the pediatrics and obstetrics, also into
private duty nursing.
Chambreau:

Did you go into private duty nursing after graduation?

Carley:

Yes, I went into private duty nursing after graduation,
because that was the thing to do, unless you wanted to remain in
the hospital and do hospital work.

By this time, I could have

been one of the head nurses on one of the floors, but somehow,
something was saying to me, try private duty nurse for a while
and see what that does for you.

So I did that, and I was very

happy that I did, because I learned an awful lot about a lot of
people, in that way, and more privately.
Chambreau:

You got to know individual people?

Carley:

Individual people, and there was something about going into
people's homes or hotels and apartments.

For some reason, I

don't know why, but many, many times I was with well-to-do
people.

I've never known what it was like to have a doorman, or

to have a cook in the kitchen, and somebody waiting the table,
and that's what it was like in these big apartments with these
very well-to-do people there on California Avenue in San
Francisco. So it was nice to meet that level of participation in
society.

I'd never been in anything like that in my life, you

13

see, because we were either farmers or middle class people. We
never owed a penny to anybody, that's one thing my father always
said, "Regardless how poor you are, you never get poor.

You just

don't." He says, "The thing you have to do is don't buy anything
unless you have the money." That was something I learned and it
stood by me very, very well in my life, because I never did get
extravagant for that reason.

But I would say that the private

duty nursing, for me, was a very excellent experience. As a
matter of fact, I was given the privilege to take care of the
gentleman who built the Golden Gate Bridge, J. B. Strauss.

I was

with him for six weeks. He'd had a very serious, well it was a
masculine problem.

But he was very kindly, a very joyful man; he

wrote poetry. He loved to write poetry about his bridges.

So I

was very happy to have that. My aunty and I were among the first
to set foot on the Golden Gate Bridge when it opened.
Chambreau:

Is that right!

Carley:

I still have the little ticket that permitted us to go on
it.

Chambreau:

How special.

How old was he at the time you took care of

him?
Carley:

I don't remember how old.

Chambreau:

When you were in the hospital and nursing school, what was
the doctor/nurse relationship? Was it formal?

Carley:

Like any hospital situation, there's stress in the
profession.

There's bound to be a little impatience or curtness

to some nurses.

But I have found, I would like to say, most of

the doctors were extremely kind to me, and rather patient.

There

14

was only one who, I think, was trying to make me feel
uncomfortable.

Well, I might as well tell about it. This is one

of the funny ones.

I was about to give an enema.

This was the

times when you didn't have the little gadgets to enema with, but
you had to have the can and the long tube and the anal tube, and
so forth. Well, anyway, I was just preparing, getting the woman
put in position and everything, and I needed an order, for the
patient next to her. And Dr. Pettit[?] came in, and he came up
in a big hurry.

I could hear him talking to her.

I knew I

needed that order, so what I needed to do was to get the doctor
right new, because there was no order in the order book. So,
what I did is take the enema can in my hand and run to the door
and say, "Dr. Pettit[?], Dr. Pettit[?]." And he kept right on
walking, didn't even turn around.

So I kept going down the hall,

and now he gets to the elevator.

He says, "What the hell are you

doing with that?" And he's already stepping in the elevator.
And I said, "Dr. Pettit[?], I need to have this order." And,
"This is a hell of a place to be asking for MS." And here was a
stranger standing in the elevator. And all the time, he was very
stern about it all.

I said, "Well Doctor, I need that order."

So we both got out of the elevator, third floor, and he said,
"Well, did you enjoy the ride?" And I was so mad at him. Of
course, he finally gave me the order.

But that was one of the

funny things, you know, that I look back on, but at the time I
was so mad at him I could have taken that whole thing and hit him
with it.
So we had some fun things.

I'd say generally, the doctors

15

were very good to me.

In fact, I was able to deliver two babies

in San Francisco, because of a doctor who permitted me to do
that.
Chambreau:

That's because I was a graduate by this time.

That's great.

The medical school was there at the time, so

you had interns and medical students and all of that, so the
medical students were wanting to do a lot, also, right?
Carley:

Oh, yes.

Chambreau:

Did you have private doctors who came in also, from San
Francisco?

Carley:

Yes.

Chambreau:

So it was the private doctors who allowed you to do some
special type things.

Carley:

Oh, very definitely.

Of course, by this time, once you get

your cap, and you're a graduate, now you are really responsible,
so you have many privileges, sometimes.
Chambreau:

When you were working, did you have a head nurse on the
floor?

Carley:

Yes, we had a head nurse on the floor, and we also had one
who was training to be a head nurse. We had a lot of good
training that way.

Chambreau:

So you had quite a few people helping you.

Do you remember

what you got an hour, what your pay was when you first graduated?
Carley:

Yes.

I can tell you.

One dollar per hour. We got eight

dollars for eight hours of private duty work.
something else.

The hospital was

I think they gave a little more, probably.

I

don't remember, because I didn't stay in the hospital too long.
Chambreau:

We could talk about some of the things that you thought were

16

the good things about nursing school, the strengths of the
curriculum, some of the things you thought you needed more help
with. When you became a nurse, what were some of the things that
you felt like you really felt good about, and were there some
things that you wished you'd had a little more training about?
Carley:

I loved children, and I think I could have remained in
pediatrics.

I don't know why they took us out, but they took a

group of us out of pediatrics into obstetrics.

We were getting a

flood of people who needed delivery, and I'd already had my
obstetrics, but I was kind of glad.

That's when I did this

delivery of two children, under Dr. Smith, in the Italian
district.

There you had to do the beds, have the supplies,

aseptic delivery, not a sterile delivery.
Chambreau:

Where was the delivery?

Carley:

In homes.

Chambreau:

It was in people's homes. How wonderful.

Carley:

Well, it was a fun thing for me, because it was a great
experience to be able to handle that tummy and manipulate the
baby so it'd come out all right. Of course you have your gloves
on and all of that.

Chambreau:

Did they have nurse midwives at that time at all?

Carley:

Oh, yes, there were some, but they were never hired by the
hospital.

Chambreau:

So that didn't occur to you, to do that?

Carley:

No.

But it was one of my dreams.

I was going to be one of

these midwives who went to the Kentucky Mountains on horseback
and delivered the babies in mountain areas.

That was one of my

17

dreams.

I was going to go up to Washington state and get a

degree, but the good Lord had something else in mind for me, so
he put me in the right place at the right time to meet such a
wonderful husband.
Chambreau:

I just wanted to ask you, did you take state board
examinations then?

Carley:

Yes.

Chambreau:

Do you remember anything about that?

Carley:

Oh, it was the biggest trial I'd ever had.

Chambreau:

Is that right?

Carley:

We had to study so hard for that.

Chambreau:

And then how long was the test? Where did you go for it?

Carley:

We had a state board room, someplace, I don't remember.

Chambreau:

In San Francisco?

Carley:

In San Francisco, yes. We had to take our state boards.

It was a whole morning, as I remember our being

Some had to come in the afternoon.

You were scheduled a

certain time, you see, to come.
Chambreau:

Now, was it an oral test, or was it all written?

Carley:

You had both oral and written.

Chambreau:

What was the oral part like?

Carley:

Yes.

I don't remember having to demonstrate anything.

Chambreau:

Did you have a graduation ceremony?

Carley:

Yes, we had a graduation ceremony.

It

18

Chambreau:

And was that with the medical school or was that just by
yourselves?

Carley:

No, just by ourselves.

Sorry I don't have a picture of

that.
Chambreau:

Do you remember anything about that? Was there a lot of
emotion attached to that? Was it a happy time?

Carley:

For me, I was glad to have it finished.

I was tired by this

time, I think. Nursing was not easy during that Depression
time.

I just want to share one thing with you that I think would

shock those of you who threw thermometers away and bandages away
and so forth.

In those days, we never did anything like that.

We had everything sterilized.

But the thing I wanted to share

was that at a time in '33, it was hard to find bandages.
Hospitals were having a hard time finding the material, the
cotton and so forth, for the bandages. All the work that was
ever done on a patient, even if the bandage had pus on it or
blood on it or anything, was put in a container, and that
container, then, had to be sent up to surgery. We had a special
room for this, and those of us, of course, who had to go through
the training, did that as part of our surgery work.

You had to

wear gloves and masks, because there was so much contamination
from those bandages. All bandages were saved.

the young nurses to do that kind of thing.

So we had to clean

off the tape that was put on them, and then throw the bandage in
some very strong soap. You'd soak it in that for twelve hours,

and the next morning you'd take those out and they'd have to go
in to a laundromat, and they'd be washed off in the laundromat.
After the laundromat, then they're taken out and we'd take them
and press them out, by hand, and then fold them.

They had to be

It depends upon the size of the bandage.

After which they were autoclaved.

You put ten or twelve, in a

package, and they were wrapped a certain way, very specially, and
then all autoclaved and sterilized again.

The process was long,

but that was the way to keep a bandage for a whole year. We
couldn't buy anything.
Chambreau:

What do you remember about taking the needles and the
syringes and that sort of thing.

Carley:

Well, that all had to be sterilized.

Everything was

sterilized.
Chambreau:

Did you have to sharpen the needles?

Carley:

No, I don't remember having to sharpen the needles.

Chambreau:

I just wondered if you had to check something.

Carley:

But sterilize them, yes. All the instruments.

Everything

was sterilized. We'd sterilize tubes and things of that sort.
Chambreau:

Did you do any graduate work, any more studying after
graduation?

Carley:

No.

I was with a friend of mine.

Chambreau:

You were living in San Francisco then?

Carley:

I was living in San Francisco.

I decided, since I had

business education, that perhaps what I'd like to do is be an
office nurse, because I'd had business training, you see.

20

Several girls who had done that had found it very rewarding to
themselves.

I was almost twenty-five, and I was eager to have a

mate, of course, but having a little hard time finding the right
person, and I was very self-involved.

I had my mother to think

about. My father had died by this time, because while I was in
training he had tuberculosis.

I had to go up to Weimar some

times and take care of him up there, so he was kind of a heavy
weight in my latter training days.

But anyway, that's all an

On Monday

Yes, it was fine with

Friday I was interviewed to take an office nursing job in

Palo Alto. So I took it, and Dr. Lundquist said to me on Friday,
"Can you be there Monday morning at 9 o'clock?"

I said, "Oh yes,

doctor." Well, I didn't knew, I had no place to live, I didn't
knew anybody in Palo Alto.

I had an acquaintance that I knew.

So I called her and asked her if I could just stay there one
night, because I didn't want to stay at a hotel, because I'd had
one little experience that frightened me a little bit when I took
care of a patient in a hotel, the St. Francis hotel in San
Francisco.

She says, "Sure." I had to leave my clothes in my

apartment.

I went to the newspapers and also to her and she said

that many people put signs on doors, or in the little Gazette
newspaper in Palo Alto at that time.
where I could find a room to rent.

So I looked at it to see

I didn't want to get an

apartment yet, because I didn't knew Palo Alto enough, and I
wanted to get into a right location so I didn't have to go too
far.

I had no car so I either had to take a bus or walk to my

21

work.

There was a home just about four blocks away fromrayplace

of employment, where Dr. Lundquist had his office.
Chambreau:

What street was that on?

Carley:

His office was on Webster Street at Hamilton. A big white
house? it's still there.

It's up on the third floor of the

building . Well, anyway, I wanted to be within four or five
blocks of that place.

So this woman had a "Rooms for Rent" on

the pillar of her front porch.

This was on Cowper at University

I walked over there and rang that doorbell, and the lady

said, "No, I've got two rooms, but I cannot let you have them
because of the young men who are in the floors upstairs.

But if

you don't get anything by tomorrow, please do come back, because
if you don't mind sleeping on a folding bed in my living room,
and I have also a commode to hang your lovely uniforms and cap,
I'll be very glad to keep you as long as you can find a place."
And so I thought, oh, isn't she nice.

But I still looked

I thought, well, maybe I better be independent and see

if I can find a little room someplace.

She was also taking care of her

I said yes, so I met him. Well, of course, I

didn't think much of him. He was a nice guy and all of that, but
I didn't say, "Oh, that's it!" or anything of that sort.
I found myself a little apartment, and two or three weeks

22

later, I get a telephone call, "Would I like to go to the
beach?"

I worked for Dr. Lundquist about a year, after which I

came back and did more private duty nursing.

I was at Stanford

then another four or five months with the private duty nursing.
Leon busied the highways and the telephone trying to urge me to
be engaged.

By this time I was with Judy Revetta[?], who was

also a Stanford nurse, and we were rooming together in this
apartment.

So she said, "Well, I'm having trouble with my

boyfriend too.

You knew what we ought to do. We ought to take a

trip to Cuba."

I said, "Oh, let's do!"

Of course, Castro wasn't

dominating the country then.
We went on this trip to Cuba together, to determine whether
she was going to marry her man or whether I should become engaged
to Leon.

The romantic part of it was, that he had given the

purser three letters to give me every other day, and the purser
made me believe that the mailbag was hung on the buoy, out on the
ocean somewhere, and at midnight they collected the mail, and
that's hew I got the mail, because I kept saying, "Well, hew did
these letters get here?" And nobody would ever tell me.
[Laughter]

It was quite a romantic affair. We finally got

married and we had our little three children.
Chambreau:

Did Leon stay in Palo Alto, then?

Carley:

Yes, he stayed in Palo Alto. We were married in Palo Alto.

Chambreau:

When you worked at Stanford, you were actually working at
the old Palo Alto hospital?

Carley:

Yes, the old Hoover hospital.

I went back there during the

very well with my little girl.

I was doing night duty, which was

the only time they wanted me, and I was finding it a little bit
hard to hear my daughter down there whimpering.
mother, always a mother, I guess.

You know, once a

I worked about six to eight

months, and then I couldn't take it any more, it was too much.

I

couldn't take care of the baby and do nursing too, so that was
the last of my official nursing.
Chambreau:

And that was in 1942 or . . .?

Carley:

Yes, about '42.

Chambreau:

After that, then you raised your family, were living in Palo
Alto at the time?

Carley:

Yes.

Now, I don't do very much nursing, except when I have

friends who want me to help them after a patient comes home from
the hospital, or something of this sort.

I always say—I don't

know how you feel about the issue of God or let's say life, if
you want to put it that way—but I always feel that there is
always something, just like my nursing profession. What is it
that urges you, something you can't resist, you have to do what
you're impelled to do inside.

It's finally the thing that

illuminates you or gives you meaning for life.

Fortunately, I,

number one, married Leon. Number two, he knows a professor at
Stanford, who's a professor of law, who is now in the field of
religion.

I was a Catholic, my husband was a Congregationalist,

and we were very different in our points of view. However, we
weren't going to make that inhibit our marriage in any way,
because we had already talked about that before our marriage.

So

Harry comes along, Harry Rathman[?], and he offered us the
opportunity to study the teachings of Jesus, as it is in the
Bible, in their living room. Well, here I was among all these
highly educated people.

But I didn't classify that as like having a

I did not have a degree, except my

I wanted to do that, but my folks couldn't

I have a certificate in nursing, but it's known as a

degree, a nursing degree, a legal nursing degree.

It was the

highest form of nursing.
Chambreau:

But not a bachelor of science.

Carley:

No, because after that, in the fifties, you girls or whoever
it was, decided you had to have more education, formal education,
which was all very nice.

Chambreau:

And that was when the bachelor's degree came in?

Carley:

That's when the bachelor's degree came in, that's right.
But I didn't go for that, because Leon and I were very much
involved in this thing called Creative Initiative Foundation, you
see. We were engrossed by this

[END OF SIDE A]

[BEGINNING OF SIDE B]

small group that started the Creative Initiative
Foundation. We did not do any teaching.

Harry Rathman[?] did

the teaching. We were still in the process of learning.

It was

Henry Burton Sharman, who was really the creator of the books

that we used, you see. He was a man of high intellect, an
English person from Canada. He learned Aramaic, Greek, and
Latin, in order to interpret the most extant materials that are
in existence today. He made enough money to retire for the rest
of his life in a matter of five years. He was a devoted man, to
realize that the Bible still had something to give to humanity.
He wanted to take the superimposition of early Christianity away
from it and just bring out this great mind, this Jewish mind, a
wonderful spirit, in teaching mankind hew to live with himself,
primarily.
with God.
Chambreau:

Number two, to live with others, and then to live
Or maybe it should be the other way around.

So, in a way, this was a different way of looking at the
Bible?

Carley:

The only way he had was to ask you questions.

in every one of those parables.

You find the

There's only one basic truth

Truth is big, it's vast, it's

out of the imagination, almost, it's so exciting.
Chambreau:

Then, hew did CIF change to became Beyond War? What
happened?

Carley:

When we saw what Dr. Sharman was doing, and what Harry had
done, we began to realize that we had to do something in a big
way.

Now we began to ask for people who had potential

leadership.

So now, we got many more. We were very choosy. We

began to grow in leadership, because you can't do a thing unless
you have leadership if you're going to do something big. You
have to have people who are devoted, who are totally committed,
and who will be able to communicate to others in a way that they

26

can learn, and live it. From that, now what was that question
again you asked?
CIF, from about '46, had all those years until 1980.

So CIF

became a national foundation first. Oh, we had I don't know how
many different names.
truth was the same.

But the principles were the same, the

the same and always will be.

It is

But however, our process of

learning had to change, of teaching, you see. We had to realize
where we were.

By this time now we had four lodges built, and

each lodge had I guess it was six or eight cottages, because
there was only two people allowed in a cottage, either a couple
or two females or two males in each cottage.

You'd go to your

particular lodge. We had four seminars going at the same time,
with leadership and co-leaders.

Co-leaders were the ones that

were being trained to become leaders later.
every week in Ben Lomond from about 1948.

So this was going on

The movement of the

world was changing again, and so we were trying to hasten it,
trying to get more and more people to participate. Well, they
did. A lot of people participated.

Some people got something

from us, other people couldn't take it. They were not ready for
it, not really.

I think in Beyond War, we begin to see that

there are too many wars going on. There were something like
fifty-three different wars, here and there, all over the world,
and we were beginning to ask, vhy do we keep repeating the same
error generation after generation after generation for
centuries?

We've got to stop wars, we've got to see that wars

are obsolete, now that we've got the nuclear bomb.

It was the

27

nuclear setup that made us realize more and more that we just had
to do something and do it fast, so we said, "Put the books away.
Ship 'em away." And we've got them in storage.

"Let's not do

that. We have to now have a new curriculum, completely new
curriculum." So those who were in charge decided to either sell
their homes or rent their homes, and then they were assigned
certain states all over the United States, had already made
contact with necessary people. We had administrators who had run
businesses and they knew how to manage all that.

I would not be

the type, neither would Leon.
Chambreau:

So, what you did then to get this information out was people
would volunteer.

The leaders would go to different states to

start their own Beyond War initiative and educate people in
different states.
Carley:

That's correct. We did a lot of printing, a lot of writing.

Chambreau:

Now, this was in 1980?

Carley:

Yes, 1980 is when the Beyond War movement began.

By 1981,

we were now administering leadership in various states, and from
this point on they're out there, all working in various states.
Chambreau:

and all over the world.

Carley:

Yes, oh yes. Richard's over in Russia right now, Richard
Rathman.

Chambreau:

Is he?

Carley:

Yes, he and a group.

Because they have to keep in touch,

they always have to keep in touch.

There's always a group that's

over there, trying to influence them, and trying also to psych
out what's going on.

28

Chambreau:

I do have a question that I'd love to ask you.

It sounds

like you took on a very large undertaking: organizing all these
people, getting leaders, this whole thing. How did it affect
your life, your married life and your family life?
Carley:

Well, by this time—Mr. Carley now is in his seventies and I
am too.

Chambreau:

And your children have grown?

Carley:

And they're grown, that's right.

Chambreau:

But I'm thinking about earlier.

Did it require a lot of

your time?
Carley:

Oh, a hundred percent time, yes. My daughter took it very
nicely. My son had a little more of a problem with it.
time we were taking on more responsibility also.

By this

Of course, I

had an aunt who could come and stay with my children, so I had no
problem that way, but I spent a lot of time with people.

I took

trips down to Los Angeles and taught down there for, oh, six
months.

I'd go every Wednesday and every Thursday, took the

plane down, came back at 5 o'clock, cooked dinner at home, like a
businesswoman.
Chambreau:

So that was your professional life?

Carley:

That was my professional life, that's correct.

Chambreau:

And you actually were teaching classes and courses?

Carley:

That's right. As a matter, I did some of it by letter to
different people.

I've got a dentist in North Carolina who still

thinks I'm about the world's most wonderful person, because I did
so many things to help them in their marriage.
Chambreau:

So you did counseling.

29

Carley:

Oh, yes, lots of it. But those were just privileges, just
God-given privileges.

Chambreau:

And how would you say that your nursing background had tied
into this?

Carley:

I think the nursing background, getting to knew people,
getting to not be afraid of people tied into it.
wonderful.

People are

They're the instruments of the joys of life, even

though they make problems, you know.
Chambreau:

We make problems for ourselves.

Carley:

Well we all do, but then that's again in that category of
ignorance, or self-will.

One or the other.

I think it's an

exciting life, to get into that, to know yourself and to know
that you're just exactly like everybody else. There's nothing so
unique.
ability.
Chambreau:

The only thing that's unique is your particular creative
That's the only thing that's unique.

And you were saying that your son, he had trouble with the
fact that you were gone at certain times.

Carley:

Well, that was during his teenage years when I should have
been home more. He was there with his boy friends, drinking.

Of

course, by this time he was in the automobile, learning how to
drive. He went to the libraries, and I don't know where he had
got some of these books.

He spent his money on buying these

automotive books, on learning how to repair automobiles.

So by

the time he was fourteen, fifteen, he wanted what he called an
old clunk, meaning an old, dilapidated car.

So we let him buy

one for fifty-five dollars or something of this sort. We parked
our car on the street to keep his old clunk in our driveway so he

30

could work on it.

Bat anyway, the thing we didn't like was that

he would get beer.

The boys had beer, and we didn't like him to

have beer at sixteen.
Chambreau:

Sounds like things haven't changed.

Carley:

Oh, no, dear.

The human process is the same. He said,

"Mom, if the dope was around, I guess I'd have been in that, too,
wouldn't I?" And I said, "I guess you would have, honey."
Chambreau:

Well, this has just been such a pleasure talking with you,
Lucille.

I was wondering, are there any other things that you'd

like to just add, comments about nursing today, or about just any
other things about your life that you would like to add?
Carley:

Nursing is indeed a most beautiful profession.

It's a very

needed profession, and I guess what I feel is that the personal
contact with people is so vital, so important.

I feel that we've

became very technological in nursing, and in some strange way,
though the registered nurse today is well-educated, there's
something that must be learned in the nursing profession, a
little bit more of a return to the patient. Maybe we can't do it
because medicine has technologically changed, in that we don't
keep patients in the hospitals as long as we used to, so we had
the chance to nurture them a little bit more.

But I think we

learn an awful lot about humanity by knowing people a bit more.
Private duty nursing was an important thing for me in that realm,
and I really thank them for that, for having that kind of
profession.

I think we can over-educate ourselves.

I know we

have to keep up with the times, keep up with the developments in
medicine, in pharmaceutical work, and so forth.

But I think

31

there is a need to learn more about the who am I, where am I, and
where am I going thing in the profession.
Chambreau:

So maybe what we've done is exchange the more psychological
support for the more physical support, because hospital nursing,
critical care, has become so technical.

Ihe need for nurturing

has been . . .
Carley:

. . . set aside.

Chambreau:

Set aside for other areas, perhaps, other people, social
workers or some other profession.

Nursing is doing more of the

physical nurturing and hopefully there's some mental/emotional
nurturing in there, too.
Well, thank you again.
Carley:

But there is not as much time for it.

It's been a real treat.

Well, it's been a real joy, a joy.
