Hedenkairp:

This is Ellie Hedenkairp speaking, and I'm interviewing Jane
Gillingham and Marilyn Blake from the class of 1948. Maybe when
you speak you can mention your names once or twice so that we'll
know which one of the two of you is speaking. But the first
question we'd like to talk about is What were your motivations
to became a nurse? Jane, can you remember?

Gillingham:

Nothing very esoteric, I'll tell you that. No, it was just
something I had always planned to do; I really had no other plan
in my life. That's what I'd always thought I'd do.

Blake:

My father was instrumental in my becoming a nurse. He
always thought that I should have a secured job, and to him this
was the most secured job you could have. So he's the one who
actually took me around to the various nursing schools, to be
interviewed.

Hedenkairp:

Was he in the health care field?

Blake:

Not at all.

Hedenkairp:

He just thought that was a good field to be in.

Blake:

We had a family friend who was a nurse, and he thought she
had a great job.

Hedenkairp:

What was your pre-nursing education like, before you came
to Stanford or Lane?

Gillingham:

Oh, well, mine was all in Compton, California, and I went
through the whole school system, up through the junior college.
The war was on at that time, so there really wasn't too much

motivation to get into a freshman class, and I really hadn't
planned to start, to go to Stanford. I was prepped for UC,
because where I went to school, they didn't counsel you too
well, and all they knew about was USC and UC. I went over to UC
and I was interviewed and they couldn't even remember my name.
I told my mother, "There's got to be a better place to go to
school, because I want my degree." Then we just looked up
Stanford; they had a school, and we made an appointment.
Blake:

I had that exact same experience. I was interviewed at UC,
and they could not care less, they were very impersonal. I just
didn't enjoy that interview at all.

Gillingham:

It was awful.

Blake:

And then I went to Stanford and was interviewed by Sally
Heitman, and she was so warm and nice and wonderful.

Gillingham:

Yes, she was.

Blake:

And I said, "This is where I want to go."

Gillingham:

Especially after this terrible thing over at UC.

Blake:

Exactly.

Gillingham:

There we'd had the appointment for weeks, and they could
not remember my name. The director of nurses was doing
something for the war effort, because my class was the last
class that came in as a cadet nurse. So we went through all the
the telegram process. "The war is over. We don't knew whether
the bill is going to keep on funding the nursing class, and how
many are coming in versus how many would have to drop out."

Hedenkamp:

Can you just tell us a little bit more about the cadet
nursing program?

Gillingham:

Well, these kids were even in it longer than I was,
because, see, all the classes during the war came in on the
cadet program, didn't they.

Blake:

Right.

Gillingham:

Whose uniform did I borrow to go home? Was it yours? This
is Sylvia Oskie[?], and I think it was yours. I can't remember
whose. Because we had to borrow uniforms to go home that first
Christmas.

Blake:

Because we had military uniforms.

Hedenkamp:

I see.

Blake:

We had summer and winter uniforms. The cadet nurse corps
paid our tuition and books.

Gillingham:

Bought our uniforms.

Blake:

Bought our uniforms.

Hedenkaitp:

So the uniforms you wore as student nurses were not
Stanford School of Nursing uniforms?

Blake:

No, they were. But in addition to that we had a cadet
nursing uniform for summer and winter with the beret and red
things on the shoulders. And all that we had to do was agree to
remain in "essential nursing" . . .

Gillingham:

Stay in essential nursing.

Blake:

. . . for the duration of the war.

Gillingham:

The emergency, which Truman, I think, declared over
sometime in 1946.

Blake:

And we got a check. How much did we get a month?

[unknown voice from the background]:
Fifteen dollars a month for the first third. Twenty, and

4

the last third was thirty.
Hedenkamp:

Fifteen, twenty, and thirty.

Gillingham:

One was six months, and then about a year and a half, and
then the last six months, something like that.

Hedenkamp:

So the cadet nursing program did continue all through your
undergraduate years?

Gillingham:

They finally found that all over the country, enough girls
were going to have to drop out of the nursing programs. I think
I added up what we would have had to pay for the whole program,
and it was less than $500, I think. For the whole three years.
Plus we'd have to buy our own uniforms.

Blake:

And books, and things.

Gillingham:

And books, and things.

Blake:

And board, and what have you.

Gillingham:

No, see, the hospital paid that, because we were actually
working for the hospital. If the students hadn't been there,
that place would have folded up and died. Jeanie Green and
Janie Khox, as seniors, were the head nurses on the medical
floor, and they stayed down there after they graduated and ran
those floors for, what, two years.

Blake:

Oh, right. The entire hospital was nothing but students.
There were very few graduate nurses.

Gillingham:

They were all on the graduate side, or on the private side.

Blake:

But the clinic side was all run by nurses. Remember that,
Sylvia?

Hedenkamp:

What were the first days like? What was your first
impression when you started?

5

Gillingham:

Oh, God, I don't even remember. It was such a fog.

Blake:

My first impression was I could not believe that it was
pitch dark out and I was getting up. We entered training in
February, and we had big sisters who came and woke us up in the
morning, said "Time to get up!" I mean, I don't get up in the
dark. That was my most incredible expression. Had I known that
I would have to get up in the dark for the rest of my life, I
don't knew if I would have gone on.

Gillingham:

Well, the idea of getting up at six o'clock in the
morning. Come on!

Blake:

That's it. It's pitch dark.

Gillingham:

Oh, it was terrible.

Hedenkamp:

Where did you live? Your big sisters lived in the same
place?

Blake:

Yes. We all lived in one big nurses' residence, in the
city.

Hedenkamp:

What was it like?

Blake:

It was great.

Gillingham:

It was fun. It was like living in a girls' . . .

Blake:

Dormitory.

Gillingham:

. . . dorm or sorority house. Most of us all had rooms by
ourselves. I think there were a few doubled up.

Blake:

Not at the beginning.

Gillingham:

Not at the beginning.

Blake:

Most of our class was doubled up.

Gillingham:

But by the time we got there, I don't think there were too
many that were doubled up.

Blake:

Because the cadet nurse program increased enrollment in
nursing schools, and the residence was not built for that many
people, they had to double you up; so they put in bunk beds.

Gillingham:

Oh, yes.

Blake:

It was wonderful.

Gillingham:

I had forgotten about those. But I just remember Joanne
Wolff and Patti Murphy sharing a corner. So they had a private
bath, which was really the bee's knees, because the rest of us,
we all had basins in our rooms, but where I lived . . .

Blake:

Communal bathrooms.

Gillingham:

. . . clear out at the end way, the johns and the showers
and the bathtubs were clear at the other end of the hall. The
residence, I think, is still standing, isn't it.

Blake:

It's all doctors' offices now.

Gillingham:

Art Jampulsky[?] had an office over there for a while.

Blake:

They have administrative offices, and it looks completely
different. But they still have that same old elevator, that
chugs up.

Gillingham:

You could walk it faster than that thing would move.

Hedenkamp:

Hew many people were in your class, then, that started in
February?

Blake:

The February class was always the small one, and I think we
started with twenty-one, and three dropped out. I think three
dropped out, and then we inherited a couple from another class
who had taken time off. So I think we ended up with
twenty-one. But the spring classes, or the fall classes, I
don't know. The '48-11. . . .

7

Gillingham:

The second section.

Blake:

The second section was always a larger class for some
reason, and so they had in the thirties.

Gillingham:

Although the one the year preceding us was smaller, because
I think that one class of fifty-something was one of the biggest
ones. The Doles were in that class, weren't they. I don't
remember what year that was.

Blake:

Well, Rachel was in our class, and Nancy . . .

Gillingham:

Well, Nancy was in the other one.

Blake:

. . . was ahead of us, yes.

Gillingham:

Because I think we had thirty-three, and Jody Faw[?]
dropped out. I think Jody dropped out before we were capped, or
right after, and then we had one other girl leave. I don't
remember what her name was.

Hedenkairp:

What was the capping like, the ceremony? And when was it?

Gillingham:

Don't ask me the date.

Blake:

It was six, four months.

Gillingham:

I couldn't tell you.

Hedenkairp:

Four months.

Blake:

Because of the war, and the shortage and everything, it
used to be six months but they shortened it to four months.

Hedenkairp:

Was it a formal ceremony.

Blake:

Oh, yes. We carried candles.

Gillingham:

Yes. Candles, and parents came up.

Blake:

Parents came. We had an auditorium in the nurses'
residence. It was quite a deal.

Gillingham:

Yes, it was. It was pretty.

Blake:

We marched in with our lit candles and then we took an
oath, right?

Gillingham:

And then our big sisters put our hats on. The one thing I
remember is, we had a French laundry nearby that used to do a
magnificent job on our collars and caps. So we all sent them
out specially to be done, and somebody decided the process was
going to be changed. Because mine came back limp. It was
terrible. A bunch of us had them come back. They were so liitp,
so we went back to the other ones that were not quite as clean,
but they certainly were a lot stiffer.

Blake:

Ours were really stiff.

Gillingham:

Because they did go back. But for that one time, when we
wanted them especially done, they just did a terrible job on
it. It was such a disappointment. That's the one thing I
remember, and I think mine was in February. But I couldn't tell
you the date.

Hederikamp:

What do you remember about the faculty? Who were they,
what were your first impressions?

Gillingham:

Oh, boy. Well, Mrs. Eriksen, of course, was our probie
instructor.

Blake:

I thought she was wonderful.

Gillingham:

She was fantastic.

Blake:

She was from Johns Hopkins, and every time I make a bed and
make a square corner, I think of her. Or put a drawsheet. My
mother's ill new and I have to use drawsheets on the bed, and I
have to make the tightest drawsheet.

Gillingham:

I just got through doing the same thing for my dad last

weekend. He was in the hospital and he was so upset because he
thought he'd soiled the bed, because he just had some bladder
surgery, and one of the criteria for him to go home was that he
had to produce a certain amount before they'd let him go home,
after the catheter came out. And the poor man thought he wet
the bed, and what had happened, you knew, with these plastic
mattress covers now, which, they're just as bad, if not worse,
than those old rubber sheets. He'd been sweating so, that the
sheets were damp. And then he bounced out of bed for whatever
reason and looked at them and said, "Is it wet?", and I said,
"No." He said, "Well, it feels it." I said, "Well, it's because
you've been sweating so." You could just see him change, you
know. He was so relieved.
Blake:

So you put a tight drawsheet . .

Gillingham:

Well, I grabbed a bath sheet that was there and I thought,
we'll fix this, so I just put a new bath sheet on.

Blake:

But she really was a wonderful instructor.

Gillingham:

Well, she had a real feel for patients.

Blake:

She really did.

Gillingham:

And part, an attitude, I think.

[Voice from the background]:
She was super refined, super lady.
Blake:

A real role model.

Gillingham:

A true role model for a nurse.

[Voice]:

Immaculate and well groomed. Not stiff.

Blake:

Just absolutely immaculate is right.

[Voice]:

Just looked beautiful, every morning.

10

Blake:

At all times.

Gillingham:

Well, yes. Somebody said something . . .

[Voice]:

And she was a beautiful woman.

Gillingham:

She was. All Lane Hospital was pretty bad by modern
standards. It wasn't so bad then. We thought it wasn't all
that bad, but it was, you knew. But I always remember, she
said, "There's a very nice way to do it, when you have all of
the facilities, and all of the equipment at hand. We don't have
that here. However, we are going to do it nicely, we're going
to do it well with what we have."

Blake:

Exactly.

Gillingham:

And I've forgotten who said something today, something to
that effect. That, you knew, you make do.

Hederikamp:

The best with what you can.

Gillingham:

And you'll make it nice and you'll make it comfortable for
the patients.

Blake:

And then we always had two senior students, who assisted
her, who were called probie pushers. And they would supervise
us on the wards, and help us. They were very nice.

Hederikamp:

Who was the dean or the director when you were there?

Blake:

Sally Heitman. Wasn't it Sally Heitman when we first got
there? And then Grace Ringressy probably; when did she come?

Gillingham:

About a year later, from what she said today. We were
asking her about it, because I guess, apparently, Sally was
acting director, even when we came in.

Blake:

That's right, yes. I don't know whose place she took.

Gillingham:

Miss Ringressy said something about a Miss Fohe.

11

[Voice]:

She's a public health instructor.

Hedenkamp:

As students, did you have a lot to do with the dean?

Gillingham:

No.

Blake:

Not very much. Not very much at all.

Gillingham:

Unless you were on the carpet, which would happen once in a
vfaile.

[Voice]:

Here's one of the things I remember about seeing the dean:
my uncle passed away in Palo Alto, and that was really the only
time I ever had to see her about something important. The day
of his funeral, I had to get in full uniform, go to her office,
and report and get permission to go to Palo Alto to his
funeral. After I got her permission, and got my clothes changed
up in my room, I got the very last possible train I could catch
to make his funeral. I felt so hurt to think that I had to go
through that. They were, at that moment, I felt, very uncaring
about letting me go to this funeral. Then I almost missed it,
after I got the permission. But that was the only unpleasant
thing that happened to me in my three years probably, that I
recall. And I thought, my goodness, this would never happen
today.

Gillingham:

But we had definite rules.

Blake:

Oh, yes.

Gillingham:

Like, we had hours.

Blake:

You had to be in by ten o'clock unless you had special
permission. The first year, what is it, we had one
twelve-thirty a week.

Gillingham:

I think, yes, one twelve-thirty a week, and then the second

year, two twelve-thirties, and then the third year, was it
unlimited?
Blake:

Well, it was open season. The last year.

Gillingham:

I think it was open season by the time we were seniors.

Blake:

But we felt very fortunate in that we didn't have lights
out.

Gillingham:

Yes, that's one thing we didn't have to do.

Blake:

Lots of schools of nursing—there were like four or five
schools of nursing in San Francisco at that time—they had
lights out, and nuns would come around and see that they were in
bed by 9:30 or 10:00.

Hedenkairp:

So Stanford was relatively liberal?

Blake:

We felt that we were really in a good place, because we
didn't have to go to bed.

Gillingham:

Even Children's, which was not a church school, they were
pretty strict over there, and St. Francis . . .

Blake:

St. Francis, exactly.

Gillingham:

. . . which was not a Catholic.

Blake:

St. Luke's.

Gillingham:

Then at St. Luke's. St. Luke's is an Episcopal, I think.
Of course, St. Mary's. That was the principal Catholic hospital
there in town. And then there was UC.

Hedenkairp:

Quite a few, then.

Gillingham:

Yes, there were quite a few. We and UC were the only two
degree programs. And I know one thing that used to tick me is
they got a public health certificate and we didn't.

Blake:

In twenty-eight months, instead of thirty-six months.

Gillingham:

And we spent as much time on public health as they did.
They got their certificate and we didn't. That always sort of .
..

Hedenkamp:

Rankled?

Gillingham:

. . . bugged me a little bit. Because it meant extra
school, if you wanted one.

Hedenkamp:

When you started out as probies, what hours did you work?
Did you go through med, surg, and OB, and different specialties?

Gillingham:

Yes. We hit the floors in six weeks.

Blake:

Exactly. And we worked, when we first came in, a
forty-four hour week, remember. For a long time, we got just a
half a day off. Didn't we get to the point where we worked five
days a week?

Gillingham:

I think by the time we came in, we did. But of course, the
war was over, so things were easing off and they were getting
other gals back.

Blake:

We didn't work forty-four hours long, but we did work
forty-four hours for a while.

Gillingham:

Yes we did.

[Voice]:

You could just put in your time and go off duty and get a
call, because another nurse, not a student, was not able to come
to the ward where you were working, and they needed a nurse.
And you'd go back there and maybe work seven to eleven after
having put in your day.

Blake:

You always worked split shifts. Always. You never worked
a straight shift.

[Voice]:

You worked long hours and there was no consideration

14

whether or not you were overworked or overtired.
Gillingham:

Or when you were working nights, you still had to hit your
ten, your one, and your three o'clock classes. Most of the time
you missed one of them . . .

Blake:

You had to go all your classes, that's right.

Gillingham:

. . . or you slept through at least one or two.

Hedenkairp:

How much nights did you work?

Blake:

A lot.

Gillingham:

A lot.

Blake:

You very seldom worked only from seven to three-thirty.
And you very seldom got Saturday and Sunday off.

Gillingham:

Very seldom.

Blake:

Very seldom. It was just like a treat when you got it.

Gillingham:

Well, not only that, but you worked that split shift and
you also had classes. . .

Blake:

In between, when you were off.

Gillingham:

In between.

Blake:

You worked more than eight hours.

Gillingham:

You put in a long day if you counted being in your classes,
too.

Blake:

You were there for every meal, so figure that out. You
gave them lunch, you fed them breakfast, lunch, and you were
there for dinner and to put them to bed. Thinking back over it,
I wonder, "How did we accomplish that?"

Gillingham:

And that was back in the days when you're on P.M.s, like
you'd hit first west, which was men's surgical. You had twenty
patients in the big ward. You had an isolation patient in the

15

cubicle and you had four more on the end.
Hederikamp:

And you were the only nurse?

Gillingham:

And you were it. After the kids went off at seven o'clock,
you might have had a couple of aides.

Blake:

You were it.

Gillingham:

You were it. You may have had an orderly, you may have had
an aide.

Blake:

Possibly.

Gillingham:

Once in a great while you had them both. Do you remember
Hadding Robinson[?], who used to be on first west? She was one
of Peter's patients, when I came back and started working in an
office. I remember, she saved my life more than once, because
she was such a sweetheart.

Hederikamp:

So as students, you were totally responsible, while you
were on, for all those patients? No graduate nurses?

Blake:

Absolutely. Oh, never. You were just it.

Gillingham:

Particularly P.M.s and nights.

Blake:

And then you got to the point where you were the senior
student and you were in charge. But you had students in charge
of you.

Gillingham:

Oh, yes.

Blake:

Older students, but you ran the entire ward. And there was
a graduate supervisor who supervised everything. Remember Miss
tenBosch[?], who was a surgical supervisor? And I can't—who
was the medical supervisor, I don't remember?

[Voice]:

Ritter?

Gillingham:

Madeline Ritter was downstairs. And Natalie Lawrence was
upstairs.

Blake:

Bessie Lawrence, yes. She took over from Miss tenBosch[?]
who had multiple sclerosis.

Gillingham:

Because I remember Lawrence more than I do any other.

Hedenkairp:

Something comes to mind that maybe hasn't been recounted by
anyone else. Every time you made rounds with the night
supervisor on pediatrics, you had to know the age, name and
diagnosis of every infant.

Blake:

Well, every patient.

[Voice]:

Every patient, that's right. Every patient in pediatrics.
And if you had been off for a night, you came on during the
afternoon on your own time, copied down the beds and the cribs
and the name, diagnosis, and went back to your room and
memorized that, and you could not use a flashlight.

Blake:

It wasn't just pediatrics, though; it was everything with
Miss Sykes.

[Voice]:

But I remember, pediatrics had more patients.

Gillingham:

Oh, yes, because you were all over the place.

[Voice]:

You didn't have that personal contact with the patient so
that you'd remember names.

[Voice2]:

I can remember Sunday putting that list up when I was home,
drying the dishes. My mother got so she knew the patients. I'd
go down and then I'd miss one and she'd say,
"Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah." You know, sixty.

[Voice]:

That seems to be incredible, as I look back on it.

Gillingham:

Half of my class got that. The other half had very little;

we put in our minimum time on pediatrics. I think I worked
P.M.s, but I don't think I ever worked nights on peeds.
Hedenkamp:

What was the unit like? I mean, were parents permitted to
visit?

Blake:

There were set visiting hours.

Gillingham:

We had very set visiting hours, and the ward was chopped up
into all kinds of closets, almost. We had two or three
nurseries, and then you had the other . . .

Blake:

Clean nursery, dirty nursery, and isolation.

Gillingham:

So there were three small nurseries, and then they had
wards with two or three or four cribs in them. I don't think we
ever got children in there over about eight or ten years old.

Blake:

Well, I can remember my very first day in the newborn
nursery. I had never seen a newborn baby in my whole life. And
my first day was a Sunday. I went in and there was one graduate
who was going off, and she said, "Let me show you how to bathe
the baby." And she goes swish, swish, swish, OK. And here was
this entire nursery full of babies to wash. I was just
terrified. They were so slippery. I thought, "Oh my God, I
know I'm going to drop one of these little creatures."

Hedenkamp:

What about feeding them?

Blake:

Well, you propped, you propped every one of them.

[Voice]:

You had to prop them.

Blake:

You had to.

[Voice]:

Or you got awfully good holding their heads with their
bottoms in your elbow, and feeding them. And you were feeding
one while you were going around checking the rest of them.

18

Blake:

That's right. When you got to the last bottle, the first
one threw up, because nobody had time to burp them. And in
between each baby you had to put your arms into Zephyron[?] or
something up to the elbows. Somebody would always be peeking.
If you missed doing that, they always caught you.

[Voice]:

Yes. Because you had big windows. You'd look up and here
would be a supervisor keeping an eye on you. I remember,
though, one P.M. shift; the drill sergeant—what was that big,
heavy gal's name that was the P.M.?—Steinman, or something.
But anyway, we had this rather large—ten, eleven pound—black
baby who was only about seven hours old. And, you know, they
used to hold fluids on them for the first twelve hours. And
this kid started in. He had lungs that were going to wake
everybody in the place up. There was a grad on with me. You
did not have a noisy nursery when the supervisors came around.
You had that place like a tomb, or they'd say, "What's wrong?
What are you doing that you aren't supposed to be doing?" Here
was this kid yelling and beginning to wake everyone up, and I
said, "I don't know about you, but I'm stuffing some sugar water
in his mouth." We'd got to shut him up, because he was so big.

Blake:

I remember that I was working nights in the nursery once,
and they brought a newborn from lying-in, and no one had ever
briefed me what to do with a newborn, and I just sat there. To
whoever brought it in, I said, "Well, what am I supposed to do?
Just watch it?" You know, basically, looking back on some of
those things, it was a little hair-raising.

Gillingham:

When I think about it, our class—I don't know whether you

ever got caught in that triple shift in two days routine that
was going on?
Blake:

Yes. Days, nights, and P.M.s consecutively.

Gillingham:

We'd work the day shift, we'd get off at three, we'd go
back to work at eleven, we'd get off at seven, then we'd go back
to work at three the next afternoon. There might be two or
three or four girls working that kind of a shift, which I never
understood, because I left that place with lots of time coming.
We had to go to classes while we were doing this. But I
remember, Miss Whatever-her-name was knocking on the window.
I'm in the preemie nursery with a baby in my lap and a bottle in
its mouth, and I'm asleep on the P.M. shift. I mean, it was
scary.

Blake:

I remember sleeping through almost all of communicable
diseases.

Gillingham:

I slept through surgery.

Blake:

I mean, you just absolutely could not hold your eyes open.
Until I went into training, I never in my entire life had stayed
up all night. Had you? And remember, when you first worked
nights, you just couldn't even eat. You just felt so horrible.

Gillingham:

It was the worst shock to the system. One of the things I
remember about nights, too, is after I had come back from
mononucleosis. I had been off for almost two months. I missed
being dropped from the cadet corps by about three days, I think,
because I'd been out so long. I was three weeks in the hospital
and I was three or four at home. I think Jenny Biddle[?] got
dropped because she had so much time off, and they were ready to

call me and say, if they heard I wasn't coming back, "Get back
here, you're going to lose the cadet." But that's when we went
into electric

, while I was off. Remember all those

awful Wagenstein[?] bottles that we used to have to shift
around?
Blake:

Right.

Gillingham:

And when I came back I worked one day on women's surgery
and then they put me onto nights. They figured that would be
the easiest way to run me. All I remember doing is coming on
that night and here are all these little red lights on first
east. "What's going on back there?" "Well, we got in
electric

today." And I said, "Well, what do you do

with them?" She said, "You don't have to do anything. Just
make sure the lights keep blinking." Because, you know, those
Wagensteins, you have to watch the water levels and all that
other stuff. God, they don't even know what they're doing these
days.
Hedenkamp:

So that was a big change for you?

Gillingham:

It was a huge change for everybody, really.

Blake:

Here's one of the most interesting stories, though, about
nursing school I think I ever heard. I was not in training,
yet, but it must have been several years before. They were just
starting to use penicillin on men's medical as sort of a study.
And of course, penicillin at that dosage was excreted in the
urine. And they used to have to collect all the urine from
every single patient and take it over to the lab, and it had to
be processed so they could recover all the penicillin from it.

21

I thought that was incredible. I was so happy I missed that.
Gillingham:

Well, of course, you were there when they still had that
penicillin ward running, because I think, when we got there,
they closed the penicillin ward. That's when they had
penicillin going five hours out of six in IVs.

Blake:

We used to give it every three hours and we used to mix up
30 cc syringes for each patient every morning, and then you
would give them 3 cc every three hours around the clock. And we
had patients with SBE who had buttocks that were just like
granite.

[Voice]:

Oh, it was IM

, huh?

Blake:

Yes, IM.

Gillingham:

Once they figured they could give an IM, they closed down
the IV wards, because that ward on the second floor wasn't
cleared out. It was in between up, right close to where the two
hospitals, Lane and Stanford, came together. I've forgotten
what they called it. Was it second east?

Blake:

I don't remember. Second east, that could be. Second east
was one of those very mysterious place I never worked. Did you
ever work on second east?

Gillingham:

The only thing that I remember was that one man that we all
got practice on turning a comatose patient over, because this
guy was a terminal, third-stage tertiary luetic, so he was out
of it from the syphilis. And he was a huge man, just a huge
man, and this is where we all got our practice turning this guy
over.

Hederikamp:

Was it rare to have comatose patients?

Gillingham:

For us, I didn't see too many. Teaching hospitals, I
think, are so different from the average.

Blake:

We didn't have any patients that were just like custodial
care. They were acute. We had a lot of unconscious terminal
patients on medical. I mean, medical was just incredible.

Gillingham:

Could be terrible at times.

Blake:

We were there, you know, on medical when the army put
aerosol germs in the air. Serratia marcescens. Remember? I
don't remember at the time, but I didn't have any symptoms. But
it was exactly the time that we were on medical. These patients
were getting these mysterious illnesses, and we did have a lot
of unexplained fevers. That would be their diagnosis when they
were admitted.

Gillingham:

I think what we had a lot of was the SBE.

[Voice]:

They'd bring in wardfulls to study; they'd come from all
over the Bay Area.

Gillingham:

Any time you got into certain specialities—well, like in
pediatrics, half my class knows all there is to know about—oh,
it's the one with the lung mucus. What's the name?

Hedenkamp:

Cystic fibrosis?

Gillingham:

Cystic fibrosis. Half of my class knows a lot about cystic
fibrosis. Part of my class knows all about hydrocephalics[?],
because when I was on peeds, what we had was hydrocephalics, and
kids would go into nephritis [?].

Blake:

Dr. Addis was there when we were in training.

Gillingham:

Yes. He was still alive and doing all sorts of things.
You know, we had a fantastic faculty.

23

Blake:

Dr. Bloomfield.

Gillingham:

And Dr. Holman.

Blake:

Dr. Rytand. We did. We had a wonderful faculty.

Hederikamp:

The faculty was primarily physicians, it sounds like.

Blake:

The med school was there at the same time.

Gillingham:

See, the med school was there, too.

[Voice]:

We'd go to the ampitheater for lectures with the students.

Blake:

Yes, so you could go to those. And then they had grand
rounds every Friday morning and rounds every day.

Gillingham:

Then they had special rounds every new and then in the
amphitheater. I remember when they had all the chiefs: Dr.
Bloomfield, Dr. Holman, the man that was in charge of x-ray,
that big tall man [Dr. Newell]. And they got into it about
something. It was a fascinating argument? each was protecting
his own specialty.

Blake:

They just fought. I mean, they just never stopped
fighting.

Gillingham:

They fought constantly.

[END OF SIDE A]

[BEGINNING OF SIDE B]

Hedenkamp:

Tell me about historical events that happened. Did the war
end after you started nursing school?

Gillingham:

I came in in September of 1945; the war ended in August.
The war's what changed the whole pattern of nurses' training.

Blake:

It was interesting, when we went into training, we had to
hand in our ration books, remember?

Gillingham:

We had to bring ours too.

Blake:

Didn't we have to hand in our shoe coupons? We had to use
our shoe coupon for nurses' shoes, and we were just very
resentful of the fact.

Gillingham:

I remember. We did have to bring our books.

Blake:

We had to hand in our books, right.

Hedenkairp:

What values did you learn in nursing school, aside from the
curriculum?

Gillingham:

Oh, my gosh. You mean in addition to what we must have
come in with?

Hedenkairp:

Ethical values, or nurse-physician relationship kinds of
things.

Blake:

We didn't really think of nurse-physician relationships in
those days, because they were the chiefs, right? And when we
got in the elevator, they got in first. When they came on the
ward, we stood up. And I tell the doctors I work with that
today, and they think, "God, I wish we were there then."
[Laughter]

Gillingham:

The only problem was you were also going to school with the
med school, and you were dating these guys. So all of a sudden
they put on white collars; it was a little difficult,
sometimes. Once they became the doctors, they were the doctors.

Blake:

But you had a good relationship with them.

Gillingham:

Yes, you did.

Blake:

Like working in the operating room, you would knew a doctor

from the time he was a medical student? then he became an intern
and a resident, and what have you; then he finally finished and
became a private physician. But in those days you were working
with all Stanford men, which was great, because now I don't, and
I don't have a relationship with all of them. There are a few
who are still there that I've known since they were interns, and
now they've been out, like, thirty years or something, but
they're still really close friends of mine. That kind of
relationship doesn't exist any more, and I don't think it ever
would.
Gillingham:

Except if you meet these guys later. I worked for Milt
Rosenberg[?] for a while, before we moved to San Luis Obispo,
and there was a rapport, which everybody in the office
resented. His partner was Dan Newstein[?], and I didn't know
him, but he was a very nice friend. But the rapport between
Milt and me was still there, because he was a resident when I
was a student and then a graduate. It's a different situation
these days. In a way I miss it, and in a way I don't.

Blake:

But the one thing, I think, was that we learned to give
patients really good care. And we cared about patients, we
talked about patients, and I'm sure that student nurses don't do
that now. But we used to; that was our main conversation
amongst ourselves. We all worked in different areas and we
would compare patients. But we were interested in taking care
of these people.

Gillingham:

We gave them good nursing care.

Blake:

As much, as good as we could do. I think every one of us

26

did the best we possibly could.
Gillingham:

I just don't see it in the hospitals or even in the
attitudes of the girls that are in nursing new. In the first
place, they don't have any patient contact, really, until after
they have gotten their license, and this, I think, is really
sad. They get a little bit of observation. As I was telling
Miss Ringressy today, I fired off a letter to her one day, I was
so mad. I was working in the clinic at Kaiser, in the OB/Gyn
department, and we had some San Francisco State kids there
observing. Well, they could talk the arm off of you when it
came to books, but when it came to dealing with the
practicalities of taking care of the patients, removing things
from rooms and stuff like that, they didn't care. I boiled over
when I came and here was this pan of bloody speculums that this
gal had brought in. She didn't even turn the water on. Come
on! You knew, I mean, the practical, working side of it.

Blake:

This is what Mrs.

taught you. Hew to wash

everything.
Gillingham:

Well, it was the first thing you did when you went on a
ward, as a student nurse; that's how they got their utility
rooms clean, because every probie class that came in cleaned
every utility room in the building.

Blake:

That's right.

Gillingham:

They could hardly wait for us to get there.

[Voice]:

But we also did the medicine cabinets, even though they'd
just been done within a month by the last group of students.
They pointed out to us that not only didn't they need to be

cleaned, but we would certainly know where every medication was,
for the rest of cur service on the ward.
Blake:

lhat whole place was immaculate.

[Voice]:

I mean, there was a double purpose for this, and some
people resented having to do cleaning chores, but there was more
to it.

Gillingham:

Well, you know, I think that still sticks with me now, and
that's why every time I hit a new office, the first thing I do
is clean the place. Because then you do know where everything
is. It has followed me through, actually, on all of the offices
I've worked in, ever since I've been out.

Blake:

Another thing, we had very little ancillary help. I mean,
porters, orderlies, aides. There was no such thing as a nurses'
aide. You were lucky if you had a porter mopping up.

Gillingham:

And a maid in the kitchen.

Blake:

Nobody cleaned anything. I mean, you cleaned and you did
everything. You just didn't say, "Orderly." There weren't any.

Hederikamp:

What do you remember about state boards and about
graduation?

Gillingham:

Well, that's kind of awkward, at least for my class,
because we graduated from Stanford before we finished training.
You graduated, but then you had to come back.

Blake:

I remember that I had been working for, it seemed to me,
quite a while before state boards rolled around.

Gillingham:

State boards were in November, because I just made it. I
got out within a week of state boards, because I was delayed by
illness. A bunch of us were in Southern California for a

vacation, and we all came back up on the Daylight to take
boards. When I took them, and I guess when you did too, it was
two and a half days.
Blake:

Two and a half days. And I didn't think they were all that
bad.

[Voice]:

I took mine in Los Angeles. And I was the only one in my
class down there.

Gillingham:

Oh, really?

[Voice]:

And ours were given the day before they were given up
here. Janet, my colleague, told me the date that she remembered
and how terrified she was after I told her about them. But I
can remember standing there with all these strangers. I'd had
my training at Stanford and, looking around in Southern
California at the girls with whom I was going to be taking state
boards, I felt a great sense of relief. I thought, "I know that
if they're going to 'pass this exam,' I'll do more than just
pass it." I felt that I'd had a better education.

Gillingham:

One thing where we all darn near flunked was the nursing
history. I think they spent less time on nursing history, at
least for us, than any class.

Blake:

We had nursing history like you wouldn't believe, with Miss
Sykes.

Gillingham:

We had it, but our class almost flunked nursing history.
It was terrible.

Hedenkamp:

Did you have a graduation ceremony?

Gillingham:

Not really.

Blake:

We came down here and got our degrees. We had a cap and

29

gown here, but we didn't have any ceremony in the city.
Gillingham:

The last day you worked as a student, you came to work in
whites.

Blake:

Oh, I remember. Miss Ringressy called us in and gave us
our pins.

Gillingham:

You got your pins. But the day before you'd show up in
Elites is the day you went off duty and they yanked your
uniform. Some of the girls just barely made it to the quarters
with any clothes on. I remember Jean McKenney really got ripped
up, and Frolli.

Blake:

I remember that.

Gillingham:

I lost a sleeve, I think, and things of that sort. We
didn't have a formal graduation with just the nursing group.

Blake:

We all didn't graduate at the same time, because they were
very meticulous about how many days you had put in. If you had
been ill or something like that, one would graduate one day,
another in two more days. You just sort of trickled out. It
wasn't like capping, where everybody got capped at the same
time.

Hedenkamp:

What memorable experiences in your professional lives as a
nurse have you had?

Gillingham:

Oh, good heavens.

Blake:

I've had so many.

Gillingham:

I can believe it.

Blake:

I don't know. I have worked in surgery ever since I
graduated.

Hedenkamp:

In the operating room?

30

Blake:

Yes. All ofrayprofessional life.

Gillingham:

She has watched all of the cardiac surgery develop. She
was in on the ground floor.

Blake:

I did it before they had a heart-lung machine, and then,
when they developed the heart-lung machine, I went to the dog
lab and did it there, and then came back. So I've been doing
that since 1956. New we are doing liver transplants, in
addition. We've done, down here, fifty-two heart transplants.

Hederikamp:

Where are you working?

Blake:

Presbyterian. With a lot of help from Stanford, I must
say. Fortunately, Stanford's been very friendly to us.

Hederikamp:

That's always nice.

Blake:

We got a lot of help. We spent a day down here with the
nurses in the operating room and got a lot of hints and tips.

Gillingham:

Well, I think it's only fair to say that Marilyn was Dr.
Holman's scrub nurse, she was Dr. Gerbode[?] »s scrub nurse,
before, when we did the blue baby work, Dr. Holman's wife, who
was involved, she would work up the children.

Hederikamp:

What was her name?

Blake:

Doctor Ann Purdy.

Gillingham:

Purdy, Dr. Ann Purdy. And so they were doing blue baby
work at Stanford when I was still working in the operating
room. I don't know whether it ever struck anybody, the way it
did me, but I can remember one day, when we started cracking
valves, before we had the heart-lung machines. I never saw one
of those work, but I can remember when we were doing the valve
cracking. I remember Dr. Gerbode putting his hand in this heart

with a purse string around his finger, and then he turned his
back on the patient so he could turn around and watch the EKG
machine. And he said, "There's one, OK. There's two, all
right. There goes a third one." You know, he's just flipping
his finger inside this patient's heart, and it's just an
incredible situation. Compared to what they're doing now,
that's pretty primitive.
Blake:

Even after the advent of the heart-lung machine, it was
considered safer to do it that way than to 'subject' the patient
to the heart-lung machine. But now, that is such a safe
procedure, having been done so many thousands of times, that
everything's done on machines.

Gillingham:

Oh, I'm sure.

Blake:

The morbidity is so low.

Gillingham:

Well, now you can do it without having to shut down the
heart circulation, which you're able to do with that machine.
So you've got a stopped heart that you can open up and look at
what you're doing.

Blake:

And really look.

Gillingham:

And really see what's going on. But just the idea, here he
is with his finger like this and with his back to the patient,
and he's standing there very casually, "OK, there's one.
There's two." Another time I remember in the operating room, we
had a chest open for some reason. Dr. Holman was in on it, and
Dr. Richard was too. Now, why those two were on the same deal,
I'll never know? but for some reason we had this chest open.
We'd started to close, and somebody set Dr. Holman off, and they

started reciting poetry. Richards and Holman and I think Harry
Howard was giving the anesthesia, and for an hour and a half,
these guys bounced off each other, reciting poetry. It was
fascinating. Usually Dr. Holman would drop out, once he started
to close. He had other things to do. But he got interested. I
think a couple of the kids came in and out, "What's going on in
there?
Blake:

You don't see that any more. You don't see surgeons who
can quote poetry.

Gillingham:

But this was Longfellow and so forth. It was just
incredible.

Blake:

But they all had a classical education.

Gillingham:

Yes, they did. You know, things like that really stick
out, as much as dramatic things.

Hedenkairp:

What would you tell a young girl or a young man, a person
wanting to be a nurse today?

Gillingham:

You're too late. You didn't get the education we got.

Blake:

I don't know. I think I would tell them to be a doctor. I
really would. For the amount of time that you spend in
training, I really would almost say, if it were my daughter, "Be
a doctor." For a couple of more years, do it.

Gillingham:

It's a whole different profession. It's sad, really.

Blake:

It's sad. It's really sad.

Gillingham:

Because they aren't getting the training we got. They
aren't getting the attitudes developed that we had. I mean,
some of these kids really are conscientious people, but I think
they really missed a lot of what nursing used to be all about.

Now, maybe that's being too sentimental about the whole thing,
and maybe I haven't changed with the times. But it's gotten so
mechanical and there are so many demands being put on the girls.
Blake:

That's it. The demands.

Gillingham:

As far as what they can do, or have to do. I don't know
whether I'd counsel somebody to go into nursing now, I really
don't.

Blake:

There's nursing, nursing and nursing. If you're telling
them to go into nursing, then they can go to a state college and
became a nurse and hardly ever see a patient. And to me, that's
not nurse's training. Then, for example, for an operating room
nurse, they finish their two years, hardly ever see a patient;
then they have to enter another program to become a surgical
nurse, and then they start all over again. And they pay a big
fee for that postgraduate training. But there is no training
they can get other than that to became a surgical nurse. So, I
think that there are just too many ways to became a nurse.

Gillingham:

Well, you don't really have to be a nurse to be same of
these things anymore, either.

Blake:

Physicians' assistants are becoming more and more common.
Because nursing is, I think, not "together." We don't present a
united front at all, and we are letting all these people enter
and just take off and do our work, do our job. Even for me. We
have several physicians' assistants in cardiac surgery who
assist in surgery. But if you don't watch them, if you're
training another young nurse, this physicians' assistant comes
aver and does everything. I mean, you can have a new nurse

starting out and she sort of hangs back, and so you have to tell
this physicians1 assistant that this is our job, this is what we
do, this is not your jcto; but in a nice way, because sometimes
they're helping you out by doing it. But, nevertheless, these
people are invading nursing. Not just physicians' assistants.
Hedenkamp:

And we've invited them in, in some ways.

Blake:

That's right. We have not presented a united front and we
have not defended our turf.

Gillingham:

I can remember going home one day, and my husband[?]
saying, "Oh, I could get any gas station attendant in here and
do the job you're doing." I said, "Congratulations, Roy.
Try." We didn't say that, but we sure thought it.

Blake:

But the thing is, you just constantly have to defend
yourself and assert yourself, and you get really tired of it.

Gillingham:

I'm sure you do. You probably have seen it much more than
I have, because in an office situation it's a whole different
ballpark.

Blake:

That' s right.

Hedenkamp:

Is there anything else you'd like to share?

Blake:

I really have enjoyed my career.

Hedenkamp:

That' s wonderful.

Gillingham:

Yes. She's had a fascinating one, I'm sure.

Hedenkamp:

Sounds like it.

Blake:

I have liked it.
