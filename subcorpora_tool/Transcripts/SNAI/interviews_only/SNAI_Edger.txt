First, we are interested in what your motivation was when
you became a nurse, when you decided.
I think the reason I wanted to became a nurse was because
my mother was a nurse; she served as a Red Cross nurse in the
First World War over in France. So, from the time I can
remember, I was slated to be a nurse. I went to Pasadena City
College and had all these plans to go to Huntington Memorial,
which was a small hospital in Pasadena. Bat one of my
counselors said, well, with your grades you really should go to
a college program. She was very fond of Stanford, so that is
hew I happened to go there.
Was she an alumna of Stanford?
No. She was not even a nurse. She was just a counselor
at the college. I was very grateful for that advice.
Were you interviewed for the position? Were there
entrance exams?
No, we had to write a letter, an application, and I did
write an autobiography, more or less, events of my life. I
still have that at home.
How wonderful.
That was kind of interesting, because at the time I said I
wanted to be a public health nurse, and, if the war still
continued, to be a navy nurse. But I did became a public
health nurse later on, after I graduated.

Adams:

The war was over by the time you graduated?

Edgar:

The war was over in August, and we went in in September.
They told us we could have the cadet program benefits, but when
we got up there, they said, well, we aren't sure. Finally they
decided that we would be the last class, which really was nice,
because they paid us so much a month and paid for our uniforms
and tuition and books, which was really a super thing.

Adams:

What were the requirements of the nurse cadet program?

Edgar:

Well, at that time they said that you should be in some
form of nursing after graduation.

Adams:

For a set period of time?

Edgar:

I think most of us did. No, they didn't have a period of
time, but I would say most of the girls did work. I know one
nurse who didn't work until about twenty years after that
time. I think most of them filled the requirement.

Adams:

Did you go up to the school before you applied?

Edgar:

No.

Adams:

Case it out or anything?

Edgar:

I did know one of the girls who was in the class ahead of
me, that was my Big Sister, and she had told me all about it.
So I did know her. There were six of us who went from
Pasadena.

Adams:

Hew nice.

Edgar:

So, we did go up together on the train.

Adams:

What do you remember about your first day there, in the
big city?

Edgar:

I can remember a lot about the city. I know we were told

to wear gloves and hat when we went downtown. It was so
different, you know, from southern California. So I thought
that was kind of neat. And, of course, the restaurants. But
as far asrayfirst day, I don't remember much. I know we had
classes for a long time before we got onto floor duty. Then it
was cleaning and doing very mundane tasks—even turning
mattresses, and things like that.
Adams:

Did nurses usually have those responsibilities as part of
ward care?

Edgar:

I know they don't now, but in our day, we were used that
way. At four months we were capped, and, as time went on, we
got more responsibility. In fact, I think I was in just a year
when I was in charge on nights, and that was kind of a scary
experience, as I was on quite a small ward. It was very
quiet. The night supervisor came up to me and said, "The nurse
is sick down on men's medical." That was a wild place to be
for a girl who hadn't really worked nights. I was the one in
charge, and so she asked me to go down there. I went and got
through the night. I remember her coming by with her probies
[probationary nurses] and saying, "This israylittle angel of
mercy." (Laughs.) I appreciated that, it was kind of neat.
We were put on three-to-eleven early—maybe after six or
seven months, and then you were in charge. You had someone on
until seven. But being that it was so close to the war, we
often had large loads, like four or five patients to do, and
you had to have them done before rounds in the morning, which
was around nine o'clock.

Mams:

Were they all the same kind of treatment? I mean, were
they all TB patients or all something else?

Edgar:

No, no. We had, like men's medical and men's surgical,
women's medical, women's surgical. . . .

Adams:

There could be any number of patients and cases?

Edgar:

As we went along in training, we got services, like we
would have diet kitchen for a month or we'd have obstetrics or
surgery or pediatrics, and for communicable diseases we went
over to Highland Hospital in Oakland.

Adams:

Why to Oakland?

Edgar:

Because we didn't have any communicable disease cases at
Stanford. Sometimes we'd have things break out. I can
remember when we were first in training, they had a case of
small pox, and even though we had all been vaccinated for small
pox, we all had to be revaccinated—it was that serious. Of
course, now it's been eliminated from the world, I think. But
other than that, you'd sometimes find out a patient had TB,
after working with him for a few days. But we wouldn't often
have communicable diseases.

Adams:

What kind of preparation did you have in your pre-nursing
education?

Edgar:

That was at Pasadena City College; it was called Pasadena
Junior College in those days. I had my anatomy, physiology,
chemistry and some required courses like philosophy, economics;
but, as far as nursing courses, we had diet, or nutrition, and
bacteriology. So, a lot of it was taken care of before we got
up there, a lot of the hard things that nurses go through new.

Mams:

When you came up to Stanford, was there a balance between
clinical floor work and course work? Was there more of one
than the other?

Edgar:

At first we had more course work, and then, as the years
went on, it was mostly floor. But I think we had courses up
until about our last six months. I'm not quite sure of that,
but I know that I can remember working nights and then having
to get up at ten for a class, and then going back to sleep and
then getting back up at two. So, it was hard, and one time I
went from nights—we were off at seven and then back at three,
and then off at eleven and back at seven, and that was really
hard. But that didn't happen very often; that was just when
they needed you.

Mams:

What differentiated the probationary period from your
post-capping period, in terms of your responsibilities or your
view of yourself as a nurse?

Edgar:

Well, probationary period was where we did have classes
and learning nursing and things like how to give enemas, how to
give shots. Even after that, we were always graded by the head
nurses, we received a ward rating, they called it. But
probationary period was definitely mostly instruction. Then we
would go on the wards, and at first we'd maybe be given one
patient and had to do all the care.

Adams:

Do you remember your first patient?

Edgar:

No. But I can remember a couple of incidents that were
quite traumatic (laughs). One was giving this blind lady an
enema, and she turned and it went all over the bed. And

6

another time, I went to give my first injection, and it was a
person who had had a lot of shots, and I couldn't get it in.
The skin had so much scar tissue, that was not very easy.
Adams:

There you were, poking away.

Edgar:

Yes. So that was a hard time.

Mams:

Where could you go for help when you needed it, as in that
situation, if you recall?

Edgar:

Well, I think that probably was my probie period, so we
had senior nurses that served. We had one nursing arts
instructor and then we had assistants, I think three. They
always were over us, so there was always someone you could ask.

Mams:

What kind of support, either informal or formal, did you
get for the emotional strain of the schedule or the patient
care?

Edgar:

Well, I think they were always ready to—especially these
student nurses that were seniors—they were always very good.
I know some of us didn't do that well in our materia medica,
which is a math course, in learning how to change medications
that were, like a quarter into an eighth, or whatever, if any
of us weren't doing well, the nursing arts instructor worked
with us, which was very fine. But I think a lot of support
came from each other. I also attended a Bible class, which was
very supportive to me.

Mams:

Was that part of the school, or an off-campus group?

Edgar:

It was started by a group off campus, but we met at school
in one of the rooms. It went on for three years. That was
very important to me.

Mams:

Did you ever consider not continuing training, doing

7

something else?
Edgar:

Ah [sighs]. I was thinking of that today when someone
said about being ready to "pack up" and leave. I think I had
discouraging times, but I don't think that I ever really
considered packing up. I think I was too far from home, in the
first place, to run home to mom. My folks were very good about
writing and coming up to see me. It went fast, too.

Adams:

Were you able to share your nursing and nursing training
experiences with your mother? Swap stories?

Edgar:

Oh, yes, definitely. I always wrote everything that
happened to me.

Adams:

Do you have any of those letters? Did your mother keep
any of them?

Edgar:

No, I don't think she did. I kept a diary, so I have
everything in that, which is neat to look at new. I had a lot
of fears—"Oh, I really failed this time"—and on and on like
that. But there were a lot of nice things that happened, too.
I remember one time we were going to have a dance. I don't
know whether the medical students were invited or not, but I
was on men's medical. I had told them that I was hurrying to
get done by seven. So I was up in my room dressing, and all of
sudden my bell rang and there was an orchid from three of
patients who had gone together to buy it for me.

Adams:

Oh, how super!

Edgar:

They bought it so I could wear it to the dance. There
were other nice things. Patients were never to give us any
money, but you would get, once in a while, nice gifts. For

8

instance, after I graduated and was a graduate nurse, I worked
at Stanford and was pregnant. My Chinese patient had made
little booties for me. Things like that—
Adams:

Oh, very special.

Edgar:

—shewed the appreciation.

Mams:

Who were your faculty or administrative staff that you
remember and what kind of stories would you want to record
about them?

Edgar:

Well, I think my very favorite one was Miss Derihard,
because I did my senior work—and she was here today [at Nurse
Alumnae luncheon, where interview is taking place]—in OB, and
then my last six months I did half in the delivery room and
half on the floor. And then, of course, I became expectant—I
was married my last three months of school. She was very
supportive during that. In fact, she told me today, she said,
"I remember hew sick you were," (laughs) because I would be in
there very, very ill, and people would say, "Someone's sick in
there," and they'd say, "We knew who it is." (Laughs.) It was
a hard time. But I worked until I was a month due.

Adams:

Was there a time that you couldn't have been married, even
married, as a student nurse?

Edgar:

We had to get permission. New, one of the girls was just
in a year when she got married, but I was married just my last
three months. We had to go to the director, and he had to give
his permission. And I kept my room at Stanford so I could
sleep there. When I worked nights and had classes, I would
stay there. But it was hard, because trying to keep a husband

9

who was in school happy and—
Adams:

Did you continue to work in nursing after the birth of
your child?

Edgar:

When I finished, I first went over to St. Luke's in San
Francisco and worked there for about six months. And then
things looked better at Stanford, so I went back to Stanford
and worked until I had icy baby. Then I didn't work until we
moved down south after my husband graduated. Then I worked one
time about three months in order to pay for our baby (another
baby). Then I worked more or less just when iry husband could
be home. I'd work weekends or go in at seven. In those days
they needed nurses very badly.

Adams:

Still do, I gather.

Edgar:

Then I went back to school in '59 and got my public health
degree and became a school nurse.

Adams:

Do you still practice?

Edgar:

I've been twenty-two years in the same school district.

Adams:

Truly?

Edgar:

Yes.

Adams:

What's the most transparent excuse a student has ever
given to go to the nurse's office?

Edgar:

Oh. (Laughs.)

Adams:

You get them in all the time. Is this a high school?

Edgar:

No, I'm the only nurse in the district. I cover six
schools, and one is a junior high. The high school I don't go
to unless they need someone to be tested. But you get them
in—the ones that you get to know real well. They want to get

out of something. So you take their temperature, and there's
no temperature; then you send them back. You get all kinds of
characters in there. But we get some very serious things.
We've had two kids go through plate glass windows, and we get
broken legs and concussions, fractures. My main plague is
lice—we get lots of lice (laughs), which I had not seen in
training at all; I had to learn all that. They'll ask you to
come and look at a rash, and being that I'm the only nurse, I
can't run for everything. But I supervise everything. If they
have any questions, they call me.
What is the district where you work?
It's called Charter Oak. It's partly in Covina and partly
in Glendora, if you know southern California.
You had quite a trip up here today.
Yes.
Let's see. Let me get back to some of the school nursing,
the effects of the war. I'm assuming a nursing shortage
occurred after the war?
Very definitely. That's why we were used, I'd say, as
staff more than students, as soon as we were capped, because
they would give us four or five patients and expect us to have
them done. At that time we did the bath, we did the
medications and all the treatments, everything that was
involved with that.
Did you ever see, in the hospitals where you worked,
persons recuperating from war injuries? Or was it all done
through the V.A.?

No, no, I don't remember any of that. No. I do know that
Stanford would glean people from even out of state, because it
was a teaching hospital, and we saw a lot of things we would
not have seen in a smaller hospital. I can particularly
remember seeing babies that were not normal, and that was why I
probably didn't choose to work on pediatrics, because it was a
very hard place to work. I mean, they would be so pretty and
yet they would be like a vegetable. Just no brain at all. And
I think that was because I loved the children. They were very
special, really. I'd tell them stories and things like that.
What were the strengths and—if any—weaknesses of the
curriculum when you were trained—that is, that you discovered
when you went out in the field?
I think, because we had so many patients, we could not
concentrate on them as closely as I did after I went back to
graduate work. I went to City of Hope for part of my work, and
we would have one patient we could follow all of the lab work.
At Stanford, we would sometimes do what we call care studies,
and at that time we would look up everything about the
illnesses and follow through. But at City of Hope we would do
it with every patient; we had the time. And I think this is
the way nursing is now; they are not expected to do all the
work. I can remember one time going down to the Ice House to
get oxygen tanks, and, you know, it's pretty scary in the
darkness (laughs)—everything was on the night shift.
Was there any sort of student association where you would
have been able to register criticisms of your training?

12

Edgar:

Not that I remember. I can't remember being critical. We
had our class officers, and whether they had meetings with the
instructors, I'm not that familiar with what they did.

Adams:

Were there questions in ethics and values of nursing, or
is that something you picked up from the work?

Edgar:

I think we learned that in our probationary period. I had
two friends who went over to Cal and six of us that came to
Stanford. Discussing with them later, we felt that they did
not have as good training in patient care as we had. They were
trained more to be supervisors, where we were trained to give
good patient care. They were telling us things, "Comb their
hair and take care of their nails," and whatever they needed.
I think one of my biggest shocks was going over to Highland in
Oakland. We would have maybe ten patients, and they would say,
"Wash their face, change their bedspread and have them ready by
nine." It was just horrible. And that was in a communicable
disease ward. So we realized there was a big difference in
what we learned. But I think we were taught very good patient
care.

Adams:

What about the nurse's role in the overall medical team,
including the physician care?

Edgar:

Well, I think in our day, we looked up to the physician
more than they do now. His word was law, and I don't think we
offered many suggestions. We were more or less carrying out
orders that they gave us? whereas new I get the younger
graduates. It does happen that they tell off the doctor. We
were taught to stand when they came into a room.

Did you ever observe any situations as a practicing nurse
or student where you felt a mistake was being made?
Not at Stanford, but I certainly did as a graduate—there
were doctors that I didn't feel were doing the job they should.
Was there any provision for nurses to be able to act on
this?
I think all we could do was to refer to our supervisor.
For instance, if a dosage was something we didn't think they
should have, we could call, and our supervisor made that
decision.
And that was an ethical responsibility that you had?
Yes. But I don't remember any cases at Stanford. I think
that the doctors were very fine and—that I can recall.
I don't mean to suggest that nursing isn't in itself a
positive decision, but had you ever thought of being a doctor?
No, not a doctor. I remember just before training, they
were putting in a big drive for teachers, and I weighed it at
the time: should I, after all these years, change; and then I
decided to go on with the nursing.
Well, in public health nursing, you get to teach.
Not much with my job, because I just have too big a load
to do teaching. But a lot of school nurses do.
You could work with families and. . . .
Right. Oh, yes, I do a lot of that. Teachers sometimes
ask me questions that they couldn't handle. Parents will ask
my advice, but I don't do a lot of teaching. But some of the
girls have done a lot of that.

14

Do you remember the first death that had an impact on you?
Yes, yes. Well, I would say the one that really
frightened me the most was when we went in to observe an
autopsy. He had died of cancer of the pancreas. He was
jaundiced all over, and I remember feeling very, very ill at
that time.
Were you pregnant then?
No, not at that time. That was early in training that we
saw that. But, other than that, I know we did lose them on the
ward. Of course, it was always hard, especially when you
wouldn't expect it. But there weren't a lot that I can recall.
Do you remember an experience that sticks in your mind
that you said, "This is why I'm a nurse; this is why I did it"?
Well, I think, when you feel you've done a good job you
feel that. I think even the occasion of those three fellows
going together and getting me something for the dance really
meant a lot to me, that they thought enough of me to do that.
And there were many occasions where they were very
appreciative.
What are your memories of the state board examinations?
Okay! (Laughs.) Well, I had just got married, and I had
my first job, and studied while I was at work or at dinner
hour. I think ours was a two-and-a-half-day test, and many of
us here took them together because we were still in the San
Francisco area. But I remember them being very difficult.
Did you study?
Oh, yes, I tried studying. We had a Colhansen's[?] review

15

of nursing, and we did look over things, but there was so much
material that, unless you really have it in your mind. . . .
Mams:

Was any of it practiced, or was it all written test?

Edgar:

It was all written. It was not practical.

Mams:

When you look back at your autobiographical piece that you
wrote before entrance, are you surprised by the girl that you
were then?

Edgar:

Well, I was kind of amused. I hadn't remembered it. My
folks had it in the picture album, and I hadn't seen the album
to even knew then that I wanted to be a public health nurse.
But I had read the Sue Barton books before I went into
training, and just dearly loved those. I think that explains
why I wanted to go. But other than that, I more or less told
of my childhood and my experiences and about my family and
trips that we took and especially New York in '39, seeing the
Bronx.

Mams:

Different from Pasadena.

Edgar:

Yes—where you saw the tenements and things like that. It
was very impressive. I loved the public health part of
training. As graduates we had about three months of public
health, so we could go out. I also worked a little on
VNA—visiting nurse—so I did get that experience.

Adams:

Did you feel well prepared by your education?

Edgar:

I think for the most part. The only thing I would say
about Stanford that I felt as I got into a private hospital, is
that because we had interns and residents and a teaching
hospital, we did not learn hew to start IVs or do the rectal

16

exams or some other things, like delivery, which other nurses
knew how to do. So that would be probably my only comment.
Otherwise, I think we were well prepared, because you had to
have so many deliveries, so many surgeries and so many
different procedures before they would count that you were
ready to do them on your own.
Adams:

I was surprised to hear that there was a really close
accounting of the days that you were there; if you had a week
over the prescribed sick leave, you had to make up that time or
you couldn't graduate with your class.

Edgar:

Well, I was very healthy. (Laughs.) I did graduate a
week late, because I took my honeymoon, and so I was a week
later than some of the girls. They didn't count that for my
sick leave, but I think I only had one sick leave in the three
years, and I think that was when I was working in the nursery
and had diarrhea and I couldn't go on. And I've been healthy
as a school nurse.

Adams:

You haven't gotten measles or mumps?

Edgar:

No, I got measles when my little girl got measles.
(Laughs.) But I've been very fortunate.

Adams:

Did any of your children go into the medical profession?

Edgar:

Both my daughters are R.N. 's.

Adams:

Oh, yes?

Edgar:

One is a missionary.

Adams:

Where is she?

Edgar:

Well, she had been in Mexico, but Witnesses [Jehovah's
Witnesses] [?] are not allowed to be down there any length of

17

time, so they work out of Tuscon, Arizona, and the villagers
come up and work with them. What they do is they learn to
translate; they learn the person's language, write it down, and
then they translate it into the Bible for them. But she works
in the summer; they have a summer institute where the students
take language courses. Then she always works with the clinic
nurse there. So, it was mother, grandmother and daughter. . .

Adams:

Three generations.

Edgar:

My daughter-in-law is an R.N., too.

Name TK;

When you talked to your mother after you graduated, when
you got into service, what differences did she see, talk about?

Edgar:

Oh, it was quite different. In her day, they would work
twelve hours, and I think they did mainly private duty, which
we did not have much at all. I did more of that as a graduate.

Adams:

Is private duty where you would be in a person's home, or
would they be a private patient in the hospital?

Edgar:

No, that was done in the hospital.

Adams:

So you'd be just their nurse?

Edgar:

Yes. That's my recollection of what she did. Now I know
in France that she really did a lot of care there in the wards,
where the men were injured.

Adams:

How much did she talk about her war experience?

Edgar:

Some, but not a lot. But then, after she passed away, I
found a diary which she had written in France, and it was very
interesting, because her best friend died of the flu, that big
flu epidemic. I should read it again; I read it right after

18

she passed away, which has been over twenty years now.
Adams:

That would be powerful.

Edgar:

Yeah.

Adams:

I'll bet that was very interesting. What changes have you
seen during your career?

Edgar:

Well, I haven't worked in the hospital for about ten,
fifteen years now, but from just seeing other nurses, I think
they are more on a student basis. They would be maybe assigned
to two patients. When I went back to school, you spent more
detailed time with a patient. You would write your care plan,
they called it, with the plan for the best care for the
patient. I think all hospitals are doing that now. At least,
when I was still working, they started to bring that in, to
have us think about what care the patient needed. So that was
different. But it's been a lot different since I first worked,
because we didn't have ward clerks, we didn't have a lot of the
help they do now. We were with patients more, I think.

Name TK;

If you had the time or the inclination to do something
different in nursing than that which you do now, what might
that be?

Edgar:

Well, I always thought I wouldn't like anything better
than staff nursing, but I love school nursing. (Laughs.) But
it isn't much nursing really. Oh, I test the children and we
do scoliosis screenings. I look through a lot of people's hair
for lice. I look at rashes. But we're not allowed to give any
medication. It's more of a counselor role: talking to the
kids and trying to make decisions, a lot of decisions, whether

something's really serious or not, with head injuries
particularly. But I always enjoyed the staff nursing. I'd be
leery about going back new without further training, because
there are so many machines and so many things that they've
added since we were there? like, we never had dialysis and
these heart monitors they follow now.
Do you go through the continuing education course work?
Yes. You have to take thirty hours every two years to
keep your R.N. And I do that a lot through school nursing
symposia? I attend those. Then we have a little psychiatric
hospital in the Charter Oak area, and about once a month they
have special speakers. It's usually related issues, like drugs
or things like that, that would be interesting to me as a
school nurse, so I try to relate what I do to that.
What about AIDS and its impact on school-age children?
Well, at first we have had none that I know of in the
district, but of course it was a very frightening experience,
because we have one school that has children from what we call
Masonic[?] Home, and they have a lot of abused children that
have been placed in there. They were quite worried. I did
attend as many classes as I could on AIDS, and we got rubber
gloves to wear when we were handling any cuts or anything that
would be a danger. But we don't know everything about it? all
we can do is take good precautions. I think a lot of people
are very, very frightened.
Was there any formal educational programming for your
school nurses?

Edgar:

No. I had written a directive hew I thought we should
wash any blood down with dhlorox solution; that was supposed to
destroy the virus.

Mams:

What do you see as some of the most pressing concerns for
public health nursing, school nursing, family health care?

Edgar:

Oh, I think everything has changed since I went to
school. I think the biggest concern is about latch key
children. There are so many that we can't even get hold of the
parents when it is necessary. We had a little girl this week
with 103 temperature, and so all I did was pack her in ice and
just try to. . . .

[END OF SIDE A]

[START OF SIDE B]
Edgar:

And also, of course, they've been getting into sex so
young, and drugs. I don't see a lot of that, not being in high
school, but there is some in the junior high. I don't see as
much in the elementary yet, hopefully not.

Adams:

What about situations of abuse, where you're required to
report the incident?

Edgar:

Yes, we see some of that, but not a lot. I had one this
week that they felt was probably a case. I think they went out
and took the children with them to make an identification. But
the child's right back in the home, and it's not as good as
you'd like it to be. And it may be, too, that if we had
parents from another culture, that they are taught to
discipline their children differently than we are. I spanked

my child and sometimes left marks on her; maybe I would have
been gotten for abuse, too.
But there are some definite cases where they had been
sexually abused arid more or less beaten. The child sometimes
will not tell you the truth, but will sometimes share it with
somebody they trust. But usually I'm called in, and I examine
the child in the presence of someone else and see what kind of
bruises we find, and I make a report of it. The police
officers are called in and they question the child. If they
feel it is an abuse case, they will go out to the home.
Adams:

Do you get to follow through? I would imagine you see so
many children that you don't get to follow through on their
lives.

Edgar:

Sometimes I try to remember to do it. In a case like
that, I may call and say, "What happened to so-and-so? Was
that really a head injury?" if I can; or sometimes they will
call me. But as far as knowing the children, some I have
followed quite closely, because they've been in since I've
started. Some of them are long gone.

We have special

education, too, and those children I seem to know better,
because I am involved in their placement. I have to see their
eyes and ears and other health aspects. So with those I have
followed through. Some you know because they're in your office
a lot. (Laughs.)
Adams:

When the Stanford School of Nursing closed, what was your
response, feelings?

Edgar:

Oh, I was very, very sad, of course, because I thought it

22

was a fine school of nursing. But, as they said today at the
luncheon, I think they're going to the two-year program a lot,
and/or the degree program. I don't think that the diploma
programs, which were the three-year programs, are going to be
in existence, or are even. But I think the two-year program is
a good program, from what I can observe in working with them.
I don't think they have as much patient care as we did. They
do very well on state boards. I don't know what the difference
is. I think being a good nurse is within you. I've seen
nurses aides that were just super, that were just really fine.
They knew what they were doing.
Name TK;

What would you say to a young man or woman interested in
going into nursing, in terms of giving them a dose of reality
as well as a pep talk, maybe?

Edgar:

Well, I feel it's a terrific preparation for being a
mother, and I think that was what I saw in my mother, hew she
handled different things. I was burned very badly as a child,
I caught on fire, and she handled that on her own. I was the
kind that was always falling out of trees, and she remained so
patient with things. I think that's one thing you do learn. I
can even see it at school: people get real hysterical about
someone, and I usually wash them off and find out really what
the extent of the injury is. That would be probably one of the
greatest benefits, as far as your own family.
I think it's not as lucrative as some other jobs are, but
as far as a school nurse, I make the same salary as the
teachers do. Of course, there's lot of other things that would

23

make a lot more.
For me it was very good because, while my children were
growing up, I could work any hours; the schools were always so
anxious to have someone. I could go in at seven and work 'til
eleven, or I could work Saturdays, Sundays, whatever I wanted
to, or vacations, when my husband would be home. That was a
very big plus for me, whereas another job I couldn't have done
that.
Mams:

So you had that kind of flexibility, it improved your
response to emergencies.

Edgar:

Right, definitely.

Mams:

It enriched your family life.

Edgar:

Right.

Mams:

Any particular role models other than the book that you
were reading, Sue Barton? (Laughs.) No one's mentioned
Florence Nightingale.

Edgar:

Oh. (Laughs.)

Adams:

I guess Florence was in an earlier era.

Edgar:

Well, we took the Nightingale pledge at our capping. I
don't think I'd read any books on her since I was very young.
I knew about her and everything, but I was more into Sue
Barton. And then my own mother. But I think there have been
many nurses that I've admired very greatly, that I felt like
I'd like to be like.

Adams:

A lot of times that person is someone you don't remember
the name of, but a particularly compassionate person. Is there
anything I haven't asked you about something that you'd like to

24

talk about?
Edgar:

You've done a very fine job of covering and remembering.
As I've said, it's been a very special time in my life, and I'm
very thankful that I had the experience. I love my job now; I
couldn't think of anything I'd rather be doing.
