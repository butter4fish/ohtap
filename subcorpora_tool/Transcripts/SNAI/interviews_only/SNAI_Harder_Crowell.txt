Adams:

We will just see how this goes, answering questions together
and filling in each other, if you'd like. I guess the first
question we're interested in is why women became nurses. What
was the motivation? Was it a family member who convinced you?

Crowell:

I decided to be a nurse when I was ten years old. My mother
was horrified, my father went along with my mother. Nurses were
not what they had in mind for their daughter, sort of the bottom
of the totem pole, as icy mother said. "What do you want to be a
nurse for? If you're going to go through training, why don't you
became a doctor?" No, I didn't want to be a doctor, I wanted to
be a nurse. I could always be a nurse, even if I married and had
children, but I wasn't sure I could be a doctor if I married and
had children. This was, after all, . . .

I graduated in '48.

I never wavered and I never regretted it. I loved it.
Adams:

Was there a nurse in your experience who was a role model?

Crowell:

No. There were doctors in my family. My grandfather had
been a doctor, there was a cousin my age who was a doctor, and I
told him I'd be his nurse. He became a doctor and I became a
nurse.

Adams:

Did you became his nurse?

Crowell:

No, no. He was in Cuba.

Adams:

What about your motivations?

Harder:

Well, I can't remember ever wanting to be anything but a

nurse, but I think probably it happened because, when I was four,
five, or six years old, we had a lot of illness in the family, so
I had a lot of exposure to hospitals. Although I think I was
probably only in the hospital two or three times, I was very
fascinated by the whole thing.
Adams:

Did you ever consider being a doctor?

Harder:

No. If memory serves me, women's careers were teachers,
nurses, or secretaries, and I wanted to go to college. I didn't
think that secretaries needed to go to college. At least the
very few women I knew who were secretaries didn't have much
education beyond high school. My father wanted me to be a
teacher. I have a sister who's a teacher, but I didn't want to
be a teacher. No, I've never regretted it either. I can't
imagine anything that I would have enjoyed more, or gotten more
benefit out. I felt that no matter what I did, my nursing
education would be a benefit to me.

Adams:

Can you describe your pre-nursing education?

Crowell:

Well, I went to San Jose State, I had two years there, and
then I was admitted to Stanford. Shall I tell you new why I
chose Stanford?

Adams:

Yes, why did you choose Stanford?

Crowell:

There was a pre-nursing club at San Jose State, and the
advisor was a Stanford grad, but she was fairly neutral. She
didn't push Stanford over Cal, and she took the club as a group
on a tour. Took us both to Stanford and to Cal, and when I saw
those crazy caps that they wore at Cal, I said, "I'm going to go

3

to Stanford," and that was it.
Adams:

Describe these caps.

Crowell:

They were like mortarboards, they were white mortarboards,
and they were sappy looking. I just thought they were
ridiculous. I said, "Oh, gosh, Stanford must have a better cap
than that." And, of course, they did. That's what decided me.

Adams:

OK. Hew do caps get designed? What is the historical
background? I always thought that nurses' caps were all sort of
the standard little things.

Crowell:

I used to think they were souffle cups, because the Eastern
nurses . . ., and when you see pictures of old nurses, they
always have the souffle cup. If you watch TV shews of the olden
times, I think it came actually from head coverings. Women
always covered their heads. And from the bonnets and caps. Each
school somehow chose some distinctive cap to set them off.

Adams:

Berkeley had a distinctive cap.

Crowell:

We were terribly proud of our caps. Capping day was a big
day in training, that you look forward to. New I understand that
nobody wears caps any more. They've done away with a good thing,
I think.

Harder:

Well, in baccalaureate programs, they don't work their way
through school, like we did.

Adams:

Tell me about your pre-nursing education and why you came to
Stanford.

Harder:

Well, I lived in Sacramento and I went to what was then
Sacramento Junior College for the two years prior to going in to

4

Stanford. The reason I went to Stanford, as best I can remember,
is that was where my mother told me I was going. There was some
discussion about going to Merritt Hospital. Merritt had a
three-year nursing program which was, I think, a good one. There
was one or two people that I went to junior college with who were
going into nursing and who went to Merritt. But, in later years,
when I asked my mother why she chose Stanford, other than the
fact we had an acquaintance who was in the class of '45, a few
years behind us, she said that she knew that the baccalaureate
program was superior to the three-year program. Since this
friend had come to Stanford, that's where I would go.
Adams:

In the pre-nursing education, what kinds of coursework did
you take? Biological sciences, mathematics?

Harder:

Anatomy, physiology, . . .

Crowell:

Chemistry.

Harder:

Chemistry.

Crowell:

Bacteriology. We had very few electives, because there
wasn't any room for them. We had . . .

Adams:

It was a two-year program?

Crcwell:

Psychology was required. Philosophy was . . .

Harder:

Elective.

Adams:

Was it philosophy of nursing?

Crowell:

Well, no.

Harder:

Philosophy was just a basic course.

Crcwell:

I took Spanish as one of my electives, but otherwise there
was really very little room for electives, because the rest were

5

pre-nursing courses, and there were required subjects.
Adams:

Tell me a bit about the different programs: the
baccalaureate and the shorter program. What degree would you
have gotten in a shorter program?

Harder:

Well, if I remember correctly, the main difference was that
the nurses in the three-year program went directly to some
hospital, . . .

Crowell:

. . . from high school.

Harder:

From high school.

Crcwell:

Without college.

Harder:

Without college, and whatever courses they took, they took
there at the hospital.

Crowell:

Yes, and it was all nursing.

Harder:

There were no regular academic courses.

Adams:

It was more clinical? Did you get more or less clinical
experience in the baccalaureate program?

Harder:

I would say we had less clinical experience.

Adams:

You think so?

Harder:

Well, we spent three years at the hospital.

Crowell:

Oh, that's right, we did have three years, that's true. So
we actually had five years to get a nursing degree.

Adams:

Including your pre-nursing?

Crowell:

But the nursing degree also included the Bachelor of Arts.

Harder:

Science. We got a Bachelor of Science.

Crowell:

No, we didn't.

Harder:

I thought we did. I thought we got a B.S.

6

Crowell:

We'll check.

Adams:

What if you had stopped at the end of the pre-nursing years,
of the two years of junior college?

Crowell:

You'd be a graduate of a junior college, with an Associate
of Arts degree.

Adams:

Nov/ does this state have, or did it have LFNs?

Crowell:

No, in those days they didn't have anything like that. I
had good friends who just went from high school, right into a
three-year nursing school. There was one in San Jose,
O'Connor's, which was a Catholic, sister-run hospital. When they
graduated they had to take the exam and they became KNs. But
they didn't have any other degree. We had our college degree and
then took the exam and had the EN. There were only two schools
in the whole state, Stanford and the University of California at
Berkeley, that gave that five-year degree. None of the other
colleges had nursing courses. They were the only two.

Harder:

I didn't realize that.

Adams:

Was there a differential in pay for you as a new graduate?

Crowell:

No. Absolutely not. On one of my jobs I was paid ten
dollars a month more because I was considered an expert, because
I had been in the field a certain number of years. I don't knew
what decided that. They never really said, but my starting
salary at that hospital was ten dollars a month more.

Adams:

But it was based on experience rather than education?

Crowell:

It was based on the fact that I'd been in maternity for a
certain number of years.

Adams:

What do you remember of your first day at nursing school? I
mean, a description of what the school was like, and your
roommates.

Harder:

Well, I had a tour. The only time I was at the facility at
all was a couple of months before we actually entered, to have my
physical, and it was done at the nursing school, which was right
across the street from the hospital. So I saw the outside, but I
didn't see the inside.

Adams:

And they saw your insides, too.

Harder:

I don't know. The main thing I remember is my mother and I
going up to my room, and while we were waiting in the lobby there
at the elevator, this very bouncy girl coming up to me and
saying, "Oh, are you Virginia Harder? I'm going to be your
roommate." I don't know whether this happened to you when you
went into training, but the residence was very crowded when we
went in, because there were nurses who had extra time beyond
their class's graduation to fill in, and so for about six months
they couldn't let us have our own rooms. So they doubled us up.

Adams:

It was unusual to have a roommate?

Crowell:

Yes, it was unusual to have a roommate.

Harder:

It was unusual to have a roommate, and so my class had to
double up. And I had never seen this girl before.

Crowell:

And you doubled up in a single room.

Harder:

Yes. It was what was a single room, and we got along very
fine. One of the first things I remember that she said when we
were finally alone in the room together, when we kind of looked

8

at one another. I didn't realize it right away that she was
thinking exactly the same thing I was thinking: do you smoke? We
were both very pleased to find out that the other one did not
smoke.
Mams:

Did you both smoke? You did not smoke? Did you take your
meals in the residence there?

Harder:

They weren't in the residence, we ate in the hospital.
There was a nurses' dining room. On the fifth floor?

Crowell:

On the fourth floor of the old building. We had to go in
through the lobby of the old building and up the elevator, and
you were never allowed in there in uniform unless you were on
duty. You never were supposed to be going anywhere near the
hospital when you're off duty in uniform, because if a doctor saw
you, he could call on you to help him if there was an emergency.
If you weren't assigned to the place, you shouldn't be in there.
If you went to visit anyone in the hospital, you were not to be
in uniform. I remember that rule.

Adams:

Was this the first time that you were away from home?

Harder:

Yes.

Crowell:

Yes. I wasn't very far. I was only fifty miles away and I
went home every day off I had. My mother called me every
Wednesday, or I called her, and my little heart would get a
little lump in my throat I had to talk through. I was homesick
for a long time.

Adams:

How about you? What was your experience?

Harder:

I wasn't homesick. Sacramento was really a very provincial

town, and I lived out in the country, and I could just hardly
wait to get to the big city. There were times, you know, when I
wished I could be with my family, but things worked out as far as
holidays. I think there was only about one Christmas in the
three years that I was there that I wasn't able to go home. I
went home about, every other, every third weekend. I think there
was only one time when there was a six week span that I didn't go
home for one reason or another. But my family came down to see
me. My parents would come down and spend the weekend or
something. I liked school. My father was very generous with
money, as far as social life was concerned. And gee, to be able
to go to the opera and the symphony! Remember how the doctors
used to drop the tickets off at the switchboard of the nurses'
residence if they couldn't go? You'd find yourself sitting in
the orchestra at the opera house. No, I thought it was just
great.
Adams:

Did you each have big sisters assigned?

Crowell:

Yes.

Harder:

Yes.

Adams:

What was the function of the big sister? Was it more to
socialize you or did you study with them?

Crowell:

We didn't study with them.

Harder:

It was just somebody to go if you needed some help.

Crowell:

To go to if you had trouble, but I never did, did you?

Harder:

No. I just used whoever was around, if I had to ask, "What
do you do? When?", that kind of thing. Looking back on it, I

10

liken that kind of nursing education to being in the Army, or in
the service. When you're together with a bunch of people, you
live with them, you do essentially the same things, the same
expectations, and you're just together all the time. I thought
it was a terrific support system in and of itself.
Crowell:

I was terribly frightened when I went on duty. I wasn't
self confident. I can remember my hands being ice-cold and my
heart up in my throat for a long, long time. Every time I went
across the street to the hospital, it was the same feeling. I'd
look around at my classmates, and the first day we went over, we
went over as a group. The first day we were in uniform, we had
very limp, white aprons, because they hadn't been starched.

Adams:

I was going to say, I remember them as being starchy.

Crowell:

After you've starched something over and over, it builds up
apparently, and then it stood out.

Adams:

Like the Flying Nun?

Crowell:

They ruined our white stockings, remember? Our starched
aprons were rubbing against our white stockings and snagging them
terribly. I remember going over and everybody being very
nervous. Within a couple of days, nobody else was nervous, so I
never admitted that I was nervous, but I was.

Adams:

I suspect they may have also been nervous.

Crowell:

They may have been, too.

Adams:

What kind of responsibilities did you have as student
nurses? There must have been things you couldn't do.

Harder:

Well, as probies, for the first five months that we were

11

there, we were pretty closely supervised in virtually everything.
Crowell:

Yes, yes.

Harder:

After we were capped, that was not the case.

Crowell:

After we were capped we practically staffed the hospital.
And I can remember my first assignment. It may have been after I
was capped or it may even have been before, but it was a private
floor, a floor on the private side of the hospital. There were
four students on duty and the head nurse, and she said, "Before
the war, I would have had eight graduate nurses show up for
morning." And she had four student nurses. So I thought the
responsibility was really tremendous.

Adams:

What was the impact of the war on your class?

Harder:

Well, my class came in in '46. The war was still on.

Crowell:

When I was admitted, the war was still on and the cadet
corps was going strong. I never could have gotten into Stanford
if it hadn't been for the nurse corps because my father was
retired and he couldn't afford to send me.

Adams:

What was the cadet corps?

Crowell:

The cadet corps paid all our expenses; it paid our tuition,
and it gave us, the first six months, fifteen dollars a month.
The second year I think it was twenty dollars, and it went up in
the third year of training to thirty dollars a month income from
the cadet corps, plus tuition. By the time my class came in,
they had a student uniform, a cadet nurse uniform. That lasted
about six months, because when my class was admitted, the cadet
corps was no longer providing the uniform. The war was just

12

over. The war ended in August and we started training in
September. Of all the class, and there were thirty-seven in the
class, two, I remember, did not join the cadet corps. All you
had to promise, when you joined the cadet corps, was that you
would stay in nursing, essential nursing, for the duration of the
war plus six months. Well, the war was over. But, of course,
the war isn't over until the peace is signed, and it doesn't mean
the cessation of fighting, it means peace. I don't know exactly
when they did sign that. But you were technically supposed to
have stayed in nursing after the end of that. And, of course, we
were still in training.
Adams:

But you weren't in a branch of the military, you weren't
expected to be in a branch of the military?

Crowell:

No. Just essential nursing, and the only thing that was not
considered essential nursing was working in a doctor's office.

Adams:

I was going to ask you, then, if pediatrics was essential
nursing?

Crowell:

Yes. Any kind of hospital nursing, and even, I think,
industrial nursing. I'm not sure about that. But nursing is
essential. I couldn't see any disadvantage to joining the nurse
corps. You didn't sign away anything.

Adams:

Were you involved in the nurse corps?

Harder:

No, because that was no longer operating

Crowell:

And we were the last class.

Harder:

We entered in '46. They were the last class. I think the
impact it had on our class was the fact that there were fewer of

13

us. How many did you say?
Crowell:

We were thirty-seven in our class.

Harder:

There were twenty-three that went in in my class.

Crowell:

Well, now, for instance, I also think that the class of '48,
was the last class that had two sections. Did '49 have two
sections?

Harder:

'49 had two sections.

Crowell:

'48 Section I entered in January or February, and they had
only twenty-one, I think, in the class. Then section two which
started in September had thirty-seven. But then, by the time you
came along, you were the class of . . .

Harder:

The class of '49 Section I entered in January or February of
'46. There were eight in that first section, and then there were
twenty-three of us.

Mams:

What accounted for the smaller number?

Harder:

Well, I think the fact that . . .

Crowell:

The war was over.

Harder:

. . . the war was over.

Crowell:

I'm sure that there were a lot of girls who would have gone
to some other course that was cheaper, because Stanford, even
then, was expensive. I don't remember what tuition was, probably
$1000 a year.

Harder:

We've got to find out somewhere along the line what the
tuition was, because I've often wondered. I even went back
through some diaries of my mother's to try to find out what it
was, and there was only one item in there that said anything

about any money paid to Stanford, and that was $600. It didn't
say what it was for. And I thought, that three years must have
cost my father more than $600.
Crowell:

We had to pay for uniforms, and laundry and books. Did you
pay for your laundry?

Harder:

It was never anything that was even discussed with me. My
parents took care of all of that. I was a babe.

Adams:

Would it have been possible to do other work to put yourself
through nursing school, or was the schedule so rigorous that you
couldn't?

Harder:

We went to school, we were there eleven months of the year.
We had one month off in the summer.

Crowell:

And when we first started, we had one day off a week, and
four hours on a holiday, not necessarily on the holiday, but four
hours for the holiday. That was the big shock to me, when I
went. I knew the pay was low. Well, of course, as a student,
you don't get paid, but I knew that as a graduate I wouldn't make
much money. But what shocked me, appalled me, was that we were
on duty eight and a half hours. And I said, "That's eight and a
half hours." They said, "Oh, no, half an hour's for lunch." I
thought, "Good heavens. You mean I'm going to have to work eight
and a half hours so I can have a half hour for lunch?" Yes, it
was either seven to three-thirty, or it was seven to eleven, and
three to seven, or two-thirty to seven, because you'd have to go
for your suppertime.

Adams:

Were there student nurse associations where you might

15

discuss in a formal way issues that came before you as students,
like a student council where you could have gone to the
administration and said, "We want something changed."
Crcwell:

No. I don't remember any.

Harder:

We had a class president.

Crowell:

An honor board.

Harder:

. . . and an honor board and something like that, but I
don't remember. I was terribly naive, about a lot of things. I
wandered in there and said, "Just tell me what to do, and I'll do
it." They liked me. I felt that was probably one of my greatest
strengths, as far as getting into the place. Because the few
times that I was even vaguely aware that there were some of the
students who were making waves, I thought, gee, you shouldn't do
that. There was some sort of a loose organization of some kind.
No, it wasn't anything that you could take concerns about hours
and all this kind of thing.

Adams:

Looking back, what issues might you have made waves about if
you were a wavemaker?

Harder:

This would have to be in retrospect because I wasn't even
smart enough to think about it at the time. I guess I would have
wanted a clearer understanding of what our rights were, given the
fact that we were working all three shifts, staffing the clinic
side of the hospital. I remember a friend not connected with
nursing one time being, not horrified, but really terribly
surprised when I mentioned that I gave morphine to people. He
couldn't understand how I could do that when I was only a

16

student. And I said, "Well, the doctor wrote the order, 'Every
four hours as needed' so they need it, you give it to them." We
were nineteen, twenty, twenty-one year old girls still in school,
and we were, you know, the only night nurse on the floor,
responsible for twenty-some people.
Adams:

Was this because of the economics of the time, the shortage
of nurses after the war, or the way it had always been?

Crowell:

Oh, I think the fact that we staffed the hospital was
because of the nursing shortage. We just did not have the
graduate nurses.

Harder:

And maybe a way of keeping the expenses of the nursing
school down.

Crowell:

Yes.

Harder:

Because they didn't have to pay graduates.

Crowell:

They didn't pay us.

Harder:

Yes. I remember being very upset one morning, being chewed
out by the daytime supervisor because I had not called the
nursing office at five or a little after five. I was working
nights, and the young man who was supposed to come—this was on
men's surgical ward—to help me open up the ward for the morning
didn't show up. I was so busy trying to get everything done,
that when he didn't come, I thought, "Well, he didn't come." So,
at seven o'clock, when the day shift got there and everything and
I was about to go off duty, well, she didn't bawl me out, but she
said, "Miss Bennet, we never expect a nurse to open up a ward
this size by herself. Why didn't you call the office?" And it

17

frankly never occurred to me that that was the thing to do. But
I was upset because I didn't know that that was their
expectation.
Crowell:

And you did the best you could.

Adams:

Who was the dean? What was the faculty and administrative
structure like? What faculty do you remember?

Crowell:

There was one, we called her the "probie pusher," and she
was a graduate of Johns Hopkins. She had a "cup cap." She had a
starched front to her uniform that she attached to the "prowler"
and to the waist, and it bulged over her bosom. She was very
stern, but she was just mush underneath. We discovered that
starched thing that she added was to keep us off her, somehow.

Adams:

Do you remember her name?

Crowell:

Mrs. Ericson. We all loved her.

Harder:

She was great.

Crowell:

She was a wonderful, wonderful person. Very stern.

Adams:

What was her responsibility?

Crowell:

She was the one who taught us how to make a bed and taught
us everything about nursing arts. She had two senior students
who were her helpers, and they were seniors. They were
third-year students who were also very sweet, very nice. But
they didn't even pretend to be stern. She pretended at least.
She was wonderful. And she took us on the ward and stayed with
us. Well, I think the first week or so we didn't even go on the
ward; we had this practice ward where she taught us how to make
beds and how to lift patients in and out of bed and into the

18

wheelchair and all that. Then, after a week or so, she must have
taken a whole bunch of us over. Then she left a few in each
ward. Each one of us was very well supervised.
Harder:

I think maybe the senior students must have had part of it,
because I . . .

Crowell:

Maybe they broke us into three groups.

Harder:

Something like that. I don't quite remember. I remember
the first time we went on the ward being assigned to clean.

Crowell:

And we dusted.

Harder:

Yes. All that kind of stuff. We were maids.

Crowell:

We relined the shelves and folded the linen and sort of got
used to the idea of being on a ward, or on a floor. But we were
never left alone. And every procedure that we ever did, every
new thing we did had to be supervised. Putting a patient on the
bedpan, taking the patient off the bedpan, everything was
supervised.

Adams:

Did you have classroom sessions as well?

Crowell:

Yes. And the supervisor of the department would give us the
nursing classes. The maternity supervisor gave us the nursing
classes for maternity, delivery room, then you were on nursery.
There'd be a doctor who would give us classes on the medical
aspect of it. And some of those doctors weren't very good
teachers, if I remember correctly. But all that time was
considered class time, and that was not included. You could work
an eight hour day plus maybe a couple of hours of classes.

[END OF SIDE A]

19

[BEGINNING OF SIDE B]
Crowell:

We had to make up time lost. I remember in one two week
period, I made up twenty-six hours of overtime, then I got three
days off, so that was nice.

Harder:

I do remember one time particularly, because I slept through
the alarm or forgot to set the alarm. I was working nights and
sleeping during the day, and I was supposed to be at a class a
one o'clock in the afternoon or something like that, and then I
got this call in my room, it woke me up. "Where was I?" So I
had to put on that hat and a coat and went down to the classroom
and sat through the rest of it.

Crowell:

That's really where you made up your real overtime, when you
were on the evening and the night shifts, because in the daytime,
if they knew you had a class from one to two, you could be
scheduled around it. But on the evening shift and the night
shift they couldn't make it up to you.

Mams:

Who else do you remember on the teaching staff or
administration, while you were a student?

Harder:

Well, of course, Miss Ringressy was the nursing director and
the head of it.

Crowell:

Remember Miss Heitman?

Harder:

Yes, I remember. And you know, I'm not really clear, in
looking back on it, what their titles were. I thought that Miss
Ringressy was both the head of the nursing school and the nursing
director of the hospital, so was I mistaken about that?

20

Crowell:

I thought she was the director of the nursing school, which
made her the head nurse, I mean, the top nurse in the hospital.
Miss Heitman was her assistant, I thought.

Harder:

Because I thought that Miss Heitman had more to do with the
nursing school, per se. But that's just an impression.

Mams:

What kind of contacts did you have with her?

Harder:

Not really an awful lot.

Crowell:

Not unless you got into trouble.

Harder:

Not unless you got into trouble which I tried very hard to
stay out of. I remember very little about Miss Heitman. I can
kind of picture her.

Crowell:

Yes. She would come around and take the reports. In the
daytime, she would take the reports from the head nurses. And
she was the one who called me on the carpet because I lost
somebody's clothes one time. He was ready to go home and where
were his clothes and Miss McCuthson[?] on duty. She raked me
over the coals over that. I did lose his clothes. Somebody else
cheated him. They gave them to somebody else and he wore them
home. But anyway, she was very stern. She'd been a major in the
army, and boy, she liked to click the heels and have everybody
snap to. Otherwise, you didn't see much of her, as a student
nurse.

Harder:

There was Sally, what was her name. She was a graduate, a
teacher.

Crowell:

Not Sally Burbank? She had been one of our probie pushers.

Harder:

That could have been it.

21

Adams:

Why a probie pusher? Because you're being propelled?

Harder:

I think that's it.

Crowell:

They push the probies. That must have been it.

Adams:

So you're a probie for the first . . .

Crowell:

Six months, without hats.

Adams:

And then you get capped.

Crowell:

And then we got capped and you couldn't tell the
difference. Once you were capped, there was nothing on your
uniform to distinguish a first-year student from a senior.

Adams:

So you could have been called upon to do things you really
weren't prepared to do.

Crowell:

Yes. But of course, if you were, then you could say, "I've
never done that." But there was no way the doctors could tell by
looking at you what class you were in. There were some schools
where they'd have a stripe on the cap or something to indicate
that it was first-year, second-year, or third-year. But not us.

Adams:

Do you remember any particularly traumatic experiences,
during probationary period or during your training, that stick in
your mind?

Harder:

I remember a couple, not so much when I was a probie. I
can't remember that I was frightened so much. I was
apprehensive, but I do remember being very embarrassed the first
time I saw a patient throw up.

Crowell:

I was just about to say the same thing.

Harder:

And I thought that I was hiding it very well, because I was
kind of standing toward the back of the group. But whoever the

nurse was who was with us said something to me that made me
realize that she had seen me. I was just mortified. Yes, I was
apprehensive the first time I worked nights alone. The whole
experience on pediatrics was rather difficult for me. I liked
it, but you may remember that we had a doctor there who was doing
research on a new drug for leukemia, so we all those kids in
there with leukemia, that died off one by one. I found that
very, very difficult to take. One time, particularly, working
nights, a little two-year old boy had died and the parents came
in after I'd already done after-death care and the mother wanted
to see him. I could just hardly stand it. I just didn't know
what to do, and I was really beside myself. So I think the grief
part of it is something that it would have been nice to have some
support through that.
How was that handled, that aspect of your work?
From my standpoint, the best way you could get through it,
and then I told other students about it and they'd commiserate,
and that would make it OK.
But there weren't courses or seminars in dealing with the
emotional trauma of death.
No, there really weren't. That whole kind of thing that's
so common now, the first time I ever even heard about that was
when I went back to work in the mid-sixties. There was a
hematologist at Children's Hospital where I was working who had
some parent support groups for the children that were sick and
had died, and he would continue to see them after that. I

23

thought, if we'd only had that before. Because I found that
very, very difficult to deal with.
Crowell:

My really first awful traumatic thing was Good Friday of my
first year, so I'd been almost a whole year in training. I was
on the medical floor, down in the basement, men's medical, a very
unattractive ward. It had about twenty beds in it, and one of
the men sat up in bed and vomited blood and died. I was working
the split shift, and one of my classmates was working the evening
shift. She was in charge, she'd just gone off for supper, I was
alone on the floor. He just vomited a gush of blood and fell
back on his pillow. I was paralyzed for a moment. A young
medical student was there and he rushed over and pulled the
curtains, and then one of the interns came running in, I don't
know where he came from, and called for the emergency tray. I
went in to fix it, but we had to boil the water. First you
sucked up water into a tablespoon, and put it on the bunsen
burner and boiled it. Then you threw that water out, because
that sterilized the needle. This is an emergency, mind you. My
hands were shaking so hard I could hardly do it. Then I dropped
a little tablet into the sterile spoon, and you suck up more
distilled sterile water and shoot it down on this tablet, and
hold it over the flame so it'll dissolve. Then you suck it up
into the syringe, put a needle on it, rush out, and hand it to
the doctor. And the doctor looks up at me and says, "He's dead.
You're too late." And I thought, "I killed him, I killed him."
I thought, "I'm going to quit nursing. This isn't meant for

24

me." I cried. I didn't cry there, of course, but when my
classmate came back from supper, you know, all hell had broken
loose. "What happened? What happened?" And there was another
patient dying in a cubicle.
Adams:

These were all in open wards, with just curtains between?

Crowell:

Yes, I mean, we had pulled the curtains around, but
everybody knew he had died. He was a private patient who had
been brought down to the medical, clinic side, because we were
using penicillin. Penicillin was brand new, and he had sub-acute
bacterial endocarditis.

Adams:

Which means the lining of the heart was . . .

Crowell:

Some inflammation, some bacterial infection. They were
using penicillin on him on an experimental basis.

Adams:

Was it penicillin that you were administering?

Crowell:

No, that thing was a cardiac stimulator. If it had been in
the daytime, I would have gone into the nursing office and
resigned when I got off duty. But it was seven o'clock at night,
there was nobody around to resign to. I wept when I got back to
my room. My classmate and I stood behind a big pillar in that
ward, behind the head nurse's desk, and held hands and cried for
a few minutes, and then I said, "OK, it's all yours, kid." I
left, and then the other man died within an hour after I went off
duty. She had him to take care of. The family of the one who
died suddenly came back, and I heard the wife's screams. Oh,
golly, it was awful. Then she came to me, with the intern, and
said, "I've got tickets to the Voice of the Turtle for tomorrow

25

night, four tickets that I won't be using, and I want you girls
who took care of him so well to have the tickets." And the
intern was standing behind her, nodding his head, saying, "Take
them." So, I took them, and I went to the show with three other
classmates, and laughed, because it was a comedy, although I
thought I'd never laugh again. But I did. I didn't resign.
Adams:

What about the more positive experiences that made you say,
"Ah. This is why I've gone through it." During your training?

Crowell:

Well, during training, I really did like nursing. I never
really had problems, except in these awful times. I never felt
like I saved anyone. But there were times when I felt I did a
good job on whatever it happened to be. There are very few
times, really, did you really feel, "I've done something that
somebody else hasn't been able to do." Very few.

Adams:

Hew about positive experiences for you, during that three
years.

Harder:

I think there are a couple of times that I remember getting
corrplimented as a group for the kind of care that had been
given. I remember a little boy we had on pediatrics that had
very severe burn scars on his hip. Gasoline or something had
exploded and burned him and they were preparing this area for
surgery. His hands were burned also, and we had to put sterile
saline dressings on these areas every two hours. I mean, it was
a tremendous lot of nursing care, but I remember one of the
surgical residents saying, in front of everybody, what a good job
the nurses did, in keeping it clean. "They've really done a good

26

job." I was part of the team that had been doing all the care.
Mams:

Did you often get that public acknowledgment, or was that
unusual?

Harder:

Well, I think the patients were generally very nice to us.
In fact, I enjoyed working on the wards, when everybody was out
there where I could see them all and knew what they were up to.
It kind of got to be like one big family, if you were on a ward
for a certain amount of time, it was just really neat. It made
me nervous to work on the private side, with everybody behind
those doors. I didn't know what was going on.

Adams:

Were there pranks or jokes played on you as student nurses
by the med students or the doctors. Any of that sort of
roughhousing?

Harder:

We heard about some of the things, particularly in the
operating room, when they'd send the new nurse out to get the
wheel from the miscarriage or something like that, or some
Fallopian tubes, you know, that kind of thing.

Crowell:

Yes. I heard about those, but it never happened to me.

Harder:

I enjoyed the operating room a lot. In fact, that's where I
took my elective and then I worked in an operating room for about
four years after I graduated. I'd gotten tired of the bedpan
kind of care, and so I was content to have the patient
unconscious, doing the mechanical kinds of things, for a while.
Generally speaking. Sometimes the operating room could be pretty
intense and some of the surgeons could be pretty nasty, but
generally it was kind of a lighthearted, funny place to work,

27

particularly with the house staff.
Crowell:

No, I didn't like surgery at all. I was terrified from Day
One to day whatever. I told the head nurse at the end that I had
been. She said, "You didn't shew it."

Adams:

Well, that's to your credit.

Crowell:

I guess so.

Harder:

No, there's something about learning the task, mastering the
tasks. It was understanding what was going on . . .

Crowell:

Finite control, yes.

Harder:

. . .at the end of this operation, I could look back and
say, you know, "I didn't make a mistake. I knew what they
needed." And I enjoyed that. That gave me a lot of
self-confidence.

Adams:

Where did you learn values in nursing, ethics in nursing?
Were there courses that covered those kinds of situations, or was
that more experiential?

Harder:

That was mentioned pretty much through all the classes.
There were things you didn't do, and when you were capped, you
took the oath, which said, "I will never take nor knowingly give
any harmful drugs." That's the line that sticks in my mind. And
I never did. I never was tempted to. We used to have the
narcotics under lock and key. We wore the key on our sleeves, so
that if anybody else needed it, they just came in and took it off
your sleeve.

Crowell:

That1s changed.

Harder:

We counted all the narcotics at the end of each shift,

28

whoever was in charge, and signed the book, and you were very
careful, if you dropped one of these precious little pellets, and
two fell into the boiling water instead of just one. That's how
we mixed our morphine, too. We would get someone to witness the
fact that you were throwing it away, and sign for it. But
nebutol and secanol was on the open shelf.
Crowell:

I can't remember, while I was at Stanford, there ever being
any problem with that, or any indication that anybody, anywhere
was into drugs.

Adams:

Were any of your classmates dismissed from school?

Harder:

No.

Crowell:

Three of the girls who started withm& didn't finish. One
got married, one was never capped, and I understand it was
because she just wasn't cut out for it; you know, it wasn't
talked about, she just disappeared. We never saw her again. But
I think I vaguely remember that she just wasn't strong enough.
And then the second girl left for medical reasons, physical
reasons. She just couldn't do the hard work. But nobody was
ever expelled while I was there.

Harder:

No, not for cause. There were two girls that went in with
me that were not capped. One, I think, left fairly soon. I
think within three or four months, and apparently academically,
she just wasn't cutting it. I never had any clear idea of what
had gone on. The other girl, I don't know whether she had some
physical problem or not, but I do remember feeling very sorry for
her. She had a terrible time staying awake in class. I mean,

29

she was just sleeping all the time, and so I wasn't really
surprised when I found out that she was gone.
Mams:

Was there any sort of drug, substance abuse at that time?

Harder:

No, that's what I mean when I say I was never aware of any
problem. There was never, at least that I was aware of, anything
missing.

Crowell:

There were no guards around.

Harder:

No, nothing.

Crowell:

And the medical ward that I speak of, the women's ward was
down in the basement, too, and it was connected to the clinic by
a walkway, an open walkway, and anybody could have come in off
the street, through the clinic building, into the ward. At
night, if they jimmied the doors of the clinic building open and
had come over to us, we were alone on those wards. There would
be, on the night shift, one nurse for both wards?

Harder:

Yes.

Crowell:

And on the evening shift, there was a nurse for each ward.
But no guards, I never heard of anybody having any trouble.

Harder:

We were two blocks from the Fillmore District.

Crowell:

Yes, two blocks.

Harder:

It was a different time.

Crowell:

Yes, it's a different world.

Mams:

What about the relationship of nurses, as student nurses and
then later when you graduated, with the medical staff, with the
medical team? Now I'm moving into changes that you've observed
from when you were a student and when you went into practice.

30

What was that relationship like?
Harder:

I can't remember much contact with the private doctors that
taught the nursing school; generally our main contact was seeing
them in class. Some of them did, there was one pediatrician, the
one who gave us our communicable disease lectures.

Adams:

Do you remember his name?

Harder:

Yes. Dr. Martin Gershman. He's still practicing in San
Francisco. He was the only one who apparently took the time to
learn our names. And I remember how surprised we were when he
would call on us by name and look right at us in class. He had a
chart. But he was the only one who ever did that. He had a
chart with our names on it, and took the trouble to learn our
names.

Crowell:

And called you Miss, though.

Harder:

And called us Miss So-and-so. He would call us by name when
he saw us. Of course, we had our name on our bib, but he would
call us by name and, lo, many years later when I met him in the
Children's Hospital, he still remembered me and remembered what
my maiden name was and all about me. I thought that was
marvelous. But most of the contact was just . . .

Crowell:

Very formal.

Harder:

Very formal. Some of them were very nice, I mean, friendly,
and some were not. As far as the house staff, that too varied.
It was mostly formal. No first name calling. In fact, you
didn't call each other by first names on the floors.

Crowell:

That's right. You weren't supposed to let the patients know

31

what your first name was. Therefore you addressed each other by
your title.
Adams:

Probationer?

Harder:

You'd say Miss So-and-so, whatever it was.

Crowell:

Yes. Always. The aides we did call by their first names.
I came back as a graduate, as the head nurse of first the newborn
nursery and then the floor, and I had a lot of nurses' aides by
then. And we called them by their first names, I think, until a
directive came around that everyone was to be addressed by their
surnames, even the cleaning woman in the nursery (there was a
servant, a maid). All she did was clean, boil this and clean
that. She didn't handle the sterile stuff, she just mopped the
floors constantly and kept the place clean. She was to be
addressed as Mrs. Harris. It took us two weeks to get onto the
routine, and then all of a sudden, everybody's calling everybody
else by the first name. I don't know when that happened.

Adams:

Looking back on your education, what were the strengths or
weaknesses of the curriculum or the training? When you went out
on your first job, and I need to ask you what your first job was
after school, did you feel prepared, or unprepared in some areas?

Harder:

To be very honest with you, I felt that I could have gone to
any hospital, anywhere that I was aware of, certainly anyplace in
California, and gone onto any service: med, surg, pediatrics, you
name it—with the possible exception of the delivery room (I
hadn't had that much experience there) and done a credible job.
And I guess one of the things that surprised me, when I went back

32

to work in the mid-sixties at Children's Hospital, was realizing
that a nurse who was coming right out of nursing school (and this
particular one had been through a masters program, gone through
the baccalaureate program, through the masters program) was given
essentially three months probationary period, just to teach her
all the things that we learned our first year in training.
Crowell:

Oh, really!

Harder:

Didn't you feel the same way when you got out of school,
that you could have gone virtually anywhere and turned in a
credible performance?

Crowell:

Although I was told, while we were in training, that it
would be six months on the job before you were really earning
your salary, on any new job. I remember Miss Heitman telling us
that.
I went to work in the maternity ward, in the newborn nursery
of the small private hospital run by sisters of charity in San
Jose. They didn't have to show me how to do anything. But I
remember we used to gavage the babies, the little tiny preemies.

Adams:

Gavage?

Crowell:

We stick a tube down the throat, down into their stomachs,
and then . . .

Harder:

Put the formula down.

Crowell:

. . . put the formula down, because they were too weak to
drink or suck. And you could kill a baby doing that, of course,
if you put it in the lung. But, there's a very simple test to be
sure you're not in the lung. I remember that I was supposed to

33

replace a girl who had to take time off to have a broken shoulder
fixed or something. They kept her on for a few weeks after I was
hired until they felt that I now could replace her. Pretty soon
I was doing exactly what all the other graduates were doing.
Adams:

When you took you state boards, at what stage was that? Was
that right after graduation?

Crowell:

Yes.

Harder:

In our case, it was.

Crowell:

About six weeks.

Harder:

Yes. Something like that. We graduated about the middle of
September, and boards were in October.

Crowell:

We were allowed two weeks sick leave per year, so that if
you had any really serious illness including an appendectomy,
you'd use up more than two weeks in any one year. You couldn't
accumulate it. So very few of the class actually graduated the
day they should have.

Adams:

Because they really kept an accounting of your days.

Crowell:

Yes. Very strict. In my class of thirty-four, there were
about seven of us who finished on time, and then, over the next
few weeks, others graduated by driblets. One classmate had to
have an appendectomy. She had two weeks to make up. Then the
boards were in October or November.

Harder:

Somewhere around in there.

Crowell:

Because then we came back to Stanford.

Adams:

Were the state boards given just once in the year?

Crowell:

I'm not sure if they were given once or twice a year. And

34

the rumor was, no Stanford grad had ever failed. So the pressure
was on us.
Adams:

Did you feel as prepared for the boards as you did for your
first work?

Crowell:

Oh, yes. There was no problem passing the boards. It was
an all day exam, wasn't it?

Harder:

Wasn't it two days?

Crowell:

TWo days, yes.

Harder:

TWo days we spent in the nurses room. I remember six months
before we graduated, some of my classmates were studying for
state boards, and I couldn't believe it. I said, "What are you
studying?"

Adams:

Did it panic you a little bit?

Harder:

No, because I couldn't figure out what they were studying,
unless they were reviewing every single note they'd ever taken
and rereading all the textbooks. What in the world would you
study?

Adams:

Did you have access to old exams?

Crowell:

Well, there was a book.

Harder:

Was there a book?

Crcwell:

I can remember being tutored by my big sister. She was
asking me questions and she called it "bitchchloride of
mercury". I said, "It's bichloride." [Laughter]

Harder:

I just felt that if I couldn't pass the state board six
weeks after I graduated, I didn't deserve to pass it, and I
didn't need to study for it.

35

Adams:

I would have been one of those in there studying.

Harder:

Well, I think today it's a totally different situation.

Adams:

What was your first job in nursing?

Harder:

Well, as soon as I graduated, I had applied to, I wanted to
stay at Stanford. I had a social life going on here. I wanted
to work in the operating room, but there were no openings then,
so they offered me the night nurse job on men's and women's
medical. When my classmates found out that I was going to be the
night nurse on that, boy, did they hoot. Because that was
considered a lower level assignment. I worked there for two
months, and then the operating room.

Adams:

And your first nursing?

Crowell:

It was in a newborn nursery in a private hospital. The
difference was that there were no staff doctors. There was a
nursing school but there were no interns or residents. So that
when there was a "bad baby" expected in the delivery room, the
nursery nurse was called for, and we caught the babies, and we
resuscitated them. That was very nerve-wracking. I was told,
"Take a lot of gum and chew gum while you're working." You can
work off a lot of tension by chewing gum.

Adams:

Do you still chew gum when you're tense?

Crowell:

Well, I haven't had to resuscitate a baby for a long time.

Adams:

Anything that I haven't asked you that you've thought of
that you wanted to say, with respect to your education, or the
future of nursing?

Harder:

You know, I didn't go through nursing with the idea that I

36

was going to make it my life's work. I wanted to get married and
have children. And so I got married and I had children. I
stayed home for twelve years doing that. Then my husband got
sick and I had to go back to work, and that was an interesting
thing, because after twelve years, I knew I didn't want to go
back to the operating room. No way. Things had changed too
much. So I stopped by Children's Hospital and said, what did
they have, and they said, "Well, we really need nurses. What do
you think you could do after all this time?" And I said, "Well,
I could diaper a baby. I'm sure that I could do well in the
newborn nursery, I've been doing that for a long time new." Oh,
the supervisor wouldn't let me out of the office. She dragged me
over to meet the chief nurse because they were going through a
humongous nursing shortage in the newborn nursery. I wasn't
going to get out there without signing the papers, and whatever,
so I had the job. I found that a little dull. The whole idea of
neo-natal intensive care was just beginning to get started. I
mean, they were just starting to do all the really great invasive
procedures on the preemies. So I got in on the beginning of
that, as far as learning all that kind of thing.
Adams:

Are you still nursing?

Harder:

Yes, but I'm in public health.

Crowell:

I came back to Stanford as head nurse of the

[END OF TAPE ONE]

37

[BEGINNING OF TAPE TWO]

Crowell:

I worked with the Sisters of Charity, with the big coif.

Adams:

What advances in your area of nursing do you consider to be
revolutionary?

Crowell:

What they do with babies ncwi I don't think we saved very
many under three pounds, because once we started to feed them,
they'd die. You couldn't keep them alive without feeding them,
and as soon as you fed them, they died. Very few under three
pounds survived, in my experience. And now, some quintuplets
were born the other day and they weighed less than a pound
apiece. To me, that's an incredible advance. I don't know
whether that's so good.

Harder:

Sometimes it's a mixed blessing.

Crcwell:

To survive.

Adams:

Because the other kind of damage that happens?

Crowell:

Yes. I don't suppose there are enough statistics, but how
many survive to a healthy adulthood?

Harder:

Well, there are enough successes, even with some of the
really small, sick ones, that seem to make it worthwhile for
people to pursue it, to try it for all of them. But, yes, some
of the children with the very immature lungs that they save now,
they have this chronic lung condition. They're home with all
this equipment, with the oxygen.

Crowell:

For the rest of their lives.

Harder:

Well, usually by the time they're about eight years old

38

their lungs mature to the point where they don't need that. But,
I mean, there may be other things. Brain damage or whatever.
What the parents have to go through! In public health, we see a
lot of this. There are so few intact families after a period of
time with this, because it just tears things apart; they have to
have a real strong marriage and strong support system to
withstand it.
Adams:

Do you have time to talk a little bit about public health
nursing?

Crowell:

I've had a very interesting life, but it hasn't been much to
do with nursing [Laughter].

Adams:

I don't want to keep you too much longer, but I did want to
get into the public health nursing a little bit. When did you
first make the change?

Harder:

The transition? Well, to be honest with you, when I was in
nursing school, I was not terribly interested in public health,
even Visiting Nurses Association, which a lot of the girls
liked. I had no interest in at all. I always felt uncomfortable
when I was away from the protective arms of the hospital and all
that support system. I really didn't have that much confidence
then. But after having children and getting a little more life
experience and this kind of thing. When my husband died, and I
had these four kids that I wanted to raise, I couldn't be working
P.M.s and nights. One of my classmates, who was a school nurse,
strongly urged me to go back to school and get my public health
credential and school nursing, to entertain that idea. Under her

prodding and my parents supporting that decision, I did it. At
that time, HEW in Washington was very generous with grants to get
people into public health. So, under a grant, and with what I
was getting from Social Security, from my husband's estate, went
back to UC San Francisco for three quarters.
Did Stanford not have a public health program?
No, they didn't have any program of that type. This was
just for people who already had a baccalaureate but just needed
the public health add-on or school nurse experience. That had
one major benefit for me. Because of what had been happening in
my private life, it was just marvelous for me to have to get out
of the hospital and get away from the kids and go back to school
again, even though that was kind of traumatic. I was mature
enough to really understand what I was being taught, instead of
just being this empty vessel that I feel that I was before. I
could make a better informed decision about jobs. What I had
decided was, that I did not want to be a school nurse. If I was
going to work in anything, it would be public health, because I
felt that I could make some use of, particularly my maternal,
child health experience in that. Generally that's the field that
I've been interested in. So I moved back to Sacramento, which
was my home, where my kids were then
How old were your children at that time?
My oldest daughter was thirteen and the youngest one was
four when her father died, and then it was another two years
before we moved back to Sacramento.

40

Adams:

What does a public health nurse do?

Harder:

In broad terms, she tries to improve health behaviors of
individuals.

Adams:

Are you sent out by a county agency?

Harder:

Yes. I worked for the county health department in
Sacramento for about fourteen and a half years, two and a half
years as a field nurse. I had an assigned geographic area, and
whatever referrals came in for that area were mine. The only
referrals I did not get directly were new TB cases, because there
was a particular unit that did all the TB.

Adams:

So you had quite a range of cases.

Harder:

Yes. But they mostly fell into childhood. You know, we'd
get prenatals who needed some teaching, and postpartums and that
kind of thing. We had a little bit of communicable disease kind
of things to do. Are you familiar with the CCS program, the
California Childrens' Service? Used to be called Crippled
Childrens' Service. It's sort of a health insurance program for
certain medically eligible conditions, for people who don't have
other resources. We did all the initial paperwork on these
families and did kind of a general family assessment to see if
there might be some other health needs, of course, reviewing
immunization levels, and promoting positive health practices.

Adams:

Sounds exciting, in terms of the variety and responsibility.

Harder:

This was in '69, when I first started out. Most of the
families or individuals who I came in contact with were not
hard-core dysfunctional people. They just needed a little help.

41

It was not all that intense. We had baby clinic assignments,
too. After two and a half years or so, I had an opportunity to
move into a different department, I got promoted to the next
higher level, and work in special community programs. That was a
terrific shot in the arm for me, as far as building my
self-confidence. I could get out and work with other
health-oriented community agencies. I did that for two or three
years. Then I was offered the job as supervisor of the
Chest

, which was the TB control unit, which was something

that I'd never been terribly interested in. Once I got into it,
I found it was really kind of nice, because it was very cut and
dry. You know, you did this and this and this and gave the
medications, and whatever. Being a supervisor was a lot like
being a mother in many ways. I did not have the title of
assistant nursing director but I acted as an assistant nursing
director for about two years, helping the nursing director in
that capacity. I did the budgets and a lot of other stuff. Then
I was forced, not through my choice but because of changes in the
budgeting process and kind of pulling back in some positions, to
take a job as supervisor of a group of nurses and a couple of
health centers in the northern part of Sacramento County, a job
which I knew how to do but it wasn't particularly challenging to
me. When a like position came up in Yolo County, right next
door, I took that even though it was a cut in pay, because I
thought, I've got six more years to work, I can't just sit here,
because I'll just vegetate. So I'm working in a smaller county,

where I have really a lot more responsibility and a lot more
variety to do, even in the day of shrinking dollars, and Yolo
County is a very poor county. It's been very rewarding.
Adams:

What do you see as the most important public health concern?

Harder:

I think there are two major ones. AIDS, of course, that
whole thing is going to be with us for a while. There is an
intensity of working with families. The families that we get
involved with new are nothing like the ones that I was involved
with twenty years ago.

Adams:

There's no extended family?

Harder:

There's no extended family, there's the teen parents,
there's the drug problems, there's dysfunctional activity that's
just unbelievable. And all these little children, caught up in
all of that, you know. Sometimes you want to . . .

Adams:

They become the victims of it.

Harder:

Yes. They are victims. And all you can see, you know, is
they're not amenable to change, and most of them aren't. It's
just the same thing, perpetuating itself, generation after
generation.

Adams:

Any of your children going into medicine or nursing.

Harder:

[Laughter] I have four daughters, and none of them are
remotely interested in nursing or medicine or anything like it.
But they're all very good and happy at doing what they're doing.

Adams:

Anything I should have asked, or any loose ends?

Harder:

No. I can't think of anything. As I said at the beginning,
I can't think of any field that I'd rather have been in. I can't

say that I'm sorry that none of my daughters have gone into
nursing. I think maybe from a standpoint of my interaction with
them, it's just as well that they aren't. I think I would have
been tempted to put my oar in the water.
One last question which could be off the record, if you
wish, but at the luncheon, the speaker mentioned an obvious
interest in beginning the nursing school, start it again. Do you
have feelings in that area, as an alum?
I don't think it's a practical idea right now. I think
there's an awful lot of work yet to be done. There are a lot of
good nursing programs suffering for lack of applicants, and I
think we've got to start promoting, recruiting, or getting the
idea planted in people's heads—men's and women's—at an early
age, about nursing as a career. My boss, at work, attended a
meeting recently where they talked about recruiting. They're not
talking about recruiting somebody out of college. They're
talking about going into junior highs and planting the seeds at
Career Days in high schools, that kind of things, and getting it
early. Because apparently, the schools that have that kind of
activity base their requests for information on what the students
say they want. They want information about computer work, they
want information about blah-blah-blah. That's what they get.
Nursing has not been mentioned on those lists for years.
So you really have to be assertive in getting information
out.
Yes. So it's an idea of going to the schools and saying,

"Hey, here's a field that's wide open." I think that, number
one, the cost of education at Stanford would be just prohibitive,
unless there was some funding, like the cadet nurse corps. And
in fact, I don't knew whether you're aware of it, but that's been
talked about, reviving that concept again in an effort to get,
perhaps, lower-income kids into nursing schools.
Well, it could be with the Packard family trust being set up
at the Children's Hospital, there might be some funding from
private donors to encourage people.
Interestingly enough, both in Sacramento County and in Yolo
County, we have nursing students from Sacramento State in their
senior year, who come to us for a semester for their community
health experience. That nursing school still has a waiting list
of applicants waiting to get in. They are, as far as I know, the
only state university baccalaureate nursing program in the state
that has that kind of drawing power. Chico State didn't even have
a nursing class this past year.
Now what draws students there?
Well, I think it's the metropolitan area. Sacramento may be
looked on by some as being a cow town, but actually the county is
getting upwards to a million population, now. There are several
hospitals and other opportunities. It's halfway the mountains,
to ski, and near the ocean. There are a lot of other work
opportunities. Most of the students that come to us for this
semester are working at other jobs, some of them working in the
hospital, as aides or whatever. And some of them working at jobs

outside of nursing to get themselves through school. A lot of
them are married, with children.
Adams:

That's different from what you described in your experience.

Haider:

I can't conceive of anything like that then. But the
opportunities to do that are obviously present in an area that
had a lot of job opportunities. If you go to Chico, even though
that's a college town, there isn't really much up there
otherwise. So, yes, I can see why that might be true.
