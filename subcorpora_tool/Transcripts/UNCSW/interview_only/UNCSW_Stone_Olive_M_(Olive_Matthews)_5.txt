Sherna Gluck: The name Polly we never clarified. It seems to have been  used by many of the people with whom you were involved in the more liberal  and progressive circles, and I wonder where that came from . That Gelders  letter to you in 1938, for instance, was addressed "Dear Polly. "  Olive Stone: Yes. It was originated by children who couldn't say  Olive very well, but they happened to be the children of sort of radical  friends--that is, leftward-leaning liberals. You remember that Howard Kester  and his group spoke of radical Christians; well Lfaughte!7, I didn't like to  use the word radical because that sounds too socialistic or communistic, but  it doesn't have to. Nieble and all those great teachers in the theological  schools spoke of radical things. It was used by those people first, and a  lot of others who came in began calling me Polly- -though a number of them  who've worked 'ith me, such as former students, still say Olive because  that's what everybody else &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; I mean, what they did as students. So to  change to Polly didn' t seem natural . But it was not necessarily a code name.  SG : o, I didn1 t think that. But it seemed to be something that people  in those circles used, whereas professionally the letters that were to you  as a professional social worker were 11 0live. "  Stone : Yes, yes , they were.  SG : I was just wondering.  Stone : lell, the Smith College professors call me Polly still.  SG: Then the issue came up of possibly your association to Highlander  actually dated back to 1 32.  Stone: Yes , we found that it did.  SG: Do you recall what that was then?  I'  II  I  11  11  1i  2  Stone: Yes . ay I get the letter? That's the letter from the governor1  s executive assistant, appointing me to the other thing. This is the  letter (and I've made copies of it. ) He says that he met me in Chattanooga  two years before, which would have been 1 32. And in their history book  that's t e year they started. But I didn't go to Highlander . He thought  when I wrote him a letter saying that &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226; (I had this letter; he didn't  have a copy of this or remember it. You see, they had no letter-head either;  we didn't have any then Lfaughte!J until later. They got their letterhead  and they got a little publication, which he sent me in this, I believe. )  And so he sa s, 11 I 1m planning to spend the last week of August &#8226; &#8226; II &#8226; &#8226; I had  left by this time; he sent it to 1 ontgomery, so we had apparently been in  touch from the time. &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; But what we decided is, this must have been a  sociological meeting at Chattanooga, because the meeting that had the chase-you  really must read it; it' s perfectly delightful what happened to this  group in Chattanooga that was going to have an interracial meeting. (But it  turned out to be 1935, and this was 1932 that we met in Chattanooga. ) Xnd  the meeting in Chattanooga that Highlander was to have and that Kester and  others (Jim mbrowsky, Don lest probably; he gives the names of the ones  who called it--nine people) . &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; And they got a large group. T&#183;hey were  given a .asonic Hall1 and when it was learned that it was to be biracial they  told them they had to get out, so they went to another hall. And when they  found it as biracial they said they had to get out. So they said in a  rather loud voice as they were leaving that they would meet at a certain  place; and then the 10rd was quietly passed along that they would not be  going there. They were going to send the police on a chase, because the  police had been coming in and getting all excited and alarmed, and gathering  there to "run the Reds out of town. 11 So they learned from Nieble, who was  a reporter from the Chattanooga News (he still writes, you know&#183;-I'll get  his full name there); he followed the police and found out that this is what  happened. At this place they looked around and couldn1 t find anybody (that  is, a gathering ), so they asked a couple that came along quite innocently  if they'd seen anybody meeting. And they said well, they saw a crowd at  such-and-such a place that looked sort of suspicious. They went galloping  up there and surrounded this group; it turned out to be Jones Reactionary  Religious College Lfaughtey, which later moved. They were sitting out on  the lawn having a commencement exercise Lfaughte!]. I think they went several  places before Lfaughte.!:7 they gave up and went home. And the . es group  went to Highland, the house that a lady had given them and that they occupied  with very little in the way of resources. He had Don \est, who was also a  theological student, as he had been, and John Thompson, whom I met out here  He died only recently. He was a theological student; he went on into the  ministry. He and his sister came there and helped for a while, and Dorothy  his sister stayed on. But they lived under meager circumsta.nces--never did  receive any salary. But you know what they were up against ~  SG: 01 I wanted to clarify on Lucy Randolph ason. Your contact with  her was just that one&#183; time in 1937 or so, when she. . . .  Stone: Spoke to my class. And the letter that you read, I think, f'rom  I  her saying she had never done anything that had been so satisf'ying to her;  and she' s quoting, then, Tyndall and other books Her papers are at Duke  University. ow I would l ove to know whether she' s 'still living and where  she lives. Do you know anything about it?  SG: o. Jacqueline probably would know.  Stone: Aha . I asked Jacqueline to try to find out about if ~innie  bernatby &#183;ro.s anywhere around. I think I told you that ate '/ay didn1 t  know anything that's going on; she used to be treasurer of this group. But  it may be that gal who has written about southern women, you know, would  knol at Duke. And I imagine she' s the one that got Lucy Randolph ason1 s  things.  SG: T iat1 s right.  Stone: She's written two books .  SG : Scott.  Stone: Scott; she' s at Duke, yes. And I understand that this man 1ho  \rote the poetry about the sharecroppers is at Duke.  4  SG: 0 &#8226; &#183;&#183;ou the other note I have down was to discuss this cooperative  thing that Sam Franklin had set up. That and this 1935 conference at Howard  were the fa o other little things I had written down still  Stone: ell I have straightened out the Franklin thing--maybe it' s right  here--because I didn' t visit until &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226; Lfnterruptio~  I believe it 'las because I continued to have an interest in the farmers . You  kno , the reason I didn' t follow Lucy Randolph ason: I never have taken an  interest in the manufacturing. I just somehow haven' t been able to . I was  born in a SI!lall tom; my father had a farm; I tried to collect money 01ed to  him at his death in 1926, and I saw the condition of the tenants and the  sharecroppers and the owner s. The owners we e in sad condition too; the  Depression started fo them long ago . t any rate, I liked Lucy Randolph  :a son. d the thin &#183;re could do , you see, is: nybody, with h r forebearer s,  /.f.a ht er would elcome her in any institution, any place. ow 1ould you  turn do m a l&#183;:ason, you know, Lfaughte;:,7 in Virginia7 But I don 1 t think she  rode on that; she just loved her work. I didn't keep up uith her, but I  did keep up ' it farl!ling groups and with the peace groups (which I loved  very much), the Fellowship of Reconciliation. And Sam Franklin had been  one of the ones in Japan; and I think I told you he studied. And Sherwin  Eddy started these cooperative farms in ississippi, and Sam and his wife  and some other--I remember a uaker couple. He was a physician, and his  wife assisted. He came and donated his services to give examinations of  these people. d when I visited them in ississippi (probably during  5  that sabbatical leave from 'lilliam and ary--and I didn1 t return; you know  I took the Georgia job) I found Jews Bend, and I started my research there.  SG : Oh, so it was on that trip then.  Stone: It was on that trip that I went to the delta, and I went all  over the South again. I made several trips over the South. Tne first trip  was in the summer of 1936 for my Alabama dissertation; and I did my research  just in the state, visiting all sixty-seven counties and learning all about  them there. I visited the officials of the county, and especially the  farm people. But I got over to Franklin somewhere in the forties--it must  have been 1 41 that I ,.,as there.  SG : So when did Franklin start that farm?  Stone: Oh, it started in the thirties. And he a ctually came to 1illiam  and ~:ary before that; and let. me &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; if you1 11 shut it off, ! 1 11 go get  that. Lfnterruptio.!!7  SG : . here did the land come :rrom? &#183;/as the land donated to them for  the farm?  Stone : I 'm not sure about this . You know there are a lot of foreclosures,  and ~arms could be bought easily from the mor tga e-holders. Of  6  course, the banks and other people came to own farms during the Depression.  SG : &#183;. ell how many families lived on this farm, then?  Stone: &#183; te a fer.&#183;1. They were called the Del ta Cooperative Farm, and  there were tlo places : the Hill House, &#183;ississippi and Rochdale. Reinhold  &#183;-eible \as t_e president, Sherwin Eddy the secretary-treasurer; 1 illiam  Amberson, John Rusk and Sam Franklin, Jr. were among the trustees. And the  telephone was given as Delta Farms; and the eastern office as on adison  Avenue in -el Yor1  &#8226; And they raised money to help support it. But I kno 1  that Sam anklin told me when they were harvestin0 their first cooperative  crop there ras great uneasiness on the part of the people as to whether they  could trust the cooperative any more than they could trust the former landlord  who _ept the boo s and ever ything. And Sam tried to make it so open  that the could see the books all the ti e ; they could always ask questions ;  that they 1ere voters and so on. But this long, lon~ history &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; stood out.  SG : m&#183;1 Tas it interracial?  Stone: 0 yes . I 'm not sure ; I think it was just blac &#8226; And the whites  we e running it, you see ; so I think it must have been a racial &#8226;&#8226; &#8226; &#8226; But  he rr te ne (this is uher e it started) February 9. ( ow I don&#8226; t know why I  don1 t have an earlier thing, what I wrote him. ) It says, 11 ! was delighted  to have 1ord of you again after so many year s have elapsed. rs . Franklin  and I loo"' bac: to your visit in Japan as one of my truly stir ring and cr eative  contacts . I have thought of you many times since and ished I could get in  Y\B.r eza Ta  touch ;litn ou I still r ecall very vividly our di scussion in Caveazala with  you, and if ou remember it you will understand that in many ways my present  wor is a release from artificial handicaps agai nst which I rebelled in Japan.  Ifie had to be car eful as a missionary not to fight the Japanese government too  much. I feel we are on the track of something big, which we may achieve  if we remain objective and realistic. I shall await the publication of  your doctoral dissertation with the greatest of interest. 1 have already  found Dr. Arthur Rayper1 s Preface to Peasantry very helpful. /jiell, he must  have heard from meJ I should be glad to discuss our farm with you, and  so on. I am enclosing a little pamphlet of my own hich will give you a  bird's-eye view of our organization. Dr. Eddy's article in the current  Christian Century will bring you up to date." I don't have it, but I can  lo k. This is in &#8226;;7.  SGs Well, I think the main thing is your impressions of the farm when  y u visited.  7  Stones They had a dairy, and they were supposed to have a variety &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  not staple crop alone.  SG: How large was &#183;it, do you recall?  Stone: No I don't.  SG1 How 'fJJB:!f3 families was it supposed to support?  Stone: I didn't have an opportunity, I 1m sorry to say, to meet ith  the gr up. I ish I bad, because I ould have loved to see them, hear them  talk and so on. But I should imagine about thirty or forty :families at the  most.  SG: Now they lived on the land.  Stones Lived on the land, yes. Lf.nterruptio"!iJ &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; receiv d an interesting  letter from a visiting -pr fessor at your institute--! told you about  Dr. Mondell, did I? All right. He was telling me about a cooperative farm  with young Jewish farmers near Burkville. "The gentleman who wrote us was  given my name by you. He taught sociology r social work at Riehm nd  8  Institute. His name was Bondi, but Sam c uldn1 t figure it out. Lfaughter  Tbat1&#183;s by' he wrote me. "Un~ rtunately I cann t quite decipher his signature.  I should appr ciate it if y u w uld enlighten me, for I am much  interested in what he tells m and uld like t write t him. Mrs. Franklin  and I regret that our paths and y urs have n t crossed since the eccasi n  f y ur visit t Japan years ag &#8226; W should certainly like t c pare n tes  with y u n all that has transpired since. Our pr jects have gr wn gradually  and have been attended by en ugh success t keep us very sensible f the  privilege of this w rk. Please dr p me a line at the typed address ab ve,  which is my own residence." And that's Route l, Providence C perative Farm,  Cruger, ississippi. And the ther address bad been Hill House, and it was  called Delta Farm; this is called Delta 0 perative Farms, but it has the  ther address. Then the next I knew I had a letter saying he was c 1ng to  Riehm nd; that was written in Oct ber ab ut Dr. B ndi. I replied t that; &#8226;t&#8226; d  said, Y b en planning f r s e time t inquire ho things are going. I am  glad, therefore, that Dr. Kurt Bondi, a visiting profess r this year, asked  me f r the names of projects of this kind in the United States. As he wr te  y u, he is spending part of his time w rldng f r the c perative farm f  y ung Je ish farmers near Burkville, and is deeply concerned ver helping  these young people make and adjustment t their new environment. Any practical  suggestions hich you can give him w 11 be gratef'ully received, I'm  sure. I hope very much t be able t visit y ur farm some day when I am in  the deep S uth.&#183; La.st summer, as I came fr m m:y sister' s farm in Texas fer  a brief stop with my br ther in Georgia, I hoped to stop off, but fund that  I did not have sufficient time. That was the summer-it said last surmn r,  1939--tbat I ent to Mexic &#8226; I spent several weeks in Mexico; it as during  9  the Oard nesse regime, when they had g ne tbr ugh a great many ref rms:  they abolished the monasteries and set up a workers' university. And I  attended the w rkers1 university (where they taught in English Lfaughte~-I  t k a c urse in Spanish, but didn't get very far) and visited a let f  their c perative farms. S I didn't &#183;have very much time t get back te  sch&#8226; 1-I s c ng back t Ricbmend. 1Don't yeu and s. Franklin ceme  Ea.et ecc sienall.y?

So that's where he's retired, and I wonder it  he has relatives there. I read in o~e of these books that Maryville is the  seat of the Ku Klux Klan and the most reactionary people. So I fir t wrote  him, and then I d cided to telegraph: Delighted to see you. Oan you speak  to interested group Tuesday evening? Answer collect by estern Union." I  love getting up meetings and letting people speak ~aughtei:J. I had a visitor  from Mexico come, an artist--one of those artists that after the 0 donesse  regime didn't ha e such easy sledding. It may have been the very on whos  mural was whitewashed over down here; sounds like that, but I can't think of  his name.  SG: Not the in Ne York? The one in Ne York?  Stone: No, the one down here in L.A. in the square where Los Angeles  began. You remember that one of the Mexican radical pa.inters painted, and  they whitewashed over it. Now they've been trying to restore it, but the  buildings are so close to it that it wouldn't be seen very well. At any  rate Franklin did come and talk, but I have no other records. I have 11  these Fellowship of Reconciliation things, but not that.
