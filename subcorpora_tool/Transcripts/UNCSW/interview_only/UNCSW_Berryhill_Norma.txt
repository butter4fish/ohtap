Mary Friday: Good morning, Mrs. Berryhill. Norma Berryhill: Good morning, Mary. M.F.: Awfully glad you can see me today. Berryhilli I'm delighted. M.F.: You are what we consider an old time Chapel Hill resident. Berryhill: Thank you. That's a compliment. M.F.: It's meant to be one. But before you came to Chapel Hill, where did you come from originally? Berryhill: I was born in Warren County and went to school there for the first four years. I went to school in a log cabin, believe it or not. And I never had a teacher for those four years who had more than finished the seventh grade herself. M.F.: What were the ages of these teachers? Berryhill: Oh, they must have been from twenty to thirty. And the school year lasted for three months. And all the children in the community went to this school from first grade through tenth or eleventh, or as far as they went. [interruption] M.F.i Why was the school year only three months? Were you a farming family? Berryhill: We were a farming family, but that had nothing to do with the school. The school year, even in Warrenton, the large town in the county, went just a few months, too, longer than that, to be sure. But four families in the community had to even subsidize that, and my father owned the log cabin where the school was housed. And there were only two families in the community who were willing to board the teachers, so the Williams family alternated with my family Berryhill 2 taking the teachers to board. M.F.:  That's interesting.    Your father was obviously very interested in education.    What was his profession? Berryhill: My father was a cotton farmer.    It was really a very large cotton plantation.    My mother was equally interested  and  less harrassed.    Mother was the moving spirit in pushing it. M.F.:  How did  she go about getting the school organized?    Do you remember any of that? Berryhill: Oh,  I don't remember any of this. M.F.:  What about brothers and  sisters?    Were you from a large family? Berryhill: I am from a very large family.    I'm one of ten children. One of the children died  in infancy,  but nine of us have lived  until just three years ago. M.F.: And  where were you placed  in that chronology? Berryhill: I was the third   child  and  the eldest daughter. M.F.: And  as the eldest daughter, did you feel you had a lot of pathways to forge? Berryhill:  I felt,  really,  very handicapped,  because I never played in snow until I left home because my older brothers made life so miserable for me snowballing that I had  to stay in the house during the snows.    And  as I told  them later in life,  I never tasted  fish until I left home.    Because we had  a lot of salt herring,  and  they have a lot of bonesyou wouldn't knowbut I sat between two younger brothers and  picked  out their bones,  and  by the time I got their fish Berryhill 3 ready to eat it was time to get up and  go to school. M.F.i  What about your duties as the oldest sister in a large household?    Did  you help your mother with work,  or what? Berryhill: I felt as if I had  brought up four young brothers. And when people ask me,  "Isn't is grand  to be of a large family?" I say,  "Sometimes it is,  and  sometimes it isn't."    But as we've grown older,  of course it has been.    We're a very closely knit family. M.F.j  Was there one particular brother and  sister you got along especially well with or felt had  a lot of influence on the way you thought? Berryhill:  I think I'd  put it the other way.    This younger brother of mine that I adored  until his death three years ago,  I felt that I was the one who had   the influence over him,  but I really adored  him, adored  them all.    And  to forgive them,  they tried  to make up to me for it,  I think,  because they all called  me "Miss Norma," and  the remaining ones still do. M.F.: What about the social life of a community like tte t for an adolescent girl,  or maybe even going back as a young woman? Berryhill: Our home burned  when I'd  finished  the fourth grade. And  since our home had  burned,  my family,  realizing the responsibility of educating a large family,        moved  to a farm two miles from Warrenton. And  Warrenton had much better schools.    The Graham High School was there, -rhich was a private high school,  and  the boys went there.    The Graham School was closed before I was ready for high school,  so I never went there.    But as high schools go,  in a rural county of that kind  in eastern North Carolina,  it was a fairly good  school. Berryhill 4 M.F.:  What about your high school education?    Where did  you go, and  what plans did  you make during high school? Berryhill:  I went to the high school in Warrenton. M.F.:  The public school. Berryhilli  The public school,  because the private one was closed by that time.    And   to be sure,  with my early educational background,   I could  scarcely read,  and  I can't spell until today.    But I've gotten along fairly well without being able to spell,  and  I certainly learned to read  and have had great joy in reading. M.F.:  What did  you think you would be doing for the majority of your life,  when you were in high school in Warrenton? Berryhill:  I always had  a leaning toward  social work of some order. M.F.:  Was it encouraged  by your family and  friends? Berryhill: Yes. M.F.: In what way? Berryhill:  They wanted  me to get further training.    I realized, and my family realized, and my teachers realized  that I wasn't ready to go to Women's College after leaving the high school in Warrenton.    So they looked  around  for meI wasn't really equipped  to look around  and find  out about thingsand Peace College in Raleigh was recommended very highly by people who had  been there and  people who knew about it. And  so after I had  graduated  from Warrenton High School,  I went to Peace College and  really spent three years there.    And  I consider the first year that I spent there really a year in high school.    And  when I graduated  from Peace College,  I went to Norlina to teach the sixth grade for a year.    Now I had had a very charming,  wonderful teacher of Berryhill 5 education at Peace College who taught that children should  be led  by a silken string,  but the sixth grade in Norlina wasn't the kind  that you could lead  the students with a silken string.    There were boys in my grade who were much taller than I and  one who was older than I.    I learned  pretty soon that they didn't know much about silken strings, and  it was miserable.    I counted  the hours until school was out the first week I was there. M.F.:  How old  were you at this time? Berryhill:  I was twenty at this time. M.F.:  How long did  you stay at that school before you went on? Berryhill:  I stayed  one year and   then came to summer school. M.F.:  The summer normal school,  or was it just summer school? Berryhill: It was regular summer school when Mr. N.W.  Walker was in charge of summer school.    And  took my first course in sociology under Dr. Odum.    And  I had  signed  up to go back to Norlina,  in desperation, but was at least getting some work behind me in the University,  hoping eventually to come here.    And  one day Dr. Odum called me into his private office and  asked me how I would  like to come to the University in the fall.    I told him I'd like to very much,  but I couldn't possibly because I still owed money to Peace College.    But he offered  me a scholarship, which I accepted very gratefully,  and finished  the summer school and  came back in the fall. M.F.:  What was your capacity in the fall?    Were you here as a graduate student? Berryhill: Oh,  no.    Peace College is only a two-year school.    I was Berryhill 6 a junior that fall and  lived  in the old  Archer House,  which was the only woman's dormitory, where for nearly twenty-eight girls,  I think, there were only two bathtubs.    And  the second year I was there,  it burned. M.F.:  So that would  have put it in 1920? Berryhill: I graduated  from Peace in '22,  taught at Norlina '22 and 23,  and  I came here the summer of  '23 and graduated  in the spring of 25 from the University. M.F.:  How did  you like the Archer House?    I've read   a number of materials on it,  and  it seems like it would have been quite an interesting place to live,  particularly in that time when people were getting so interested, in building a regular woman's dormitory,  which became Spencer. Berryhill:  Well,  I didn't know any better,  so I thought it was great,  great fun.    And. I was so glad  to be here.    My roommate and  I lived  in what had. been the servants'  quarter over the kitchen,  where there was no heat, only a little pot-bellied  stove.    And to show you what it was like,  in a very,  very cold  spell we had  no wood.    And  we had  to study that night,  and  the only place we could  study was our rooms.    So I told  my roommate to put on her warmest,  heaviest clothes and  to tie up her head, and   come with me.    Well,  she was a very gentle soul and did just this.    And  we went out on the campus to pick up twigs, little pieces of fallen limbs.      The campus wasn't as well kept as it it now,  so little twigs were left on the ground  for a while.    At that time the President's office was in what was known as the Old Alumni Building,    And  this was about twilight,  and Mr,   Chase and  his Berryhill 7 secretary,   Claude Corrie,happened  to be looking out the window.    And Mr.   Chase said  to Mr.  Corrie,"What is that out there?"    We looked, like peasant women with our heads covered up. M.F.: [Laughter] Berryhilli And   Claude Corrie,  that I had. known very wellhe was a personal friend  of minecame out and  was amazed  to find  that I was the person that looked like a peasant woman there picking up twigs. So he went back to Mr.  Chase and  told  him what it was,  that we had  no wood  and we were just getting what we could, for our rooms.    By the time we got back with our load  of twigs,  we found  a load  of wood  arriving at the Archer House to be taken up to our rooms. M.F.:  That's quick service. Berryhill: Yes.    Mr.   Chase was like that.    And  so was Claude Corrie. M.F.:  That's quite a story that's been written up in several of the histories of the women in the University.    I've seen it before. No names,   though.    Just the two figures were seen out in the woods. Did you ever participate in that battle for Spencer Hall? Berryhill: No.    Actually we heard very little about it. M.F.: Why is that, do you think? Berryhill j Part of the battle had  gone on before I got here.    And then I was so involved in ray own affairs that I didn't feel very much involved  in that. M.F.j Did  most of the other women students feel the same way you did? Berryhillj I think there were only just a few who had  an active part in it. Berryhill 8 M.F.j Did you ever live in Spencer Hall? Berryhill* Oh, no.    That didn't open till after I had left. I had. two very rare experiences when I was in the University.    Of course,  I was on a small scholarship,  and. nobody except a person with great faith would have given up a job and  come, not really knowing where the finances were coming from.    But I was so determined, that I came.    And  the house nother announced  one day in the dining room that they needed  a tutor for a sixth grade girl who was in bed. and  not able to go to school.    Well,  I rose immediately and  went to find out about it. It turned out to be Dr. L.  R.  Wilson's daughter.    And I went down and taught Penelope the sixth grade for that year.    And   to be in Dr.  and Mrs.  Wilson's home in that intimate way for a year was a good  part of education. M.F.j   Could  you go into some of that,  please?    I think it would  be very interesting.    Did you all have discussions on various topics? Berryhill:   They were being very businesslike people.    As you know, Dr.  Wilson was.    There wasn't ever any small talk.    But it was just the atmosphere in the home.    And Penelope being a very bright girl,  she kept me on my toes to keep up with her and  see that lesson plans were made and  that she got a proper sixth grade education.    So that there wasn't time for any small talk;  it was serious business.    But they were very interested  in seeing that I was properly cared  for in coming and  going, They didn't have a car.    They always used  a taxi,  as they do now,  I believe.    And  when there was the slightest drizzle,  Mrs.  Wilson would insist upon calling a cab.    I don't think I ever accepted  one,  because,  strangely, Berryhill 9 I liked to walk in the rain.    So I always outwitted, her about calling a taxi and managed  to go under my own steam.    But the money from teaching that year saw me through easily. Then the next year I guess my reputation had gotten abroad  a little bit.    Dr. Archibald  Henderson called  and asked  if I would   come and  teach Barbara.    Now that was really fun.    I learned more from teaching Barbara than Barbara learned  from teaching me. M.F.j  What kind of household did Dr.  Henderson have at that time? Berryhill j Mrs.  Henderson was not well,  so I don't believe I ever saw her while I was teaching.    I did  meet her one time and  another socially, but I don't believe I ever saw her during the period. I was teaching Barbara.    But Dr.  Hend arson frequently came in and worked crossword  puzzles with us.    And  I must say that Barbara was more helpful with the words for the crossword  puzzles than I. M.F.j What age was she? Berryhill: Barbara was in sixth grade.    Eleven or twelve. M.F.j Did. you keep in touch with her over the years that you stayed in Chapel Hill,  these girls that you had tutored when they were very young? Berryhill: Oh, yes.    I still see them, M.F.: I didn't know they were both still here. Berryhilli Penelope Wilson and. Barbara Henderson. M.F.j You mentioned  you had  seen Mrs.  Henderson at several social occasions.    I was hoping you could, tell me something about the social life for some of those first coeds on campus. Berryhill 10 Berryhill:  This was very much involved with the sorority affair, and. I'm sure you've heard  about that. M.F.:  Were you a Chi Omega or a Pi Phi? Berryhillj I was a Pi Phi. M.F.j One of the charter members? Berryhillj I was among the first initiated  at the first initiation. Not the charter ones, but the first group after the charter ones that were initiated.    And  that was great,  because the older girls,  the charter members,  Frances Venable, Dorothy Greenlaw,  Jane Toy,  Bet Branson,  took the new members very seriously.    And  we were in their homes many times, which was a rich experience.    To know Dr.  and Mrs.   Venable and Dr.  and Mrs.  Branson and Dr.  and Mrs.  Greenlaw was something very special.    And. of course Dr.  and  Mrs.  Toy,  we lived  next door for a while,  and. I knew them so very, very well in later years. M.F.j  What about social activities?    Were the girls in the sororities involved with one another in,  say, dances or meeting some of the men on the Carolina campus? Berryhill j I didn't have many dates,  I can assure you.    The men didn't pay too much attention to the girls,  certainly not to me.    I liked the way they accepted us. M.F.j How did  they accept you?    I remember reading somewhere about one of the first coeds going into a classroom and  suddenly occupying one or two benches entirely by herself.    Did  you receive that same kind of treatment at first and  then it changed.,  or .   .   . Berryhill: I was never conscious of it.    I was completely ignored,  if not Berryhill 11 accepted, as one of them.    I liked  this particularly because of the experience that I had. had  in Raleigh.    In those days,  the Peace College girls were marched, to church in a line.    And  the State College boys would line up on either side of the sidewalk as we were marched, to church and  from church and  make personal  comments that were very-embarrassing.    And. I was embarrassed because I thought.   ...    At that time State College was more of an agricultural school,  and I, having had. an agricultural background  and  six brothers,  felt that somebody somewhere along the line should have seen to it that those boys had  better manners. And  I resented, it very,  very greatly.    And  to come into this atmosphere where you were either accepted  or ignored  and  never insulted was very refreshing.     The only time I ever once had  side comments made to me, on a beautiful spring day I was walking to  class after lunch.    And on the wall from the Archer House through where the music building is now, it was a library there and   then the School of Pharmacy was next door, which is Person Hall,  there were a group of pharmaceutical students on the steps of Pharmacy.    And. I had. picked, a wild  single rose from the wall as I had walked by on a spring day and. had  it in my hand.    And as I walked  by,   this group of boys sang "My Wild  Irish Rose."    I wasn't insulted;  I wasn't flattered; I sort of wish it could happen to me now,  and  I'd   turn around, and  bow. M.F.j  [laughter] Berryhill j But in those days,  being very timid,  I just quietly walked by.    I'm sure I blushed  a bit. M.F.j That is a marvelous story.    You said  that Dr. Odum had been the Berryhill 12 one who brought you to the University, offered you the scholarship. Berryhillj Yes. M.F.j So I take it you were studying specifically sociology at this time, Berryhilli Yes. M.F.j What did  you plan to do with that sociology degree?    Did  you have a type of social work mapped, out in your mind? Berryhillj No,  I didn't,  because I was sort of feeling my way.    I didn't know. M.F.j  How was the program structured  at that point? Berryhillj Mostly for case workers,  county social workers and case workers.    And  I got interested  in working with girls fairly early. And  when I graduated, Dr. Odum really found, a job for me.    He loaned me a University car, believe it or not,  and. I went up to Leaksville-Spray,  which is now  83 en,   to be interviewed  by the people in the mill there who were.   .  .  .      There are three mills there,  Marshall Field  and then the Karastan rugs and  then another one.    And  they had joined together and  established, what they called  the Girls'  Club,  which was really for adult education for the girls who worked in the mill.    And there were showers there.    Of course,  there was no indoor plumbing in any of the mill houses.    The girls could come at any time to take showers.    And  there were classes in cooking and  sewing,  and  any problems they had  they were apt to come and. discuss with me,  and  I hoped  to help them work it out as best I could. M.F.j  What was the position you held? Berryhill: I was called Director of the Girls'  Club,    And it was Berryhill 13 there that I knew Luther Hodges so well.    Luther and Martha became very good friends of mine.    He was working in the Marshall Field Mills at that time. M.F.: In what capacity was he? Berryhill:  He was on the way up under tha Director.    And  it was very plain that he was on the way up. M.F.j In your work with that Girls'   Club,  were you responsible and involved, mostly with the mill owners themselves,  or did  you have a lot to do with the community and various groups in the community there? Berryhillj I only worked with the girls.    And  I went into the mills and. knew the superintendents and  the foremen,  but I chiefly worked, with the girls. M.F.j Did you do a lot of counseling at that time? Berryhill: Yes. M.F.j Of what sort, usually?    I'd   just be curious to know. Berryhillj With home problems.    Girls who had  ambition for further education. M.F.j  Were you able to develop a system whereby you could, help them? Berryhill j  I had. had  no training in counseling at that point,  so I guess you would only call it friendly advice.    I realized  soon,  after I*d  been there for a year and  had become so involved  with the girls personally,  that if I didn't get out I'd stay there the rest of my life. At that time I was engaged  to this young doctor that I had  met at the University,  and  I was anxious not to get so involved  in that community that I committed  the rest of my life to it.    So I started looking around Berryhill 14 for some other form. While I'd been in the University, I had worked, in the summer school with Mr. Comer in the Y, and my chief job working in the Y was to arrange social activities for the women teachers (because they were mostly women) who had. come. And in those days people stayed here over the weekends, so there were dances arranged, fashion chows, skits, fiddlers' conventions, anything to amuse people on Saturday nights. I did so much chaperoning of dancing that I felt I never wanted to see anybody dance, to say nothing of dancing, again. M.F.j Was it the University or the community who sponsored these events at this point? Berryhill; No. This was entirely the University summer school. I did this for three summers. And. the last summer I was here in this capacity I did a lot of work with Mrs. Stacy in her office. During one of the summers I was here I met Dr. and. Mrs. Garringer from Charlotte. Dr. Garringer was Principal of the Central High School, and I saw a fair amount of them. And. he told me one day that if I would go to Columbia and take the course in counseling and guidance, that he would employ me as Dean of Girls in the Central High School in Charlotte. Nothing else was ever said about it after that until I had spent my year in Leaksville-Spray (now %en) and gone to New York, got a job in a settlement house working with foreign girls, and did. graduate work at Columbia under Miss Sturdivant in guidance and counseling. And. after Christmas I wrote him and told him that I had done what he had suggested, and. I'd. be ready to cone to work the next September, and. he Berryhill 15 sent me a contract. M.F.: That was a contract for the school in Charlotte. Berryhilli Yes. M.F. j What was your reaction to being involved, with the settlement house up in New York? Berryhillj Oh,   that was the greatest fun,  the greatest,  greatest fun. M.F.j  How did  it compare,  in terms of your duties and  the girls you helped, with your work at the mill? [interruption] Berryhill: I went to New York for the first time in the spring of that year,   '26,  and after seeing an advertisement in the Survey about wanting a stud ent to work .   .   . BVSES SID? II TAPE I Berryhill j I had. a very definite arrangement with the head, worker at %st Side Settlement House,  which was at 76th Street and   %st River, that I wanted   to work with foreign girls,  and  she promised  me that this would  be what I was doing.    When I arrived  at the settlement she looked at me and  saw that I was a good,  strong,  healthy person,  and  talking with me she learned  I'd  had  six brothers and  she knew more about my background .    She d ecid ed she had a d iff erent plan for me.    She wanted me to work with the boys instead of the girls,  the pre-teenage and early teenage boys.    And   I,  being rather timid, didn't object, So  the first assignment I had  was to direct a club of these little %st Side boys.    It was the first meeting of the club of the Berryhill 16 fall,  and  Hiss Hart,  the head  worker,  went with me to  the club meeting. There were about thirty boys there,  with foreign names, mostly middle European.    And  coming from North Carolina, which was at that time ninety-nine and  ninety-nine one-hundredths percent pure Anglo-Saxon, I'd  never heard many foreign names.    And  I certainly couldn't pronounce them.     She asked  me to call the roll.     Well,   she soon gave up on that and   took it over herself.    And   then she said,   "Well,  I'll leave you now, and you can do what you want to do with these boys."    And  the boys rose up almost of one accord  and  said,  "Let's bowl.    Let's bowl."    Well,  I didn't know what bowling was;  I'd  never heard  of bowling.    And  so  I said,   "All right,  let's bowl.     Show me how."    And  so they set up the pins and  got ready and  "Teacher,  she go first.    Teacher,  she go first." And  I said,  "Well,  tell me what to do,  because I don't know what to do." So they told  me the proper stance and  gave me the ball.    And  you won't believe this,  but every one of the pins went down. M.F.:  [Laughter] Berryhill:  I don't believe it myself,  but that happened.    Now they may have rigged  it so they knew that it would  happen;   I don't know.     I still don't know enough about it to know.    But I was kingpin after that.    The teacher,  she was fine.    But I wasn't fine,  and  after the meeting of the club that day I went to  the head  worker and  said,  "You promised  me that I could  work with girls.    I know nothing about these boys.    I don't know what to do with them,  and  I want to work with girls."    And she said, "All right, you can.    I'll do that.    But there's one more thing I want you to do.    The World  Series is going on,  and  we have complimentary tickets for these thirty boys.    And  tomorrow I want you Berryhill 17 to take them to the Polo Grounds to the World  Series."    And  I said, "I can't possibly do it.    I've only ridden on the subway once or twice. I don't know how to get there.    I can't manage these boys.    I don't want to do it."    And  she said,  "Well,  tonight there's a young graduate from the University of Texas coming in,  and he's going to take over these boys,  and he'll go with you and  help you."    Well,  sure enough,  the young Texan arrived, and he was more ignorant than I and knew less about what to do than I knew.    But, being softhearted  and  timid,  I went along with the thirty boys and  my timid little friend,  who really wanted  to sort of hold my hand [laughter], and we got to the Polo Grounds and got to our seats.    And  the little boys just went wild.    But there were a marvelous group of gentlemen nearby who sensed the situation intuitively, and  so they came to my rescue and sort of parceled out the little boys and  helped  me with them.    And  when the game was over,  we got back to the subway, and when we arrived at the place to get off the subway we had  to transfer to a bus.    And  then when we got to the bus,  it was pouring down rain.    So the little boys each ran his own way,  and  I [laughter] ran back to the settlement house.    By this time,  I wasn't timid  anymore,  and  told  the head worker I was through with boys. So the next day she let me have a group of girls. M.F.:  Before you go into your work with the girls there,  you had mentioned  that your training had been to work with girls.    Was that program at Columbia directed  that way? Berryhill: Yes. M.F.: How did they phase out working with young boys entirely? Berryhill 18 I'm just interested  in the focus of the program. Berryhill: Of course,  this young man from Texas took over,  and he had  to have some help later, but that was their problem.    Not only did I work with the girls,  but they found  later that they could use me very well working with the young women who came in,  not necessarily so young, middle European.    And  what the women wanted   to do all the time was dance; that's all they wanted, to do.    And  I must say that dancing with a middle European is very different from dancing with a college boy,  and  much more fun,  because they had  music in their bones. M.F.j  This was folk dancing,  then. Berryhill j No, it was ballroom dancing. They wanted to dance, and they danced and towed me along [laughter] as if they were tugboats, but it was fun. M.F.j  What other kind, of duties did  you hold at the settlement house, in terms of specifically working with the girls?    Were you an instructor, or guidance work?    What-all did it entail? Berryhillj At one period I had  a class in teaching English to foreigners who had  recently arrived  who were working for their citizenship papers.    This was a very different type of person from the people who usually came to the settlement school.    Sometimes they were graduates of universities in Exrope.    I remember one particular young graduate from a German university who had  come to this country for an engineering job.    And,  having little money, he found  out about the settlement school, where his teaching would be free.    And  I must say it was certainly a joy to see one pick up the language as quickly as he did. M.F.j Did. you get involved with any kind  of political work at that time? Berryhill 19 I'm thinking of the immigration laws that people were trying to enact in the early twenties, Berryhillj No. M.F.j Why didn't you?    It seems to me it would have been right along your alley. Berryhill:  I was so completely consumed.    I was carrying a full load  at graduate school and doing this at night,  so my time was so completely consumed  and  I was so completely consumed  that there wasn't time for this. M.F.:  That certainly will take up your time.    I didn't realize the graduate work and   the settlement work were juxtaposed. Berryhill j Yes,  I was carrying a full graduate load  and   then the settlement work in the late afternoon and  the evening. M.F.j How long did  you stay at the settlement house to work? Berryhill: For a year: a fulltime school year,  then a summer. M.F.:  What did  you do then? Berryhill:  Then is when I went to pick up my job in Charlotte as Dean of Girls.    And  I was the first dean of girls in a high school. Now they don't dignify this by calling it a dean of girls,  which is proper; they are counselors. M.F.: And  how many girls were you in charge of there?    Was it a large high school? Berryhill:  Very.    It was the senior high school in Charlotte then, Of course, Charlotte was a much smaller city then than now, but it was the only city senior high school in Charlotte, M.F.:  When did  you come to Chapel Hill permanently?    All this has Berryhill 20 run you almost up to the 1930's. Berryhill:  In the summer of 1930,  we were married.    And  I had  just finished  my summer working in Chapel Hill that summer.    And  then we went to Cleveland  for three years,  where my husband  was first a resident in medicine and   then an instructor.    We came back here in '33. M.F.:  How did  Mr.  Berryhill react to all your years first in  E3en, then in New York,  then in Charlotte?    Was he supportive usually?    I don't mean to lead   the question quite that way,  but I'd  be curious as to his attitude at that time towards your work. Berryhill:  The same as it's always been toward  my work.    He's been interested   in my ideas and  my adventuresome spirit,   and  it didn't occur to him.   ...    He accepted  that along with me.    And  besides,  if he hadn't been supportive,  he was so involved  himself with his residency in Boston that he didn't have time to worry about me,  because he had  a pretty exacting.   ...    He graduated  here in a two-year school in  '25 and  went to Harvard  and  graduated  there in '27 and had  a residency there in the Boston City Hospital, where he was having high adventure himself.    So what I was doing seemed   tame to him,   I'm sure. M.F.: What about the change in your status once you became a married woman?    Did  you work while you were in Cleveland? Berryhill: Yes,  I had  a fascinating job in Cleveland.    This was Depressionthis was 1930and  in the depths of the Depression.    You remember it started  in October of  '29.    And  jobs were few and  far between, but I had  to have a job.    So,  speaking of pounding the pavement,   I pounded  the pavement for the month of August.    My feet grew a whole size. My trousseau shoes had  been one size [laughter],  and  by the time I started Berryhill 21 to work,  I needed  a size larger.    I had  walked  that much, looking for a job,  and  landed  a perfect one working with the Girls'  Bureau with Sabina Marshall,  who was really a pioneer in working with women. M.F.: What type of work was this? Berryhill:  It was really an agency working with delinquent girls. And  when I went in,   I wore civilian clothes.     But before the period  when I was employed by the Girls'  Bureau,  there were women police.    My boss, Sabina Marshall, had been a woman policeman herself.    And  I was working with delinquent girls. M.F.:  What type of work did you do with these girls? Berryhill:  Supposedly taking them off the street and  finding jobs for them as I could.    And  the only possible place that they could  find employment then was as mothers'  helpers.    So I interviewed  women who couldn't afford  the type of maidservant that they had  usually had,  but who could  accept mothers'  helpers.    And  this is the majority of what I did.    This was really doing social work with a case load,  and  to follow up,  so it meant travelling into the homes of these girls,  and. in the worst type of slum, many of them. [interruption] Berryhill:  I was a social worker with the Girls'  Bureau. M.F.: How did  the parents receive you as a female social worker? Berryhill: Most social workers were female,  and  it depended  upon how severe the delinquency was and  how much trouble the girls had gotten into,  whether the parents were resentful or whether they were appreciative. I remember one occasion.    A girl had been missing for a long time, a matter of months,  and  her father had  attempted  suicide.    And  it was Berryhill 22 very important that we find  that girl.    And  I had  gotten a tip that she could  be found  at a certain address.    And  when I got there to this address,  I discovered  it was a speakeasy,  but I went in to see if I could  locate this girl.    And   just as I got into the room,    the police closed  in;  it was being raided.     They wondered  why I was there,  but wouldn't listen to me.    They loaded  up everybody in the paddy wagon except me.    And. when I explained  to one of the police,  who believed  me and  I had  records in my hand  to convince himthen I crawled  into the paddy wagon to get the signature.    And. when I did,  one of the police caught hold of my coat tail and. pulled me back and  said,  "If you don't want to go down to the station, you get out."    And  I said,  "Well,  I have to get this signature.    It's a matter of life and death."    And  he said, "Well,  you go to the station."    And  he told me which station he was taking her to.    So when I got to the station,  I was able to get the signature. M.F.: Amazing. Berryhillj Well, it was a rough life,  a rough life.    And one night my husband and I had  a perfectly marvelous time in Cleveland, because the old  Western Reserve families were interested  in the hospital and took on the young residents and. their families and  the interns and their families as their special project and. interest and   entertained, us in their home.    And one family, who spent the winter in south Georgia, had box tickets to the symphony.    And we were given these tickets while they were out of town.    And  Reece and  I were dressed  in formal clothes to go to the symphony when my boss called me and said,  "A girl you're looking for is at this address.    Go and get her now."    You can imagine Berryhill 23 the frame of mind  my husband, was in.    You asked  about his being supportive.    This night he was not very supportive;  he was very upset. We had  already called  a taxiof course,  we had  no carand  gave the address to the taxi driver,  who looked  very doubtful about it and  wanted to know why we wanted  to go there,  and  I told  him.    When I got out to go upstairs in this building,  Reece got out to follow me.    The taxi driver said,  "She will be safe there by herself,  but if you go she won't be safe and  you won't be safe.    And  if you go with her,  I'm going to leave you both here,  because I don't want to get involved."    So Reece timidly sat in the taxi and waited,  and  I got my girl,  and we took her to the sort of detention place,  Snow House,  where these girls lived  while they waited  to find, something better for them to do.    We went on to the symphony late. M.F.j [Laughter] Berryhillj  That's one of the few times in my life when my husband was not supportive. M.F.t Mrs.  Berryhill,  you've characterized  yourself as timid  on several occasions,  and  I just don't see how that fits with all the activities that you were involved, in and  the work you did. Berryhill: I shed  it as I went along. M.F.j  Could you characterize yourself at,  say,  that point in your life when you did  come to Chapel Hill to stay in 33?    What type of person would  you have said  you were? Berryhill:  When women talk about being free,  I don't know what they're talking about,  because I was born free.    And  though I may have been a bit shy and  timid,  underneath I knew I was an individual and  free to Berryhill 24 do what I really wanted  to do.    I didn't have very much experience,  and I was certainly naive in the beginning,  but innately I am shy and  timid in new experiences.    But I shed  it quickly. M.F.:  The suffrage movement would  have been reaching its completion about the time you finished   college,  with the Amendment in '22.    Did  you find  yourself taking, not an active role,  because clearly your time was in other activities,  but did you vote whenever you had  the chance?    Were you interested, in political issues in just a personal way? Berryhill:  I was interested  academically,  but not actively.    I can't remember the first time I voted ; I really can't.    But I moved  around  a good bit,  as you will see,  and  so I didn't settle down to taking an active, role in being concerned  about who was elected, or what bills were passed  until I arrived back as a resident of Chapel Hill. M.F.: And  that was in 1933. Berryhill:  Yes. [interruption] Berryhill: I had. an experience with Dr.  Odum that was very meaningful to me. M.F.: While you were in summer school,  or when you were here as a regular student? Berryhill j My first fall in summer school.    Reece was a friend, of mine,  and  he had  a friend  that was also a friend  of mine,  Pop Haselidge, who became a doctor up in West Virginia.    He had. a stripped-down Ford., and. he, being a serious medical stud ent,  had  no use for it.    And  he said, to me one day,  "Norma,  if you ever want my stripped-down Ford, I'd. be glad  to lend  it to you."    And  I,  being very adventuresome,  said, Berryhill 25 "Fine.    I'd  like to borrow it sometime."    So he parked  it up,  parking being no problem in the University.    He said,  "Well,  I don't have anywhere to leave it especially,  so I'll just leave it with you and  you can use it whenever you want to."    There was a movie in Durham that sounded  very intriguing.    I didn't have a class.    And  I really at that point,  I'm afraid,  felt that if you didn't have a class,  you had  no responsibility.    So  Cara Mae Green and  I got the stripped-down Ford. M.F.j  That's Mrs. Paul Green? Berryhillj No,  she goes by the name of Cara Mae Russell now. We got into the stripped-down Ford   and. went to Durham to the movie, And when I got back and parked   the Ford,  the housemother said  to me, "You had  a caller this afternoon,  and  he asked  me to give you a message that he thought that was a lovely car that you were using these days. He envied  you that car."    And. I asked  for a description of the gentleman, and  it turned  out to be Dr. Odum.    He never had  to remind, me that there was studying and  research to do [laughter] again.    And  from that time on, I became a very serious student. M.F.j Moving on to when you did   come in Chapel Hill,  I have one prefatory question.    In all your work with these various girls'  groups and  clubs,  you already made the point that there was no community involvement with the girls'  club in S3 en that the mill owners ran. Berryhillj Yes. M.F.j  But I was wondering more about the one in Cleveland  and  in New York.    Did  you hear of or know of,  or did  any of these women's clubs in the cities help in any way with these projects? Berryhill 26 Berryhill: Oh, yes,  the Girls'  Bureau in Cleveland was one of the social agencies that was supported  by the United  Fund  or the equivalent thereof, with a board of directors.    And I had. a special group of the board, of directors who worked with me that I could go to with problems. M.F.:  Were there women on these board, of directors? Berryhill:  Women and men,  chiefly women.    Cleveland  in those days was a very socially conscious community.    Cleveland was a very strange city in that,  at that time,  the people that were doing that kind of thing were in the minority and  the old. Western Preservers, mostly,  or descendants of them.    And  they were very possessive and  felt the responsibility to the newly arrived  foreign group who were there. The Cleveland. Symphony and  the Cleveland Museum and. many other activities of that sort were strongly sponsored by this group of people.    And since then,  I understand,  it's a very different city.    But we haven't been back there in recent years.    Our friends in Cleveland  come to see us,  rather than us going to see them. M.F.: Let's move now to 1933 and Chapel Hill.    How did  it compare to the Chapel Hill you'd  known five or ten years earlier? Berryhill j It was much the same.    You really knew everybody.    And.   , as I've said,  if you walked, down the street and. met somebody you didn't know,  you ducked  into the next door and  said,  "Who was that person?" Chapel Hill remained, much that waynot entirely,  but much that way until the Pre-Flight group came in. M.F.j And  that was during World War II. Berryhillj  The beginning of World  War II.    And  then the influx of all sorts and. kinds of groups of people came, and you just got totally lost Berryhill 27 when it came to knowing everybody.    Not only did  you know the white group,  but you knew the Negroes also. M.F.j How would you characterize the early conditions of black-white relations in Chapel Hill? Berryhill:  So far as I could  ever feel,  they were very serene, very friendly.    I'm sure underneath they were seething, but never to the surface. M.F.: Did. you have black servants in your home? Berryhill: I had. one young woman for several years.    And  I'm ashamed  to tell you what I paid, her,  very ashamed  to tell you.    She didn't work fulltime, but I paid her three dollars a week.    This has been on my conscience from then until now.    I started  about ten years ago,  when our own personal lot became easier,  looking for this girl, I looked, for her for nine years,  asking people in her old. community, asking the Negro ministers,  asking and asking.    The reason I wanted, her was because I wanted  to leave her in my will,  feeling very guilty.    She has been a lovely person.    She had. tuberculosis in her family,  and  I had been working with the tuberculosis group.    And. I had been in her home and. been through the death,  with her,  of several of her family who died  of tuberculosis.    So I was very much involved, with this person. And one day I was visiting in the home of a former servant, and. as I sat with her in her living room talking, I said, "Gertrude, I guess I'll have to give up my search for Inez.    I've been looking for her all this time,  and. I can't find her."    And. her brother on the front porch said, "Do you mean Inez Massey?" and  I said, "Yes."    And he said, "I know Inez. Berryhill 28 I know where you can find  her.    Inez and my sister were good  friends." BE3IN SIDE I  TAPE II Berryhilli  I got her address and  wrote to her.    She had  been living in Cleveland  all this time I'd  been looking for her.    Her husband  had. died  in Cleveland,  and. she'd  moved to Durham with a sister of hers. And. I wrote to her and. told her what I wanted,  and. she wrote back to me and we made an appointment.    Gertrude,   to whom I have referred   earlier a former cleaning woman,  reallyand  her sister,  who is Rosa,  who works at Huggins Hardware Store,  was a friend  of Inez,  had been in school with her.    So Rosa brought Gertrude and  Inez out to call on us.    I've never had  a better time.    I wish we'd had  a tape recorder then.    It was the most fun to have those three women remembering and  talking and. making fun of me in a light way when they worked  for me.    Reece came to speak to the three of them, of whom he had been very fond,  and.  expected  to get up and leave after he'd done his manners.    But he was so entranced  that he stayed for the whole visit.    And. I served   tea and  cake.    Gertrude was immensely interested  in this and  laughed, about the turning of their serving me tea in the past years and me serving them tea now.    I had decided,  earlier, before I knew Inez'  address,  that I would  not wait for my will,  but I would  send  her a check then.    And  I can assure you she was very grateful and  very surprised.    And  being a severe diabetic,  I'm sure she needed  it. And  I sleep better at night, M.F.j  What about the effects of the Depression on Chapel Hill when Berryhill 29 you came back? Were they obvious, or did you have to look pretty much into the society of the small town to be able to see them? Berryhillj  The salaries had  been cut terrifically.    Prices were very low, and people managed as best they could.    That particular group of university faculty had  a loyalty to the University and. a loyalty to North Carolina and  were possessive about both the University and  North Carolina.    And  they understood  why the salaries had  to be cut.    I can't remember any great bitterness about it.    People just did  what they had  to do as best they could,   and  what they couldn't do they just didn't bother to do.    People who had  recently bought homes on mortgages managed  to pay the interest on the mortgage and  let the rest ride until they could. I guess the years after the War Between the States and  the memory of that history hadn't been so far removed  that people still had  the spirit of getting along without.     *Ven then,  I took two dresses and made one for our little girls,  and. had  great joy in doing it. M.F.j  When did. you all start raising a family? Berryhillj  Our first daughter was born in        Cleveland  in January of '33,  so she was seven months old  when we came to  Chapel Hill.    And then Katherine was born two years later. M.F.j And  those were the only two children? Berryhillj   Yes. M.F.j  How did  you become involved  in activities in Chapel Hill? What I'm trying to find  out is,    was it a next-door neighbor who said, "Well, why don't you come do this?"    Girls you'd been in school or the sorority with,  that type of lead-in. Berryhill 30 Berryhill j I can't remember why I got involved.;  it was all so natural.    I belonged  to the Pi Phi    Alumnae Club for a number of years and. helped the girls with their rushing parties, did this sort of thing. But as our girls were in high school,  I could project myself and project them in the situation when they might be interested in joining a sorority.    And   I didn't want to be a part of it,  so I dropped  out of it very abruptly.    I felt then,  as I feel now,  that sororities are for students,  not for adults. M.F.j  Were there any other activities you were involved   in in your earlier years? Berryhill:  I guess the first community activity in which I was involved was the Christmas Seal sale for tuberculosis.    Mrs. Levitt had  been chairman of that since it had  been first started  in  Chapel Hill and  asked me in about  '35 to be chairman of the Christmas Seal sale, which I did.    And  after that I was on the board  until it was finally dissolved  a few years ago. M.F.j I know Mrs.  Levitt was in the Community Club. Berryhill:  Yes. M.F.:  Was the actual tuberculosis Christmas seal sale itself a function of the Community Club? Berryhill: No,  that was entirely separate,  operated  from state headquarters. M.F.j  What about involvements with other University women you'd been in school with?    Did  you see them often?    Were many of them Wt in the community? Berryhill:  The ones that I had  known here I saw,  and  Chapel Hill Berryhill 31 was a small,  friendly place,  so we just naturally dropped  into the grouping. The next activity I was conscious of being involved  with,  as I think of it now,  was the Medical Wives.    There wasn't at that time a Durham-Orange Medical Auxiliary.    But I gathered  into our home the doctors'  wives of the communitythere weren't very manyand  friends in Durham who were doctors'  wives,  who came to our house for coffee every spring.    And  then from that the Durham-Orange Auxiliary was reactivated. It had  been active a number of years before and  then had died.    And from that I was interested  in the state auxiliary and  later asked  to be the State President of the Women's Auxiliary. M.F.j  What else was occupying your time during these years?    Were you working also? Berryhill: I didn't have a paid  job,  but I was always involved with something,  it seems to me.    At this point,  when the War was over or even during the War,  the idea came back of the expansion (the idea had  been there all the time,  but it was being made more active) of the Medical School from a two-year school into a four-year school.    When the President, Mr.  Graham,  invited  Reece to  come back to Chapel Hill on the faculty,  there was in that contract a clause that part of his responsibility would be to work on expanding the Medical School.    And that was really the reason that we came back from Cleveland.    We were both extremely happy in Cleveland,   extremely happy,  and didn't want to leave.    And  I couldn't have stood  to have left Cleveland  to go anywhere else in the world   except to come back to Chapel Hill.    But I was interested in this endeavor,  and  I have been very fortunate through the years in Berryhill 32 having a husband  who would  share his interest with me.    So what he was interested  in became my chief interest.    As medical leaders through the state who caught on to the dream of having an expanded  medical school would   come to our home to lunch,   to breakfast,  for dinner,  in the Depression we had  no money;  there was no expense account; our salaries were very small.    And we entertained   in our home.    And  I kept a diary through all of the years of who came for dinner, who came for lunch,  who came for breakfast, who came to spend  the night,  and  sometimes I even wrote what I fed  them,  which has been very interesting when I get a chance to go back through them.    [Laughter]    So I knew,  and  our children knew,  these leaders who came to give their endeavor to this project. M.F.j  How much did  the Medical School expand during those first years? Berryhill j  There was a lot of history before it expanded..    It took a long,  long time to do it. M.F.j I meant as a result of your and Dr.  Berryhill's efforts. Berryhilli Our efforts were only a part of.   .   .   .    His part was the leading part,  I think,  in rounding up other interested people, medical leaders,  through the state and  the Medical Society in the state. And it took a long time; there had  to be a number of commissions appointed. I think probably the most meaningful one was the one called  the Broughton Commission.    And I may sound  sort of vague with this, but it's all sort of jumbled  together.    Reece has been so occupied  with writing this up,  getting ready for the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Medical School next year. Berryhill 33 M.F.j  Is he working on a book? Berryhill j  He's been collecting the history of the Medical School, and he's just about to finish,  polish a draft now to give to the printer for the centennial. M.F.: How, with all your activities as a mother,  as a helpmate to Dr.  Berryhill with the expansion of the Medical School, did  you find time for outside activities,  specifically starting the University Women's Club? Berryhill: It didn't take much time. We met once a month. There were marvelous committees working who did the work. And I have missed probably two University Women's affairs in these years. I go now, and to be sure I don't know everybody there,  but I go just the same. M.F.:  Who were some of the other women leaders who helped  start that Club? Berryhillj Mrs.   Connor,   Mrs.  House,  Mrs.  Rogerson,  Mrs. Linker, Mrs.   Edminster, Mrs.  Wettach, Mrs.  Rush.    I'm trying to select the ones now who were most active.    Mrs. Frank Hanft was very active, because she,  with her legal mind, wrote the constitution,  which was a great help. M.F.j Had. you all been involved  with the founding of the Newcomers' Club in '39,  or was that a separate group of women? Berryhillj  That was a separate group of women.  I was less active in the group then than now. M.F.j  But you are    all part of the Newcomers'   Club. Berryhilli  Yes,  we're all a part of it.    So far as the newcomers in the Medical School was concerned, before it was expanded,  always,  when Berryhill 34 we got new faculty,  we entertained  them.  " Entertaining"  to me is really sort of a dirty word.    I don't like it at all.    We invited  them into our homes and  saw to it that they met not only other people in the Medical School but other people in the community,  other people in the University.    Because my husband, and  I have both felt that the Medical School is only a part of the University,  and  we don't separate them in our minds too carefully. [interruption] M.F.j Mrs.  Berryhill,  you were telling me some about the formation of the University Women's Club and  how you always brought the new faculty /(in your case) members for the Medical School'into your homes so they could, meet new people and  whatnot.    What about the mechanics of setting up a new group? Was it difficult at that time,  and  how did  you go about doing it? Berryhillj It seemed very natural.    The new faculty came in,  a small number in the beginning,  and. we took them as they came.    And. I was    careful on moving day to be there if I    could  to see what could be done for them.    The group wrote a manual for the people invited   to join the faculty in the Medical School,  later including residents and. interns, or for anyone who was moving in who would  be interested  in having this. And  in this handbook about the mechanics of living in Chapel Hill .  .  . [interruption] Berryhill; Where to shop for groceries,  about the electric companies, the plumbers,  the drycleaners,  medical emergencies,  all the things that people need to know when they move into a community completely cold. M.F.j Was this mailed  out to the new faculty members? Berryhill 35 Berryhill:  This was mailed  out to the new faculty and  the new interns and  residents before they came,  and  several of them told me in later years that, before they went to their residence,  they rode around  town and  checked  it out to see about it,  and  they felt at home before they even got into their own house. M.F.j  Quite a compliment to your endeavor. Berryhill j  Well,  it wasn't my endeavor.    This was a collective achievement. M.F.j   %rlier you had. mentioned  a few of the problems you'd  had organizing and deciding what type of membership you wanted  in the University Women's dub.     Gould  you tell me what criteria you finally-settled  on? Berryhillj At first it was associate professors,  assistant professors,  and  professors.    Later,  and  very soon,  the librarians, head  technicians,  and  other women who had  responsible positions in the University.    And  still later,  residents in the hospital.    A little earlier than that, fulltime instructors in the University. M.F.j  Why did  you decide to start with such a limited membership? Berryhill j We were groping along,  and. it wasn't that we were discriminating against anybody.    I guess we wanted  to be an active, meaningful group before we expanded  ourselves too much.    It wasn't a conscious effort one way or the other.    At a university faculty women's club,  we would  get faculty. M.F.j  What has been the pattern of expansion for the Women's dub? Berryhill: That was pretty much it,  and   then later the branch Berryhill 36 organization,  the Newcomers group,  which has in recent years become a more active group than the University Women's dub,   though I think of us as being part of the same. Something that I enjoy very much is an organization of past Presidents of the University Women's dub.    We were organized  in '49 and   '50,  and  that means at this point a large number of past Presidents. We get together once a year for a luncheon meeting which is delightful. We all know each other at this point very well indeed,  and  we have some small talk,  but often very serious discussions about things about the University that we don't like and  wish could  be different,  and   try to und erstand, M.F.j Do you ever take any type of advocacy role on things you wish were a little different? Berryhillj  We haven't,  but I wish that we would.    I'm more aggressive in this than some of the rest of the members.    I guess with age you either lose all aggressiveness,  or you gain more; I think I have gained more.    At this point I don't mind  speaking up. M.F. j And. yet it has still remained  pretty much of a social organization. Berryhillj It's a social group, but a group that has real concern. One of the things about the University that we regret greatly is that we feel now that the faculty don't care as much about the University as the faculty did. even when we started  as a club in '49 and   '50.    Many of our facultyI can't remember the percentages,  but a very large percent of our facultyhave come so very recently,  and  they don't have the feeling for North Carolina nor the feeling of a loyalty to the University Berryhill 37 that many, many of us of an earlier group had.    And many people are coming in, we feel,  as we have expressed  in this group,  as a stepping-stone to something else.    And  it's changed  the atmosphere of the University a great d eal. M.F.j What kind of effect do you think this will have,  long-term, on Chapel Kill? Berryhill: I think it's very evident the effect it will have,  not to have as loyal a group.    I used  to think that being possessive was bad,  but I think that this group of early facultyaround   '50,  for instancewere very possessive of the University and  really cared  and really participated  in faculty meetings and  in faculty affairs,  University affairs, and really cared  about the State of North Carolina and felt possessive about North Carolina.     Certainly the Berryhills are very possessive,  to the point that we've been objectionable,  I'm sure.    But that's all right; let those object who want to.    And  people coming into the University cold  from other universities don't have this same feeling;  at least many of us think they don't. M.F.j How do you think a lot of the major social and  historical events of,  say,  the decade between 1955 through the 1970's have contributed or ameliorated  some of these effects?    I'm thinking in terms of the civil rights issue,  the labor wage dispute on campus during the late sixties,  the Vietnam War,   this type of thing. Berryhillj I can't really answer that. M.F.j Probably a poorly worded  question.    [Laughter] Berryhill:  I really can't answer that.    Of course, one has to /do grow always,  and  things happened so fast it was hard  to/enough growing Berryhill 38 to  cope with all of these problems. M.F.j Let's move back for a moment to something you had  said   earlier about the purpose of the University Women's dub.     You mentioned  being able to enumerate many of the city's services to new faculty members. Berryhillj I was speaking then of the handbook for new faculty or new groups coming into  the University. M.F.j I did notice in one history I looked at that later on it was said  that the group got too large,  and  that type of assistance was no longer feasible.     How did  you react to that? Berryhill: I don't think that was true.    I think that was a creeping lack of interest.    I think it's probably more necessary now to have new people who are coming into the University community have this information than it was then.    It seems that people are less willing to get involved, in doing this.    They're more interested  in their own affairs,  their own personal problems.    The attitude of women has changed a great deal,  as I have seen it particularly in the young medical group. Many of these younger women are either working,  going to school,  or have very young children,  and  they don't have the time for outside activities or outside concern,except in their own particular little narrow field, that we were able to have a generation earlier.    So I understand  this. I have great rapport with the very young women,  and  some of my close, close friends are these young women who are working,  going back to school, realizing that they could  be left on their own not only to support themselves but to support their children.    Many women of my period thought that marriage solved   everything,  and  women found   out   it didn't Berryhill 39 and  are facing it head  on.    And  these young women are so well organized that they can run their houses,  take good  care of their children,  be supportive of their husbands,  and  have a career on the side.    I couldn't do it, but I have young friends who are doing it beautifully.    They seem to have the wisdom to know what to cut out.    Of course,  this shouldn't be taken as a broad   statement;  there are exceptions.     But some of my young friends are doing this beautifully. M.F.:  Quite a compliment to them. Berryhill:  Yes.    And  I'm quite complimented   that they accept me as a friend. M.F.:  What about your involvement with the church?    Just a few moments ago a friend  of yours from the Presbyterian Church dropped  by, and  you made the observation that stub a toe,  and  somebody from the church is at your door the next day with a casserole for you. Berryhill:  This is the group of women in the Presbyterian Church, and  this is the church that I know about,  a very active group,  a very caring group. A group in which I'm involved now that is most meaningful to me is a church circle,  which is a splinter of the Women of the Church. We have serious Bible study and  serious social concern discussions at each monthly meeting. M.F.:  How long have you been an active member? Berryhill:  I've been an active member in this for many years. I haven't particularly gone along with the leadership in this church, but find  that for religious meaningfulness to me,  that the Women of the Church group is where I get my satisfaction.    And  we do have a group Berryhill 40 of women in the church who are very fine Bible scholars who take the leadership in guiding us,   though they try to get us neophytes to take active parts in the study,  too, meaning to take the leadership in Bible study. M.F.:  You've been in Chapel Hill through the time period  that has seen not only the University expand   to the point that it had   to be frozen in size several years ago,  but also the era of the most active women's groups that any of the local history books can record.    What is your evaluation on the work done with them?    I know you've been involved  with the University Women's dub,   to a great deal with the Hospital Auxiliary. Obviously you have been involved   and  gone back and  gotten reinvolved, from looking at some of the sheets of officers in the 1970's.     What .   .   . BE3IN SIDE II  TAPE II M.F.: What do you think about the work these groups have done in town over the years? Berryhill:  It isn't that I have been active and then become inactive and  gone back.    Any contribution I have made has been in the background, and when I haven't been an officer doesn't mean that I haven't been extremely active in that organization.    But I discovered   earlier that my chief contribution was a background   contribution,  and  some of the young women hold  it against me.    They say I twisted  their arms to make them take leadership that they hadn't wanted   to.    They've later said they were glad  that I did  it.    But I've tried   to  encourage other people, younger people,  to take the leadership role,  rather than to do things Berryhill 41 that I'd  been asked  to do.    I have never been an officer in the Hospital Auxiliary,  but I was there mapping it out early in the day,  long before the Hospital was open.    And  I didn't think that I should   take an active leadership in the form of an office, because of my husband's position in the Medical School and  in the Hospital,  and  I think I was right about that. M.F.:  Why did   you choose not to go back to work? [interruption] M.F.:   .   .   .   thirties? Berryhill:  I was busy at home,  and  I felt needed  at home.    I felt that I couldn't do the supportive job if I'd  been away from home.    I remember in the very early days,  we'd  been back here three or four years, and  I decided  that I would  get a graduate degree and  started  back to school.    We lived  in the Gimghoul section at that time,  and  I was walking to the campus.    My husband   telephoned  me one day.    I didn't answer,  so he got in the car and   came to meet me and  met me halfway to the campus.    And  he said,  "I'm sorry to tell you,  but Dr.  So-and-so is here,  and  I've invited  him for lunch.    Can you do it?"    And  I said, "Yes,"  and  I went back.    Two days later the same thing happened.  "Dr. So-and-so  (who was one of these state leaders in medicine that Reece was trying to get interested  in this expansion business)    is going to be here tonight with his wife.     Can you have them for dinner and  have them spend  the night?"    "Yes."    So it meant going back.    This happened a third  time over a period of about two weeks,  so I decided  that graduate work wasn't for me.    And I was much more interested  in what I was doing and  in the daughters and other things,  and  I didn't feel the Berryhill 42 necessity of doing it. M.F.; Did  you find your club work fulfilling? Berryhill:  Yes. [interruption] M.F.j  I have just one other historical interest question,  which concerns me personally because I guess I just grew up in the town during that era,  also.    It's the civil rights issue.    What did. it seem, to someone who'd  been in town since 1933,  was happening in the sixties,  first with parly the integration in the very/sixties (I believe it was  *60,   '6l,   '62) and then later, with a lot of racial agitation and developing consciousness? How did. it look to you? Berryhillj Let me begin this.   .   .   .    We're talking about the black-white situation,  as far as you're concerned.    I don't like the word "black."    I always used  the word "Negro."    To me "Negro," with a capital "N,"  is a beautiful word, with dignity,  and  I resent the young Negroes who didn't appreciate this who wanted  to  change it.    In recent years    I have talked with a number of Negroes about this, who are leaders,  educated people,  people who are not so educated  but solid  citizens,  and  they agree with me.    I mean the Negroes themselves agree with me,  and   they attribute the use of the term "black"  to the young agitators rather than the established, members of the race,  who prefer the term "Negro."    Many people don't understand, my feeling about this.    We have never,  in our home, allowed  the word  that I don't use;  I will spell itj  "nigger."    My mother never allowed  it.    I was brought up in a county that was seventy-five percent Negro,  and  at a later date the percentage was higher in the school-age group.    I was brought up with and  by Negroes.    I never felt Berryhill 43 anything but the greatest warmth to them.    I understood  them;  I felt that they understood  me.    I'm not naive enough to  think that there wasn't seething and  resentment beneath that didn't show on the surface. I did resent many people from other communities who had  no feeling, as I had,  coming in trying to tell us what to do,  the Johnny-come-lately's telling us what to do in the South.     I was not active in the movement,  but I did go to see and  tell several of my Negro friends that if they ever got into trouble,  to come to my house and  I would  protect them.    These were the solid   citizens that the young Negroes were calling "Uncle Tom"'s. M.F.j Do you think things have settled  somewhat now? Berryhill:  I think they've settled   considerably.    I still think they're seething among the very young,  but it seems to me that things are on a much more even keel.    I don't believe that it will  ever be settled, within the memory of this even youngest generation,  if there's any settlement for it,  any happy solution for it,  any more than there is in the Middle  %st between the Aaabs and  the Jews,   that there'll always be a problem.    But I think we can live with it,  and  the future generations can learn to live with it without destruction. M.F.j   Earlier I had  asked  you for your evaluation of the Women's dub movement in Chapel Kill,  and  we had  gotten sidetracked. Berryhill:   Consid erably. M.F.:  [Laughter]    I was wondering if we could  pull back and close with that. Berryhill: What would, you like to ask? M.F.j Do you think that the nature of the work done by these clubs, Berryhill 44 the nature of the clubs themselves,  what is it like now,  what was it like then?    What about the women who joined  the clubs? Berryhilli I believe that as time goes on,  there will be a lessening of interest in the women's groups,  because,  as I explained   earlier, young women are too involved  in other things.    And without household assistance,   even though they are all much better organized   than my generation,  there isn't going to be time in their busy lives,or they don't feel the need  for it.    I find   this particularly true in the medical group of women,   that they are so involved  in their own lives and  their own ambitions,  that they don't have this interest that our generation had.    And  as much as I regret this philosophy,  one young woman told me,  "Medicine is my husband's career and  interest,  and I have my own." M.F.i  Thank you.
