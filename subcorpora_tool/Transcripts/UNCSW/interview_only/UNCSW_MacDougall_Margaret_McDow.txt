Mary Frederickson:  I wanted to begin by asking you about your family background, about your parents and about your grandparents.  You were born in what was then Yorkville, South Carolina, which was a town of three thousand, on October 22, 1903.  I wanted to ask you what you remembered about your grandparents. Did you know them, or did you just hear stories about what they had done? Margaret MacDougall:  I only knew one of my grandparents, which was my maternal grandmother, Margaret Susan Simons Clarkson, for whom I was named.  And she died when I was just a child, say around six years old. She was evidently a very strong person.  She attempted to teach me modesty by showing me how to dress, and she dressed dolls for me.  But she wanted to dress them her way, and I wanted her to dress them my way. I wanted them with long baby clothes, and she wanted them dressed like little girls.  Outside of that I just don't remember too much about her. I can remember when she died. My mother and my aunts came back to where I was staying in Charlotte and had on long black veils. Now I have heardand now I know from these recordsa great many things that she did, so I couldn't help but admire her. She escaped with her children on a train fleeing from Sherman's army. And the bridges were cut, and she had to get off the train with these children.  And on the roadside my uncle, who was afterwards Justice Heriot Clarkson, was born. M.F.: Did she ever tell you stories about that, or did you find it all out later? MacDougall: No, I was really too young.  I found all this out later.  It's corroborated in these scrapbooks that I have read about her. M.F.: Did she ever talk about the Civil War at all that you remember? 2 MacDougall:  She didn't to me that I remember, but my mother had told me all these things.  [Interruption] After the War when she had nothing, she went to the school principal near Columbia to ask for a job to teach school so she could make a living for her children 'til Grandpa got started in something, because he was only trained to run a plantation.  And when she went to apply, the principal was one of her former slaves, and he gave her the job to teach near Columbia. And then my Cousin Julia founded a school for Negroes after the War and worked in it all her life.  That was near Columbia.  I also heard my mother say that she never had a handkerchief that wasn't made out of one of 'pa's old shirttails, which means that Grandmother used everything she could because they were so poor.  And then she made their little pants out of flour sacks.  And Mother was very much embarrassed because they thought, when the flour sacks were washed, that the name of the kind of flour it was would come off, but it didn't, and that was the kind of pants she wore. Then my Aunt Marion Clarkson (who married Robert Moore, who became head of a cotton mill many years later) long before she knew him went to see one of the neighbors in Charlotte when whe was just a child. And it seemed that they were from the North, and she said, "You don't look like the kind of people that would steal silver." And they said, "What do you mean?" And she said, "Well, all Yankees steal silver, don't they?" from what stories she'd heard, of course. Then in Charlotte, Grandma was a member of St. Peter's Episcopal Church and on the Board of Managers of St. Peter's Episcopal Hospital and was one of the founders of the only hospital in Charlotte for Negroes, and it was called the Good Samaritan Hospital. 3 M.F.: How did they later get back on their feet, after the Civil War? MacDougall:  I never have known how they got a nice house, but they did have a nice house in Charlotte, which someone had evidently given them.  I can remember, barely, the insides of it, where it had a beautiful marble mantel and whatnot. And Grandma sewed for blacks and for whites at night and made all her children's clothes.  And there was a Negro university at Charlotte, and she gave a Negro man his board if he would work and plant her garden.  So that's what they lived off. And then Grandpa had got a job as railroad conductor out of Charlotte, so that's how they got along. M.F.: What about the other side of the family? MacDougall: On my father's side of the family, Grandfather was a doctor, and he did not go through the War.  And I think it must have been because he stayed home to treat the people while others went to the War. That has always been my impression. During the Reconstruction, I have heard many a time that he rode all day trying to collect money, and there just wasn't any money. And he'd go around on horseback collecting money, so it shows how poor he was after the War.  And he had married Isabella Cunningham, who allegedly was the wealthiest woman in South Carolina,* and of course they were left penniless. Her homeI guess it was in Camdenwas also burned to the ashes by Sherman's army.  And that's in a book that is not in my possession; my children have it. My father, in telling about the Civil War, always tried to seek the truth. And I can remember one thing he said that legally, according *See Appendix I: 1725  Arthur Cunningham  1828 ^Kirkland and Kennedy, Historic Camden, p. 313. 4 to the Constitution, we had a right to secede, but that he did not see how anybody could ever think that slavery was rightthat it was wrongand that he felt Sherman had a right to burn Columbia, but what he thought was wrong, he said he should have said, "Yes, I burned it, and I burned it as an act of war." But he blamed it on stragglers and wouldn't take the blame for burning Columbia. My great grandfather's house^now this is on Mother's side, in Columbiahad thirty-nine columns, and Sherman was going to take it as his headquarters. And someone said to him, "That man has eight sons in the Confederate Army,"* and Sherman said, "Burn it to the ground," which it of course was.** M.F.:  Did they lose all of their land as well? MacDougall: Yes, they lost everything they had.  There seemed to have been some land outside of Columbia where Mother was born so they couldn't have lost it allin Eastover, South Carolina, which was near Columbia.  So until they went to Charlotte....  I know that's where Mother was born. But so far as the plantation, I think Ijohn Lord, Beacon Lights of History, vol. VIII, pp. 235-236. He spent three weeks with Mr. Clarkson in Columbia, South Carolina, met at the railroad station by "coach &amp; six," two horses, two colored servants and two dogs. Welcomed at stately mansion by Mr. Clarkson, his wife and six daughters. He describes Mr. Clarkson's kind treatment of his slaves, religious services on Sunday.by a brilliant young clergyman. *See Appendix II **See Appendix III &amp;lt;I those plantations were near Charleston and Columbia.*1 M.F.: What kind of situation did your mother live in when she was a small girl? MacDougall: I never heard her talk about it except about her mother making her clothes. M.F.: And then they moved to Charlotte, so she really grew up in Charlotte. What about your father? He was born in Kershaw County? MacDougall:  Yes, in Kershaw County, near Lancaster.2 And his father was a doctor and continued to practice as a doctor.** And he took my father as he rode about on horseback to treat his patients; he took my father with him when Dad was like three or five years old. And talked to him and began to teach him about poetry and literature on these long rides.  And Grandfather invented, supposedly, a method for treating typhoid fever, putting patients in cold water to get the fever down. He had a country patient and the roof leaked, and the girl was about to die and would have died had not the roof leaked. And then he figured that that was why she was still living, that that cold water brought her temperature down.  Bernard Baruch's father had a child with typhoid fever, and he was in Camden. Many northerners came to Camden. He was a great friend of my grandfather's, and I think he'd the one who asked Grandfather to talk before the Baltimore Medical Society on this treatment of typhoid fever, because Grandfather treated his daughter. And we now have a silver pitcher that was given to him by a Dr. Miles of Baltimore. Now you'll find about him in medical history; I came across his name in a book about one of the Mayos. *See Appendix IV **See Appendix V ^Thomas Grange Simons, III  his forebears and relations 2T,iberty Hill. Smith f.irnllna_____________________________ 6 M.F.: What do you think the overall effect of the War was on your family? What came down to you, that they had been hurt, that they were bitter, that they were . . . MacDougall: No. M.F.:  . . . trying to cope with what had happened to them? MacDougall:  They were trying to cope with what had happened to them. By the time I was born, of course Dad had a job. He wasn't making much, but he had a job.  And they weren't bitter, but my mother did not think that South Carolina should have ever seceded. But, like Robert E. Lee, when it did secede, they were willing to fight to defend their own country. But Sherman had begged his brother in Congress, John Sherman, not to start a war, because he had been in the South; he knew the South. And he felt that hotheads were going to start a war and that it would be a great mistake.  But now on the other hand, one of my great uncles signed the Ordinance of Secession. M.F.:  So your family seemed to be split as to how they felt about it. MacDougall:  Yes, but most of them felt it could have been worked out some other way. Because we were living in a slave economy, and just to abolish it and free those slaves all at once....  Well, it's like any emerging nation or peoples; they can't really cope with it all at once. [Interruption]  There was a great uncle in Charleston who was extremely religious, and he did not think that you should cook on Sunday or work your horses on Sunday, so he actually walked to church for miles and miles every Sunday. And then he wanted to free his slaves, and he was not permitted to free those slaves because he didn't think slavery was right. And there is a case about it in South Carolina, if you could look back in the law books.* *See Appendix VI I, Lt&amp;gt;a il V    rl .      i        .'!. ii. ,  11    &amp;lt;' i fO I  ! " '' 7 M.F.: Do you remember his name? MacDougall:  I could look it up in one of these books.  I'll look up his name, because I have all these....  I got these last May from my cousin, brought them over here, family histories and whatnot. M.F.: What about your father? What kind of education was he given? MacDougall: He went to the Bingham Military School in Asheville, North Carolina.  And Major Bingham, the President, had a wonderful effect on my father. My father was devoted to him, and he was to Dad, and Mrs. Bingham was so good to all the boys that she influenced him.  And when Colonel Bingham, I guess they called him, was eighty-five years old, he asked just a few of his old students back to stay in the barracks and live just as they'd lived when they were there as boys, and Dad was one of them.* Everybody thought that'Mrs. Bingham spent entirely too much time with those boys, but later on one of them, Bob Bingham, his son, was accused of killing his wife. Now this is in North Carolina. I think she was Flagler's widow.  You know who he is, owned the railroad. And so Dad knew that he could not have.  So he got various newspaper editors to write editorials saying that Robert Bingham could not ever have done such a thing.  So then Bob Bingham said that it was bread cast upon the waters, what his mother had done for those boys; then one of them could come to his rescue.  So then he was appointed afterwards to the Court of St. James.** I think it must have been under Roosevelt. And he asked us many times to come to Louisville to visit him, but we *See Appendix VII:  Col. Bingham's Reunion **See Appendix VII: Telegram from Ambassador Bingham '-John Clarkson 8 just didn't have the money, and Dad wouldn't have accepted; he was proud. So I never met him.  I did talk to his son, Barry Bingham during the Stevenson campaign; we were both working for Stevenson. M.F.:  So your father graduated from high school there. MacDougall:  Yes.  But then he went to the University of South Carolina.* I do not know how long he stayed. And he was not kicked out, but the President wrote a letter to his father saying, "Your son is wasting his brilliant wayward mind, and I would advise you to take him out of college and make him go in a law office and study law," which he did. M.F.: Who did he study law under? MacDougall:  He studied law under a lawyer named Mr. M.J. Hough in Lancaster, and he went into his office. And then later with W. Blackburn Wilson in York County; I think it was in Rock Hill. M.F.: Where was his family home at this time? MacDougall: Rock Hill, South Carolina. M.F.:  So he went on and practiced law. MacDougall: Yes. M.F.: Did he set up his own law practice? MacDougall: Yes. He set up his own practice in York, South Carolina, because at that time it was the county seat where the courthouse was. And it was fifteen miles from Rock Hill. The roads were muddy, and at that time York was bigger than Charlotte. Unbelievable. M.F.:  [laughter] MacDougall:  Many a time I have driven my father in my pony buggy *See Appendix V: Wallace, History of South Carolina 9 over to Rock Hill and hitched my pony in the middle of the street and went and ate ice cream and whatnot while he went to practice law. And he really should have moved there then, because he said he never walked down the street in Rock Hill that he didn't get some cases. But it was on account of the courthouse that he lived....  Later, when my brother practiced law with him, he opened a Rock Hill office which my brother ran.  Then, after my brother died in 1958, there wasn't anyone and then later on, two of his grandchildren came to Rock Hill to practice law.1 M.F.: What did you think of your dad's occupation when you were little? Did you go often with him and learn about law? MacDougall:  No, I went with him when he made speeches.  At Confederate Memorial Days I can remember going with him.  And whenever he made a speech, I'd go with him.  I went to political meetings with J him in South Carolina. The candidates had to speak from the same platform. 1 And I can remember going to this little town called Filbert.  It ,                                   probably had two hundred people in it.  And you had a picnic.  And one politician got up and just took off after our congressman, Mr. Finley who was a neighbor of ours.  And just as a child, I just got absolutely |                                   furious with him, with the people who were attacking my friend, Mr. Finley. But Mr. Finley chewed tobaccoI can see him on out front porch i                                   right nowhe'd chew tobacco and spit off the side of the porch. And in Washington, once Dad went up there, and Mr. Finley was about to go downstairs in his bedroom slippers and looking like I don't know what. And he said, "Am I okay?" and Dad said, "Indeed you're not.  I'm not Thomas F. McDow, 1968 W. Clarkson McDow, Jr., 1972 10 going downstairs with anyone who looks like that." But I never heard himiin the courthouse, which is very strange because people would come from miles around to hear him talk and speak. Why I didn't go, I don't know. Yes, I did; I went to one case.  I heard him once where he was defending a bank president, when all the banks had gone broke during the Depression. But that was the only time I ever went and listened to him. M.F.:  Was he real active in politics himself? MacDougall: Yes. He started out and ran for the Mayor of Yorkville, South Carolina, and was elected. Then he was elected to the legislature, and he did a lot for education in South Carolina in the legislature. For instance, he got a dormitory for Winthrop College in Rock Hill. M.F.: How many terms did he serve in the legislature? MacDougall:  I don't know.  I know he was a member of the Ways and Means Committee, because I have the pictures of him. M.F.: But he did serve several terms in the Congress. MacDougall: He never ran for Congress.  I don't think he served very many in the legislature; it was one or two.  Because I'm sure that when my brother served many years later, he got out because he couldn't afford to leave his law practice that long. Then Dad ran for the Senate and was defeated by an ignorant carpenter by four votes, which has always made me conscious of the fact of how much one vote counts. Then later on in life, while I was at Agnes Scott, one of the ex-governors was sent to see him and asked him to run for governor. And this ex-governor said, "Now I'm asking you because I've been told to, but as a friend I would advise you not to do it because you get very little money.  It's taken me several years to pay off the debts I incurred while I was 11 Governor of South Carolina." Which is quite a different story from what happens now. M.F.:  [laughter] Yes. Just the opposite. MacDougall: Just the opposite. M.F.: Who was the ex-governor who wanted him to run? MacDougall:  It seems to me it was Duncan C. Heyward. M.F.: What do you think was the greatest influence your father had on you? MacDougall:  I think the love of learning. And he had a great influence on my being for the underdog, because he felt that they couldn't take up for themselves. And the last words he ever said to us before he died were, "Look after the Negroes and the poor. The rich will take care of themselves." M.F.:  Did his law practice reflect that? Did he take a lot of poor clients? MacDougall:  Oh, yes, he really did. He took lots of people who actually couldn't pay him. He did a lot of free legal work. And then again, in South Carolina the courts appointed lawyers to defend cases where people were indigent. And you had to defend these people, and you didn't get a cent for it.  For instance, he had to defend a man who committed rape on an eighty-four-year-old woman. Just some terrible cases. But then one judge appointed my brother and another young lawyer to defend an indigent client. BEGIN SIDE II TAPE I MacDougall:  ...The defendant said, "Judge, excuse me, instead of 12 both of them two young lawyers, will you just give me one, either Mr, Blackburn Wilson or Mr. Tom McDow?" And the judge said, "Well, there's one sure thing: no one can plead you're insane." M.F.:  [laughter] What do you think that he wanted you to do or wanted your brother to do? MacDougall:  I'm sure he always wanted me to be a lawyer and practice with him in his office.  I know it. He really wanted me to practice. But then, after I was already engaged, while I was in my last year at Agnes Scott, he said, "I'm not going to spend that money on you." Because I was going to get married, and I certainly wasn't going to be there to practice law. But he would have liked it very much. M.F.: What about your brother? Did he want your brother to do the same thing? MacDougall:  Yes, but basically he was almost discouraged to do it, because he did not feel that he wanted to push us into anything we didn't really want to do.  That if Bill, my brother, wanted to be a doctor, he would have helped him be a doctor. But he did want us to get an education and have some kind of profession, some way to make a living, too. M.F.: Who were his closest friends? MacDougall: There were a great many cultured people in York, such as Dr. Neville, Presbyterian Minister, later first president of Presbyterian College; the Witherspoons; the Wilsons; the McCaws; the Wardlaws; the Brattons.  South Carolina being a small state, people had friends all over the state. Two of Dad's favorites were Justice W.W. Watts of Laurens and Mr. W.W. Ball, Editor of "The Columbia State" 13 and "The Charleston News and Courier," who wrote The State that Forgot. As Ralph McGill said, he was conservative, but he was certainly conservative all over. My father was not. He was a liberal; at least, I thought that he was ahead of his time. But every now and then he'd :                                                                                  ... associate with some of these reactionary people, and he would then take on their coloration.  So mostly lawyers, doctors, and then there were (                                                                                                                                                                                                                             - .                                     just some of the people in the neighborhood like a Mr. Allison, who sold mules and horses and whatnot, ran what they called a livery stable. M.F.: How did he balance his work in politics with his work as.... Didn't he serve sometimes as a judge? .                                                MacDougall: Yes. There were two factions in South Carolina, the Tillman and anti-Tillman; then there was the Blease and anti-Blease. 1 They were for the downtrodden, or at least they got elected by pretending to be.  But they were demagogues, and in South Carolina people felt so i strongly about politics that they wouldn't speak to each other.  For in- |                                     stance, a Bleasite sometimes (as we called them) wouldnft speak to a \                                     person on the other side. And so far as Blease himself was concerned, he was just pure poison. And my father and one of his best friends, who afterwards became governor, Governor John Richards, they grew up together. {                                     And Richards did not believe in Blease, but he went over to his side simply to get elected.  And Dad just told him he wasn't going to vote i                                      for him [laughter] for that very reason. But Blease asked Dad to be a circuit judge. Blease said that he was the only damn man in South t                                      Carolina who had sense enough to be. But on the other hand, we always I                                      felt that he wanted to get Dad out of his political way. Then he Hf.W. Ball, The State that Forgot, (The Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1932) 14 couldn't work against him, if he was the judge. ! M.F.: Did he accept the judgeship?   _    v I                                                MacDougall: No, he couldn't accept it, because it only paid two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and he had two children to support and he couldn't have possibly done that on two hundred and fifty dollars I |                                      a month. Now every lawyer, almost, wants to be a judge.  So then he i                                     was appointed, numerous times, to sit on cases as a judge, and once on the Supreme Court as Chief Justice where the judge had to disqualify i                                      himself.* And I remember one story he told about sitting as a judge, and this old Negro man, Dad had to sentence him to death.  And he said it .                                     was the worst experience he had ever had, that he could never believe what a terrible feeling it gave him to sentence someone to death.  So i                                      before he sentenced him, he said, "I'm going to give you one more chance. What ever brought you to the point of killing your wife?" And the man I                                      said, "Well, I'll tell you, Jedge, she vexed me." i                                                M.F.: But he went ahead and was... 5 f                                                MacDougall: But he went ahead; there wasn't enything else to do. But imagine killing someone because they made you mad. M.F.: What was your mother like? What was her education? I                                                 MacDougall:  She wanted to go to Wellesley.  But there again, ,                                      didn't have the money. 5                                                 M.F.: Why did she want to go to Wellesley? i                                                 MacDougall:  She just wanted to go to a really top-notch woman's r                                       school, and she liked to study and she could have gotten in. But instead I                                      she had to go to what was then the Charlotte Female Institute, but *See Appendix VIII:  "The Columbia State'," 1934. 15 it's now Queens College. And she was graduated second in her class. Then she got a job to teach in,Rock Hill, South Carolina.  [Interruption] When she was sixteen years old she finished at Queens. M.F.: Sixteen years old? MacDougall:  Sixteen years old, and so it must hot have been too much education.  But she got this job to teach the first grade in what they called the graded school. There was only one school there, and it went from the first grade through the tenth at that time, I think. Interestingly enough to me is that about three weeks ago her grandson, my nephew, teaches math in this same school.  This is his second year, and the students and faculty dedicated the annual to him. And also there was a writeup about the fact that his grandmother was on the first faculty of that school, that he was following in her footsteps. M.F.: How long did she teach? MacDougall: I can't remember. She married in 1893. She went back then to Charlotte from Rock Hill and taught. She taught under Mr. Alexander Graham. M.F.: How did she and your father meet each other? MacDougall:  A man in Rock Hill, a Mr. Joe Roddey, told Dad that he wanted to introduce him to a beautiful girl, and Dad said he knew plenty of beautiful girls. But the minute he met her, he really had his head set he was going to marry her.  So she kept telling him no, no, no. Well, an old maid who had had many beaux in Yorkville, South "Sfhen Mother told Dr. Graham that she was resigning at Christmas to be married, he strummed his fingers on the chair and said, "When I got married, I was in $50.00 debt.  I have been $50.00 in debt ever since." 16 Carolina. She gave Dad a rabbit foot for good luck and told him to put it in his pocket the next time he proposed to "Misa Mary." And Dad did, and sure enough she said yes. A nurse who nursed in our house many years laterMother had migrainsaid that it was the happiest family she'd ever nursed in.  But Dad as a young man, he had been so...what would I say..."wild".... He would drink liquor and go with girls, I mean a thousand of them, and break engagements with them.  In fact, a couple of his schoolmates, after his death, had dinner with Bob and me one night.  And one of them was a historian, and the other was an architect. And they were telling about their days at the University of South Carolina, and when they finished, Bob said, "I thought I went to Georgia Tech, but I think it must have been Lucy Cobb." M.F.:  [laughter] MacDougall:  They sold chickens, they just did everything.  They were just plain devilish. M.F.: What kinds of things did your mother get involved in after she was married? MacDougall:  She really wanted children.  Well, she had one child who lived about an hour. The doctor absolutely butchered Mother. So Dad sent her to JohnsHopkins, and she was there for weeks.  I have their letters when she was up there. And one ovary was taken out, and she never thought she could have any more children. But ten years after they'd been married, my brother, Thomas F., was born, and then two years later I was born. Two years later my brother Clarkson whom I call Bill, was born, so she had three children after that. But in the meantime, in those ten years, Mother wanted to teach school because she 17 loved it.  She loved children.  She didn't want to spend her whole time doing the things that a lot of women do, although she was do- i l                                     mestic. But Dad wouldn't let her, and she took it.  I mean, if he didn't want her to...I think he felt it would have been a reflection i                                     on him for his wife to have to work. Well, it would have gotten him j                                     out of debt, because Mother said if she'd known how much in debt he | |                                     was in when she married him, she never would have married him. [laughter] M.F.:  So when her children started coming again, then she... MacDougall: Well, first I ought to say I think she (this is her daughter, prejudiced, speaking)  was one of the most exquisite women i i                                      I've ever known.  Not only just physically beautiful, but spiritually j j                                     beautiful as well; inside and out, she was just a beautiful person. t                                     And she was a great Bible student, as Episcopalian, and didn't even join the Presbyterian Church for fourteen or fifteen years after she i                                     married. And the only reason she joined was....  She went, though, be- j                                     cause she wanted my father to go, which he did.  I can remember the very i pew we sat on. And for instance, we had family prayers. And oncethis was when I was grown; I wasn't even at homeSenator Clyde Hoey from |                                     North Carolina was defending a case with Dad.  The man who allegedly ?                                     killed his wife was from Shelby, where Clyde Hoey was from, so that's j                                     why Dad associated Clyde Hoey in the case.  He stayed at our house. I                                      Everybody stayed at your house, because the hotel wasn't any good, and |                                      anyway, Mother was just the hospitable kind.  So they were having family prayers.  Everybody was on their knees.  And Mother prayed that justice would be done.  So when they got up off their knees, Dad said, "Mary, you have ruined our case. We don't want justice; we want mercy." i I                                                M.F.:  [laughter] 18 MacDougall: You had asked me about his interests. He loved the law, but I think his family absolutely came first. Mother and his children. He taught us all to swim. He bought tts a bill goat and would help usI can see him nowshowed us how to hitch up the little billy goat. He bought us a pony. He took us out on bicycles and took us out in an old swimming hole and taught us how to swim.  In other words, he just really did things for us, beside talking to us. He loved trial law, but where he really made his money was in civil law.  People always felt, "Well, he must be rich," but he wasn't rich.  There wasn't a rich lawyer in South Carolina except two.  One of them was this Haynesworth's fatherhe was the corporation lawyerand there was one more rich man.  He wasn't a lawyer.  But they said that all lawyers lived well and died poor, and it was true. Because he certainly was not rich, but I felt that I had had the advantages of neither poverty nor wealth, which I think is good. M.F.: What about your mother's activities? Was she ever involved in the suffrage movement? MacDougall: No, never. M.F.: Was she opposed to women's suffrage? MacDougall: No, she wasn't opposed to it.  She was just the kind of person who....  She loved history, and she belonged to the DAR. That's anathema to me. But she loved to write papers. She was studious. M.F.: Did she ever belong to the women's clubs or study clubs? MacDougall: Yes, she founded what was the only literary club Mother was anything but a reformer. I took after Dad in that respect. 19 in York, which was called the Asbury Coward Literary Society. Asbury Coward was a Confederate veteran who ran a school in Yorkville. Yorkville was a cultural and educational center at one time, and Colonel Coward ran this. And this was named for Colonel Coward.  She was interested, and she wanted us to read.  I can remember her reading me David Copperfield before I could read. And I can remember sprawling out on the floor in the hall reading Great Expectations.  And she was ambitious.  Now socially, she belonged, so to speak. As I said to my brother one time, "You know, Mother really was a Christian." But what I cannot understand is how she could have all that class prejudice.  It was a question of noblesse oblige.  She didn't think anyone ought to "go out" unless they went via the St.  Cecelia.  And my sister-in-law from the West said, "Go out where?" I said, "That's a good question." And it was.  And I think that Mother expected me.... Now she certainly expected us to study, because the first thing we had to do after school was to study our lessons. We could play, but she saw that we studied. She wanted us to get good marks, which I thought was bad in a way, because it didn't really matter.  I got good marks; my brothers weren't as good, because he didn't study as hard. M.F.: Was she really big on your being a southern lady and your growing up to be proper and prim? MacDougall: Yes, indeed.  She was never prim, but she was a lady from the top of her head to the tip of her toes.  She was just She belonged to a Woman's Bible Class which met once a week. She was a true Southern Belle. 20 my size, except she was really, really beautiful. Had golden blond hair and curly, and blue eyes. Thomas F. had her eyes. And she told me when I married, "Well, one thing, you'll know how to entertain your husband's friends." And I thought the other day, when I was sticking ! i                                     all that stuff [laughter] on the table with all this dirty silver and ;                                     sticking things aside, "I wonder what Mother would think." She loved j J                                     young people, and all over South Carolina when she died, these young j people came to her funeral. And they stopped by our house just any I                                     time whether we were there or not, even if my brother wasn't there or I I wasn't there.  The young people would stop by and spend the night, I and they would go in the refrigerator and get dinner or anything they j                                      wanted to. And we had to go to church.  She was religious and she j                                     really knew her Bible. But then she believed in having a good time, f                                     too.  See, she was an Episcopalian. M.F.:  [laughter] I                                                MacDougall: And if it was Wednesday night, we all had to go to prayer meeting first, sit on the front row.  But then we could go home and have a dance. And some of the people didn't believe in dancing, Presbyterians.  And so Mother said they sat out in the car and did what they called "petting." So she thought it was a lot better for them to be in her house dancing. j M.F.: The Presbyterian children couldn't dance, right? I !                                                MacDougall: Many of them couldn't dance or play cards, which j                                      Mother thought was just plain crazy. All her sisters played bridge and she didn't, but she sewed.  She sewed exquisitely, and in those 1                                      times if you had pretty clothes, you had to make them. Someone had to make your pretty clothes, or else you didn't have pretty clothes. 21 And it made a great difference.  Some of the clothes Mother made me were just absolutely exquisite, hand lace that deep sewed together and all this gorgeous embroidery. Even little ribbons running through my pants.  I've never seen her, as much as she was sick with those migraine headaches....  She wasn't in bed; she was dressed for breakfast and every other time. And she saw that we were. We could play in the mornings, we could get as dirty as we wanted, but that afternoon we dressed. We'd put on fresh clothes. The next morning we wore the same underwear, but then we'd change it that afternoon. And Mother liked to live in the big house with the white columns.  She was just that type.  And felt that neither my brother nor I had ambition, because I even had the architect draw my plans again so that the house would look more unpretentiousmy house in Atlanta.  She loved flowers both of them didand I can see her now with a basket about this big, and she'd pick roses every morning, and took them down the street. Took them to somebody, a visitor, a friend, or somebody that was sick. And then she'd make rolls, and she'd take them to people, or homemade light bread.  She was always giving things to people. M.F.: Did she have servants working in her house? MacDougall: Yes, always. M.F.: Several? MacDougall:  No, we usually had just one, unless Mother was sick. And we always had a nurse. And I can remember one nurse called Sadie, and I used to say to Mother, "Mother, Sadie's just as good as I am, isn't she?" And Mother would never answer.  Because at three years old I believed that, and Sadie must have felt it.  But she was kind to blacks, but it was complete maternalism.  She had one cook, 22 and her name was Janie. And when Mother was sick she helped out. Dad's chauffeur and houseboy and everything else was named John. He was about twenty-two years old. And he cooked, he drove; he did everything else for Mother and Dad. But then if Mother was sick, he had to get someone extra in, and John really resented it.  And he said one day, "Janie accuses me of stealing. Everybody knows I don't steal nothing except liquor." People used to call him Johnny McDow. He felt that he really sort of halfway owned the family. M.F.:  How old was he when he first came to work for your Dad? MacDougall: He was about twenty or twenty-two years old. M.F.: And did he work there his whole life? MacDougall: He worked there until Dad died, and Mother tried to live in that house but it was a big house and a big yard, and literally, after Dad's death, she just could not live there alone. So John, first I think he got a job with the Belk's in Charlotte. Mother had trained him. He was really a finished servant. And then later on he came back to York and worked for some people who owned the ten-cent store. And he came down here when we first built our house. Arid I can remember meeting Bob.  I met him at the bus line. We had one car. And John was on the same bus; I was going to meet him. I said, "John, how do you like the people you work for?" He says, "Well, I'll tell you what, Miss Margaret.  They's all right, but they ain't got no influence. I likes to work for people that got influence." Then he says, "Now you take Mrs. Sadie."  (That was his boss's wife.) "She's right down in town. She's scared to get out of that hotel by herself." So for supper, I told John to go out in the freezer and get some deer chops so I could defrost them and we could have them for dinner. So he said, "Now just wait 'til I get back down there and tells 23 Mrs. Sadie I've been eating deer meat.  She ain't never heard of deer meat." Of course, John never had either until then, I don't think. M.F.: Was your family regarded as unusual in York, with your father taking as clients poor people and blacks, or was it all sort of expected? Did they do anything that made people raise their eyebrows? MacDougall: Not but once. When the bank failed, it was the law that if you are a stockholder in a bank and the bank failed, you had to pay double the amount of your stock.  And Dad represented the young president of the bank, who had not taken anything.  Certainly he had made loans that turned out to be foolish. The Depression came. But the directors tried to blame it entirely on him.  His name was Mac Ferguson. And when Dad defended Mac Ferguson, person after person, I walked down the street, and they wouldn't even speak.  And that's when I made up my mind that never would I come to the point where I wouldn't speak to anyone. They got over it, but one of the few people that did speak was Ross Cannon. He was allegedly running the mill for his father. BEGIN SIDE I TAPE II MacDougall: Yes, there was a Cannon mill in York. M.F.: And were the Cannons from York? MacDougall: No, they were from Concord, North Carolina. And I can remember old Mr. Cannon and his wife, just met them, and what they looked like. And Ross Cannon married a beautiful girl named Ashton 24 Lowe. Mother had known her. And one of the children's deaths that effected me greatly was, they had a little girl named Laura McGill. I loved children, and it just killed me when she died.  I used to be a free babysitter for everybody, because I just loved them. M.F.:  I wanted to ask you about the industry in York and if you remembered the mills. MacDougall:  I remember the mill. There was only one mill.  And I can remember the whistles for them go to work before day in the morning. M.F.: Do you remember your parents ever saying anything about the mill? MacDougall:  Oh, yes. When it was the Cannon Mills , Dad represented the mills.  I mean he was on a retainer.  I think I told you about remembering being in Dad's study playing or sitting, and one of those cotton mill people was talking to him.  They were called "lint-heads." And Dad was doing some legal work for him or defending him. And he had great sympathy for the mill people, where every member of the family had to work just to scratch out a bare, bare living. And also, the mill people were completely segregated.  Although there was a mill school, some of the children went to our school, and I was glad that I had that experience, too, of going to school with some of the mill people.  There again, I had some friends who were mill people, and Mother would never explain to me why she wouldn't let me invite them to my birthday parties, because they were my friends. M.F.: What about your Dad in the law office? Did he sympathize with the workers over the owners? MacDougall: Whoever he represented, he'd get completely biased. They could do no harm; they hadn't done it; they were right. But he There were at least two:  the Cannon Mill and one owned by Mr. Walter Moore. 25 defended both sides. What he was noted for was being a trial lawyer, but that is not actually where the money was.  It was in civil law. For instance, the Duke Power Company was coming through North and South Carolina buying up this land for nothing. And he won a lot of cases against them, so many, in fact, that they tried to put him on a retainer for them, but he didn't want to do it. But in his latter life he wanted to be a district attorney for the Seaboard, because as he got older he wanted some type of steady income where there would always be something coming in.  And it was during the Depression. He was always for social reform; he was for prison reform, for instance.  He saw that there was a new jail built. And I think when he was President of the Bar Association, you had to give a talk, and his talk was on prison reform and actually against the chain gang system.  You know what that is, balls and chains. We've come a long way from all that.  And then he was interested in education. He was chairman of the school board, which was pretty hard on me.  Because the only time he ever got mad at me that I can remember in my whole life, there was a schoolteacher named Mrs. Jones.  She was a widow. And we took advantage of her and began cutting up in school; we wouldn't listen, we wouldn't pay attention. And so Dad did really read me the riot act.  So I began being so perfect that everybody called me "Teacher's Pet." She was so grateful. There I was in trouble again. M.F.: What about the importance of religion in your family? You said you went to church and had family prayers. Were both of your parents terribly religious? MacDougall: Dad started outor rather, he said he didas 26 an agnostic. But he wanted to find out for himself, and he actually studied the Bible. And he read everything under the sun. He read Kant. He read arguments pro and con, religion, Voltaire, Schopenhauer. I considered him deeply religious, but not pious in any sense of the word. He thought you ought to put your religion into practice.  But Mother, I think, too, had a great influence on him, on what he believed. For instance, he said, "If you really believed that everybody who was not a member of the church or did not believe in Jesus Christ was going to some kind of hell, you'd crawl on your hands and knees over glass to get to him.  So you know we don't believe that. How could you possible believe it?" That that was the only way to get to Heaven. M.F.: You said that your older brother died when you were about seven years old, and I wondered about the effect of that death on your family. MacDougall:  It had a terrible effect on the whole family.  I was staying with some friends while he was ill. He was ill just about once a week, with some kind of kidney trouble. At least that's what it was diagnosed as; I guess no one ever really knew.  I came home after the funeral, and here was his little bed where he slept, and he wasn't in it. Well, that absolutely killed me.  I haven't gotten over it 'til now; I mean, it's affected my thinking all of my life. He was adorable to me. He was everything you'd ever wish Both Mother and Dad taught Bible classes. Their religion was one of joy and affirmation. They had a sense of commitment and passed it on. .' 27 for. Dad had taught him to study and read, at seven years old. Just everything. And he called me Snow White, because my hair was solid white. And once I remember Dad had a watch. Men carried big old watches like this, and Dad had Thomas F.'s golden curl in his watch, and I chopped all my hair, this little white stuff, and stuck it in the back of his watch because I was so jealous. But we were going to Sunday school, and a man in front of the hotel was saying, "Anybody want a shoeshine? Anybody was a shoeshine?" So I went up and said, "Yes, I do." And Thomas F. came home and told Mother, "Snow White just embarrasses me to death." And he told her about that. And then another time he said, "You know, Mother, Snow White will kiss anybody.  She even kissed the circus woman." But we played together.  I can remember making toad frog houses out of sand. Just playing together. My brother, though, it affected him in a worse way than it did me, because Dad couldn't stand to talk about it. Mother wanted to talk about it. Well, that created something bad right there. And Dad would not read to Bill like he read to Thomas F., because it made him too sad.  So Bill grew up without all this reading, without his father reading to him.  He didn't really begin to love to read until he got into college. He didn't really love to study until he got in law school; he just got in something he liked and excelled in that. But Mother went into a depression. And at the time I didn't know what a depression was; I didn't know anything about it. But I'm sure she was in a depression. M.F.: What about her migraine headaches? Did those start after that? MacDougall: She had them all her life, ever since I can remember. 28 And they did not stop. Now mine stopped, but hersdidn't.  I didn't have any 'til I was about thirty-five years old, when I began having a lot of responsibility after my father died, and somebody had to pick up the pieces; it turned out to be me. But I can remember many times going to the wall and putting my head against the wall and weeping my soul out, thinking my mother was going to die. Because they're so horrible; you get so sick. And I can hear her now with them. She never complained, but she never really got over them. And I finally went to a psychiatrist in New York.  I didn't know he was a psychiatrist; I just knew he was good at migraine.  Cornell Medical School.  And after he talked to me an hour one afternoon and then gave me his report in another hour, that was all I needed, was to understand it. And he said, "You need,never go in a doctor's office.  There's not a doctor on earth can help you.  Eighty percent of the people who have migraine are perfectionists, and you just fall into that category." Every time he asked me a question I fell in a trap.  I mean, he'd say, "What would you rather do than anything else?" and I'd say, "Read." "What do you like to read?" Well, I'd tell him and then he'd say, "All serious." And then, "Your husband's so nice and brings you your coffee every morning before you get up. How about helping you with the dishes?" And I said, "Oh, he'd love to help me, but he wouldn't get them clean; there'd be grease on them." He said, "But you rinse each one, don't you?" And I said, "Yes, I rinse each one." Well, it just went on like that. And so I outgrew them because he told me how.  It really took plain guts.  If I went out and mowed the yard when the yard man wasn't there in August in the hot sun because I couldn't stand to see that grass and I got a headache, then he said, 29 "You think what's causing it, and then don't do that anymore." And so you gradually eliminate all these things. And you have to not only do it, but you've got to get to the point where you don't 'I care. And you can see how now I don't care.  I don't even mind this dust sitting around.  Saturday I'll get somebody to come and clean it up. But I gradually just got over it. M.F.: But your mother never did. MacDougall:  She never got over it. M.F.: Was her house always just perfect? MacDougall: Always perfect. And we always had to have a chore, and my chore was fixing flowers all over the house, every day.  So here, of course, I can't do that.  I'd like to.  But I did in my own house. There was never a day without flowers in that house, because I just grew up that way and I loved it. And she was so neat.  I'll never forget my brother marrying a midwesterner. He'd gone with all these socialites. He was much more social than I was.  And his wife would iron in the living room she had on tennis shoes or something, and Mother told her that southerners, she said, "We work in the back, and then we change our clothes and go out looking like ladies, so if someone comes to call." M.F.: You said that there were always servants working in your house, and I wondered if you ever had a particularly close relationship with any of the servants. MacDougall:  Oh, yes, particularly this John, because when Mother was sick and I'd go up there to take care of herthis was after I marriedthe Seaboard gave me a pass to go back and forth. And so there wasn't anybody there but just John to talk to.  I remember once 30 he answered the phone and said, "Mr. McDow's butler." And Dad said, "Hell, I'm Mr. McDow, and we don't have any butler. Are.you John?" And then we had another one named Margaret.  She was about my age, very ignorant. This is before John.  I was at Agnes Scott. Margaret was superstitious, and she said she used to be scared to death of my father.  She used to cross the street.  Now she couldn't tell you why. Until she began to work for him, and then she really loved him. But Margaret said to Mother one day, "Mrs. Mary, can I get off Friday to go to a funeral?" And Mother said, "Certainly, you can go to the funeral." So on Friday Margaret showed up, and Mother said, "Margaret, I thought you were going to a funeral today." "Mrs. Mary, the man didn't die." All blacks love funerals, I mean that type blacks.  That's the only type I knew.  I was close to another one who worked for my cousin in Charlotte.  And my cousin Caroline came in, and this old black servant, Fanny, said, "Miss Caroline, you got a call." And Caroline said, "Who was it from, Fanny?" She says, "I don't know. It's writ down." And Caroline said, "Fanny you can't write." Fanny said, "I know it, but I thought you could read." Just scribble.  So I knew the servant of every aunt. M.F.: What about your own? Did you have a nurse when you were growing up? MacDougall:  Oh, always, and that was Sadie. M.F.: Were you particularly close to her? MacDougall:  I loved her.  I called her "my Sate." M.F.:  And did she stay with your family? MacDougall: Yes, she stayed a long time. And later she went up North, and I can't remember any of the other nurses. Now a mammy nursed 31 us before that, when I was just a tiny child, because I didn't weigh but four pounds when I was born, and Mammy was ashamed; she didn't want anybody to see me because I was so small. And as poor as she was, she had some itinerant painter paint her a picture of Thomas F., she loved him so. M.F.:  She brought someone into the house to paint him? MacDougall: Yes, into her little cabin to paint him.  She had a picture of him.  And I think later her cabin burned.  But we had another cook who used to bring her little boy, and he slept in the woodbox.  There was a great big box. You had a woodstove and then a kerosene stove.  And the wood for the stove would be in the kitchen. And Sam, her little boy, would sleep in that woodbox because she didn't have anybody to leave him with. M.F.: Where did these people live? Did they live really close to your house? MacDougall: There was a ravinewe called it a gully, but it was really a beautiful ravineand then there was Mammy's cabin up beyond there. But she'd get mad with her husband George because he was always coming home drunk, and I can hear her now yelling. We'd be sitting on the side porch, and she'd say, "You good-for-nothing nigger, you. I'm going to get Mr. Mac on you!" See, they love to have lawyers.  And I can see why: this is someone who is going to take up for them. And then I asked John one day...he was hurrying to get through serving dinner. I said, "John, what are you in such a hurry for?" He said, "I want to go to Sam Adams' funeral." I said, "Johnny, you didn't like Sam Adams. Why are you going to his funeral?" He said, "I just want to 32 see how a preacher preaches a sinner's funeral." He was always saying something strange and funny.  Mother wanted me to stay in York for a longer time once after I married, and I said, "I can't afford it, Mother. Bob eats in the restaurant of the apartment and I'm paying a servant, and it's just plain too expensive for me to stay up here." And John poked his head in the door and said, "Miss Margaret, I know Mr. Robert ain't got no business spending all that money, but he'd just like your dad; he just ain't no cheap man." M.F.:  Did you play with the children of... MacDougall: Yes, I guess I played with Sam, but I didn't live close to them and I can't remember any of their children.  Now Bob, my husband, did.  In fact, he played with the little black children all the time at his grandfather's house. M.F.: Who did you play with the most? MacDougall:  There were two other girls in our neighborhood, both a little older than I was, and the rest of them were boys.  So who I really played with were all the boys in the neighborhood. And they were foreversay one of them who later was with the telephone company as some kind of electricianthey would shock me on purpose, to see how loud I'd yell, I guess. M.F.: Did that stop? Did your mother ever say, "You shouldn't play with boys anymore."? MacDougall: No never. And she didn't take any part, except she did lean out the window sometime when someone was pulling Thomas F.'s curls or hitting him or something, and she said, "Hit him back, son, hit him back." But the boys in the neighborhood, I can remember one There were several Negro "settlements" in other parts of York. 33 of them pulled a handful out of my hair and hid it under a rock where his mother couldn't find it. M.F.: Rough playing, huh? MacDougall: Rough playing, yes. Just pulled my hair right out. So I grew up, I had to take it, climbed trees and everything else. Whatever they did, I did. M.F.: Did you have lots of cousins or relatives that you... MacDougall: Yes, I really did, and we were really close. We counted up once,  I can't remember whether it was just my mother's family or my father's, too, but I think it was mostly Mother's that I had about sixty first cousins.  And most of the cousins lived in Charlotte, North Carolina. We had one uncle who went to Texas, but the others lived in North Carolina. And we were forever visiting back and forth, and the ones that are living are still close to each other. M.F.: Your grandmother had five daughters and three sons? MacDougall: That's right. You asked me why I was named Margaret. Both her sons and all but two of her daughters named one child Margaret, which showed how fond they were of their mother and how much they admired her. M.F.: You were telling me about two of the daughters who married people who were owners of cotton mills. MacDougall:  One was the owner of a cotton mill, and the other one dealt in stocks. My uncle Rob Moore started working when he was thirteen to help to support his mother.  He was a delightful person, you never would have known that he hadn't had anything but a grade school education. A delightful gentleman if you ever saw one. And 34 he worked his way up, and he became, I think it was president or owner of the Rhodhiss Cotton Mills.  I think he must have had several. But Mr. Hiss was Alger Hiss's uncle. M.F.: Where were those cotton mills? MacDougall:  Isn't there such a place as Rhodhiss, North Carolina? I think there is.  I think they were in Rhodhiss, North Carolina.  I know they were not in Charlotte, although Uncle Rob lived in Charlotte. I thought it was so funny about Mr. Hiss being Alger Hiss's uncle, because Uncle Rob was so reactionary.  And he's the one who felt that Frank Graham was the devil himself, and so was Roosevelt. And Mother used to say she was going to get schizophrenia, that between Frank Graham and the family for him and against him, and Roosevelt and the family for him and against him, she said, "Sometimes I get to the point where I don't know what I believe." But she did believe.  She was liberal on account of Father and the influences of her life. M.F.: Do you remember your Uncle Rob ever talking about Alger Hiss or about his uncle? MacDougall: Never.  I think Uncle Rob was dead before Alger Hiss came on the scene. Well, he couldn't have been, because he lived long enough to hate Roosevelt. But I never remember him talking about it. M.F.: What about your other uncle? MacDougall:  Both of them are uncles-in-law, but my Aunt Caroline Clarkson married Brevard D. Springs. His brother, Leroy Springs, owned the Springs Cotton Mills. See that silver vase over there.  I could set my table in silver on just what the Springs 35 family gave us. Uncle Brevard dealt in the commodity market, because at one time he and O.P. Heath cornered the wheat market, and Uncle Brevard lost ninety thousand dollars. And Dad felt if Brevard could risk ninety, he'd borrow three thousand and put in, and of course he lost his, too.  It took him forever to pay it back.  I said, "Uncle Brevard, what did you do when you lost all your money?" He said, "I got drunk and O.P. committed suicide," which was the truth.  And then Uncle Brevard would sit....  They had a house that had stairways going up on either side, and back of the stairway was his rolltop desk, and he'd sit back there all the time. He played that market until he died.  But he always said that the reason he never could get richbecause his brothers called him every day from New York to know what to do, every daythat he would always want to stay in there too long for himself, but he wouldn't let the others. But after that it did make him bitter. He'd growl; I used to be scared to death of him 'til I knew that underneath he was not like that.  I mean he'd bring Aunt Carrie coffee in the morning, and I don't see how she took the way he growled at her, though; it was terrible. And he'd wear this funny old hat in the house. M.F.:  [laughter] MacDougall: And he went to bed at five o'clock in the afternoon and got up at two. I'd come in from a dance, and Uncle Brevard would still be up, all the doors open. Or I'd walk in at, say, dinnertime; that's the way our family was. I found Aunt Carrie on her knees many times. But if you just looked at her, and she really was a socialite. M.F.: On her knees doing what? 36 MacDougall: Praying. M.F.: What was the relationship with Leroy Springs? MacDougall: We were family friends. He took my mother to her first dance. BEGIN SIDE II TAPE II MacDougall: His first wife died, but she was the mother of Elliott Springs, who, after Mr. Leroy died, took charge of the Springs Cotton Mills. M.F.:  Do you remember any stories about the mills or about the people who worked in the mills? Did you have any feeling about industry, the changing from agriculture to industry, or that these people were part of the New South or that they were going to make everybody rich? What was the feeling about all these mills and that kind of industrial development? MacDougall:  I don't think I actually thought about it at that time.  I didn't have any real thoughts about it.  I knew how segregated the mill people were. And there was a Mr. Walter Moore in York. He ran some mill; it wasn't the Cannon Mills, so there must have been two mills in York. M.F.: But these people like Leroy Springs weren't Simon Legree types, were they? MacDougall: Dad had a client who had several children and all she had was a cow. And Leroy Springs had a mortgage on the cow, and Dad said, "That milk is all she has to feed her children Leroy. His brother Brevard married mother's sister, Carolina Clarkson. 37 Surely you're not going to take that cow." He said, "Take the cow." Anything for money. M.F.: So he really was... MacDougall:  So he really was money-conscious. And he didn't care what happened to those people. But on his deathbed, he told my father that he was the most unhappy person who ever lived. Now that's a terrible thing to live with. M.F.: What was his wife like? MacDougall:  His first wife I never knew.  His second wife was a lovely-looking woman who taught at Queens College.  She had brown hair and blue eyes.  I'll never forget how beautiful she was.  I can see her sitting in front of our fireplace, and she was watching Mr. Leroy because he drank too much.  And she went to the Democratic Convention, and I think he wanted her nominated for Vice President. Anyway, he gave a lot of money to get her name maybe placed in nomination; I'm not sure whether she was nominated or not. But he wanted her to be prominent.  She didn't know any more politics than a booger, but she had taught English, I think. But later on after he died she just had too much money, and I understood she went to pot. So Elliott is now dead, and his son-in-law runs those mills, a Mr. Close.  I don't know him, but I understand he's a fine person.1 M.F.: Did they live in Lancaster then? MacDougall: Mr. Leroy lived in Lancaster. He had his house in Lancaster. The mill was at Fort Mill, South Carolina. It's between Rock Hill and Charlotte. vThen I think it over, I knew lots of mill presidents and owners in Gastonia, North Carolina and Rock Hill, South Carolina as well as Belmont, North Carolina. I only knew them socially.  I was the age of their children. 38 M.F.: But then they got other mills, didn't they? They expanded pretty quickly. MacDougall: The Springs didn't, and I don't know about the Cannons, how many they had. The only ones I can remember were York and Kannapolls. M.F.: Which they own [laughter], the town. You had a lot of relationships with adults other than your parents. You had all of these aunts and uncles and cousins. MacDougall:  That's right.  Then mother made it a point to see that, since we lived in a small place, everyone who came to York for any reason who had a bright mind or whatnot would be invited to our house for dinner.  Like Mr. August Cohn, a Jewish man, brilliant, from Columbia, South Carolina. He taught at the University. There would be the lawyers. Dad would bring them home from court. Lawyers really aren't like doctors.  The difference is, they'll fight each other to the finish, and they get right out of that courtroom and one puts his arm around the other and says, "Come on home to dinner." M.F.:  [laughter] MacDougall:  So I heard all those lawyers talk. There were always people in our house. And Mother would say, "A minister brings a blessing to your house." So one night Dad shows up at about ten o'clock, and yells up to Mother upstairs, "Mary, come downstairs, I've brought you a blessing."  [laughter] And it was Dr, Davidson Douglas, who at that time, I believe, was President of Davidson College. So there were worlds of people I met. But Mother was disappointed that she couldn't introduce us to the world of art, only to books. 39 And we had a victrola with all the classic records like Caruso and so forth. M.F.: Did she ever take you on trips? Did you ever travel? MacDougall: We didn't have the money, which I think was sad, except to go to Little Switzerland, North Carolina in the summer. M.F.: But you never went to Washington or New York? MacDougall:  I did with my Dad after I finished school.  I never had been to Charleston, where most of my people came from and are buried, until in the twenties.  But Dad took me to Washington.  And the guide would be showing us some group and saying, "This is so-and-s and Dad says, "Oh, no, that's not; that's so-and-so."  He knew more history than the guide by a long shot.  I thought it was a shame, with all his background, that he didn't have the money really to travel. M.F.: Did they ever think about leaving York? MacDougall: Yes, they thought about just going to Rock Hill or Charlotte, which they certainly should have. Dad was entirely too big a person to stay in that small town. M.F.: Why do you think they didn't go? MacDougall:  I think Mother never wanted to go.  I think she was afraid Dad would get in with some wild crowd. M.F.: So things were more controlled in a small town? MacDougall:  I think so.  But at least he should have moved to Rock Hill. That was ridiculous, because most of his business came from there. And then like the Seaboard, the chief lawyer for the Seaboard was a Mr. Brittingham.  I have all this correspondence that Dad carried on with him. And Mr. Brittingham thought he was just 40 coming down to see this small-town lawyer, and it turned out to be anything but, and they became great friends. They always corresponded. M.F.:  I wanted to ask you what your school experiences were like. What did you think of schools when you first went? When you left horn, were you afraid to leave home? MacDougall:  I wasn't afraid to leave home, and I liked school and I liked all my playmates.  In fact there was one little girl a year older than we were named Alice Inman, and I used to love to hold her hand.  And then we would take our lunch to school, and then at recess you'd spread it all out and you'd swap things back and forth.  I remember we had little tiny biscuits like this, and the mill children had great big hunky biscuits.  It was food for them; for us it was dainty little this, that, and the other. And so the first lie I ever told, I'll never forget.  Somebody threw a great big biscuit.  The teacher said, "Who threw that biscuit?" And I never had been kept in after school, punished, so finally I said, "I did." And she knew darn well I didn't.  So she said, "Well, then, you can stay in. No one else can stay in." But the person who threw it, I wish I could show you a picture.  She was about a six-foot-tall-mill girl, and I wondered at what age you were accountable to the Lord for lying. M.F.: How old were you? MacDougall:  I was almost seven when I went to school. And the teacher used to tell us to read our lesson five times. Well, I just didn't do it. We should have had ungraded schools; I still believe in ungraded schools. Because I could have gone so much faster than most of the people in my room at that time. I can point 41 out a few who could go much faster, too. But then also, I think the experience there again, that you were in there with all types of people, poor whites....  Not blacks.                                                                                        * M.F.: The black children in York had another school? MacDougall:  They had another school. M.F.: Did you ever have any contact with their school? MacDougall:  None whatsoever. M.F.: When your dad was chairman of the school board, did he have contact with the black school? MacDougall: Yes. M.F.:  Did they have their own school board? MacDougall:  No.  They had their own school.  The only thing was, in his will he said that any book that we didn't want, give it to the Negro library. But no, no contact. And years later (I'm getting off the subject, but it all ties in) Martin Luther King, Sr. celebrated either his birthday or an aniversary, and some of us who went together decided we'd sit at different tables.  So I sat by a most attractive young girl, black, whose husband was a lawyer for the C and S Bank, and I asked her where she was from.  And she said York, South Carolina, and I said I was, too. And it came to be that I knew her family.  So I told my nephew when I got home, and he said, "And you never would have met her in York, South Carolina, would you?" and I said, "Never on this earth." M.F.:  How did you know her family? MacDougall: They were quite substantial blacks, and we know all the substantial blacks in town. 42 M.F.: You just sort of knew who they were? MacDougall:  You knew what they did.  One of them would be a good carpenter.  I think her father had a dry cleaning establishment.  Somebody wrote a book about York which was called Black and White?  It was written about the blacks and the whites in York, South Carolina. It was someone at the University of North Carolina who wrote that book. M.F.:  Millsways of Kent? 1 MacDougall:  Yes.  That's York, South Carolina. M.F.: Have you read that? MacDougall: Yes, I've read it. M.F.: What did you think of it? MacDougall:  I thought it was absolutely accurate.  It couldn't have been more accurate. M.F.: John Moreland is the fellow who wrote it. When you were at school, there were basically two different groups of people, the mill children and the other children from town, right? MacDougall: That's right. And from town there was everything from the top to the bottom. M.F.: Were there any distinctions in there, sort of subtle ones? MacDougall: Yes. There are always, I guess, little cliques. But, as I look over it, I associated with all of them. To me there wasn't any difference.  I liked them. M.F.: But the only children your mother wouldn't let you have into the home were the mill children, right? The Black Ways of Kent The White Ways of Kent 43 MacDougall: That's right. And the poor whites wouldn't be invited to your birthday party. M.F.: Like a carpenter's son or something?                                   c MacDougall:  I can remember one that was a real poor family, but I didn't particularly like her.  There weren't any that I really liked, except the mill children, that I really wanted to have.  The only one I can remember wanting to have was one of the mill children. M.F.: How did your mom deal with that? MacDougall:  She just didn't say.  She just never gave me any answer.  I never got an answer; of course, she didn't have one. M.F.:  Didn't that sort of upset you, or did you not argue? MacDougall: No, I didn't argue with her.  I thought my parents hung the moon to too great extent.  I listened to them to too great an extent.  I should have rebelled much more than I did. M.F.: So you just sort of accepted what they said. MacDougall:  I accepted what they said, except it still didn't make sense. M.F.:  [laughter]  I wondered if there was a teacher who particularly influenced you when you were in school in York? MacDougall: Oh, yes.  I had two excellent teachers in high school, one in history and English, a Miss Margaret Marion, and another in Latin, Mr. Rambo. He said there were only two girls that he'd ever taught in Latin that he'd given an 'A' to, and one was from Chester and the other one was me. But he was such a terrific teacher that my background.... And Miss Margaret Marion taught me, for instance, to just love The Lady of the Lake when I never could see any sense to poetry. And Dad used to pay me to learn it. 44 M.F.:  [laughter] Pay you to learn it, MacDougall: He did; I'll never forget. He paid me to learn Tennyson's "Break, break, break, on thy cold grey stones, oh, sea." And when I would say I didn't like poetry, he'd say, "The fault, Dear Brutus, is in thine own eye." So Miss Marion taught me, really to like poetry. M.F.: When you were in school, what did they teach you about the Civil War and about being southerners? Did you as a southerner have any sort of inferiority complex about being in the South or seeming a part of... MacDougall:  Oh, never.  I was proud of being a southerner.  But the history books were written completely from a southern point of view, because the history book we studied was written by a cousin of mine, Waddy Thompson, whose father was Governor Hugh Thompson of South Carolina.  And it was written from the southern point of view. But my father taught me that this wasn't the way it was. You'd have thought he was a Yankee. He was fair about everything. He was really interested in getting at the truth.  But I can remember we had Memorial Day speakers.  I can remember old Colonel Coward speaking on Memorial Day. M.F.: You said that the United Daughters of the Confederacy was an important organization. MacDougall: I guess it was. Mother belonged because her father had been wounded at Fort Sumter, which was the first battle of the War.  But I can't remember Mother being particularly interested in it. She was more interested in the DAR, but Mother really was in- She could also make Shakespeare come to life. 45 terested in history. And instead of being like the DAR is now, which is anathema to me, she really liked history and studied history. M.F.: You said there was a children's group for the United Daughters of the Confederacy. MacDougall:  There was, Children of the Confederacy, the Winnie Davis Chapter of the Children of the Confederacy.* And all I can remember about that is the UDC's older people had a convention in York, and that's when I said a little rhyme called "Me and Mammy Know a Child About My Age and Size." That's all I can remember about it. Anyway, [laughter] I have a picture here of my mammy.  That's a shame.  I showed it to tell somebody.  I can't find it.  She had not been a slave in our family, because her name was Melton and we came from the low country. M.F.:  But she had been a slave. MacDougall:  But she had been a slave, yes, in the Melton family. M.F.: My word. Did she ever talk about that? MacDougall: No, but I'll tell you who did talk about it, and this was when I was grown. Because when I was holding elections I taught a course on citizenship at Atlanta University one summer.  It was for the Presbyterian Church. They were having some type of seminar. And when these black women felt that I was dealing with them on the level, you should have heard the stories they told me about their fathers and their grandfathers and the whites and how the white men took the black mistresses and all that. And I knew it in York. In fact I knew some of the Negroes and who their fathers were supposed *SeeAppendix II 46 to be, white men. And you could see a resemblance. M.F.: How did that come down? How did you know that? MacDougall:  I think my mother told me. But there were a lot of things she didn't tell me. M.F.:  Just sort of whispering or... MacDougall:  It was all sort of underground.  I can't imagine Dad doing anything underground. He may have told us outright.  I guess he did. But they didn't tell me about a man who was a homosexual. I found out later, but they didn't tell me. The children at school told me. M.F.: But they knew, you're sure. MacDougall: Yes, that's right. M.F.:  It's always interesting to me how stories like that and how connections like that get filtered down, how everyone sort of knows, but Lillian Smith said every southern woman knows all of the miscegenation that took place in every family but her own. MacDougall: That is exactly right.  I had not thought about that. I'm so sorry I didn't go to meet her.  She asked me up there once, and I couldn't go. But her books are really true. M.F.: Remember her book Killers of the Dream? MacDougall:  I can't remember that, but I remember I read it.  I can't remember it; I don't have a very good memory. But I can remember Strange Fruit. M.F.: Do you remember when that came out? Did you read it then? MacDougall: I read it when it came out. I had copies of all those books. 47 M.F.: What did you think about it? Did it hit the nail on the head?                                                                                         .-..,, MacDougall:  I thought it was very true. By that time I had absolutely changed all my thinking, just gradually.  I felt that Wm. Percy1 in Mississippi, that was the way I was brought up, to think like he thought. But then I just matured and grew in my thinking from associating with different people. M.F.:  If you look back, can you point to any particular incident that made you change your mind or any particular people who made you change your mind? MacDougall:  I was working in political campaigns with these prominent educated Negroes, and I had to toy with my conscience, you know:  is this right or is it wrong?  I remember I was against the FEPC, and Josephine Wilkins was for it, and we used to argue.  She was ahead of her time.  I went to civil rights meetings and heard the side that the Negroes....  And then you got to know these people. M.F.: What about things like eating meals with blacks and things that had always been really forbidden? Was it hard to do these? MacDougall: No, never, it was never hard for me to do that. We had blacks in our home long before most people did.  The Negroes didn't have a stadium, and Bob's company built the first stadium that they had at cost. And he supervised it and did the engineering for it.  It's at Morris Brown College now. Two Negroes appreciated it, and they came out to our house to see us,  and then others we had to dinner when other people didn't. And people would say, "What do your neighbors think?" and I said I could care less. Tta. Percy, Lanterns on the Levee 48 M.F.: But this was after you were married? '- MacDougall:  That's right. But not in York, South Carolina. No, we did not. M.F.: But it wasn't hard for you to go from having been reared... I'm assuming that you were reared to think it was wrong to sit down at the table as an equal and eat with a black person. MacDougall: We never really thought of it, because in York there wasn't a single educated black person. M.F.:  But educated or uneducated, you just wouldn't do it, would you? MacDougall:  I don't think so.  We didn't anyway.  I don't think it ever occurred to me to even think about it. M.F.: It's interesting that it wasn't hard to have blacks out into your house. MacDougall: When my brother was doing War work, which was about thirty-four years agothat's about Thomas's agehe was in Richmond, so his wife got a job as a dietician at the college there. And my brother said, "Margaret, do you know these professors think that Negroes are equal to white people? What do you think about that? What do you think Dad would have thought?" And I said, "Well, I think Dad would have grown with the times. He was a product of his time, but I think if he lived now he'd still be ahead of his time." M.F.: So it was something you could fit into. We were really taught to try to grow, that your education, that all you got in school was just sort of an introduction, that you really had to keep on learning and keep on changing your mind.  So it just never was hard for me. Talking about eating with Negroes. You see, there was a 49 law in Georgia.... Of course, the United States law supersedes the state law, but these states Would never admit that. And so one day Adam Toombs called me up one Saturday night and said, "Margaret, I'm going to tell you what let's do. Let's go eat at a Negro restaurant," And it was when the Negroes were having the lie-in's.  They'd lie across the street and they'd go and eat in a certain restaurant, and they weren't supposed to eat together. Adah said, "Let's go and eat in a Negro restaurant, and then we'll get Herbert Jenkins, the Police Chief, to arrest us.  That old judge that gives the Negroes such high bonds, he wouldn't dare do that to us, so then he'd have to lower their bonds." And I said, "Wait a minute, Adah, Bob's always stood behind me but he's out of town, and I just don't think he'd like to come back here and find me in jail." And she said, "Oh, that's ridiculous.  I can get ten other people to do it." So the next week I said, "Adah, what happened about going to jail?" "The only thing Henry ever asked me not to do." M.F.:  [laughter] MacDougall:  "Herbert Jenkins says, 'Listen, Adah, I'm in enough trouble with my enemies.  Please don't my friends cause me any more.'" M.F.:  But she was perfectly willing to do it... MacDougall:  She wanted to do it.  She could think up all these ways of getting things done that I would never in this world have thought of. But it would have been one way. M.F.: Did anyone else do that? MacDougall: No, they didn't.  But later on, I can remember eating in a Negro restaurant. The night Martin Luther King was shot, 50 we were down at Pascal's. That's a Negro restaurant. I remember sitting down there. And the feeling was really running high. You could just feel it, cut it with a knife. M.F.: It was a bad time.  I was wondering if there were any experiences in high school that stand out as being really important to you. When you were getting older, before you went to Agnes Scott. Was that still a real happy time? MacDougall:  I can't actually remember anything much about it, except just going to parties and dances and the things that young girls are interested in. Going with boys and having dates and all the usual things, but I can't remember anything in particular. M.F.:  Then when you decided to go to college, I wondered why you chose Agnes Scott. MacDougall: My father told me that I could go anywhere in the United States I wanted to go that I could get in, and he was going to take me and show me the colleges. Well, I adored this cousin of mine, Margaret Bland who's Margaret Sewell.  She was around here last night; she came up here at ten o'clock to help me remember some of this stuff. And she went.  So Dad took me down there, and it was on a Thanksgiving holiday, and they had a big dance and I thought they had such fun.  And I thought that's the way it was going to be all the time. And I didn't go anywhere else.  I said, "This is where I want to go." And Miss McKinney, the English teacher there... BEGIN SIDE I TAPE III Basketball, swimming, riding my bike, driving my pony cart. 51 M.F.: Miss McKinney said you were too immature to... MacDougall: Too immature, and she hoped I wouldn't get in, but I did get in. Because I had skipped a year in high school. For instance, I've never actually studied American history; I never had a course in it.  I've never had a course in political science. And I should have gone to a prep school a year before I went to Agnes Scott, but instead I made up the subjects that I lacked. They just didn't have the money to send me to a prep school and then Agnes Scott, and then my brother was at a private school since he was thirteen years old. M.F.: Why did he go to a private school and you went to a public school? MacDougall: Because he wouldn't study [laughter], and there was some epilepsy in my father's family and Mother was afraid to push him too much on account of that. Incidentally, it's just showed up in my oldest nephew; just a very mild case, but he had it. And so she sent him and he was thirteen years old, and I think he felt rejected.  I don't think she should have... M.F.: You mean to go away to school. MacDougall: To go away to school. You can take it two ways. And then he told me later that he felt that he missed a lot by not going to a public school, that he got in with a lot of wealthy boys who played around. M.F.: What was it like when you came to Agnes Scott? Did you like it? 52 MacDougall: When I came I got the worst teachers.  I used to be bored by it. And I had never flunked anything in my life, and I flunked a trig test. But so did my best friend, who's a Phi Beta Kappa; everybody flunked it. And I was in tears over flunking something. No, I really didn't like it.  I hate to say that, but I didn't.  Because the girls were too homogeneous, and I felt like in a lot of ways I was way ahead of them in the broad education that I had had at our dinner table. M.F.: Where did most of these women come from? MacDougall:  They were southern, and most of them were upper middle class Presbyterians.  I can't remember but two Jewish women at Agnes Scott. M.F.: Was it real religious? Did you have to go to chapel? MacDougall: Yes, it was supposed to be, and we had to go to chapel.  And I would have gone anyway.  It was supposed to be religious it was affiliated with the Presbyterian Churchbut I felt like it was religiosity and piety more than what I'd call real religion.  For instance, it just surprises me when I think of how interested I was in religion that I didn't take part in anything in the YWCA at Agnes Scott. M.F.: What was the "Y" like at Agnes Scott? MacDougall: My roommate was the president, and they were just a lot of pious kind of people. M.F.: Did they just sort of get together and pray? MacDougall: Yes, and read the Bible. And talk about religion, but when it came to anything about "What do you do for your fellow man?" it never occurred to them. Never thought about it. Never connected with life, so far as I was concerned. Now we did have groups that 53 went out, because I know I went with them and worked with the poor children in day nurseries and whatnot. But that wasn't through the YWCA. .._. M.F.: Do you remember what it was through? MacDougall:  I can't remember. M.F.: But that kind of activity wasn't really emphasized. MacDougall:  No.  That kind of activity was not really emphasized. M.F.: The views that you'd grown up with, the ideas that you had about race and about class and southern society in general, did they change at all while you were at Agnes Scott? MacDougall: When I was at Agnes Scott, there again I felt I was far ahead of most of those girls socially.  I had been brought up in a more socially sophisticated atmosphere than most of them had been brought up in.  It seems strange that I say on the one hand immature, but then in some ways more mature. And I think that my cousing Margaret Sewell... I wish you knew her.  I looked extremely frivolous, and yet I was extremely serious;  and she looked extremely serious, and in some ways she was more frivolous than I was.  But I felt that I didn't live up to my mother's idea of "You ought to be popular" and all that. And a lot of these girls, being older, had dates and all sooner than I did. And then if I ever hooked anybody, some boy from my hometown would come and say, "You don't mean you're going with that baby." But later on I found my own friends.  I finally found the friends, and they were the girls who were studious and who were lifetime friends. M.F.: Who were some of these people? MacDougall: One of them was Mary Hemphil Green, who later 54 taught English, and I used to visit her in Abbeville, South Carolina. Her father and my father were friends. And she didn't ever go with boys much. And I loved it, because Mr. Green liked us to have dates and he didn't care how late we stayed out because he wanted Mary to have dates. And then her first cousin, Jim Coleman, started going with me, and he was brilliant. M.F.: What was your contact with other colleges in Atlanta, with Emory or Georgia Tech or Atlanta University? Did you have a lot of friends out in Atlanta? MacDougall:  I had a lot of friends in Atlanta itself.  I had my cousin J.M. Tull; you know the J.M. Tull Auditorium out at Emory? He married my first cousin, and I'd go to their house all the time for weekends.  If you went for a weekend, you could do anything you wanted to. Whatever Elizabeth and Joe Tull would let me do, I could do.  I was their responsibility, not Agnes Scott's.  I would go down to Covington and visit with my friend Mary Jarmon, whose father was head of that school in Covington, Emory at Oxford, Dr. Jarmon. Then he was later President of Mary Baldwin. And I figured now that the girls I picked out.... Now like Mary Jarmon was smart.  She was musical and a lot of fun, and she was Mrs. McCain's niece. And I went with her. But those two interested me. M.F.: So you could get away from Agnes Scott.  ..i : MacDougall: Yes, I went away, and then I visited the Edwards family here. They were architects. He did most of the buildings at Agnes Scott, Edwards and Seward. And he and my father had gone to the University of South Carolina together. Then I went with a 55 Presbyterian minister's daughter, and he had a son and a daughter and he didn't care what we did; we could stay out all night long. M.F.: At this time wasn't Agnes Scott really restrictive? MacDougall: Yes, it was. M.F.:  But this was the way you got around it* MacDougall: As I've told my nephew, "I don't care if you don't make all 'A's.'  I didn't make all 'A's.'" He said, "Well, you made 'A' in husband-catching." and I said, "Well, I think that's what I majored in," which was true, I think.  I had a good time.  And I'd study, but I'd study hard if they made me.  If I had had stimulating teachers....  There were some there if I had picked them out, but I was too young to pick out the stimulating teachers.  It was there for me. M.F.:  Did you want to do anything in particular when you came to Agnes Scott? Did you want to get married or did you want to have a career? You said you maybe wanted to be a missionary. MacDougall: Yes, first I wanted to be a missionary, and then I wanted to...I think I wanted to get married. M.F.: Really? MacDougall: Yes, I really think I wanted to get married.  I think every girl really wants to get married. Then I wanted to be a social worker, and Dad thought I was too young.  I wanted to contribute something to the world, because I had been brought up that way, that you had to pull your own weight. You've been given these advantages, and therefore, instead of the world owing you a living you owe the world something. M.F.: Do you think if times were different now, you might have 56 gone ahead and followed your dad's career? A lot more women are going to law school now than were when you... .......  - - ". MacDougall:  I don't think I would have, because I think still that I had just as interesting a life.... The League of Women Voters took the place of going to law school. M.F.: You think it really was that substantial? MacDougall: To me it was, yes. Now when you speak about friends, most of my closest friends to this day are friends that I made in the League of Women Voters.  They were the people who wanted to keep on learning.  I think that's the one thing in common that practically everybody in the League had:  they wanted to learn.  And now I've had this trouble for about ten years, and there's not a Saturday that one of my Jewish friends I met in the League doesn't call me up and ask me what she can do for me. And she has a fulltime public relations job.  So I found that when I had the nerve to make my friends around common interests, then I was happy. Arid at Agnes Scott I finally made my friends around our common interests. M.F.: But it took a while, [laughter] MacDougall: Yes, it did. . M.F.: We talked a little about organizations at Agnes Scott but what were the things that you did at Agnes Scott that were really most important to you, that you liked? MacDougall:  I always loved to draw, and I was on the Poster Someone has said that friendship is a triangletwo people with a common interest. I had old family friends, church friends, political friends, Agnes Scott friends, business friends. 57 Committee.  I used to draw or make posters every Monday afternoon. And then I was on the staff of the college paper, the Agonistic.  I was a reporter, and then I wrote the society part called "Giddy Gossip. Then Blackfriars, the dramatic club, and the Greek Club. We put on a play in Greek, and I was the heroine and I forgot my lines in the middle of it. Here were all these Ph.D.'s and whatnot.  I couldn't figure what to do, so I started just saying Greek rhymes and they didn't know the difference, nobody but the teacher, 'til I could get back on the track.  But I liked that. M.F.: You said you did some debating. MacDougall: Yes, I did debating. I think I got in the Debating Club on the subject "Women Should Have the Right to Vote," and I took the negative, which seems very strange. M.F.:  What was it like? Did you just not think about things, or were people really trying to figure out... MacDougall:  Oh, no, they gave me a subject.  I couldn't pick my own.  I would not have picked that side. M.F.: At that time you wouldn't have? MacDougall: At that time I wouldn't have.  I don't think I ever would have.  I would have picked that women should vote.  I didn't take any part in college politics like wanting to be president of this, that and the other, or working for people to be president of this, that and the other. I just didn't care.  I had my friends like Mary Jarmon, and I just went with them and went out with boys and enjoyed it. M.F.: Were there any larger political issues that were really important when you were at Agnes Scott that people were arguing about, like peace or war or...[laughter] 58 MacDougall: Yes. They were arguing about tariffs, because it was right after the First World War. And one of these high tariff s-:-I can't remember the name of the billsome people felt it was really one of the causes of the War, this high tariff. M.F.: So they wanted to get rid of the tariff. MacDougall:  Yes.  I did. M.F.: But there were not many issues closer to home. MacDougall: No.  I came right before people like Dr. Arthur Raper.  I figured life would have been entirely different had I had Dr. Raper as a teacher. M.F.:  Did you hear about him later? MacDougall:  Later, yes.  Lots of my friends.  I'm going to ask Liza.  One of his students wrote this article about me which I think was the most accurate picture of Bob and me that anyone ever wrote, called "She Studied Bible to Train for Politics."* And she worked in all these things.  She was very far out. M.F.: What was her name? MacDougall: Her name was Liza King. Her father was a lawyer. M.F.: Liza Paschall? MacDougall: Liza Paschall.  She married Walter Paschall. M.F.:  I'll put in an anecdote of my own.  She and my mother were friends. And when my mother got married she borrowed Liza Paschall's wedding veil and wore it. *See Appendix IX 1Fordney McCumber Tariff. Also the Inter-Allied War Debts. 59 MacDougall: Well, do you know that? Liza offered my niece her wedding veil.                          ... .. M.F.: It's a beautiful veil, [laughter] MacDougall: Absolutely beautiful, and she offered it to my oldest nephew's wife, but she had one she wanted to wear. Isn't that interesting. And somebody told me that Liza had taken up Christian Science, so I'm going to see if she can convert me. M.F.:  But you didn't know her at Scott? MacDougall: No, she came after me.  She followed me in practically everything, in Chairman of the Board of the Georgia League of Women Voters.  That's where I knew her, was in the League of Women Voters. And then our fathers had been friends. Her father was absolutely one of the most delightful people you could ever meet in your life, the typical old southern gentleman from the lower part of South Carolina, Mr. King.  So you tell your mother... M.F.: I heard that she was trying to write her memoirs. MacDougall: Really? I'll call her and ask her. She's had some things published in the Atlantic Monthly. M.F.: And she was so active here in the sixties. MacDougall:  I haven't see Liza in a long time, and none of this really is their fault; it's mine.  I just have not been able to keep up with my closest friends; there's no way.  So I really don't know what she's doing now. Everybody says she's really happy with her second husband. And so I'll call her. That'll give me a good excuse to call. M.F.: When you were at Scott, then, you didn't really get involved in any kind of writing or any of the work that you went on to do later. 60 MacDougall: No, not at all. And I never had a course in political science. And I'd hate to really tape this and put it down, because Agnes Scott has been so good to me and I mean that, but my mother felt that I retrogressed at Agnes Scott, that I went backward. M.F.:  Did they ever try to get you to go somewhere else? MacDougall: Yes, Mother and Dad both. They felt that I should go to the University of South Carolina, a co-ed school, or Chapel Hill, that the students were too homogeneous and too narrow-minded in a way, too much the same type of people. M.F.: Why didn't you go? MacDougall:  I felt that if I started something I should finish it.  I was just determined I was going to finish it. M.F.:  So you just went on through and did the best you could. MacDougall:  So I went on through and just....  I enjoyed it, because I enjoyed what I did outside.  I enjoyed it all right.  I wasn't unhappy. But neither can I say that I really would have chosen it again. M.F.: Then your last year there, you really started seeing the man you later married, Bob MacDougall. MacDougall: I actually met him when I was a freshman, but it was in my senior year when I really dated him all the time. M.F.: Arid did you want to get married then right after you finished? MacDougall: Then you didn't marry people unless they had a job; I mean most people I knew didn't. And he went down to Florida. It took him a year longer to finish Tech. He was sick. He had 61 appendicitis and he had to drop out.  So he went to Florida to make some money, and not only didn't make any but lost some. Just had to get a job down there and finally he started cutting timber 2 that his mother owned for her,  and we just went ahead and got married. And when I said to my mother-in-law once, "I just can't understand these young people; they just get married or nothing," she said, "That's what worried me so when you and Bob got married." M.F.: Did you really have nothing? MacDougall:  He had a job.  And one reason I liked him was because, even while he was in school, while his mother and father paid his tuition he ran the fraternity house and made all of his spending money.  And I never felt that when he took me out he was spending money like my brother's money that came off his mother and father, that Bob had made that money and he wanted to spend it on me, so I never felt bad about it.  I mean I admired him; I liked him. M.F.: What was he in at Georgia Tech? MacDougall: He took a general course, and then later on, he just got awarded everything in the world.  He got to be a full civil engineer. He didn't study at Georgia Tech, not very much.  [Reads from Blue print.]  Senior Class, Engineering, Mechanical.  "Robert Leak MacDougall.  "Mac." General Science. Much may me made of a Scotchman if he be taught young.  Thomas Dixon might have a fit subject for another story for The Clansman in our mighty Mac, here presented to view, not of the rise of the knight, but rather of those sturdy Scotchmen of the banks and braes of Bonnie Doon. A Scotsman from During the real estate boom and "bust." Wilson-MacDougall Lumber Company 62 Philadelphia.  [His father was up there teaching.]  If Mac is a Yankee, we know we'll never fall out with the North over any question under the sun, Oil Can Club and the American Association of Mechanical Engineers." So that doesn't say anything, really. But afterwards they presented him with...,ANAK Society, I think you call it, for the outstanding students, and he got it after he had graduated.  In other words, he like myself, did much more after graduating than before. M.F.:  That's interesting that both of you were like that.  So then, while Bob was trying to earn some money so you could get married, you went on and did several different things. MacDougall:  Yes.  I went to school.  I went to a training school in Richmond for several months, from Christmas to the end of the semester, and had one wonderful teacher there, the one who taught about the Presbyterian Church, the history of it, Dr. Walter Lingle.  He was the President of Davidson later.  It was called the Assembly's Training School for Lay Workers.  It was across the street from the seminary, and actually the same teachers who taught at the seminary, some of them taught at the training school.  And we had some very good teachers, and I learned a lot up there. M.F.: This is an interesting thing. Were the lay people mainly women, and the seminary students were mainly men? MacDougall:  Right.  All men.  One of the women that I went to school with is a minister in the Presbyterian Church, Rachael Henderlite, and about four weeks ago they gave three alumnae what they call a Distinguished Service Award, and she was one of them for her work.  She's a Presbyterian minister, the first one in the Presbyterian Church. 63 And then mine for work in the community. And the other one for loyalty to Agnes Scott, and she said when she got up that She wasn't adequate, and my cousin Margaret Sewell said to me later, "You know, she wasn't."  [laughter] But Racheal, I was so disappointed, because I felt, oh, I had been in her home; she had visited in mine; and we're going to renew old times. My word, I don't think she could have cared less about seeing me or ever remembering me, and I really was so disappointed. M.F.:  Both of you were at Richmond? MacDougall:  We were at Richmond.  Her father came to have dinner with us.  I couldn't work that first year.  I had a job to teach Bible, but I couldn't work because I was supposed to have had TB.  I lost my voice.  So then I got okay, and I wanted to do something.  And he told me that his daughter was going to this training school and that's what I ought to do.  So I said, "Well, I believe I will," so that's what I did.  So the relationship with her father and all that, but she was so pompous and so sort of impressed with herself.  I was just amazed, really.  It was a disappointment. M.F.: When was she ordained as a minister? MacDougall:  It must have been years ago, because she's just a little younger than I am.  She taught at Austin Theological Seminary. M.F.: Then after you left Richmond, you went to teach Bible in... MacDougall:  Holly Springs, Mississippi, the Mississippi Synodical College. The Presbyterian Church has church courts, and the synod is the state organization, so they called it "synodical." It was actually under the church. Agnes Scott was only affiliated with the church, but this was under the church. And it later merged with Belhaven College, 64 which is still in Jackson, Mississippi. M.F.: How did you happen to go there? MacDougall:  I'd always been termed Dad's daughter or Bill's sister of Margaret Bland Sewell's cousin, so I decided I wanted to be myself, and I wanted to go where nobody had ever heard of me and see if I could make it on my own.  So I went out there. M.F.: How did you get offered that job? MacDougall:  I wrote letters around to the various Presbyterian schools.  And this is how idealistic I was; I wanted to put in there that I didn't care about the salary; anything they paid me was alright; I just wanted to do the work.  See, that's the missionary spirit coming out.  And so the superintendent of the schools looked over the letter. He said, "That's nuts." So after one year, there wasn't anything to do.  I mean there weren't many boys; that's what girls are interested in. M.F.:  Now were you officially engaged at that time? MacDougall: Yes, but Bob didn't care. He knew that I liked to have a good time.  I didn't have my ring, but I was officially engaged. So we'd go up to Memphis every weekend, and I got bored not having much to do. And so Dr. Cooper, the President, told me that I should stay two years.  Said, "I'm going to raise your salary, but it isn't that. For your record. After this you can change as much as you want, but the first place you get a job you should stay two years." And I think he was right.  So I did stay the second year. And some of the members of the faculty I still correspond with. ^I suppose the young people today would say I was "seeking my identity." 65 M.F.: Did you like teaching? MacDougall:  I loved it.  I really loved it. M.F.: Did you have good students? MacDougall: I had. I must admit that there were some that I liked better than others. M.F.: But the teaching itself was good; it was the social life that was bad. MacDougall:  It was the social life.  I love the teaching.  It was just the lack of any social life for young girls. M.F.:  So you stayed two years and then came back. MacDougall:  I stayed two years, and then I went to Winthrop College.  And in the meantime I had gone to Cornell and taken some more French, and I was really an instructor.  I had a good ear for sound and pronunciation and grammar through my Latin and whatnot, and then I'd been to Cornell. And the way I really got that job was that the president of the school said, "If that young lady is as smart as her father, she'll be alright." BEGIN SIDE II TAPE III M.F.: You had made it in Mississippi. MacDougall:  I had made it in Mississippi. M.F.: You could have stayed on and on if you wanted to. MacDougall:  I could have stayed on and on if I wanted to. And after that... M.F.: You could go back to South Carolina. 66 MacDougall: Yes, I could go back. And I enjoyed going back after that. Because you go away where no one knows you and have to make your own way.... But then it surely is nice to come back and be able to be where everybody knows you. And Dr. Cooper i Mississippi did write me a reference in which he said, "I recommend her without reserve," and then he said to me, "This is the highest recommendation I can give anybody, because if you say a lot the person will always look for what's left out.  But when you say 'without reserve' that just says it." M.F.: What did you think of teaching at Winthrop? Did you enjoy that as much? MacDougall: Yes, except I didn't really like teaching French as much as I liked teaching Bible.  I far preferred to teach Bible. I taught some French and Latin in Mississippi, too, because they didn't have enough teachers. M.F.: So at the end of the year at Winthrop you decided to get married. MacDougall: Yes, in 1928. M.F.: Did you want to go ahead and continue teaching? MacDougall: What I really wanted to do was have children. And it really literally almost killed me.  And Adah Toombs says that that isn't so; if I'd cared that much, I would have adopted children. And I said no, I'd taught children who were adopted who weren't quite right and so forth. And if I had a child who turned out to be a juvenile delinquent, I would have felt, "Alright, this is my child.  I'll do everything I can." But if I had adopted the 67 child, I'd have thought, "Now I wonder what ever made me do this." M.F.: And you didn't want to feel that way. MacDougall: And I'm glad I didn't.  I think you have compensations. And I think later, I feel, it was better that I didn't have children because I could go places with my husband and meet all his friends. And at one time my mother was sick, and everyone in the family who was sick had to stay at my house.  I did a lot of taking care of people. But I really didn't like taking care of people. Anyway, I got into a lot of church work, and then the League of Women Voters. M.F.: And all your political work. MacDougall:  All my political work, which grew out of my family background and the League of Women Voters. M.F.:  Did most of the women you were involved with have children? MacDougall: Yes. When I first came to Atlanta, my friends I went to Agnes Scott with had children.  I remember one of them was a lawyer, and she'd had a little boy. But most of them had children. M.F.:  So do you think, even if you had had children, that you would have gotten involved in all the political work? MacDougall:  I said once to one of the women in the League of Women Voters, "You would have never seen me here if I had had children. I'd be at home teaching them history." She said, "And suppose they wouldn't want to study history?" M.F.:  [laughter] MacDougall: Which was a very good point.  But I was completely happy.  I forgot all about it. And I literally had other people's children.... I think maybe I gave you those things written when my 68 husband died about other people's children.* And to this day I can call on any of them. My house was always full of children. M.F.: But when you first married, you really planned to change your whole life. MacDougall: Yes, I w,as going to have children.  And I told everyone, "Now don't blame it on my husband.  I want at least thirteen." And then not tp have any. I did take a job teaching at a little French school in fhe first grade for one year.  I got fifty dollars a month to tpach two hours a day after we married.  Just to have something to do. {Someone fell out at the last minute, and the teacher wanted just someon^ who had a degree.  Said she'd shew me how to teach the first grade.  They had only five students.  So I did that and liked it. But th^n the next year she couldn't even pay me fifty dollars a month. Nobody h,ad anything. M.F.:  So then after that you really planned to just make your home. MacDougall: Yes.  I loved to entertain. But at that time I could do three things at opce. And I can remember being at a conference in Richmond on a Friday; op that Saturday mailing out four hundred of these pamphlets, ministers' statements;  on Sunday having thirty people to dinner that night with one maid; and then getting pneumonia and being in the hospital on Monday morning. But I'd do all those three things at once. Hold an election at the same time; everything. *See Appendix~~X: Column and two editorials published after Bob's death. 1"Minister's Manifesto,'' Published and distributed by Executive Committee, United Church Women. 69 Night and day.  It didn't bother me.                        lC M.F.: Why don't we stop for today and pick that up tomorrow? MacDougall:  Okay, swell. [Interruption in tape] M.F.: Today why don't we begin with talking about the early years of your marriage when you moved to Atlanta and set up housekeeping here permenantly.  Your husband was involved in the lumber business? MacDougall:  Yes, he was in the lumber business.  And his family owned timberland.  So he went out and set up a business and cut and sold timber. And then when the Depression came along, he had just enough money to pay off his people.  So he then got a job with the WPA when it started, because my father had known a man in South Carolina, Alan Johnstone.  Daddy had been on the Ways and Means Committee in the legislature with Alan's father. And it was through my father Bob got his job. And then afterwards, I have a letter that Alan Johnstone wrote Dad, thanking him for letting him have Bob MacDougall and putting him in touch with him. M.F.: So he started working with the WPA in Georgia, though, not in South Carolina.       I; . MacDougall:  In Georgia. That's right. Johnstone was in South Carolina. M.F.: And was Bob involved with it from the time it first started? MacDougall:  From the time it really first started, Gay Shepperson, Bob MacDougall, R.L. Lane, and R.L. Van Sant. There were three departments, and Gay was the head, and these other three people were her 70 assistants. M.F.:  So his decision to go into government work was really predicated on the fact that his business couldn't keep going during the Depression. MacDougall:  Oh, absolutely. We didn't have any money whatsoever. And I think he began making seventy-five dollars a month. And when he sent out purchasing agents for the WPA or the Relief Administration or whatever it was, he had to lend a number of those people ten dollars so they could get started and get on the road, out of his seventy-five. M.F.: He would lend money to purchasing agents to go out into the state and start... MacDougall:  Well, he did to begin with, 'til they got their first checks. He actually lent about seventy-*five dollars, which was a lot for us. M.F.: What exactly was he doing when the program first started? What was he hired to do? MacDougall: To put people to work, to think up projects.  I read in one place where he had to put seventy thousand men to work within a week. So necessarily, all of the work wasn't useful, it depended largely on how creative the local people were, seeing what needed doing. M.F.: Was he travelling throughout the state? MacDougall: Yes, he travelled throughout the state, and he knew Georgia like a book. There are so few cities. He always spoke of Towns County, Toombs County; he never spoke of the town, because it wasn't big enough. The towns were all about like Plains, Georgia. M.F.:  [laughter] What did he think of the federal program 71 when he first started working with it? Was he real enthusiastic? MacDougall:  He was fascinated with it, and he really believed in it. You see, the Emergency Relief Administration was really founded because Iekes' public works program was not getting enough done.  The money wasn't trickling down as fast as it should.  Therefore, Roosevelt felt that it was absolutely necessary to get money right away into the hands of the people, where they would have some spending power. [Interruption in tape] M.F.: When Bob first started working for the WPA, then, in Georgia, a woman was the head of the program. MacDougall: Right. M.F.:  How did he feel about that, about working under a woman? MacDougall: He absolutely loved her, and I felt she had a great influence on him. Because not only his family believed in absolute honesty, but Miss Shepperson was brought up the same way, and no one would have made her do a crooked thing. M.F.: Was that a problem with the WPA at the time in Georgia... MacDougall: No. M.F.: Not in Georgia, but in other states it was a problem. MacDougall:  It was, until.... You see, Governor Gene Talmadge appointed, I think, five men or thnee men to be overseers or commissioners, and Gay was working under them. Well, Bob was the one who appointed the fourteen purchasing agents, and Talmadge wanted to appoint them and put in political people. And that's the time when 72 Roosevelt took the power out of the hands of the states and the work was directly under the federal government. M.F.: So they didn't have to answer to anyone in state government at all. MacDougall:  No. Absolutely nobody. M.F.: And Bob was in favor of setting it up that way, wasn't he? MacDougall:  Yes, he certainly was, because he wasn't about to let Gene.... Oh, and they did everything to get rid of him and Gay. I have a piece here that Ellis Arnall, who afterwards was such a liberal governor, was Talmadge's floor leader, and he got up on the floor of the House and said that the people who were running the Relief Administration were carpetbaggers. And Gay Sheppersonher name was Gay Boiling Sheppersonrwas of the FFV's of Virginia, and Bob's people, some of them still lived in Georgia on the original land grants from the King of England. And his great-great-great grandfather or something sold the City of East Point for a dollar an acre.  So they were by no means carpetbaggers. And one of them was Miss Fitzsimons from Charleston, South Carolina, a WPA worker. She lived with Gay Shepperson, and they were just like Siamese twins. M.F.: But that didn't have any real effect.  That was just sort of noise that was... MacDougall:  It had a big effect because you didn't have to please these people. M.F.: No, I mean when they tried to get them out, they didn't come enywhere near succeeding. MacDougall:  Oh, no, no, they didn't succeed.  Roosevelt and 73 Harry Hopkins just took that thing right out from under the states and put it in the hands of the federal government. M.F.: This sort of goes into a question that I had about the relationship of the work that Bob and Gay Shepperson were doing with the WPA, and the power structure in the state and also in the city of Atlanta. Did the state government and the city government try to influence the WPA or try to get them to buy from certain people or to try to get them to set.... They were setting up a tremendous number of projects, and thirteen or fourteen million dollars was involved a year in the kind of work that they were doing. Wasn't there a lot of pressure on them to, say, buy materials from certain people or hire certain people? ' MacDougall:  I don't know as there was so much of that, but I do remember the gifts we sent back and the influence that people tried to get...for instance, I can remember there was a man here, the president of a bank. Miss Shepperson had lived here for a number of years, and after she became head of the WPA he and his wife, one Sunday afternoon, came calling, and she said he had on a top hat.  See, he wanted to get on the good side of her, and he wanted to know her. And then people would send you Christmas presents.  It used to make Bob absolutely furious, and he said that if he was going to be bought off he wasn't going to be bought off with a pot plant. M.F.:  [laughter]  It was real unusual, wasn't it, for a woman to be in that high a position? MacDougall: Yes, it really was. M.F.: Did you ever talk to her about the pressure on her, or did she seem to have trouble filling that kind of role? 74 MacDougall: No not at all. She had been, I think, head of maybe social work in the government. Anyway, she had worked under Harry Hopkins in some kind of social work, and she was used to being an adminsitrator. M.F.:  So there wasn't any talk about her inability to fill her job. MacDougall:  Oh, absolutely not, no.  Everybody really had confidence in her. But when you talk about the power structure in Georgia, what you find isat that time, and I'm sure it's true now to an extentthat the bankers, for instance, would want to be in good with Talmadge.  In fact, the law firm that is now, so many of Jimmy Carter's people have come from that law firm, very prestigious, it was alleged that they had a line from there to' the legislature, to the governor's office.  So they wanted to do what the governor wanted them to do so that they could get the laws passed to benefit their businesses. M.F.: What had Bob done with his business when he went into this? Had it just completely folded or stopped? MacDougall: Oh, no. He actually meant to do it temporarily, because his mother really needed the money, so he came down.  I think one of his cousins was already in it, and he got in there with him. And then it enabled him to make a living, and it enabled her to have a good bit of money.  It didn't go into bankruptcy. He had to let the men go when he couldn't pay them; he just had to go out of business. M.F.: It just stopped. MacDougall: Yes. Because he tried as hard as he could 'til the last minute to give them whatever money he could make. M.F.:  So Bob worked with the WPA from 1933 until 1938 in 75 different forms. We were talking about the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and the Civil Works Administration, and then finally the WPA. MacDougall: Now wait a minute. He worked for it until it actually folded. M.F.: Right. But then in '38 he went with the Atlanta Housing Authority. MacDougall: Briefly. Just for a year. M.F.: But I want to back up for a minute and go back to 1928, and we were talking about Bob's business and what he was doing during that period. And I wanted to talk about what you were doing during that period. You had moved to Atlanta, and where were you living? MacDougall:  I lived on Tenth Street opposite Piedmont Park, which is now where the section called the Strip is. M.F.: The Height-Ashbury of Atlanta for a while there, too. MacDougall:  Yes.  And I had visited an architect's daughter who lived on that same street, and they lived next door to Mr. and Mrs. J.P. Stevens.  In fact they had a common driveway. And Mr. Edwards, the architect, had designed the Stevens' house. M.F.: This is the Stevens of the engraving company? MacDougall: Engraving Company.  So I when I came to Atlanta after our honeymoonI can remember I was absolutely in tears. We went to the Georgian Terrace and we couldn't afford to stay there very long. And I went to one of my friends' houses and said, "Oh, I'm looking for an apartment, and I've never been in but one apartment and that's Joe Tail's in the Ponce de Leon Apartments, and I know 76 we couldn't afford that." So she said, "Well, you can stay here if you want to and just pay my cook and let my husband stay there in my my house (that was on Eleventh Street) until you can find an apartment." And that's what we did. Because she went to the mountains every summer, and he still laughs at the way I used to burn the toast. M.F.:  [laughter] MacDougall:  But then what I really did, when I found this apartment on Tenth Street, I was familiar with that area and I read all the time and studied cooking.  And I'd go to the Agnes Scott Club.  And I would go with my cousins up to the Tulls' on weekends sometime, and I'd go to my cousin Waddy Thompson's, the historian, and have meals. There was no real productive life, except I had time to read. M.F.: Was Bob travelling a lot during this time, down to his home county? MacDougall: No, not at all. His timber was in what was old Campbell County, which is now a part of Fulton County, so it was very close.  Only the roads were muddy.  You could go out there, and you'd get stuck in the mud. And now, of course, it's all industrial. M.F.: You had mentioned that a lot of your family was sick during this time and you were having to take care of them. And 2 did you do a lot of travelling back and forth to South Carolina? I took an active interest in North Avenue Presbyterian Church. We also played bridge. I coached students. 2 That was actually a little later. 77 MacDougall: My mother had a serious heart attack in 1934, and I had to go up there at least once a month. And finally the head of the Seaboard Railway...Dad asked him could I have a pass, because the minute I started teaching I had to give up my pass to ride free on the railway. But that I was coming up there on his /                                    business to look after Mother, so I did go up about once a month I                                    and check on her. Then, say, Bob's uncle at one time was ill for months with cancer, and his wife and her sister stayed at our house i !                                    and Bob or I took them to Piedmont Hospital and brought them home j i                                     from Piedmont Hospital. Ed MacDougall, Bob's youngest brother, I                                    had pleurisy, and he was living in Atlanta at the time with some type 1                                    of job, or maybe going to school, and so I looked after him when he was |                                    sick. I                                               M.F.: And then you taught school for a little while? MacDougall: Yes, and during that same period I taught school. [Interruption] M.F.: So you started teaching school to earn some extra money? MacDougall: No, I taught school because I had been playing bridge with a girl named Elmer Harwell and she called me up one day and said, I                                     "I'm getting my M.A. at Emory, aid I've been teaching at this little French private school, and now I can't teach there because it interferes with my schedule, getting my M.A. All Mademoiselle Groleau wants is someone who has a college degree. How about your doing it? You haven't got anything to do." And I said I'd be delighted.  So I just took the job. I had five students. 78 M.F.: Did you like doing that? MacDougall:  I adored it.  I said, "Why, I never have taught first grade," and Elmer said, "Well, Mademoiselle will show you how to teach first grade." So she did, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. And then the next year I was anxious to go back, because by that time I needed the money. But then she didn't have the money to pay me either, so I couldn't teach any more.                                                               ...... M.F.: What did you think of your life during this time? Did you really enjoy what you were doing? Were you sort of at ease with it? You'd been running around quite a bit all the years before you married.  Or did you begin to sort of chafe at playing bridge and teaching a little bit of school and want to do something that was more productive or more...
