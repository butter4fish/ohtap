What led you to become Involved in the interracial movement?/ Well, I want to go back just a little bit.     .I'm a native of East Texas and it Is the old part of Texas, the slavery area. There was a town not very far fro$ where I was born and lived called Tyler, Texas.      .My parents raised me very carefully. I couldn't use my fingers at the table when I ate and so I had a very light appetite until they all dismissed.    The family went in the front room and I went in the kitchen,    our yard man and our cook had a chair that had a box on it and I got on that and ate between themwith my fingers,    of course, I didn't ask questions.    I found out very early that if I didn't say anything the grown people forgot there were little  ears present ana i oouia learn aiot.      .So I learned rrom them (it was never mentioned in the family)^ there had been a perfectly horrible lyndhing in Tyler.      .The reason I remember it so keenly was because they kept on speaking.     .about burning the Negro's eyes out.      .And it just bothered me so much.. .   .That was my first knowing anything about this because.   .   .race was never IP mentioned among white people," My best friend was a Negro girl about two years older than I and was the daughter of the cook. She came and we jarit played together and all of that.    Of course she never went into xhe house but I didn't realize that.       x* When we'd play in the back yard I'd be called in the house and she'd stay in the  back yard.    It was one of those things, you see,that warn done and not xsxx until I was very much older (This lynching took place when I was about 6 years old.    That was about 1888 or 1889.    It wasn't very long after Reconstruction.) So I went along.I wasnt very interested in race at all.    I 2 didn't see any segregation or discrimination or anything else. We had a public  school for two months, then the parents that were able to pay went on for tAf more months.   .   . A long time afterwards,  I moved to Georgetown Texas.    This was the center of Texas Methodism.    The university was there. There was no business or anything else.    Everybody there was serving the university in some way.   .   .1 was out of town attending an annual meeting of the federation of Women's jxLubs when the telephone rang to come home.    I got a train out at two o'clock in the morning.    I got home and found my 5 year old daughter had polio.   .   .Then I began to think; She hadn't been exposed-It was November.    Very seldom do you have polio in winter.    And this shov;c v:hat a noble disposition I hadI wasn't interested in race  until someone suggested i to me that it probably came through the  servants that we had.   .   .1 got to thinking about it and then I became interested in the schools.    That was the time-that Rosenwald/schools ^were being built/.    The local school had to put up the land and it all had to be the property of the school board.   .   .and they all had to have a number of rooms according to the number of pupils they had and the lighting had to be  just right.   .   .Rosenwald put up 2/3 of the money.    So the The itegro aahuul wao boing hold in the church. Negroes had to bu the land.   .   .This was about  1920.   .   .Negroes hardly had any schools.    Sj36 a meeting was going to be held in the church.    The county superintendent was a very close friend of mine.    It was the first time we'd ever had a woman in the job*    She asked me to go with her.   .   .SaaicxJdacxMBgxaxjticiBljaEX.   . They began to talk about what they wanted.    And this was the thing that just simply made meI was being called by the Lord 3 then and didn't know itI had to get busy. What those Negroes wanted was exactly what we ac wanted for out children. . .They wanted their children to have the same kind of education. They had to buy this school; they had to raise this money.  .Bamamk They asked for everyone to come forward and make a contribution. We drove back to Georgetown and I talked to Mary Shipp. . .1 had to get to work, something had to be done about the way Negroes were treated. . .1 got my daughter Mary who was then about 11 and a Girl Sc^out.^I got the wife of the principal give of the Negro school to^fcoaoh her kszxta cooking lessons. Then I went to see the school. I would say that in any wind that blew, that building would have blown down. I'd never seen it took it for granted, you know* Then I began to move to get them a new school building. We were going to tear down the old court house. . .So when they were going to tear that down I talked to the members of the school board. . .So they decided it could be hauled. . .And the Negroes built it and it was a beautiful building.  .Gradually the Negro town and the white town became sort of interwoven. Before the Negroes worked for  us but what they did when they left was the^e business. The school principal. . .was telling me about a group of white boys. . .When those white boys went by his,house and he was therewith his wife, he was frightened, because he knew if they came in.  .he had no protection. If they wanted to take his wife off there was nothing he could do. He was completely helpless. Xtax That was a side I had never thought ofr They couldn't protect their women* That was another thing that 4 / I never forgot. . . /Did anybody object to your activities in Georgetown?/ Oh, many of them did!    But you see Itjiappened to be they couldn't do anything to me and I'll tell you why,-xxx%sz very mercenary.    My mother and I owned the telephone company and 3 or 4 telephone plants out in the county.    That was a monopoly. N .  .At the time we didn't have any votes you know.    They could vote to have our streets paved.   .   .If we didn't have any men in the family they could vote anything they wanted to on us.   a i 5 / Then we organized the Texas Interracial Commission.    The 0re%dent of the University of Texas was the chairman.    Mrs. /Luke/ Johnson who was the Director of Woman's Work /for the Commission on Interracial Cooperation/ came over to organize the women.    We had a ha4^T secretary paid by the Commission to organize the men.    This was in 1920.    When they decided to select me for the chairman of the women's work my activities in politics I thought would be a handicap.    I was chairman of the state federation/of women's clubs}-that made me respectable.       .The Commission was putting up all the expenses to come to these meetings.      .1 suppose I was sort of born to be independent. I thought we ought to be able to pay our own expenses.   .   .So v;o voted to havo duss and the money was  to be  used to pay uiie expenses of the annual meeting.   .   .It made them very much more independent. xx.We made our program without any respect to the Commission because sm they didn't know what Texas needed  (Texas doesn't either nowJ)A of course Atlanta paid my salary.    I felt wicked taking a salary because of the telephone business and all that but Ite wasn't cheap.    I meah I was appreciated.    At any rate I was made chairman.    And at the end of the second year we didn't have but one committeethe men and women met is&amp;x together I went up to Oklahomathey had a terrible lynching there and I investigated it.    They had one in Arkansas.   .  .It was pretty bad therethat was the Southwestern front^/r.    Thjfc was how I got iJaaefcwbaat in and when I got started I got deeper and deeper and deeper in because there were so many things that ought not to be.    We could talk like this in little circles if we wanted to but we ha&amp; to get enough*^of the people behind us and 6 / that was what we set out to do. . . iax We organized a movement against lynching in Texas. . * The farther away the lynchings were from a town that had a daily paper, the more the daily paper would condemn it but if it was JLajlxJikxjezz anywhere within the trading area of the paper there was nothing in it. That applied to the Dallas News. But eventually the owner of the Dallas News was one of my strongest supporters. . .Every lynching we had in Texas. . .1 would go and investigate. . .The annual conferences of the Methodist church met in Texas. . .1 got hold of the BishopsBishop Moore that later came to Atlanta. He was a beautiful speaker. . .1 wanted to be permitted to speak to the whole conference^'when the report /of th Committee on Christian Social RslationoJ "&amp;= given. . .1 was a A&amp;th&amp;dist. So I spoke and I would tell the story of one lynching that had happened within the Conferences area. . (Then the next Bishop HayEast Texas, axkaoc Bishop Bennentwouldn't go in when the churches unified. Wouldn't let her speakJ^ I was speaking to the preacher* who ought to have this on their conscience. . .So gradually when I went to I could go see him. the towns where one of these preachers was a pastor^ So if there was a lynching there I could go talk to him and get his side of it* Most of them were truthful because they weren't going to be #" quoted* Them the last lynching was down in Beaumont.  .right outside of Beaumont where oil was struck. I went. And when the Interracial Commission held its annual meeting &amp;lt;hore Dr. Alexander asked me to tell that story* what happened,*a the response of the white people, and the fact that there had been no publicity 7 .' other than the terrible story about  this Negro attempting to attack this white womanwhich wasn't so.   .  .Mrs.  Johnson was very indignant because    I had been the star for a minute or two.  She was the first one that had Woman's Work.    1 She had resigned several times but Dr. Alexander would never take her resignation.mat She would always cry because she knew that was one thing /men couldn't stand/.    Evidently xx that settled her husband whenever she wanted anything.    So she went back to the hotel and she went down to the office and she resigned and he accepted her resignation.    Then they had to get another woman. That was Mrs. Hendersonshe stayed on it for two years*..it waTrrfcBTttwgTXfrsTtTartaTr That was in 1927. 8 Then it was in 1930 when they had that big lynching in Sherman, Texas when the Quadrinneal Conference of the Methodist is Church was in session there in Dallas and Sherman wax only about 30 miles north of Dallas. And it was a horrible lynching. It was one of the worst we ever put oil. I won't go into details on that. They say brutalizing of the Negroit was the brutalizing It was in broad daylight. of the lynchers. . .of course, all of these brethren of the Methodist Church. . .from all over the South.(we.didn't go North, course we weren't wanted, it was mutual)* So Alexander appointed a committee. Mrs. Henderson resigned and the committee insisted I take the Director of the Women's Work and I came over in June of '29. I had stayed for the Democratic Convention whach was because this  lynching happened so near the Conference,  .   .When he came back he decided they were going to do re search- -jfetaci kxax Arthur Raper (supposed to be sec. of    eorgia but he wasn't    ' much of a secretary but that wasn 't his fault.    If you're given a job that yonrenot adapted to you can't do a good job.     .) We had a very talkative woman on the Council of the Methodist Women so when this Commission was set up and the editor of the Chattanooga Times accepted the chairmanship of it and they appointed professors, etc..  .So when the Commission was announced there was no woman on it.    So Mrs.^Downs.   .   .was insulted.   .   She read the riot act about^to Dr. Alexander.    And DR.    Alexander the only way he could handle a woman was to get up and leave the room.    She was over in Nashville*. She had* spoken to him.    Then she followed it up with a latter.    So he got up and left the room and came into my office and he wanted sympathy.    And what I told him was I didn't think he ought to have a woman on that committee because what women would have any influence on a commission made up of 8 or 10.   .  .prominent men?   He was very comforted but he didn't know what was going to happen next. So I said if you will underwrite the expenses*, I'll call a meeting here in Atlanta xza of representative women from all of the Southern states  (11we aisfac included those that the Confederacy counted but never left the union).    We'd have a meeting here 6s women and see what we could do with    this field, Well, I don't think if he hadn't been so battered by Mrs. Downs that he would have immediately acquiesced to my request,  but ta did*    And then we had the meeting.    TttHrfrTftanftxttiiexggaootxxg.       "in svory one of the  churches there %as  .   .   .a committee that deals with something like "Chiistian social relations" and things ... like that that this thing would be in.    We asked the chairmen /these/ that made up.xfca programs for the whole Southern area to come. 4                                                                      OKla.., La., Ark.,3^ We had about 17 women that came.    We didn't get /thKxftghhlnwwwLrigg^j *-Tex. because that was across the river and it was so hard to get rtnrtgsrjf But I was to go over there and hold see a meeting of here.                                                                                                            , those f our, zxaxaax* present the same thing, have the same resolution and get them to sign it-whioh I did..Mr. Eleazer drew up 1P1X was that resolution and it was a good one.  .   .xxAa result of my getting Dr. Alexander to underwrite #1000 for all of these conventions,  that made Mr. Kind hit the ceiling.    He was the representative of ne 5 #CA*    When the TmA closed xts -&amp;lt;*r work-,and they had put on a drive just beforeall the money they had they had turned in to this movement in the South. Mr. Kind was treasurer and also he was one of the big boys in the YlfCA.    He was perfectly furious.    He was a South Carolinian and should have been a gentleman.    But he s%fd some very rough 10 i things to me. I told Mi that Dr. Alexander was the one that appropriated the money. "But he never would have done it if you hadn't ask him ode to." Well, that was true. Then we had to have a budget after that. Mr. King made out the budget. He had assigned so much for women's work and how much was to be spent for each thing. Well, it was alii ght-pthe total. But I was against the a^otment because he would assign something and it couldn't be moved. If I didn't spend it all for that particular thing it couldn't be spent. W^ll I raised an objection. I sjbE said I thought the purpose was not to go xax beyond the total and if I didn't go beyond the total then I was living within the budget. Mr. King was voted down and I had the total +. hendlA pq T nlemeed,  And that was the reaann I could finance the anti-lynching affair. Because there was nothing in that budget for our movement.  .although we had just had our meeting to get the movement started. I think. . .what I allowed for literature including postage was $150for the whole year and for the whole program. It may have been more than that. . . There were a couple of Negro women at our next annual meeting when I was asked to report and one of the Negro men. .  it might have been Forrester Washington.  .said we ought not to have a white woman's movement financed by the Interracial JiJ Commission which^not have Negro women in it. It should be int.arroial9 , -And I said  ^a do not have Negro women on it but I consider lynching interracial." It was always t&amp;e Negro that got lynched by white people so it certainly was interracial. Sometimes the Lord gives us the right thing to say at the right time. . .also the wrong thing to say at the right time. At aa // .* any rate that is the background of it. Eventually this thing got all over the United States and even in Europe because there were letters in my files which came from Europe.  .    Now the first thing we did.   .   .oh,all the women didn't sign that resolution,  they had to get their organization's approval,  but none of the church women failed.   .   .When we got signatures our aists represented various churches.    And the Baptists don't sign Methodists lists and the Meth.  don't sign (?) Baptist lists.   .   .so that's the way we kept the fool thing straight.    And when we said we had 44,000 signatures, there was no signature that was a duplicate.    We had the PTA,  the Federa- tion.  of Women's Clubs.   the WCTU,    But.  those  ant in Inn didn't  have committees on Christian social relations, there was no place to fit this in their program.    xxm So if we got any PSA woman to sign,  she signed as a Baptist, or a Methodist,  or a Congregation- &amp;lt; alist or something like that.   .   .The YWCA signed it,  but it was    . a national organization.o.   .But these churches were exclusively Southern. He The YWCA endorsed ^kka federal anti-lynching xagxza3%x bill and we did notfor reasons. Shsxtha The head of the YWCA for the South was very active withxm us because she was a staunch Presbyterian. The poor thing was pulled between being a Pres. and YWCA. But we would not endorse a federal anti-lynching bill. . . This was the mechanics of it: The chairman of the C.S.R. a$  Committee for the Methodist Church lived in N.C. was a very close *+* friend of mine. She was in the organizational *e n I meeting*    She was to write to the Christian Social Relations chairmen in all of the conferences telling them about this organization and what it meant and to get a speaker to present the cause.    You see ww were out of it as far    as any publicity was concerned.    They were never asked to endorse the Association.   . . So they had the backing of their  church.    And the Baptist women did exactly the same thing, and the Episcopal women and the Congregational*    Trtrarot- You know the Episcopalians are a little snooty.    We had a little difficulty with them because they had never separated and so they didn't k need to come into this thing. That was why Mrs. Martin was chosen as Chairman of this thing becuase she was an Episcopalian and we wanted to get the Episcopal women in.    of course we had the Jewish women.   .  .And,my dear,in La. we got the  secular org.  of tne guar uatuolics   (the Bishop let them join).    We got them in La.    and that was very necessary the  southern area because down in &amp;a.  if you  couldn't get the Catholics lined . up,  you weren't lined up.   (I know a great deal about La.    x My ... husband was a native of New Orleans.)    They would write to Mrs. Newellshe was the head woman of the nhn-rah,-xTkmy%u*.;q)4 and ask her who to ask.    She would tell them to ask me,  but I was to go as a Methodist.    And I spoke so wellthis is an aside the one thing I learned if you're going to talk to another org. you've got to know their language,  you've got to know what they calls their organization,  their committees*  etc.    And I did it so successfully that the Presbyterians all took me for a Pres. And that isn't deceitful.    You wouldn't go to a foreign country and if you knew their language not use it. Now this is what we did next.    I prepared two statejfments- mimeographed.    zxmm*m&amp;zk#*mmx.  .  .to be signed because in the %f/J .' first place we wanted a mailing list and in the next place we wanted to know people we could call on when a lynching threatened.    ao &amp;t this first meetingI think I would have been an awfully good rabble rouser because I'm able to move my audience.    I would present it and I would tell them what a handicap 85$ of our foreign missionaries went ^to non-white peoples and the effect that had on them when we had a lynching here and it was carried in the world wide press.   .   .These missionaries had to make their way,  they weren't popular.    0&amp;e missionary returned about 4 years later*this was the effect of it.    she waid one morning she was in India. She got out and saw the paper and it headlined a lynching in the United States* And her converts,   .   ,how did she explain.   .   -a Christian nation that did that.    And she.^.   .told them church people did not lynch-^course she didn't inow this wasnit true..   .There wouldn't have been a lynching if the church people didn't do it.    Every- belonged to some body^wQp in ojmo church.    .WhklKXKhKA'w%ax&amp;Mxk%KxhBMk%a3%agx #Tm*xkhaxBMljrxf)lKRMx@Kxii&amp;wa   Well, you know that moved all the women because they were putting up so much money and they believed in their foreign missions,  they were dedicated.    And here this thing was happening in this country that was a handicap to the thing they were dedicated to.      .AniyttaftJ.x tfri*  n *\     **,-4*     4- k a      ci + T^wr-. n+-      r\ T\ y, A-a   .  en     rata ul.

And then they signed this. . .All of the churches ha*; three sections. They have the overhead body, then they have the intermediate body that takes in maybe a couple of counties, WW ' 1 and then they have the local churches. We got out threeone for the overhead body and the women signed that and pledged themselves to go back home and work with the district chairmen Then we had a resolution that the district chairmen could sign... Then the district chairmen pledged themselves to take it out to their local churches and they did. Then we had something for them to sign. . .The Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lyncting was never mentioned, neither in these resolutions nor when I made a speech. Because I wasn't asking them to endorse our ga&amp;aXkhxgax org. I was asking them to go to work on this thing that was dreadful in this country. Then we decided that the next step was the officers of the law. And Lhey were tocVejcyoiic of tuemmm*  g uxxS Signature* of their sheriffs. Now the only people that could get the signatures of the cqa&amp;ty officials were the people that voted. . .it was the local community in a countyand the women , voted then, we were voters thenand the sheriffs were interestingly compliant. There were two women that were acting sheriffs that prevented lynchings themselves.0 one was in Tenn,and the other was in Miss. . . .The one in Tenn. at stood in the door of the jail. If she he^d been a man they would have simply forced her aside* That was a little bit of chivalry. I wish all the women had been sheriffs uiou* Then we got the state police involved. When a lynching threatened if they could get the sheriff to phone thegooc governor to send the state? police to move the prisoner (in the case of Miss, it was up in Jackson where they really had a bastille there) . . .Then the sheriff would open the doors of the jail and just uf/s- ! let the mob go through and see that the prisoner wasn't there. And they all reported these things,  you see,  I had reports on S them. We had this mailing list.    It was all card indexedfirst the states and then the counties, then by local communities. We got 15,000 xkaxtxxxxtsxxxgH signatures of sheriffs.   .   . that they would exert every single means they had to prevent a lynching in their county.  .    Always the woman thrat wao  therSoaflr^f tho lucalgruup was an_j.nf luontlal woman-.    %hen we got the Associated Press behind us.    There was a double lynching in California.   .   .and Julia Collier Harris came to me and asked me to telegraph the governor.*^ Up uatx until then we had not gone out nf the South,   .   .T sent a very strong telegram and it got in the press.    Then when we had our annual meeting of  state  chairmen Mr.  Caldwell ^head of the Associated Press? asked to come.   .  .Our meetings were not open toApress.   .   .but I said he might.      .on condition that he was not to write up the meeting.    When he went back he gave instructions to 11 his men that when any news came over the wire that involved   .a o^ime out of which a lynching might grow that I was to be notified-day or night.            //fas    /. 1/   /f/A*&amp;lt;/J7 The first one came from Mississippi.    When I got hold of our chairman she said why there was nothing in the paper,-tkax I           /' rf         TfTU  TAwsias  capers not nut yst but Its going to be safe Li fcA*V        ilMJ JL AAAJUtt.       uu. a that the mob was forming^and it was.    She got injto a car, had herself driventhis was in that awful county of McComb,.one. and she went to see the sheriff at about 7:00 in the morning  . He summoned the state patrol and they got that Negro out of 24-/6 McComb and up into  Jackson before the mob was well organized.   .   . That was the way the Ass. Press helped. Then the other one was in Tenn.    %e AP phoned me about a lynching that was on the waythe Negro had escaped and the mob was chasing him.    The chairman was not at home but she was in a small town north of Memphis.  .   .1 got hold of her.    She went to work w Immediatelyfunny how a woman could stir up things if she wantedto.    And she kept it so  stirred up.   .   .the mob did everything they could to captaae him but he got over into Arkansas*, and he was out of their reach. Going    back to the signatures.   .   .In Amarilla,  Texas.   ,   . s~  /9JS there were two elderly maiden sisters that had gone to tatac the district meeting of the Methodist Church and they had nad tnis thing presented tfcat for them to sign that they would do everything they could  to prevent lynching*    They had signed it aid gone on home.    And the younger ta sister had been attackedbut not mistreatedby a Negro.    It was the shock of it that put her to bed.    And the mob # formed and they went to this ho&amp;e.    It was up there in the panhandle very,very thinly populated at that time.    And they wanted her to identif^a* the Negro.    Her sister said that her sister would not Identify him even if she knew he was the one because they had signed this  co^mmittmant and they couldn't go against it.    Well the editor of, the Amarilla News of course this was really something, it had never happened befoo__ sent obe of his men out to get the story.    she had some of this literature that had my name on it because I had written it.   .   . He took it back to the editor.    The editor was very much moved by it.    oh inoidentally,he came from Georgia.    You wouldn't think a**/f that anyone who came from Georgia would get religion in Texas* He wrote the story and he sent ityto some monthly magazine" ana' -fifey'" sent it to me in Atlanta because they wanted it confirmedfrthey didn't believe itfthey didn't believe that anything like that was going on k in the South. . .1 read it very carefully and wrote to them that there was nothing in it that was not a fact They printed it. Then I took it and had copies made. . ".That had a tremendous influence. It had in the story of Mrs. ////,'* down here in 8. Georgia that was baking her Christmas cake when ,                                                                            I believe a lynching was threatened in her county. She left her cake in oven because she had to act fast, and she acted fast. Now she was chairman of C.S.R. for the South @*ara4* *V#*~P ~~ ~&amp;gt; had a xa tremendous responsibility. And she went to work on it. I went down to the office and I sat there until about 3:00 % on Christmas day. I phone her and told her I was there. She , phoned. . .about 4:00 o'clock that the Negro had escaped and the mob dissolved because he had gone into another county. . . Her name and address was given in the story. Ztfei+JL***    c*/il&amp;gt;*eJ   A, Now remember we did not get publicity. That was one thing Mr. Caldwell was very firm about. . .never anything got in the story about what the women were doing. Then we got to the place where the state patrol in all of the Southern states had a meeting down in Jacksonville, Fia. And the chairman of the Fla. ASWPL, she was the secretary of the Episcopal bishop down there, was asked to provide a speaker*** to present this whole work, what it meant and how the patrol could help, of course the patrol had to be asked by the sheriff not by a private citizenthat's why we had to get the sheriffs Vt ' 2 i first.      . Well it continued and it kept growing without any publicity. Now you would think that these things are awfully serious and they are.    But there's always a funny haha part of it,  and the funny   haha is the white people*    We had a lynching over in East Texas,    xtxxaisfruBflxaxwhliHxwaawni      I got all the  story from the district judge.  .   .the pastors of the churches, and the editors...   A woman was not involved.    They had a box factory nimble with his hands there and the Negro was very dtaxt,  he could work so much better and more quickly that he had struck for a pay equal to  the white man and they had to get rid of him) .   .Eventually we got all the wx"""              way up story.    I was waiting te^leaveadgggfcx8 in East Texas about 50 miles from Beaumont ^(You see any. Negro that gave any trouble .   .   .might have gotten lynched and always, because he had done something or said something to a white man.    That was the reason we were trying to find out how many times a white woman was protested by a mob.)    There was no place to sleep in that little old town.     .And the sheriff was drunk when I.interviewed him. I remember tne thing I saad    that made him so mad.    He said *There were ladies in that lynching" And I said if they were in that lynching they were not ladies.    That made him furious and that's the reason he reported k me to the grand jury which was in session.    We were over in tne Methodist ministers home, resting before we started back to Beaumont.    And here came this rap rap, rap^on    the gallery and the sheriff appeared at the door. And he said,"Is Jessie Daniel Ames here?"    And I said,   "I'm Jessie Daniel Ames."   Well he was serving a supoena on me to appear at 9:00 o'clock the next morning before the grand jury. uPv? I Of course the two Beaumont women with meI think they ware as scared as I was.    But I know I was as scared as anyone could be because I didn't know*-,  .where I'd sleep or whether I'd sleep.    I suppose it took me about 15 minutes to get my mind together than I got to the telephone and telephoned to the judge.    Now this is where my politics served very well some - pretty times.    I was^well known politically awrxxxsEKxaxsex .    .and the governor right then happened to be from my county.    So I went over tathe judge would see mehe was a lovely, handsome man and so, sympathetic with my situation but I would have to understand that they had the right to summon anybody that they thought had any information about a crime that had been committed. I nad siiown that I did have   information and I told him I had but I said,   "But you see most of it I got from you,   Judge."    He saad,  "Well,  just wait a minute."   He went down to where the grand jury was sitting and he was back up in 15 minutes and told  ?" me that they had made a mistake and I could leave rit away. after**. Well,  it was funny wJaon^E got to Beaumont but I sure wanted to get to Beaumont. You see we had to get facts.    When I would get the xxaxxxx story of a lynching then    I would get back to the office,I would write the  story as I remembered it, never mentioning names, sources.    Then I would send a copy to each one of the women who had been with me to make corrections because you know people remember different things and forget the things that actually happened.    ?hen they would send it back to me.    I never recall that there were any corrections.      .Then I would have them printed, then I would send the women a supply of them to distribute to their organizations.   .                                                     ^ A--*    ^,,cc                     **-* One of the things that was beginning to irritate me terriblyit was during the DepressioUr-and we had a meeting over in Jackson, Miss.    It wasn't anti-lynchingI was doing interracial work on the side.    They got to talking about impudent and imp^e/tinent the Negroes had gotten.    They were going North to work in industry and those that were left behind were getting remittances from their men and some of them were getting them from their soldier sons or husbands.    And they were a littjle independent.    But there were some that had to work.    And those that had to work in domestic  % service were not being paid anything.    They would take home the left-overs from meals now these women were telling this themselves at this meeting and maybe at the end of the week Lhey would give  them a dolliar or a dollar and a half or an old dress they didn't want.    Them it occurred to me we had to investigate domestic service*  .    2#- JU i But 1811 get back to lynching.    I printed a report every month.    It came as a booklet.    I printed all of the lynchings that had occurred during the month and all of the prevented lynchings, whether or not there was any woman involved, what the real crime was.      .It got to the place where sheriffs just automatically prevented a lynching because after all the women voted.  .   .The last one was  "The Changing/character^of Lynching." .  .  .You see the war was on;  transportation was difficult; we may have had cars but we didn't have gasoline.    I had been doing all of this traveling all over the South by air because it was time saving.    Then we had a terrible lynching in Missouri.  1   and I believe 2 or 3 in Ohio.    We were not involved in that HEEanxs out l told the story because X thought 5t woulcl oomf ort us to know that the rest of  the country was lynching from time all to time.    It wasAbelieved to be concentrated in the South.    so the time had oome for  us to close.    Ww had actually reached what I would term our goal.    We had one year when Mississippi didn't have a lynching^he didn't have one for 18 months.    We knew we were saved then*    We didn't have them so often in Texas but we didn't need them so often because m they were so terrible. And so we closed it out then. That's a pretty good summing up of what we did but I want to tell you that I cannot possibly express in any words the dedication of the women in the counties and the small towns. And  they were taking alot.   .  .because what they were doing was not popular but tf*noting except belief.  .  .There was Mrs. /"/ ^&amp;gt; A/To'c/Jof McComb, Miss.    I didn't describe her to herself but I did to some other.    She had no fear became she was wrapped in the arms of the Lord.    They never failed/"' once they had 6/. ^ St 22 gotten the outline of the program. . . during Reconstruction You know the Mass. governor of Miss.^was named Ames  And the Jackson Newswhat it didn't do to meI I got the clippings and there was no way to answer it.  .1 just wrote back to them and I told them that my hasband was third generation from Ireland, he was born and raised in N.O., and his grandfathers family came immediately to N.o. when they landed in New York, and as far as I know they'd never been in Mass. Ind I never heard anymore about it. It was funny to me, dead funny. I think that man has died since* He was an unreconstructed rebel* /why did you call the movement to a close?/ Well I'll tell you, there were really practical reasons for it. You see the women then began to be very much engaged in war work. . .transportation was hard. I know I got dumped. from an airplane twice. . .everything was rationed, paper, getting things out. . .we couldn't carry on.. We had reduced the number of lynching, one year I think we got through without a lynching. Oh I didn't tell this storyit happened in Georgia. The -for    vS NAACP had absolutely no use^t*-use?"because they were after federal /"legislation/ and we were not*    We were not because if we came out for a federal amendment the doors would be closed to us in the South.    We saxxst wouldn't be invited to soeak because we were following the Yankees.    So it seemed so much better to stop when the women's minds were being distracted their sons, their husbands, their brothers were overseas or were going to be overseas.    so I tfcok it up with the women and 8iPjJ i they agreed that our educational program had been successful* You know lynchings never did come back.  *  .we my kill them some other way but we don't lynch them/".   .1 think I gave in that book lynchings preventedwe didn't take credit for all the lynchings zsmmizzaa preventedbut it showed that there was a changing attitude  toward lynching.    More and more lynchings were prevented than were accomplished.    It covered from 1930 to 1942you see we worked 12 years on it, we worked pretty hard. This lynching that happened down in Georgia.   .   .the NAACP.had reported to Tuskegee that this lynching took place.   .. The Negro had been taken from a train o . . .My son Frederick was two years in the Pacific, a pediatrician in Houston, and he died of cancer in 1959 at the age of 52. My daughter Mary a graduated from Agnes Scott, took her medical degree^Galveston, Texas which was the medical school of the University of Texas, interned at that awful hospital in Texas, charity hospital, then was taken to Detroit on the staff of the pediatric hospital. Then she was asked and went to Bellevue in New York and had charge of the pediatric ward there. Then they asked her to come back to Detroit. They had said they would make her the head of pediatrics.the But when she got there theycfidn't do it so she left, came back to Pennsylvania, went into private practice there, built up an awfully good practice and Lhen later on married a very fjJis gastroe/T&amp;/",^?'J7@^ internal medicine.

Then my daughter s &amp;gt; Lulu had polio before she was.s4*k; course she's on crutches and always will be. She had about 10 or 12 operations. She graduated from highschool here in Decatur, then went on to Agnes Scott. She graduated from Agnes Scott, then went on back to Texas, took a graduate course in journalism. She had already edited the Farm legal Sheet for 2 years. . .Then she went out on her own, she bought out the man she "was working for__course she had some help from meand she's most successfal on financially.    And I'll tell you right now being ^crutches is not a handicapeither for her or for me.        .And she is up Cjefs  7X*T t&amp;gt;#*    Atr f* dm*7~A er J to here in the Methodist church.^   .then she  is up to here in &amp;lt;^/.^V 2&amp;-2S i politicsshe gets that from hermg mother. . .She is not married.

We're a long-lived family. My husbandall of his records and files are at the University of Tulane because he was the yellow-fever specialist^ And during the last epidemic in New Orleans which was 1905, he was in the army then and he was transferred to Jackcon Barracks in Nev; Orleans. Ths+r purpose then was t-c eliminate yellow fever before frost because frost killed the mosquitoes or at least sent them to hibernate. He was'put on as an advisor to the city health department and the fed. health department was in there. The officers ih Jackson Barracks wanted to do what they always had, which was to go up into the mountains o and escape. My husband ruled against it. And Col. Moss who was the head of military service in that whole districtmilitary headquarters in San Antoniosupported Roger. And they stayed there- Of course he wasn't well liked^"because of that by the officers. And they did not have one case of yellow fever in Jackson Barracks. The last case of yellow fever was 4 veek= before frost and his aunt Maryan unreconstructed rebel, at she'd never taken one. that time she didn't think women had to take the vow of religion^" You see the water system in New Orleans was an above ground .0, . . there was no water system. So the fed. govt, ordered all tanks 29-26 i to be screened with 18 inch screening.    Then they went around and investigated and they could have absolutely no water standing anywhere  in the house.    So they could not keep flowers in the house and when the fed.  investigators would come along they'd look in every basement and everything else.    Whatever bottle they threw out they had to break it so water wouldn't gather in it because the yellow fever mosquito never traveled more than 3 or 400 feet from where they bred and they were night mosquitoes+rthey were never out in the daytime.    I love to hear my aunt Mary tell about it.     oh,  incidently* we had been married three weeks when I was sent home to mamma because there wasn't any place for me when he was doing s things like that!    You know it's right hard to be a widow and still have a husband. That was my situation.    That is really briefly my history and the history of my children and my husband.    He died of black water fever in .  .   .in Gruadamala,  that's where the United Fruit Co. had a hospital.    I was out in East Texas and my last child was born two months aftax later.    But none of them went to o                      hy reform school.    I was promised that^my best friends in my home town*    3 wasn't raising them right.    But they missed the reform school.    It was really awfully funny.    They would come to me, you know, and they wamxd were so distressed*    My mother was there but then she lived in another house.    They were so distressed because they ought to have a mother, and t was out after the vote*    Ladies didn't do that* f/. TTT Continued story of lynching reported by NAACp in New Brunswidfc, Ga.

Now I'm not speaking lightly of that because you have no idea.  .   .For four years I was chairman of Christian Social Relation* for the Western North Carolina ConferenceI was retiring.    And they had to send me reports of what they did in Christian Social Relations and up in the mountains in N.C.  the report that month came from a little mountain town and they had to get a new roof,   they called it a new cover, for the church because it was leaking.    And they had fad the lions ail that month and they had raised the money-fed the lionsl    mp.1, I was so tickled.

We got that, right there,    &amp; I felt a little delicate because it was the first time I wanted to interview the mournersbut they weren't mourning.    They were very poor.

And she said, "The people were so thick here, there were so many cars here, you could just step from one car top to another and never touch the ground. And it was the first time they had been important-even temporarily. And there was absolutely no griefI    of course, it was the most dramatic thing that had ever happened.

You see, we used the vote then.      . I impressed upon them that the only people who could get the sheriffs signatures were the people that voted in his county.   .    The women did not have much knowledge of politics.   .   .It didn't occur to them to say,ma "We aren't going to vote for you if you don't sign this thing." I'll tell you what I did.    Sometimes when I'm very tired I don't care what I say.    Then sometimes when I'm very mad I'm definitely going to  say something.    Well,  I raised the question at one of our annual meetings of the Interracial maa Commission on the Negro Kotejrthat the Negro should have the vote,  that the mental body.    But they knew,   say the City Council,   that they weren't going to vote against the City Council if they didn't do something for the Negro.    And we were always representing the Negrothe white people.    I made this speech at a meeting.    la was either pretty tired or pretty mad or both at the same time. I said that among other things that the  self-respect of  tie Negr* was involved ih that, thing.    They were being represented by white men and white women and we never push the other fellow's cause. And it was never taken up.    Segregation and voting for the Negros was never taken up.    They didn't deal too harshly because fortunately for ie and aafortaoatel* for I6ea the Negroes stood by tye.    They naturally would,you know,even if they hadn't liked me personally, which they might not have.    At least I wteai was standing for something that they knew they ought to have.

The first one was that every anti-lynching bill was going to be defeats It ICbey^would pass the House but the S. Senators who headed up the imp. committeesand Tom Cgnnaly fro&amp; Texas was one of them,  he was For. Affairs chairman.   We co ldn't prove it but it seemed so evident that there was an understanding between the House and the Senate.    Now you see,the House comes up for reelection every two years and the Senate every four years so it was safer jhrcrnnr in the future for their electior for the Senate to defeat it than for the House.    There were so many House members who didn't come from the House and they weren't all as stationed as the S. Senators were.    So we couldn't have advanced that. 1P. "You see, what made the Soutnern wnite woman wars was dedication to foreign missions.     I couldn't possibly string in the Senate of the United States and foreign missions though they might need it.   .   . And the women were not political,    only two states in the South ratified the federal suffrageNorth Carolina, Ark.  and Texas did it. You see they weren't politically minded.    And then I don't believe we could have gotten all those women.   .   .if we had endorsed a fed. antilynchlng bill in the beginning.    And I don't believe they would have gone along later on because you see what they were doing wa; working for the things that they believed in and they believed in foreign missions and this thing was hurting them.      . The Interracial Commission never supported federal antilynchlng legislation.    j%rong/ Wka/Was there any carry-over from the foreign mission idea-once they got into the anti-lynching thing did they began to  see things like the domestic service?/ No.    I never crossed programs.    The most fascinating reports on domestic  service.    But we were going to use those as pcx a basis for a report to the women that employed them.    But that was  just at the beginning of the end of  the Interracial Commission.    And I  just had internal warning that I didn't think I was going on officially with the new organization.    I never crossed lines.    Now I'm a saying this and its not derogatory of women:    All women cannot work on two things and keep them separate.    They work in together.    And having been a woman myself I was fairly sure that the safest thing was when we were on anti-lynching we didn't touch anything else.

She had gotten to the p1oft~asr| this v.'ss so off her stylo  where when  she would go to investigate a lynching she wouldn't tell her husband where she was  going because she was against it.    But she ed belonged to that age where you mind^your husband and if he didnjt know what you were going to do he.  .  .She was an unusual person. Mrs.  J. %aa Lomar.   .   .The thing that astonished me so was x that having no social background to give her support in what whe did, she just simply struck off.   .   .of course she did have the Methodist church back of her I I don't really like this to get on record because it sounds so conceited but it was my sense of  justice and fair play.    When I was married we went from Eldorado Texas to New Orleans.    And my father had given me some money.  /% wasn't going to need the money so I was going to deposit it in the  bank/   So I had to introduce mysel: and so I said I wanted to open up an account and the cashier looked at me axa and asked me if I had my husband's permission.    And I hit the ceiling.    I said no,  its my money.    Them I found out about the laws governing married women and the husbands owned everything* the clothe on her back.    She owned absolutely nothing--it was a Napoleonic War law.    Course I knew my husband wouldn't take the  clothes off my back 7P but how could I be sure. And that started me really in suffrage. And then I went down and spent a good deal of time in Guatamala. .

Now why is  it we can't  sit here  and  talk with these Negro women just as though they were  just persons like us.      The was that sense of  strain,  because they had never met with Negroes of our status and that was one of the hardest things for white women to get over.

Them the same thing in the matter of race. . .It was my sense of justice and fair play and it was the only taing that ever moved me ks and it always has.   /What percentage of women in Texas were involved in the suffrage movement1J We were such a minority&amp;gt;that we zamatmt could count on suffrage organizations in the cities,  that is Dallas, Houston,  Bammszctx Austin.   .   .But in my town,  course it was a small university town, it was act the longest time before I could get a small suffrage group there.  .  .WHf I know what my father said  (I'd already gotten the bug as a result of what happened down in central America^   He this was  before was so indignant  Lmy husband had died)  that I was wanting the vote. Th.trfT That indicated that I didn't trust my husband,  that was^the men didthey voted for the women.    He couldxxt turn me out of tie house, I was on a visit,  but that was all he couldxxt do.    I turned on him in great indignation and I said,  "What about the mra women that haven't any men in their families/"    You know, it always makes a man mad as the dickens when you put a question up to them that they can't answer.    And my father couldn't answer that.    And I think he would have thrown the carving knife at me at the time if he'ax was sure it would hit. %bat was the attitude of the men. ^And the women were. . .well they didn't see any advantage of the vote because they were taken care of. And the school teachersthose that didn't have any men, they had jobs and they had sense enough to keeps their msaxtfe mouths shutI mean to hold their jobs. And it was only in these larger cities where there were a good many independent women, I mean independent financiallynot only unmarried women but they were free. When we had a suffrage meeting, an annual meeting, if we had as many as 50 delegates from all over the state that was a good attendance. I was working in the legislature i  for married woman's property rights. You see a good many of the laws of Texas were based on the Napoleonic laws because it was settled by so many of the French, the i-pams^., and the Mexican. And the married women of Texas had no property rights/ $h.e  had no control over her children. Her husband could divorce her. He could take the children. He could decide what schools the children would go to. If the children were old enough to be working, the wages of the children belonged to the husband. If the wife was working her wages were community propertythat* was a nice name but he had entire control of the community property and spent it himself, wjl, I was a widow. I didn't have any husband and I ax used that on purpose. S0 we decided, a group of us, to introduce the married woman's property rights. And two things we wanted: the use of her own property, it was to be community, but it was to be disposed of in xx a community senseam,and guardianship of the children, of course I had to do tkxxxtsxag the speaking before the committee. The chairman of the committeeof course they had a special meetingthe n -                          " was such a gentlemen, he was so courteous, so considerate of mex. I don't know how I lookedI ought to have looked *~ rx liked a fighting peacock cause that was the way I felt.    How the law protected the women, how she was safe from everything because of the way the law was set up.    Of course he assumed I didn't know anything about the law.    An unmarried woman had her own property, you see.    And when she became a widowjftkm if she had inherited any property from her father while  she was married it became community property;  if she inherited it after he died it was hers,    of course all of  that was overlooked.    So I- got up and I asked a question.      . I said,   "Then as long as a woman is married and her husband is living she's feeble-minded,  but  just let the husband die  and she gets her sense back,  doesn't she."    of course,  I knew that we weren't going to get the bill anyway so I might as well get something out of my system. But she had a mind and an intellect until she married,  them she lost  4+     on/3     ehfi    d'lln t+    -ro-o*r.     i 4-     milevio     %kw    1%o"~'&amp;gt;    f    b4/?.-BH        "-VIn    P. * H      -4". eventually joint guardianship of the children and then ofpourse in a, the matter of community property there was a homestead tht the husband could not sell without his wife's permission,but if they had a whole lot of other property, he could sell it without her. And this came out in the hearing. The lawyer had to take the wife asideewhen they wanted to sell the homestead to be sure that her husband did not influence her in signing it and so he would explain it all to her. Oh, it was the most awful thing, almost as bad as a lynching. And she would sign the paper. . .so she was protected in the homestead law. So we got that changed. . .Those were the things we were P working for.    Of course we didn't have the influence we had after we got the ballot.    And I don't think we were particularly pretty,  I know I wasn't.    %/Met a big oil man, talking to his son on the floor of the Senate-^/^nd he said^/Jon't you know how much the law as it  is now saves my son when he comes to pay his income tax?     .It saved him thousands of dollarsthe community property thing.    Well,  that was 4Jr ?3 the kind of thing that we ran up against. In all of this I selxxwbxx mixed my race relations.    How in the name of heaven I ever got anything in politics when at the same time I was working for something for the Negro.    I went i&amp;lt;&amp;gt;o race relations before I went into the ballot.    The way I got into this racial situa-waraxxx I had been moved by the matter of accusing this Negro woman,  my cook.   .   .The county superintendent was a descendent of the old South in South Carolina.    She of course was a graduate of the undersity there and had gone on and gotten ax master's degree at the University of Chicago which threw her out of line anyway because really* a Southern lady wouldn't want all that education.

But they never were converted until they found they were going to have a financial loss in it.    I mean that public opinion was going to be against them,   they'd come out in support uf a thing and never to t^oir disadvantage.   .   .But in the mean time I was mixing race and politics. But you see we did get the full vote in 1919, the liquor was  in 1918 and they always said that women got the vote to nail down the  I8th amendment.    But we didn't nail it down so very securely* .   . This Senatorthey0 were working for good roadsBan knead of Alabama was the man that did more to  get good roads.    They were laving kx a meeting in Dallas and he was to speak and he'd been given what he was to speak on and he got up and he quoted Sam Jones the evangeli: .  .   .He said, he had been told to talk on this.   . %\and I had the same feeling that Sam Jones had when they wired to him in Ark. to talk on a certain subject and he wired back you can give me any subject you please but I'm going to talk on what I want to.   .   . Now all of this was part of my education.    And it wasn't aaxa anything I got when I got a degree.    Nothing on my diploma showed tha C I got anything like this but it was  just getting out ax&amp;lt;t with the 4^-^r people and learning these things.    And you know if anybody had told me these things I wouldn't have believed it. And when we had this hearingthis was another bill we had up % and that was eaual wages.    The wages that they paid womenI don't are know that they^were equal  yet.    But we had in San Antonio so many Mexicans.    There was a good business in shelled pecans.    And the Mexican girls and women were sussing the pecans and of course they lost if they didn't get them out whole.   .   .and they were not paid enough actually to buy one meal.    They were as helpless as the Negro. And we got that story.    Of course I was hot on that.    But my mother was not sympathetic at first because we employed in our telephone business quite a few womenall the operators.    And I was working for equal pay and we weren't paying equal but I didn't know it.^ut I'd p a done it anyway,I know.  'So we were naving this meeting and the old scoundr@l--the gentleman from Galveston was chairman of the committee- and the women that were opposed to it.    He brought  up the question of how much we paid our cooks,    one woman--oh she was against it so--and she said oh if this bill is passed the first thing you know all the women will be getting out of the home and what will become of the children.    Oh it was the most impassioned defense of motherhood that o you have ever heard*    oh I made a strong talk for it and the more I fought for it the more I knew I had to get in my car and go back to Georgetown and raise the wages of those operators*    And I didwe could afford it.   .   .And I got into alot of trouble and s I really became a Christian because there were so many things I zzxxadvoca t $a&amp;&amp; that I wasn't doing that I had to begin to  do to  justify.    It was a good education and it really cost more than my degree in college.   .   . 1*    We got fehe vote and I went to the Democratic Convention x as a delegate in San Fransdsco at Madison Square and at Houston in 1924 *HF   Tt&amp;gt; '  and 1928 and then I moved to Georgia.   .   .Then I didn't mix politics in Georgia because I wasn't a Georgian to  begin with,  didn't  know anything much about the state and then I had taken on the whole South, you see,  as Director of Woman's Work.   .   . /How did you first become involved with the Interracial Commission?/    .   .the YMCii turned over all the surplus on the race in the South.    And Ashby Jones--you know, he was a fighter and he didn't pull his punches.    If all the Baptist minister*had been like that tie Baptist Church would have been better off.    Then they had to  keep employed all of the YMCA*"secretaries.   .   .and they approved of Dr. Alexander who had taken a leave of absence from the Methodist Church He was a preacheralways regreted it and was on the defensive.     Being a preacher w s  no* against him from the YHCA point of vie:?,   it v.-os definitely for him.    He had been working with the Negro soldiers.   .   . It was really an outgrowth of the YMCA.    Mr. King from S. C. was the treasurer of the YMCJf and he was made treasurer of the Inter. Commissi .      .because the YMCA, they had a level head.    There were certain things that the new organization had to meet and they as had plenty JP of their men on hand to see that they met  'em.    And nothing of course was said about the women.   .   .The first thing they were going to do was set up state interracial councils and that exx wasn't easy.   .   . They were perfectly willing to have an interracial commisssioh without any Negroes on the.   .   .but it eventually sunk into the minds of the white people that they couldn't know what the Negroes needed unless they were on the committee and talked to them.     .But when the Negro would tell what they wanted,  the white people would decide what they wanted and then the white people would give them what they thought they wanted.    Perfectly in the pattern.   .  .They had to get white vtf? I people on the committees whose status was such that they wouldn't be attacked. ^Membership of the Texas committee/ We have some pretty belligerent women in the Methodist Church.  (I'm not speaking of myself.) And Miss Belle M Bennent was the Secretary of the Meth. Women's Council and she heard of this movement. . .But it so happened that they vmxs  had been giving some money to the men, to the interracial movement. And they had some pressure, and they brought t it on Dr. Alexander who was a Methodist preacher and pushed and pushed until eventually they decided to set up a woman's committee separate from the men. We would meet the day before the men met and then we would come in this actually happenedwe would come in and sit with the men and 7*1  think they had too many Meth. women on their committees -listen to what was being done. . .1 got a telegram from Mrs. Johnson she was one of the member s of the Council of the Meth. church and she had been made Director of Woman's WorkI had never done any chur&amp;h work,but she wired me because I was then /resident of the League of Women Voters. They were going to have a woman's meeting in Dallas and would I attend. I was also on.the letterhead of the Federation of Wpmen's Clubsyou get the point, I was on the letterhead, that was all. . .Mrs. Johnson had brought the resolution already made out that we were to endorse, turned over to Miss Maggie Barrett (?) who was president of Home Demonstration. There's not anyone who's going to sign a document made out to someone else. So when we retired to our committee, she studied and thought it was very good, but we could better it. So we bettered it considerably and we added a few things that weren't in itI Well, there was that Miss Nannie Burrought, a Negro woman Mrs. Johnson brought with her. You understand there were no Negroes present at this first meeting. Miss Nannie had a girls'school in Washington. . .Oh wethe most h&amp;?2 sanctimonious peopleat least I was.    We had condemned lynching. We had made the most noble statements about the rights of the Negroof course we didn't know anything about it and it was  just a matter of having a vocabularyat least that's the way it looked to me afterwards.    But I was  just so proudsuch a noble document. We read it.    Miss Burroughs got up to speak and the one point ta s-Jc spoke to was our condemnation of lynching.      .She  said that when the white women get ready to stop lynching,   they'll stop it and it won't be stopped before*    Because lynching is carried on for the protection of white women.    That talk that she made was not more than tern minutes but when she sat down my head was sunk because there was where the responsibility was put on me.    I didn't want to take the ~-&amp;gt;*i.j*    v~      w**v      w MU    w        umnt i  u wvv?         tax O      u hjjuljlxz&amp;gt;{J    UU.U     UX'OJSS Uit3    Qil me.      .and they kept putting pressure on me and I said .well you know I'm busy in politics,  I'm president  of the League of Women Voters. But that talk that Nannie Burroughs made just kept with me and I   ./ said I'ii answer the next day and there wasn't ^ything else for me to do.    That's why I say so often the principles I stand for have gotten me into trouble.   .   . Then the point was made that I had all of these contacts.   .   .that I was using in politics and that I could also use them in race..    And I was thoroughly respectable because I ^already been around long enough to know that if I was out to grab a husband I wasx unfortunate, I hadn't been able to.    That yet subconsciously I think we all knew that it was just simply a statement,  that we didn't intend to do anything about it.   .   . For two years.   .   .I'd been altogether free.    I mean, we'd sold all our telephone company.    Then I got a telegram from Atlanta calling me to come to Atlanta and they wanted me to go on the payroll. We had our meeting in Dallas-and we pnoood our resolutions i#-#9 It was harder for me to do that in a way than come out against lynchin because when you're taking pay your're tied.    Well, I didn't get tied because I couldn't be.    They wanted to know how much I wanted as a Probably salary and that stumped me.    I didn't know how much I was worth. A I thought I was worth a great deal more than they thought I was.   .   . So I put a low figure on it because I wasn't expecting to give full time.   .   .That was about 1924.   .   . and of course the women accepted me we pnosoc produced and they had to be passed on by the men.    That was a position that I had never been in before and I resented it.   .   .Mrs.   Johnsonshe was a good Methodistand she was  "handing down" our program.

Called him up said,xDon't you every committm me to anything without getting my permission."  Walked all oter Macon Co.    "xx I was walking on Dr. Alexander every step I took."    Said something to Dr. Eleazer about that"and he said if I had any complaint to make to Dr. Alexander.   .   .tht he would be a hearing wall if I wanted to  talk.    I told him I didn't want to talk.    So he and I had no contact.   .   .They had every reason in the world to feel the way they did about me  because he was the publicity man and he did do some awfully good work.    He put on that contest in the schools.   .   .He was really an intellectual person; he could do anything with his mind. But he x was not a personality that gathered people to him.   .  . He was a pacifist.   .   .Dr. Alexander was up in N.C.   .   .and Dr. Eleazer told a man-A" pacifist organizer/ that he could use the telephone in the Inter,  office.   .   .and he would come in in the morning and sit practically all day.   .   .1 made some remark to Dr. Eleazer that I didn1 think that was the right thing to do.    But that man was a pacifist, taxxx right now he would have been called a Communist,  you understand and maybe he was.    You see I was so concerned with the work tht I wasn't thinking of myself as a person in this  thing and whether I was going to be liked.    Mr. Raper, he and I had no difficulties. He was terribly--well you know Miss Clay was a spinster and the other two women^were  spinsters.    And he came from the hospital and before he got the door closed^he'began to detail the details of the birth of his first child.    And Miss Clay never could stand him since because he was vulgar.. WHx,Well,  of course I'd had three babies,  the widow of a doctor and I wasn't easily shocked by a thing like that but I was tickled.   .   . In okla.,  Texas and Arkansas I had done away with the women's division and we  just had one Interracial Commission.    I didn't believe in segregation, you know*   .   . /Sir.

I sold it to the women.    I didn't make the approach--! still was a politician.    I  sold Mrs. Underwoodshe was the state chairman of the women's committee-and she got several others.    Then they took it up with Dr. Alexander.    I back of don't fcnqw whether he had any idea that i was ^flhind. it,   but if he didn't he was more feeble minded'than I think he was.    Then the sedond meeting after that they decided that the women would be a part of the whole.xxx We could have a chairman separate if we wanted to but we met with the men and had the same program to carry through.    After that happened Mrs. Underwood waaoxx when I would be out of the office in the V* ft ! field somewhere would come down and take over my secretaries and dictate letters.    And it made Emily Clay and Arlene Park xxm perfectly furious.   .   . I was practically doing all the field work.    Clark Sbwjexx Foreman /heard about the Interracial Commission at the London School of Economics/   Dr. Alexander made him field  secretary for Georgia.    &amp; We had very little contact.

And I wanted to go on with the work because I liked it.    Butxx I found out from Guy Johnsonyou know he's one of the most innocent grown persons I know, by innocent I mean he xedsx didn't realize what he was telling me when he told me what happened.

But what he was doing was putting me in what he thought was a humiliating. situation.    My salary was to be cut in half.    My name was not to be on the letterhead.    I was to have no identity at all.    Guy Johnson told me all that.    And I told him I was not going axxscxtx to go on with the new organization.    And he was broken up because he wanted me to go on and he later on tried to get me to take a special piece of work,    But I stayed until the Inter.

They continued it for awhile and then they changed it the name of it and they were blotting me out of existencebut I kept on breathing just the same. /what was youfr^ role in building up to the formation of the Southern Regional Council?./   .Dr. Cole of the University of Tenn. was the man ox* they had aske to do all of this research about what the Inter. Commission had don? and where it had gone. And he came to my office quite frequently to talk it over with me because ha I was probably the most extensive field worker. /Weren't you left in charge when Dr. Will to Washington to the Department of Agriculture?/ Well, I as in charge but I wasn't left in charge. Mr* Eleazer couldn't take over because he wasn't that kind of person and it gradually developed that I was xa directing the whole work. And Dr. Alexander would come donn about once every two months and many times I never even saw him. And during those months Julian Harris, every once in awhileat least) once a week?-would come and take me to lunch. And it got to beI didn't know itthat they fancied that Julian Harr and I had x something odd in common. Well we did have. He was the New _York Times, correspondent and when anything developed or anything came up that involved race. . .lynching or anything elsehe'd come down and asked me to go over--right across the street there was a place to eatand then he'd want to get the lowdown on it. Eventually he wrote for. . .an article and in that article he paid me high credit for the Commission, used my name and all that.  .and when it came out he called me up and asked me how I liked. I said it was very good but what you've done is you've signed my resignation from the Commission. Because you see Dr. Alexander still felt that he not only was head of it but he ought to get the credit of  everything that had been done eve in his absence.    I knew I was out then.   .   .1 think Dr. Alexander had wanted to  kick me out for a long time anyway.      .Miss Clay was the  one that told me that what Dr. Alexander wax told her that I was trying to do was to be made head of the Inter.   Commission.    Well I wouldn't have taken it for anything because I couldn't do xxx xxx field work and that was where I was learning so much and was so important /in 1937^x/l think I may have told you that the Negroes at that meeting out there insisted that the field work be taken backthat is with the states.    And Dr. Alexander said there was nconeMrs. Newell was onfthlsand Forrester Washington said Mrs. Ames could take it. Then he went back to Washington on the train with Mrs. Newell and he said some very unpleasant tnings about me and Bertha didn't very mucn like them and she told mer-7here was nothing I could do about it. //Then, he came down in about two weeks.xxx He had come into the office and he said he wanted to see me.    I went out to meet him and he a had already gotten up to leave--there was a sort .of a hall there.    And he told me that I was to tefice the whole field work responsibility.    And I was perfectly willing to do it but I had to change the title.    I couldn't go around as Director of Women's Work and expect the men to come to any meeting that was called by the Director of Woman's Work I knew my brothers too well.    He didn't see any reason to change the title.    And I said well if I'm responsible for the field work official I've got to have anotherxxxx title.    x""Take any title you want."    And he turned his back on me and went out of the office.    And I took the title I wanted which was Director of Field Work* Now this soundf like I was having a hard time but I wasn't becaus I'm a fighter by nature.    And I was armed the whole time.    But I had sP-sr? * nothing against Dr. Alexander. I was so buried in this work and the progress of it and getting converts and getting new things started and I did get new things started. . .1 was supported by the women and the men. And the Bishop over at Jackson, Miss.,  the Episcopal Bishop--that was where I spoke about the Negro having the vote the first time.    And you know what I got as a result of itI got a free lunch.    He took me out to lunch and he almost prayed that I would never endorse publW publlcally the Negro vote.    And I told him I couldn't help it.   .   . He didn't weep but he did sound like he was  just about ready to pray and he may have been doing it internally.    But I couldn't.    I thought that was the thing the Negroes needed to be able to speak for themselves.   .   ./Second time she mentioned itin Montgomery.

And there was nothing I could do about it until they got the vote.   .   ./story about Seek Georgetown principal who couldn't protect his wife from bein^lnsulted or raped./ And you know I wasI don't think anyone could have gone through what I did without being emotionally disturbed.    &amp;5 So I didn't feel,  you see, when the Council came alongand I don't think that I would have fitted into the Council because the work that I had was doing the Council had to change the  sort of gener; direction of the thing.    And I might have been able to go along becaus I didn't know anything about it but by that time I was awfully tired and my mother had diedhere.    Look,  I wasn't desolate or anything like  that.    I never have been lost for more than 25 or 30 minutes at ZT60 ! at a time. xxxBxt But I knewyou know this is one thing about Mrs. Tillyshe doesn't know that she's through.    A ad when you don't know that you're through but you keep hanging on I don't think you get satisfaction.    Of course I never would have recognized Mrs. Tilly.    she has  just faded so--more  so than I have.    And I've fadedI'm talking about my face.    I'm not talking about my insides. After the FEPC had been set up and Randolph had threatened to descend upon the president.   .   .Mark Ethridge was made chairman of the committee to go through the South to  see whether or not those firms and corporations that had federal grants were giving the Negroes a fair share  (?).    The white people were speaking for  the Negroesthe Negro wanted all these things and they  knew what the Negro wanted and I thought the time had come for the Negroes to have an opportunity It?. by themselves  to stty what they w&amp;nted*the Southern ftsgroes.     -^en that /article/ of Gordon Hancocks came out and I thought that was where to begin.   .   .Oh I was reading about 20 Negro newspapers a week and I saw it.   .   .But the point was that even if they drew up a charter /of what they wanted/ it wouldn't reach the whiten people.    It had to reach the white people. .   .And that was what I was wanting them tsxz* artsxx to do, was to be able to speak to the white people and have the white people hear'em.    It was the hearing of  them.    Then of course I put my put my foot in hand 4^"and went  up to Richmond and had a long talk with him.    He was not accepting because the Southern Nsgro,  as Dr. Alexander said, had no leadership in the South.    All the  leadershi of the Negroes were  in the North.    And of course  that made me ind^nant So I talked to him about having an all Southern Negroes^no Northern Negroes present and no white people present.    If the Northern Negroes were there then the white people'^ said    the N. Negroes directed what was^K^   said.    If the white people of the South were there then the &amp;u ! Northern Negroes would have said the white people directed it. And I put that before Gordon Hancock.   .   .and he did see that and he did go and talk to P.B. Ypung and P.B Young was all for it.    Meanwhile x Gordon Hancock was the one that was going to have to accept all of the things that were going to  be said against it because he was P the man in front. And after they agreed to do it and I had made the 2nd trip up to Richmond and that was when I had pledged myselfthe Lord knows how I ever had the gall to do itthat the white people would meet and respond. And on that promise EewjExtxx&amp;sxK went ahead. Then I found out that he had not included a single ws Negro woman in that meeting and that was the only xxixg suggestion I madethat Negro leading women should be represented in that group and there were aaa#,Negro women in the South. Well, then they included Negro women. Charles Johnson of Fisk v.as chairman* of the committee that arew up the resold tionsthat was the Durham Statement. Meanwhile I had talked to the ed. of the Birmingham News and the Montgomery paper and I had gone over--I it was no trouble getting the Texas people in Houston and Dallas lined upthe editors. And I'd gone on to Arkansaslittle Rock. . .And then of course I talked to Ralph McGIll. They were all very cooperative except they would not commit themselves until they saw what the Negros were going to put out-which was simply a matter of wisdom. . .1 went over to Louisville and saw /the editor who had asked her to speak to the Southern Editors Assoc./ Then it came out. And then Gordon Hancock became very unriflay uneasy because he evidently expected almost immediately a meeting of the white people. And we didn't meet until the following spring becau: . . .Ralph McGill wrote in his column. . .and that was when I went aft&amp;lt; him to zxazs chair that meeting. Then I went back again with these editors  and  I  those   that   I  didn't   see  I  mailed what   the   TJe*-rr.Aa   hn &amp;IZ '     ! said.    They didn't mention segregation--they didn't say anything like that.    They wanted better schools,  better economic  opportunities, they wantedlike that Negro man that worked for methey didn't put ii in these words-but they wanted respect. /^Eventuallywe had to send out invitations to this meeting.    We had to work out how we were going to do it.    And  the Commission I was  keeping completely out of  it because I wanted t it to be a volunteer thing.    Then we got these leadersthe labor leader here in Atlanta,  Bishops,  professors,  outstanding? people,  people of real importanceoh we got the Catholic Bishop  (he was in Savannah thenits quite unusual when the Catholics cooperate).    Mr.  Shumaker came on itno  it was another  Jewish person and he said on Rebecca's  gallery  (?),  he said to me that it was  just because he was a business man that he stood out.    I was afraid when ne started out it was  because he was a Jewbut  that had nothing to do with it.    I had to have the business people represented.   .   .^question of whether names were going to be typed of be in signers handwriting^/ pThen. the  question came of where were the answers to be sent and I phoned down to Bishop Moore and he was down in Newnen.    And we had to know right away.   .   .and I had him called from the table and he came and I told him we wanted the replies sent to him^because that was really respectable if you were sending your replies  sent to a Bishop. Well he henfed and hawed and said why didn't I have them sent to a box number.    And I said noJTthat was anonymous.    Well what would he do wit them, did he have to answer them.    And I said no you send them to Ralph McGill.    Then Ralph sent  them on to me.   .   .That why we  kept the Commission out of it.   .   .And the fact that those signatures were not typed txxx but were in the handwriting of those people made them very personal.    /Josephine Wilkins remembers tracing the signiatures^j/ And the President of the Louisville and Nashville RR wrote the Uft^f-_J.   i_*4.^_ 4.k4.   ., m-;a   Maaihiv  imae-ine and the whole tone  of &amp;lt;&amp;63 it that we were cutting unaer the boys who were fighting and the  thing go do was to wait until the boys came home.    It was a blistering lette; .   .   . That was the meeting that Gordon Hancock expected us to have just like that after the meeting. Then we had it.   .   .well they met and there were about 95 of 100 and they came on their own expense.   .   .and I told Ralph McGill that standing vote or we were not to have.a.hand vote/   bug but they had to come up and sign the  thing because I said if they got potshotted when they got back horn they could say that their names were   .   .   .But their names were there, ut four of them did not  sign,  we had 90 of them that signedcame  up and put  their names down there.    /Wired others for permission to  use their names.

We met at the old,  old church you know that figured so in the Civil War.    It was very interesting.    But I was out then.    It wss taken over by Dr. odum andDr. Alexander.   .   . My idea labor was to take the names of these menthe lawyers and the laj^people and the educators and so on who had signed it and put upon them a request that they work on that thing in their communitiesnot forming a new organization but  just spreading a state of mind.    Why*  I had no idea of a new organizationI wasn't thinking of that.    Then of course it was taken out of my hands.      .x%x%tkK%Trwz?xzx &amp;gt;$3uy Johnson a very unhappy man.    It came out in the paper that he had resigned from the UNC.

I didn't want to go back to Texas because I didn't want to cannibalize my daughter Lulu.    Because if I'd gone back she was where we'd always lived but she wasn't yet on her feet. Theni that was the  end of it.    xxx I was made a member of the Board.     Guy Johnson wanted me  to come back and finish that domestic service survey that we'd made and I told him no because if you're going to break then you've got to.break like this.    You can't wait and hang on to a little bit of a task here and there.    You've  just simply got to cut and break off.   .   . Then eventually I resigned from the Board because nothing was being done.    I think I may have remarked this.    I  know Ira Reid had been giving the responsibility of making a study of the way way Negroe; were being treated on tne streetcars,   .   .and  he madesr m  perfectly fine clear report of the way the Negroes were treated.    And nothing was dont about it.    And I went back to Tryon.    George Mitchell was then the chairmanGuy Johnson had resigned.    And I wrote to him and resigned. /Sent him a check to cover expenses.    Had taken her files with her. George Mitchell borrowed them to read them./ more ^xgxxgxxHg Then I had noAcontact with the Council at all.    This was the first time that I had contact.    And it wasn't that I was against it.    It was just that there wasn't anything that I could see to do.    And the only thing thing I could do was be a member.   .   , But you ought to see my little  town in Tryon.

Well I think it's been worth while.    Well,  like I said,  I've had no contact with the Council but it was simply because there wasn't anything I could contribute.    And I have never been a deadhead.    I can't belong to something and just sit.   .   . /Scared as the  dickens when she had to  keep promise that white Important people would resign.

Getting a decision on thisit couldn't be done. . .The first thing that came up was from Texas--they did away with the white primary. You see in the white primary that simply meant that the Negroes could vote in Texas if they'd paid their poll tax except tht there was a white primary and only a white person could vote. And the same thing was true in Ark. That was after I'd gone to Tryon, along about'47 or %8. And then the next decision on the s schools which would come 6 years later-things grow. Nothing is done all at once when you're really changing the pattern. The change in the pattern grows as you see the need of it. . .Reviewing all of this work that xx I've doneit was very exciting, very important. The excitement of it was right there but the importance of itwhat x it was going to lead toyou see we had no object that we v;ere leading to, it v,os to m &amp;et one thing done at a time and spread out. And then when something else arose--well this was something else we had to move in on. I think when a program is flexible enough so it can be changed when the conditions change that organization has a place. But if it is inflexible and it has set up what it was gonna do and stick to it and the times change that organ? izations time's up. . .
