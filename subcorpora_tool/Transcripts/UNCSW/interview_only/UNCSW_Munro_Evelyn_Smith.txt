Evelyn Smith Munro: Well, I don't know how to start with my family, because I think one' s family is undoubtedly the thing one knows least about /laughter/, really. You know, I think it' s very difficult to talk about one's family. I grew up in New Orleans and in Lafayette. My mother was . . . well, I don't know that I can describe her. She was rather interesting and a fairly strong woman, I think, who married the black sheep of a New Orleans Irish family&#8212;who remained the black sheep. Somehow they weathered the storm, however. Anyway, during my high school years (we might as well start there, or we'll be at this, you know, for much too long a time /laughter/ if I try to go back) I became interested in the Socialist party in New Orleans. I also was constantly at odds with my father, who had a very unpleasant habit. ... (I now know too that probably I could have, if I'd known, been able to do something about it instead of meeting him head-on, because I probably was temperamentally a lot like him.  I probably could have handled the situation more intelligently.) But he used the sort of terminology, you know, of calling Negroes "coons" and "jigs" and all the rest of it, almost it seemed deliberately to offend me. And how I got my attitudes                                                          ^ &#8222;,% ^^ feelings of prejudice I don't know; but it just didn' t take, and I just never had it. So this was one of the things that created constant friction between us. Mary Frederickson: How did your mother react? Munroj Well, I don't remember really. I think she probably was neutral, although later she came around quite a bit and felt that she had been educated considerably by her children. But I was taught, as I think a lot of kids in the South were taught, that you never called a Negro woman Munro 2 "Mrs." and that they came to the back door: you know, the usual things. We had washwomen, Negro washwomen whom I liked very much and whom I used to spend some time with.  I read a lot as a kid.  I remember one time (this must have been probably grammar school, or maybe early high school) I was reading The Golden Bough and finding all these superstitions, and then comparing them with the Negro washwomen,being absolutely amazed at how some of them were the same stories. And so I had a relationship that was sort of friendly and warm&#8212;as did my parents, actually. But for some reason (probably because I rejected my father' s authority as not being legitimate /laughter/, because I really didn't have a great deal of respect for him) it was easier for me to find other ideologies that I did respect. And so somehow I eventually found the Socialist party. And, as I mentioned earlier, there was a young Communist who was wooing me at the same time.  I don't know that I really was ever a serious student of political theory or ideologies. He was simply fairly simplistic I felt, you know, and idealistic: you know, the "brotherhood of man" sort of thing. So I felt happier in that area, and felt maybe it was right for me. It was one of the few organizations I ever joined. So I did join the Socialist I think we had party, and spent some time on it; / weekly meetings, or something of the kind. It was a difficult period financially for my family. MF: What was your father's occupation? What was he doing? Munro: Well, he was a railroad telegrapher, and during a lot of my early childhood he did have a job. But later he didn't, and he was out of work a lot of the time and drinking a lot of the time.  I think his job was replaced by a machine, actually, in telegraphy; that was one of the problems. So my mother was working and also going through menopause Munro $ during my high school period, and it was really pretty difficult. My father was drinking, and coming home and fighting with me, and locking me out of the apartment we were living in, and throwing my things around. It was generally a fairly rugged period. My brother, I think, was away at that time; he left and had gone to Texas to find a job. This was during the Depression also. Actually at one point my mother left, and we went to Texas to stay with an aunt. But she went back to him and left me there. And I disliked that very much, because I really was much more part of the New Orleans scene, where I had a great many cultural interests. So when I came back at Christmas it was agreed that I could stay and didn't have to go back. Actually I didn't finish high school; I never graduated or got a diploma, because things got particularly bad during that last year.  I just sort of petered out, actually. My mother was having problems and my father was drinking; and eventually I got a very bad cold and was out from school for awhile, and I just didn't go back. That was just during the last semester.  So then my mother got a job out of New Orleans in a place called Slidell, which is across Lake Pontchartrain, running a house called a "preventorium" for children who needed a place to stay to keep them, because there was tuberculosis in the family or something like that. And I got a job in New Orleans. I stayed with an aunt that I wasn't particularly compatible with. This was my first job, in a lawyer's office, when I was about eighteen. I learned to type while I was there. I guess it was shortly after that when I finally gave that up, because it wasn1t right /laughter/. It didn't pay very much, and I had a feeling that he wasn't honest.  I got a job even before I left it at Gotchalk's as the manager of the bathing suit department, which I held Munro 4 for a summer. It was during this time that I was also going to Socialist party meetings. MF: Was there a man named Hermes who was a Socialist? Munro: Yes, Hermes. My brother knows something about Hermes. The only thing I really remember about Hermes was the fact that he was a barber, the neighborhood barber near where we lived. I'm trying to remember: we were near the corner of Napoleon and Josephine, and his barbershop was near there. And he was one of the Socialists. Really I' d like to know more about him, MF: I guess Dick Whitton wrote a letter to Mitch and said that Hermes was one of the best men in the party in the South. I just wondered if he was important to you. Munro: No he wasn't, except that I remember him. But I don't remember his importance, MF: Were there people in the Socialist party in New Orleans who were important to you? Munro: No, not really. There was apparently a professor&#8212;oh, his name is mentioned in one of these&#8212;Briney? Anyway, there was a faculty member. I just can't remember those people very well. I don't remember any of them vividly at all except Dick Whitton . MF: He was in New Orleans at the time? Munro: He was in New Orleans, yes. That was before he went to Commonwealth, MF: And how did you happen to meet him? Munro: He was president of the local. I don't really know how I happened to meet him /laughter/; I really don't. There must have been Munro 5 other friends. This was just one of many things that I did during this time. We had a group that was part of a group theater that did plays, including Lysistrata. This was sort of a forerunner of the Group Theater in New Orleans, like the theater in New York. We also during this time that I was in high school regularly had Saturday nights at one of the girls who had a rather nice house. We either read things that we liked like poetry or did one-act plays. It was a very rich environment intellectually, actually. My brother also at one point had a coffee shop in the French Quarter, where I used to work as a waitress in high school on Saturday nights. And we met a lot of interesting people, and closed up the shop and went out with them whenever anybody came along that was year in a fun. So that it wasn' t an honest/working class situation, you know. I never was really the real working class type at all, although we were broke. My parents were actually on relief at one time. When the welfare worker came to visit she was so interested in the books that I was reading /laughter/ that she wanted to meet me, and invited me over. As a matter of fact we became very good friends. And I started going to parties at their house, and became very close (that was the Boltman family) friends with their younger brother. I spent a lot of time there thereafter weekends. MF: How did your father react to having you go on relief? Munro: I really don't know. I suppose my mother's reaction was more severe than his. He would have taken it in his stride probably, whereas my mother would have had great feelings of shame and pride, and all that kind of thing. MF: How did they both react to your both joining the Socialist party, and also having this life? Munro 6 Munro: I think they were very tolerant, I fought with my father a lot, but I think that basically it probably didn't hurt him particularly when we did this. And I think he probably had a certain sense of pride in us, in any case. That's second guessing; I don't really know, MF: You talked about him being the "black sheep" of the family. Were you close to anyone in his family at all? Munro: No, no. I visited his sisters. We had an /laughter/ interesting collection of old maid aunts who all lived together. He had four unmarried sisters who were always known as "the girls." They lived in a big house in New Orleans, and we used to go there for lunch. They had a music box and a parrot, and it was really a marvelous kind of experience. But I never was close to any of them. The only real member of the family that I was ever close to was my mother's younger sister. When I ran away from home I used to run away there. But she certainly had no influence at all other than just a place to go, because she'd chase me out and buy me clothes, or something of that kind. No, I suppose the thing that was most important to me, probably whatever motivating force there was, came from books. MF: Do you remember anything in particular that you read at the time? Munro: No, not anything that would have had anything to do with this, because I spent the first important period of my life when my reading was largely poetry: Mallet and Keats, /laughter/ So it was not certainly. . . . I suppose again, looking at it from another direction this perhaps in not entirely unusual, I think people can be sensitized by literary experiences that may not have any direct relationship to the area in which they move. That's the only explanation. I was a romantic, and still am. Munro 7 MF: Didn't you work for a while, in addition to working at the clothing company and the lawyer' s office, for the Civic Works Administration? Munro: Oh, it was something else. What was it called now? It was sort of before NRA. It was an agricultural. ... Is it ERA or something like that, Emergency Relief Association? Yes, I did have a job in Covington&#8212;in fact I was the only one in the family with a job at that point&#8212;in a county agent's office. And that was my first real association with farmers. That was a grain and feed program, where they were provided with (what do you call them?) even loans.  I worked in that office for a period of time. That at least was something; it had some social consciousness /laughter/ raising aspect. However, during that period what I was reading was the New Yorker, so, you know, /laughter/ I was still fairly sophisticated. But it doesn't quite fit /laughter/. MF: You said you read the New Yorker, and you also mentioned reading The New Masses. Munro: Oh sure, sure. MF: Then letters were exchanged about you between Dick Whitton and Mitch? Munro: Presumably, yes. Did I get a letter from Dick? Was there such a letter? I know I got a letter from Mitch saying that Dick Whitton had come through Memphis and had suggested that I might be interested in coming to work. As I remember it, I had said to Dick at some point that now that I had joined the Socialist party I wanted to actually have the experience of learning what it was all about and working in some area where I could. So he had this in mind and mentioned me to Mitch; and Mitch wrote this letter and said that they needed someone, and they had (you probably have Munro 8 the sum) some small amount of money. MF: Room and board, I think /laughter/. Munro: Yes, room and board and five dollars a week or something like that. They suggested that I come. So I talked to my parents about it. And I remember my father was probably a little reluctant; and I remember my mother saying, "We don't have any right not to let her go to do this, if this is what she wants to do"&#8212;which is really amazing when I think about it. So I did. MF: So Dick Whitton was at Commonwealth at that time, then? Munro: I think he went through Memphis on his way to Commonwealth. He was offered the job as president of Commonwealth during a sort of. ... MF: Interim period? Munro: ... yes, interim period or a united front period or something. MF:  I had a note that Bill McHugh wrote to Dick Whitton asking him to advise you to take the job, seeing if he could persuade you to take the job. Munro: Oh really? That's interesting. Gee, where did that show up? See, I don't remember exactly what Bill's relationship in that was. But he probably was also in the party.  I' 11 have to go read those papers /laughter/,    /interruption/ MF: Then when you agreed to come up to work for the union for room and board, it was agreed that you would stay with the Ambersons? Munro: That's right, yes, I have a card (I guess it must have been right after I arrived there) to Bill, in which I said (and I'll read you a little bit of this): "Dear Bill, Everything's swell and beyond my. . . ." Munro 9 /laughter/ That was a word of the thirties, you remember? ". , , beyond my expectations, and the STFU is a much bigger thing than I had any idea. I like Mitchell and the Ambersons. I haven't met the doctor yet. I am /something/ just before getting off trying to find my way home from the office (it's way on the other side of town). Will write soon, maybe tonight if I'm able to. Write me Box 5215." So that was early on. As a matter of fact, Amberson was out of town when I arrived. In fact, when I got in nobody met me, and I think it was the first time I'd ever been anywhere. (Bill McHugh saw me off, incidentally.) I remember weeping a little bit as the train pulled out /laughter/, because it was the first time I'd done anything like this. Then when I arrived in Memphis it was night, and nobody was there.  I called the Ambersons' telephone number, and Mrs. Amberson said that her husband and Mitchell were both away, and for me to take the cab and come out. And it was raining, /laughter/ It was really very dreary. So that first week that I was there I was in the office alone, which in a way was good, because I went through all the files and sort of learned a lot about what was going on before Mitchell showed up. MF: They had just been involved in the first strike? Munro: That's right. And I think they were away on some such matter. They had some hearing going on up there, yes. MF: But then when Mitchell came back you met him for the first time? Munro: Yes. MF:  Do you remember what you thought about him? Munro: Well yes.  I wrote a little bit about that in this book that I'm trying to write. Well, I found him very reassuring, very easy to work Munro 10 with and non-threatening /laughter/ in any way. One of the first things we did, I think, that first week after he got back, he took me out to a meeting&#8212;now it's very hard for me exactly to remember these things. Uncle Charlie McCoy: has he shown up anywhere in your things? Well, he was an old Socialist in                                      or Truman or somewhere. But it was a very marvelous, exciting thing for me because I was pretty hot on some this sort of thing anyway.  I realized that here were /real, honest Socialists, real workers. And it was the first time that I ever sat down at a table with a black person, and that was extremely exhilerating /laughter/ to me.  It had just never happened before. They were sort of old time country Socialists. MF: These people were members of the union? Munro: I don't know. I don't think they were. I'm not sure. They were their supporters in some way.  I'm not sure about that; I don't really remember. Mitch would know; I don't. MF: At the time when you first came were they. . . ? It seems, as I understand it, they were just beginning to get involved in a competitive sort of situation with the sharecroppers' union. Munro: Oh no, I think that came later"; it wasn't when I first came. It was at least a year or more when Henderson, or even before Henderson. . . . They sent a young Communist organizer named Spradling. Have you heard about him, Bill Spradling? I think it's S-p-r-a-d-1-i-n-g; I don't think it was S-p-r-a-t. There was another Spratling; I think this was Spradling. He was sent by the Communist party, and one of his principal assignments was to get to know me /laughter/ and to get information from me. And so he did show up, and one way or another we got to know each other. He Munro 11 dated me, and we did things together. But he wasn't able to handle the situation; he told me /laughter/ what his assignment was, and told me the whole thing. So we really were friends. When he got arrested, as he did in a short time, I was helpful in getting him out of jail and getting him out of Memphis. But this was later; certainly all of this is, Before we started this I should have looked back and read up on some of this, because this whole Communist competitive thing didn't really begin seriously until after the CIO affiliation. And that didn't come about, certainly, for a while; I don't remember exactly which year it was. But I was pretty involved in that, because after the Spradling thing when Don Henderson was in the area and trying to organize he offered me a job also. He also told me he was a member of the central committee of the Communist party, and wanted to send me to training school, a Communist training school. But that didn't do either /laughter/.  It was sort of interesting being wined and dined. MF:  This sort of ran all the way through,     from the time when some of the New Orleans groups were wining and dining you to join the Young Communists /laughter/. Munro: That's true, that's true. I was wined and dined pretty consistently. MF: Why did you consistently make the decision not to join them? Munro: I suppose because I never believed that the ends justified really the means /laughter/. That' s a cliche", but it' s/true. And I think philosophically that's so; I have exactly the same feeling that you just don't get what you want by using whatever means are available to get it. Munro 12 MF: Before the whole CIO thing broke loose in early '56, right after you came in October of 1955, the Kent Colony was set up. Munro: Oh yes; was that the Dibble farm? The Dibble family? MF: Right, yes. How close were you to all of those kinds of incidents? family Munro: Really close, yes. The Dibble /would have been in Fleming? You know, I must admit it isn' t easy for me to remember them. I have pictures of them, though. But I was close.  One of the things I did was take people out a lot from Memphis and try to get local support from some of the churches, and spent a good deal of time actually out at the Kent Colony. Of course I was involved with doing publicity: working with pictures, trying to get support, and sending the telegrams. And so I got kind of close, in the sense of public relations job. MF: Right. Hadn't                      at one time supported the union? Munro: I'm afraid I don't remember that. MF: Do you remember anything about him? Munro: No, I don't. MF: Then in January of '56 they had a meeting near Earle, Arkansas, which was broken up, and Claude Weems was involved* he was a witness, and he was later murdered so he couldn't testify. Munro: Oh, but he was the guy who wasn't really murdered, wasn't it? MF: Right /laughter/. Munro: I know we thought he was murdered. That was the whole business: the funeral and all the rest of it. MF: Wasn't Claude Williams invited to it? Munro: That was when Claude Williams and Willie Sue Blagden&#8212;in fact we used to call Willie Sue "Willie Sue Flogden" /laughter/after the Munro 15 incident. I shouldn't mention that /laughter/. MF: What was the whole situation involved with Claude Weems? Did he ever turn up again? Munro: Yes. Well, I don't know that he ever turned up again. But we were coming back once from a Socialist party convention in Chicago, and Mitch had gotten word that he had been seen or heard of in ... oh now where is it? What's the other town near St. Louis, Missouri? Anyway, we stopped and tried to find him, tried to reach him, but I think were not able to. But we had heard that he had been seen there.  I just sort of vaguely remember that. MF: But they still went through and. . . ? Munro: Oh, that was a long time later that we heard about this. No, at this time they really felt he just simply disappeared. I think he' d been frightened to death and really left.  So they did hold this mock funeral. I've really forgotten now all the incidents. But Claude Williams and Willie Sue Blagden went to Arkansas to find out about it. But of course it was very fully carried in all the newspapers and in Time magazine, with pictures of Willie Sue's bruises. I shouldn't laugh about it, but we did afterwards. MF: Had you known her before? Was she around sometimes? Munro: Yes, yes, but not a lot. She just sort of showed up; a lot of people just kind of showed up who just became interested for some reason or other, and wanted to be involved. And of course Claude is a notorious character, and has a long history and books which you've probably seen. MF: Well, while she wasn't hurt very seriously he was beaten rather Munro l4 severely at the time, wasn't he? Munro: I don't really know how severe it was, but I think that he was beaten.  I don't really remember that. MF: How did you react to the whole idea of people dropping by, sort of, because they were interested, staying for a short while and then leaving? Munro: Oh, it was good. That was part of the things that was necessary; it was part of, really, our objective, to kind of put a mirror to the whole situation. So that was important.  I laugh about some of the things now, because I'm looking at them from a different point of view, really. MF: Well then, with all of the publicity after the Williams beating, things began to change a little bit, and the New Deal people began to respond a little more than they had before. Wasn't it more a national response after that? Munro: Yes. Well, there was a good deal of national response anyway. Norman Thomas, I think, did a lot, probably more than anybody to publicize the plight of the sharecropper. He really did. And I think there was a lot of publicity. And Gardner Jackson did a lot in Washington. He really was a marvelous guy: just absolutely fabulous. It's too bad you couldn't have know him. Or did you ever know       Jackson? No, you would have been too young. Yes, he was a great guy, really wonderful. MF: Was he around where you were working at the time? Munro: Well, he showed up; he came. I remember he was in one of the union conventions. There was a real fellowship of people, so that when people came they were close; they weren't just like visitors who just dropped by, because it actually was a dangerous enough situation to be in, Munro 15 and an unpopular enough situation in the South and in Memphis at that time. So that you really were close to people that you worked with. It wasn't simply a casual or simply an intellectual relationship; it was a comradeship. And I think that was one of the important parts of the experience. MF: Who were the people who you were the closest to? Munro: Well, of course Mitch. I wasn't close in any sense that I felt that he understood me; I felt that I /laughter/ understood him, you know. But I can't recall who I was close to: to Bob Caster, but not. . . . Blaine Tredway, who was closer to my age when I first arrived, was a young Socialist printer. Has he showed up anywhere? Well, Blaine was a good friend, and I was close to him. He later went to the co-op farm as the first co-op store manager&#8212;and, as a matter of fact, married one of the Youngs. I don't know if you know the story of the Quaker family who were there, and stayed there for a long time. But Blaine I was close to.  Dr. Amberson was important to me. Though I lived with the family I really never had very much of a relationship with Mrs. Amberson.  I was fond of the children; I read to them a lot and took care of them. But Dr. Amberson was important, because I felt that I could learn from him; and I think I did. He used to help me with the dishes at night, and talk about things. But he was an important person. Sam Franklin was very important /laughter/. Sam Franklin was director of the co-op farm. He was the Presbyterian missionary who came to do the co-op farm. MF: I was going to ask you a question about Dr. Amberson. How close was he to what was going on in the union per se? Was he directly involved? Munro: Oh yes, he was directly involved. He was probably an important Munro 16 counselor for Mitch and the rest of them. He was also a Socialist and a party member, and I think he gave them a great deal of advice during those early years. MF: Why was he particularly interested in either the Socialist party or in the union? Munro: Well, I don't know that. You'd have to ask him /laughter/; I don't know. MF: I just wondered. Munro: Well, I'm sure it was a philosophical point of view. He was a New Englander, I think, and a very, very precise person. You know, I don't know. I didn't see everybody from all those dimensions at the time, so that trying to see them from more than one dimension now is. . . . MF: But your relationship with him was one of both being involved in the same kind of work? Munro: Yes, and in being older, and someone who could interpret many things a good deal. I did a lot of listening during those years, as well as a lot of. . . . You know, I loved being part of things, as I still do, and I'd stay up all night getting out press releases and appeal letters, and writing The Ceremony of the Land with Buck Kester, and participating in things. Apparently I did more things than I even remember in the community too. I do know that I had an association with some other young people at Les Moyne College, the Negro college there. And apparently I tried to start a theater group, which I really don't remember very much about except in these letters that I wrote to Bill McHugh. Apparently I was trying to get various plays and get things going. I know we had some sort of young people's group. And when I went to the Negro section Munro 17 of town I had to get down on the floor of the car, because it was apparently dangerous for a white girl to be seen in this section of town. So I sort of remember that, /interruption/ ... a I955 letter: let's see if I can get any ideas from this. MF: You were saying that you worked in the community around Memphis, both when particular incidents were occurring and particular things were going on, and also sort of an ongoing thing (like your relationship with .    you the black college and the university). Were/one of few people doing that kind of community work? Weren't the others sort of on the road more? Munro: Well, actually I was in the office most of the time. You know, I made a few trips, but I was in Memphis most of the time. I went out to Arkansas and Mississippi and to union meetings nearby, and once or twice to other areas, but I primarily took care of the office (straightened out the correspondence and did the Sharecroppers' Voice and that sort of thine). if that's what you mean. I was more involved there, I also was involved in other things, only so much was going on during that time. The Workers' Alliance was one of the things that was going on then. Dave Benson arrived in town. And I seem to have been, to some extent, involved in helping, and I certainly was at some of the meetings of the Workers' Alliance. MF: Could you tell me a little bit about that organization: how it was set up? Munro: I'm afraid I can't /laughter/. As I remember it was mostly people who didn't have jobs&#8212;right? Yes, that's certainly what it was. I don't remember very much about it. I probably could refresh my memory /laughter/ and remember more, but I don't. Munro 18 MF: Where was Dave Benson from? Munro: I'm not sure; I don't know. I know he had a girl with him /laughter/. That was one of the problems we were all worried about, later There was also/on&#8212;and I have these clippings you might see&#8212;Elder and Smith, the Ford ATPC    organizers for the United Auto Workers situation. And I was really involved in that, the                                                status, because for some reason I took it upon myself, and there I made a great deal of threats of violence and. . . . BEGINS SIDE II TAPE I ... make a talk on the local radio station. We were invited to go or were asked to go or something, and I went went with them to make the broadcast. And the station itself was beseiged /laughter/: the people beating at the doors. I can't remember exactly how it was resolved, but we really had problems getting away from the place. And they were beaten up really badly during this time, both of the guys. But it was about the time. And that I remember quite well, going with these guys (somebody needed to be with them). MF: Was there ever any threat to you personally? Munro: Well, this letter /laughter/ says: "We've been going through absolute hell here (this is June 8, I956). How it is to all come out I for one can't see at all. Today the Memphis chief of police announced to the press that they intended to arrest everyone suspected to be a member of the union in Memphis. Of course the city is filled with refugees from Arkansas, and this is his way of playing the game with his planter friends in Arkansas. Saturday afternoon began the Memphis seige. McKinney's house was raided, and six union men who were there were arrested.  (McKinney Munro 19 was a black.) They were looking for McKinney, but he is in Washington. The men are being tried in police court today on charges of vagrancy. We have expectations of the office being raided at any time, also Mitchell's house. He   brought some of the files over to me to keep in my room for safekeeping, /laughter/ We are working now on trying to get some lawyer from away from the whole section who is big enough to be able to go into an Arkansas court without being mobbed, as almost anyone locally would be. I suppose you have the last press release about the Benson case." That was this that I was just telling you about. "I am just about nuts with the whole business: have been working rather too much, probably, and things become more and more complicated." And so on from there about a friend from Commonwealth.  "Well, the evening paper is just out, and judging from the chief's latest assininity, Mitchell will no doubt be arrested any time. Whether or not it will also include me I don't know." So it was really a lively period. "You needn't bother to send me Clyde Johnson's address." I don't remember; I know he was involved.  "We have it, of course, and correspond with him. Clyde incidentally&#8212;and confidentally&#8212; is Tom Burke; did you know that? /laughter/ Have you met him?  I fear that he married Ann what's-her-name, the Communist. They were organizing the farmers' unions. We differ somewhat there; don't believe in their new line for unity, which of course means OP supremacy in the South." I don't really remember all of these incidents, but obviously it was a time of considerable tension /laughter/, MF: You say in there that you have a lot of doubts about how it will come out. And in Jonathan Daniel's book you say, "I know it will all be fine, I know this will work." You were speaking specifically about the Munro 20 cooperative. Munro: Co-op farm, yes. And of course it didn't work, but it seemed to me that it should work. MF: Do you remember being much more optimistic about the cooperative farms, the whole program, than you were about the union itself? Munro: No. I think that the co-op farm was a small unit that you could really deal with. And of course it was something that you could really go down and see, and sit in on meetings of one small unit.  I don't think I doubted the fact that the union had to exist and had to operate. But there wasn't any one answer to that, whereas the co-op farm: OK, this was a way the farmers could make it in the South. I thought at that time that it was possible to form cooperatives.  So I don't know that it was a one yes and one not. I probably just personally found it very relaxing and enjoyable, and found people that I had more in common with, perhaps really, on the farm, than I did in my daily work with the union. MF: You visited and spent time in the Delta Cooperative? And also, what about the Hill House cooperative in northern Mississippi? Munro: That was later. That was Providence, right? I think it was called Providence, the second farm. MF: The Hill House Cooperative. Munro: No, there was Delta and then there was Providence, although Hill House sounds familiar in some way. But the second farm was called Providence. But maybe it was in Hill House, Mississippi, the Providence farm. And that was later. I really spent a lot of weekends on Delta Farm. MF: So you would just go down for the weekend, or you would spend the summers? Munro 21 Munro: No, no, I went down for the weekend.  I did spend one summer there as a member of the Quaker work camp. MF: What was the relationship between the people running the cooperative and the union and the Quaker work camp? Munro: Well not really very close, except via me maybe /laughter/. I think I was the relationship. The farm came about because of the Dibble plantation situation and that walkout and the tent colony, because Sam Franklin came down to see that situation. He had just come from Japan as a missionary, and wanted to identify with poor people in America. And so he stayed with them, because they had threatened to dynamite the tents. And he stayed there at night with them with the families. And he persuaded Sherwood Eddy to put up money to buy this farm, and then he was the first director of it. So his connection. ...  I think actually Mitchell probably never really thought that it was a very practical thing&#8212;and he probably was right; I don't know. But it was a kind of idealism that certainly appealed to me; and it was probably something that I needed and was looking for, too, because both Frank and his wife Dorothy had a style of living that was. ... Oh, he brought a lot of Japanese art and this sort of thing, and it was really very pleasant. And in addition, here was a chance to really see the cooperative idea worked out. The farm drew a group of young, idealistic people. Blaine Tredway, this printer friend of mine, went there to work. Gene Cox came from Texas; he was a theological student, and I've forgotten what his job was.  Lindsay Cox, who was my friend,(she was Lindsay Hale) was a nurse, and she came to work on the farm and deliver babies and all the rest of it. The Quaker family, Mildred and WilmerYoung, came from Philadelphia. He was a teacher, and they also wanted to identify with America's poorest. The contrast was really very Munro 22 interesting, because they were completely different from the Franklins and yet they were there for the same reason and doing the same kinds of things. And each of them lived in the standard sharecropper house that was built on the farm, but the houses were completely different once you walked in the door. The Quakers' house was very simple and very Quakerish. The Franklins' house had Japanese prints and was very warm /laughter/ and completely different.  There was no actual connection; it was just that the people who made up the first members of the co-op farm had been union members who were evicted from the plantations because of union membership. That was really the only relationship. MF: How did the people like the Coxes and the Youngs and Franklins who came down to live on the farm and to run the farm interact with the sharecroppers who had been evicted and who came? MunroJ Well, of course there are a lot of stories about that, and there must be materials. I think it went pretty well, really, considering how different they were. I remember sitting in on meetings and decisions were made. And I admit that I wasn't as mature as I am now /laughter/, so it's hard to say. It lasted pretty well, you know, the actual working relationships, and it seemed to me rather democratically run. I would say generally that I think the relationships were pretty good. MP: A few moments ago I asked you the people you were closest to in the union, and you mentioned Mitch and also Buck Kester. How were they alike and how were they different? How were they both as organizers, their style? Munro: Well, they were very different. I don't know that they were alike at all /laughter/. Buck was the sort of romantic preacher type, and Munro 2$ Mitch was a very pragmatic . . . certainly seemed, I think, closer to the people that we were working with. I don't know that I'm really qualified, because I didn't really think about that in those terms. MF: From your position in the office, when you were working with doing correspondence that both of them would be involved in and in on meetings where decisions would be made, was Mitch more the leader always? Munro: He was the leader, but he was always smart enough to get good advice. Yes, I think he always was the leader, but I think he always used the wisdom /laughter/ of other people. MF: Was he always interested in work and on what was going on? Munro: Yes, yes, I would say so, and certainly Buck's. MF: I was wondering&#8212;and a few things you' ve said sort of answered this&#8212;how you viewed the work that you were involved in then, and what you saw.  It was all very immediate work: it was dangerous and it was happening quickly, and there were decisions to be made quickly. Munro: Yes, very immediate, yes. MF: But as you said in the letter to Bill McHugh, you didn' t know exactly how it would come out. Did that sort of prevail all through the whole thing? This was something you were involved in, and that you wanted to work but you. . . . Munro: Yes, yes. I don't think anyone who was involved in what was essentially revolutionary would have had any other feeling. You know, /laughter/ it's a fluid situation. MF: Right. Overall, were you sort of more optimistic or pessimistic about how it would come out? Munro: Oh, I think I was optimistic, because I thought the people were Munro 24 marvelous. I'm sure I was really very lucky to have had that opportunity and experience, because I really will never know, I'm sure, in any other relationship people who had the . . . courage and fortitude /laughter/ and sort of an approach to living that was humorous. I mean, they really knew how to live, in spite /laughter/ of their problems, you know. They really didn't need psychiatrists or transcendental meditation.  /laughter/ They'd tell marvelous stories; they were really marvelous people. That was one of the big, big assets of that whole situation. There was a guy named Lief Dahl; he was one of my favorites. But they were really marvelous people. MF: The people you were closest to were those who were right in the area and working with the union? Munro: Well yes, members of the executive committee, all these people like that;      Hines and all of these people were in.  In fact, they used to sit in this room for meetings and meetings with the spittoon, which got used, and the room absolutely thick with smoke. When I think about it now that I've stopped smoking long since, I wonder how I ever stood it. The meetings would just go on all day long, deciding what to do and who was to do it. There was really a lot of participation; it wasn't just that these things were done in the office and then taken out there. These guys were in the office or came in from the field regularly, black and white. And this was another thing that I think was unusual about that time: there really wasn't any segregation. We traveled together; we slept in the same houses. That too was really quite unusual, long before. ... So that later when my young friends were going South for Freedom Riders and the rest of it, it seemed a little bit old /laughter/ Munro 25 to me; we'd done it already.  It wasn't really the first time it had happened. MF: How did you feel that the people on the executive committee and all the organizers who came in from the field for all these meetings reacted to you? You were one of the very few women. Munro: Yes, I know. They seemed to accept me. Maybe it was because . . . well, there I was /laughter/.  I never felt that they questioned me at all.  I think they called me "Miss Evelyn" sometimes.  In fact that's one of the things I have: pictures of some of those conventions, with me sitting out there taking minutes. And of course I served on those committees too, I think at one time on the executive committee (I've forgotten quite why that was). No, I felt that it was just really a comradeship, and I was one of them.  I suppose if you' re in dangerous situations that makes a difference. MF: Did you ever want to go out and do more work in the field than you did? Munro: Well, I did things every now and then when I felt like that, so I don't remember that I had that feeling. But there were a couple of times; one of the times (it probably is somewhere in the records) was that famous occasion when I went with a girl from North Carolina (well, I can't think of her name, but it'll come to me sooner or later) to investigate Paul Peacher' s peonage farm. Was that somewhere in the records? That was a sort of hairbrained excursion on our part, but we felt that we could probably do it, or I felt we could do it better than anybody else /laughter/ could. And so I went equipped with a camera /laughter/ to go take pictures of the farm. And of course as soon as we got there and parked the car and Munro 26 starting walking in we met Peacher himself. We didn't know; we probably would have been even more frightened if we'd known that he just a short time before had had one of the other people arrested /laughter/, one of our people in town, and there were all sorts of things going on. But anyway, all that happened to us (because I was right that it was a little easier for women in the South generally) was that I got my camera taken away from me /laughter/ and the film destroyed. We pulled some really stupid . . . said we were looking for a place to have a picnic, /laughter/ That's what we told him. MF: When you saw him? Munro: Yes. He asked what were we doing there, and I said, "Well, it looked pretty and /laughter/ we thought we' d stop and have a picnic. Anyway, you know, I did do things like that. And then there was the other time when I was with Kester and the lawyer (I guess it was Goldberg). I've got  a clipping which has that correct, either at Truman or                          (it must be at Truman, Arkansas) the time that we went to the union meeting and the thing was broken up and we were ridden out of town and threatened (if we ever came back you know what would happen). And at that time I think that maybe Kester and the other guy might have been lynched if I hadn't been along, actually. That was pretty scary; that was real /laughter/. MF: How did they take you out of town, or did you have your own. . . ? Munro: Oh, we were in our own car. What they did was, they were running bullets; and they got on either side of the running board, and then one car in front and one in back, and then drove us to the county or state border.  It was from Arkansas to Tennessee, toward the bridge at Memphis. They stopped there, and then they all got out. They came over, Munro 27 and they had us get out of the car. We didn't know what might be going to happen. But that was a very vivid experience, and I really felt the possibility that. . . . They were really beating people that day when I was there. They were breaking windows, and people were jumping out of the windows and running. The meeting was being held in a church, and they had asked us to come. And then, of course, these guys had no arms of any kind; and besides, they wanted to fight back. Frank McCallister and I had been to see these very people a short time before, and they were meeting in their homes and saying "We're just going to fight back; we're not going to let them do this to us." We told them that they just couldn't, because they'd really be killed if they did; they just didn't have the strength to do it. We simply pleaded with them not to fight back. They were going to take their hoes and this sort of thing.  So the guards just arrived with billyclubs and really beat them up, and they broke up the meeting&#8212;literally. So that was a real incident. And when you have been with people through a thing like that you're close to them. You don't have to explain who you are or why you're there or /laughter/ what your sex is; they accept you, it seems to me. MF: You mentioned Frank McCallister. How was he connected with the union then? Munro: Oh, Frank at that time, I believe, was working for the Workers' Defense League when I first met him, and I think that was why he was there. He was also doing a study for the Jewish Labor Committee, studying ... oh, he did a lot of work on lynching, and he did a study of racist organizations (Knights of the White Camelia and that sort of thing). Frank and I were very close: you know, I was a girl and he was a guy, and &amp;gt; Munro 28 he was very attractive. We had a little more than just comradeship; we were very fond of each other. And we worked a lot together too. MF: So he would come out? Munro: He would come out occasionally, yes, and come and stay for a while. MF: I wondered if you had any feeling about the people who were in Washington? You mentioned Gardner Jackson already. What about McHenry Wallace's program and Ted Wills's participation in it? Munro: I really had no real . . . other than what I heard and what I was told, and what I read.  I'm sure I had opinions /laughter/, but what they are now I don't remember. MF: Right. What did you think were the greatest strong points of the whole union, of the whole idea of a union? Munro: Well, I guess one of them certainly was&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;ah boy, that's a question&#8212;the interracial aspect; that was a strong point. And I marvel at it now. We were certainly equal from the beginning, and I think that was a very strong and amazing thing.  I think that also the fact that . . . it provided the people with sort of hope and dignity: I think that was important. Some of those meetings were really pretty marvelous meetings. They really made plans; for the first time, probably, they thought that there was some chance that they could&#8212;and they did actually&#8212;change their lives and change their destinies. I guess that' s what it gave them, a chance to cope with the situation with other people. I don't know. It sounds very simple /laughter/, but that's, it seems to me, what it was. Certainly I was more impressed in some ways with the blacks than I was with the whites in that situation. I think they were stronger people, stronger Munro 29 organizers, probably not beaten down as badly as the whites had been. MF: Why do you think that was? Munro: Well, maybe they had been able to maintain self-respect more, because maybe the contrast of the whites with other whites who were. . . . You know, all black people were pretty much in the same situation, whereas the whites who were in this situation felt degraded, I think. MF: The plantation owners were also white. Munro: Yes. MF: Do you think that perhaps religion might have had something to do with the difference between the blacks and the whites? Munro: Oh sure, sure, although they both seemed to have fairly strong religious convictions, and they seemed to be pretty closely the same. Of course one of the great things about the blacks is that they were marvelous preachers. You know, the preacher organizers. ... But then that worked the other way too: a lot of blacks were used by plantation owners in order to keep people from doing anything. So I don't know. Certainly I felt that the black people were extremely strong. But I wasn't a sociologist. MF: What do you think were some of the main weaknesses in the programs? Munro: I don't know that I'm really&#8212;at least tonight&#8212;able to cope with that. Oh well, perhaps the leadership itself; I don't know. It may have been that sometimes the people like Mitchell, Butler and Kester weren't close enough; I think that's quite possible. They probably knew a heck of it a lot more how to handle things, but really weren't able to interpret/to Munro JO the people. I'm just thinking that now; I don't know. I certainly didn't think that then, and I don't know whether that's true or not. MF: If you had to think in terms of allies and enemies /laughter/, who were the best allies that the union had, in the South and nationally? Munro: Well nationally, certainly the Workers' Defense League, the Socialists and the liberal labor people like Walter Reuther and those people. Well, largely Socialists, liberals were certainly the best friends, both in the South and nationally. MF: You mentioned Norman Thomas before. Munro: Yes, Norm was one. MF: Did you know him yourself? Munro: Oh I knew him, yes, quite well. Yes, he came down a lot, and then when I went to New York certainly met him and continued to see him. Yes, Norman was certainly and basically the inspiration, I think, for the whole thing. MF: The union had an awful lot of enemies&#166;.    Who were they? Munro: Oh, I don't remember that part of it.  I'm sure that certainly some of the political southern politicians, and certainly some of the southern planters. MF: Do you think a lot of the                          on how the union really sort of crumbled from within, the infighting within the group itself, was responsible for the ultimate Munro: No, I don't think it was that. I think it was the time.  I think it was the external events rather than the infighting. Well, I don't really know either. And of course there were the internal problems with Butler and the Communists and Commonwealth, and the fact that there really Munro 51 wasn't any money to run things, and Mitchell was off and I was off. But I think that probably, without really knowing about it, there were changes taking place in the economy, and the war was going on. I think there really were other reasons why this would have happened, MF: There were two attacks that were made on Mitchell, that I wondered what you thought about at the time, if you can remember; the attack by people from Commonwealth, which came sort of consistently and became very important right prior to World War II. Munro: Well, tell me about them, and then I'll tell you whether I remember them or not. MF: /laughter/ Well, the idea that he was attacked at one time, I think, for the failure of the strike that he called, and then also for failing to cooperate with the Communists or failing to cooperate with the sharecroppers' union and wanting to remain separate. Munro: Oh, I certainly didn't remember that as being specific. But I don't think that that has anything to do with anything ending. I think if anything, that the Communist organization seemed to me so inept that that                                                         trouble. /Interruption/ I certainly think that the Communist influence is destructive in a lot of ways. MF: What did you mean when you said you thought the Communist groups were so inept that there was no competition, sort of? Munro: No, I just didn't think that at least the people they sent in knew the people they were working with very well. And then of course I doubted their motives too. I'm not at all objective /laughter/ about it; I was too much involved. MF: Were you ever sort of favorably impressed with things that they Munro $2 were able to do, for example, maybe the Alabama Sharecroppers' Union? Munro: No, I really didn't know very much about that. I think Clyde Johnson was the guy there, but I didn't really know much about that. You know, we were sort of separate; we never seemed to really meet. But certainly the efforts of the Henderson and UOAPAWA&#8212;over there was a Swede. What was his name, Lief Dahl? I had something to do with the demise of that last convention they called; I don't know if this story has ever been told. They were having this rival union organizing and having a convention in Memphis in Beal Street. And Frank McCallister and I went out into the field and talked to people before the meeting, trying to find out who was going and who wasn't going. And a lot of the people we knew who were going to go and be delegates to the convention (in a sense backed the convention) real weren't real Henderson people; they were/STFU people. But they went to the convention to find out what was going on, and with sort of the agreement that we had worked out that they were going to break it up. And Henderson and Dahl knew something was going to happen, but they didn't know what it was. And he kept coming and asking me, "What's going to happen?" He wouldn't let me in; I stayed outside in the lobby. We had reporters around, and he kept saying, "What are you planning?" because he sort of knew something was going to happen. And then they attacked Mitchell on the floor (Mitchell wasn't there). That's when Frank and I called Mitch and said, "OK, now you'd better get yourself over here; you've got to come and answer this attack." So Mitchell then came.  I don't know really why he was staying away. But he came, and he stood in the door. Henderson was attacking him, and so Mitch walked in and said, "I demand a chance to answer that charge." And Henderson said no; he said, "I'm asking you to leave" or Munro 55 something. And Mitch said, "Well all right, I' 11 go. But how many loyal members of the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union will go with me?" And so they all rose /laughter/. That was our trick; that was what we knew was going to happen, although we didn't know it would happen just like that. And old A.B. Bookins started singing "We Shall Not Be Moved," and they all marched out and left Henderson and his men standing on the platform without any convention. And that really was about the last, the end of that effort, I think.  I have some pictures in the office; in fact, I have some pictures of Mitchell standing outside of that union hall. But what the rights and the wrongs were politically and the whole thing, I'm really not sure I'd be adequate to judge.  I was too close to it. I was sure we were right then /laughter/, but whether we were right or not now I don't know. MF: Mitchell and Claude Williams were really at odds about what the whole thing of affiliation with                                . Were you so much on Mitchell's side that you couldn't see Claude Williams's argument? Or was there a coherent argument? Munro: I never heard any argument; I never really heard one. MF: What did you think of him? How did you react to him? Munro: I never was impressed with him at all; I never really trusted him at all, even before any of this. He was too ... he seemed to me to be a phony /laughter/, really.  I guess that* s a very simplified way of putting it. But all of this "brother in blood" sort of stuff and this over-emotional religiosity just . . . well, maybe wasn't my style, because I never had the slightest feeling that Claude Williams was for real. I used to watch him just wrap little old ladies in New York around his finger, Munro $4 because they all thought he was so marvelous. He'd go to get contributions. In fact, I think he one time had a fund called "Fund for the Support of the Reverend Claude C. Williams," or something like that /laughter/. But he just never was very . . . authentic, as far as I was concerned. MF: Did you ever see him at any of the meetings? Did he ever actually work as an organizer for the STFU? Munro: No, no. MF: Do you have any feeling for the way other people reacted to him, let' s say out in the field? Munro: Well, the only time, you know, that I really ever knew him to do anything was when he went to this funeral (and I guess he was invited to do that) and got beaten up. That was really the only time I had any real knowledge of him doing anything. And then there was that business about&#8212;and I never knew what really was the honest truth&#8212;how Butler found out that Williams was trying to take over the union /laughter/ with the Communist party, and all that business. But I took the minutes of the trial and wrote that up&#8212;which I have now forgotten, but I guess there's a copy of it in the archives somewhere. BEGIN SIDE I TAPE II MF: . . . reacted when that whole incident sort of broke? I mean, was it a revelation, or was it something that people had been expecting for a long time? Munro: No, I think it was a revelation. Butler really was a pretty upright guy, and I guess he really had been fooled. And he found out he' d been fooled. How he found out, whether the coat story was accurate or not I don't know. Munro 55 MF: Was that the story that you heard at the time? Munro: Oh yes, oh yes, the coat story /laughter/. MF: What about the relationship that the STFU had with Commonwealth all through this whole period? Munro: Well, it was not really very important or very close at all. Other than that short period when Dick Whitton was there, I don't think there really was a relationship. Later there was an unfortunate relationship. One time we stopped off there on a trip, and a guy took a shot at Mitchell /laughter/. But then that was something that never showed up in any. . , . We all hushed-hushed about that, because it wasn't one of the things that we or they would make public. MF: Did you know who it was or why he took the shot? Munro: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes; I even remember his name.  I don't know if it matters now or not. He was a former union member named Walter Moscop, who was a sort of disaffected one. And I don't really remember why or I didn't really know him. But apparently he felt strongly enough, or the feeling was that he had been made to feel since he' d been at Commonwealth that there was reason why Mitchell was his enemy or something. MF: Did you have the distinct feeling  at Commonwealth the STFU was under fire /laughter/ constantly? Munro: Yes, yes probably, except that we didn't have any feeling constantly because we weren't involved with it. It just was something over there. The time we went it was really kind of funny, because we had a New Yorker with us who was from the Workers' Defense League, Sidney Hertzberg, a writer. And we really gave him the works that time /laughter/; he really Munro 56 didn't think things like that really happened. Here we were at Commonwealth. . . . MF: Were you actually visiting on the campus; I mean, you were sitting at a meeting or something and this guy came up with a gun? Munro: Oh yes, oh yes, we were there. No, Mitch went over to visit the guy. He went when he heard that he had some problems with him, and he went over to talk to him about it. Walked in his house, and the guy said something ("Just a minute," or something) and went and got his gun, and came out /laughter/ with his gun. I don't know whether he actually shot and missed, but Mitchell didn't wait. He turned around and ran; and the first thing we knew he showed up running. He said, "Get   the car; we've got to get out of here*." /laughter/ MF: You didn't stay around long enough to see how other people at Commonwealth reacted to it? /laughter/ Munro: No, I think we left. As a matter of fact, Covington Hall was there then too; you know, the old Socialist poet? Have you ever run was into anything by Covington Hall? He was a real old-timer; I / glad I got a chance to meet him. He was there then too. MF: The other thing that is sort of in the story that Mitchell kept being attacked about&#8212;or not "kept being," but occasionally was attacked about&#8212;was E.B. McKinney, who at the time, I think, was into Garveyism to a certain extent and into black separatism? Munro: Yes, he was; that's right, he was. MF: You talked about it as being completely racially integrated. How did that. . . ? Munro: Well, McKinney was sort of not much there when I was there. Munro 57 I guess he had been there earlier. He must have been, because I remember knowing him and being impressed with his ability. But I think he sort of moved out, because it is true: I know he was into the Marcus Garvey thing. But I was thinking more in terms of people like Benton and other like men in the union. MF: So McKinney and his Garveyism was sort of an aberration rather than the rule? Munro: Yes, I don't think it really ever was important as far as the union was concerned. MF: Who was the person you called "Little Boy"? Munro: Oh, "Little Boy" is Mitchell's little brother&#8212;not little brother, younger brother Edwin Mitchell. He was always known as "Little Boy;" that was /laughter/ his nickname. He used to show up. He went to__ what was it, Brookfield? Was that the name of it? MF: Brookwood? Munro: Brookwood, yes, yes; it must be. He'd show up and come and help. And he had a sort of ... oh, I guess a crush on me, you know; he thought I was marvelous. "Little Boy" was just "Little Boy." As a matter of fact, he' s living in Mexico now.  It' s sort of strange to see him. He stopped by here a couple of summers ago. /laughter/ He's still "Little Boy;" he's a sort of combed old little boy /laughter/. MF: Were he and Mitchell close at all? Munro: Yes, quite close. MF: I wondered if you had any contact with or feeling about the way the wives of sharecroppers were reacting to the union? Did you ever have any contact with them? Munro 58 Munro: Well yes, I had. There was a women's auxilliary, and I was involved in that. I was the women's organizer or something. I'd really like to look into that more myself. MF: I'd never heard that there was a women's auxilliary /laughter/. Munro: Yes, I ran that for a while. We had meetings just for women, and there were some pretty strong women in that, sharecropper women.  In fact, there were women who took a lot of leadership in the union too; there weren't just men. MF: Who were some of those? Do you remember? Munro: Well, one was Henrietta McGee, a name that I somehow come up with. I just don't remember their names, but oh yes, MF: Do you remember a woman named Myrtle Lawrence? Munro: Yes, I remember Myrtle Lawrence. MF: Now were these people close enough to Memphis that you could be in touch with them on a sort of regular basis? Munro: Yes, yes. Well, they wrote or they came in, or we went out to see them at meetings. Yes. MF: When you said they took leadership roles in the union, what kinds of things. . . ? Did they do anything in particular that you remember? Munro: Well, they organized. They used to get up and make speeches. They used to make motions. You know, they participated. They held office, I think. We certainly sent them on trips to New York, to tell the story. That's one thing they did, and they did very, very well. I know Myrtle Lawrence did that, and I think Henrietta McGee did, and there were others. Those names I really don't remember, but there were certainly women who were Munro 59 active. And somewhere there ought to be some letters, because I know that I had this women's group. MP: In that women's group did you talk specifically about. . . . Munro: I'm just trying to remember who the heck they were. Tried to raise money for the union? I'm not quite sure. Maybe I can find some clues to it somewhere; I don't know. MF: What about children's programs? Was there anything for children? Munro: I don't remember doing that; I don't believe so. MF: Do you remember, you mentioned a photographer you traveled with at one time? Munro: Yes, Russell Lee was one. MF: Do you remember the work of the others who were coming out at that time, especially after the Farm Security Administration had been started? James Agee or Rockwell Evans? Munro: Well, I know them now; I didn't know them then. MF: I wondered if you knew them then. Munro: No, I didn't know them then.  I did know Russell Lee then, and who else? I particularly remember Russell Lee because I made a trip with him. MF: Did you make the trip with him because you were interested in the cooperative? Munro: No, because I wanted to go to New Orleans /laughter/, and he was going there; that' s why I made the trip with him. I got a ride. There were certainly other people who did important things, but I can't recall them right now. MF: Do you remember a fellow named Leon Turner? Munro 40 Munro: Yes, I remember the name but I don't really remember him. MF: What was your feeling about the whole issue of the CIO affiliate, the decision to affiliate with the CIO? Did you ever participate in that decision? Munro: No, I didn't; no, I didn't go to the convention and I didn't participate. MF: Did you ever have any feeling about whether it had been /laughter/ the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do? Munro: Well, I think I had the feeling that it was the wrong thing to do, just because we got ourselves into a bind, that we were no longer autonomous. Sure, I think it was the wrong thing to do; but maybe it was the only thing to do. MF: Right. Did you have any feeling about organized labor at that time? Munro: Well, I guess I thought the CIO was great; I certainly was for the CIO. But it was just that we were in the unfortunate situation of having to come in and be controlled /laughter/ by a group whose motivations were questionable, so it seemed. What about the whole idea of MF: /even if you had not had to come in under UOAPAWA, but had been able to come in as an autonomous organization? Munro: I don't know; it might still have been difficult, because this was so much almost a religious movement and so close to the land. Then yet, I don't know. I remember some of the preachers and the union organizers getting up and talking about the C.I. and C. /laughter/; you know, they would have, could have gone along with it. But it was just a new thing to have to understand, I think. Munro 4l MF: Did you ever handle any of the problems with Otis Sweden in Oklahoma /laughter/? Munro: Oh, I knew Otis Sweden. I knew him, but I don't think I handled any problems. I think the problems came about later, maybe after I left even. He was ... an interesting character: hard-bitten tough guy with a marvelous vocabulary. I really enjoyed listening to him. /laughter/ I' d never heard anything like it. He was a really tough guy. No, I don't really even remember the situation, MF: After the 1958 convention, I guess it was, or after 1958 Hester sort of left and went elsewhere, and Mitchell started working for the National Youth Authority part-time. Munro: That's when I went to the University of Mississippi. MF: That's when you left to go. So was Butler the only one left in the office? Munro: Yes, that's right. MF: And were you ever there with him alone during that time? Munro: I don't remember being. MF: So you all sort of left at basically the same time? Munro: Yes, yes. MF: Do you remember the Missouri highway demonstration during 1958? Munro: Oh sure. MF: Did you ever go there? Munro: Oh yes, yes I did, but I can't /laughter/ really remember any incidents. I remember having something to do with getting Eleanor Roosevelt to send things. She sent . . . what did she send: money for tents, or money for something or other? Yes, we were all pretty involved in that. Munro 42 MF: Do you remember the role that Owen Whitfield played? Munro: Owen Whitfield: yes. You know, I've kind of forgotten that, because Whitfield was a very strong and important guy, and a very persuasive and able orator. You know, he was one of those with the preacher background, and apparently was. . . . Whether he was bought or whether he really ideologically went along with the Henderson group, he did become their man. That's /laughter/ sort of all that I remember about that. MF: It's hard to understand the relationship between the Henderson group and the STFU group in sort of trying to hold on to people.  Is that exactly how it was? Munro: Yes, yes, I think that's how it was. Well, you know, if you can get an important person to be on your side you have more chance of influencing others, if what you're trying to do is get power. And the Henderson group was trying to. . . . When we withdrew from the CIO they certainly were trying to organize that group. They wanted it. And it was also pretty much, I think, the old "rule or destroy," which has always been the Communist tactic; there was a lot of that involved. MF: How did you see the whole issue&#8212;it sounds so mundane /laughter/ to say it&#8212;of dues? Didn't the UOAPAWA group want to get more money than the STFU? Munro: Yes, yes, and there never was any money /laughter/ really. They really never paid any dues to speak of; you know, they' d pay dues and they'd. . . . But I think the thing existed through contributions from well-wishers; I don't think it could ever have made it if it really existed on dues. MF: Right. Do you think that that's one thing that made. . . ? Munro 45 Did you at the time have any feeling about the relationship that the STFU had to organized labor? Munrot Yes. We probably could never have practically become a . . . bureaucracy of /laughter/ any kind; we really couldn't have. It just wasn't that kind of thing. It was a movement rather than an organization. MF: Toward the very end, didn't Gardner Jackson go over to UOAPAWA's side, or to Henderson's side? Munro1 I don't think so, no; I'm sure he didn't. MF: So you remember having his support right through to the very end? Munro: Oh yes, yes. MF: When you went to the University of Mississippi you attended for one semester as a special student. Munro: Yes. MF: And then you were still officially with the union? Munroj Yes, I think so, I wasn't getting any pay or anything like that, but my loyalties were still there. But there wasn't any money at all, and obviously I had to make a living somewhere. MF: How did you happen to go to the University of Mississippi? Munro* Well, that was because I went to the Quaker work camp. And a couple of years later Mike Yarrow, who was a Quaker, came to visit the office of the STFU. He had just gotten a job as a teacher in&#8212;what was it? Philosophy he taught, I think, at the University of Mississippi. He dropped in the office because he knew I had been in a Quaker work camp and also wanted to meet people. I met him and we immediately liked each other. He immediately said, "Look, you've got to come and have lunch with us and meet my wife Margaret." I did. And then I went down to visit them and had Munro 44 dinner with them. And somehow it just happened that we really became very close very quickly. They lent me the money and offered me their home to come and go to school&#8212;and after I' d known them /laughter/ about a month! And I did. I was with them when their first son was born, and we are still very close. As a matter of fact, I had a call from Mike just a few months ago. They were on their way to Hawaii, where they are managing a Quaker center in Honolulu. They have since also made the Quaker witness in Ireland, in the very worst area /laughter/. And he was international secretary to the Friends' Service Committee in New York. So we continue to be friends throughout the years. But that's how I happened to go to Mississippi. MF: Would you explain a little bit about the Quaker work camp? Munro: Well, during that period the American Friends' Service Committee had college summer work camps for college students from different parts of the country. And there were different work camps in different ideas, the idea being that students would pay to come and live in a situation like the co-op farm and work with people . , . for, however you say it, a period of some sort of social change. They could learn about the situation by working with the people on a mutual project. That's what the work camp was. So I went on a scholarship. There were about&#8212;let's see, I have the log of that work camp; somehow or other I hung onto it. Somebody wrote it at the end. There were about six theological students, boys, and there were various girls from different schools, and myself. We had meetings. The director was a guy named Buck Shots /laughter/, actually, from Chicago at Northwestern. We had regular Quaker silence meeting for worship every Munro 4$ morning. We did all the cooking; we did all the washing. The girls (because at that time we were somewhat segregated) had a school for the farm children. The boys built a road. We all worked. Some of the girls worked on shingling a house; they did get into that. Then we had meetings every night with local planters, with local students from the area, with, you know, various groups of people, the idea being to try to understand the whole situation. We went to local churches, to the black churches and white churches, and visited union meetings and those kind of things. MF: Did most of the people who came come from the South? Munroj No, most of them didn't. I don't know whether any of them came from the South. MF* Was this when Constance Rumba1 was there?                                     * " Munro: She wasn't involved with the work camp. She just happened to be visiting the farm at that time. I probably was the only one from the South. No, I wasn't. Margery Johnson, the sister of Josephine Johnson who wrote Our November, she was a member of that work camp, and we were very good friends. MF: How did you respond to the whole idea of participating in this kind of thing? Munro: Well, it was the best summer I ever spent in my life /laughter/; I loved it. MF: /laughter/ Why did you like it so much? Munro: Well, because there was interchange of intellectual things. There was a certain kind of religious fervor. Mostly because I hadn' t been exactly with my peers for a while, and these were young people my age who were idealistic and intelligent. Oh, they sang a lot. And I had a Munro 46 kind of a romance with one of the students. It was a great summer. MF: How did the other students react? Were they as enthusiastic as you were? Munro: Oh yes, oh yes; it was a marvelous thing. MF: What was the experience that you had the semester at Mississippi? Munro: Well, that was pretty good. I took only senior courses, actually. I took a course in ethics and I took a course in minority people (sociology). I had an English course; I've forgotten which period it was. That was pure gravy, because I liked poetry anyway. The only thing I didn't get an "A" in was Joe Matthews' s course in history /laughter/, because I really couldn't fudge on that and couldn't use information I had already in any way. Well, I couldn't have on the ethics course either, but that one I really was interested in and really worked on it. But with Joe, Joe's exam came about around the same time as the Yarrow*s baby and the Matthews' s baby /laughter/, and I was kind of busy babysitting, and being much more interested in the babies than I was in the history. So I got a "B" in Joe's class. But that was a very pleasant experience. In fact a young philosophy teacher I went bike riding with. It once again was a situation in the sense that now I am old enough to be the mother of a lot of my teachers /laughter/ and faculty members. There at least I was older than the average undergraduate, and so I was on a more equal basis with the faculty. I didn't have very many friends among the students, but I did have friends among the faculty. MF: Did you ever plan to stay on? Munro: No, it just didn't occur to me; I'm not quite sure why. /laughter/ It just didn't. Well, I was still pretty much involved in the Munro 47 Socialist party and the union activities, so when Frank gave me the word that I could have this job organizing in Knoxville, Tennessee I just automatically took it. MF: And you went to organize for the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union in Knoxville, and headed an organizing drive? Munro: Yes, I headed the organizing drive. I had two organizers under me. I&#171; d never been in a garment mill in my life /laughter/. But fortunately one of the women, Agnes Rivers, was a really marvelous older woman. MF: What was her name? Munro: Agnes Rivers. I have a picture of her as a hard-bitten, lean, scrawny mountaineering-type woman whose husband used to beat her up every Saturday night. She took me under her wing MF: She was one of the women working under you? Munro: Yes, she the organizer. I did organize a few mills, the Standard and the Appalachian mills, and brought them out on strike. We had a very successful picket line at, I guess it was, the Appalachian mills, because I always had public relations sense and have always gotten along very well with reporters /laughter/&#8212;at least I did at that time. So I sort of tipped them off, and we were all in cahoots about my picket line. So they were all ready with cameras. I made Time magazine, as a matter of fact, because I had the pickets wear the underwear, the underwear that they made /laughter/. I' 11 show you a picture of it. They wore signs saying "I lost my pants at the Appalachian mills." They loved it and the press loved it; and it was a very successful agreement. Munro 48 Also the day of the strike, the day the workers came out, we had a bit of a drama. It turned out to be in our favor, but it could have been just the opposite. One of our leading women and strongest union members, who really worked for the strike and for the organization, was murdered the morning of the strike that they were to come out* a shotgun murder by a lover&#8212;or by her husband, that's right. He murdered her and her lover, and spattered them all over the bedroom. It' s really incredible, /laughter/ the things that went on. That was really, really a rugged situation. But we didn't know, should we just call the whole thing off? What should we do? And then they said, "No, we should go on." I remember standing outside by a little restaurant where there was a telephone, waiting to see what would happen and seeing those workers all come out of the mill. I rushed to the phone and called my friends on the papers /laughter/ and said, "OK." MF: This was not at all a spontaneous sort of strike. It was very much planned? Munro: Oh yes, it was planned. It was an organized strike. They had asked for everything. And once again, the day that they walked out they tried again and couldn't get anywhere; and so they walked out. MF* How did people react to you being in the town? Did you have any trouble staying in town? Where did you live? Munro: No, not in Knoxville, no. I had an apartment, and then a little later I had a nice little house. My mother came and stayed with me for a while. No, Memphis was more difficult than Knoxville; Knoxville wasn't. MF: Why do you think it wasn't? Munro 49 Munro: Well, I don't know. There probably was just a difference in the communities. Maybe Knoxville was a more liberal community. Cromp v was running Memphis when I was there, and the police were pretty . . . (what's the word I want?) well, active /laughter/. MF: How long did the picket line last? Munro: I don't remember, but several days at least. I don't know whether it was a week or what; I just don't remember. Negotiations were going on. And oh, I remember making my first speeches during that time, public speeches. In fact, I remember the first public speech I ever made was when I was with the union. I went back after the first strike. I went back to New Orleans, and I had to go and make a talk about just it. And I was actually so nervous that l/couldn't stand up, so I sat down /laughter/ and made the speech sitting down /laughter/. But I did learn to get up and talk during that Knoxville situation. MF: How many of the workers were women in the mill? Munro: Oh, a large number were women in Knoxville. There were both, but I know there were a great many women. And we used to do things. Part of the activities was having box suppers, for example. And the women would bake pies and we'd have socials: very much the kind of thing you would expect a mountaineering community to do. And they'd bid on the box dinners. It was successful as a social organization as well as a trade union. And I don't know what happened after I left. MF* Were you one of few organizers for ILG who were women? Had they tried to send anyone else in before to that particular strike&#8212;I mean, to that particular mill? Munro: Not that I know of. Munro 50 MF: You stayed in the community for almost a year then? Munro: Yes. MF* And they eventually settled the strike? Munro: Yes; they went back. MF: Were you happy with the settlement? Munro: No, I wasn't /laughter/. I don't remember why, but I didn't feel that the workers got what they should have gotten out of it. I felt there were too many compromises made. There too, I may have been wrong, you know; as I look at it now I might not feel that way. But at that time I felt that they compromised the workers' positions, and I was very, very. ... In fact, I was so unhappy and so upset that night, I remember I wouldn't go out to dinner with the organizers and the manager. I went back to my hotel room and wept, because I felt they had let the workers down. And then I was transferred to another town; and I decided it just wasn't for me, so I quit. MF* Did anyone else feel the same way you did after the settlement? Anyone else in the union? Munro* I don't know /laughter/; I don't remember. I only remember how I felt. MF: When you decided to quit, did you have feelings about that particular union or that particular strike, or all organized labor? Munro: Oh no, I just felt maybe about that particular union manager. You know, I don't think I felt the ILG was a bad union; I knew it was a good union. It really was a good union. But I just felt that I had led these people to this point and promised them a lot of things and hadn't delivered. Munro 51 MF: Who was the union manager? Munro: His name was John Martin; he was the guy who settled it. He was a regional director. MF* And he came in to do the negotiating? Munro* He had to do the negotiating, yes. I just got the strike successful and got the people organized. MF* Did you know anything else about him? Munro* No, no, not really. Well, ltd worked with him; I'd met him and I knew he was experienced, /interruption/ MF* I wanted to start with a couple of things. We've gotten up to about 1940 or ' 4l, and I wanted to back up just a little bit and ask a few things that we didn't talk about. One was, I wondered what contact you had with the National Sharecroppers' Fund when you were working for the STFU? Munro* Well, it didn't even exist in the beginning, and it was something that was set up (I've forgotten which year) when we were trying to raise money in New York. Mitch has always been very good at organizing fundraising sort of things, and I imagine he and Harriet Young and the Socialist and liberal friends In New York formed the organization. I never had any particular contact with it. Do you know when it began? MF: I don't know the year when it first started. Munro: As it's now constituted it has very little to do with what it was, I think, in the early days&#8212;if it's still alive, and I presume it still is, isn't it? MF: Did you go to National Sharecroppers' Week ever? Munro* No, never. That was sort of for easterners and fundraising Munro 52 purposes. I went to New York once or twice in those early days, but not for a Sharecroppers' Week, /interruption/ MF* I wondered if you had any contact with Highlander Foil School? Munro* No, also very little. I knew the people, but I was only there once. We stopped off on a trip from somewhere else and spent an evening singing with Miles Horton and the rest of them, singing labor songs. But I had no connection with it, no. MF* Did you ever arrange to send sharecroppers to Highlander for any kind of training? Munro* No, not that I know of. MF: Did you ever hear about the Southern School for Workers? Munro: I don't remember ever hearing of it. MF: Or Louise McLaren? Munro: No, Ho. MF* Did you ever know or work with a woman named Elizabeth Rogers? Munro* No, no. MF: I wondered if you had any interest in or ever participated in the Southern Conference for Human Welfare. Munro* Yes, that I did* the first one and, I believe, the second one. MF* You went to the first convention in Birmingham in I958? Munro* I went to the first one; yes, yes, that's correct. I'm sure I get them mixed up. I went to that one, and I went to the one that was in Nashville, wasn't it? Isn't that where the second one was? I seem to remember that one most vividly, because at one of them (I've forgotten which one) the segregation law was enforced. Do you know about that? Munro 55 MF* Well, the first one in Birmingham in 1958 was when people were sitting on different sides of the aisle, and Mrs. Roosevelt came. Munro* Yes, yes, that was the one. Yes, I remember that one; I was there. MF: Bo Carter, the policeman, was involved. Munro* Yes, I remember that very well. As a matter of fact, that was the one that. . . . Marian Anderson sang at a concert that evening, or one of those evenings, and Frank McCallister and I vent while she was singing to the top of the concert hall and unhooked the ropes&#8212;slaughter/ I remember that very well&#8212;that divided the /laughter/ group, the blacks from the whites, and just let them slide down. This small escapade marks that bit of history for me. MF* /laughter/ Did anyone notice that you were doing this? Munro* I don't know whether they did or not; we just did it. It made us feel better /laughter/. MF* Do you remember your feeling about going to that convention, and the idea of setting up that kind of an organization in the South? Were you optimistic about it? Munro: Oh, I was optimistic, because I'm by nature /laughter/ optimistic. I think I was then. But I also realized shortly after getting there how absolutely frustrating the whole thing was because of the great division. And it just turned out to be a big fight between the . . . well, the Communists and the non-Communists /laughter/. We spent all the time, it seemed to me, trying to keep the Communists from taking an international position, which was always what seemed to be happening. It really had little relevance to the problems of the sharecroppers or Munro 54 anybody else, we felt, specifically in the South, because it was always on some international issue that we got hung up. MF: Did you and the Socialist party people you were very close to have a feeling, at least in the beginning, of being able to work with Communists within that organization? Or was there some sort of stand-offishness? Munro: Yes, I think that there was a period of united front, and I think there was a certain mutual respect with some of the people in the Alabama Sharecroppers' Union. I remember one young man particularly (/laughter/ right now I can't think of his name) that seemed to be simply doing an honest bit of work, with probably the same motivation and the same goals. But whenever there were meetings, there seemed to be, you know, the same problems that made it pretty difficult, because it always ended up that the Communists were trying to take control and other people tried to keep them from taking control on some issue (a political issue rather than a social issue). MF: Do you remember being concerned about Communists or individual Communists or Communist groups taking control of different organizations? Munro: I wasn't concerned about it; we just kept getting into these situations. You know, it was simply a bit of . . . well, it was the facts of life /laughter/. You just found out that it happened, I'm sure I wasn't aware at all, so I wouldn't have been concerned about it until it happened, until I was there and saw it happening. As I mentioned, I think, when we were talking before, this young Communist organizer came to Memphis, just sort of showed up at the YMOA and dropped into the office and got involved in things that I was doing. At that time one of the side things Munro 55 that I was doing, in addition to working for the union, I organized a forum, because people came to town. I don't know how long that lasted or when I started it. But rather interesting and important people came through Memphis very often, because we had been in the public eye; they came to the union office and so I knew they were there. And I got in the habit, if they were going to be around for a while, of having a meeting. We had a sort of Socialist forum or something of the kind, public meetings. This young man also went to those and was active. But he actually told me (because his assignment apparently just didn't quite work) that one of his assignments was to get union information through me by dating me. He had been trained /laughter/ by the Communist party; this was one of his jobs. MF: Did you ever have the feeling that. . . ? BEGIN SIDE II TAPE II Munro: ... may have, but I really have no personal experience of it. Somehow the people that I knew and worked with were just not trained in the devious manner /laughter/. I don't know how this happened. MF: The Communist groups in the South certainly had the reputation for that kind of behavior, that kind of working within groups, and even trying to take control of or destroy different groups. Munro: I never knew of any Socialist organization going into a known Communist group and trying to take it over; I never did, not in my personal experience. MF: Did you ever meet anyone in the South at this time who belonged to the Communist party who was very disillusioned with it? Was there as much switching of sides or dropping of membership because of these kinds Munro 56 of incidents? Munro: I don't recall any. I certainly was very friendly with some people. There was an old tailor in Memphis who made me a suit, and his name was Farber. I enjoyed him very much. He was an old Communist, but certainly he was more my kind of person /laughter/, I guess, than the Communists who were coming in to organize. In fact, he contributed to the support of this boy Spradling, the young Communist who was in Memphis. This kid was so naive that he kept a notebook, and he kept a list of all the people who contributed. And he also kept a map with red pins /laughter/ stuck in it. And when he was picked up, as he inevitably was, by Chief Lee (I believe he was chief of police in Memphis, and he was pretty tough) . . &#8226; . Well, I hadn't heard from him for several days, and since he always called me or came by the office I realized something must have happened to him. And I couldn't reach him at his room at the "Y", so I called one of my friends on the newspaper and told him that I thought perhaps something had happened. He said he' d go nosing around the jail and look at the police blotters and see. He called me back, and within an hour or so after he began to investigate the kid was allowed to use the phone. But he had been kept for about a week without being allowed to call anyone or to call a lawyer until somebody found out that he was there. MF* What had he been arrested on? Munro; Vagrancy, although he had a room at the "Y" for which he was paying. But this was one of the things that MF: Was this pretty commonly done? Munro* Yes, I think it was commonly done. Munro 57 MF: Were Communists arrested? Socialists were Munro* This I don't know. But I know that that was a charge. And he had /laughter/, of course, his little notebook. Farber the tailor an made the policemen's uniforms, so it was /laughter/ sort of/embarrassing situation for him. I don't really remember the outcome of it, except that we eventually got the boy out of jail. He was out working on a rock pile. I went out to see him&#8212;the first time I had ever been anywhere near a prison, so I can remember that rather vividly. I took him some cigarettes and talked to him through the bars or whatever /laughter/ the setup they had, which was an experience. And then we tried to get his people to do something about it. They said, "No, he got himself into this; he can stay there." So I think Harriet Young who, as I mentioned, was a rather wealthy girl and Barbara Howse, who is now a poet. . . . MF: Howse? Munro* Howse* H-o-w-z-e or s-e. She was another girl who came to Memphis to do these things. Mitchell was in touch with her. She would have a story too. And it was either Harriet or Barbara who sent the money to get him out of jail. And we paid the fine or bail, or whatever it was, got him out&#8212;I suppose it was bail&#8212;and then drove him out of town so he could get away before they picked him up again. That was the last of that young man /laughter/. MF* Did you keep up with those Southern Conferences-^pa&amp;t the first two conventions? Did you follow it? Munro: No, no, that's all, the only two that I remember. MF: Did you not follow it because of all the splits that had occurred? Munro: Well, what were the years now? If I knew the years I'd know Munro 58 better what was happening to me. MF* Well, the first convention was in ' 58, and then I think the next one was early in '40. Munro: &#171;40. Well, you see, I left shortly around that time, so x ..                                                              ILGWU that's why I wouldn't have. And the / was certainly not involved in it; and it was around that time, I imagine, that I was working in Knoxville. Mr* But it wasn't an organization that you had enough hope or interest in? Munro: No, we simply went. No, we simply went as a group. The liberals and radicals involved in the union went because it was where others were congregating, with the idea that something might come of it. And I think that there was some disillusionment, although I didn't continue because I wasn't there. I think there was a feeling that it wasn't going to be able to work because of fractionalism/factionalism, both /laughter/. MF: In 194l, then, you spent the semester at Mississippi and then went to work for the ILG in Tennessee. Munro: Yes. MF: I was wondering if at the time you took the job, left Mississippi and took the job with the ILG you sort of planned eventually to return to work with the STFU if things got better, or did you think that the split within UOAPAWA and the kinds of problems that the STFU was having at that time could be resolved in any way? Munro* Strangely enough, I don't remember feeling that I would ever go back, but I don't remember having any reason for that. I think that I somehow made the transition when I was in Mississippi at the University of Munro 59 Mississippi, so that I was not as intimately involved, although I still had my own personal motivation the same. It was like I was just moving from one cause or one group of people that I was concerned with /laughter/ to another. MF: So you definitely wanted to keep either working with Socialist projects or the labor movement? Munro: Yes, yes, right. And although I wasn't there long enough, and perhaps because I was alone and didn't have the sort of intimate relationship. ... I didn't gain the intimate relationship with those people that I did in the other area because&#8212;how to put it?&#8212;my immediate supervisor was simply an organizer. MF* This was Martin? Munro: This was Martin. He was an organizer, and a good one and a successful one, I presume. But he never was close to people, so the closeness that I got to the actual workers in the mill I had to do alone. Whereas with the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union all the people who we worked with were of the group itself; they weren't outsiders. I was an outsider in Knoxville, as I had been in Memphis. But at least in Memphis I was accepted because the other people were not, and I was working eltosely with the people who were really involved. In Knoxville I had one organizer who also was sent from some other area to work under me, and I was fortunate in having one woman who came out of the mill and of the Tennessee hills, a woman named Agnes Rivers. I don't even remember the other's name; /laughter/ you can see why that is. But Agnes Rivers was sort of tall. I have a picture of her with me on a picket line, a tall, raw-boned, older woman who sort of took me under her wing even though I was her supervisor. Munro 60 I was pretty good at planning organizational techniques and tactics and publicity, but she told me what it was like /laughter/ to work in a mill, and things I really needed to know. I was very close to her. But certainly the relationship was never quite the same as it was at the sharecroppers' organization. MF: Was one of the main differences in going from working with the STFU to working for the ILG the absence of what you've outlined in your fifth chapter: "Let Justice Flow as Waters and Righteousness as a Running Stream," the whole religious aspect of the movement? Munro: Well no, that may have been part of it, but I'm sure that there was an aspect of that there with the workers if I'd been able to get close enough to the workers. But there was not an aspect of that in the people who were organizing it. I think the difference was thattthe ILG was a professional organization with paid organizers&#8212;and this is in no way detracting from it, because I think it's one of the best organizations, was and is. But it is true that it didn't have that fervor of personal committment that the STFU had. So that is, in a sense, a religious kind    ) of fervor. I didn't feel that any of the other people that I worked with had that kind of committment. MF: Did you have any desire at this time to ever go back and work the with sharecroppers or migrant workers in particular? Munro: No, I guess I always adapt to where I am and start thinking about future /laughter/ rather than past. I did at one time get a letter from       Smith (I don't know where I was then; I was out of the South) saying that she wished . . . that she thought that this was a loss, and that southerners who felt as I did should come back /laughter/ and Munro 6l should stay there. And I admitted to that, but somehow fate had moved me on into another situation and continued to move me. MF* Well then, after you organized the Standard and Appalachian mills, the ILG transferred you? Munro: They transferred me to some little town; I don't know whether it was in Tennessee or Alabama. I simply don't remember where it was. But I was disenchanted by then; I was disenchanted somehow by what I felt was a somewhat unfair settlement. It may have been the only one possible; that I don't know. I was not entirely practical or knowledgable about such things as settling contracts. MF; You said you weren't involved in the negotiations yourself? Munro: No, I was not involved in the negotiations. There was a NLRB election at one of the mills, and we did win. But then the negotiations and the settlement of the strike I was not at all involved in. I think organizers never were; this was something managers and lawyers did, /laughter/ which had something to do with my problems, I think. MF* Did you have any feeling about the whole role or lifestyle that you would have to lead as an organizer? Munro: Well, this was part of it. I didn't have any feeling about it in Knoxville, but when I went into this little town and sort of was supposed to spy /laughter/ more or less, to just sort of be around and talk to people without having any real role. . . . MF: Kind of feel out the whole situation? Is that what you were doing? Munro* Yes, that lifestyle didn't particularly appeal to me* sitting around hotel lobbies /laughter/. Munro 62 MF: Were you by yourself? Munro: I was by myself, yes, in a strange community. And I just resigned and went to New York by way of Washington. I'm never any good at dates or at figures, or ages or numbers of any kind, but I know that at that time it was the time of the last big meeting of the Keep America out of War Congress in Washington, and I arrived in Washington in time for that. I went to those meetings. It just happened, Dave and I found out some years later,that although we didn't know each other we were both there, and certainly at one time in the same room /laughter/ for one of the meetings. I had a lot of friends, because I had been active in Knoxville;when I was doing the ILG one of the things that I also was involved in was organizing Keep America Out of War Committee, the Knoxville committee. And I certainly maintained. ... A lot of the same people who were involved with the STFU as supporters were also in the anti-war movement as well, and so I had many friends who were also there&#8212; and certainly the people from New York like the Hertzbergs (or like by Sidney; I don't know whether he was married to Hazel Whitman/then or not), and Socialists in Washington whom I knew well. And a girl who I had met through the Fellowship of Reconciliation (which is another organization that I was active in in Memphis during the STFU days&#8212;there are all these overlaps), Oeraldine Roche, who had been a student and then a teacher in Memphis, married Nelson Foote, who is a Cornell sociologist. I went from the Keep America Out of War Congress to Ithaca with Nelson and Geraldine for a few weeks after that meeting, MF: What impression did that meeting have on you? Munro: How can I look back and say what impression it had on me? Munro 65 It was exciting; it was wonderful. I have a picture taken on a beautiful sunny day, sitting on the wall of the Washington Monument /laughter/. I suppose there's always an exhileration in trying to do anything, whether it' s going to succeed or not, MF: This was the last conference that that group had? Munro: Yes. It was a huge one. So far as I know it was the last one, but it was a very large one. Many people came to Washington to participate in this. MF: We don't know the date of that meeting, but if it was in late &#8226;40 or '4l things started happening very rapidly. What was your reaction as we got heavily involved in the war? Munro: You know, anything I said now would be an embroidering. I don't know what my reaction was then. MF: I mean, did you oppose the war throughout the whole thing, or did you come to support it? Munro: Oh no, oh no; yes, I opposed the war throughout the whole thing, yes. No, I didn't change; I didn't switch. MF: That's what I was wondering about /laughter/. Munro: /laughter/ I didn't know what kind of emotional response. . . . MF; When the bombs started falling I know a lot of people switched /laughter/. Munro; . . . you were trying to evoke, and I don't remember that. Oh no, I didn't switch. MF: Were there any organizations that you worked through during the war to try to call for a settlement? Munro: I'll have to stop and think about that. I certainly maintained Munro 64 a connection with . . . well, I began an association with Quakers at the University of Mississippi. I guess I didn't mention that, which is really important. I did mention that I lived with Mike and Margaret Yarrow, and Mike was a Quaker. See, I began my first association with Quakers through the American Friends Service Committee, and it was really the first organization religious/I had encountered that I really didn't have any questions about. Or, at least the only question I had about it was whether I was good enough to be one; and /laughter/ I still have that question. But that really was a fairly important group, and continued to be. The Fellowship of Reconciliation I was active in in various places at various times, even after my first two children were born. I also continued some relationship with the Yarrows, and Mike Yarrow later was the head of the Oivilian Public Service camp for conscientious objectors in California, right outside of but Los Angeles. And so I not only visited there a lot,/I used to date 00' s rather regularly when I worked for the International anal Ladies Garment Workers' Union in Los Angeles. Another girl and I used to regularly spend weekends at the Civilian Public Service camp. There somehow was no question which side I was on; in fact, there has sort of seldom been a question which side I was on /laughter/. I just naturally have been on the anti-war, the underdog, ... emotionally. It's too bad you missed the Cesar Chavez meeting the night before last, which I stayed for on campus. And as I told him, I really came just to get recharged, because that is what he does for me. And I seem to need those kinds of personal contacts and relationships to . . . keep me /laughter/ sort of charged. MF: Well, when you left Washington after this conference and went up to New York and stayed at Cornell for a while, then you went to New Munro 65 York City? Munro: Then I went to New York City. MF: How did you decide to go to New York? This was the first time you had lived outside of the South? Munro: Yes, yes. Well, New York seemed to . . . you know, I seemed to be on the way /laughter/. I' d left New Orleans and I'd been to Memphis (and it was closer) and to Washington. I think by that time my brother was also in New York, in Long Island, so it was perhaps not as extreme as it might otherwise have been. And I did have other friends in New York. And as a Socialist party member theme were always living room was couches I could sleep on. And that, incidentally, was something that/a really very good and important part of that whole movement, and I doubt that it exists today (it may exist; I think probably it does in the Quaker groups somewhat). But there was a sort of ... I won't say network, because that's a wrong connotation, but there were just people that you could always telephone in any city you happened to be in and say, "Hey, I'm in town," or "I'm going to be in town; can you put me up?" And, you know, you were just accepted. No one would think of /laughter/ not doing that, without any sense of obligation because you'd do the same thing. So when I went to New York I stayed for a while with ... I don't know if you know James Lobe. Has his name turned up? MF: No. Munro: Jimmy Lobe was later the first president or director or whatever it was of the UDA, the Union for Democratic Action. That was sort of one of the first splits from the Socialist party. A few supporting other Democrats gathered simply around the Thomases. And Jimmy and Ellen Lobe Munro 66 had been contributors to the STFU. I used their living room couch for a while, and I also spent some time with the Romers&#8212;I don't know if that name's turned up; Sam and Edna Romer, R-o-m-e-r. Sam I had met the first time I ever went to New York, Sam and Edna Romer were just, , . , *n fact, I went to a party to send them off to Spain; he was going to fight for the loyalists in Spain, and she was going as a nurse. They were back, I suppose, /laughter/ by the time I arrived in New York, and I stayed with them for a while. And I volunteered (I.didn't have a job and nobody had a job). , . . I guess I checked in with the ILG and with Mark Star, who was the educational director, and there didn't seem to be. , , , Oh yes, they did offer me a job a little later; I forgot, I did get a job. But by the time I was offered the job I' d met Dave and I didn't want to leave the city, so I didn't take it. It was a union organizing job with the Garment Workers' Union in some garment worker area outside /laughter/ of New York; I've forgotten even where it was. But I volunteered to work in the office of the Workers' Defense League to begin with. I think I was getting paid a dollar a day, and I just did whatever needed to be done, which turned out to be press releases a lot of the time, the writing. I seem to always end up doing that sort of thing. I continued to do that, and then I was asked to go and do the Southern Intellectual Reform League job in&#8212;where was that, Knoxville? No, not Knoxville. MF: Richmond? Munro: Richmond, yes, Richmond, Virginia. MF: Did you decide that you could leave the city? Munro: Well, I decided I had to leave the city by then, because I Munro 67 was trying to break up /laughter/ with Dave. So that was part of that; I left deliberately because of the situation that was getting out of hand (it never had gotten out of hand), that and the fact that this seemed to be something nobody else was doing, and there was some money to do this particular thing. I really don't remember what I did except set up an organization, get out mailings and get people together. I met a few people, the only one of whom I really remember as being an exceptional person was Moss Plunkett. He was a lawyer in Virginia. MF: Was he also working for the Workers' Defense League? Munro: No, no, he was involved in the Southern Electoral Reform League and in other reforms in the South. But I think he had no connection with the Workers' Defense League. MF: But you had been sent down by the Workers' Defense League? Munro: That's right. They supplied the funds&#8212;or I presume they did, that somehow there was a connection. Or maybe I was offered it by a group that was connected; it was probably something of that kind. MF: How long were you there? Munro: I don't really remember how many months. It was a matter of months, certainly not years, because Dave started coming down on weekends and eventually prevailed on me to go back to New York. And at some time during this period, then, I was made assistant national secretary to the Workers' Defense League, and spent a lot of time in committee meetings and board meetings, and working on decisions about cases. And this Morris Milgram was then director of the Workers' Defense League; I just got a letter from him yesterday. MF: Were you directly under him and working directly with him? Munro 68 Munro: I was directly under Morris Milgram, yes. I didn't know whether I was going to be able to stand it, however, because he was the first non-southerner that I ever worked directly with. And Morris is not only Jewish and a New Yorker, but a very . . . well, dynamic. ... He really had a style unlike any that I had ever had anything to do with before, so early on I told him, "You know, you've got to say 'please* to me if you want me to do something, and you can't just direct me around, get lynched because people/in the South for doing that" /laughter/. MF: /laughter/ How did he react to that? Munro* Well, fine /laughter/. You know, he just wasn't aware of the                                                             , and we maintained friendship and /laughter/ I was able to work with him. During that time there were people who are now very prominent&#8212;oh, who is the writer? I guess I' 11 have to ask Dave to remind me; I can't think. He certainly did a book on this whole area. He was sort of my office boy; he's now a reporter or commentator; every now and then I hear him on radio for one of the New York newspapers. Murray Kempton: Murray was my office boy in New York in those days. MF: You said that you were involved in making decisions about cases and deciding policy and action that the Workers' Defense League was taking. Was this the most you had ever been involved in directing policy? Munro: Well, no, I was pretty much in in the STFU on decisions and influencing decisions and discussing other things that were possible, feasible, wise, honest /Taughter/. MF: How long did you work for the Workers' Defense League? Didn't you say they ran out of money? Munro: They ran out of money, yes, and I worked for them at the time Munro 69 that David Olendenin, who is really one of the fabulous people that somebody should do a book on (I only know little bits of pieces of Dave), . . . David Olendenin was heir to Olendenin fortune (I think that's steel), and he was a member of the Workers' Defense League, a Socialist. He was the sort of guy who went around (in those days when we were all poor) with fifty dollar shoes on, but got his clothes out of the box that had been sent to the sharecroppers, or had extra cars to give away. So he really tried to live a very simple life, and he gave everything he had away. At one time when he was in the South in Memphis he got word (he had driven down) that his father was ill, and he had to fly back. So he gave his car to one of the sharecropper organizers. Dave drove very, very fast. I once made a trip with him from Chapel Hill to New Orleans after an FOR conference, and drove faster than I have ever driven in my life&#8212;you know, like 80 miles an hour or more. We were all waiting in an executive board meeting in New York for Dave to arrive when we got word that he' d been killed in an automobile accident on his way from California to the meeting. And he died intestate, which meant that the money. ... You know, he didn*t leave anything for the Workers' Defense League, and he was one of the key supporters at that time, one of the principal supporters. And things were difficult financially, so I then took a job which, as I mentioned, is the only job up until that time where I'd ever worked for anything but causes: radical, liberal, Socialist, pacifist causes. I got a job at Columbia University in what turned out to be the Manhattan Project and the atom bomb. I got the job through a colleague from the time of the Keep America Out of War Congress in Knoxville, a young chemist named Clarence Hiskey who was a Munro 70 Communist /laughter/ as well. Somehow he had gotten cleared. He had been at the University of Tennessee and was now working on the Manhattan Project. He got me a job in the typing pool of the Project* And of course I had no idea what I was typing; I was just typing. And then within, oh, about two weeks I was transferred to the administrator's office, to the office of Dr. Harold Yuri, who was really one of the big scientists, and I was assistant to his secretary. One of my jobs was to lock up the parts reports on the atom bomb in the safe every night /laughter/. MF: Did you know what was going on? Munro; No, no, I didn't know. MF: Did you ever find out? I mean, obviously you know now, but I mean while you were working there? Munro: I know now. Well, I knew eventually that certainly it was connected with the war effort; and Hiskey came over for part of it and hinted that, you know, there really were very exciting things going on. MF: He found them exciting? Munro; Well, yes. Well, he later disappeared; we don't know quite what happened to him. He was being held, undoubtedly, in some American /laughter/ concentration camp, because at that time, you know, there were a lot of leaks to the Soviet Union and there was a lot of political stuff. That came a little later. People were getting clearances, and I know that my background had been investigated really pretty thoroughly (because people in the South let me know). And so I thought it was rather interesting that I was cleared for work on the project. MF; Did you just fall into this completely? I mean, you hadn't made a decision to change from cause work? You just couldn' t find a job? Munro 71 Munro: I hadn't made a decision, no. Well, I had been offered the job by the Garment Workers' Union, but I really wanted to stay in New York, It was really because of Dave that I was willing to take any job. He had sort of become the cause, I suppose, because we were having a sort of romance at that time. So I took the job at Columbia and stayed there. MF: Did you keep up your political activities during that time? Munro; Oh yes. As a matter of fact, Dave was a Republican, and I turned him into a Socialist. MF: /laughter/ You had your own political activity going on. Was there a conflict with the people you were working with about politics? Munro: No, not at all. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed the experience very much. Yuri was really a fabulous and fascinating man to work near. He used to have tea with the staff once a week, for example, in his office or sometimes over at Teachers' College. Also, a man named Robert Moore, who became director of the personnel office to which I was transferred from Yuri's office and really helped set up (I was an assistant to Moore),was one of the finest employers I've ever known&#8212;really a marvelous person to work for. I think he had been borrowed from the appointments office or something at Columbia. I was there. And Dave and I were, as I said. ... I'm not going to get into the personal aspects of that, because that'd be a completely different book /laughter/&#8212;much of it not publishable. But Dave left New York. We figured out the time; I think he left in ... oh gosh, would that have been '4l? I think we've got our dates mixed up here, because I think I came out to California in '42, but that would have made all this other stuff a little earlier. It was '42 or '44; I don't know. Munro 72 No, it wasn't quite that early, I think; I think it was later. Well let's see, we've got this down. Here it is, on this paper. This was dated '44, so I am right, yes. I didn't come out until '44, so he must have come in '45. MF: I think you came earlier, because you wrote to Mitch earlier. Munro: Oh good, I didn't know that. MF: In December, '45 you wrote that you had just started working at Munro: Oh then that's when I came, the end of '45. OK, December, '45. MF: In November before that you' d written to him that you'd resigned your job in the air base. Munro: Oh, OK. So I came in in November '45. I worked in the air base only a short time. So it was '45, then, that I came: probably September or so of '45. MF* Why had Dave decided to go to California? Munro* Well, he wanted to break into radio writing, script writing. MF* And was he able to do that? Munro: Well, he wrote a few scripts, and we lived in a garage near the corner of Hollywood and Vine when I first arrived. He didn't have much of a job or any job. He wrote a few scripts, and I didn't have a job. And so I went to visit my aunt who lived in Orange, and got this job (because I had to have a job) at Santa Ana Army Air Base, in the psychological research department. But of course I wanted to get back into L.A. And Dave was doing weird things too: like he got a farm worker's job out here near Santa Norfre, and a job in a tornate seed plant or something when things weren't working out with the writing. So then I did get Munro 75 the ILGWU job as educational director, as we said here, in '44. And I left in '45, so I must have worked, oh, close to two years for the union. MF: To back up just for a minute, you said that when you first met Dave in New York he had been a Republican? Munro: Yes. MF: How had you met him? How had you gotten together with him? Munro: Well, I got together with him first through Sidney Hertzberg, who was at that time editor of Uncensored. Have you heard of that publication? That was an anti-war publication, and was . . . uncensored. People who were involved in Uncensored met regularly or something. And I was having lunch, apparently, with Sidney Hertzberg and some others and met Dave. And there was a meeting of the STFU, some convention (I'd been away for a long time), but I was feeling touched that I had been asked to go to. I was then with the Workers' Defense League. And somebody suggested that Dave Munro was driving to Washington, or went often to pick up information or something, and why didn't I go and get a ride as far as Washington with him. So I did. The first time I had to go to Washington, I think, I got a ride that far with him. I went first to Washington, and then I went on back and went home to Memphis. So that's how I met him, actually: I was hitching a ride. BEGIN SIDE I TAPE III MF: . . . hard decision for you to leave New York and come out to California? Munro: No, I was in love /laughter/. I told you though, before^eept*. decided to do this I had accepted a job as the executive secretary of the India League. And I think I've always a little bit regretted that, Munro ?4 because it certainly would have been a different kind of experience and I would have met another group of people, and probably gone to India. MF: So when you took the job with ILG out here, were you working under Louis Levy? Munro: Yes. MF; What kind of work did you do as educational director? Munro: Well, I edited this newspaper; that was one of the things that I did. MF: Was this completely local? This was the Los Angeles Garment-ator? /laughter/ Munro: Yes, this was /laughter/ the Los Angeles Garmentator. My responsibility included the southwest region, but I don't remember doing very much about the region except meeting, perhaps, with other groups, I did this; I did publicity. And I organized classes of workers, adult education classes, and got people to teach classes (volunteers, and got people from various organizations and health groups), and had interest group classes as well as classes in parliamentary procedure and in union history and things of that kind. MF: How would you compare the experience working in L.A. and in Knoxville with ILG? Munro: L.A., I suppose, there again ... it was a more intimate relationship with workers in L.A. than it had been in Knoxville. Nobody' s ever asked me that question before, so I've never examined that before or thought about it before. In one of the experiences in L.A., Louis Levy was an old-fashioned union leader who was philosophically a . . . radical, and I felt I had a good deal to learn from him, to gain from him. I had Munro 75 some respect for him. He wasn't simply&#8212;as I must admit, I thought that John Martin was simply an organizer, simply a hustler. And I felt that about the southern group of organizers, really. That was not true of Louis Levy. He was philosophically what he was, and he had been (I don't know where he came from in Europe) a worker, probably a tailor or a garment worker himself. He was the real thing. And then my closest and best friend (whom I must get in touch with, because she' s in very bad physical shape now) was a Mexican&#8212;she wasn't a Mexican, I'm sorry; a Yugoslavian married to a Mexican&#8212;business agent named Anita Castro. I became very close to Anita Castro, who was then and continued to be for all the years she worked for the union (and she continued until she retired not too long ago) to be very, very close to workers in the shops. So it was a much richer experience. MF: Did you do any specific work with women workers? Were most of the workers you were working with women? Munro: Most of them were women, yes, almost entirely. MF: Did you plan any special programs directed at their interests, like setting up nursery schools or maternityleave or anything like that? Munro; No, I can't recall doing that. There wasn't any conscious women's programs, as there would be today, I think. MF: Were many of the women you were working with very involved in the union? Munro: Oh yes; they were, in fact, entirely so. I think at that time certainly two business agents and many of the organizers were women. And Anita was really the beat they had. MF: Was the war-time hiring'going on? Were r:. more women coming into Munro 76 jobs? Or were these women who were always in these jobs? Munro; I'm not really sure of that; I don't know. MF: Numbers weren't increasing around the       or anything? Munro; They may have been, and they may have not been. I was not a student; I didn't know, or I can't recall it. MF: Did you have much in common with the women you worked with? Was your lifestyle, in a way, very different from theirs? Munro: No, not really. Oh, I suppose it always is different to some extent, but it was close enough. One of the things the ILG did a lot of&#8212; I probably would not enjoy it at all now but I didn't mind it then (after all, I was a lot younger then)&#8212;we had to do a lot of social things. So we had, as well as having big meetings that people all came to, the Mexican community and people liked to do things that were fun, as I did. And I liked dancing, so we used to do things. We'd have rumba lines and congo lines and all this kind of thing, and we would have parties. I remember some of them we just used to sort of do in the afternoon sometimes. There was a women's group* there was a sort of women's auxilliary of some kind&#8212; although I don't know why it should be an auxilliary, because they were almost all women. But we certainly did have something&#8212;or maybe it was a women's social group, and we had social affairs with fun. I've got pictures of some of us dancing down in the basement of the union hall. Well, Anita used to sew on all my buttons and let my hems down /laughter/, because I never could sew very much or very well. Also, in addition to the workers themselves there was&#8212;as there have have been in almost all these areas&#8212;a young intellectual Socialist group who were involved. And Louis Levy' s son Abe Levy, who is now a lawyer in Munro 77 California, and. ... Oh what was his name? I've forgotten it; he just recently died. He was a very well-known labor leader in California. We used to meet regularly at lunch, so I had associations. There was also a Socialist local that I was active in in Los Angeles at the time. There were, you know, other activities. So although I never have been, it's quite true, really part of the groups I was working with (I've never been of them) I haven't felt so far removed that I wasn't able to share some basic human things.
