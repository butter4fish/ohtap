 Grace Hemphill Rogers: Well I can't remember the years. Constance Meyers: The years I can get from the newspapers. I want your recollections. Did you say that your sister had something to do with looking over the plants in the colleges up North? Rogers: She was appointed by the general assembly on a committee with Miss Mary Yergen and D.B. Johnson to go up North and inspect and look over the collegesthe buildings and so forthto get a pattern for Winthrop College. And later Miss Yergen was on a canoeing trip, and it capsized and she drowned. CM: Goodness1. Now this was Hannah Hemphill Coleman, was it not? Rogers: Yes. CM: How is it that she was chosen for this committee? Do you have any idea? Rogers: I wouldn't know the details of that, but I do know that she was. CM: I thought I would concentrate first on your father, and then talk about your sister's activities; your father, Robert Reld Hemphill, whose papers are at Duke University. When did you first become conscious of your father's interest in equal rights for women? Rogers: I was quite young. And all I know is that he was very active in the movement, and had great correspondence with the national people. And he had Carrie quite a bit of correspondence with Mrs. /  Chapman Catt and others. I do remember that on one occasion Pauline Yates came to our house, was a guest in our home, and made a talk in the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. And some of the church members thought that was outrageous. CM: I was going to ask, did she draw a large audience? * Dr. David Bancroft Johnson, first president of Winthrop College, Rock Hill, South Carolina. 2 Rogers: I don't remember that. CM: Were you there? Did you go to the meeting? Rogers: I don't remember that either. But I do remember that she stayed at our house, and we kids, you know, had to hide out while we had company. CM: You don't then really remember what she said, the kind of thing that she talked about? Rogers: No, I don't remember that. But I do know that my father was very active in the movement, and he was the first person in the town of Abbeville to employ women in his place of business: that is, in the printing office. We girls, all my sisters as they came along, learned how to be printers and set type and fold papers. CM: This was for the Abbeville Medium? Rogers:  Abbeville Medium, which he established, CM: And edited? Rogers: And edited. He owned it and edited it. He established it, and the first issue came out in September, I believe (or maybe November) of 1871. And as each one of the girls grew up in years, why they had parts in it. CM: Who were your sisters, Mrs. Rogers? Rogers: My older sister was Annie Annette, and she married Dr. G. A. Neuffer. They had one child; she died when she was twenty-seven and a half years old. Then the second sister was Hannah St. Clair Lynn Hemphill. She married a Coleman. Then the third sister was Mary Isabella Hemphill, and she married a lawyer, W.P. Green Sr. CM: Did she stay in Abbeville? Rogers: She lived in Abbeville.  She worked for fourteen years as assistant editor of the Abbeville Medium. And then the fourth sister was Rachael 5 Imogene, and she married Frederick Mitchell, who was an architect. He drew up the plans and superintended the work of the City Hall and the Court House and Round House out at the Seaboard shops, and other big buildings over the state. He was from West Virginia. CM: I see. Were there any brothers? Rogers: Then I had the fifth sister was Gertrude Eugenia Hemphill. And she was the poor kin of the family next to me. CM: Why do you say that? Rogers: /laughter/ We'll, she was a pitiful creature; she never was happy unless she was miserable. She always had something wrong with her, sick or something. That was a quirk she had. Then we had two boys, William Lynn Hemphill. He graduated from the Citadel as a civil engineer and surveyor, and worked with mining companies. And worked mostly for Uncle Sam all over the United States and the Philippine Islands. CM: Did he marry? Rogers: He married after he came back from World War I. He was a captain; went out with an Oregon bunch, because he was out there surveying. Then I had the next brother, Robert Grier. And he graduated from the College of Charleston, but he developed lung trouble and had to go out West in the high, dry altitude. He worked with the Federal Government Irrigation Program, and finally got to be assistant of the Rio Grande project in Texas. That's when they started raising the pink grapefruit. Then I came in; and they got so tired of having girls, and here I was. /laughter/ My mother always called me her ugly duckling. And that was pitiful, because I always wanted to be beautiful. CM: Did you? That was the standard set for women, you know: beauty, not intellect. Rogers: /laughter/ Then my brother (the baby), James Calvin Hemphill 4 was named for my uncle. And he went to the School of Architecture in Boston; that' s where he learned his trade. And he built a lot of fine buildings. He drew the plans for Celts big hospital over in Greenville. That was a four specialized million dollar project. He built schools; but he   /    in residences, small residences. He's dead; they're all dead now but me, I'm now the last leaf on the tree. CM: You're one of the last, too, to talk about the suffrage movement at all, and this is why I'm traveling all over the state to catch the last ones who can tell about it. What do you think triggered your father' s interest? Or do you not remember his having said anything about what triggered his interest in rights for women? Rogers: I wouldn't know that. All I know is that he admired women. He thought they ought to be able to have the same suffrage that a man had. And also he advocated equal pay for whatever they did. CM: Then he was interested in not only political equality for women, but economic equality. Rogers: Right. CM: He was interested in the entire question. Rogers: Well, I don't know too many details, but I do know that from memory. CM: I'd like to know a little bit more about when Miss Yates came here. You said that the women at the Presbyterian church, or the people at the Presbyterian church were pretty aghast at this. Rogers: That's Associate Reformed Presbyterian church, the ,lsam singers.** You know, the Presbyterian church came from the old Scotch covenanters. They came over here and they sang the hymns later. But in the beginning they sang the sams of David; psalms, I believe the most stylish people call them. Of * /Psalm singers^/ 5 course they withdrew; they had a split in the church way back, and they withdrew. And I understand, from what I have heard, that it all revolved around infant damnation: whether they were damned before they were born or afterwards. CM: Are you a member of this church? Rogers: Oh yes, we all are members. My grandfathers a generation back were preachers in that church. And my father, he didn't be a preacher; he decided he would be a lawyer. He graduated from ErskineCollege in 1859 as an honor graduate. And he went through the war, served the four years of the War Between the States. Then after he came home he went to Clavin, Texas and practiced there for about a year, and then decided to come back to South Carolina. He came back to Abbeville.  And then he married my mother, who had Due West graduated from the Women's College at /    in '6$. They married in 1870. They lived in an apartment on Magazine Street until November of that year, and then they bought this old two-story house on the site of where General Andrew Pickens had his fort. So that* s why that suburb is called Fort Pickens. They lived there and they had nine children: five girls, two boys, and me and the baby boy. CM: I wonder what your mother thought about rights for women. Did you ever hear her express herself on the subject? Rogers: Well, she was agreeable; she was with him.  In other words, I admired my mother quite a bit, because she was the power behind. You know, she liked to push you forward. And whatever you did, why, she would be there to help you. Papa was very fond of her, and whatever she said, why, he took her advice. It was all right for him to entertain the school teachers and other intellectual women at supper. And when they'd come, why he'd drag out his trunk of souvenirs and his letters. Oh, they would have a grand time 6 reading them. CM: Do you think perhaps your mother inspired him to his position on rights for women? Rogers: I wouldn't know whether she inspired him to begin with, but she was a continuous inspiration to him. CM: I see. Did she also inspire her daughters to achievement? Rogers: Yes. CM: In what way? Do you remember? Rogers: Well, she just would encourage them. Well, she was a small-built woman, and very witty. When she and my father married she was so small until she wore a No. 1 misses shoe. But after she lived and had all that crowd of children, why she put on weight and got to be kind of stout, in a way. But she was smart. She was an honor graduate too. And I said, the children ought to be smart with the smart parents. But some of them were a little smarter than others. CM: I know that your father was extremely interested in politics, because he was actively involved. Was your mother interested in politics, or did she not have time with that large family? Rogers: She didn't have time. My father was in the '76 movement, you know, when they took the state over from the carpetbag crowd. He was on Wade Hampton's staff. He was a brigadier general on Wade Hampton's staff. He was in the Wallace house. You know what the Wallace house is. When there were the two factions, Chamberlain was the carpetbag ruler. And the ordinary voters, they wanted Hampton, so they just hauled off and overthrew the rule and took possession. CM: I wonder what his fellow political colleagues thought of his position 7 on rights for women? Have you heard? Did you ever hear this discussed? Rogers: Well, I don't know. I really wouldn't know. That's been a long time ago. I know when my father came along, the older he got he liked to read. He liked to stir around, and I always had to help him, you know. So the last two years of his life, why, I helped in the office. Particularly the last year, I would take dictation when he would dictate his editorials. CM: How did you learn how to do that? Rogers: Oh, just longhand. And he would be dictating and I would be writing for him. And then he would nod /laughter/. CM: Approval? asleep. Rogers: No, just nodding/ And then I had a book, and I'd read. After a little bit he'd wake up and say: "What was the last word?" And I would tell him the last word, and then he' d go right on /laughter/. It was no interruption at all; he just took a little nap. But that was kind of bad. He had this heart condition, and so that was the end of him. /laughter/ But I would read while he was taking his little nap. CM: Now your mother was terribly busy, I suppose, raising those children. I was going to ask what she did, but that' s an unnecessary question. I wonder what her reaction was to your father' s suffrage activities? Rogers: Well, she was agreeable to it. I never heard anything that wasn't agreeable. Anything he did was all right; she was very much in love with him. And so whatever he did was just it. CM: What organizations did your mother belong to? Rogers: Why, when she was able to get out and stir around she belonged to the church societies and things like that, and the Cemetary societies.  She didn't have much time to go into any book clubs or things like that. 8 CM: But yet she was an educated woman. Rogers: Oh yes, she was educated. She had a lot of people who would come and visit with her, and talk and enjoy her. CM: Now what was her name again? Rogers: Eugenia. My mother was a twin. There was Eugenia and Cornelia. When they were born over in Woodruff county their mother died. She was born in 1847 on the Jlst day of October, and her mother died. And the doctor and his wife took the children. Cornelia, when she was about six months old,died of the whooping cough. So they gave my mother both names, Eugenia Cornelia. And she really had it made, because the doctor and his folks were well-fixed financially. But her own father with the other two children made a trip to pioneer to Mississippi bottomlands. And she did not know that she was an adopted child until about a month before she married. The story about that is: after a good long time, why, there came a little notice in the Atlanta Constitution wanting to know her whereabouts. And a girl that had been a roommate with my mother at school at the college wrote to these people and told them. Then they came into communication; and that was her niece, Maude Eugenia Taylor. My mother's born name was Taylor, but her adopted people were named Brewton. CM: From the Charleston Brewtons? Rogers: I don't know. They were in Spartanburg. He was a medical doctor, Dr. Samuel Brewton. CM: For what was your mother trained at the Women's College at Due West? Rogers; She just had a liberal arts schooling; that's all I know. But she had it easy all her life until she married. And after she married /laughter/ she didn't have anything but children. But she was always proud of her 9 children. CM: I wonder what the other members of your family thought about your father' s work for suffrage? Rogers: Well, they were all agreeable. You see, when each one of the girls came along and went to work in the printing office, then the other newspaper, The                                                they begun to hire girls in. And then the stores hired them in the millinery department to trim hats and things like that. CM: Do you think this was in the decade of the 1880's, the 1890's, around there? Rogers: Oh, it had to be in the late seventies or early eighties when it first started. Because, you see, he had established the paper in 1871. Well, my sister Annie was born in '71. So when she got up to teen age, which would have thrown her into the eighties, she helped him. And then Mrs. Coleman never did help much in the printing office; she was too busy stirring around /laughter/. CM: Yes. I wonder how your father combined his political life with the editorial responsibilities. Rogers: Oh, he was a good writer, a good editorial writer. His little weekly paper was really most outstanding, and he was well received and well liked by everybody. CM: I wonder if he wrote some editorials on the suffrage question? Rogers: I can't remember, but he did write a lot of editorials; and they would be in the files of the old paper. CM: Did your mother ever work, aside from her household responsibilities? Rogers: No. 10 CM; I notice that your father had this interest in women' s political equality and economic equality. Was he ever interested, did he ever concern himself with conditions for mill women? Rogers: You mean in the textile plants? CM: Yes; working conditions, child labor problems, things like that. Rogers: I don't remember that. You know, they had the mill established Abbeville in I896. The merchants around town got up the money and built the /   Cotton Mill. And they brought these sharecroppers from out in the country who were poor, pitiful, ignorant people; and they worked down there. They worked from way before daylight to way after dark. You rarely ever saw them except on Saturday when they would go to the stores. And all of them would buy kerosene in those little cans /laughter/, I remember that. And on the spout of the can they' d have an Irish potato stuck; I never did know why it was stuck up there. That was to keep it from sloshing out. CM: I think that's very interesting about the establishment of the Abbeville Mill. Rogers: Well now, the Abbeville Mill and the Seaboard airline came through here about the same time. Robert McGowan Hill was the intendent (that's what they called the mayor thenyou see, it was a village), and those two things were outstanding during his time in office. That was in I896-7. (That's one thing I'm going to run up, and it's going to be a hard job, because I already found out it was hard to begin with.) He is the one that got the fire bell, the bell to ring when we had a fire.  It's up there on the Monument Park in the center of the square on a brick foundation nowmuch to my displeasure. /laughter/ And it was a big bell and rang whenever there'd be a fire. They'd tap that and everybody would fly with their buckets, and bucket brigade and everything like that. And they call that "Big Bob." He was a cotton buyer 11 and run a general store. CM: Here in Abbeville? Rogers: Yes, there on the corner. CM: You were born and bred in Abbeville? Rogers: Oh yes. CM: When were you born? Rogers: Oh, now that don't go for publication. I was born way back yonder'. CM: Well, it looks like you'd be very proud. Rogers: No. You know, if you're out in public life, you'd better keep your age to yourself. CM: Is that right? Rogers: I am eighty, over; so that's it. I was born on the thirteenth of January. It was so close to Friday /laughter/ (my mother was superstitious), so she had me to understand that I was born on the twelfth of January. But in the Bible they had it in her handwriting that I was born on the thirteenth. CM:  I would say it was very good luck, not bad luck. Rogers: Well, I figure that anything that happens to me that happens on a Friday and on the thirteenth is good luck for me. But the Lord Saturday. CM: It seems to make for longevity. Rogers: I don't know. My mother had two brothers; one lived to be ninety-seven and one lived to be ninety-six. She lived to be eighty-seven and a few months. And Mrs. Coleman, she lived four or five weeks of being ninety-seven. So I may have that in my system, to live forever. CM: I wonder if your father ever went to national women's rights conventions? 12 Rogers: Oh, he was all the time going somewhere. CM: Did he go to women's rights conventions? Rogers: Yes. CM: He actually did go. Rogers: Oh yes. He would make speeches. CM: Did he do this in Columbia? I'm not sure that the South Carolina organization was put together yet by I9O8; and this is when he died, I know, did he not? Rogers: Yes, he died in December I9O8. CM: So there may not have been any conventions in South Carolina, but there certainly were national ones, and I wondered if he went. Rogers: Oh he would go off and make speeches. CM: He went off and addressed the national meetings. That's very interesting. Rogers: I don't remember; I couldn't tell you that. CM: Did you ever go hear your father speak here in town? Rogers: Oh no, not that. I went to political meetings when he was running for either the house or the senate. He was in politics, elected to the house so many times and to the senate so many times. And the only time that he ever was defeated at the polls was in I896, when Greenwood County wanted to be Abbeville                                                             McCormick cut off from /     County. You see, Greenwood and   /    and Abbeville was all one. CM: What was the name of that county? Rogers:  Abbeville County. Some of them referred to it as Abbeville District. CM: This was the county seat? 15 Rogers: This was the county seat. And he opposed Greenwood being cut off. That bunch over there in Greenwood came over here to Landville (a little place up in the country) and got I. H. McCauley to run on the platform of cutting off Greenwood. And they beat the pants off of him /laughter/. So then he got to be clerk of the senate, which paid double the amount of the senators' pay. He really financially benefited by the defeat. And from January of 1897 until he died he was still the clerk of the senate. CM: Did you spend much time in Columbia with him? Rogers: Oh no, I didn't spend time. I went down there on one occasion. I don't know if, looking back, I had known a lot of things that I know now I would have been more attractive, and could have drawn people to me. CM: Would you have thought of political office yourself? Rogers: No, not then. But later I did.  I am the only woman, the first woman that was ever elected to the city council of Abbeville /Taaghter/. CM: When was that, Mrs. Rogers? Rogers: That was in 1954. I served one term at it. I was too nosey, and they never would let me get back in there. So, that's one reason I don't say how old I am. But anyway, each year after that I ran. Every time there was something coming up I ran, just for the heck of it, CM: I can see, then, that your father's political interest and involvement definitely influenced your own interests and involvements. Rogers: Oh, we all were interested^politically-speaking, in anything. We worked for candidates, and tried to get people that's got nitwit sense to be a candidate. CM: It influenced your own life, and it influenced your brothers' and sisters' lives too, do you think? 14 Rogers: Oh my sister, the fifth sister, she said: "Don't do it. Don't do it. They'll just go back and bring out everything in the world." (It cost fifty dollars to make the fee, you know.) And I had adopted a child. CM: Had you? Rogers: Yes. He was a doorstep baby, a foundling. And I adopted him. And I tried every way in the world to find out, and the      crowd, the supervisor and all tried to find out who he was. But we never could find out. So I said: "Well, I'm going to run for this office now. It'll cost me fifty dollars." My sister said: "Don't do it. Don't do it. They'll just bring out everything from past generations." And I said: "Well, if I run for office and they tell me who's the father of my child, that will be worth fifty dollars." /laughter/ But I never found out anything. That's when my husband left me. /laughter/ CM: Oh. Where did he go? Rogers: /laughter/ He went to the wild woods, I reckon. No, he left because I had told him if he didn't quit tomcatting I was going to find one of the outside children and bring it home. And when I didwhy, I always thought maybe he had been around about. But he'd hauled off and left; that was it. CM: But you've managed to survive quite well and quite long. Rogers: Yes, I've survived. CM: What about your sister now, Hannah Hemphill Coleman, Mrs. W.C. Coleman? Rogers: M.T.: Martin Teague Coleman. Her name was Hannah St. Clair Lynn Hemphill, and she married Martin Teague Coleman. She had five children. The first one was named Robert Reed Hemphill for my fatherColeman, you see. And the second child was named Teague, but it lived just about nine days. Then 15 she had a daughter named Lavinia; and she married W.P. Kennedy. You might take that address and write her. Luvinia, Mrs. W.P. Kennedy, is at 2805 Augusta Road, Greenville, South Carolina 29605. I wrote to her the other day and told her that you were coming, and if she had anything she wanted me to know about her mother she could write. But she hasn't yet; I don't know, she might not do it. CM: Was your sister Hannah interested in other political topics? Rogers: She was interested in everything outside of the home. She was lazy as the mischief at home. But she worked at everything; she was going to run everybody' s business. CM: Can you tell me what other organizations she belonged to? Rogers: Oh, all the small organizations you can come up with in a small town. CM: Patriotic organizations? Rogers: Yes, anything. Mercy, she had a time of it during World War I, doing field work for the Red Cross, and helping entertain the soldiers and all like that. CM: Did she ever operate suffrage booths at the fair, the county fair? Rogers; No, not that I ever heard of. CM: Was she in the D.A.R.? Rogers: No, she didn't care anything about the D.A.R. CM: U.D.C.? Rogers: Yes, she was active in the U.D.C. She was active in the civic leagues, Civic Club.  That was quite an active organization along about the middle teens, and she was active in all that. But she could tell you how to know everything you wanted to know. BEGIN SIDE II TAPE I /long gap of unrecorded tape from about halfway through Side I to about 40 on Side 11/ Rogers: . . . why, they got this plan for collecting trash around the city. I wrote a letter to the Prison Banner and also to the Index Journal explaining that fact. (It was in last week's paper.) And a group of women under the name of the Abbeville City Club working for the beautification and betterment of the town of Abbeville prevailed on the city council to adopt a plan for collecting trash. CM: How had this matter been handled before? Rogers: Well, anybody that had trash /laughter/, he just had to take care of it himself. CM: Haul it to the dump? Rogers: Well no. People burned what they had, you see. Everybody had oook stoves and open fireplaces, and they could burn anything. And the people didn't have tin cans like they do now, and the stuff in the stores wasn't packaged like it is now. But there was quite a controversy and an argument. And that's another job I've got on my hands, is this. They've tried twice by public meetings to put a fee for collecting garbage. And I claim that we're already paying it on a general tax levy, and that if we have to pay the fee that would be double taxing. And it's wrong to double tax for the same service, you see. I don't know what they did last night at the council, but last month they voted to put a two dollar collection fee on the garbage. CM: I see that you continue to be politically active. Rogers: Yes. And they don't like me either, but I don't care. But anyway, we worked up a mass meeting. We filled the council room with so many people that they had to put it off and meet in the courthouse, where they' d have plenty of room. That's when the Jew;  the Russian Jew, was the mayor. He wanted to put a dollar fee on. Then later they brought it up 17 again; they wanted to put a dollar and a half fee on. Well, they didn't do that because we had another mass meeting. And so his son brought it up, and they got it passed for two dollars. There' s a lot of colored people, and white people both at the council meeting. CM: And you're opposing it? Rogers: Oh, certainly I'm opposing it. They ought to have either one or the other. But to take two dollars every month out of a lot of people's little income, like people on welfare and widows on pensions, and people with families. . . . CM: That's very thoughtful of you. Rogers: ... It's wrong. You see, two dollars would buy very near enough bread for a small family. CM:  I see that you too have considerable social consciousness. Rogers: What do you mean by that? CM: You're interested not only in political concerns and seeking power through politics yourself and through your family, but you're interested in social questions: you know, the improvement of the community and the betterment of the people that live in the community, the best interests. Rogers: Oh yes. Well, we have in Abbeville a ratio of three (that's 1:2); about a third of the people that vote in Abbeville are black. And there has always been that element, bringing it back from a long time ago, that the black people are what they are, and they should not have any place aboveyou know, higher up. And I contend that since they have passed the civil rights law, the thing to do is to teach the black people how to vote, and why they should vote.  So I have quite a few friends that I put out the word to that that' s what we're going to do. 18 CM: So how do you go about instructing blacks in voting procedures and political matters?  Rogers: I just tell them that if they want to vote and there's three names on the list, that the one name they want leave it clear, and the one they don't want, just take that pencil and black it out. CM: But you don't have any specific programs for instruction, like citizenship schools or anything? Rogers: Oh no, they have that of their own. All you have to do is to teach the leaders, and the leaders do the rest. CM: Tell me something. Your sister Hannah never worked, did she? Rogers: No. CM: What was her husband's reaction to her suffrage activities? Rogers: Well, he just let her do like she pleased, because she had a mind that she was going to do that anyhow. CM: Did he ever express himself on the matter? Rogers: Not that I remember. CM: Did she ever describe any incident to you that she said set her on fire for the cause of women's suffrage? Rogers: Not that I know of. She didn't consider me very bright. CM: Oh, she didn't? Rogers: No. /laughter/ Salley CM: How did she find out about Mrs. Eulalie  /  and the Equal Suffrage League? Rogers: I wouldn't know that. She was a great person to write and write and contact everybody.  (Of course I wish I could do the same thing, but I don't.) 19 CM: Did she ever hold meetings here in Abbeville for suffrage? Did she ever organize meetings here in Abbeville? Rogers: No, not that I remember. Except through the local organizations, she might have done a lot of talking then. CM: She may have talked at local club meetings that she belonged to? Rogers: Yes. CM: She was county chairwoman. Rogers: She belonged to the church. And they used to tell a story that they were having a meeting of the Methodist church. (Now she left our church and went with her husband to the Methodist church.) They were asking witnesses to express themselves, and so forth and so on. And my brother-in-law, Martin Teague Coleman got up and said that he was so and so and so and so; but he wanted everybody to know that he was the head of his house. And she immediately got up and said that all he had said was correct, but that she wanted the people to know that she was the neck that turned the head of the house. /laughter/ CM: Bravo. Rogers: I don't know whether that happened or not, but it was a good story. CM: Yes, it is a good story. I wonder if she held office in the other organizations that she belonged to, as she did in the suffrage movement? Rogers: Oh she did. She was active in everything that would broaden out in the public interest. CM: What did her sisters and brothers think of all of her activities, for suffrage and other activities? Rogers: Well, I would hate to tell you /laughter/. CM: Well now, but this is important, because it has to do with community 20 attitudes. Rogers: /Laughter/ Well, they just let her do as she wanted, because that was the only reason. She was the one in the family that had everything that she wanted. Everything. Anything she wanted, she had. CM: How did she manage that? Rogers: Well, I wouldn't know, /laughter/ But she was just one that we all had to look up to. CM: And she had five children and a husband, and still was active. Rogers; And she would tell my mother what ought to be done, and so forth and so on. CM: She had managerial ability. Rogers: I guess so.  It was more than that. CM: But did her brothers and sisters disapprove of her activities? Rogers: Oh no, they just let her have her way. CM: What about the community? How did the community respond to the idea of rights for women in the nineteen teens? Rogers: Well I tell you. A lot of the people in the community are still set in their ways] they think that a woman should stay at home and have the babies and do all the work. CM: But what if the babies are grown? Rogers: Don't make any difference. She should take care of the grandchildren. That she's got no rights whatsoever: that was the stumbling block, that women have no right in public affairs. They should stay at home and tend to their houses, and go to church on a Sunday; and that' s about the extent of what they should do. CM; Then the community must have been a little bit shocked by your sister's 21 activities. Rogers: No, they wasn't shocked. They just was ... I don't know what word I want to use, but they were indifferent in a way, I would say. But she had pretty good support and backing. CM: In the community? Rogers: Yes. A lot of the women would look up to her and admired her. We all did; she was smart. CM: The business community looked on her with condescending toleration? Rogers: No, in a way it was admiration.  It was gust the mass of people that don't care for women doing anything but just staying home and having the children. CM; But the business community did admire her? Rogers: Yes, that's right. CM: That's interesting. Did she go to Columbia? Well, she must have gon to the conventions? Rogers: Oh, she traveled all the time. She was going somewhere all the time in the interest of something. CM: But she went to the suffrage meetings in Columbia, and I guess she must have met Mrs. C&amp;tt. Rogers: I don't know whether she ever met Mrs. Katt or not. She was a Carrie Mrs.  /  Chapman (C-h-a-p-m-a-n) Catt. CM: Yes. And if she met Dr. Shaw?* Rogers: She was more interested later, I would say, in the Red Cross and the entertainment, care and interest of the boys in World War I. CM: Well, was there an Army camp nearby? Rogers: In Columbia. You see, that was Fort Jackson, Camp Jackson. And * Anna Howard Shaw then over here, Fort Gordon. CM: Did she live in Columbia at any time? Rogers: No, she lived right here in Abbeville. CM: But how did she, then, do this war work? Rogers: She traveled. She was a field representative of Red Cross. CM: Who took care of all those children? Rogers: Well, they took care of theirselves. CM: And they probably thrived. Rogers: Yes, they're all right. She had a nice house, nice furniture. CM: What did her husband do? Rogers: He was a shoe salesman with a big concern out of St. Louis, and he made pretty good money. He traveled all over this big territory. CM: Did you ever hear your sister say that she went to the national meetings? Rogers: No, I didn't remember that. I don't remember that. CM: She went to the national conventions in St. Louis, Nashville? Rogers: No, she didn't go out there. CM: Didn't she? Did she go to Nashville, Tennessee at the time that Tennessee ratified the nineteenth amendment? Rogers: No, I don't think so. Well now, under Woodrow Wilson as a war measure is when they got it through Congress. You know, as a war measure for women to have the right to vote. CM: Was there any celebration in Abbeville. Rogers: I don't remember that. There were a lot of people just thinking as I said, /   women ought to just stay at home. They ought not to do anything. The man is the superior animal. * /Near Augusta, Georgia/ 25 CM: In Abbeville were there any parades for suffrage? There were in one Aiken, for example. There was/in Greenville. Rogers: No, I don't remember any parades. CM: But there was this meeting at the church. Rogers: I know a good many would wear stickers or pins. CM: What kind? Could you describe the pins? Rogers: No I couldn't. Those are little things I don't remember too well. CM: Did you see the little thimbles that said  "Votes for women" on them? Rogers: I guess it was there. I don't remember. CM: Did you ever take part in these activities? Rogers: No, I was too young then. CM: About your father's background: now this really has a great deal to do with why he was politically motivated, I suppose, and why then he motivated his children to an awareness of political matters. What kind of home was your father raised in? Rogers: His father, William Ramsey Hemphill, was a preacher. CM: Reformed Presbyterian? Rogers: Of Associate Reformed Presbyterian; "psalm-singing" Presbyterians. And his mother, Hannah Smith Lynn, she looked after the ways of the household. And they said that she cooked on Saturday so she would not have to cook on Sunday. And they ate beaten biscuits /laughter/. All day Sundaythey called it the Sabbath Day they went to church and Sunday school (or Sabbath school). That was her way. They lived down here in the Cedar Springs section; that's not far from where the Caloom settlement was. Papa was born in a log cabin-type house. All those old, old people, there was plenty of timber around, and them they built their houses of logs. Some of them weatherboarded/on the outside and sealed them on the inside. They named it Lynndow. And it's owned now, that tract of landhe didn't own it; it belonged to the churchit's owned more recently, I think even .yet, by Carr Wells (or something like that) in Greenwood. William Clew bought the land and was going to start a vineyard. /laughter/ He put out acres and acres of grape vines. But the life that they lived was very,very religiousthe home life. CM: Yes. Did they have slaves? Rogers: Oh no. CM: I wouldn't think so. Rogers: They didn't have any slaves; they didn't have anything. A poor preacher don't have much. CM: But he did study to prepare his sermons. He was a scholar; he must have been? Rogers: Yes, he was all right. CM: Where was he trained for the ministry? Rogers: I wouldn't know. But    he was preaching down there at the Cedar Spring and the                        communitythat's the whole church and the Cedar Spring church and the original Hopewell.(it's not there anymore; the Hopewell church has only got a stone marker on the site. And unless somebody knows where it is, you'd never know it was there.) But he was offered the presidency of ErskineCollege, but declined. He took the chair of mathematics there at Erskine, and they moved to Due West. CM: Then he was indeed a scholar. Rogers: That's where they are all buried: Grandfather and Grandmother, and William and Mary (two teenage children) are buried in the A.R.P. church cemetery there in the town of Due West.Now his brother, John Hemphill, he fought a duel, and I've never known what the duel was about. But that was in the middle eighteen hundreds. He fought a duel in the state of South Carolina, and left and went to Texas. He did not marry. CM: This must be why your father went down to Texas, to see his uncle. Rogers: Yes. And after he'd been out there a while, John Hemphill got to be chief justice of the state of Texas. CM: Well, then politics really goes way back in your family. Rogers: And then there was a brother Robert that preached over here in the Chester Hopewell community. CM: An A.R.P. minister too? Rogers: Yes, he was a minister too. CM; In addition to their ministerial responsibilities, were they active in civic affairs in their local communities? I know they're just little country communities, true. Rogers: Only as they worked through the church. But they said that Robert Hemphill over there in Hopewell. . . . (That was in a book that I wished I had. A man loaned it to me, and I read it.) And there was some issue that came up in the church, and they describe Robert Hemphill as being a large, handsome man. And that whenever this issue came up, they had this church meeting, and that he harangued and harangued and harangued 'til he won his point. I said,  "That's where I get my incessant talking." CM: Was your grandmother an active church woman? Or was she retiring? Rogers: She was a stay-at-home type. She was a small-built woman, and I've been accused of being very much like her. She was a small-built woman. and But I know she used to do a lot of sewing/piecing quilts. I have a very faint recollection of her sitting by the window. She would call me and call 26 my brother James to come and thread her needles. And we'd have to thread about a half a dozen needles and stick them in a pincushion. She would have a thread about a foot long. Tiny needles and tiny threads; and then she'd piece these little parts of the quilts together. And I never could understand why she didn't take a long thread, why she wanted to take a little short thread. CM: Sometimes they tangle more easily, and she couldn't see to untangle them if she was old. Rogers: Well, she died in 1895. CM: What role do you think your father* s education played in shaping his opinions? Do you think that he got his political information in college, in his training at college? Rogers: I don't know whether that was just a born gift that he had. He was just going to be out /laughter/ in public life doing what he could, what he thought. Now he practiced law a little when he came to Abbeville,  then he established his paper. CM: Do you think his father was more influential on him, or his mother? I suppose his father was, as a preacher. Rogers: Well, I wouldn't know that. But anyhow, he did not practice law here very long before he went into the newspaper business and politics. Politics was really what he did all his life. CM: He loved it, didn't he? Rogers: Yes, he loved it. We all love it. CM: Did you ever hear any interplay of ideas between your mother and father, at the dinner table, for example? Did they discuss politics, social questions? Rogers: Oh no. CM: Religious matters? 27 Rogers: She was trying to make the children behave and eat right /laughter/. I know my father, he sat at this end of the table and my mother sat at the other end of the table. And, in turn, one of the daughters would always sit on the side of him. He liked to read his book, he liked to read his newspaper. CM: At the table? Rogers: At the table. While Momma was making the children behave and have manners, he /laughter/ was reading the paper. And the one that sat here was watching his plate, and kept it helped for him; and watched his coffee cup and everything like that.  I know for years I was the one that fixed his eggs; he had three-minute eggs for breakfast, two. And you had to fix them and put them in a little cup for him to eat. He didn't do anything. And he liked to read. CM: What about your brothers? Did they have specific responsibilities at the home too? Rogers: /laughter/ No, they didn't have anything special. My father used to sit at the table and read, of all things. . . . CM: Did he read out loud to you? Rogers: No, he just read CM: He didn't tell you, for instance, about current issues? Rogers: No. He read Watson's Story of France, /laughter/ And certain pages would come and he would cry /laughter/ about it. You know, the inhuman treatment that the rulers got during the Hundred Year War. Watson* s Story of France.  It' s a big book; kind of like that. CM; You remember that then. Rogers: But mostly he read newspapers. CM: Because of the politically and socially conscious background, did you or your brothers and sisters, growing up politically and socially conscious, 28 ever feel at odds with the community of Abbeville? Rogers: You mean, we wanted to scrap? CM: Well, perhaps. Yes. You know, like you were sort of an outsider, or didn't quite fit. You weren't quite conformists, let's say, because you were so conscious of these things. Rogers: Well, I don't know how you'd express it, but personally I am a nonconformist.  I'm an individual. And if you and I are talking, I respect your opinion. But if you don't agree with me, then I think you're stupid. /laughter/ CM:  I don't think we disagree about much. Rogers: /laughter/ I'm just using that as an example. CM:  I know it.  I know it. Rogers: I got hold of the administrator up there the other day. I said, "There's a lot of people here I like, and we've got very fine people, for the most part, in the city of Abbeville.  Outstandingly fine people, but they kind of sit back." And I said, "I like them all. But if they don't like me, I don't think they're very bright." /laughter/ CM; And I do know that you felt like running for political office yourself; in fact, did.  Did your sister ever run for political office? Here? Rogers: Yes, she ran for the judge of probate office, and beat the pants off of her. . . . CM: What year was that? Around what? What decade? Rogers:  I wouldn't know. Oh, it's been, I reckon, forty or fifty years ago.  She ran for the judge of probate office. CM: Do you think this was right after ratification of the nineteenth amendment? 29 Rogers: Oh, it's been later than that. And a young insurance man, one of these ten cents a week policy men, of course he got the vote. Then later there were several other women that tried to be elected to office. Several have been appointed to office here, but not too many have been elected by the general public. So when I decided I wanted to run to be mayor, that was something. CM: Was that the decade of the fifties? What decade? Rogers: '54. And the man that was in our ward, Ward 5 now, usually at that time held the balance of power. And if you could win Ward 5, why you were fixed. And I lived in Ward 5. We had a fellow named A.D. Simpson who was really a nice man. He worked as one of the head men, or department supervisors, at the mill. And he was the type that couldn't be beat; you've heard of that type. CM:  I've heard. Rogers; All right. CM: Your father was one, almost. Rogers: /laughter/ Almost. But anyhow, I beat him by five votes /laughter/. And the man never got over it. He had a heart condition, and he never got over it. Well, that' s all right. And the main thing that we did while I was there those two years, we run this water line from the city up to Rocky River Dam. I opposed it going up there, because we had let the people vote to send it out here to Long Cane. And it was a dry year; Long Cane Creek almost dried up, and the mill had to have water. So we voted on it to go out here for one million six hundred thousand dollars. And I asked the engineer from Atlanta, Bob Kaufman, in the council meeting,  "If we put the dam out there, how long would it last?" And he said,  "Well, if we got the dam built. . . .* (It was a natural place, with hills on the side, and it was kind of like in a valley. It was a natural location). He said,  "If we got the dam built and the good Lord filled it with water, it would last until the population of the city of Abbeville was 90,000." And I said that was all the water we would want. /laughter/ He died Sunday about two weeks ago, from Atlanta. And the man down here, Mr. Driggers, at the Light and Water Plant. ... I've seen Mr. Kaufman from time to time, because he comes over here to consult. He died. And they phoned Mr. Driggers to notify the department here that Mr. Kaufman was dead, and asked to notify me that he was dead. Well, in a way, that gave me quite a bit of pleasure /laughter/, that I was asked to be notified. So I wrote his wife. CM: It was a tribute to your political influence, your civic-mindedness. Rogers: Well, I don't know if you'd call it that or just that he admired me to a certain extent. CM: For these reasons. Rogers: Because every once in a while he'd bring up things that happened in the council that I had done. Lordy me, that was something. They had a deal up there in the council.  I owned a home place over there, 4 Pickencythe; and it's traversed by Parker Creek. They built an abatoir   across the creek for me.  It wasn't being managed too well, and it was a stinking thing. And so there was a man from Greenville who wanted to buy it, and he would do so. So they brought it up in the council that the man wanted it; and they had about thirty-five (or more) thousand dollars invested in it. The mayor, Mr. Burchart, wanted to know what we would take for it. So some of them said, "Let them have it for sixteen thousand dollars." All the building, the land, all the inside equipment and everything, sixteen thousand dollars cash. Well, Mr. Burchart said the man wanted to pay five thousand dollars down and let the city take a mortgage on the balance. So they held out, that if we were going to let him have it at such a reduction we wanted cash. That's my grandmother's trait, close Scotch trait. /laughter/ So it went on that they were going to let the man have it for sixteen thousand dollars cash; that was in May. CM: What year? Rogers: 1954. I had been sworn in in April, and that was the first deal in May. And it went on through the summer and nothing more was heard, and nothing came up in December. I got a chance, and I said: "I'd like to have the status of the abatoir." And I said,  "If he hasn't paid anything for it, I'd like to make a move that we withdraw that offer." And Mr. Burchart (he was /laughter/ somethinghe's begun to lose weight) says,  "The man hasn't paid anything; he hasn't said a word." He'd been trying to get him to do something.  "And you're just a damn liar;" that's what he told me.  I said, "I didn't steal the money'." Well, I was so shocked I couldn't say a word. And everybody else was shocked. Three times he called me a "damn liar." CM: /laughter/ Well, when you get into politics this is what you can expect. Rogers: OK. So, the next day I found out that the man had put up five thousand dollars in a check, and it had been turned over by the mayor to the clerk to put in his safe in the office, and keep it locked and keep it quiet. And I couldn't understand that, so I begun to investigate why. And I even wrote to the man in Greenwood and asked him if there was any agreement whereby he should keep that secret.  I mailed the letter on a Wednesday; Tuesday night was the night the thing happened. And I didn't hear from him until Monday.  I got a letter in the mail Monday, and he said there was no such agreement. But in the meantime on Saturday he came over and paid the balance of it, and they 52 gave him the deed to it. There was something crooked; I don't know what it was going to be. So everything that I wanted to do after that, well, I got the defrost. And they never did let me get back in office anymore. BEGIN TAPE II SIDE I CM: Now, you were telling me about your career in the city council, and their response to your involvement in the abatoir. Rogers: Yes. Well, I finished that, didn't I? CM: I believe. Rogers: OK. So the outstanding thing we did that year was to run the water line up to Lake Sesation instead of out to Long Cane, because it's two hundred thousand dollars more. I opposed the change; and my point was that it would catch all the sewer water from the city of Anderson as it wasthat was up at the head of it. And while there was billions of gallons of water in the lake, when they purified it they would have to use such strong chemicals to purify it that it would rot your guts out. That wasn't a very nice thing to say. But they laughed at me, and run it on up there, /laughter/ Well, ever since then they've had trouble, trouble, trouble. People have had cancers, they've had this and they've had that, and they've had the other. And the year before last from they had such a thing they even had to get people/away from here to come in and test the water and check up on it, because it smelled and tasted just like you'd taken it out of the commode.  It was awful. And I never have thought that the Rocky River place was where we should get our source of drinking water. Even Mr. Kaufman said a better grade of water would come from Long Cane. He was a nice fellow, and from time to time I would talk to him. /Taughter/ They got a government loanyou know, these loans that you match, from HUD and the Environmental thing. 55 CM: This must have been recently then. Rogers: Yes. Year before last. Because I keep in touch. CM: And you're still sticking your nose in politics. Rogers: Yes, got it in there deep down, and can't hardly get it out. /laughter/ But anyhow, they were going to put sewer lines all over the city. I have always figured that there should be main lines for sewrage and water and the other facilities, where it would be accessible to all the residents. And so they spent three hundred and fifty thousand dollarsthat's the overall price, what we got from the government and the local amount raised. I talked several times with Mr. Kaufman on that deal. And the last time I talked with him I said, "Well, how much longer are you going to be here?" And he said, "Well, we're finishing up, and when we get through we'll have the whole town served, with lines on every street." I said, "How about Wilson Hill?" He said, "Wilson Hill? Where is that?" I said, "Well, God damn, it's right over there next door to where I live, my property." I said, "It's a Negro community with fourteen houses. And there' s two septic tanks. There' s no sewer lines, and the people use buckets and throw the contents out in the yard." And I said, "You haven't got that?" "No, I never heard of it." And so they had a movement; and of all the town this one little section, right almost in the heart of the town, with that condition, they claimed that it would cost too much to put sewer lines there, as it' s full of hills. So year before last (or, last year it was now), they got a notion that they wanted everybody who had dilapidated houses to tear them down. And on this property I had two little houses I had built for rental purposes; low rent. And they'd been empty and naturally they'd deteriorated. They were in bad shape, but I still paid tax on them. So they notified me from the local Health Department and from the Upper Savannah District Health Department that I must clean up those places; either fix them up or clean them up. And I went around; I talked to the man at the local health department. That was on the instructions of the city of Abbeville. And I told him; I said, "I'm not going to clean that up until Wilson Hill is cleaned up." And the man came over from Greenwood for the Upper Savannah thing. I talked to him up there in front of the courthouse. I said, "Now I want to cooperate with you folks. I'm going to do that; I'll be very happy to do it. But I'm not going to be the goat. And whenever you get the rest of it cleaned up, I'll be very happy to cooperate." Then I told him about Wilson Hill. I said, "Now when you get that clean, I'll be most happy," That's the reason I say my title is "dilapidated property owner," /laughter/ And so it's still there. They want to run the neighbors out of town, is the reason they're not giving them the proper facilities. And I tell the Niggers, if they have paid for their houses, own them under the civil rights, they are due that service. CM; Yes, they are. Rogers; They are due that service. CM: What about street lighting? Do they have that? Rogers; Oh, they have a few lights over there. They don't have the fire protection; they have to go over to the next street before they could hook up with a hydrant if a house caught on fire. It's just a pure Negro section. CM: Yes. And it's not typical of all of Abbeville. Rogers: No, no. Just this one little place. But the point is it adjoins me; the land adjoins me on the west. CM: And so you're very conscious of what's taking place. Rogers: Well, nobody wants to live by it, you see. It's been a financial 55 loss to me. I built the houses and I sold two of them. There was four in the beginning. I sold two and one of them burned, so there' s the remnants of three there now. The man still lives in the house I sold him, and he's so nosey until people don't want to live by him. CM; I thought you said there were fourteen houses up there. Rogers: That's my property, that adjoins this Negro section. There's fourteen houses, fourteen families, /laughter/ Frank Flemming bought an old was brick building, and he / going to fix it up to rent to colored people. And he got it all fixed up, and they come down there and says, "You've got to bring it up to standards. You have to put in the bath and the and all like that. You've got to bring it up to standard." And so he spent a lot of money putting it all in, and then there was no line for him to connect with. And the city wouldn't put a line for him to connect with. Forcing him to do that, and then wouldn't give him the line. And so finally they told him he had to tear it down. CM: A new construction? Rogers: It wasn't a new construction. It had been a warehouse. And when the railroad was discontinued it had been used for a living quarters for colored people. They had put partitions in it. And he said he was just so sick of the way they did, he just moved to the country. CM: I imagine though, in your childhood, you had numbers of black servants, because your mother with all those children needed help. Rogers: Oh yes. We always had a cook. Then we always had someone that could come and do the yard work. And a lot of people bought wood by the cord and had it cut in the yard so you could pick up the chips. That was one of my jobs, bringing in a basket of chips every evening to start the fire with. 56 CM: Was this your family home across the street here? Rogers: No. I bought that. Where I was born, I tore the house down.  I bought it after my mother, and all, died and the estate was to be settled up. I bought the home place in. And it was in bad shape, so I sold the actual site to the REA office, and I moved the house and used the best timber to build one of these little rental houses. But this house where I live, right across the there, is known as/old Valentine Hammon house. I have been trying to work up the history on it, and I believe that Robert Dindy built the house about I85O, somewhere back in there. And this house right here, this big house, was built in I896, but it* s on the site where Governor Noble had his house. So that's on the tour when they have a house tour; they bring them down here and show them this big house. And right over here is a two-story house that I believe is the first house ever built in Abbeville. CM: And who built it? Rogers: Andrew Pickens. Andrew Pickens married Rebecca Calhoun  in 1760. In 1767 that house was built. But then the Andrew Pickinses, they built a block house over on the land which I own now, and they called it Fort Pickens. And so if I can find the facts to back me up, that's what I'm going to claim is the first house in the city of Abbeville. CM: Are you going to see that an historic marker is erected there? Rogers: No, I'm just going to tell them it's there, /laughter/ and if they want to put the historical marker they can do it. CM: Tell me. Ms. Hughes, the librarian here, indicates that you have a specific philosophy. I'd rather like to hear you tell it. Rogers: Oh, you know, in a way I'm a non-conformist of the social customs and rules and everything like that. I'm more of an individualist. And I base 57 that on the fact that the very rich and the very poor can do as they please. It's the great middle class that has to follow custom. Now you can take your choice of which you think I am. /laughter/ If you want to streak, if you' re rich or poor you can streak'. But if you belong to the middle class it' s a sin. CM: And if you belong to the middle class and you work for a wage or a salary, you're liable to be fired if you outrage public opinion. Rogers: That's right. That's right. CM: And it doesn't matter if you're poor. Rogers: Now I started that several years ago when I was going to try to run for office. "Oh, you have to paint your face." "You have to do this." "You have to dress up." "You have to so and so, and so and so." I said, "My clothes are not the one that's going to do the talking." And that come at me every time, "Well that's why you got defeated; you didn't dress nice enough." And so I said, "Well, the very rich and the very poor can do as they please. It's the middle class that's got to follow custom." CM: What was their response? What did they say to that? Rogers: Oh, they think I'm goofy. I'll tell you how goofy they think I am. For fifteen years I wrote a little local column, sort of like country correspondence, you know: Miss so-and-so going here, and they're coming over here and eating dinner, back and forth shuttle stuff. CM: For what paper? Rogers: For the Anderson Independent. And when they sold it to that chain, of course the chain newspapers changed all the policy of having local correspondence like that. So I was a casualty; I don't write anymore. But /laughter/ they got rid of all of them, all/the ones that wrote up all the. . . . 58 CM: Was this "Grace Rogers Column"? Rogers: Yes. No, it was just Abbeville by my name. And so I wrote different things. But I' d always try to edge a little political news in and a little history news in, or a little joke every now and then. It was well-read, and we /laughter/ increased the subscription by quite a few hundred. I would love, if I could place my hands on it, to let you read a letter that Mr. Wilton Hall wrote me. CM: What did he say? Paraphrase it. Rogers: I think he admires me, in a way, and my abilitywhatever you want to call it. But the way it started was, in 1957 my children had all gone. I had nothing to do, and I thought, "Well now, if I can just write for a newspaper and they paid me a little bit, it would be all right. If they don't, it would be all right." So I started through a local boy that was at the state news desk; that's how I got started. And then they wrote me up and everything. But Mr. Hall said that he just wanted me to knownow he's a big manhow he enjoyed my reading.  It was easy, and so forth and so on; that he was going to see what he could do to prevail on the state editors for me to write two columns /laughter/. I told James; I said, "James, you know I couldn't do that." I said, "I sure would have to start a line if /laughter/ I tried to write two columns a day." But it really was an asset to the paper. And I wrote a little script here last month for John Beckwith about the slave market built, so he could have the information. He's going to try to sell it, and I'll give you a copy of that. CM: Thank you. Rogers: And I sent one to Mr. Hall, and I just put a little note in. I said, "This is for your reading pleasure," and just signed my initials. About 59 a week after that the girl, Betty Brown, called from his office and said that she was calling for Mr. Hall; that he had misplaced that article and he wanted another copy. That he thought it was well-written, and that he liked it, and could I get him another copy. Which I did, and sent it to him, I said, "What is he going to do with it?" (Of course, that's curiosity). She said she didn't know; she thought he was going to have some more copies made of it. I don't know. CM: Tell me. How did you become so literate, that you could write a newspaper column like that? Where did you go to college? Or did you? You must have. Rogers: I figured you'd soon ask me that. I never went to college in my life. CM; Didn't you? You went through high school here in Abbeville? Rogers: I graduated from the high school the year when they had ten grades. Then I thought I was smart enough to teach school. And I taught the country school out there. I got a county teacher's certificate. I taught the Monterey School for one year; it was a one-teacher school. And I said I drew my breath /laughter/ at my salary;/! didn^t teach those children anything. Then that summer Minnie Green and myself went over to Winthrop to the Teachers' Short Course. And there was about three hundred people over there; about two hundred and fifty women and about fifty men. And we knew all the men, but /laughter/ we didn't know any of the women over there. But I met a fellow that was teaching down in Williamsburg County, and he wanted me to go down there. And I said, well I' d just need go down there as anywhere else. So I went down in Williamsburg County. They had consolidated a schodl down there, and it was twenty-three miles out from Lake City. That was the closest railroad. And God knows, it 40 was the most lonesome, dreary place I ever saw in my life. Although the house where we boardedthere was two other teachers boarded therewas practically new, and there were lovely people. There were about half a dozen real rich families, and the rest of them were just poor people. But that cured me of teaching. CM: Did it? Rogers: Then I came back home and went in the office with my father. And in 1907, in September, he decided to put my name up as associate editor. And I felt I was, oh so fine /laughter/. CM: And he did do it? Rogers: Oh yes, he did. CM: How long were you associate editor? Rogers: Well, he died in 1908; and then I had full charge of the paper for two years and we sold it. And I've always been sorry that we sold it. But it would have had to come out of his estate to have made the titles clear and all.  I was very much in love then, and I wanted to get married; and that was it. CM: Where did your sister Hannah go to college? Rogers: Well, she did go down here to Leesville and took art. CM: Was there a special art school there? Rogers: I don't know whether it was a special one, but she went down there /laughter/ for one season. And she is the only one that got to go to college. CM: What about your brothers? Rogers: William graduated from the Citadel, and Bob graduated from the College of Charleston. CM: How was it that he chose the College of Charleston? 41 Rogers:  I don't know.  I guess that was because of Uncle Calvin being in Charleston. CM: Calvin who? Rogers: James Calvin Hemphill. He was the editor of the News and Courier for years. CM: What years? Do you remember? Not exactly, but say the decade. What decades? Rogers: Well, that was long in the late nineties, maybe late eighties and nineties up until in the nineteen hundreds. I know he was there when President Taft came down, and he was on the committee to escort him around. CM: Well, that was between 1908 and 1912. Rogers: Well anyhow, he was there then. It was several years after that before he left. Well, they reorganized, and he went to Washington, D.O. and was the correspondent for the Philadelphia Ledger for a while. That's Uncle Calvin nowJames Calvin Hemphill. And he was with the Richmond Times Dispatch for a while. The older he got, why, he came to Spartanburg and worked for the Spartanburg Herald, and then came to Abbeville and lived with my sister Mary. His wife died over there; they didn't have any children. CM: How did he stand on suffrage? Rogers: I wouldn't know. My father called him a crank, and he called my father a crank, so they didn't always agree. CM: What did your sister engage in as far as political activities were concerned after ratification? Did she go into the League of Women Voters? Rogers: Oh, she always had something to do with that, and any other public organization that came along. She was right there. CM: But she went right into the League of Women Voters right after rati- 42 fication? Rogers: I would say so. CM: She didn't go into business or anything on the side? She didn't help her husband in the shoe business? Rogers: No, she just saw that he gave her all the money. CM: Did she lobby for any reform laws? Was she as active, for instance, as you are now? Did she seek to get change of one kind or another in the community? Rogers: Yes. She tried to run the town, if you want me to say. CM: Can you give me some examples? What were some of the measures that she stumped for? Rogers: I don't know. She wrote a lot. She wrote for different articles, and wrote stories, and she wrote a little book. CM: What was the title of her book? Rogers: I don't know. It was something about the family, what they all did and all. I don't think she had much success in selling it, because nobody's caring anything about your family, unless it's got a little scandal in it. CM: /laughter/. But if she stuck her nose, as you say, into all the community concerns. . . . Rogers: Her main theory was "Rule or ruin." If she couldn't rule it, she wouldn't have anything to do with it.  "Rule or ruin" was her main theory. CM: She must have been a very interesting personality. Rogers: Very determined. CM: What were her special projects in town? What was one special project that you remember that she worked for? Rogers: Well, she was with the City Club, as I told you. 45 CM; Yes, and the trash. . . . Rogers: Trash, and anything else that they did. Now, while she was there as Civic Club president, I was a member, and I had charge of the health committee. And I wanted to do something real fancy, you know. Wanted to be outstanding. So I put on a Better Babies Contest; you know, that begun to be very popular along in the teens. We'd been having beauty contests; you know, giving the prettiest child a prize. And we decided we wanted to do something different; it was beginning to be very popular then to do things for the betterment physically, and so forth and so on. So we put on this Better Babies Contest. And I don't mind telling you that when I've asked people to help me they always are glad to do it; they want to be part of it. So we had ninety-six babies enrolled; ninety-six. And we invited all the big doctors in the county. . . . CM: Were they the judges? Rogers: No, they were the performers /laughter/. And they got Doctor Malone to come over here from Chester Hospital, and we got a couple of dentists from up at Greenville (I've forgotten their namesKirkpatrick, or something like that). And then the feather that was in the cap was we got Doctor William Weston of Columbia; he was the baby specialist. He came for his railroad fare, and entertainment. We paid the railroad fare and entertained him. And I think old man Kane had to stay around her house, and then she became a good patron or customer. But Dr. William Weston was the one that came here, and they examined the babies. CM: Ninety-six of them? Rogers: Ninety-six of them. And old man Joe Edmond's daughter, Martha, 44 made a score of ninety-eight. And there was a child they brought in from the county farm that made a score of thirty-seven. But it was really something nice. We liad it all up there in the new courthouse. Had the long tables; and all the visitors sat out where the court spectators sit, you know. And the babies were all here; and we had the different rooms. It really was something unusual for the town. CM: What was the maximum age for the babies? Rogers: Well they had to be, I think, not over two or three years. Anywhere from the time you could get them there 'til three years. CM: Now this was what you did in the Civic League while your sister was president. Rogers: And it was really a nice thing. CM: Did your sister involve herself in the library founding, anything like that? Rogers: I don't think she did, but Mrs. Green, my third sister. . . . Why, she didn't do quite as much stating 'round about as my sister Hannah did, but she was very active in anything that had to do with the betterment of Abbeville. And she' s the one that got the library started. CM: What was her first name? Rogers: Mary Isabella. She married W.P. Green, William Pinkney Green. CM: Where was he from? Rogers: Out here in Buckstan neighborhood, between here and Due West. Just a country boy. But he was a smart lawyer, and he has a son named Bill, Jr. that still practices law here. Bill                              the only one now except Genia Howe, the family that lives around here. Bill married a girl from Columbia. But Mrs. Mary Green, she' s the one that put up all the markers all 45 over town. CM; Did she? Rogers: Oh mercy. She was all the time doing something like that. CM: And what did your sister Eugenia do? Rogers: Gertrude Eugenia? She just complained. CM: She wasn't active? Rogers: Listen. She run an eating place: called it the Gretchen Grill. I helped her down there, Mrs. Green and myself both, /laughter/ We* d go down. And every weekend we had a round square dance; got a band to come in. That*s the only time they ever made money. She didn't know how to make money on foodstuff. She made food that was good to eat, you know. Everybody liked the food. CM: But it didn't turn a profit? Rogers: No, no profit on it. And I told her; I said, "The way you do, when the receipe calls for one egg, you put in two. You ought to split that egg, and then you' d make a profit." /laughter/ CM: You people must have been a very colorful family in the community. Rogers: Oh yes. We'd fight and quarrel. But some outsider better not come along and fight and quarrel with us, because then we' d gang together. But I don't mind telling you, I was always the least conspicuous and the poor kin of the family. CM: Until later years? Rogers: I don't know about later years. CM: In the fifties, say, when you ran for office. Rogers: Yes. Well, when the cotton mill first came here in '96, the people were sharecroppers from the farm. They were uneducated; good people, 46 but just lacked in education and refinement, and all like that. And old Abbeville was such an aristocratic town that there was a definite line drawn between the mill people and the town people. And that's still there. Anybody that lived below Walnut Street (that's just two blocks down) down on the mill hill wasn't anybody. They were just poor folks. CM: Aside from your family, what are some other old family names of Abbeville? Rogers: Well, I don't know. But anyhow, going on with this story, when the railroad came through here and the advance men came in and everything (surveyors and all), no woman of any respectability woiild have anything to do with that railroad crowd. And so later on there was a little difference, and people begun to accept the railroad people a little more. But I met this boy from North Carolina, and I married him. CM: Rogers? Rogers: Yes. And we moved onto South Main Street.  I said I sure had played hell; married a railroad man and lived on South Main Street /laughter/, where nobody was considered anything, either the railroad or the mill people. But after they changed from cotton to rayon they reorganized the mill and made it a rayon mill. And they have, oh I don't know, all worsteds and all kinds of stuff down there now, and it really is an outstanding mill. A lot of people in the town have gone there to work. And those poor people that came in here in the beginning, they're gone. CM: Well, their children have grown now, and their grandchildren are growing up. Rogers: And their education, and so forth and so on. But the main people in Abbeville are named Smiths, the Wardlaws, and the Perrins; you can read 47 all those in the history. All those. And then I'll tell you one thing: the Calhouns came in here under Patrick Calhoun, who was the father of John C. Calhoun, in 1758 and settled down on the Long Cane section, down near toward the Savannah River. And in I76O the French Huguenots came in here under Jean Louis Gibert from France. And they were running to get away from religious persecution. They were the better class, they were the intellectualsall Presbyterians. And then the different crowds filtered in. But they intermarried, and that's where our brains come from. CM: Yes. Do you have some of this blood in your veins? Are you a kin to the Giberts? Rogers: No, I wasn't a kin. But we sent men of outstanding ability out into the war; and that's where the brains came from, from the intermarrying of these two groups. Well anyway, that's that. The Giberts and the Gilibeaus and the Giberts, and Jean Louis Gibert. . . .
