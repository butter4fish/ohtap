Mary Frederickson: Dr. MacDonald,  first I wanted  to ask you where you were born and  when you were born. Lois MacDonald:  I was born in Wlnnsboro,  South Carolina, on August 28,  1897.    If I live till Sunday,  I'll be eighty years old, believe it or not.    [Laughter] M.F.; I'm sure you'll live till Sunday. [Laughter] First I wanted to ask you about your family in the South and how far back your family origins go in the South. MacDonald* On my father's side,  his grandfather came from Scotland and  settled.   ...      I don't know,  he was ambling around the way people did in those days,  and  he finally settled  in Georgia.    And my father's father,  who was Laughlin MacDonald,  grew up in Georgia.    And  he went to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.    He graduated  in 1837.    At that time the Presbyterians in the South didn't have a seminary and  higher education,  so many students went to Ohio to be educated.    My grandfather was one of those, and he took his training to be a minister there.    And then he came home,  and  before he settled down to get a pastorate he took a trip by horseback from Georgia all down through Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, did  the routine in those days when there was no communication and  no nothing.    And  some few years ago,  my older brother,  who had my father's desk,  was doing something about it and he discovered  a secret drawer in that desk.    I think he had  to take it apart to get to what was in there.    I think he hoped  there would  be an awful lot of money or bonds or something.    [Laughter]    What was in there was a diary that my grandfather had made on this trip.    He looked up people who had migrated from the Garolinas,  Georgia,  going through 2 what they now call the Sunshine Belt.    And then he came back and  was the pastor of two small churches in Fairfield  County,  South Carolina, and  he is buried up at the New Hope Cemetery.    And my father was born in Fairfield  County,  South Carolina,  and he went to Srskine College, where my older brother and  I went.    I went there for my last three years, not the freshman year.    And  in the meantime, TCrskine had  been established,  and there was a seminary,  and my father took his ministry education there and was first pastor of a church (these are ARP's, the psalm-singing Presbyterians)  called  Steel Creek in Mecklenburg, North Carolina.    And my mother was born in Mecklenburg.     I think the house was in Mecklenburg, North Carolina.    My grandfather's land lay partly in South Carolina and  partly in North Carolina,  but the residence was in North Carolina.    So while my father was doing this pastorate there,  he met my mother.    They were married,  and my mother's family.   .   .   .    And further back I don't know very much about my family in Scotland,  and  I don't know an awful lot about the family in Georgia where my grandfather came from.    The only record  that we have that's very significant, they were supposed  to have had  a lot of land. I suspect they were land-poor whites [laughter],  but I don't know. But on my mother's side,  the ancestry is more a matter of record. Her name was Margaret Harris, and my Grandfather Harris was descended from John Harris and Eleanor Reynolds, who got their start in Scotland and  wanted  to get married  and  come to this country.    Their preacher there had  gotten in trouble with the authorities.    He was in jail, so my [laughter] longtime ancestors went into the jail, and their preacher tied  the knot.    And *51eanor Reynolds and  John Harris came to this country. 3 And  they settled first in Pennsylvania, and  they were a part of that movement back around 1700,  give or take some years,  that moved down through Virginia, through the Shenandoah Valley, down into the Carolinas and  lower Virginia.    And my grandfather's father finally settled  in Mecklenburg,  South Carolina, about twelve miles southwest of Charlotte. And my mother was born there.     We have an ancestor who is very famous in North Carolina history.    His name was Hezekiah Alexander.    Hezekiah was a big gun in the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence days. And after they signed their declaration,  they thought they'd  better get it up to Philadelphia,  where the meetings were being held,  so that it would  get on the record.    Hezekiah and  an associate got on horseback, and  they galloped  up from the neighborhood of Charlotte to Philadelphia, and  they handed  this declaration in to the North Carolina delegates. And the North Carolina delegates said,  "This is not the time to have this presented  to the Constitutional Convention.    Let's wait,  and  we will pick the right time."    So Hezekiah and his friend left the document, whatever it was, there, and it has never been seen since.    Therefore, there is no historical document that shows that the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence preceded  the real Declaration.    [laughter] Well,  that's Hezekiah,  and  in suburban Charlotte  (it used  to be in the country),  where the Methodist Home is, out towards Monroe, out southwest on a main road,  there's a home there where one of my aunts was for two or three years before her death.    And  right in that complexI think the Methodists bought this housethere is a Hezekiah Alexander House that the DAR have restored  and  so on.    I 4 was there two or three times to see my aunt, but the house was not open for inspection at that time because they hadn't finished  it. But that is the sort of interesting story of my family history on my mother's side. M.F. t Did  you know your grand parents as you were growing up? MacDonald:  I did  not know my father's parents.     I knew my mother's parents very well,  because after my mother died we spent every summer in Pineville,  North Carolina,  with my mother's parents.    As soon as school was out,  we were transferred up there.    And one of my aunts the one that in this fairly large family never marriedmy grandmother, and my grandfather took care of us during the summer season.    And then when my grandfather died, my aunt and  grandmother moved  into Charlotte, and  a man rented  the old farm.    And then I used  to spend a great part of the summer up there in Charlotte with my grandmother and my two aunts, the one that died  in the Methodist Home and  another one.    So I was very familiar with and  grew up with my mother's family, but I didn't know very much.   ...    We had  a different kind of relationship to my father's family.    He had a sister who died before my day.    Then he had two brothers,  and  I knew them and knew their families.    And one of those brothers was our guardian after my father died.    He lived  in Winnsboro,  and his children grew up with us,  so we were very closely related  as cousins and visited back and forth. And one of those cousins is the father of Laughlin MacDonald,  who is now head of the Civil Liberties activities with the office in Atlanta. I'm one maverick,  and he's the other maverick [laughter] in an otherwise 5 fairly conservative family. M.F.t  When you were visiting your grandparents all those summers outside of Charlotte,  they lived on a farm? MacDonaldt They lived on a farm. M.F.: Was it a large farm? MacDonald: It was large for that.   ...    It was about 300 acres, and that was considered  an economic unit there.    And my grandfather raised  cotton,  and  he always had horses.    We had our own horses when we were there to take.    As soon as we were able to take care of a horse, we were given a horse to ride and  to take care of.    And my uncle that we lived with after my father diedthat was our permanent home from that time onhad  the same philosophy.    He said,  "Children should have their own horses as soon as they're able to ride them and  to take care of them." So while we lived out at this very famous cotton plantation right outside of Winnsboro called  the Adger Plantation,  we had donkeys and horses and  grew up with animals.    And my grandfather was not as prosperous as my uncle.    My uncle's acreage was about 2,200,  and  by degrees they had bought farmland that was adjacent to their own place. And. as farm families, the young people, didn't want them, my uncle and his father would  buy them up,  and when they finished  they had the Adger place.    It had an "s" on it as people talked about it.    But it was a tremendous tract.    I can just offhand  think of four farms that were a part of that.    Much of it was woodland, very beautiful woodland. So that is the sort of historical background.    And my father, from Steel Creek in Mecklenburg County, after he and my mother were married 6 he took on the pastorate in Winnsboro.    That's where we were born and grew up.    I think I must have been about in the fifth grade in school, and he got a call to move to Chester,  South Carolina,  which is between Charlotte and  Winnsboro about twenty-five miles north of Winnsboro. And  we were there two years when my father died,  and my mother had died  way back in 1903,  I guess. M.F.t  What did  they die of?    They died  so early. MacDonald: My father was a diabetic.    He wouldn't have died,  if he were living now, at that age.    He was in his mid-forties,  I guess. And my mother died of uremic poisoning.    She had another child  and there were complications, and  probably she wouldn't have died  under modern medicine. M.F.i So it was just you and  your older brother then. MacDonald: No, there were an older brother and  a younger brother, and they are both living.    We grew up.   .   .   .      My mother's sister was married  to John H.  Cathcart, and the Adger place was a famous Cathcart name.    They were big frogs in a little pond.    They took us in when my father died,  when we were therefore orphans.    My grandmother,  then living in Charlotte, wanted  to take us,  but nobody thought that was a good  idea.    And our guardian thought we should go and live with a distant cousin who had been the housekeeper for us from the time my mother died until my father died.    She lived  up in Mecklenburg County with a brother when she wasn't staying with us, and my uncle thought that that would be a good  thing:  just let Cousin Emma continue to take care of us.    My aunt, who finally got us, blew her top [laughter], because she said,  "That would be no life for those children.     We just 7 mustn't let that happen."    So she put in her oar,  and  her oar was always pretty good,  and  we wound up living out at Adgers with them. And they had one son,  whom I feel and felt as if he were my brother. He was about four or five years old when we came,  and we sort of grew up.    And he and  I were always very compatible.    I was compatible with all my brothers, but there was a somewhat different strain.    This brother,  I call him, was John Harris.    He had the name of the old ancestor from Scotland, although the "Harris" really was taken from my grandfather.    So the four of us grew up there.    And  then when we got to the high school age.   .   .   .    My uncle's elderly parents lived there,  so in this housefortunately,  it was a great big housethere were three generations and three or four sort of family units with the old  people and my aunt and  uncle and  then their child and  the three of us. M.F.i An extended family.    [Laughter] MacDonald t So we had quite a family, and my uncle always had a superintendent, a man, on the farm who lived in the house, who was part of the family.    And every time we sat down at the table there would be nine people.    And my older brother's always laughing about, we ran what was almost like a summer hotel,  because during the summer the cousins all came to visit, and  some old friends of the old  folks would  come up from Columbia to visit.    So all summer long there was somebody else in the house, aside from the permanent residents.    So it was an interesting kind of childhood.    We were taught very great respect for the elderly,  because these two,                          and  Marsand, 8 were my uncle's parents,  and  they welcomed  us because they were devoted to my father, and they wanted us taken care of.  So we had no feeling anywhere along the line that somebody was going to a lot of trouble for us; we were made to feel that it was their pleasure and privilege to take care of these kids. M.F.i What was your aunt like?    Did  you grow very close to her? MacDonald: Yes.    She'd been a teacher before she was married, and she had  very high standards.    And  she saw to it that we were taught manners,  and that we learned to study.    But she was a very affectionate.   .   .   . She was stern,  in a way.    If anybody didn't toe the line that had been laid down.   .   .   .    But the lines were laid down.     We knew where the limits were.    But she was not great on punishment.    But she would give you a good sermon.    She was a very unusual woman,  I think.    When we got into high school, one of the older people had died and  the other one was going to go to live with her daughter in town,  and I think my uncle was about ready to turn over some of his responsibilities,  so we moved into Winnsboro.    We'd been five miles out.    And we rode to school in a pony buggy.    I must have been about two grades in high school.    The two younger boys were coming along, and my aunt especially thought our social life needed  a little brushing up,  so my uncle bought this place in town.    We all moved down there, and from the time I was about in what we would  call the ninth grade,  we lived  in the town of Winnsboro a half a block from the ARP Church.    So we were still sort of under the wing of the church.    When we moved out, my uncle got not just a single man,but a family moved  in as managers of the farm,  and that worked out very well for a few years,  and then 9 there was a fire;  the house burned.    Nobody knows yet what actually happened, but this was a frame housethe chimneys weren't very tight but there was something wrong and the house burned.    And  this family moved back where they came from.    Then my uncle had,  really,  a series of tenant farmers who were in these various plots.    And  that went on for some years,  and  then finally the place was sold.    And  the person who bought it rebuilt on the same spot.    It isn't the same kind of house.    He built a red  brick house,  kind of plain,  and  the shrubbery and the trees were               .    There used  to be a holly tree out there that was about fifty feet tall,  right up within twenty feet of the house.    That was so badly burned  it had  to be cut.    If you go on the main highway from Winnsboro up to Charlotte,  you pass right by this place,  and  it doesn't have the look that it used  to have because it doesn't look like an old eighteenth-century farmhouse.    My aunt loved flowers,  and  she had  beautiful roses,  climbing roses all over the place, and  it really was a very attractive.   ...    It wasn't fine; it wasn't like Tara, but it was a working farm that was very well kept,  and  people who would  ride on would  think,  "Oh,  what a nice place."    Well,  it doesn't look that way now. M.F.i I wanted to ask you a little bit more about your mother and father.    Do you remember very much at all about your mother? MacDonald: I don't remember my mother in any way except little fragments.    I have no recollection of her character or the kind of person she was.    I judge she was a very able person and a very much respected and loved  person,  but I got that through secondhand  sources. M.F.: Do you know anything about the way she was reared?    As 10 the daughter of a cotton planter, was she a southern lady? MacDonald: Oh, no.    My grandfather wasn't a planter in that sense.    In the countryside there weren't public schools,  and my grandfather and his neighbors got together,  under my grandfather's sort of initiative, and they built a little schoolhouse.    And  that's where my mother and  the sisters and brothers went to school back in the old days.    The Harris line was great on education,  and all of my grandfather's children went to college.    The girls went to what turned out to be Queens College; now,  I guess,  it's a branch of the University.    It used to be called the Charlotte Female Institute,  and it had the arts,  science, music, literature, the usual curriculum of a school that had.   .   .   .    It must have been the Presbyterians who ran it.    It's funny I never thought of it before.    My two aunts and my mother all went to that school. And my mother taught for a year or two in this little neighborhood  school,  and  then when she was married she didn't teach anymore.      But I know very [little],  except from what my aunts have told  me.    We have no documents or records, except a year or two ago one of my brothers sent me some letters that my mother had written to this maiden aunt who was living with my grandparents.    And  when this baby was coming, my mother and my Aunt Belle up there had  some correspondence because Aunt Belle was going to come down and  stay,  sort of help around  and be there when the baby came.    And these are letters which were exchanged at that time, and  it's the only document that I had ever seen pertaining to my mother.    But in thatI've always thought this was sort of a sweet 11 kind of businessshe was telling my aunt about how we were getting along. And she said we were fine and that John Cathcartthat's our uncle-in- law that we lived with later onhad brought the children a little white lamb and they were intrigued and were very busy taking care of the lamb. [Laughter] There were three letters, I think. Well, that never turned out. I guess my aunt came down to the funeral and nothing else. M.F.i What about your father? You knew him much better. MacDonald: Oh, yes. M.F.i  He didn't die until you were an older child. MacDonaldi I was about eleven,  I guess,  when he died. M.F.i  What kind of influence did  he have on you? MacDonald: A very great influence.    He was a very fine-looking man and had a beautiful voice, both singing and speaking.    And  he had principles.    I've often wondered  what he would have done had he been living during this integration thing, but I have some very vivid recollections of him in this connection.    There used to be a black minister in one of the black churches in Winnsboro.    He was black as tar.    His name was Brother Collins,  and Brother Collins had a clerical collar, which my father never did have, and he wore a Panama hat.    And he used  to use my father's library, and he was back and forth, and apparently they had  some congenial basis.    And Brother Collins used to come back and forth to borrow books,  and he'd stay up there an hour or so.    My father had his study on the second floor of the house.    So Brother Collins would  come to the door and 12 go upstairs.    One day he was coming to see my father,  and our housekeeper answered  the door,  and  she told him to go around  to the back.    And my father came down,  and  I remember yet how sternly he spoke to her.    He said,  "Brother Collins is a man of the cloth, and when he knocks on this door he comes in the front door and  comes up these steps."    That indicated  something;  I don't know just what. Then we lived  right in the middle,  let's say, of the town; the black children's school was over here; we went to school over there.    And when school was out, the little blacks and the little whites would meet just about on the block where we lived.    I don't remember any malice or anything about this by way of attitudes,  but what we used to do was to lock arms and  push the little black children off the pavement, make them walk in the ditch.    And my father was upstairs in this tall sort of house; he looked down and  he saw this little incident that had  happened every day for eternity backwards.    He saw this,  and  he came down and he brought us in and  took us up to his study,  and he gave us one good  sermon that every person alive was God's child,  and  you d id not [laughter] go around  pushing them off the street that way.    That they should  walk the streets the way we walked the streets, and if we ever transgressed that again we were going to catch it.    That is just as vivid  to me as the day it happened. He was a good theologian,  I'm told,  but I have no recollection. Unfortunately,  when the house at Adgers burned,  the adjacent wooden buildings burned,  and in one of those was a lot of furniture and my father's papers,  two or three barrels of sermons and  I don't know what 13 else.    But it was the stuff that was packed up when we were moved from Chester. BEGIN SIDE II TAPE I MacDonald:   ... or what kind of attitude,  but I don't remember enough about that end of it, except he was supposed to be a very gifted minister. M.F.i Do you remember going to hear him preach? MacDonald: Oh,  yes,  I used to go every Sunday.    [Laughter]    There wasn't any question; you went.    You didn't have to go at night if you didn't want to,  but I always liked  to go at night because something about the lights attracted me.    I used to sit on the front seat right in front of the pulpit [laughter],  and  I couldn't stay awake.    And there was a very nice lady in the congregation that sat in the seat back.    When she'd  see me kind of nod,  she would  just slip around her seat and sit at the end of my seat and  pull me down.    I would sleep during the sermon [laughter] on the front pew with the lady in the congregation helping me out.    But I don't remember anything.    I remember what a pleasant voice my father had.    And his singing voice was nice.    I'll have to tell you one good  story on my ancestors on my mother's side.    You see, the Associate Reformed  Presbyterians, the psalm-singers,  have loosened  up a good bit now; you can have most any kind of music in the church.    But in the old days you didn't have anything; a musical instrument was popery.    And  hymns were 14 heathenish.    And when we were living out in Pineville,  I remember being puzzled.    On Sunday my grandmother and my aunt and all the children got into a surrey with the fringe on top,  and  we went up to the Steel Creek Church,  Central Church it was called,  where my father In the old days had  been the pastor.    And my grandfather hitched up a buggy and  went over to Pineville,  and  I always thought that was funny.    And then when I grew up enough to know about these things, I was told  that my great-uncle, my [grand]father*s brother,  who was a                      he had a little tuning fork,  and  he used to lead the singingwent to another church,  where there were hymns being sung, and there the                           didn't come that day or there was something wrong.    And this great-uncle of mine was asked  to lead  the singing,  and he got out his little tuning fork and got his pitch and his note,  and  he led  the singing.    And  the elders in his own church heard about this, and they brought him up on charges for this infraction.    And he refused  to be called on charges,  and my grandfather agreed with him, and from that time on those two old gentlemen went to the Presbyterian Church in Pineville where they could sing heathen songs if [laughter] they were on the menu that day. I don't know how to describe it, but they were very tight.    I have said  very often that nobody could understand  Wood row Wilson if they did not know what kind of people the Scotch Presbyterians were.    He was stubborn, and he held to a point past all reasonable doubt,  shall we say.    But that's the kind of people they were,  but they were staunch,  honest,  upstanding citizens.    But just cross their principles, 15 and  you were in trouble.    [Laughter] M.F.i Do you remember hearing anything about your father's attitudes on race especially being challenged  within the town? MacDonald: There's one other little incident on race that I remember.    When we were living in Chester,  there was a very small negro college.     It wasn't a college;  I expect it was a glorified  high school or something like that.      It had taen a mission school,  I think from the northern Methodist Church,  though I'm not sure on that point. The man who was the president or the head of it was a white man.    He was a minister and  he and my father metI don't know whether they had a ministers'  association or notand  my father thought he was a very nice person, liked  him.    And he invited  him a couple of times when there were visiting ministers or something going on at the house. And  I remember overhearing this conversation.    The man did not come to any of these socialmostly it would be come to dinnerbut he did  come over to call on my father.    I guess they were downstairs in the living room,  and  I was around,  and  I remember this man explaining to Father that he could not accept social invitations from him because he was unable to return the sociability.    He said,  "I can't invite you,  in terms of the environment of this community.    I can't invite you out there,  because [l judge he ate in the dormitory] I can't invite you to do this,  and  you can't do it.    So just don't invite me.    We will have our conversations and  we will communicate, but not on that kind of a social basis."    Now my father apparently didn't insist on going down to dinner with them.    Of course,  the man, 16 I guess, had never invited him.    [Laughter]    I don't know how you would interpret that. M.F.i  What about later when you were living with your aunt and uncle?    Did  racial issues come up at that time? MacDonald:  Not directly,  in the way that it has come up now. Out on the farm there were about twelve or fifteen negro families living on these various places, and it was almost like slavery except it wasn't slavery.    These people were free to leave.    They would  leave, and the next year they'd  come back.    My uncle apparently was a very good man to work for.    The only thing I remember that might be some little indicationI don't remember any discussion anywhere along the lineI don't know just how it came up,  but one of my uncle's fellow planters said  to him one day,  "John,  you're crazy.    You're wasting money.    Every time your men that work for you have a sick child, you send for the doctor."    And my uncle said,  "Well,  if our children are sick,  I send  for the doctor.    If these children are really sick, they need medical attention,  and I'm going to see they get it." And  then he went on to say,  "In the first place, these children are back and forth around the house,  and the first thing we know,  we'd have an epidemic of something or other.    Of course I'm going to have the doctor."    It's apparent that this other man did not have the doctor [laughter] when his workers had  sick children.    So that's the only thing I remember.    Later onand even when these white superintendents or overseers were aroundthe man who was really the leader of the black community there was my uncle's foreman,  and  his name was John Moore. 17 And if he had been white and had had an education, he'd have been the Governor of the State of South Carolina.    He was an amazing person. He could stand on the porch at the house and hoop it,  and  the men working out in the field a mile away [laughter] could hear what he said.    He was a farm worker manager during the week,  and he was a preacher on Sunday.    My uncle had built a little church up at one end of the place, and that was St.  John's,  and that's where they had  their.   .   .   . Brother Moore was the preacher at St.  John's.    He was able.    What he said  to these people around,  he gave orders precisely and to the point, and they were carried out or else.    But he didn't do it by way of cruelty;  it was respect.    These people recognized a man of unusual ability and  character.    So we had that as a.   .   .   .    I remember having an argument with my older brother once,  and  we were arguing the race question.   (I don't remember ever arguing it with the elders.)    And he said,  "Would  you like to eat dinner with John Moore?"    And  I said, "I would a darn sight rather eat dinner with John Moore than with Billy Wilson."    Billy Wilson was a ne'er-do-well tenant farmer in the area.    Did  you ever see "Tobacco Road"?    Well,  he was like the people in "Tobacco Road," and  John Moore was a man of culture.    Not in the books,  you know,  but in his attitude.    And  that created a little disturbance,  but that never went any higher than our level;  it was children's argument and talk. M.F.: Did  you get to be close to a lot of the tenant families? Did  you play with their children and  know who all of them were? MacDonald: Oh,  yes,  we knew all of them.    I didn't play with 18 them.    There weren't any girl children that lived  close to the house, but the boys played  with these children.    As a matter of fact,   just a year or two ago my older brother said  that he was walking down the street in Winnsboro,  and  this very well dressed,  fine-looking negro man stopped  him.    And  he said,   "May I ask your name,  sir?"    And  Harris told him.    And  he said  this man sort of smiled  and  said,   "You don't know me, do you?"    And  Harris said,   "No,  I don't.    You sound  a little familiar,  but I don't know you."    And  he said,   "I'm Willie Frazier." When Willie Frazier was maybe ten,  eleven,  or twelve years old,  he used to hang around the house and do little errands and  so on.    And he lived  with his grandmother,  and  where his parents were,  apparently nobody knew.    But Willie had left the area,  had  wound up in Detroit, and had  gotten a job in the automobile industry and  had  reared  a family and bought a house somewhere in Detroit.    And  he said  that he had  come back,  had  a vacation.     He said most of the people that he knew,  his kinfolksI think he had about one person who was kinfolkso he said he just decided  he'd better come back before he got too old  to make it.    So Harry said  he was just a very,  very fine-looking,  fine-acting sort of man, little old  black Willie Frazier.    I never knew many of them. You know,  in those days girls weren't supposed  to navigate around.    Up on my grandfather's farm we ran wild, but we didn't when we were at Adgers; at least I didn't.    But we got around,  I guess,  as much as we should have. M.F.*  What about ideas or views that you got about class?    You mentioned Billy Wilson,  who was a ne'er-do-well tenant farmer.    Were 19 those distinctions as Important as racial ones when you were growing up? MacDonald: I don't think so, but my aunt was great on people's behavior.     If somebody was a crude-acting person or so on,  she used to always say,  "Now just be careful.    Those aren't our kind of people," And  that would  indicate a certain class bias.    But there was never anything along the line that was what you'd  call vindictive,  these typed  points of view. M.F.:  Were there any cotton mills near you, or any mill people you had  contact with? MacDonald:  Yes.    In Winnsboro there was a mill that.   .   .   .    Have you read Broadus Mitchell's history of the cotton whatever-it-is? He talks there about the mills that were put up in order to provide work.    There was a little mill that had been put up for such purposes in Winnsboro,  not in the town but adjacent to the town.    And all the people,  in fact, my father,  I think,  had a little stock in it.    It never paid  anything [laughter],  but people had bought stock to get a little enterprise going.    And  it was a pretty bad  place,  I guess, in terms of modern standards.    They used  to work a twelve-hour day, and  it was a spinning mill.    And  if you know anything about the processes in textile manufacturing,  spinning mills have more dust and lint than the weaving department.    On a Saturday afternoon you'd go uptown,  and  you would  see mill peoplemost of them would still have their overalls onand  they'd  have little specks of lint,  sometimes even on their hair.    And  I remember we used  to say they all looked  sick. They looked kind of pasty-faced.    And between the town and the mill 20 people there was a great gulf.    They lived  in a typical mill village, and  in those days,  though I don't remember this too exactly,  I'm sure there were no facilities.    I guess there was a church down there.    But if you lived on the mill hill,  you belonged  there.    And there was no social contact in those days.    Actually,  the mill was in the county, not in the city, and  the school was the county school. M.F.i So you didn't even go to school with these children. MacDonald: No,  we didn't.    Later on they consolidated,  and  the high school students went to the same high school.     But I think right now, down in the mill community,  which has been greatly improved.   .   .   . It's now a UniRoyal setup,  and  they have sold most of the houses at very low rates.    There's no government of the mill community, as there was in the old days.    And  the children have a little bit more contact.    As a matter of fact, my sister-in-law had  this very bright young girl who went to high school,  and  she and one of the boys down at the mill were dating.    And  some people thought my sister-in-law should not have permitted  it.    And she's a gal who also knows her own mind.    She said,  "This boy is the best-behaved boy of any of the boys that have ever come in our house to see Martha Louise."    And he had, apparently,  a ne'er-do-well father, but a very nice mother.    And Mama said,  "I am not thinking about doing anything to wound this boy.    He is a very nice boy."    And  she used to illustrate. She said they went to a party up at White Oak one night, and the car broke down.    And  she was supposed  to get home,  let's say, at ten o'clock, and they didn't get home until nearly eleven.    And  instead 21 of letting her out to go in and  see the parents,  he got out and  brought her in the house and  went and apologized that he had  kept her out longer than they had  instructed, but that they'd  had  a flat tire, and  it was his fault and he was sorry.    Mama said  she didn't know many [laughter] of these slick,  upper-class boys around  in town who would have that kind of feeling and would have faced the music and not let her come in and face it alone.    So in high school days they fooled around for two or three years,  and then she went off to college and met other people and  he did  the same.    And  he is now a doctor somewhere in South Carolina.    He went into the Army and  got some GI educational benefits and went to medical school when he came out, and [laughter] he's really done very well.    But it was one of those little high school romances. M.F.: When you were growing up,  was the prevailing feeling in town about the mill that it was still a good thing to have that kind of enterprise,  that it offered  people jobs? MacDonald: Yes, I think that it was the feeling. M.F.i People weren't concerned  about the conditions? MacDonald: No.    They went to work at six o'clock.    They'd  blow the whistle at five to wake people up to get ready to  come to work. And  in the wintertime, of course, that would be dark.    And I remember, when I'd hear the whistle I'd  think,  "Gee whiz,  these poor people, getting up and going to work at this hour of the day."    But I don't think,  really,  people thought very much about it one way or the other. The only person that ever raised any,  in later years.   ...    The man 22 who succeeded my father as the pastor of the church,  when I came home to visit he always came around to see me,  and  we'd  have a talk. And he used  to say he was a little worried  about the future.    He said, "We can't continue to have two races separate,  and  something has got to happen to sort of equalize the opportunities and  so on."    But he didn't do anything about it?  I think he didn't know what to do about it. But he had an uneasy feeling about it.    But I think the citizens generally just sort of took the current situation for granted.    And then,  as time went on,  conditions down at the mill were greatly improved.    The semi-local management was out.    I think the first group that came in was a management group, the Manville-Jenks people, and they began to upgrade both the equipment in the plant and the community at large.    And  then after U.S.  Rubber came in,  they were the ones that really lifted  the face.    They landscaped  all the streets in the village and  improved  the houses.    Then,  after they got that done, they offered to sell them.    And my older brother,  who was the executive down there for most of his working life,  told me that those people sure got bargains.    They would  be five- or six-room houses.    Of course they didn't have basements, but they had  water and lights and so on.    They sold  them for about $3,000, depending a little on the location.    But they didn't try to make money.    They got tired of maintaining a community, and they just decided  to let people do their own.    And by that time wages were such, and  they made arrangements that they could  buy them on time without interest,  so practically everybody who had  any kind of ambition about such things.   ...    The houses went 23 like hotcakes, and  I think they're all now owned by the  individuals. M.F.:  I was wondering about your religious background as a child. When your father was preaching you went to  church,  but when you moved in with your aunt and uncle was religion still a very important part of .   .   . MacDonaldi Oh,  yes.    We went to Sunday school and  church every Sunday, and  there was no question unless you were sick. M.F.:  Were they very religious people? MacDonald: They were not religious people in the articulate sense.    They were very deeply religious.    And my uncle's parents, the old  folks,  were very religious.    They had  family prayers which we were invited to,  but we didn't have to go.    My younger brother always went,  and  they thought he hung the moon.     [Laughter]    Our religious environment didn't change very much from the time we moved in there,  except living in the house where there's a minister and people are coming and going and he is coming and  going on so-called good works,  it's a little bit different.    But in terms of religious attitudes,  it was very much the same.    And  we went to Sunday school and  we studied  the Bible;  we learned  the psalms.    You get me started on practically all the psalms,  I can [laughter] go right straight through with them .   .   . M.F.: [Laughter] MacDonald:  ...  up to this day.    There are little sections that I don't get,  but we learned  the Scriptures. M.F.: There was one other question I wanted to ask about your 24 family,  and that was the way women were regarded.    Were any of the women in your family ever involved  in the suffrage movement? MacDonaldi No. M.F.i Women's Club movement or anything like that? MacDonald: Oh, my aunt,  with whom we lived,  was a great clubwoman. While we were out in the  country she didn't have much chance,  but in Winnsboro she was very active in the  Women's Club,  in the DAR,  the UDC.    Does UDC mean anything to  you? M.F.i  Yes.     [Laughter] MacDonaldi I don't think she took it quite as seriously as some people did;  it was a social business.    And our house in town,  after it was fixed over,  was one of the few houses that had  central heat. Now I wish I had bought it when it went up for sale a few years ago, but it was too big a house and  too expensive to keep.    But you went in the front door off the porch,  and there was a great big wide hall and then a great big living room here and  a great big room here with French doors.    I don't like the French doors,  but for sociable purposes you opened those French doors and you had quite a great big to-do. So all of the meetings and all of the clubs and  so on during the wintertime [laughter] used  to meet there because it was more comfortable in a warm house.    And my aunt was President of the Women's Club and regent of this,  that,  and  the other.    So we grew up with a lot of that kind of activity, but it was not what you'd  call analytical, these club meetings.    There was a very famous club they called  the Cultus Club; that was the literary clubt"culture."    And they used to 25 have these programs that would be either printed or typed up for a whole year, and it would be something having to do with literature or with people in the literary world,  but no social content especially, which I think would not hold  today with the same group of people. Though I don't know; this club still goes.    I think one of my sisters-in-law belongs.    But some of my friendsI have a couple of old school friendshave been very active in it,  as their mother was. But there was practically no social (in the broad sense), analysis of social issues and conditions anywhere along the line.    But very kindly, helping attitudes.    If somebody in front of you got in trouble, no matter who it was,  there would  be somebody who'd lend  a helping hand.    And  I haven't been at home enough to really know whether what we'd  call the average person.   ...    My older brother has had some contact,  but I don't think he took it too seriously.    He was busy with a lot of other things. M.F.i Some contact with .   .   . MacDonaldi Through his United Rubber Company, UniRoyal,  connections, he has had some contacts with what is happening in the industrial world elsewhere, but I don't believe there's ever been a strike or even a threat of strike in the mill there,  which doesn't prove anything.    [Laughter] The only thing I know about my brother! back when I was active in the Summer School and  in the mill when I was writing Mill Hills, when the textile bulletin got onto us,  they had lists of names of people who were dangerous characters.    And I don't know where the circulation came from; it came through my brother's office.    And he came home [laughter] dying laughing one day.    He told me my name was on that list; I was a dangerous 26 character.    He's a very happy-go-lucky person.    He just thought it was the biggest joke that he'd  heard  in a long time.    But my next brother,  who's still living in Winnsboro,  is a graduate of Annapolis, and  he has the rather typical military training.    And  his wife does not have those attitudes, but I think she has the reputation of being sort of a religious fanatic.    She just goes after something.    But a very generous person, a very nice person.    But,  for example,  she thinks that people of the Jewish faith couldn't possibly go to Heaven.    And I said to her one day,  "I've got some awful good friends who are Jews. I don't want to go anyplace that they can't come visit me."    And  she thought that was sort of funny, but she was a little shocked  about it. She said,  "Is that right?"    And  I said,   "Sure.    I know a lot of people think they're going to Heaven,  and  I don't want to go if they're there." Well,  she doesn't take the first part,  I guess  .   .   . BEGIN  SIDE I TAPE II MacDonaldi There isn't anybody in my family who sort of shares my interests and point of view.    It hasn't made any difference at all in our personal feeling towards each other, but I've gone a very different direction from any of them except my little cousin Laughlin. Incidentally,  Laughlin had  an article in the Saturday Review a while back.    I was very surprised.    I happen to subscribe to the Saturday Review, and I happened to open it.    Here little Laughlin had the lead article.    And he was talking about the Supreme Court's violating the 27 Constitution by denying so many of these cases where the lower elements, so-called, economically and politically,  just don't get their cases into court.    It's out of the jurisdiction of the court. It was, I thought, a very well written article.    And then I happened to be talking to my niece's husband who lives in Winnsborohe is an official in UniRoyaland  they are great friends with Laughlin.    They go to Atlanta occasionally.    They always visit with Laughlin and his family.    I asked him if he knew about this article.    He said he didn't, and he didn't know anybody that took the magazine,  so I sent my copy to him.    Then he sent me back a column in the Columbia Statethat's the paper that everybody around there readswhere James Kilpatrick answered Laughlin's article and took him to task for his point of view. [Laughter] M.F.i  When you were growing up, did  your aunt or your uncle feel that because you were a girl you should have certain restrictions or you shouldn't do certain things?    Were you reared  pretty much the same as your brothers? MacDonald: Pretty much the same.    The only thing that I can think of that made any difference was that I was one girl and there were three boys.    And  I was supposed to be respected  by them.    They were [laughter] not to manhandle me.    But I was a pretty good physical type, and I could handle them [laughter] as well as they could handle me.    But there was always some kind of feeling that they tried to promote that girls ought to be respected, and you sort of looked after them.    But there was no difference.  ...    We all had, when we were beginning to go out to parties and so on, the same curfew; we were supposed to come home at 28 a certain time.    And my older brother and I were usually at the same sociable occasion.    But we all were supposed to go in and wake them up, "we are home."    And they said that when everybody got home and reported in, then [laughter] everybody could relax.    My aunt used to worry a little bit because she thought that you should take care of your complexion. She thought you shouldn't run in the sunshine and  you should be a little careful about your appearance.    And I think she rubbed that into me a little bit more than she did  into the boys.    But it was never any of this gentle rearing. M.F.i You weren't terribly oppressed by it. MacDonald No, I wasn't oppressed by it.    We were all taught manners, and the same, more or less, except I wasn't taught to tip my hat.    I remember once,  I wasn't on this trip but my uncle had taken the three boys to Columbia, and the two younger ones had just been taught to tip their hats to a lady.    You know, if you met somebody you knew,  you spoke and tipped  your hat.    Well,  they went down [laughter] walking up the streets of Columbia, and I remember my older brother coming back and telling my aunt,  "I'm never going out with these fellows again.    You know they walked up the street in Columbia,  crowds of people, tipping their hat to every woman they saw."    [Laughter]    He said,  "They just made fools of us, and  I'm just not going with them anymore."    Well, they had been over-taught their manners on that. M.F.t [Laughter] MacDonald: But I wasn't oppressed in any way.    I was pretty free, except we all had rules to go by, but there weren't female rules 29 as against the other rules. M.F.i Why do you think you went such a different route from the rest of them? MacDonaldi I don't know.    I guess maybe it's a little streak in the Harris strain of looking a little further ahead.    I don't know, except when I was in college, one year I went to the YWGA Blue Ridge Conference, and I think that probably was the first time that I had heard a sort of formal presentation.    And I don't remember what it was about.    I don't know too much about the YWGA now, but in those days it had a very forward-looking program in terms of social issues,  race. The Industrial Department was just beginning to get underway.    And this program there which I was exposed to for ten days or two weeks, I was very much impressed by what went on.    And  I bought some books; I don't even remember what they were.    But I followed up a little sort of on my own,  because Erskine College that I went to had a very fine classical curriculum but it didn't have any what we would classify now as social sciences.    It didn't even have very much history, actually. But I was kind of turning the thing over. M.F.i Do you remember any of the speakers who were at that conference or any of the leaders? MacDonald: I remember some of the YWGA people, but I don't remember the speakers. M.F.i Was there any one person or any group of people who particularly influenced you? MacDonald t A little later the people in the Industrial Department of the YWGA interested me, but at that time I don't remember any outstanding .  .  . 30 M.F.t It was just the general presentation .  .  . MacDonaldt Just the general presentation; the program in toto Interested me, and it clicked something in my temperament.    And I didn't forget it, although in a sense I did.    I sort of followed along generally.    Then when I got out of college I went to Columbia and took an M.A.  in comparative literature, mostly I had more of that in my background.    And then I taught for a couple of years, and I taught, among other things, English composition.    And  I had taken as a freshman in college a course in English composition that's the best course I've ever taken in all of my [laughter] various stages of education.    We were taught to write, but the main thing was the organization of ideas, analysis and orderly presentation.    And when I was teaching in this woman's college of Due West (it's now part of Erskine College),  I taught that.    And I was like my old  teacher.    I could  not see how you could teach that without having the students do a great deal of writing.    And I couldn't figure how you could have them write without reading the papers very carefully and making comments on them.    And  I found it a very great burden on my eyes. And I had gone again to a Blue Ridge ConferenceI guess I was there twiceand I thought I ought to change my vocation, probably.    And there was a person in Winnsboro who had been one of the national secretaries in the YWGA.    Her name was Margaret Flanagan.    I guess she was in the Student Division of the YW then, and I talked to her about it.    She was at home on vacation, and I had known her; her mother and my father were very good friends.    And every time I came 31 home my aunt had me go up and call on Mrs. Flanagan, which I did and I enjoyed it because she was a very lovely person.    But Margaret was there at that time, and I had seen her off and on and I had seen her at Blue Ridge.    And I told her that I was kind of thinking maybe I should do something else, and she said,  "Well, why don't you go to the YWGA Training School and  go into the YW?    With your education, you'll just have to take a few concentrated  courses, and you can do it in a summer.    And there'll be a job for you the minute you get out." So I thought it over for the next year, and then I decided to do it. And then that following summer I went to New York and went to the YWGA Training School, and I think I spent six or eight weeks there. And then I was offered this job at Greensboro; that's how I happened to get to Greensboro.    And while I was there, through the student program there was more and more of the industrial emphasis.    And that's when this kind of solidified  with me.    And while I was there I joined one summer one of those student work projects, and I went to Atlanta and worked in a cotton mill down at Eastpoint.    I worked the night shift, twelve hours, six to six.    I was still in Greensboro, you see, but I did that over one summer.    And I decided, well, this is really very interesting. M.F.i How long did that program last, the summer program in Atlanta? MacDonaldi Six or eight weeks, two months, approximately.    And I said, "Well, if I am going to go into this, I've got to know more than I know."    So the next question was, what would be the next step? At that time, everybody who wanted to know went to the London School 32 of Economics.    That's when Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Harold Lasky, and Ginsberg the anthropologist were the reigning group.    And I thought, well, maybe that would be the thing to do.    And I had a year to think that over, and I decided to do it.    And I resigned in Greensboro, and that September.  ...    In the meantime I had gone to the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers for two summers.    And while I was there, the first two summers I was the tutor for the person who taught the English course, Lillian Hersteln, who is an ancient soul, just a character all in herself.    She is in some kind of a nursing home in Chicago.    And I did that, still in the special field of English, and somehow that wasn't quite right.    So the sum and substance of it, I resigned Greensboro and got hold of enough money, and I took myself off to the London School of Economics to learn social sciences.    And I had never had any course that would be classified that way except one history course in college.    So I went over there just [laughter] a blank page.    I had to really start from scratch.    And it was a wonderful experience.    In the meantime, the first time the Labor Government was In office, the Webbs weren't around, because they were working [laughter] for the Labor Government.    But especially Beatrice Webb used to come back very often.    And I had many interesting kinds of experiences, mostly because I was very interested in finding out as much as I could.    I studied very hard.    But there was a group of people who were approximately the same age.    The only person who was not on the make was Frank Graham.    At that time he had been a history professor at Chapel Hill.    But he was over there.    That's when I got to know him real well, and then later on in the Summer School we became 33 very close friends.    We just went everywhere and did everything. We took time off when the Labor Conference was held somewhere in London, and we all went down.    Putting that all together, you see, I got on the track that I must get a good foundation, that you shouldn't go off half-cocked on these matters of social and economic change, revolution, or whatever it is, without having knowledge.    And along the line I had met up with a lot of people that seemed to me that were talking and didn't have the substance to sustain their point of view. M.F.: I wanted to ask a few things about when you went to college and how you picked the college you went to. MacDonaldt When I was going to college, the place to go at that time was the College for Women in Columbia, South Carolina.    And all of the people in Winnsboro either went to Winthrop College, which was a state woman's college, or they went to the College for Women.    And I went to the College for Women.    I got a scholarship.    I haven't mentioned in this, we never had very much money.    The MacDonald children [laughter] had practically nothing.    But we were maintained by our relatives most of the time.    But when college came,  I really didn't have on my own initiative quite enough money. M.F.i Did you ever think of going north to school, or did you want to do that at all? MacDonaldi I didn't at that time.    I went to the College for Women; that's where I wanted to go.    And I applied and I got a scholarship down there.    It was a working scholarship; you had to sit down three 34 nights a week and answer the phone.    And you could study and read, and the phone [laughter] didn't ring very much.    But I went down there for my freshman year, and it was a very nice experience.    That's when I had this very fine course in English composition.    I thought at that time, by the time I was twenty-five I would have written six literary masterpieces [laughter] and so on.    This teacher was a very inspiring teacher, and we just worked our little toes off. M.F.i What was her name? MacDonaldt Her name was Jane Ketchin.    She lived in Winnsboro. I had known her all my life.    And she took a certain interest in me because she was my uncle's cousin, and she had been in the house. She was much older than I was, but she always came to see the old folks when she was home.    The head of the school was a woman named Miss Euphemia McClintock.    She was a daughter of a Scotch Presbyterian, Associate Reformed Presbyterian, minister, too.    But she was a very gifted person.    She was a graduate of Goucher College.    She had majored in sociology.    And I don't know what she did in the meantime, but she wound up being President of this school.    And  she spent the money that was available for the school for good teachers.    The plant and the physical equipment left a lot to be desired, but everybody on that faculty was a gifted teacher, at least the five or six that I came in contact with.    That had been originally a Presbyterian school. This was 1914, I guess, and the War was on and the school was running into very serious financial difficulties.    And Miss McClintock and some of her advisers hatched up the idea that the school should be merged  with 35 the University, which was over a few blocks away, and have this coordinate relationship like Columbia and Barnard College.    That was tossed around, and it was decided to do it.    There wasn't much of a library at this school; if we had any elaborate thing to do, we had privileges to go over to the University Library.    So there was some sort of a very small, but the connection was there.    And this was decided upon by the trustees and by the trustees of the University. And Miss McClintock had said,  "Don't announce this until I have a chance to call the students together and explain it to them."    Well, somewhere along the line, about that time the Presbyterian hierarchy said, "No, you can't do that; that's our school."    And that was a little surprise, but I guess technically and legalistically the tie had never been formally cut.    And they raised such a to-do about it that the trustees of the University said,  "We'd  better not go through with this until they settle it."    And the trustees of the college felt that they couldn't do anything, but what they finally did was to say to the Presbyterians, "All right, you take it."    And they said, "Okay, we will, and we will combine it with Ghicora, which at that time was up, I guess, in Greenville.    And we just considered Ghicora way down, academically and socially and every way.    It just was no school at all.    But they were going to move Ghicora down.    We went down to breakfast one morning.    And there was a great big back lobby kind of place, and that's where we got our newspapers.    And almost all the freshman English class subscribed to the newspaper.    Picked up the newspaper and there on the front page was a story that the 36 College for Women was going to be merged with Ghicora.    Well, you talk about student mobs, uprisings [laughter], and strikes.    The students just nearly tore the place to pieces.    Nobody went to class that day, and there was a howl like nobody's business.    Finally Miss McClintock was able to use her authority, and she got us into the chapel and sat us down and she said,  "This is what has happened, and I wanted to tell you about it but somebody told the story to the newspapers, and that's the reason you weren't notified by me."    Well, the point is that about ninety percent of the students didn't return. We wouldn't go to Ghicora; that was just it.    So Miss McClintock, who was interested in me because her father and my father had been friends, called me in and she said,  "What are you going to do?"    And I said, "Well, I don't know what I'm going to do, but I know what I'm not going to do.    I'm not coming back here."    And she said, "Would you like to go to Goucher?"    And I said,  "Yes."   And she said, "Well, I'm going to see about getting you a scholarship.    I know you can't go without some financial help."    So she got me a scholarship to Goucher, and I went home and we discussed it.    At that time I was in a rather serious situati on with respect to my eyes.    And the elders would have let me go, but nobody thought that I should go that far away.  (It seemed far away then.)    I shouldn't go that far, and I shouldn't get into a situation where I would get in the middle of something and I'd have to quit because of my eyes.    Because the doctors had told my father that I probably would never go to college and I couldn't take music lessons, which didn't take anything from my pleasure.    But we had a long conversation about it, and I decided that 37 I had better not go against the.  ...    I guess I didn't want to [laughter] that badly.    The alternative was to go to either the Due West Women's College, where I later on taught, or go to Erskine. They were both in the same little town.    And Erskine's academic standards were much better, so I said, "Well, I'll go to Erskine." And I went there and entered the sophomore class and went through to graduate in 1918.    And as I said, while I was there I took Latin, Greek, Bible, Shakespeare, literature, history.    It was old-fashioned, teacher at one end, student at the other.    And I learned a lot, because you were called on every day in class.    Classes were small; the school was small.    And every day whoever was teaching that class, everybody got pointed to.    And if you hadn't done your homework, if you weren't ready to speak up, you just got a low mark.    But I have never regretted, in a way, that I had that kind of undergraduate education, because I did learn to study, to concentrate.    And in those days the college was coeducational, but it was not really coeducation.    It was a boys' school where girls were permitted to go.    So we had a separate dormitory and a literary society, and we had a little unit of the YWGA. M.F.i Were you active in that? MacDonald1 Reasonably, but it was so small there wasn't any activity.    We had no social activity.    We played tennis, because we had a tennis court down by the girls' dorm.    But there wasn't anything to take a campus course in, so the result was that you socialized. a little with your fellow students, and then the rest of the time you studied; you turned to your books.    I learned to love walking when I was there.    We used to go down to the corner store and buy 38 for a nickel a bag of peanuts about this highI would say nearly a poundand a bunch of apples.    There were four or five of us that liked to do this, and we'd spend the whole afternoon walking around and around.    It was undeveloped countryside.    And eat apples and eat [laughter] peanuts.    We probably put on too much weight; I don't know. But it was that kind of an education.    And my older brother was big man on campus, and he was president of the student body and this, that, and the other.    And he was smart enough, but he just never got around to his books.    We never had a class together; he was a class ahead of me.    And in those days you went to class by class, not by subject matter.    But the same professor had Harrison one class, and then the next hour or two he had me.    So he hadn't done his work very well, and he didn't show up as a very bright lad.    And this old professor said,  "Mr. MacDonald, it seems to me that you ought to do a little better.    Your sister is an excellent student and always comes well prepared.    Why don't you emulate her?"    [Laughter] It made Harris so mad I think he wanted to come beat me up.    [Laughter] M.F.i [Laughter] MacDonaldi But that's the kind of school it was, very limited, very religious.    We had Bible classes on Sunday and we got credit for it.    We took exams, but we didn't take the exam on Sunday.    We went to class and we studied.    We were not supposed to study on Sunday, but everybody did.    They used to call that little college down there "ARP Heaven."    You know, It's where everybody went one time or another, and people came back to. 39 M.F.i What did you plan to do when you got out? MacDonaldi I didn't know exactly; I thought I would teach. And when I was a senior in college, there was a gentleman came there to lecture. He was a classmate of my father in college and in the seminary. And he had been a missionary to India. And in Montgomery, India, which is now in Pakistan, there was a school called the MacDonald School, and it was named for my father. This Mr. Ranson had gone out there and had established this school, and he appealed to some of his friends to help raise money for it, and my father was one of those who raised a good bit of money. So Mr. Ranson named this school the MacDonald School, partly because of his long friendship with my father and partly because my father had helped him raise the money, gone around speaking for him and so on. Mr. Ranson was back. He came to see me, and he said, "You know, we need an English teacher out there. Would you like to go back with me? I'm going back early in September." This was in the spring. BEGIN SIDE II TAPE II MacDonaldi I said, "Well, I'll think this over, but I have to go home and see my folks about it." And I went home one weekend and talked to my aunt and uncle, and they said, "Well, you're going awfully far away." [Laughter] M.F.i If Goucher was far, India was a lot farther. [Laughter] MacDonaldi Yes, this was awful far away. And my uncle said, 40 "We're not going to make this decision for you.    You must do what you feel you want to do.    But the only thing I insist on, you go to Columbia and see Dr. Moore [about my eyes]."    And I took this seriously enough so that I did go down to Dr. Moore.    And he looked up something about the climate.    I could see the little man yet, shaking his head.    He said,  "You should not go in that climate.    The incidence of serious eye problems all over the place, and it's hot as get-out.    Unless you feel a missionary call, I don't think you should go."    So with this tentative feeling of my aunt and uncle, and they were just expressing their opinion; they thought maybe it wasn't the thing to do, but if I wanted to do it, okay, but see Dr. Moore.    Well, having seen him,  I thought,  "Well, I'd better not.    If anything happens to me, they've got to take me on."    So I wrote Mr. Ranson and told him I thought I'd better not go.    So as an alternative I took myself up to New York to Columbia University.    [Laughter] M.F.i Why did  you go to Columbia? MacDonaldi Oh, down south at that time, Columbia was the only place to go to, if you wanted to go to a graduate school. M.F.i Had some of your teachers gone to Columbia? MacDonaldt I don't think so.    It was just the general feeling around the place. M.F.i So you went up to Columbia in comparative literature. MacDonald t Yes. M.F.i Where did you live in New York at that time? MacDonald i I lived on Morningside Drive.    I was joined by an old friend from Chester.    Her father was one of my father's parishioners, 41 and I had known them and we'd had some contact since.    She left the College for Women and went to Hollins College.    And we got together, and  we decided we'd go up and take an apartment together.    And we were there the fall of that terrible flu epidemic.    Margaret got the flu and she was very ill, and  I took care of her because you couldn't get into a hospital.    But the University sent a doctor or a nurse around every day.    But in the meantime I sort of held things together. [interruption in tape.] M.F.i This was Margaret what-was-her-last-name? MacDonaldi Margaret White.    Her name is Margaret McCauley.    And she married later on, lived in Chester, and still is there. M.F.i You were studying comparative literature at Columbia. Was that a one-year program or two-year program? MacDonaldi I was taking the program for the master's degree. At that time Erskine, as is not true now, was not an accredited school at Columbia.    So I was admitted to the graduate program under condition. I could take whatever I wanted, and then they would decide at the end of the year when I took my examinations on the courses that I had taken what additional work I would need in order to make up this little deficiency in my undergraduate education.    In the meantime Miss McClintock, who had been the President of the College for Women, had. come to Columbia and was head of Johnson Hall.    At that time that was the one separate women's dormitory at Columbia for graduate women students.    She ran the hall, and later on she went up to Boston and established a different kind of school.    And I had gone to see her, and I had discussed this thing that they said.    They had written me that I was admitted on 42 condition, and I asked her what about it.    And she said,  "I think that with your disability, you ought not to take the full course for the master's.    Drop some points on this and take the fall semester and see how it goes."    So I followed her advice, and I got along all right.    And then I took the extra course for the second semester, but I still missed out a little [laughter] on the first semester because I had not taken the full pointage.    I took the exams, though, at the end of the first semester, and I did very well on those, I guess, because they called me in and said,  "We will lift the condition if the rest of your work turns out to be as good as this has been." So I said, "That's okay."    So the second semester I did the full course, but I stayed over in the summer and took this one course that I missed out on.    And I had done a little on my thesis but not very much, but I stayed the whole summer up there.    And for six weeks I went to school, and the rest of the time I completed the work on my thesis. And by September I had finished the thesis, and in that awarding degrees in what they called then the fall semester, I got the degree. And in the meantime I had gone home.    And by that time my aunt and uncle had moved back to the country, when all the birds had flown.    So he had not been very well, and the old folks had died. And I wasn't sure when I got back; I had not applied for jobs because my aunt had written and said, "You've worked hard.    Why don't you stay at home for a while, for one year, and catch up with yourself?"    And she said they'd like to have me and so on.    So I thought, "Well, that's a good idea." I did feel [laughter] an awful lot of pressure. M.F.i The pressure you'd been under in New York during that year 43 was academic.    You weren'tor were youinvolved at all in the city or .  .  . MacDonaldi No.    What Margaret and I did, we saw New York from A to Z.    We went everywhere; we did everything.    [Laughter]    We went to West Point; we did around.    And Margaret was taking domestic science. She had decided somewhere along the line that the thing you ought to do was to take something that was practical.   That was her ideai practical. Apply it right now.    Her family was pretty well-to-do in Chester. She had never even boiled an egg, I don't think, and here she went Into these cookery classes.    She was bright as a minute and she's a very attractive, talkative kind of person.    She made friends and so on. Well, this teacher took an interest in her and said, "What you've got to do is to learn how to handle yourself in the kitchen.    You don't know one pan from the other.    How are you living?"    And she said, "We have an apartment."    "Can you cook?"    She said, "Yes, we have a little kitchenette."    She said,  "Well, you spend some time at home mixing the ingredients and putting it in the stove or on the stove and cooking."    [Laughter]    So Margaret called me her "experiment station." M.F.i [Laughter] MacDonaldt She used to do all sorts of cooking.    And she wouldn't let me touch it: "I've got to practice; I've got to practice."    [Laughter] So we spent the time we weren't running around seeing the city.    We went to shows.    We went to the opera one night, and I didn't realize at that time.  .  .  .    The only opera I had ever heard.  ...    I had 44 been to several shows.    My uncle used to take us to Columbia.    I saw Maude Adams, I think, in "Peter Pan," the famous physician of Peter Pan.    We went down and it was always a big occasion.    We'd stay at the hotel overnight.    You know, we were country kids; that was a big deal.    And we had much classical music on phonograph records, and that's all I'd ever known about opera.    But we had some Caruso and  Galli-Curcl and Fritz Chrysler, what they called in those days the Red Seal Records. And we went to the opera.    Of course, I never had very much money. Margaret could have sat where she wanted to, but she was very considerate.    She always sat where I had to sit.    So we were way up in the balcony of the old Metropolitan.    Well,  I thought you had to see. I just strained my eyes [laughter] so I couldn't read for two or three days.    And then somebody said, "Oh, you should have known.    When you're going to the opera, what you see is not important.    You can shut your eyes and listen."    So that was the kind of thing that Margaret and I specialized in. M.F.i So you went back and stayed  .  .  . MacDonaldi I went back.    I went out to the Adger Plantation. Sometime in the fall a friend of minein fact, the girl that grew up next door to us in Winnsborowas going to San Francisco to marry a young man who was in the Army.    He was going to the Philippines, and they were going to get married.    And she and her family and one of her very close relatives outside the immediate family were going out so that they could have somebody in the family for the wedding. And this relative was the Red  Cross agent in Fairfield County [s.C.], 45 and she asked me if I would substitute for her for this month or so that she was going to be away.    So I did, and I had that little employment.    She wanted to pay me her salary, which I wouldn't take because I was living at home.    And I found it very interesting.    I had this little old runabout car, and I ran around in the county and did a few things for the Red  Cross,  collecting money, mostly, as I recall.    And then that was over, and about that time I got a communication from the President of the Women's College in Due West, which was the women's college in this little town where I had gone to school.    And the English teacher had broken down in healthI think she had a mental breakdown, actuallyin the middle of the year, and he asked me if I would consider coming over in February, picking up the second semester.    And by that time things had  sort of straightened out at home, and my aunt and uncle had decided they were going to move back to town.    And they said,  "This sounds like something you ought to do if you want to do it."    So I went over there, and I stayed that year and I guess another.    I guess I spent two full years and one semester.    And it was during that time that I was sort of deciding that I could not do this amount of handwritten paperwork.    And at the end of that period I went to the YWGA Training School.    And from there I went to Greensboro.    From Greensboro I went to London.    And while I was in London I had classes with Harold Lasky, and I had a series of lectures that Beatrice and Sidney Webb sort of talked back and forth.    But the man that taught the sociology courses, Leonard T. Hobhouse (I don't know whether his books are read anymore), but about that time he had written in the field of sort of social philosophy, I would  call It. 46 He had written two or three books that were the going books.    He was ill and was not able to travel in and out to the school, so his courses were cancelled.    But for some reason he was very interested in American students.    And I think Talcott Parsons, who was the big gun up at Harvard, arranged this.    [Laughter]   Professor Hobhouse told Talcott if he would get together about eight or ten American students that he thought would make a nice group, if we would come out once a week to his househe lived someplace; it used to take us about an hour to get out therehe would love to have us come,  just as an Informal.  .  .  . He said"No formal class; just come out and let us have a little seminar. I would enjoy it, and maybe you people would get something out of it." So Talcott asked me and Helen Walker (the girl that he eventually married) and Ada Halslett (who married somebody and sort of dropped out of the field), McKee Rosen (who wound up at the University of Minnesota) and a couple of other people.    And we used to go out every Tuesday night.    We'd meet together and have dinner and then we'd go out (it was arranged that we would spend two hours and no more) to see Professor Hobhouse.    And after a few formalities of greetings and chitchat, he conducted this little session like a graduate seminar, where he did most of the talking (which is not my idea of a seminar). But it was an informal kind of thing.    We could interrupt, and he would turn to ask us this, that, and the other.    And when the end of the year came, I had to decide; I wasn't anywhere close to a degree, and I knew I must pursue that.    And I was going to run out of money,  but of course I could get money from the family.    And I called up Professor Hobhouse and asked him if I could come out.    So I went out one afternoon, not 47 with the seminar people, and I told him I was trying to make up my mind on this and that I knew him best of anybody that I had  "sat under," as they say in Britain.    And he said,  "Well, what are you interested in, aside from what we've talked about here In the seminar?"    And I told him I was getting more and more interested in the industrial situation, economics and the social aspects of industrial living.    And I said, "I'm also interested in race."    Because in the seminarand I've forgotten how it came up-we had had a lot of discussion.    And Frank Graham was in this group; he didn't come all the time, but he was part of the group. But he and I were the only people who represented the southern end of the country.    And  Professor Hobhouse said,  "Well,  with your interests, I think you ought to go back home.    You can stay over here and you can study, but, so far as your field of interest and where you will eventually work, you will be sort of studying in a vacuum.    If you were my daughter, I would not tell you what to do but I would strongly advise you to go on back to the States and finish your graduate work, if you want to get a degree, there.    Because you've had this experience here and you know what it's like, and go back where your roots will eventually go down."    So all in all, I decided I'd come back.    And I went to Columbia for one semester.    In the meantime I had been doing some parttime work with the YW Editorial, rewriting some of their old stuff.    In the meantime I had gotten this chance to do research with the Ford money, and that would involve pulling up roots and going south, and I figured I would get a dissertation out of it.    And I went to talk to the only man on the economics faculty at Columbia, the labor man, whose name was Henry Seager, a very, very nice man.    And I told him 48 what I was going to do the second semester, that I would be gone for some months, and I was thinking of developing this into a dissertation. And he said,  "Well, that's interesting, but in the first place I'm going to retire fairly soon, and in the second place that's just a little out of my field.    It's the borderline of sociology, economics." I think he would have taken me on as one of his students, but I had the feeling that it would be kind of against his best feeling about it.    And about that time I heard that Professor [Willard] Atkins, whom I had known when he was down at Chapel Hill, was going to come to New York University. And Willard had been to one of the industrial conferences, the one that I went to the summer that I had  just come back from London.    This conference was held over at Lake Junaluska, the Methodist campground, and I had been asked to talk about the Labor Party In Great Britain. And  Willard and I struck up a friendship.    And he went on back to Chapel Hill, and then that fall I went on back to New York and did that one semester at Columbia.    Then when he came up I heard he was coming, so after he got there I went down to talk to him about it.    And he was just enthusiastic, and he said, "Isn't there anybody at Columbia who will work on this?"    And I said, "Seager is the only person, and he's not interested."    And he said,  "Well, if you want to, come down here. We don't have as prestigious a graduate school as Columbia does, but you'll get very good training here, and I'll see you through on this dissertation.    And I'll also see what I can do [i guess, as a matter of fact,  Willard had been there a year when all this transpired].   .  .  . I will get you a teaching fellowship, and you can support yourself on that, and you won't have to run around doing this, that, and the other." 49 And I thought it over and I thought, "Well, that sounds good."    Because if you're going to do something, you want to work with somebody that you have rapport with; you know how that is.    And he put in for a teaching fellowship, and the dean of the college at that time turned it down because he said women could not teach economics.    And Willard hadn't been there long enough, I guess, or maybe he didn't feel that the Issue was strong enough.    He didn't want to fight it.    So I was turned down.    I'm going to get the [laughter] National Organization of Women onto them.    But it was the first time in my life I had had this kind of sort of blank, unmistakable discrimination because of sex. But Willard  sort of eased the thing off,  because he got me a fellowship without teaching, which paid almost the same amount of money.    So I could spend that yearliving rather frugally, but I didn't have to call on the family for money;    I was self-supportingand work on my thesis and  continue to get some credits toward  the Ph.D.    That's how I happened to land at New York University.    Then the next year the dean died. M.F.i [Laughter] MacDonald t [laughter]   And the year after that Willard appointed me and it went through.    And I got there, and I had not meant to stay forever.    But in those days a woman economist didn't get offered jobs except in women's colleges.    And I was offered a job at Wellesley once, back after I had gotten my Ph.D.    But in the meantime I had  gotten sort of in stride at New York University.    It was long before there was any great to-do about discrimination in race.    On race it has always been good.    I had all sorts of students.    The black ones were 50 the ones that [laughter] I liked the best,  in a way, because they all came in with conditions, as I had, and I took special interest in them. And Willard Atkins was a very fine chairman, and he believed in leaving people pretty much to find their own level as long as they turned in their grades promptly and so on.    He said,  "What you do Is your own business."    And I had begun to teach one class in the Graduate School, and the man who was the head of the Economics Department in the Graduate School encouraged me.    He liked me and he thought my work was good; I had taken some courses with him.    And he had asked me to come in and give this one course in the Graduate School.    And I enjoyed the graduate students because in New York University there are practically no fulltime graduate students.    They're coming to night school or Saturday school. They came from the state Labor Department, from very interesting kinds of vocational backgrounds, and I found that whole thing very stimulating. And I thought, "Gee, if I go up to Wellesley, way off.  ..."    [laughter] I had never been there at that time.    I've been there since, and  I still agree with myself.    But I thought my opportunities and the life that I was living was much more stimulating and interesting.    And Willard had said that as long as he was there, I could look forward to a good career, and so I turned that down.    I also was offered a job at Hollins College, and I just figured,  "Well, I like what I'm doing; I like the people around; I'm pretty free to follow my own bent."    So I just stayed around and went through the hierarchy until I got as far as I could go. M.F.i You said that your experiences with the YWGA were largely 51 responsible for both changing your career from teaching English into economics, and also for all of the kinds of progressive work and concern with social issues that you went on to have later.    I wondered if you would talk a little more specifically about the experiences that you had with the Y, like the first contacts that you had with the Y. MacDonaldi The first contacts I had were as a student going to the student conferences.    I did that two summers while I was an undergraduate student,at Blue Ridge, up at Black Mountain [N.G.].    And in both of those, this was a time when the industrial women's interest in the Y was sort of getting underway.    And in both of those conferences there were parts of the program devoted to that, and then there were what they now call workshops on industrial women's problems.    And I went to those.    And at those student conferences there were a few sort of token people from the industrial clubs in the Y's in the southern region.    A few of them were there and  I met them. M.F.t  You mean the workers from the  .   .   . MacDonaldi They were workers, just a few.    I remember there was a girl who later on I met up with at the Bryn Mawr Summer School, a girl from Winston-Salem who worked in a cigarette factory or something of the kind.    And there were a couple of others.    I think there was a girl from Atlanta who was there.    And I met them and I heard them talk, and they discussed primarily their vocational problems, the conditions under which they worked.    And that began to sort of perk with me.    And then I didn't have any direct contact, except a time or two after that while I was in college the travelling student secretary 52 in the Y visited Erskine College.    As a matter of fact,  the person who came once was Margaret Flanagan,  this person from Winnsboro.    She was some years ahead of me chronologically,  but the families were friends. And she talked,  and she used to talk to us about that we had to be sure that we weren't too provincial.    Well,  I probably had  to go to the dictionary and look up what "provincial" meant.    [Laughter]    But she was talking to us about widening our horizons and getting to know and to experience things outside of our own little private world.    And I admired her,  and  I think I was impressed  by that.    Then another person came throughI think it was Margaret Clarkand she was a very different type than Margaret Flanagan,  but the same message. And  I was vulnerable at the age of eighteen or so,  and  those things sort of sank in and  I sort of                         then I went about my business. And  then as a student secretary at Greensboro,  part of my job was to carry through some of these programs,    [interruption in tape.] .   .  . one of the things we did,  we went to visit some of the industrial places around.    We went to the Vicks Chemical, where they make VapoRub and so on.    And  there's one of the biggest denim mills in the whole section at a Cone Mills on the outskirts of Greensboro,  and we went there.    These were planned for students who were interested. M.F.i How many students were interested at Greensboro when you were there? MacDonaldi Oh,  there were quite a number of them.    And  in those groups that used  to go out to the mills there'd be twelve peop le,  and that's as many as I thought you could manage very well. M.F.i How did  the mill people react to you? 53 MacDonald t They were very cooperative and sort of interested.    I can only remember one incident that gave me a little start.    Before we went I always talked to the girls and said,  "Ask all the questions that you want to ask that occur to you, but remember that we are guests and don't.  ..."    I didn't say it this way .  .  . BEGIN SIDE I TAPE III MacDonaldi  ... in the spinning department, and that's where the lint is so bad.    And then in the weaving department it is very hot. And one of the girls asked the young man who was taking us through, "The atmosphere seems so bad.    In this room it's full of lint, and in the other room it is so terribly hot.    Don't the workers object to this?" And he said,  "Oh, no, these people are like animals."    And I held my breath, because [laughter] I knew this girl fairly well, and I thought, "Gee, she's going to lash into him and tell him off."    And he was just a hireling, you know.    But she held it off until we got away, and then she just was so shocked she didn't know what in the world to do.    And she is one who pursued her interest and became an industrial secretary in the YWGA for a few years, and then she got married and moved somewhere out west.    I've lost contact with her. M.F.i Would you remember her name now? MacDonaldt Her married name is Louise Farber, but I can't remember that girl's first name.    I can see her in my mind's eye.    I don't know what happened to her when she matured a little bit, and of course she 54 was out of my ken, but she was in my circuit for only a short period of time.    But there were a lot of girls who in various ways were impressed by these experiences, and I was, too.    And we had a contact with the local YWGA in Greensboro, and at that time the General Secretary there was an old sister who really didn't know very much.    But she was succeeded by a person who was very much better and  welcomed us to come down.    They were trying to develop the industrial clubs, and she welcomed us to come down and visit, and I think some of the girls helped a little bit around the lot.    But so far as I was concerned, those were simply extensions of an experience.    And there's one other thing I remember very vividly in the fields that we've been talking about while I was there.    The YWGA office and the facility for the organization was what was called The Hut.    It was way down at the end of the campus right at the edge of some nice woods.    And I think it was a building that had been bought by the college at the end of World  War I.    It was one of those kind of pre-fab things.    It looked like a little log building, but it wasn't.    It had a great big fireplace at one end, and it must have been forty feet wide and twenty or thirty this way.    Then there were two small offices; one of those was my office and the other was the offices of the YWGA, their place of business.    And we had meetings and had guest speakers as we did constantly.    We met down there in the hut.    And one of the persons we had there was a student secretary in the YW who was a negro her name was Juliette Derlcotte who later on was Dean of Women at Taladega.    And she took a group of students to Chattanooga for some business or other, and on the way home 55 they had an automobile accident.    And she was taken to a hospital with a serious injury, and they turned her away because she was black.    And the students turned around and raced back to Chattanooga, and she died before they got there.    Well, that's a side issue.    But at this time she was a brilliant, good-looking Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley or something like that, and she had  visited and  had  come out and  had had a series of meetings, and there must have been thirty to fifty girls that had come down to the first meeting.    Then word went out that she was a very interesting person and worth listening to; the next day we had an overflow crowd [laughter].    And  in those days I couldn't invite her to dinner.    I think now I should have anyway, but it was the rule and I thought there was something more important to press for.    So I had told the girls this meeting would last until let's say five-thirty, and the gong would ring at six.    And I said,  "You go on."    I was going out with Juliette to a friend of hers in Greensboro, and  I was having dinner with them, an interracial dinner, incidentally.    But it was an interesting session, and the girls just kept on asking questions.    I closed the meeting formally, and they clustered around her and they kept on and on and on.    There must have been twelve or fifteen that were sort of listening carefully, and two or three of them were sort of taking the lead and asking questions.    Then the gong rang, and that ended it. They had to get to dinner; if they weren't there by five minutes after, they lost their meal.    So they hastily excused themselves and all went running up the half a block to get to the dining room.    And I noticed as they went out that a lot of the girls looked back.    The two of us were standing talking.    They looked back, and I didn't think much about 56 it at the time.    But the next day there must have been twelve girls that came in to me and said,  "If we didn't feel like dirt yesterday. We had sat for two hours and had listened to this wonderful person talk, and the dinner bell rang and we couldn't ask her to go in to dinner. We just felt terrible."    And [laughter] I said, "Well, that's one of those things in life" and so on.    But that made on that groupespecially that little group that stayed over after the formal meeting was over a very great impression.    And I haven't seen any of those girls lately, but I used to one way or another run into them in various places. Occasionally when I would be driving through North Carolina and stop overnight and go out to a restaurant, here [laughter] somebody would come up and it would be one of these girls.    Because most of them taught or did whatever they did.  .   .   .    A lot of the girls got free tuition or got very moderate tuition if they agreed to teach or do some positive public work for a year or two years in the state.    So they were all spread over the state.
