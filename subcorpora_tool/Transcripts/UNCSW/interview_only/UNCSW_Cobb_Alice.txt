    Alice Cobb: . . .asked her to write her autobiography.  Jacquelyn Hall: Have people wanted her to do that?  A.C.: Lots of people have asked her for her story, you know, and  she'd talk all day, you know. But if I should go there with a tape  recorder or something, . . .  J.H.: Why didn't she want her. . .?  A.C.: I don't know. I think that she's a modest kind of person  and it just never occured to her that it would be important, you know.  But, I think that there is a great deal of information that she has,  because she begin working, and she told you this in the interview  I know, way back in one of the black schools. . .she taught at Clark,  and at Payne, she was Dean at Hampton and so she was in the game, long  before it was a game. Long before it was a real social issue, she1  been a tremendous force, I think. I'm very proud of her and feel  very fortunate to have come here at Scarrit just at the time. . .you  see, she brought me here to Scarrit and sort of brought me up here  and I think I was very fortunate to have her guidance during those  years,  Interview number G-0018 in the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection,  The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.  page 2  Robert Hall: How was she looked on at Scarrit? Did she get criticism  from other faculty members?  A.C.: I think not. . .in any direct way. I think that many faculty  members thought, "Dear me, why does she waste her time when there are  so many important things to do, and she fiddles around with Fisk and  the race relations," you know, but on the other hand, we were all very  glad, of course, I say we, because I was on the faculty at the time. . .  very glad that there was somebody at Scarrit who was willing and  interested to run the interference, you know, and to. . .and Scarrit  began as a very socially oriented college, but of course, . . .when  it first came to Nashville, it was a very progressive institution.  J.H.: Why was that?  A.C.: I think perhaps because it was a c&amp;llege that the women's  division of Christian service was especially interested in and had  a good deal of voice in. . .the women's division had its headquarters  in New York Ci&#163;y and they were down her quite a lot. We were protected,  you know, from the problems that other institutions would have because  our backers in New York could support us in anything that we might  want to do, and worked very closely with the race relations program.  There was one of our young people who went down to Georgia and was  about to be fired from her job under the women's division there. She  came from Scarrit and went down there. . .because she spent the night  in the home of a black minister and his family. She did this instead  Interview number G-0018 in the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection,  The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.  page 3  of driving 150 miles back to her work. So, she stayed the night there  just before she got back and she was immediately fired from her  position.  J.H.: What was her position?  A.C.: She was a church and community worker with a number of churches  in a rural area of Georgia. So, the women's division immediately  supported Betty. They sent word that they had heard and they would give  her backing. If she couldn't work in this position, they would find  her another immediately, that they were. . .she had no feeling of being  deserted, you know. And this is the kind of thing that the women's  division did all over the South. And of course, where Scarrit was  concerned, everything we did was approved. . .1 know in my own situa  tion, when I went to Highlander School, I was given a leave of  absence from Scarrit to work at Highlander. At the same time, over  at Vanderbilt, the whole faculty of the Divinity School resigned,  including the dean, over the demonstrating that was lead by the black  students, you know, who went on to Boston. . .Jim Lawson,and this  was a great scandal at Vanderbilt. The dean was never retained, he  was never invited back. . .  J.H.: They resigned?  A.C.: Yes, in that protest against the expulsion of Jim Lawson  because Jim was leading demonstrations. All this was happening over  at Vanderbilt and meantime at Scarrit, they were quietly giving me a  Interview number G-0018 in the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection,  The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.  page 4  leave of absence, with pay, to work in a school that was under indictment  by the law. When I resigned from Scarrit. . .three times I sent a  letter of resignation, because I thought the school was being very much  embarrassed. . .a lot of publicity, very unfortunate publicity. . .  "Scarrit professor supports beer-drinking school" and that kind of  thing, you know. . .and finally, the answer from the president was,  "this is to notify you that your salary has been raised and as of next  year, we are expecting you back in September. . ." And it was this  kind of support that Scarrit gave us through these hard years.  R.H.: Which years, now?  A.C.: These were the years of the demonstrations. . .'59, '60, '61,  and I came back here then in '62, after I had had two years of absence.  And Highlander had been closed by the State legislature and all its  property had been sold at public auction and this kind of thing. So,  I came back then to Scarrit, and was received here without any problem  whatsoever. In all of this time while I was away, I was back on the  campus and was always welcome here to come and talk to the students  about what we were doing at Highlander. They came over with members  of the faculty. . .those who were willing to do it, and not all of  them were. . .and students came over to workshops that we were having  there at so, all through this time, I felt warmly supported  by my institution. . .while Vanderbilt wasn't able to do that. i can  see how a small private school was more independent than a large one,  but it was the women's division backing, I think, that had a lot to do  Interview number G-0018 in the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection,  The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.  page 5  with it.  J.H.: Where did you grow up?  A.C.: Oh, I was born in southern Indiana and came quite early to  Kentucky, so I count myself. . .  J.H.: Your family came to Kentucky?  A.C.: No, I came myself to the Pine Mountain School in Harlan County  Kentucky.  J.H. : That was after college?  A.C.: Yes, I came as what they called a "roustabout". . .this was  somebody that came. . .they went around to the sort of nicer colleges  for women, you know, like Wellesly and Vassar and I was at Western  College in Oxford, Ohio. So, they came over there, they were interested  i n having young college girls come and play around, because we could  go back and get money for Pine Mountain, see. Well, I didn't get much  money for Pine Mountain, but I did stay and was there for a number of  years.  J.H.: What kind of family did you come from? What did your father do?  A.C.: My father was a sort of a lay preacher. He was a Baptist,  extremely religious. . .my family was very conservative, fundamentalist  people, but I think very human, because I was never at any time  discouraged in any of my crazy points of view, I think. I went to a  college which was extremely middle class.  J.H.: What college was that?

J.H.: Oh yes, Western College.  A.C: Yes,. . .1 wasn't aware of the fact at that time that it was  a pretty conservative institution socially, but women's colleges were  at that time, I guess. . .  J.H.: When was that, what years were those?  A.C: Those were the years in the thirties. I was there in the  thirties and I guess I was always encouraged in some rather. . .1  guess
