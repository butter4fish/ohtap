Constance Myers: So you think that picketing helped the cause
and didn't hinder it.

Pollitzer: If they hadn't been picketing they might not have
gotten it for years. It helped it so greatly! It was only when they
picketed, it was when they had these bonfires, it was when they did every—
thing to bring it to the attention of the people. These marvelous women.
They would soak, first it was wood, in oil. And the urns in which they
lighted the bonfires were so high. And these dear little young women
would keep the fires burning as a reminder.

C.M.: Where were these binfires?

Pollitzer: In Washington, near the White House gates. And that
just infuriated the people. One after the other was taken to jail. That's

all told in this wonderful book. (The Story of the Woman's Party by Inez

 

Haynes Irwin, published by Harcourt, Brace and Co.) I have several copies;
they are Anita's. I'm not lending them to anybody. One of the dear
ladies of the NOW said "Could I borrow it?" I could let her "come around
to the house and spend days reading it, but I have no right to let it
get out of the house." I mean even with the best of intentions.

C.M.: I'll come back one day and do this. And take notes.

Pollitzer: But you asked me if the picketing helped. It was the

most marvelous strategy. I mean, when we win in war anything that is

honorable is considered right. Here we wanted to win not for the few
women who were picketing, but for the mass of women in America. who could
not speak their thoughts and who could not work to attain their rights.

C.M.: Here there bonfizes lit and kept lighted locally?

Pollitzer: No. I know of no bonfires except at the hpital. It
was to remind the Senators and the Congressmen and to remind the presi-
dent that state by state suffrage was coming. But it should be that
national amendment that had been introduced into Congress. The vote for
women, for which they had been fighting for forty-eight years , but in-
tensely fighting since 1913. The National Woman's Party was organized
January 2, 1913, and from then on the work was intense, but it became
intense, intense); and most intense aroma 191?. Then the strategy was
to do everything to bring it about before 1920. You see, there was go—
ing to be a new election in 1920 between Harding and (103:. The whole aim
was to get it speedily. And as I told you last time, at first Woodrow
Wilson seemed in a stage almost of apathy toward women's suffrage.

6.14.: Not antagonistic. just apathetic?

Pollitzer: I would say it was apathetic. Then he became inter-
ested in getting it state by state. And. he worked to get suffrage in
New York State. But the National Woman's Party. who had introduced the
national amendment. wanted that amendment passed. Then the thing
was to get Woodrow Wilson. He then be—
came really, deeply interested in having the amendment mead. During
ratification. when it was brought up before the different states. he
himself telegraphed the different governors in states where ratification

would be difficult. In other words, later, he felt it was important.

Now, the point was, was he feeling that way mostly because of wanting
women to vote or was it because he wanted to get the women's vote for
the Dunocratic party? And consequently their strategy was pitting Demo-
crat against Republican. It was Harding that worked SO 'haxdnoh so
hard it waSa-to get that ratification in Tennessee. It was Ming then.
But it was also Wilson than working on the Democrats of Tennessee,
through the state machinery, to get the governor to get the Democrats of
the legislature to vote for it. It was a regular seesaw. Now we have
more Democrats; now we have more Republicans.

C.M.= What do you think he felt in his innermost being on this
question? Do you believe he truly wanted the vote for women or was it
politically expedient?

Pollitzer: I know definitely it was politically emedient. In
his heart, being the man he was, I feel, am. I lava Woodrow Wilson, I
really feel that he must have seen that the cause was right and just.

In this book one of the writers said it was something like a. child ready

to go to college. And nagging her father, nagging him, please to get

the money so she could go to college. And although it seemed as though

she was torturing her father all the time, yet in her heart she dearly

loved her father. And that was the way it was described here. They ‘
made Woodrow Wilson almost, we might say, ashamed that our country did

not have full democracy: when in Russia, in Austria, in Germany and in

other parts of Europe they did have women voting. And. here Wilson, at

the Paris peace talks, urging democracy for all nations, and he did not

say "but we do not have it in our own country."

(Interruption)

C.M.: We were talking last time about your visit to Susan B.
Anthony's home in Rochester and the tape cut off before we got through
with that little episode. I would like to hear more about it. I know
that you had been at the University of Michigan and you stopped through
Rochester en route to see your sister Anita Pollitzer, in New York.

You had friends there, in Rochester, and you met the Masher sisters and
visited them. That's where we left off.

Pollitzer: The Mosher sisters invited us to lunch. And they said
one of the nicest places would be at the new airport in Rochester. The
Moshers seemed to be very fond of us becuase, when their aunt,Susan B.
Anthony}was honored by being in the New York University Hall of Fame, it was
Anita, my sister, who handed the wreath to the niece, either Miss Marion
Mosher or her sister Florence Mosher, to place the wreath. I don't
know that you've been to the Hall of Fame. But it's a glorious out
of doors place where those who deserve to be honored are honored in the
Hall of Fame at New York University. Not downtown near 8th Street, but
Washington Heights. Through suffrage Anita had known the two sisters.

C.M.: So they were active, too.

Pollitzer: I do not know to what extent. But Anita spent quite
a while in Rochester working for. . . well, I'm not sure whether it was
working for suffrage or for the Equial Rights Amendment. I cannot be
sure of that. The chances are it was Equal Rights Amendment. To see
some of the Congressmen and so forth who may have lived there. Notice

the word "may because I cannot be sure. Anyway, so the Moshers invited

us to the airport. Of course they called for us. We were stopping at

the hotel. And they said "Wouldn't you like to go through the house

where Aunt Susan lived?" I can describe it as perhaps rather a simple
home. Very lovely in every way. W recollection is that it was a
rather narrow house, or appearing so. It was three stories, I think.
And we went through the different rooms in which Aunt Susan did much of
her work. And the table where she sat. And her various appertinances
and so forth.

C.M.: Has there, then, much memorabilia. lying about?

Pollitzer: Oh yes. I cannot remember just what we did see. But
it was all very, very interesting.

C.M.: Who is living there now?

Pollitzer: Oh, it is kept as one of these treasured homes for
the city. I'm not sure whether there was any adxussion charge, but I
think there probably is a small amount. But being their guests, of
course, we don't know about that being the guests of the nieces. But
I think so because nearly all these homes that are kept in memory of a.
great person have to have admission charges in order to defray expenses.

0.14.! What was meet significant about that visit? What impressed
you most about the tour of the home?

Pollitzer: That we were in the home where this great woman lived.
Where this great woman had these ideas, ideas of working for Equal Rights. .And
was brilliant. Of course you know whe was a school teacher. When she started
working for this cause, that women should vote, people would throw eggs
at her. She had to undergo all sorts of taunts and all sorts of things

that to some people would he humiliating. But she rose above everything.

I have it in my addmss book. It's very nice to keep in touch with her
and I tell her, of course, all about Anita.

C.M.: Thank you for telling me about that visit. I'd like to
know a. little bit about your background. It is of considerable interest
to people who are studying the history of women and the history of
feminism, women's right movement, to know what kind of home life these
women had. Were they inspired to this . . . . activity
by books arounl the house, by their father, by their mother? Hhat was
your home life like? Your childhood? What was your father like?

Pollitzer: Oh my dear. Papa was a gentleman, to me, above all
others. As a little child I felt papa's deep, ardent love for each one
of us. At night he would sit by us very often and. draw little pictmres.
And he would talk to us of things that we felt, even as little children,
were so interesting and so worthwhile. And when we didn't want to go to
bed. andMama would say "Time to go to bed," papa. would say "All right.
let's go up the steps together and when you come down look on the mantle
piece and. I'll have another drawing for you." Well of course, naturally, I
Mabel, would be eager to go upstairs with father, get in bed, and in the

had Mada.

C.M.: And so your father was a capable artist.

Pollitzer: An amateir artist. Father moved from the North, New York, to
5.0.
Beaufortuuwhen he was about thirteen years old. Knowing that there were

no colleges in Beaufort when father had had his early education with a
very fine teacher. I think it was a. private school then, but I cannot
be sure. Then grandpa did a wonderful thing. In grandfather's family.
father, Gustave, was the eldest. That's my father. And. then there was
Henry and Sigmund. I never knew how he got the name Sigmund, but he did.
And Richard. Then along came a little girl, Julia. So gramifather felt
it would be a very good idea to have a. college graduate, educated along
all lines if possible, to be a tutor for all of his family. Under him,

papa pursued music and went on with music. in which father was gifted.

Played the finest classical pieces with my sister Carrie.* Piano. But

 

along with that also father was educated in art. Papa drew beautifully. ‘
Nearly always, as far as I know, in pencilor crayon. Shaded. Sometimes the
drawings were maybe 15" by 8" large. Well, after tether finished the
equivalent of a college education, then he went into the cotton business.

the ginning business, with gmndfather. And I always like to emphasize

what the ginning business in cotton ms. Thinldng of Eli Whitney. Be—
cause so many people don't know what ginning is. They think of it as

gin. a whisky. Father's was in the cotton business. In Qwarleston

there was a gentleman who was also in the cotton business and knew grand-
father very, very well. After seeing father a few times, he said to
grandfather "I want your son,Gus,to be with me in the business. I love

him as if he were my son. He will be in my house just as a son would be.

I will give him every advantage and he can start in the cotton business

with me."

C.M.: Then your father went through a traditional, youthful
upbringing of education and then early Career, going into a career in
his youth. What was his attitude toward women, toward rights for women?
Gould you sense anything from your association?

Pollitzer: I cannot ever remember father discussing the injustice
of women not voting. I don't remember either mother or father ever

and active

speaking of that. But papa. was deeply interestedqin all that was good for the
city. And as a young man he always felt it was worthwhile working in various
organizations, without salary, for the good of his adopted city.

C.M.: Was he interested in the question of legal rights, poli—
tical rights, civil rights?

Pollitzer: Father was interested. in all questions that had to do
with rights of people.

C.M.: You heard discussions of this kind of question.

Pollitzer: No, dear, I can't say that I ever remember amt of those things.
You see I was just twenty—four when papa passed away in 1909. And I was
all involved in teaching. Not only teaching, but teaching a subject
whichw:S absolutely. at that time, new to the high schools in South
Carolina. Biology. No one in South Carolina had taught biology. You
see, I was deeply involved. I cannot remember that father ever worked
or thought or perhaps discussed anything about women's rights.

C.M.: If he didn't discuss women's rights, did you hear civil

libertarian talk at home, about civil rights and civil 11b9rties, the

rights of Americans. the Bill of Rights freedoms for Americans, things

of this sort. You didn't?

Pollitzer: Can't say that I ever heaid those discussions, in the early days.

C.M.: And what about your mother? Was she a traditional home-
maker?

Pollitzer: Let me say a word more, if you will, about father.
When I said papa was so interested in getting absolutely the best for
Charleston. . . they wanted father for mayor. But father's mind. was
really unusual. Clear, logical, and everybody would come. almost. to
seek papa's opinion. I remember so well how those in office would come
to this house and affectionately. . . they would often say "Polly, I've
got to ask you something about this" or "I must tell you about this?
What do you think about this?" Often called Polly by his devoted friends.
The thing was that papa often said, had he bash a lawyer, maybe people
would have passed by his shingle. But not being a lawyer, everybody
came to get advice. The ﬁftifgtfeasaﬁeegmen. And father was on, oh. so
many committees! As a lay member he was on the baud of Roper Hospital.
Not a doctor. But they sought out his advice. And he was chairman of
the first what was then called modern operating rooms in Charleston.

C.M.: He was an involved citizen. You came into an involvement
in political and civic affairs rather naturally because you had this in
your earliest home life. Deep involvement . . .

Pollitzerfisl was inspired by papa because he was active. lie was
a member of the board of health. And there's a beautiful story that I

love to tell. Of course it's a true story. When we moved into this

5 Pitt Street house in the year 1896 with a. lot 212 feet deep.
We had wonderful vegetables,chickens and a beautiful cow. And mama. said
now all the children will get all the milk and. cream ,1. - . - that
they would want. We had so much that mother would send it to the
neighbors. One day father came home from a. meeting of the board of
health and said to mother "we'11 have to give up the cow." Mama. said
"But we‘re so happy with the cow. The cow is giving us wonderful milk."
Father said "For the good of all, we'll have to give up the cow." And
mama. said "Tell me more.” Father said "I made the motion at the board
of health. There is too much typhoid in our city." Cows mean an over
abundance of flies. And so we'll give up our cow. And that reminds me
of that wonderful psalm. . . something about doing what is right even to
one's own hurt. Anirschool, when we were allowed to read psalms, I al—
ways thought of that. Because even if it hurt our own family in not get-
ting our supply of milk and being able to give it to friends, father,
for the good of all, did what he felt was right. I think it's very
beautiful. Well, father was, as I say. a. member of the Roper Hospital,
of the board of health, a. member of the fire department, for years chair-
man of finance of the board of school commissioners, and I could. keep on
art]. on.

C.M.: Tell me about your mother. Has she a. traditional home-
maker? Was she community involved?

Pollitzer: Me was a traditional homemaker who was principally
involved in the home, her precious husbami and her darling children.

Mother did take interest in some Synagogue activities and she belonged to a

guild belonging to our temple, or synagogue as I like to say. It was
so sweet, I think. Papa. would always. when he would have time, help
along with the work. Became papa did not want mama. to use the pedal,
sewing machine. He didn't want the pedaling for mother. And so the
aprons were cut out. name did all of the basting, and I can see father
at the old Singer that had the pedals and father would say "Now let me
take over now and contribute my part."

C.M.: Was your mother well?

Pollitzer: Yes. mama. was remaxhbly well. I do not know just why
papa. didn't want mama to do the pedaling except that he loved her so
much.

C.M.: She was not a club woman or active in social affairs. only
the synogogue's women's guild?

Pollitzer: Just in what now has become the sisterhood, and later in the

council of Jewish Women, 3 wonderful group.

C.M.: Did she read a great deal?

Pollitzer: Oh yes. In mama's later years, when she had time, I
have never seen such a reader, an avid reader. Book after book and al-
ways worthwhile. And the marvelous thing is once mama had read a book
she would usually start right over, that same book, and look over it
again. And. she would have it forever. She could tell you all the
stories. I remember one occasion, when I had something called para-
typhoid--it wasn't typhoid but I had to rest for many, mam weeks--
mother would read entire sets. All of Stevenson's. All of them sitting
by my bedside. Reading to me. She was really a precious love. I con-

sider that we were among the most fortunate of the fortunate in having

parents as we did have so eager for our advancement of learning.

6.14. = So you became familiar with literatmce at your mother's
knee.

Pollitzer: Definitely. And the best. And mother's English was
so superior to so many people. And mother's corrections were darling.

If I'd say "Mama. I'm going to pick out some material for a. dress" mother
would say "Mabel, not 'pick out' but 'select."' Qt whatever it was.

Mother was a. graduate of the Normal College of the City of New York in 1872.
Now called Hunter College.

C.M.: Where is that located? Where is the building?

Pollitzer: It has moved from where it was in middle downtown
New York to not so far n55w§§w10rk University where it is now. Wash-
ington Heights. But I visited the old Normal College in 1900/. I went
there and I saw the president of the colleljge,AH:h1:esrajid to me "I remember
your mother." It was wonderful.

C.M.: Where was your mother from originally?

Pollitzer: Mama, was born in Baltimore. Her father was one of
the distinguished. scholars, authors and rabbis. Rabbi Aaron Guinzburg.
In Anstria. in Prague, so much was ttwught of his ability to learn and
the outlook, the result you might say of his education. that the author-
ities made an exception. At that time not one of the Jewish faith, no
matter how learned, had ever become a Ph.D. hrt they said for Rabbi
Guinzburg we make an exception and he will be Dr. Guinzburg. He was al-
ways known as the Pail. Dr. Guinzburg. My mother was Clara. Guinzburg,‘ then

becoming Clara Guinzburg Pollitzer. And mother was born in Baltimore be-

cause when grandfather Guinzburg came to this country he first went to
Baltimore. I've never heard just how it happened that he went to Balti-
more. He introduced Reform JUdaiem into our country. Now, Rabbi Guinz-
burg was a, reformer before Isaaclitlise. Isaac M. Wise started the Hebrew
University at Cincinnati. and that is teaching reform Judaism. New
grandfather spent his time with languages, books, writing and the rebin-
ical duties. He did not start a. school. But we have a cup--oh, I remem-
ber, we gave it away to my nephew--in which it is inscribed "Given by the
Methodist Ministers of your class, who learned Hebrew under your tutelage."
And grandfather had classes in Hebrew for many of the Promstant reli—
gions. So they could really read. the original, more or less. Bible. *

C.M.: What was your mother's maternal heritage?

Pollitzer: It sounds so proud if I tell you 3.11 these things. I
only can tell you I just feel the greatness. Mother and her family be—
longed to this distinguished family of Kuh in Prague. They were a family
in which there were editors, lawyers, writers, doctors. And when Anita.
and father's sister went over together and spent quite a long time in
Austria, in Vienna and in Prague, they went to the cometary to look up
the first burial stones they could find of the family of Kuh. And. there
on the earliest tombstone, in German "came or stemmed from Spain 1498"
the time shortly after Columbus went on his trips. And at that time the
Jews were terribly persecuted. There were the Inquisitions. So this
family of Kuh moved over to Prague. Prague and Vienna. in those days
were cultural centers. So that was why they then went there. Of course
there was really no America, in 111-98. 30 that was the beginning of the

Kuh family. When Anita and my aunt went there, there were still some of
the family in existence there. Some who had not been persecuted. That
was before the time of Hitler, but anyway there was some of the family
there. They were very distinguistxed, most cultured, living under the

best conditions .

C.M.: 1Tell me about the document that you have before you.

Pollitzer: I'm holding in my hand here a. copy of what was sub-
mitted to the Federation of Women's Clubs. I should say to the Charles-
ton Federation of Women's Clubs. Here very often one is asked*to sub—
mit a biography if you have done community or religious or educational
work or all three for twenty-five years or more. Well, of course, as I
started very early, my first big activity was the Civic Club. Dated
from about 1912 or 1913, shortly after I finished college in 1906. Be-
cause then the Charleston Civic Club, I felt. was most community minded
and doing wonderful work. And it was shortly after I joined that they
said to me "It seems like you would be a fitting chairman of the City
Betterment Committee." I said I would be happy to serve if I could do
it well. I never missed a meeting. I never Imew how I did. all these
things.

C.M. : This led you to involvement in all of these organizations,
or in work with or cooperation with them. There's a great long list
there. It's impressive.

Pollitzer: These are the various things that I did. These are
the various things in which I felt I really was a. pioneer. I said
* by one or more of the Federated Clubs. (I was asked, and so was my sister

Carrie by the Council of Jewish Women, and was asked also by Hadassah.)

pioneer in classroom and school, and community activities.

C.M.: There's a. list of about twenty-five organizations here,
all haying to do. . . .

Pollitzer: They aren't organizations. All activities in which I
pioneered. I pioneered in classroom—- in school clubs.

[End of side of tape. Proceed to second side.]

I'm using the word pioneered. because I know of nobody who did many of
these things before these ideas came into my mind. And. once they came
into my mind, I just had to satisfy mself and work towards some goal.

C.M.: So as a matter of fact you may have been involved with
many more groups than appear?

Pollitzer: Oh yes. These are the things that are outstanding.
IfIwere toreadabookIwouldsaythisandthisarﬂthis. Anyway,
the point is, I did pioneer in classroom and school activities, city
activities, county activities, state activities,and national activities.
My national activities involved at one time when I felt there should not
be capital punishment. Now I'm on the fence. I don't know. National
activities certainly were the National Women's Party with suffrage. And
after suffrage I worked like a. beaver without stopping to get the equal
rights amendment passed. I would say educational activities were of
course my primary, primary interest. Naturally, being a. teacher. * And I
did a. great deal of press work and had many things published. I wrote a
great many publications. I wrote plays for the school, plays for the
health board.

C.M.: I hope they've got them on file.

and was President of the Charleston County Teachers Association.

Pollitzer: I do not know. But anyway. one was concerning anti-
mosquito work and so on. Another-—they dramatized this. really I attend-
ed to it--wa.s on first aid, given before our whole school body. And it
went over beautifully. It was Dr. First Aid and so forth. I was chair—
man of the city Betterment Committee, as I said, of the Civic Club of
Qaerleston. And I was the founder of plant exchange day in March, 1915.
At that time I had never heard. of any plant exchange in the South. But
I saw a wheelbarrow of violet plants, roots just as fresh with the earth
on it. And this wheelbarrow of plants was about to be dumped just one
block away from us. When I saw the wastage, I thought "My, the people
who would love to get violets." Because violet plants then were gradu-
ally disappearing. Hell, I spoke of it at the Civic Club. I went to a
physician, not mine, but one who thought the world and all of father and
had worked with father in Roper Hospital and health boards and so on. I
asked him, as he was also a botanist, "you know, I'd like to send out
return postal cards to many who have lovely gardens where the surplus,
instead of being wasted, could enter the gardens of somebody desiring
these plants." And he said "A wonderful idea." We had circulars and
everything. Tremendous advertisement through the Civic Club. I
had one humired on my committee. Because we had to have committees on
collection, after we knew who woold cooperate. He had to have committees
on distribution. I received help, of course. from the mayor, so we
would have policemen so it wouldn't be a grab festival. And we started
the first plant exchange at Memminger school, where I was teaching.

Then I decided, to have gzeat interest, we would give a prize to the one

who could take the best photographs of the plants being unloaded at
Memminger. And it was very interesting, a. fifteen year old youngster
got the prize for the best picture that was taken.

And some years afterwards, he became the director of our
art gallery. He loved photography and art at that age. Robert N. White—
low. Anyway. the point 15,1 worked very hard on plant exchange. And
there was a very fine woman who was just as interested, I would say. as
I was after I proposed the idea. Mrs. William Ianneau. After about
four years. on one occasion——that was the time I think I had that para—
typhoid or whatever it was--she took over. I realized I could not go
on with this and with school and with everything else. So after about
the fourth year, Mrs. Ianneau was chairman of it all. Did wonderful

1:
work for a long period of time. I liked the idea of having it in the

schools in the afternoon, so that we could indoctrinate the school children

 

with the idea of sharing. But later on, it became an activity taken over by the
garden club. 'Ihe Civic Club disbanded, by the way, some years ago.
C.M.: Was the Civic Club women?
Pollitzer: Only women. I was there at the meeting where we had
to vote whether to disband and give all of our records to the South

But I like the idea. as I said, of having the school children see the
tables set up and the plants labeled and everything so they could have
a part in it.

C.M.: Speaking of garden clubs, how did the local gaiden clubs
greet your Woman's Party activities in Charleston? Did they not cooper—
ate at all? Were they disinterested totally?

Pollitzer: I wouldn't use the word disinterested. I don't like
to use the word ignored because I don't know that they were ignorant of
it, but I've never heard of them wanting to do anything. This seems a.
rather strange thing perhaps. I was the first to have gardens in Gaar-
leston and garden clubs. Through our school activities, I felt we had
the space to have a. garden. Here these girls entering high school had
never, never seen probably a radish growing or any of the plants. So I
divided this large space into 150 little 3x6 plots. Then those plots
were divided in half so that each one would have a. little square. The
reason there was 150 was because 150 new pupils came to high school
every year. Thirty in a class, five sections. It was all the lowest

class, but divided into five sections.
The girls loved gardening time. Usually we started it maybe early in
the morning. And a girl would say, for instance, "my bean has been cut
down." I'd say "let's see what was the hungry insect." And we'd dig
and we'd find a cut worm. How could we be smarter than the cut worm?
He would make a little collar of cardboald and put it around the stem of
the bean. And in that way they learned the relation of plants and ani-
mals. It was really a. great experience.

won't be sure of that date, but it was somewhere around 1945.

C.M.: Here you already teaching when you became active in the
suffrage movement?

Pollitzer: I graduated from Columbia University in 1906. Before
I graduated I had this precious letter from my principal, whom I adored.
I vemmted. I venerate his memory. Maybe I told you that I was still
a senior in high school-—or then it was high and normal. So I was a
senior really in the second year of the normal school when he said to
me "Miss Mabel, no biology is taught in South Carolina. when you gradu-
ate I want you to come back here and I want you to he on my faculty."
His name was William Knox Tate, one of the grandest men that ever lived.
Six feet four. Beautifully proportioned. And as he stood in front of
me, maybe about two months before I graduated, his first question was
"Miss l'hbel, axe you sure you're going to college?" I said "Definitely."
“Where?" ”Columbia University. I‘m going to register at Teachers Col—
lege." He said "Then I appoint you right now to be on our faculty."
I said "Mr. Tate, that is a. wonderful thing. I know you mean it and
I'm happy to accept." Then he said "Now you will have very big offers
before you graduate from columbia. Don‘t feel because I've asked you
that you will be impelled to return to hemminger. But I want you." I
did have very big offers. The first position for which I was asked was
to teach laboratory work at the University of Pennsylvania. It wasn't a
temptation for me. No. I knew Mr. Tate. I really revered him. He was
so wonderful. I cannot tell you just all in all what he was to me. But

such an ideal teacher. SO understanding. Well, I turned to Dr. Henry Crampton,

a professor who asked me. . . . I was also going to Barnard College. .
and he said "Miss Mabel, you don't mean you are refusing this position
where they will need you at the University of Pennsylvania?" I said "I
thank you, Dr. Crampton, I prefer to teach at Memminger High and Normal
School." He said. "And. where is that?" I told him in Charleston, South
Carolina. “I've never heard of it." I said "But you will hear of it.
We have a great teacher, Professor Tate, who invited me to teach when I
was still a senior. I want that position." He said "And you're sure of
it?" "Definitely." I had other positions offered to me. Everything
was turned down for the sake of Memminger. And in the final letter that
Mr. Tate wrote to me, he said "Remember, we're going to give you the
top salary in Charleston. As a beginner, it can not be anymore than
$500 a year. If he had said five cents a year, I would have said all
right. It was to be associated with him. It was so wonderful. I know
he thought much of me, I know that. But it was just so wonderful to
have his guidance. So of course, when you asked about my beginning my
work as a teacher, it was in the autumn of 1906. The first class that
graduated. . . to that class I would say I had taught nature study. Be—
cause these girls would grow up and not know a thing. They didn't know
an oak from an elm. They didn't know anything about birds. They didn't
know anything about the germination of seeds or plants. And being a
normal school at that time, many of them were going to be teachers.
Some of the girls were older than I.

C.M.: You taught a combination of botany and biology and. . .

Pollitzer: Botany was in the lowest class. Zoology was in the

third year. Zoology and. physiology.

C.M.: And you taught them all?

Pollitzer: My classes were very large. The first year we had no
laboratory. Mr. Taggiwrsgbreﬁill’naelto plan my laboratory. He was so wonder—
fully understanding. He realized that the greater responsibility 3.
person had, if he had any brains at all, he would rise to the occasion
and act in a worthwhile way. So he said "Miss Mabel, for the first
year you are teaching, it will be in a small classroom." Well, we had
long tables and many chairs. The teaching was under the most adverse con-
ditions. But I was there to inspire the girls to want more. He had al—
ways said a. teacher's work could end if the girls were so interested
that they would get for themselves more and more. Then you can not. stop
them. And I felt that was my mission. To get them to Say they wanted
more and more.

C.M.: I wonder if you became interested in the position of women
as a. result of being mentor to so many young women. If you became eager
for the cause of their betterment.

Pollitzer: At that time. . you see, this was 1906 as I say, I
started teaching at high school and normal school. I don't believe I
ever gave it a thmght really. My thought was on my girls.

C.M.: But don't you think your experiences with them were plant-
ing little seeds that would later germinate?

Pollitzer: I can't say, really. I was terribly involved in many
things. I had wonderful notebooks. 'Ihe drawing was perfectly marvelous
that these girls did. Their sketches, their desire to excell. And later

on I became president of our Memminger teachers' association. Later on I
was president of the county teachers association. I wrote more than the
equivalent of a chapter in a manual published by the State Department Of
Education. It was a syllabus for the teaching of the various subjects

in South Carolina high schools. I was so deeply involved in everything, I
really at that time don't believe I ever thought of Women's Rights.

C.M.: What I'm trying to do is to discover what triggered your
interest and dedication to the cause of women's rights.

Pollitzer: Dear, I think it was Alice Paul. When she founded the
National Women's Party on January 2, 1913, and later my sister Anita's involvement.

C.M.: But how did you know she was even doing it?

Pollitzer: Susan Pringle Frost was such a wonderful woman in Charleston,
South Carolina.who was chairman first of the Equal Suffrage League and then The
Congressional Union, then split later on.* As I said, some didn't want picketing
and some wanted to belong to the National American Woman Suffrage Association.
Carrie and I and Anita felt definitely we wanted to belong to the group that
had split from the National American Women's organization, this group led by
Alice Paul. Marvelous woman} No one can conceive of the greatness of
Alice Paul. Not only her training. Her marvelous Quaker background. Her
cause for what was right. Her inspiration as a leader. Her wisdom and intelli—
gence. And just add to that every good quality and wonderful thing you can
think of. We felt that getting it state by state, as presented by Susan
Pringle Frost through Alice Paul, would be a great mistake. It would delay
it for years. And as I said before, one legislature could undo the good
work of a preceding group of legislators.

C.M.: Tell me about your relations with Senator Pollock, who was

your advocate in a way.

Pollitzer: I did not know him personally. Anita did wonderful
work with him, of which I will tell you in a little while. But I was
chairman of the press. I won't call it committee because there was no-
body else. But for years Miss Frost did a great deal in press work as
Chairman of the South Carolina branch of the National Women's Party.
For years she did the press work. When I thought she began to be a.
little bit elderly—~now I think she was still young.

C.M.: How old was that?

Pollitzer: I cannot tell you. And I was wanting to phone to St.
Michael's, where she worshipped every Sunday. I wanted to find out what
is the date on her gravestone or in their records when she died. I'm
not sure. Maybe I can still do that. I cannot tell you when she died.
But I did a tremendous lot for her. So that I was really the acting
chairman. For years and years. I would go to see her. She would in-
part information to me. And there was another very wonderful worker, of
the Business and Professional women's club, Mrs. Ruth McInnes. She
lives in Charleston for years as the wife of Dr. McInnes. later in
life she moved to Greenville. As long as she was in Charleston. when
telegrams were needed, I would say "Ruth"—-her maiden name was Ruth
Wilson-—"p1ease get off a dozen telegrams through the Business and Pro-
fessional Women's Clubs." She did“ But Anita had spoken before the
Business and Professional Women's Club. And there was Marion Paul and
Ann Mott, and as I say, Ruth McInnes . I can name many

more who, having heard Anita, were inspired. And they continued to help

me in sending off telegrams or writing letters when needed. And when
you say about Sen. Pollock:k you see, that is a story which ought to
Rally be 'by itself. Anita with Sen. Pollock. And I will give that a
little later. Now when you were asking about some of my activities. As
I said, of course my educational activities were big things. my press
work and publication. And I've spoken of the school garden clubs. Now
before there was ever a garden club in Charleston. I had home garden
clubs in which the girls changed an ugly, littered backyard into a. love—
ly either vegetable or flower garden or both. This is a. very interest-
ing thing. Many of those girls who were members of that gardening club,
the home garden club I'm speaking of. became florists. I think that's
interesting. Now the way in which I could visit those home gardens — we talked
about it in school. Because as I say, our gardens in school were small.
But it inspired them to want more. So then I asked how many would want
to become members of a. home garden club. Keep in mind, this was before
we ever had a. garden club in Charleston. Knowing those members, their
addresses, we had photographs taken of the ugly littered gardens or
yards. Then, at the proper season, when everything was very beautiful,
we had photographs taken of the change, the evolution that had taken
place in the backyards. A prize was given by the Civic Club. I had
told the Civic Club of it, coming under my group certainly: . City Better—
ment. The thing was. how to get around to visit these gardens. There
was a wondegjf‘uilalnaéﬁegh‘s. Julius M. Visanska. Marvelous club woman.
Wonderful in every way. She had a. chauffeur. And I said "Mrs. Visanska.

I want to borrow your chauffeur and your car if I may for certain after-

noons. Then I could have the pictures taken of these gardens and I could
pay visits later to help the girls and then also when the photographs would be
taken when the gardens had flowers and vegetables." She said "Certainly, you
can have my chauffeur and my car." The car. as I remember it, didn't

have any top. I remember we wound up on a. bumpy street. I nearly bump-

ed out of the car. I wondered if I would come back in the roadway or

where. But no matter where those gardens were——some ware rather far

away-—I visited them. And I felt that that had a. great deal to do, we

might say, in bettering the lives of these girls. It taught cleanliness.

And it also taught keeping old rubber tires out of their yard. Rubber

tires that would breed mosquitos. That was another thing I organized

for my girls, with my girls. An anti mosquito league. At that time in
Charleston nearly everybody had a. big cistern. I explained to them juet
what was needed and the rules to become a member of the league. It was

to keep down mosquitos. What to do and how to do it and so forth. And

the dues for membership, because I felt it is always worthwhile, no

matter just how few pennies we had, the dues for membership were three
pennies. With those three pennies I sent off to a firm and we had anti
mosquito buttons. The girls wore the anti mosquito buttons. Very proud
that they were helping to rid marleston of mosquitos. In those days,

you must remember, there was no spraying. People didn't know the life.hist:ry of

Pollitzer: And probably a little board that you could move from
time to time. He too have a cistern because this house was built in

about 1835. And I remember father‘s care in always washing off the roof

before any rain would ever get into the cistern. He also had a. force
pump in the back yard that would force water up into the tank on top of
the roof. I don't want to neglect what people should know.
C.M.: Of course whoever is researching the Pollitzer sisters in
Wieston and their contributions will have access to documents, too.
Pollitzer: Well, what I'm telling you is pretty much what I told
to the group from the Charleston Federation of Women's Clubs. I would like to
speak of this with my school girls, because I thought doing things with

school girls, to reach into the homes, was an enlarging factor, we might

say, of their lives. In the early days women vendérs would come to the

house with a big bundle of whatever it might be. Dogwood, or beautiful

flowers, or broken—off sprays of Holly or Jessamine. Whatever they could get. So
we started first Save the Holly club. It was a club to save the Holly.

And the girls belonging to that club would tell their mothers not to buy

the Holly when it was sold at the front doors because it meant that a

Holly tree--which is very slow growingnhad been mutilated. Damagelthe

growth. Insects.wou1d get into the broken tissue of the plant. Hell,

 

from the save the holly club, we went to Save time Wildflower Club. And
that led to legislative ruling that no wild flowers could be picked
within fifty feet of the roadside. '
C.M.: Miss Pollitzer, I see that you were an activist in so'many
areas beside women's rights.
Pollitzer: The reason I was active in the different areas is be-
cause the lives of these girls covered so many areas.

" C.M.: The whole thing is the living of your philosophy.

Pollitzer: Well. that's very sweet to say so. But that is just
what I felt. Now later on I worked for legislative action, first in
our city. I'm just wondering if I'm forgetting any particular school
activity, but I will glance over anything later on, becaUSe I did make a
few notes. But this was very dear to my heart. We just had to have a.
ban on the sale and discharge of fireworks. Now we all know the danger
and damage done. In one‘ of our schools in the city, a little girl was
told that her little firecracker was out. And she wanted to see if she
had to use a Punk and light it again. She leaned over it. Well,
the firecracker wasn't out. It exploded. She lost her eye. He knew of
the danger. Another child thought it would be fun if they put the fire-
cracker in the mouth and light it. And another one in the
ear. And they did stupid things. At one of our private schools some
boys, not students, thought it would be fun to throw a lighted pack of firecrackers
into a soft coal bin. And here, among this bituminous coal——this was at Ash—
ley Hall-—in this bin containing I don't know what quantity of bitumi—
nous coal, the fire crachersset it on fine. I saw boys not far from
here light a pack of firecrackers, throw it into a letter box, and then
hide behind 2:23:11”. So that when the children would see somebody
coming, they would run. They wanted to find out the dismay when these
firecrackers went off. The lady thought she was going to have a letter.
But instead of that. there was an explosion. I thought that must not
be. I went to Mr. Rogers, who was at that time the principal of Hemming-
er. George C. Rogers, the father of the history professor. And I said
"Mr. Rogers, you were principal where that little girl in your school was

blinded. Come with me. We're going to talk at city council. You will

he a witness to the fact that the little girl lost her eye." I said to
get this thing going what I'm first going to do is to have it sponsored,
not by one individual but 'by our Memminger teachers' association parent-
teachers association. So it was at the parent—teachers association, I
saidf‘I want the president to be a member of this committee.“ And she,
with Mr. Rogers and myself, would speak at city council. We did. One of
the men said "Oh. don't take away the fun of the children." I said "Fun
for the moment. Blindness forever." Our very house, right here, was
set on fire by a firecracker. This particular day was Qiristmas, December
1926. I was busy wrapping up the last of my homemade candy for Wist-
mas gifts for friends and. acquaintances. And a dear lady upstairs, Mrs.
Holmes. said "Miss Mabel, the house is on fire." The little cottage in
the rear was already blazing. And she said "Gone up stairs." I said
"No, I'm packing." And the interesting part, what I put into a suitcase.
Father's drawings, medals that the family had received, and precious
little heirlooms, photographs. Never thought of putting clothes in.
But all that took just a minute or two. Of course I phoned the fire
alarm immediately. And there wasn't an engine to come here. Every en-
gine had gone to the Heatherhon‘eAFIﬁjnﬁgr Mill just about two or two and a
half blocks from where we lived. Somebody in passing thought it would be
fun to throw a firecracker" on the saw dust.

works and the ban on the sale and discharge, I spoke at city council,

having the principal, George Rogers, there and also the president of the
parent teachers. Because of that law, the state——working on that law

which was passed pertaining to our city——soon took it up. That was the

first law that I know of that put a ban on the sale in cities of over

40,000. Just two or three years ago it was, I worked very hard again,

and I sent up a delegation from the federation of women's clubs, to be
present there to work and to speak and to show the folly of allowing

fire works in even a little two by four town. A child that is blinded

in the tiniest city loses the eye just as well as in the big city. I

worked with Rep. Dangerfield—-his name, I thought, was so appropriate——

and with the chief one who sponsored it, a fireman, Fireman Mishoe.

One of my biggest works was obtaining our county library, opened in the

year 1930. That is called the Charleston County Library. You see,
Charleston was a very literate city. And the museum and the College of
Charleston and the library society (a membership library) were all organized
about the same time, in the early 17705. And there was a small library here in
the early years. Whatever happened to it, I don't know. That small library,
I understand was free. Its lifespan was short. We grew up having only the
library society as our source for more books. Father was a great bibliophile.
The number of books that papa would purchase! He felt it was the best
investment for education that anybody could have. As a result, we do have
sets of very valuable books. I wish father could have bought sets of

time for me, because my days never had

1&8 hours. But anyway, the point is I felt the need of awlibrary. The

Rosenwald Foundation had offered to Miss Iaura Bragg, then director of
the marleston museum, a sizeable fund. And Mrs. Glelia. McGowan was
deeply interested. The proposition was that if our legislators ’
would pass a bill, then this Rosenwald Foundation would, for every
$10,000 we would put up, put up twice as much. For the first two years.
For instance, if our legislators would make, now what seems a. relatively
small appropriation of $10,000, they would put up $20,000. Well. for
the first two years, you see that would have meant $60, 000. For the
third and fourth year, they would match it. Our legislators would put
up $15,000 and they would put up $15,000. For the fifth year, they
would put up a large fractional part. And do you know, our legislators
turned it down. I was in New York at that time, sorry I couldn't plunge
in. But upon my return every night I would go to bed thinking, the
another session.

say that. I'm going to tell you something. I know that Sunday is a
holy day with you." Her uncle somebody was a bishop. "I know that.
Will you give up Friday afternoon, all of Satlmiay, all of Sunday and
we'll get that library bill passed." She said "You just don't under-
stand." "Will you give up that time?" "Yes." "I will go in your car.
We will see the leading citizens and the legislative delegation of
Charleston and we'll accomplish the library." She said "Well, if you
think so." Now she was a. person of indomitable will. She felt it
couldn‘t be done. I felt it could be done. We went to the leading
citizens. I first went to one whose opinion I valued very highly and I
said "Among the legislators, whonshould we see first? Make a. list of
the legislatoarrsiwﬂix you feel we should see first of all. Make a. 11st
of the leading citizens whomwe want to bring pregame to bear on this

library educated. And he was all for it. Only sorry that the legislators had
said they would not increase the budget- They wege elected that year

Next to nothing. All right. He told us who-to see. One of the men was
Mr. Haselden, who was a. trustee of our schools. Miss McBee said "No
use to see Mr. Haselden. He won't see a person." I said "He'll see me."
I phoned to him. I Said "Mr. Haselden, you may know me as one of your
teachers. I am coming to see you. I know you won't see anybody. I
will stand on your: doorsill. And standing on your doorsill, in a minute
or two I can tell you the advantage to Charleston county to work for

getting that library bill passed.“ He said "Come." I knew he'd see me.

much money would come into Charleston county. The Rosenwald Founlation

the third reading, all successful, the item was not in the budget. One
of the mysteries. I saw him insert it. And these mysteries, how they
happened, I don't know. But it was omitted. The third reading had taken
place successfully. And then we thought, now what. They had to do the
whole works over again. In the meantime, the Angina. sore throat legis—
lator got well. Before he left, I phoned to him. I said "I know how
firm you are. You are adamant against appropriating one penny for the
county library. I know you all went in on no increase in the millage.
Ext this will bring in so much money." He said "Miss Pollitzer, I will
promise you one thing. I may not vote for it, but I will not work
against it." I said "That's right." He sent me a telegran--wha.t a.
beautiful thing to do. (I've turned all these things over to Miss Sand-
ers, the head. librarian.) He sent me a. telegram to the effect of "Con-
gratulations, the library bill passed. You won." Something like that.

called it my library.

[Interruptiom]
At first we were housed in the Charleston museum. Miss Iaura. M. Bragg,

who was director then of the museum, also was librarian. We were crowd-

ed. In five years we moved to the beautiful Michael Jenkins house at the NE corner
Montague and Rutledge. And we were rather crowded but we functioned
marvelously. In 1960 a new library had been built. It was amazing.
People look at it and they think it might have cost $1 million and more
dollars. It only cost about three quarters of a. million. Very fine
structure. You know where and what it is. I remained trustee until
relatively a few years ago. Then, of course, I was elected honorary
trustee. Because I was really trustee before there was a library. I
wrote the story of the getting of the county library. This is in the
library. That tells more than what I have just told you.
G.M. : Your working to secure the vote in favor of the free li-
brary gave you valuable practice. I would imagine, in stumping for pass-
age of the equal rights amendment.
Pollitzer: Dear, I can't say there was anything connected with
it at all. You see, it is Anita who has spent her entire life, we might
say. working for, in later years, the equal rights amendment. Until,
of course. she became not well enough to continue. mt I have had, as
you know, many interests. I cannot say they were directed directly to
women in any way. I wanted the library for women, men and children.
C.M.: I understand, but I'm saying the political experience you
gained in working to get this measIn'e passed you could certainly have put
to use in the interest of getting suffrage passed.

Pollitzer: The Susan B. Anthony Amendment was passed in 1920. I worked for

that. The passage of the Library Bill came ten years later. Working for

Pollitzer: I feel if you are built in a certain way and if a.
thing is right, you don't stop just because you see a stone in the
pathway. If a thing is right, keep on. Don't let any little difficulty
be an insurmountable object. Now the reason I was told it couldn't be Passed
was because it hadn't been passed. the previous year and they had gone in
on voting for no increase in millage. That‘s why we were so involved in
getting the vote. But after all, you've got to have a logical mind.
And if more money comes in to the county than what goes out of the county,
why then that is good. Well, that's pretty much the story of the County
Library.
You've asked me to tell you of the events
which led to the obtaining of the library and tell of the early years.
C.M.: So you have documents really substantiating all of your
civic work. In this civic work, you came into contact with a number of
leading South Carolina. politicians and Charleston political figures.
Pollitzer: Some. I wouldn't say so many. When I felt the time
was needed, then I would go to the very highest of whomever was needed.
But i tween times, I mean I just did the regular things in school, many cultural
ffairs , activities ,
householdmr whatever it might be. I'd like to say how we got this
building at the corner of Rutledge and antague. The number is 94 Rut-
ledge — the first library building. It was a. mautiful mansion. When
the time came that we had to move, I thought right away of this beauti-
ful msidence. It had been my father's first home. Because you' 11 re—

member the gentleman who knew grandfather wanted father to live with

 

him. I knew of the large grounds. It was then owned by Mr. Henry Ficken, who

at that time was preSident of are of the banks. I went to Mr. Ficken
and I said "Your house at 91+ Rutledge has been on the market for sale
for many years. It is not occupied. I want you to do something in
memory of your very respected, very fine father, who was mayor of
Charleston during certain years." He said. "What do you want me to do?"
"I want you to give that home, 9% Rutledge, as a. library, to the library
to the delegation of whomever you would give a home for the library."
And. he said "It would be a. nice thing to do, wouldn't it?" I said "Yes,

your father would be honored. I know you could do it." He said "You

know, I want to sell that house for $75,000." Which was a fortune in

those days, because this was before 1934. I said "But you haven't sold
it." "Well, I' 11 think about it." The next year, before the taxes were
due, I went to see Mr. F‘icken again. "Mr. Ficken, you know, you've had
a. year to think about it. I'm hoping that you will, in memory of your
father, give that building. We will call it the Ficken library." "I'm
not so sure about it." Well, I felt like saying "Well. what are you
going to do?" He said "I'm going to give a very fine, framed etching.

I want to give that to the library." I said "Many a library can have
art works. We want the building." "I' 11 think about it." It was on

 

a. busy school day and I got a telegram. Mr. Picken was going to put

that house at auction. I got a. telegram from the Rev.-—the name will

first president of our library board. It was in about 1935. We were
in the museum for five years, from 1930 to 1935. And then we were in

this building, 94 Rutledge, from 1935 to 1960.

C.M.: I thought that you were working for the free public
library in about 1915.

Pollitzer: Plant exchange in 1915. So this telegram came from
this fine minister of the St. Andrews Iutheran (hutch. His name is
Dr. Charles B. Foelsch. lovely gentleman. Just lovely in every way.
He was the first piesident of our library board. He was one who also
helped. He went up to Columbia and helped with the delegation urging
them--although as I say, they really, by that time, didn't need urging"
but to see that they held true to their word that they would vote for it.
We had quite a. delegation going 111) to Columbia. I did not go.
I stayed here and. worked getting telegrams to bring pressure. But Dr.
Foelsch was great. And he is living. An elderly gentleman now, with a.
church in New York. I hear of him from time to time. He wrote me a.
beautiful letter. I've turned that over, also, to the library. Now
the point was, here I was and I wanted that building. And Its. Ficken
would not give it. But as I said, this telegram came from Dr. Foelsch,
then spending a. little time in Florida. He said "Miss Mabel, please go
to the auction and bid in for 9‘!- Rutledge. He must have that building."
I had never been to an auction in my life. And. I thought, how would I
go about such a thing. Moreover, I was in school and I would never de-
sert my duties and pleasures. I phoned to Mr. Homer Pace, grand gentle—
man. Oh. we had wonderml gentlemen on our board. He was the first
vice president. I phoned to him and. I said. "leave everything, Mr. Pace,
if you can. Be present at the auction. Try not to exceed $10,000."

That was what we had said we would spend if necessary. Mr. F‘icken, the

owner of the house, had told me he wouldn't take less than $18,000

and that was a gift of $57,000 because he wanted $75,000. He said
he was giving it away. Mr. Pace represented Dr. Foelsch and me at the
auction. The house wasn't sold. In a. short time, Mr. Ficken wrote

to Dr. Foelsch "You can have the house for $10,000." And the paving
costs of $1,000. Dr. Fbelsch said accepted. But we never called it
the Fichen library. He gave a. picture, instead. The point is, we got
it. We were there, as I say. from 1935 to 1960 when we moved into this
new building. We planned. beautifully. Of course we leaked at every de—
tail. We really wanted to have it, of course. one story, but it could
not ‘09. So it is a two story building. But capable of enlargement if
need be. Wonderzml children's room. I said name it after our fine
friend, Joinietit was really very great that we could have this child-
ren's room.

C.M. : I can see from your activities in the community that you
are a civic minded person who is interested in bettering her environment
and I‘m sure that your interest in women's rights fits into this general
category of activity, too.

Pollitzer: Definitely. I feel I am what I am because, not only
of my forbears, . who were very civic minded. . . . Grarxifather in
Beaufort did wonderful things. My grandfather Guinzburg died before I
was born and I do not know a great deal of him except as I said. writer, scholar
an). author and rabbi. And the wonderful part, he was a pioneer in
having less conservative Judaism and having reform Judaism.

That was grandfather and he really was a. pioneer in that long before

there was Isaac M. Wise. They corresponded later on. But anyway, I
feel I am as I am yretty much because of father, who pointed the way to
doing everything that was good for the community. Father had the big-
gest offers to locate in other large cities.

C.M.: But as far as active women were concerned, you really had
no role model did you? Your role model was your father. You had no
woman active in the community active--

[End of side of tape. Proceed to side 2.]

C.M.: Tell about your trusteeships in the city of Charleston.

Pollitzer: Hell, it was before 1930. The museum had a campaign
for membership. I was asked to serve, which of course I gladly did. Be—
cause our museum being the very oldest museum in the country is well
known, even abroad. I did get so many memberships thatitthe next meeting
one of the gentlemen proposed that I should be a member of the board of
trustees, which I gladly accepted if I could help in any way. It was the
following year that they then appointed me secretary to the board of
trustees. I served not only as trustee but as secretary to the board of
trustees until about 1964- I think it was the longest secretary-
ship in the history of the museum. And I'm happy to say that except for
illness on one occasion--it wasn't I who was 111, but a member of the
family--I didn't miss a meeting. As such, it gave me an opportunity to
write letters of thanks and appreciation to the many worthwhile men and
women who gave gifts to the museum. Archer M. Huntington and his wife.
Mr. Huntington gave Brookgreen Gardens to the state. I remember the

beautiful letter I had from him. All of these things, of course, I've

turned over to the museum. And it was great. It really was very great.
I worked to get the planetarium; it was a wonderful thing for the
South to have such a planetarium as we have in the museum. I worked on
all occasions. Well, the point was that was one of the trustees. A meeting
of the trustees of our congregation? Beth Elohim,followed very soon. And
I was appointed a woman trustee.

C.M.: Was this an unusual appointment?

Pollitzer: Yes. That was in the very early days. I do not know
whether I was the first woman. But I was among the first. I may have
been the first. I don't know. And I was trustee, for five years, of our
congregation.

C.M.: Have Carrie and Anita been active in synagogue work?

Pollitzer: Yes. Carrie was a teacher in one of the classes for
many years. A very fine teacher, having had kindergarten and so forth
as a background. And loved teaching. Anita did excellent work, too, in
our Sunday school, Sabbath school. Anita, right after college, became
head instructor of art at the University of Virginia. And then the fol—
lowing year. . . in fact before the following year, she joined the na—
tional woman's party. And they recognized that she was outstanding in
every way. She has hardly been in Charleston since 19léz’except for 6 months and
visits. But Anita had a wonderful Sunday school class that she taught. She was
then in High and Normal School. Many of our leading citizens here look upon
it with joy and appreciation if they had Anita as a Sunday school teacher.
She did all of her teaching in a very original way. Again, to inspire, we
might say, not only the pupils but to get them to have enough interest that
they would want

to know more. And that's the thing. Now. my other trusteeship. . . .
I've mentioned the library, the museum, and the congregation. Those
were the three trusteeships. Of course I've held offices in different
clubs. But I never wanted myself to be overburdened with being presi-
dent of this and that.

C.M. : But you have certainly been active in many, many different
kinds of organizations.

Pollitzer: Many fields. They wanted me, of course, to be presi—
dent of the Civic Club of Charleston. That, at that time, was such an
enormous undertaking because it had so many different branches. You
see, the Civic Club, in the earliest days, wanted a librazy. And that
was why, when Miss MCBee was president of the Civic Club, they really
wanted a library. I don't want to disparage anything that very warner-
ful Dr. McBee did. But she just felt because the legislators said it
couldn't be done that it couldn't be done. But I felt I wanted to point
the way.

C.M. : Did you hold office in the women's party before the 19th
Amendment was passed?

Pollitzer: I never held office before the suffrage amendment was
passed, no. I guess I could say I g hold office because I was press
chairman for mine. I mte to Sen. Pollock.

C.M.: As press chairman did you write to Sen. Tillmn?

Pollitzer: I do not remember I ever wrote to him.

mm. 2 Did you have letters from both of them?

Pollitzer: I know I had letters from Sen. P0110 ck.

Pollitzer: I have toiguth: highlights of these things. And of
course telling this story to ﬁreally very interesting. The getting of
the library. Extremely interesting throughout the years. The tremen-
dous expansion. Instead now of working for five years on the sum of
$30,000 for each of the five years. That was all it was. $30,000 for
each of the five years. The number is now perfectly tremendous. On the
payroll. Numbers of branches, numbers of workers at each branch, another
book mobile we're getting now. I just got a. letter. I get all the in—
formation, of course, as honorary trustee. And I did attend a meeting
not long ago. Miss Emily Sanderswrote me the most beautiful letter of
appreciation and that the board members were happy to have me present
and so forth. The Cooper River library. The Cooper River Memorial.
That is now having an addition. It's one thing after another. The West
Ashley had a. large addition to the library. And the growth of it.
startng from humble beginnings in the small place that was given to us
by the Charleston museum. And the funny part, the museum trustees want-
ed us to get out. And here I was, trustee of the library and trustee and secretary
the museum. I would explain to them, we wanted to get out too, but we
have to have a building. That was why then I worked so hard to get the
94 Rutledge house, which Mr. Ficken was unseccessful in selling until he
finally turned it over to us. Oh, this is rather interesting. Before
I thought that we would purchase it, I went to the office of Mr.
Albert Simons. A truly great architect. Lover of muleston. One of
the writers of the octagon library of architecture. It's like saying

the Bible of architecture. I said "Mr. Simone, come with me. We do

not want to make a mistake. Because this building is valuable, ya don't

want to have the weight of maybe tons of books collapse if the beams
are not strong, if it would not be suitable." So he and I and Dr. Foelsch
went through and we didn't tell our secret to anybody. because we didn‘t
want anybody to outbid us if it had to be bought, by auction or other—
wise. We didn't want anybody to know that the library board of trustees
was thinking of buying that building. The price might have been raised
up and up and up. Albert Simons said instead of just the wooden beams
we would also have steel supports between the stories. And he said it
would be perfectly safe to use that beautiful building. And there were
really not so many changes. Just mostly in the first room as you enter,
The great thing was when we opened at the (harleston museumI and then 1

we opened again at 94 Rutledge. And it was even a greater day when we opened
at King and. Calhoun.

C.M.: I thank you for your recollections.

Pollitzer: My recollections also include that I was present at
each one of the ogenings of the branch libraries. And. I remtmber so
well getting a. photograph. It was at Mt. Pleasant. Nobody thought of
having a photographer there. One of our trustees lived on Mt. Pleasant.
I said to him "May I use your phone. I have an idea." So I phoned to
Mr. Howard Jacobs, photographer in Charleston. "Mr. Jacobs, please
leave everything. Get over to Mt. Pleasant." I told him where we would
meet him to take him to the library. I wanted him there to record by
photograph the exercises of the dedication of the Mt. Pleasant library.
And he got there in time. It was wonderful and I was so happy. Because
somebody said. if you have an idea. don't let it die,if it's a good. idea.
