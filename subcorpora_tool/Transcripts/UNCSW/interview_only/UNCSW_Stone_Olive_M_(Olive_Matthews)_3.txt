S. Gluck: &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; decision, after Montevallo, to leave and to go to  Huntingdon; of how you received the offer and what were some of the elements  in your decision to take the position at Huntingdon . This would have been  your first actual position professionally teaching .  Olive Stone: No, I was an assistant professor of sociology at Montevallo  .  SG: Oh, I see . You were also on the faculty outside of this program.  Stone : Oh yes, ob indeed. In fact, the program was in the sociology  department . Yes, I was an assistant professor . I was recruited by the  State Department in cooperation with Montevallo College .  SG : So you did teach other courses too, then?  Stone: Oh yes . And the students bad other professors including the  head of the Department of Sociology and Professor John Steelman, a young  Ph .D. from the University of North Carolina .  SG: Ob I see, I did not realize that .  Stone: Oh yes . I taught casework, which was the basic course on  helping individuals . But I also taught group work and supervised field practice  which was an accredited course . My greatest dream was to have settlement  houses in those backwoods areas where the children and the families could  come together and talk over problems and solve tbemo  SF : Did you try and establish one?  2  Stone: We couldn't raise that much money, I knew. But what we did  was, you see, to use a neighborhood approach. Each of my students was  assigned to a school district and handled all the problems: court cases,  adoption, foster care, medical and psychiatric care, and school attendance.  They got their scholarships through the school attendance program because  the school superintendent had the funds. We had three methods in social  work: community organization, group work and casework. Casework's always  been the dominant method, i.e., helping individuals, through a therapeuti  approach. But we had to, in the rural area, do all three. Each student had  a specific area with a school to report to and discuss such problems as  illness, retardation, child labor, deliquency. We set up a tonsillectomy  clinic and did other things to improve the community. We bad to hospitalize  a man in the mental hospital, gather data in a juvenile case of murder, etc.  So yes, I was an assistant professor, attended faculty meetings, and  taught classroom courses as well as supervising field practice.  SG: I see. And that was in the department of sociology. Did you  have an opportunity to actually stay on there, but decided to.  Stone: Oh yes. I was offered the deanship and an associate professorship  at Huntingdon so I got a rank up [laughter] in the academic line. That  was my alma mater and the president invited me. And the president of  Montevallo invited me back to make the Sunday night commencement address  to the student body because I had become active all over the state in  educational and humanitarian causes or was known for those things through  the Montevallo project and the state conference of social work of which I  was program chairman.  3  SG: Now what was your ma.in focus at Huntingdon then? You had  obviously made a choice that besides the actual fieldwork you wanted to  teach.  Stone: Oh yes. I had already taught the academic courses and, as I  say, I was on the faculty in both colleges. The offer from Huntingdon gave  a rise in position and the opportunity to practice my social work counseling  with students, to help them both with individual problems as they came to me  and with group organization to achieve certain goals in campus programs. One  of the biggest things I tried to do at Huntingdon was to help democratize the  student activities. Some few outstanding leaders held all the offices. And  the students, as we talked about how they could spread the opportunity for  experience and leadership, set up a point system in which no student could  hold more than a certain number of offices. And those with natural leadership  ability or experience, of course, continued to hold the major positions,  but they passed around other posts and involved the shyer students And a  far more democratic approach prevailed.  SG: Now this was before the Depression, and then you were there  through the Depression.  Stone: Ah. I came in 1929, and the Wall Street collapse occurred  right then. But earlier than that, beginning in 1925, at least, there'd  been a farm depression. I came home from Chicago, you will recall, at my  father's death in 1926, and I tried to collect debts that were owed to him  from farmers who had used his oil mill and gin. Farmers had received only  five or six cents a pound for cotton and they were strapped. I collected a  few but my heart went out to those people who were in debt [laughter] and we  tried to balance that off as best we could.  4  SG: What effect did that have on the composition of the student body  then at Huntingdon, compared to when you were a student, for instance?  Stone : Oh, students continued to come . The school grew . When I was  a student there were less than three hundred students; when I came back  there were about six hundred. They came, but they were poor and they didn ' t  want to perpetuate their social clubs, and suggested that they be abolished .  The college had ruled out sororities when I was there, but we formed social  clubs that were just as exclusive; you know how that happens . So now the  students sensing the costliness decided that they would rather abandon social  clubs and have departmental clubs such as, International Relations, Scribblers  Club, History Club, and what was called "League Forum . " They continued with  a lot of the traditional activities such as the Fire Frolic in the fall and  the Mayday inauguration of the student president . But in her History of  Huntingdon, Rhoda Ellison said that one of my contributions as dean was to  add something of a larger social outlook rather than just a picnic in the Fire  Frolic and dances on the green on Mayday. At the inauguration of student  president there was serious consideration of goals for the next year . Other  events also provided greater vision or world outlook.  SG : But the Mayday also never included the conception of Mayday as a  workers ' holiday?  Stone: No . Students thought of it mainly as a nostalgic Homecoming .  When the primroses were blooming down over the lovely campus against the  hawthorne hedge we set up a stage for the ~y Queen ' s Court and the dance  drama . And it is still a time for reunions, boosting of the Huntingdon  spirit and altruistic goals .  SG : Now, was Montevallo a co-educational school, or it was also &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  5  Stone: No, it was a girls' school . It was a state college, whereas  Huntingdon was a church college.  SG: Did you have very definite preferences about teaching at a girls'  school compared to coed?  Stone: No. And both of them have become coed. In fact, while I was  dean at Huntingdon, young men in the community asked for permission to come  in as day students since many couldn't afford to go away to college, either  private colleges or state . And so I think the Depression hastened the  co-educational movement. Quite a number of Alabama. girls had become coeds at  the University of Alabama and what now is Auburn University. But typically  in a coeducational school, as I've mentioned, the girl becomes the secretary  and the men hold the main offices .  SG: That ' s why I wondered if you, as a single career woman, had made  a choice to pick women ' s schools in those earlier days, rather than a coed  school.  Stone: To go to school?  SG: No, as a faculty person .  Stone: I accepted the school that the State had chosen for that  training course at Montevallo, and it happened to be for women, but I  think it was chosen because Mrs . Tunstall, the state Director of Child  Welfare, was able to recruit mainly women . In fact, I had no male students,  though they would have been acceptable for the program. Mrs . Tunstall had  had a back.ground of child labor work, and had been able with Mr. Tunstall's  help to establish a broader program. She had a very wide interest in human  welfare . I liked that, and I went where she recruited me to go. [Interruption]  j  6  SG: So that the choice to go to Huntingdon was just that the opportunity  opened up .  Stone: Yes . But I was to be the first Dean of Women who was not  middle -aged--well, I was middle -aged, I was thirty-two . But I was the  youngest Dean of Women they had ever had . The president, President Walter D.  Agnew, who had gone to Columbia University for his Ph .D. , though he was a  clergyman in background, had written his dissertation on student participation  . He wanted, when Mrs . Sturdivant resigned after many, many years, to  put in a modern approach, and he knew I 'd had the social work training to  do it . He invited me and I was flattered and pleased to be asked back to  my alma mater to organize a modern program.  SG : Now, up until the time that you went to Huntingdon &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  Stone : As a teacher?  SG : .as a teacher, and the Depression, you hadn ' t really been  involved in any of the movements up until then . It had mainly been research .  Stone : Except through the social workers ' organizations and the church .  But don ' t forget Mrs . Callis ' visit to Montevallo and the interracial composition  of state and national conferences of social work.  SG : And it was primarily the social worker ' s task rather than organizations  for social change thrust .  Stone : Yes except insofar as social workers always push for change  at the same time that they try to help clients adjust to reality. State and  national conferences combine papers on research with those proposing changes  in legislation, programmatic reform, etc . Survey and Survey Graphic were  more involved in social issues than in personal problems .  SG : Well, how did you then become involved &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; You had mentioned  once before that the Depression, you thought, had one of the major effects  7  on your thinking in terms of social change .  Stone: Yes it did, as did my year in war-devastated Europe in 1923-24,  during which I heard the famous woman preacher, Maude Royden, met the great  friend of East Indian independence, E. Stanley Jones, visited Toynbee Hall,  and learned of the Webbs and other Fabian Socialists . I read Shaw ' s expose  of imperialistic motives of the Allies . In Italy I had first-hand acquaintance  with followers of Mussolini . One follower tried to convert me thru  a free subscription to the Fascist newspaper . And remember that I also  spent a year and several summers at the University of Chicago with its mindstretching  influences .  SG: Now was it during that first year that you also instituted this  exchange with the students from the black college? Was that during the first  year also?  Stone: Yes, as I have already told you, our white students had their  eyes and ears opened when they heard the black students in their dormitories  chatting, as our students would, about their dates, their clothes, and what  they liked about this event or that . They 'd never thought of Negroes in  anything but servile roles . So they began to think a good deal about Negroes  as people . True there were setbacks as when a singer and her accompanist  from the Negro college performed at a Huntingdon convocation . They were  warmly applauded but afterward I happened to see a Huntingdon music major  wash the piano keys before sitting down to rehearse for her recital. We  did start an exchange . But I think it stemmed in pa.rt from my Y.W. C.A. work  in Houston with a few minorities at a period of time when I didn ' t know  enough to get involved in the issues of social reform.  SG : So that first year at Huntingdon, that focused on &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  8  Stone: That focused on human relations and interchange of people at  a level of human beings, not class or race . My family and I spent Christmas  in Cuba, but that was before Castro .  Then after a year ' s intensive work on campus with half of my vacation  at Camp Grandview as a counselor to poor children, I popped up to New York  for Othello with Paul Robeson, Jose Ferrer and Uta Hagen, as well as the  * rollicking Green Pastures with Richardson as "God . "  I've always loved to travel, you know . I ' ve gone to Europe many times,  and all the other continents and countries . But it was not until the second  summer that Kay Hardeman left for India and I decided to take a trip with  the International Student Hospitality Association . This was a trip to the  Scandinavian countries and Russia .  SG : Before that, though hadn ' t you already &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  Stone : That was '31 .  SG : But before ' 31 you had already gotten involved in other things,  hadn ' t you? When did this study group begin?  Stone: Clotilde (Brand) and I couldn ' t recall when we talked over  long distance . She thought maybe after I got back from Russia, and I agree .  There was a lecture series in Montgomery that, mainly, the liberal-minded  Jewish women sponsored, and we heard challenging lectures there, including  one by John Strachey on "The Coming Struggle for Power ." And the Depression  and all this led us to think tba t maybe some of us should get together .  Clotilde (Brand) was in the Presbyterian Church, and her pastor, she reminded  me, Rev . Dr . McGuire, organized a peace group . She conferred with him about  peace and social justice and so forth . But the pressure from the Presbyterians  ma.de him resign the office --not the church . He had to choose between the two,  it seemed . But she (who had been a graduate of Huntingdon College) and  *by Marc Connelly  9  several others (about half a dozen, maybe more than that), some who had had  the tutelage of the liberal Rabbi Benjamin Goldstein and some from other  churches (Methodists, Baptists and so on), had gotten an international outlook.  So they used to meet and I joined in occasionally. I wouldn't at all call  it a Marxist study group (as Virginia Durr, who was not in Montgomery,  speculated later), because we had no interest in those little theoretical  doctrinaire differences, the Trotskeyites and so on.  SG: What were you reading? Do you recall?  Stone: Well now, Rabbi Goldstein loved to talk about teleological  questions and a whole range of social philosophy, and we did some reading.  I don't recall any systematic reading by the group. For my classes (and  earlier at the University of Chicago) I was reading Thorsten Veblem, George  Bernard Shaw and the Fabians, Charles and Mary Beard, Thomas Payne, Bertram  Russell, Harry Elmer Barnes, Herbert Adolphus Miller, Wm. I. Thomas. And I  recall very vividly the fact that we had Jeanette Rankin as a speaker--the  Congresswoman who voted, you know, against the First World War--and we all  began to feel that if we could just get more permanent peace that a lot of  problems would be solved. So the peace emphasis was very strong in those  early days. And I became aware of--I don 9t know who came to recruit for  the Fellowship of Reconciliation--but it was under their sponsorship that I  went in 1932 to Asia and around the world.  SG: So that it seems like the first involvement was through peace  rather than through civil rights.  Stone: It was definitely after the trip to Russia that I met WebQter  Powell and Ofia&#177;J.&#163;s Garland, whose Garland Foundation money supported Web's  "Farm Research, Inc." It was in Washington in the fall of 1932 that Farm  Research was established, just before the New Deal was inaugurated. I went  1  \  10  back to Washington in the summer of 1933 and when several economists and  sociologists who had gathered at the research bureau decided to launch a  "School on Wheels," I invited four sociology graduates to join us in  II Michigan for a few weeks . Three came .  Meanwhile three streams of influence led to my joining the rural project  in Michigan and subsequently assisting the sharecroppers in Alabama . Dorothy  Garrett (Melzer), a roommate in Chicago and a fellow teacher at Montevallo  College, had gone home to Dadeville following her father ' s death, to assist  her mother in assuming his post as clerk of the Circuit Court . She came to  Montgomery for reasons neither of us now recalls and spent the night with  me . It was late summer of 1931 I think (or maybe 1932) and she gave me a  vivid description of the July conflict between Sheriff Young and the Share  Croppers Union. Her account of the trial appears in my di ssertation on  "Agrarian Conflict in Alabama" and was used after I moved to the Upper South  in talks I made to illustrate the desperate need of rural people . The second  stimulus was a visit from Jerry Ingersoll, the Amherst graduate who went to  Scandinavia and Russia with me . He was on a tour of the South and told me of  his interest in Midwest milk strikes and Farm Holiday actions just before the  New Deal . A third force , which was both cause and effect was the TVA grant  I received to hire two unemployed researchers to get documentary material of  the 186o's for use as background data in my growing interest in civil rights  for the Negro farmer . The research focused on Reconstruction and provided  dramatic illustrations of the newly freed slaves ' hunger for education and  enfranchisement .  SG : Well maybe we should back up, because it sounds like all of this  occurs after that trip to the Scandinavian countries and the Soviet Union.  Stone : Yes . I was much in demand as speaker at all the clubs, men ' s  luncheon clubs such as Rotary and women ' s literary and social clubs . And  11  the press praised me in their editorials, even, because I tried to help  people see that we must not use the American yardstick to measure what was  happening in backward Russia . Russian peasants were illiterate and the  church, it was claimed, had exploited or been an "opiate to the ma.sse s ."  Any political party was allowed to speak, one wit remarked, so long as only  one was in power and the others were in jail. [laughter]  SG : What do you think was the motivation in going? Were you seeking  to evaluate what a socialist solution would be? Was that it?  Stone : In going to the Scandinavian countries? Probably, to some  extent . But when I was in Europe in '23 and '24 everybody was scared to  death of Russia . My sister and I went to fifteen countries, but we skipped  Russia, because we thought that would be a little too frightening . Then we  ended up that year on a Mediterranean trip on which there was a professor  Ber ard Stern from Columbia University who gave me very unsettling ideas.  He was already involved in economic solutions of a more radical nature. And  I had only a fine arts and humanities background- -hadn ' t gone to the Univer sity  of Chicago at that time . He wrote me when he began editing a magazine,  Science and Society, and said he remembered that Mediterranean trip--this  was ten years after we had made it--and said that he had heard from mutual  friends that I had become interested in the social sciences . And I wrote--  I had the letter here - -that I did attribute to that contact with him in the  twenties questions being raised in my mind beyond just the YoW.C.A.-type of  human interest in other races, other religions, and other nationalities, and  so on : these disquieting thoughts of his that maybe we should do something  about the government and the discriminations and so on . To some extent that  caused me to switch to first social service administration and then sociology.  -.  12  SG: Well, when you started having these thoughts, and then when you  went to the Soviet Union and the socialist countries, were you beginning to  think in terms of socialist economic solutions, or  Stone : No , I had a combination of curiosity and concern . B;y no means  was I'. ready [laughter] to commit myself, you know, wholeheartedly to that,  but at least to begin to question some of the basic institutions and to  consider reforming the church and reforming the local and state governments .  I was always a reformer [laughter] rather than a revolutionary.  SG: So you did think in terms of questions of reforming the existing  institutions .  Stone: &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226; Existing institutions, not abolishing churches [laughter]  or religion or so on, because I felt that these were basic avenues through  which people had lived and expressed themselves, and that they could take  hold of them and &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  SG : Now the tour was actually organized by Laidler and the L. I .D. ?  Stone : He had to do it through the tour guide, the International  Student Hospitality Association which, I think, was not socialistic . We  had to have Scandinavian-speaking people and Russian-speaking people -to be  our tour guides, you know . "Intourist" took over in Russia, and the  International Student Hospitality in the three little Scandinavian countries  that we visited.  SG : Well, how many of you were there on the tour? What were the  other people's background?  Stone : Quite a variety. There were men and women . Dr . La.idler ' s  sister -in-law was one, and she just came out of interest and enjoyed the  travel . They were older than I . He bad done bis Doctoral work writing  I  13  on utopias, and he has a book on that, you know, and came to join the  socialist party. Then one member of our tour was a journalist connected  with Fortune magazine . She was an in -law of Corliss Lamont, a philosophy  professor whose father was a billionaire [laughter] in Wall Street? I  have a book of his . Then a man who was just a farmer, a midwesterner who  was curious about Russia . And one was a preacher who decided, as I recall  (and his wife more than he) that "My, my, they must get on with social  religion ." Jerry Ingersoll bad just graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Amherst  College .  SG: There were about a dozen of you, then?  Stone: I think fewer; I think we were eight for most of the time . So  we had great opportunities for Laidler to point out the superiority of  socialism over communism. And then we went by Vienna at the end of this  trip and there was a big international socialist convention in Vienna . That  was an eye-opener to me . I didn' t go to any of the talks, but to see the  huge parades . You see, following the First World War Austria had gone  socialist. I don't know where they were, whether they were on the verge  of being taken over by Hitler by this time, 1931. No, at least the Fascist  movement was growing in Germany and elsewhere . But the main thing I got at  the Vienna International Conference was that it was the first international  conference I ' d ever attended, and it seemed interesting to find people speaking  many languages and coming together on common social issues and causes.  That was impressive, I think. And afterwards I sent contributions to the  L.I .D. (League for Industrial Democracy)--just financial contributions .  SG: How much time did you spend in the Soviet Union?  Stone: About three weeks in all . We went to only the western part  of Russia. What we did is, from Scandinavia we went across to Finland, and  ...  II  II  14  had only one hour of darkness in that beautiful passage; you know, "gorgeous  long summer" and so we landed in Finland and came down through Leningrad,  and saw the fabulous museums, attended the Bolshoi Ballet and did the usual  sights. But met people--well, we had the Intourist guide, who always  pointed out how much better it is under Communism than it used to be. And  indeed that was true.  SG: But you didn't meet with people from these various agencies, for  instance, there. It was more a tourist point of view?  Stone: No. We had several Americans who had moved over there out of  the attraction. There was a woman who had been, I think., a Quaker or in  some &#183;religious group here, who was living there, and she came and talked  to us. Laidler knew a lot of the people who could speak. English and could  come and talk with us. And he helped arrange that, I think..  SG: So in other words, you heard from many of the American emigres who  still were there, and who had gone over shortly after the revolution. You  met with some of those people?  Stone: Yes, some of those people. But the main thing is we visited  the Russian people's parks, factories, farms and institutions. And from  time to time as we were going along on any tour, a young woman or young man  would just hop out in the street and dance and say: "It's my country now!"  I told you about the old fisherman. When we were in Kiev we wanted to go up  on the Dnieper River. A grizzly old man with a beard got our boat stuck on  a sand bar and didn't know how to get it off, because it was a motor boat  and he'd never driven anything like that. So our young college student  Jerry Ingersoll and the other men lifted the boat off. The old man said  to the guide: "Please tell them: 'When culture has come to our people I  15  will be able to thank them in their own language . ' " [laughter] And we  thought it was very sweet that he now felt that he had a little role here,  and that the country belonged to him, and that the culture would spread.  About this time Frankwood Williams, a psychiatrist from the U. S. , bad  visited Russia, and I had read his articles in the Survey Graphic . He went  over to visit Russia ' s mental hospitals . He asked that be be shown the  hos pi ta ls. They said, "First we' 11 take you to the cultural parks . " He  thought he would indulge them and go to the "Parks of Leisure and Culture."  And he saw people, you know, enjoying these huge people ' s parks . Then he  said, ''Now may we go to some hospitals?" "Well," they said, "suppose we  visit the nurseries at the factories; and suppose we do this, and suppose we  do that." And finally he lost patience . They said : "Well, I'm afraid  there are not many people in the hospitals anymore . [laughter] We have a  night hospital and a day hospital . People go out and work. They live with  their families . Some of them can ' t stay the full twenty-four hours; they  come and sleep at the hospital . Others have to stay in the hospital in the  i lso  daytime, but can go home to their families at night ." We visited both day  and night hospitals .  I was interested in prison reform, and we visited some of the prisons.  We could ask for things on this trip that we wanted to visit . I bad read a  lot on penology but this was the first time I ' d come upon the idea of prisons  having no bars with prisoners who could come and go . Well, you see it was  controlled by ration cards . They couldn't get out of prison until they'd  learned a trade and didn ' t have to steal, or didn ' t have to do the things  that got them in jail in the first place . There was a great feeling that  the prostitutes would lose their interest in this way of earning a living  16  if they were trained to do something else . And there was great faith in  environmental change : the belief that people from any background (prisoners,  prostitutes or whatever) once they had education and opportunity and jobs  would have their problems solved . Frankwood Williams came back feeling conthe  value psychologically of  fident of/this kind of a participatory government of a socialist nature .  had what they cailed "state socialism"--  The Russians/never claimed in those days that the country was communist;  they were "on the road to communism." When they got there, you know, [laughter]  it became --I 'm sorry to say, in the Stalin days quite a dictatorship, but in  Lenin ' s day &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; I ' ll give one more illustration . Russia didn ' t give up  its religion, it just reformed it . You remember, people were still going  to churches, and that couldn ' t be stopped . But one of the men in the Quaker  group, I believe, who spoke to us said (he spoke Russian) that children at  play would say: " I give you my Lenin ' s word of honor o" [laughter] So that  they had a new god or hero or whatever .  SG : So by this time Stalin had already consolidated his power &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  Stone : Oh no, this was &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  SG : You 're talking about 1931.  Stone: Yes . Did he come to power then?  SG : Oh yes, Lenin died in 1924 .  Stone : Ah yes, I guess he did .  SG : But the fact is, what you saw on the tours was still a country that  was . . . .  Stone : The last year of the first five year plan, and that was very  different from the later five year plans . There was infectious enthusiasm  and tremendous speed- up because they wanted to catch up , and they gave many  inducements for people to work extra hours for extra pay . They had groups in  17  the factories that met and criticized their leaders, and they had wall  newspapers that people wrote on. And beautiful posters; I had a wonderful  collection of them. I used to display them in Montgomery when I talked  about my trip and said that one of the things I missed in Russia was (tongue  in cheek) the long commercials on Ipana toothpaste and all the other advertisements.  They just had a single brand of everything. But these beautiful  posters trying to get people together and do for each other, and to sacrifice  for the state and so on &#8226;  No, I didn't see any of Stalin's abuses and didn't know. The purges  hadn't started, and while he had consolidated his power he was not as ruthless  in those days. And the people really felt that the country belonged to them  at that time.  SG: Well, what effect did this have on your thinking in terms of the  kind of progressive involvement that then you began to experience?  Stone: Well, I felt I needed to be identified with larger national or  southern programs. And when I came back I did get busy with the F.O.R., or  whatever the peace group was that preceded it,and with our discussion group.  But I always felt--at least for a long time before I came out here--that I  had an obligation to the South, and that I should continue to teach there  and to work there in order to, in a southern way and through southern  channels, bring about reform--help bring about reform for races and classes.  SG: When you came back would be about the time that the Alabama sharecroppers  were beginning to &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  Stone: Yes, and I heard about the sharecropper ' s massacres, as I have  told you.  I thought I'd like to see for myself what the organization was like,  18  and so I went with several former students and with one of those organizers  who followed Sid Benson* He took us there to visit one of their organizations.  And one or two of the men, when they heard my name, said : "Your father was  the sweetest, finest landlord we ever had; he would always help get us out of  jail when we got arrested for drunkenness or rowdiness : he 'd come out of  bed to give us some money to pay our fines ."  SG: So you went, actually, to one of the local groups, then?  Stone : At a meeting on a Sunday, when they got together there . My  heart was touched and I wanted to help . And I did make financial contributions,  as I told you . . . .  BEGIN SIDE II TAPE I  SG: You had mentioned that you had to support them very quietly because  of something about the sheriff in your own county.  Stone : Yes, the danger to the sharecroppers . If they saw that anybody  was sending any money or helping them then the Sheriff would brutalize them  all the more .  SG: Now how did you happen to meet Gelders, do you recall?  Stone: Long after this fellow, Sid Benson*, had gone, Gelders was a  professor of physics at the University of Alabama, and as a native of Birmingham  he became interested in the rights of coal miners and steel workers . I  met him after I left Alabama . As a member or perhaps organizer of something  called the"National Committee for Defense of Political Prisoners," he was  seized in Birmingham and beaten up severely .  SG : Right; now that would be a little bit later, though .  Stone : He was kidnapped there . That would be in the later period;  it was after I &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  * Benson must have told us of the sharecroppers altho he was an industrial  union organizer, as I have finally recalled. See Part IV , p 11, 1. 10  19  SG: You had met him earlier though.  Stone: No, I met him after I went to Chapel Hill, and .Richmond.  SG: But this letter to the sheriff, though; wouldn't that have been  in early thirties, about the time of the trial? In '31 or so? *  Stone: No. Kyle Young was sheriff during the trials . [machine turned  off]  SG: But your reason for being very quiet in your support of the  Sharecroppers Union was primarily in terms of that if the sheriff saw there  was wider support he would see them as a more viable group and be much  more &#8226; . &#8226;&#8226;  Stone: True. Because in Young's first massacre he had rallied  college students home from school, and everybody was alarmed about the  racial upityness and things like this. Students, including the sheriff ' s  brother, went out thinking they were doing a good service . [telephone  interruption]  SG: What I was trying to retrace was to try to understand the need  that you felt to keep your support of the Sharecroppers quiet .  Stone: For two reasons: for the sharecroppers ' sake and for my own;  that I would cease having any usefulness in Montgomery or Alabama if I were  thought to have any sympathies--even though mine were, I thought, more  humanitarian than for civil rights.  In the late 1930 ' s when this Moss Hart, or somebody else, was  arrested I asked Joe Gelders whether he felt my making an appeal to the  sheriff who followed Young and with whom I had grown up would do any good.  And he said no. I was reluctant to do it even though I was out of Alabama;  I was then in Virginia .  *The exchange of letters with Gelders was in connection with another case,  in the late 1930's.  20  SG: But during this earlier period, I mean.  Stone: But even now I keep many contacts in Alabama, and I don't  want people to think I'm different than I am. It was moral indignation &amp; ~ sense  -of justice; desire for 'reform;- not~ &#183;for revolution. . But mainly that it  wasn't fair; it just wasn't fair to make those Negroes suffer like that when  they needed a decent income from their farms.  SG: So it would have made you less credible?  Stone: On 2 scores, .as&#183; a "nigger lover"C!wl as a "union supporte:r:."  You've no idea what enormously strong feelings there are in the South. Only  lately has it abated, you know. M:l.ny Negroes hold minor positions all over  Alabama now and Mississippi . And many of them, I have been told, feel they  can get along better in the deep South where things are clear than in the  borderland places where they never quite know whether interracial relations  are fully acceptable socially or not.  SG: So you would have been dismissed from Huntingdon?  Stone: Pressure would doabtless h~ve been attempt~d. *  SG: Was it because the communists were involved in that drive, or  because of the issue itself?  Stone: I think it would be a question of the red and the black. I  mean, some people would have been scared to death that the Negroes were  getting out of their place--though they were not striving for anything but  for economic survival. All they wanted was a chance to live and endure.  But I think, although the church had taken many stands for racial justice  such as for the abolition of the poll tax and for the abolition of lynching--  still, I think it would have meant I bad lost my usefulness, if not my job.  * Instead I have maintained uninterrupted good relations with Huntingdo ,  being awarde many honors. (See correspondence with Pres. &amp; Chairman, Trustees)  21  And it just wasn't worth it. It would do the sharecroppers harm; no good  at all. But I felt that during the time that they were being thrown off  their lands and threatened they needed some financial help, which I gave.  SG: Now could you describe--because we did that off tape--the way in  which you quietly &#8226;  Stone: This black organizer of the union--Murphy who used the name of  Albert Jackson--would telephone me when he was in Montgomery and could  receive some help from me. We met at the largest post office downtown and  I left money on one of the counters, which he picked up, in cash. We had  no correspondence, but just the telephonic communication. After I had  visited the community near my home town, you know, I had recognized how  competent the organizer was and the SCU too to manage things for themselves,  and this would help with some of the survival problems . They were not large  contributions, $50 or $100 at a time.  SG: But even then it had to be done very quietly.  Stone: Had to be done very quietly, because I think that if they had  been known to be soliciting funds in the white community it might have been  held against them; might have given more trouble to their organization that  they were trying to get widespread support . And I would not be doing it  except as an individual; there was no organization that was going to be  involved, you see.  SG: But I thought it was important in terms of your growth . Now in  other words, then, you always had to tread a very narrow path while you were  at the school, both in terms of the reputation you gained as the Red Dean  because of your travels &#8226; &#8226;  Stone: Yes, because I didn't know it--as I think I told you, not on  the tape- -my wonderful President received many complaints from the community.  j  22  I remember one day in the hall a lady of very high station greeted me a little  cooly--this was at the college. And I said something or she did--I forget how  the matter came up--regarding the D.A.R &#8226;&#8226; I have no idea why I would have  been talking about the D.A.R. to this lady, except that maybe she brought  up the subject and I said that I had membership in the Dadeville Chapter.  And she said: "People are not members unless they are invited by the local  chapter." [laughter]  SG: Was this the first sign you had gotten of the displeasure with  your position?  Stone: Yes. Well, I know that the newspapers carried delightful  reports on my talks, and that even the editor had said as I have mentioned  that I had given some insight into what was happening in Russia compared to  this country--that we mustn't apply the American ethic.  SG: Had you ever been denounced?  Stone: No, at no time was I denounced in the papers. So it was sort  of a sub rosa kind of displeasure. Some individuals came out to the College  and protested. One such individual had mainly ancestry to brag about. My  friends and I talked about this, that she may have been one of the people  talking against But Dr. Agnew never told me.  SG: Well, how did he manage to balance between your activities and  the pressures he faced from the community?&#183;  Stone: Well, he believed in me and he took me to meetings of the  ministerial union. I remember how shocked I was at one of the first that I  attended, before I had gone to Russia or anywhere. I heard a preacher say:  "They (the Depression poor) even expect us to bury people without a fee.  '  23  I say 'let the dead bury the dead.'" That just bowled me over [laughter].  I couldntt imagine in a Depression a preacher withholding his services to a  bereaved family and having a callous financial attitude. Well, I didn't say  that to him. I just listened and marveled [laughter]. But President Agnew  did take me occasionally there, and had me speak sometimes. And then he  took me around to the churches to give a dramatic reading of Charles Rand  Kennedy's play, "A Servant in the House," which had a great social message,  you know; that you can serve in the basement of the church as well as [laughter]  in the choir and the big steeples. Well, at any rate, I gave the reading, you  know, because it had a religious message and a social message. He thought  that would &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226; People came out in large numbers. I spoke at Sunday evening  church meetings, and there was always a good congregation. It may be, I don't  know or didn't know then, they were attracted to hear what this dean would  say. [laughter]  I was also president of the Deans of Women's Association for the state,  so I was invited to the University of Alabama and other places to talk.  SG: was most of the pressure, though, around your speaking about your  trip to the Soviet Union rather than about interracial work, then, at this  point in Montgomery?  Stone: Well, I think that reputation &#8226;  There was another thing that I reviewed with Clotilde Brand this  morning by long distance. About this time--I forget whether it was between  the Russia trip and my trip around the world--that a woman who was a bishop's  widow from the Episcopal church, Mrs. Speed* like "Bishop Brown," the  pamphleteer, wanted to spread the message that communism was the last word.  *sister of a prominent woman in Montgomery named Mrs. Nash Reed, who was  active in little theater work and a good many good causes like that.  r  24  Her daughter Jane had been in boarding school in Austria, then married and  lived abroad, watching with alarm the rise of Hitler . Their prominent relatives,  the Reeds, joined Rabbi Goldstein in quietly protesting prison deaths  of sharecroppers . Because of my talks on Russia the Speeds tried to have me  join them. Several of us felt that they did a good deal of harm to liberals  like ourselves in Montgomery trying to tie up with us .  To return to the Study Groups, we had provided a sort of waystation to  Sid Benson, who must have spent the night somewhere- -Clotilde and I didn ' t  know . But we always fed him, because we wanted to hear [laughter] what was  happening . And our little group of eight or ten people or so in Montgomery  SG: And were these people from the study group, you mean?  Stone : Yes, the study group . We would usually, if Sid came to town  and he phoned somebody (maybe the Rabbi or maybe someone else), get together  and see what he had been up to, and see what were his problems . I don ' t  remember contributing anything to him. The only time I gave any financial  assistance to that sharecropper group was through his successor*, a black  organizer, as I have said .  SG : So this is referring to the fact that you did start becoming this  hospitality waystation in Montgomery .  Stone : I think the group star ted then, but Clotilde and I are not  very sure about when it was . We think it was during the year I was back  from Russia . But you can tell right away that the main thing I wanted to  do on the trip to China--well , to India--was to study the Gandhian appr oach,  because I felt that that had real possibilities . It certainly was demonstrated  by the recent Martin Luther King movement, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; t he bus boycott and other  nonviolent protests . And that ' s what I wanted ; I wanted nonviolent change .  * See footnote p. 18  l  SG: Before that trip--because the trip was made in '32 &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  Stone: Yes, for six months.  SG: You took a leave then?  . Rart of  Stone: I took;one semester's leave and a summer.  25  SG: Now before the trip though, when Highlander School was already  developing, were you associated with it then?  Stone: Not in '32. I heard about it in 1934, as best I can recall.  But here I have a letter from Myles Horton dated 1934 and referring to our  having met in Chattanooga two years earlier. Myles thinks this was called  by Sid Benson, also known as Ted Wellman .  And I never did visit Commonwealth, which started in the twenties and  was &#8226; begun as a Utopian colony, you know, in Louisiana. I just read  about it, because I never visited it.  SG: So then the next thing would be this trip to the Far East in 1932.  Stone: Yes.  SG: And up until this point the civil rights involvement was this  more quiet support of the sharecroppers; in other words, there were no other  civil rights activities up until the time of the second trip?  Stone: True. Before I left Huntingdon I had realized that there was  hardly anything looked upon more unfavorably in the South--other than race  and the red menace, than Yankee interference. I was very sympathetic with  Roger Baldwin's American Civil Liberties Union; I contribute regularly to it,  and have for many years. But at that time, while 1 had no prejudice against  the North [laughter]--I had gone to school in Boston and Chicago and I had  lived many summers and had known many people in the North--I was sensitively  aware of southern prejudices, and that if anybody tried to organize a branch  of the American Civil Liberties Union that would be considered &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  26  SG : That was actually your first &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; when you left Huntingdon to  organize the Southern Committee for People ' s Rights would be the beginning  of the black civil rights involvement, then?  Stone: Not the blacks alone .  SG : But still the focus in Montgomery was primarily &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  Stone : The year before I left- -April or May 1933--I joined professional  people from eleven Southern states in Atlanta to form the Southern League for  People ' s Rights, predecessor of the Southern Committee . The focus in  Montgomery became that of peace .  SG: Initially on peace .  Stone : And child welfare, the usual humanitarian things . I was also  teaching school [laughter] you seem to forget and I was doing some writing-not  as much as I should have; I had so many community obligations .  SG : As dean?  Stone : Yes . And, unhappily, since I 'd been a student and graduate  and alumna of Huntingdon I had many friends , and I didn ' t learn until I went  to William and Mary not to agree to play bridge or join a social club .  [laughter]  SG : Now how did you happen to make the decision, then, for that Far  Eastern trip where you took the time off?  Stone : In part to pursue the nonviolent Ghandian approach . I had  become very interested through my reading and Kay Hardeman ' s departure for  India . A former classmate from Huntingdon bad planned to go with me largely  for pleasure and culture . But she was a victim of the Wall Street debacle  and couldn ' t go . So I went alone and did all my booking ; went on ten  different steamers --there was no air travel in those days, so it took a  27  while to get around. I started by going over to Geneva and meeting with  Mr. Donald Grant, the head of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation  (F.O.R.).  SG: You were tied to both the F.OoR. and the Women's International  League for Peace and Freedom, then?  Stone: I just met the Women's International League for Peace and  Freedom when in Geneva. But the Fellowship of Reconciliation had worked at  home as well as internationally, so it was a chain around the world. And  then when I got to Japan, you know, I had very fine contacts there, including  one from an Alabama Justice to his missionary brother. I was booked to  lecture by the F.O.R. all over Japan, and met  SG: And what would be the thrust of your lectures?  Stone: On American economic imperialism. You see, Britain was &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  SG: Did you use the word imperialism?  Stone: Yes, economic imperialism.* I barely mentioned British &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  you see, everybody was against British imperialism. And I said: "Britain  may be geographically the largest component of this, and therefore entitled  to some criticism or investigation about it But America doesn't have to  acquire territory--it does have the Philippines-- .. its economic exploitation  is just as controlling as geographic domination of other countries." At one  of the lectures that I gave in Japan, the British Church of England people  attacked me bitterly. They didn't like what I said about England. And I  thought I was very polite and kind. I don't know whether I even used the  word, but if I did I quoted what people were saying about British imperialism.  And I said: "I do not think we should be unaware of the American kind of  imperialism." And I also mentioned the Philippines.  * My words, acc. to a draft I still have, were, "I come to you with deep consciousness  and sorrow at my country's overt or covert practice of imperialism,  militarianism, and racial injustice &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226; " (See letters from Japanese FOR)  ..  !  I  I !  11  28  SG: But when you spoke there, then, you spoke about the American  situation. And you were traveling to gather information about &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; &#8226;  Stone : Well, all over the world . But I didn ' t want to say, you know,  everybody else is wrong and we ' re so very democratic and sweet and kind  [laughter] .  Incidentally, all of this time I realized, and more fully when I got  to Chapel Hill, that the northern " industrial carpetbaggers" were practicing what  we finally identified as "economic colonialism" in the South: giving us  disadvantageous freight rates and everything else . And our cheap labor was  what Northern manufacturers wanted . They didn ' t care about helping the South  develop [laughter]; they wanted to come down and get our cheap labor . And our  low taxes : we gave them tax-free places to put up their factories, and so on .  And the Chapel Hill group did emphasize this economic colonialism.  SG : But the nature of American economic colonialism, when you were  speaking in ' 32, was not that widely . . . .  Stone : No, I didn ' t use that term. I used the word imperialism because  that was what people were saying : that in other countries our attitude is  not one to help them to become democracies, but one to take the same advantage  of them as, I later learned, was being done in the South by the Northern  industrialists .  SG: Now when you came back from that trip, is that when your greater  involvement with labor groups began? After that trip and that School on  Wheels?  Stone &#183; Oh, yes . That was a farm thing, but with organized farm  groups yes . Farmers ' Union had a &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  SG: But would that be the first real involvement then with the labor  unions?  29  Stone: Yes, yes. And I think that's the first time that I had gone to  Washington to plan how my former students (sociology majors) and I could  participate in a real live farm community of the middle West, because there  were no such unions--at least I didn't know about them--in the South. And  so we went. Robert Morse Lovett of Columbia University may have participated  in getting the idea started. I remember his coming out to visit us. And  what we did is, we took one--what do you call these trucks that are like  bread wagons, just small trucks? We took our tents and mattresses and three  of us drove on the wide front seats taking turns to get across from Washington  to Michigan. The others rode in a car. It was in Michigan, in the upper  peninsula, where they had a lot of Scandinavians and others who were very  independent farmers. They wanted to organize into Farmers' Unions because  they were being dispossessed, you know .  SG: Now these were small farmers?  And their idea of a farmers ' union was to do what, exactly?  Stone: The purpose of the school was to help them learn some of the  ways they could use their organizational skills and tactics, and what to  avoid too. And this was the first I learned such things as collective bargainjng  as it spread to the rural communities.  SG: Was the school conducted by &#8226; &#8226;  Stone: By several professors, and I was asked to join them. I think  I was the only woman professor teaching it . Jerry Ingersoll was one of the  members. He had finished college but hadn't gone off for graduate work.  Actually, we used the principle of everybody as a teacher and everybody as  a student, and they could criticize me [laughter] and the other professors  just as freely .  1  I  I  11  11  11  30  What we would do is, we had our tents and we camped beside a lake .  And then we moved to other sections and opened what we called a School on  Wheels, and invited people to come in and talk with us and discuss their  problems . My former students bad been doing social work with the Red Cross  and with relief clients in Montgomery--! still taught social work in the  sociology department at Huntingdon College, you know . And these sociology  graduates had their eyes opened, coming from privileged families, to see how  difficult it was during the Depression to face foreclosure--just as they had  seen the sorrow of people having to go on relief and admit they were poor and  couldn't make it . They found the poor were both black and white.  SG : So there were several former students on this?  Stone: Yes, graduates: two at the outset and a third near the close .  Minneola Perry, who married Jerry Ingersoll . She stayed on and didn ' t come  back to Montgomery .  SG: In other words, this group of you who were primarily professors in  various colleges served almost as a traveling consultant service, in a  sense .  Stone: Yes, yes . It was sort of like Highlander Folk Schoo , except  that Highlanders were stable and we traveled . Highlander also went out to  the communities: Appalachia and the mining areas and the textile mills . And  they composed labor songs . We used the talents of people around us to make up  any songs or we listened to their songs . So we held just a one week school,  or two weeks- -it usually was one week, because we moved on . We weren ' t gone  more than about three weeks in all before attending a state farm conference .  [Later I went to a national farm conference . ]  31  SG: Now when you had the one week school, for instance, how would you  let the community know you were due?  Stone: They had their Farmers ' Unions, and so they used the school as  a means of recruitment, in a way, for the unions . You see, they 'd hear there  were these people coming in who were authorities on living conditions and  possible solutions to problems . Farm Research, Inc . , in Washington had  provided us with much data and I had some from TVA .  SF: Would that TVA project have been after this school?  Stone: Completed afterward but begun before &#8226; Division for  Compilation of Basic Data--fascinating title .  SG: Now how did this come to be organized, the whole idea of this School  on Wheels?  Stone : By this group of professors who had come down to Washington  before the New Deal *a nd formed the Farm Research, Incorporated . Well, I  said that Web Powell, my best friend--his widow is going with me to Alaska--  had graduated from Minnesota and had become familiar with the farmers ' movement  there and sustained this interest although he was New York born ( Fifth  Avenue) . [laughter] His mother ' s illness had brought him down to Southern  Pines, their vacation place .  SG: So in other words, was this agency Farm Research, Inc . governmentsponsored?  Stone : Oh no, no . This was a private organization . And I guess it  was financed mainly by his wealth and that of the Garland Foundation . But  Web held government jobs, both before this was organized and afterwards when  World War II came .  SG : Do you remember the nature of the classes that you would hold?  * Roosevelt had been elected but his program not yet launched, I'm reminded  I .  32  Stone: They were informal discussions of economic conditions, and  something about the privileges that large farm-owners bad compared to the  smaller ones, using our basic data from the Farm Research.  SG: Were you posing possible solutions?  Stone : We were letting them pose them. The main thing is we felt they  were on the right track in trying to use collective bargaining . Because we  felt the farmer who just depended on the general processes instead of joining  together with others wouldn ' t have a chance to buck against the farm foreclosures  and the other problems that they faced . Those who were dairy  farmers, you know, chose to pour their milk in the streets rather than get  no price for it . But we were just exploring with them the risks and  possibilities of taking action themselves as they were doing, and what were  some of the solutions that were being tried in other states .  SG: Were cooperatives at that time?  Stone: Yes, cooperative endeavors, indeed . That was one of the big  things; consumers ' cooperatives and buyers ' cooperatives, yes .  SG: And did any of them actually form out of these groups?  Stone: I don't know . I think they did . I didn ' t do any follow-up in  that, because I was then busy in the South. I thought that was good experience  for my former students and excellent experience for me to get out in an  area where farmers small farmers, bad more articulateness &#8226; In  Alabama, small farmers, white no less than black, had little political or  economic power .  SG: So this group of farmers in Michigan was a very different kind of  farmer than you bad been accustomed to .  33  Stone: Very different. Different farming and a different upstandingness.*  See, they had been great individualists, and some of them were forming Farmers'  Unions, which were different from the Grange. The Grange had been a good meeting  place for farmers, but it encouraged individual action more than collective  action. And now the Farmers' Union was a Depression-born group, as I recall  it, that believed in collective action. They could keep their independence,  and they enjoyed that: they wanted their own cows and their own homes. But  we were trying &#8226;  SG: So you saw yourselves as sort of a catalyst more than to help  them &#8226;&#8226;  Stone: Sort of a catalyst for that. But it was mainly because we really  believed in cooperative activity, whether for consumer groups or producer  organizations. It was nonpartisan as far as we were concerned. I mean, it  was not to recruit to the Farm-Labor Party or any Scandinavian-inspired  socialist organization.  * And they had no barriers to voting, such as the Southern poll tax
