S. Gluck: I think we better go back. Because we talked about the  Southern League for People ' s Rights in the last interview at the very  end. And you had recalled it as just having that founding meeting, but  not remembering if it had lasted at all. So I think we should go back  (and you didn't remember any of the names at the time) and talk about  how that might have grown into the Southern Committee for People's Rights.  Why don't we begin with that, then?  Stone: All right. The founding meeting of the Southern League for  People's Rights was held in Atlanta in the spring of 1933. Another  delegate from Montgomery and I stayed at my brother's apartment and joined  representatives from eleven Southern States in a conference room, probably  in a downtown hotel. The MONTGOMERY JOURNAL for June 6, the following year,  1934, on the occasion of my resignation from Huntingdon College, refers to  the non-partisan organization as being composed of teachers, writers,  artists, lawyers, preachers and men and women of kindred professions."  Its goals were cited as those of "academic freedom, rights of working  people, freedom from exploitation and the upholding of the rights of free  speech, press, and assembly."  SG: So you have remembered?  rather I have done some system tic investigating . ( See Letter to Garvey)  Stone: Yes, or/ Background organizations working for peace,  I  ii  ii  2  justice and human rights, some of them through the church, were mentioned in  an article on the League carried by the student newspaper at Huntington on  May 18, 1934.  SG : Do you recall who called the conference?  Stone : o, I don't . I didn ' t call it but was invited . I have spent  weeks trying to track down information beyond the news articles regarding the  League's formation. Except for Bruce Crawford, the 6 or 8 southern liberals  whom I've consulted by long distance following an explanatory letter did not  recall the meeting . I am inclined to attribute the convening to a defense  committee working on the Herndon Case . Vann Woodward remembers attending a  rally for Herndon in the fall of 1932 at the Labor Temple in Atlanta. According  to Dykeman and Stokely, biographers of Will Alexander, Woodward became  impatient with Alexander who was wary of the Herndon defense . Woodward was  chairman of the early defense but withdrew as communist influence increased .  Bruce Crawford believes that Vann Woodward and his friend Glenn Rainey  from Emory University (or Georgia Tech) dropped by. Rainey I had heard was  deceased but an Atlanta acquaintance tracked him down. He does not recall the  meeting but adds that it was just the kind of program he would have joined.  Several of the professors at Atlanta University who may have participated are  no longer alive. We did elect a chairman .  SG: And what was the name?  Stone: His name was Bruce Crawford, Editor of CRAWFORD'S WEEKLY. He  lived in orton Virginia in the western part of the state, near Kentucky.  SG: And even though he could come out as openly supporting this he was  able to keep his paper going?  Stone: Yes. He owned the paper and was so well accepted in his  native town he could go as he did that year with the Dreiser Committee  into the Kentucky coal fields to investigate disorders . He bad also  3  defended mill and mine workers at the Viginia Institute of Public Affairs.  (See his chapter on coal mines in Wm. Couch's CULTURE IN THE SOUTH.) In  addition to being independent, Crawford was flexible in his time schedule,  as was I. Because of my administrative duties as Dean of Women, I did not  teach many courses. Without neglecting any of my duties I could fill some  of them at night or on week-ends.  SG: Since your memory is refreshed, do you recall, was the idea,  then, when you left Montgomery, to convert the League over to this  Committee? It had been formed in the name of the Southern League.  Stone: There was no thought of changing the name at all. The point  is that after this lapse of time, about six months, during which I could  get no foundation support for the League we tried other approaches. Roger  Baldwin would have been very glad to have me organize a branch of the  American Civil Liberties Union but I thought the South would regard it as  we  a Yankee intrusion. Later in Virginia / invited Baldwin down to Richmond  where he readily attracted a luncheon group. Virginius Dabney, Editor of  the TIMES-DISPATCH, and Dr. S. C. Mitchell of Richmond University, among  others, came. That was after the Chapel Hill period during which the founding  members seemed to prefer the simpler title, Southern Committee for  People's Rights. The goals and methods remained the same as those spelled  out in Atlanta for the League.  I enrolled at University of North Carolina in January 1935 and through  the Maclachlans, with whom I had attended the inter-racial conference the  preceding November at Shaw University in Raleigh, I met a number of liberals  among professors of the social sciences, humanities, and elsewhere in  the University, as well as one or two preachers, a book store manager, a  journalist, etc. in the village. We talked informally as we lunched to4  gether or met in some other connection about the dynamite incident in  the Burlington Textile Mills and the shocking chaingang case that led  in March, 1935 to the amputation of both legs of two 20-year-old Negro  misdemeanants. Before the year was over, we had collected over $1500  in $1.00 membership dues and organized three chapters in Va. and N.C .  and scattered members all over the South.  SG: Once you got to Chapel Hill, how did you go about on a day to  day basis putting it together? Because here it was just you .&#8226;&#8226;  Stone: We had no formal organization except for my assuming  responsibility for the executive secretaryship, usi ng my mailbox, Box 665,  to handle correspondence, to send out flyers, and to collect dues. My  typewriter and files were used for coordinating activities. Apparently  we had 34 sponsors but not officers until 1936. Instead we had pro tem  or project chairmen. Kenroy Malcombre offered to be chairman of the  Defense Committee for the' Burlington Teoctile Workers accused of dynamiting  the mill. Paul Green to whom the legless chaingang victims made a  personal appeal, took leadership in investigating prison atrocities.  The Charlotte OBSERVER had broken the case and other newspapers joined in  / the expose. I selected prison camps as a term paper theme in a course  on "Law and Social Work 11 and interviewed the Director of N.C.'s Division  of Institutions of the State Board of Charities and Public Welfare, among  other sources of information.  We were not ready until Jan. 1936 to issue our first BULLETIN. By  then we had chosen an Editorial Board and selected from a long list of  members 17 sponsors each from Virginia and North Carolina, with the promise  to publish sponsors from other southern states in subsequent issues.  In the second issue, Mar. 1936, 6 pages rather than the customary  - -  5  4 were included in order to provide a summary of the year's organizational  progress.  SG: So were you the one that was organizing it?  Stone: I made organization trips upon invitation to Richmond and the  Virginia Peninsula where chapters were formed and in the case of the  latter group letterhead was immediately printed following the adoption of  formal by-laws. I also accepted an invitation from Dr. Ralph Bunche to  speak at a five-day conference at HoW:ard University in Washington, D.C.  My correspondence. with Bunche indicates on Mar. 22,1936 that I had served  as executive director of the Southern Committee for People ' s Rights for  approximately 15 months. This would suggest that the Maclachlans and I,  and perhaps others, had begun early in Jan. 1935 upon my arrival in Chapel  Hill to set up a functioning group.  SG: Where did you start putting it together? Because here it was  j ust you; you were going to put this thing together. How did you &#8226;  Stone: Those of us with desks in the Institute for Research would  pick each other up every night when we finished working on our dissertations  and assemble over on the main street i n Chapel Hill to havea .- cold drink &amp; c at  about the issues of the day. When some problem close at hand, such as  the Burlington dynamite case and the chaingang cruelty, occurred we had  a more formal meeting.  SG: Well how did the chaingang victims happen to choose Paul Green*  to go to?  Stone: I guess everybody just knew that Paul Green was a kind-hearted  man, and that he'd helped with many causes. I don't know how they knew  that but did come to him; and he gave the group a vivid account. Brought  * Green's "Hymn t9 the Rising Sun ," a oue-act drama was produced by Civic Repertory  Theatre in New York in Jan . 19Jb with a chaingang setting and specific  reference on p . 22 of Samuel French ' s edition to Shropshire &amp; Barnes  6  his secretary along to take down his total recall of the conversation.  SG: So the group had already formed by then?  Stone: Yes, I continued as convener, clipping bureauJ and correspondent  while carrying a full course load and completing my prospectus for the  dissertation as a whole and for the field research during the first  session of summer school. Rupert Vance was my brilliant and stimulating  chairman.  SG: Now how many were in the group then, when you first formed?  Do you recall?  Stone : I think at least a dozen. I can name Phillips Russell, Bill  Couch, J. O. Bailey, Arnold Williams, Paul Green, Stanley Stevens (he  was a graduate student in sociology). Several of the doctoral students  were in it . And Loretta Bailey, who was a playwright; other writers,  Prof. George McKie, Van Woodward and myself. That ' s ten, and I think  there were about a dozen of us, Prof . Carleton Beals, Rev. Donald Stewart.  And we had Jonathan Daniels come over from Raleigh; he was Editor of  Raleigh News and Observer and son of Josephus Daniels, Ambassador to Mexico  and Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of the Navy.  SG : How did Daniels come to talk to the group?  Stone: He came over to see what we were doing. Philips Russell was  a columnist in his paper and he was on alumnus of UNC himself. * I subscribed  to the Raleigh Times and Observer (it was the best paper in  North Carolina, published in Raleigh), and I would write them occasionally  to please not put the civil rights news [laughter] that blocks out each  other so I could clip it. And they were real sweet in responding that  they would try and keep that in mind.  So this group met periodically when something came up that we thought  was crucial that we needed to take action on. And we'd say here's the  * Daniels &amp; &#183; eb Powell roomed together at UNC when the latter was studying law  7  Arkansas sharecroppers case, and here are the extorted confessions used  in a trial, here is a strike-breaking goon and here is a lynching.  SG: What wasn't clear to me was the objectives. Because it seemed  to be that the objectives were more educational. In what way was it  action &#8226; &#8226; .  Stone: They were educational. They also had an advocacy role.  On the basis of exposes, carefully investigated, we urged that pressure  be brought to bear on government, industrialists, and landlords to correct  inequities or illegalities. The Bulletins carried names of editors and  sponsors, together with my Chapel Hill mailbox.  SG: That was my next question; why your name wasn't on there?  Stone: Why my name wasn't there? I don ~ t know; I really don't.  And I think at times I stayed too much in the background helping people.  I finally had it on the letterhead, you notice; I think I was then an  officer rather than the Executive Director, but I considered myself  Executive Director at the outset. Does that little blue mimeographed  smnmary call me that? It doesn't? &#183;  SG: I don't think that your name was in here either.  Stone: Oh yes, it's in there, I'm almost sure.  SG: Because I remember when I first looked at it  s.  Stone: [Looking at yearly report for/ C.P.R.] Well for heaven's  sakes, for some reason &#8226; Isn't that the limit? Good night~  SG: I was wondering why that &#8226;  Stone: Oh, that's entirely too modest, because this is a good job  I did! "Prepared by the Southern Committee for People's Rights at &#8226;  this is my box number. I had no funds whatsoever other than $1 dues t o  run this; it was my money and my volunteer time. But I was succeeded by  II &#8226;  '  I'  8  Betty Malcombre after I persuaded others to pitch in and she was paid  a small salary to do this . She did a better job on some things. Some  of the letters she wrote on our letterhead embarrassed me, because she  just didn't know the important people you had to be respectful towards.  SG: But really, although your name appeared nowhere, you were the  main impetus.  Stone: I was. And I kept it going, and kept on meeting. And people  turned to me when they needed to have a meeting, and we called a meeting.  But they did most of the writing. Actually, some of this was due to the  fact that I was awed by having all these Pulitzer Prize winners and other  famous writers, historians, journalists.  SG: Would you assign--topics?  Stone: Yes. We would agree on what should be chosen for publicising  or for proposed action . We had to be selective, because look what I put  in the 19-page summary &#8226; &#8226; how many things were happening all the time.  This is just for one year; well, it was almost two years, practically.  (Some of the things that I've stapled here did indicate some things that  had happened somewhat before. For instance, this is 1933 which was while  I was still in Alabama, you see, some of the laws that had been passed,  such as the .)  SG: There seems to have been a focus on academic freedom as well,  wasn't there?  Stone : Yes. Oh yes, definitely. Does this include the flogging of  Joseph Gelders?  SG: I don't think so.  Stone: I don't think it does. I think that followed. And I have  the account of that. And of Steelman's being beaten up in Tuscaloosa while  - -=-  9  investigating a lynching. He was my fellow professor at Montevallo,  you will recall, when Myra Callis came to visit me from Tuskegee Institute.  At any rate, Steelman later went on to be on the staff of Ma Perkins in  the Department of Labor, and I lost track of him. He got way up in the  scale. He too~ his students down to Tuscaloosa to do research on a  lynching. And they were flogged, attacked, and their papers were gone  through. And he had to go to the judge and get himself identified as a  professor at Montevallo. And he knew some professors at the University  of Alabama who came up and identified him. But still, he had such things  as the New Republic in his hand, and they thought that was a Communist  [laughter ] journal.  SG: So this was one of the causes that you then took on?  Stone: Well, I don't know that they &#8226; &#8226; . They didn't while I was  in Chapel Hill. Tiley may have later; But Joe Gelders meanwhile had  organized--he was a physicist, so he wasn't in the field of social science  that would presumably bring you a little closer to the problems. But  I've found that many social scientists are much more timid than the people  in the fine arts and humanities or in the physical sciences.  SG: And that was true with your group in Chapel Hill?  Stone: That seemed to have been true there, yes. As I say, Stanley  Stevens was a Doctoral student in sociology. He dropped out and didn't  ever take his Doctor's degree; he and one or two others were with me in  the Southern Committee. And people such as Vance and Johnson understood  and accepted it. Va.rice did.his "speaking out1"' as did Johilson,- through  forthright publications &amp; John~_on became- the ....1 st executive of .Southern Regional  Council. Both supported Alexander ' s interracial commission .  In fact, I think one of the problems in that transition period of  new in  the SCPR for those of us who were/ trying to understand Odum's approach--  10  and I came to admire him very much, and to appreciate the kind of leadership  that he gave in the community--is that many of his professors had been  his students, and had grown up in Chapel Hill. He later broadened his  faculty to have degrees from a larger number of other universities, but  at that critical time he needed people who could work on regionalism.  Odum was a man of many talents, you know. He has written books in  folk lore--you know, about that whole society&#183; that he wrote on and collected  folk tales and so forth. So that Guy Johnson went off in that direction  on anthropology and the Negro, and Vance went off in the direction of  agrarian problems . He wrote The Human Geography of the South and many  other books and articles in the agrarian field.  SG: Well, even though they weren't in the group, were there any  issues on which they would join with those of you who were in the  Committee for People's Rights? Or did they remain quite separate all the  time?  Stone : Well, we didn't ask them. All we did was, we put out this  publication and disseminated it. We mailed it to people, to the newspapers  and elsewhere . By the end of 1936 we had a mailing list of 1,000, and  circulated the Bulletin all over the universityt Each of us tried to do that  to some extent, but I don't think we had enough money to have a larger  mailing.  SG: So you didn't have subscribers to it then?  Stone: Yes, the Bulletin refers to $1 dues or subscription and there  was a collection of $1500. I don't recall where and how the printing was  handled.  13, 18 , 2?- 23  *See pages/ for clarification  11  SG: As you recall, the group of you would meet and decide what was  to be in each issue?  o r ~rrived at a consensus,  Stone: Yes, yes. We definitely voted on thatJ and divided up the  work that was to be done: who was interested in this? Such as Paul  Green may have written the article on the chaingang victims as his  secretary took down what we were saying that night. See, we ' d sometimes  put in "Support this," as an injunction to people : "Arkansas strikers  are terrorized." And the resolution.  SG: Now how would you decide? In other words, each of you was  comtinually gathering information. It wasn't division of functions, where  there was one person who would research things, and another person who  would do something else?  Stone: I was the clipping bureau, and kept a scapbook, later  mimeographed. But other people would bring matters to me. They would get  on the telephone line--and say, "Let's meet. It's awfully interesting  what's happening in Burlington. Or what's happening somewhere else; let's  talk that over." As I recall, we didn't have any regular meeting time or  place. I remember at one point we elected a young Presbyterian minister as  our chairman, Donald Stewart, and we met at his church. Otherwise I  don't recall where we met; I think at some university office or building,  because most of us were connected with the university in one way or another.  I don't know anybody living in Chapel Hill [laughter] who wasn't! It was  such a little town in those days. When I went back during World War II  from Washington giving consultations in North Carolina and Virginia, I  stopped there, and was astonished at how it had grown as a result of the  war, and how many temporary buildings had to be thrown up to take care of  all those soldiers and sailors who came there to study.  12  SG: So everyone in the group was connected with the university, then?  Stone: Most of those I remember had some connection with the  university, as wives or students or professors or ministers or bookstore  operators. And mostly they were professors. While I always kept my  student status and made that clear [laughter], I suspect that my being  older and more experienced may have added to the respect and trust I was  accorded.  SG: But it does sound like many of the women in the circle in which  you traveled, many of the wives even, were professionals themselves.  Stone: Yes. Yes, that's true. That's very true.  SG: What was the sex division in your group, in the Committee for  People's Rights? Do you recall how many women?  Stone: There were far more men than women. Loretta Bailey, who was  the wife of J. O. Bailey, was one of our ardent members.  SG: Did she have her own career?  or more  Stone: She was in the group of playwrights who published two;volumes  of Carolina folk plays. She was a gifted writer, but not a salaried  member of the English Department, as was her husband, J. O. Bailey.  SG: I see. But she was more than his wife?  Stone : She had her own career, yes. And she assumed one of the  jobs as editor of our Bulletin. She wrote some of the articles,helped  to organize it, and perhaps rewrote some items. But we got Prof. Geo.  McKie as chief editor, I was astonished that he had this much interest.  He was a very good friend of Lee Brooks, one of my professors. But Lee  never did come into this organization. I never invited him; he never  offered to come. I did not invite any of my professors; I thought it  would be up to them if they wanted to join. I now wonder : why didn't  13  I at least give them a chance? Say, "Do you know about this? You would  certainly be welcome, if you'd like to come." But I seem to have been  hesitant over having it mixed up with what I was doing in my course  assignments.  BEG IN SIDE II TAPE L  One of the problems we got into had to do with an anthropologist  named Ken Malcombre who was not connected with the university, but was  there on some research mission and who married Betty Winston the daughter  or granddaughter of either a former judge or governor of North Carolina.  Malcombre later became interested in radical causes, and I think joined  the Communist party. People were wary of him.  SG: What department was he in?  Stone : He was an anthropologist, and I don't know in what capacity  he was there.  I know that after I left there my friend Kate Way who was in this  group had some repercussions from Malcombre . She was a physicist and was  at Chapel Hill at the same time I was. She 's now a retired nuclear physicist,  editor of two of the journals with an office at Duke University.  SG: So there were these three women.  Stone : There were at least three women, and maybe more ; I 'm trying  to recall.  SG: Now, you started to tell a story about this anthropologist.  Stone: Yes. Kate told me that after she went to Oak Ridge and was  on the Manhatten Project in very sensitive work during the war, she was  with Condon in a federal bureau. Condon came under McCarthy attacks.  He was cleared; there was nothing, but you know how McCarthy was. And  Kate was interviewed with respect to Condon and asked about her Chapel  14  Hill associates and this organization.  SG: I see; the Committee for People's Rights?  Stone: The Committee for People's Rights; and also, any other  connections in Chapel Hill where Malcombre was an admitted Communist.  And she wrote me about the fact that they asked Malcombre if she had  been associated with him in Communist activity; and he said, "Oh no,  she's too frivolous for this kind of work." And Kate wrote me, "Saved  by frivolity!" [laughter] Can you imagine a nuclear physicist being frivolous,  you know? [laughter] But it was kind of amusing.  SG: _ Well, was he in the group, or just on the fringes?  Stone: His wife was associated with it; in fact it was she who was  my successor as executive secretary. He chaired the Burlington strike  case. We did not know (and wouldn't have cared) that he had become a  Communist; but then he qegan trying to recruit other people after which  nobody wanted to follow him any more.  SG: Now how public was the group?  Stone: Perfectly public. Because there was not anything at all to  hide. We were not associated with any political party as an organization-Socialist,  or Communist or &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; I guess there were plenty of people who  were either Democrats or Republicans, and no doubt quite a number were New  Dealers. I soon lost my feeling that the New Deal [laughter] wasn't  going fast enough; you see, I was impatient with Roosevelt to begin with.  SG: The major purpose of the group was, then, educational: to put  out the Bulletin and to inform people.  Stone: Yes . And hope thereby to promote civil rights. And that's  what most of the civil liberties programs were doing; they were gathering  information, disseminating the facts, and giving an opinion. We didn't  15  try to give every side of an issue. We would conclude a report on  violations for instance, with an injunction to readers "to bring unremitting  pressure to bear" on officers or legislators. Or we might urge  the support of progressive legislation or investigation of crimes, citing  such-and-such legislation in several places.  SG: Did you act as a consolidated group on issues: for instance,  in terms of lobbying for a specific thing? Or did you do it as individuals  who were part of the Committee?  Stone: The only time that specific action was taken beyond the  dissemination of this Bulletin and yearly summary, that I recall, was  when Professor Erickson of the English Department was assailed and threatened  with dismissal because he had lunch with a black man who was running for  office, who ran for vice-president on the Communist ticket.  SG: He was at Chapel Hill?  Stone: Ford was in Durham, Erickson in Chapel Hill, a Chaucerian  [laughter] and a very distinguished scholar. But he got interested in  civil rights. The letter reads: "Professor Erickson, with a group of  white and Negro guests, attended a private dinner and forum conference  given for James W. Ford following a speech at the Durham Courthouse made  by the Negro Communist candidate for vice-president."  SG: After you left, though, the Connnittee had continued?  Stone: Yes, it continued. And Mr. Stewart, Reverend Stewart, was  the chairman and first Betty Malcombre and then Minna Abernethy was  doing the secretarial work.  SG: But you said you really considered yourself the &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  Stone: The Executive Secretary, yes, earlier I accepted that role, and  I was behind the scenes from modesty on a lot of things. For instance, I  16  notice we wanted to reorganize the SCPR in Richmond (r:must have prepared  this letter, because I have several drafts [laughter]) I wrote: "For  Susan B. Lough (a teacher at Richmond University) and Mrs. Henry Decker,  Virginus Dabney (the editor of Richmond Times-Dispatch), Committee on  Continuation for Richmond, Southern Committee for People's Rights." And  it was telling about, "Several yearr. ago at a luncheon meeting in the  YWCA twenty-five Richmond men and women discussed the need of a constructive  program for promotion and preservation of civil rights in the South.  Representative professional people gathered there, gave warm approval of  a plan to cooperate with the other southern cities in effecting the  organization of what came to be known as the Southern Committee for People's  Rights. And then subsequently chapters were formed in other southern cities,  and individuals all over the South became members at large. A people's  rights bulletin published by the North Carolina group reached a circulation  of over a thousand."  SG: Oh. Well, that's interesting. So this refers to a meeting in  Richmond.  Stone : In the YWCA in Richmond. This revival of an earlier 1935  organization occurred after I was employed. The date of the letter is 1937.  SG : I see. So this is when you were attempting to organize up there?  Stone : No&amp;gt; to reorganize or reactivate the one I helped start in 1935  when I was invited up from Chapel Hill.  Not too long afterward Joe Gelders proposed consolidation with his  Birmingham defense organization. He wrote : "I notice that the Malcombres  are no longer in Chapel Hill, and with you gone we are wondering what is  happening with the Southern Committee for People ' s Rights. The main work  being done in the South along the lines corresponding to the program of  Ill  17  this Southern Committee is obviously the work we are doing in Birmingham  and the vicinity. With a little over a year's history behind us now  [that was defense of political prisoners] and with some very definite  achievements, we are wondering if the membership of the Southern Committee  for People's Rights would be willing to incorporate itself with our  Committee, strengthening our prestige and effectiveness and enabling us  to expand our work so as to be more Southwide in nature." And so I think  that was a good thing not to be called just "Defense of Political Prisoners,"  but have a broader focus.  SG: So he tried to take on the name, in other words?  Stone: Well, he asked permission to call it the National Committee,  and he wrote to Chapel Hill and to the Peninsula, which were the most  active chapters of the Southern Connnittee. And they didn't seem to object,  so he just called it the National Committee for People's Rights, instead  of the Southern Committee for People's Rights.  SG: And did those people then get involved in it?  Stone: I don't know. Now let's see the dates here. He went down  to see them in Chapel Hill. I didn't go with him there, but I did call  a group together for a luncheon meeting to introduce him. And Virginius  Dabney and Dr. Mitchell and all those fine people were at the luncheon at  which he spoke about his flogging in Birmingham and other problems. They  were most sympathetic and agreed that we should do something about it.  (Holding up statement): This was the follow-up with Lough, Dabney and the  others to sign; I drew it up for the~, so I was again acting as sort of an  Executive Secretary in getting something going in Richmond. (And I did  the same thing for the Conference on Marriage and the Family in Virginia.  I was the Executive Secretary to get a Groves--an Ernest R. Groves type  18  of conference--organized. Some people were very resistent to it; they  didn't like that. They'd rather just have a section on "Family" in the  Southern Sociological Association. I was president of the Virginia  Sociological Association in 1940 ).  SG: While you were at Chapel Hill, then, the focus was primarily  on getting out the Bulletin, and then on putting together an annual report.  Stone: Prior to the Bulletin and through it we urged pressure  through letters to elected officials on legislation, as I have t0ld you.  SG: The group didn't make any concerted effort as a group?  Stone : No. And it was after I left that they asked us to sign  names on a petition regarding Erickson.  SG: Did the group organize meetings around some of these subjects,  or did it meet as a closed group that primarily was working on the Bulletin?  Stone: Meetings ~ set up to discuss specific problems, but we  were not a closed group. I don ' t remember any large attendance but we  always had open meetings; people were welcome to come and sometimes we  had out-of town visitors, as I have mentioned.  SG: So you didn't actually organize programs?  Stone: We did have a loose organization, as I have said, with an  executive secretary and ad hoc investigative and action committees. Our  Bulletin's 4 issues carried an average of 8 cases or a total of 30 plus.  In addition to reporting the facts and urging action we offered to receive  and disperse additional information and guides to organizing local chapters.  Let me repeat that SCPR had formal officers and letterhead in both Va. and  N.C. after we could afford the cost of letterhead. The Bulletin's  printing came first but competing organizations constantly appeared.  In Richmond and Chapel Hill I received a flood of letters from all the  ....  19  interracial groups: the Negro Youth Group, the NAACP, the Civil Liberties  Union, the Southern Conference for Human Welfare and so on. And it wasn't  easy to separate things that said "race" that were mainly to help with  better race relations from "civil rights," because race relations always  involve that. How can you have true race relations when one group is not  given the ballot, or is in other ways a second-class citizen? My big  problem has always been having too many irons in the fire. I should have  said, "I'm going to stay with race and nothing else." Or "I'm going to  stay with farm workers and nothing else." I did try to close off the  industrial workers; I was not as interested in them and didn't know as  much. But along came Lucy Randolph Mason.  SG: But this was later, though, too.  Stone: Later; at William and Mary.  SG: Well, let's try and concentrate on &#8226;  Stone: On Chapel Hill.  SG: So the Chapel Hill group was the first group that was formed?  Stone: That's true.  SG: And how did you go about, then, getting this Peninsula group  formed, and then the other groups?  Stone: From correspondence with Ralph Bunc regarding a Howard  University Conference I conclude that I was invited to both Newport News  and Richmond before I left Chapel Hill or before I was offered a position  at William and Mary.  In Richmond, a Mrs. White who was Industrial Secretary at the YWCA  arranged a luncheon meeting. There was good attendance and interest but  if formal organization came about it had to be re-activated after my return  as a professor. The Peninsula Chapter was different. It was started by  20  a group of prominent professional people, such as a Superi~te~ae~t of Educaaion,  Hampton Institute administrators,. and others 'itivolved in a Pub1.ic Forum.  Among them was a relative of a former associate of mine whom I had known in  a nother&#183; capacity. , She probably vouched for me. Jess and Ber~  Jackson were from old Virginia families and they got an active chapter  going, with by-laws and letterhead. Apparently they were better fundraisers  than we were in Chapel Hill.  SG : But you never, for instance, would write to some of your other  contacts in the South at other schools suggesting that each one form a  branch also?  Stone : In the Deep South? Apparently without success beyond  individual memberships, a thousand in all. Atlanta was a likely place  with all its colleges and universities but in the absence of lost files, I  cannot reconstruct the extent of active participation or on-going interest.  SG : Well, even though the original meeting of the Southern League for  People's Rights, which sort of spawned the Committee, was in Atlanta &#8226;&#8226; &#8226;  Stone : That was in Atlanta, yes.  SG: There still was no follow-up.  Stone: No follow-up; partly because Vann and I left Georgia and Alabama  fairly soon after that. I was winding up a lot of things at Montgomery,  and trying to figure out, you know, what I was going to do. If we could  remember who called the meeting, we might find that the inaction was  centered there.  SG: Maybe it's because you did come from so many states that there  weren't that many people actually in the Atlanta area to have done that  sort of thing?  Stone: That's true. And while I have a notion at least a half-dozen  people were from the Atlanta area, I can only recall the two people, Vann  21  Woodward and Glenn Bainey, and Woodward has no recollection, he tells me  by long distance.  SG: Now, so the group remained basically a relatively self-contained  group, the Committee?  Stone: Yes, but apparently with a subscription list, a mailing list  of one thousand, as I have said. And who addressed all those envelopes?  If it was not Olive Stone, I don't know [laughter]. I don't think we  had Addressographs in those days. It looks as if I was kept busy with  the handmaiden's things. Well, not exactly, because I 'm sure I didn't  hesitate to seek out help &#8226; I've never been timid about that.  SG: Why does there seem to be this pattern, though, of your staying  more in the background?  Stone: And pushing other people forward? A feeling &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; Well, I  didn't feel I had the distinction or that I was known as well. For  instance, these people who had published &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; Why I haven't done more  publishing is ridiculous, because I've been invited to submit talks or  term papers but wanted to rework or improve them and somehow failed to  satisfy my own expectations or went on to explore something else. I'm  forever trying to perfect something before sending it off. And it's  best to send it, and risk getting it rejected, and rewrite it and send it  again, and so on. I just didn't do that. Occasionally a journal put  pressure and I delivered. I do have publications in social work,  anthropology, history, psychology, but little or nothing in sociology.  SG: But since you hadn't published you saw the other people as &#8226;  Stone: As distinguished people, .and their names would mean more.  Also the others were professionals, and I was a graduate student. So who  would have the nerve, you know, to say that I'll be the president of this,  22  or anything of the kind.  SG: But since you were the executive secretary and the one who  organized it  Stone: Yes, they accepted me apparently.  SG: And the fact that you were a student did not  Stone: Didn't matter there, no. In fact about a third of our Chapel  Hill members were Doctoral students in History, English, Sociology, Physics,  and other fields and this was a weakness in that we scattered to our  positions upon graduation. Vann Woodward went to Florida, Arnold Williams  to Michigan etc. I was not shy within the university in several departments.  For example, I enjoyed very much going to this very creative drama group.  They would stage a premier of a Paul Green play that went on to Broadway;  or they'd do these folk plays, and criticize each other, the writing and  acting, afterwards. I went to all of those, and I had more fun with  the English Department than I often did with the Sociology Department  except for a few of the more creative sociologists  SG: So it seems that most of your social and political ties were  to people outside of your own department.  Stone : Outside of the department, that's true. Academically I  was thoroughly congenial and at home. Only later did I come f'ully to  appreciate the political approach that Odum had.  SG: I wanted you to go into that more, because you've alluded  several times to your not wanting to offend him, and being somewhat cautious.  Could you detail for me what you saw as the differences, and how you  gradually changed your attitude?  Stone: Yes . He was a very good friend of Will Alexander. And at  this point, in the early period, I felt that the people in Will Alexander's  23  group were overly cautious, working only through traditional channels.  Actually, I came to realize you've got to work through the church and other  traditional institutions [laughter] in the South, you know. As I've  said before, it is important in the South to be southern, and there is an  added bonus in having religious backing. Now, you've been reading about  the South. Notice that several people say that until the South can get  out of its fundamentalist religious frame it will never get anywhere. On  the other hand, the most radical work has always been done through the  liberal church in the South. And the phrases that you read from McNeil  Poteat, the Baptist preacher, or from Kirby Page, the one who writes  about peace (he was a minister), and Reinhold Niebuhr, who was with the  seminary where Myles Horton went: they talk about "radical religion."  They use terms like that: radical Christianity. Howard Kester, particularly ,  was saying that the Fellowship of Reconciliation had split into two groups.  One consisted of those that were willing to have a broader front (as  Lucy Randolph Mason was, too), that would even include Communists and  Socialists, but would try to keep them from trying to take over the cause. &#183;  Well, it didn't always work. At any rate, one group tried. Then others  said: anybody but the Communists. They inclined towards the socialist  viewpoint, which was sort of my general outlook though I always call  myself a Democrat. I voted for Norman Thomas once.  SG: So you saw Odum and the tie to Will Alexander and the church as  being more conservative?  Stone: A more conservative group and more cautious approach. And i n my  24  impatience I thought we could go faster. I found we couldn't, and later  I thought they were right. When I look back at the organization of the  Southern Regional Council, I notice the whites had to be prodded by the  black's Durham statement before preparing their own Atlanta statement in  response six months later. Finally a joint statement of objectives was  signed in Richmond. Presumably ~here was agreement on style &amp;&#183; pace &amp; on  avoiding terms, such as class struggle, used by Bunche, e.g. in his early research.  He did his doctoral dissertation, I believe at Yale, on the Negro  elite of Africa.  SG: But there seemed to be something else in some of your other  tapes towards Odum and the regional sociology that you felt was at odds  with what you were doing, and your interests.  Stone: No, not with regional sociology itself. My own State of  Alabama convened a conference of teachers to incorporate regional concepts.  I have it here. Perhaps the critics thought it was not transferrable to  other parts of the nation. But I believed in starting in the South and  working there first, so that was not in discord with my feeling. And I  think the regional approach was a positive and constructive substitute for  sectionalism. I found in some of my research (in fact, other people did  too) that the Eastern seaboard North and South had a lot more in common  than East and West. For example in dialect, that the people in Charleston,  South Carolina spoke more like the Bostonians than they did like people  further west in the South or in the North.  No, I had no objection to the regional approach. I think I had  objection to the fact that Odum wanted to go slow. I guess people just  assumed that he wouldn't want to join an organization of our kind, that  he would want to decide and would become the leader in his own time--and  25  he did, in the Southern Regional Council.  SG: Well, was there also some fear of stepping on his toes, in the  sense that he viewed himself as being in a leadership role. And then for  a group of people in his same &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; actually at his school, even, to set  up something; was that viewed as &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; ?  Stone: Yes he did want to be or to choose the leader, but I  wonder now why I didn ' t say, "Dr. Odum, I'd like your advice on this.  What do you think would be &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; ?" I think perhaps my hesi tancy in asking  this is that he might have said, "Don't do it." And I didn't feel I  could give it up; I thought that I had accepted this responsibility to  friends in Alabama to whom I'd said, "I 'm leaving in order to do this civil  rights work." And I did feel dedicated to it.  SG : Why do you think he would have said that?  Stone : I think he was a cautious man in some ways. And also, he  believed in scientific research. You know he had two doctor'&#183;s degrees, one  in psychology and one in sociology. A brilliant man. And he studied Greek  and Latin; his first professorships were in teaching Greek and Latin. Can  you imagine? And he went off' to Clark and took a doctorate in psychology.  And he decided he needed to know something about sociology, so he swtiched  over to Columbia and took another Ph.D.  SG: Well in other words, he would have thought that his student &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  Stone: He came to like some things of mine. For instance, he quotes  me in &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; The one thing that people were always criticizing him about  is, he wrote a small pamphlet claiming that the Negro was inherently  inferior to the white: didn't have the intelligence of the white person.  It was based upon such anthropological information as was available. He  never tried to act defensive about this. He was constantly attacked by  &#8226; 26  inter-racial groups for that one little publication. And when I was doing  a term paper for him one time I made the notation, that at the time when  this publication was brought out anthropology was way behind in providing  the data that disproved this. It was written before World War I when as  you know, early I.Q. tests showed that the Southern whites were behind  the Northern blacks in the results. As inadequate as the IQ tests were  at that time, they still could show some regional differences. But I was  pointing out the timing of this; and he was eternally grateful that I  had said it. And in a later book he quoted me [laughter], you see, as  having pointed this out; so that he didn't have to be defensive, but he  could cite my research for this. So from this and other shared opinions  we got to be real good friends. And as a board member of the Forum I  got him and Vance on the program.. He came t o Richmond &amp;spoke on regionalism.  SG: Did he ever in any way comment on the Committee or the bulletin?  Stone: Not that I ever heard him do. But we did come to be very  good friends, as I say. When Harriet Herring got up a fund to have a  portrait painted of him I gladly joined in the group that raised money for  that portrait. And a scholarship &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; they've established a Howard Odum  scholarship. Then I later, sent a check to the Sociology Department  saying I'd like to contribute it to the Howard Odum Fund in honor of  five of my professors who retired (Rupert Vance, Guy Johnson, Harriet  Herring, Katharine Jocher, and Lee Brooks.)
