Myron McLaren: What do you want to know? You want to know about her family and so on? Mary Frederickson: First of all, I wanted to know about her family. She was born in Pennsylvania, wasn't she? McLaren: Well, one of the most astonishing things about her is that she's related to Winston Churchill. I don't know exactly how. Never did find out and she wasn't very much interested. But her father's name was Churchill, I mean his first name. No, not his first name. Yeah, Fred Churchill Leonard. And his son, my wife's brother, his name was Churchill. Walter Churchill Leonard. And then there's Walter's son, who lives up in New Hampshire and his name is Churchill. His name IS Churchill. Churchill Leonard. And somehow or another they're related to the Churchills of England. M.F.: What did Mr Leonard do for a living? McLaren: Mr Leonard? He was a 19th century, small town, what shall I say? His father was a farmer. He carried on mostly at Cotter's Fork, Pennsylvania. [Cowter's Fork.] It was named after a man named Couder, I suppose a Frenchman. M.F.i Is that where she grew up? McLaren: That's where she grew up. She was born in Weldsborough, which is 25 or 30 miles farther east toward New York. Mr Leonard went to Yale. Her father. And got a law degree there. He was a lawyer and he  page 2 'V was head over heels in all kind of businesses. Electric railroads, mining, lumbering, farms. Not farms that he worked but farms that he bought. M.F.: He managed all these businesses or invested. . . . McLaren: Buy farms and sell them. And he was a banker. He was president of a bank. And he was in the United States Congress for one term. But the politicians. . . you know how they traded things. They put him in there for an interval. And then one of the big shots who was instrumental in putting him in wanted the job himself. M.F.: What party did he go in on? What ticket? McLaren: Republican. So they got him a job as United States Marshall and they lived in Harrisburg for some time. But generally speaking, he was a rather typical type of person. He was a very fine person, I think, although I never saw him. But I know from some letters that I read and I know from his children the kind of family that they were. . . that he must have been a fine human being. M.F.: What about her mother? What was she like? McLaren: The mother is also a fine person but with a very different background. Her father, ... I know nothing about her mother. Or whether she had a mother. After the war. Her father was in the war. M.F.: This is WWI. McLaren: No, no, in the Civil War and so forth. War Between the States. And he was taken prisoner and he was in Andersonville for a long time and he nearly died there of starvation. And he never was able to get back on his feet after. And she. . . . You see, I'm leaving out the mother because I don't know a thing about her. Whether the mother was dead at that time or died shortly after he came out of the service, out of prison, I don't know. But anyway, she was in an orphan school or orphan's home at I page 3 Mansfield, Pa. I think there was another sister. And she became a teacher in the public schools. And Mr Leonard met her when she was teaching. They were married and he started practicing law in Weldsborough in a law firm. WeIdsborough's a much larger town, of course. WeIdsborough's a place of, oh, I don't know, at that time it was probably 25 or 30,000. Whereas Cowter's Fork's about. . . today it's about five or six thousand, maybe. Maybe four thousand. I don't know. Not large. M.F.: Was she their oldest child? McLaren: She was the oldest. There were three girls and one boy. All the girls went to Vassar. And then Louise, my wife. ... I think after she became interested in. . . maybe after she'd started the summer school. I don't know, not sure about it. She went to Columbia and got a master's degree in economics. She studied with Tugwell and others. She went there primarily to work with Tugwell. After she got out of college. . . we're going back now, . . she taught in Watertown, New York. I think in the normal school. Something that always amused her and me was she taught logic. M.F.: You didn't think she was logical? McLarenY Yes, I thought she was logical, but she never had had any course in logic. *     M.F.: How long did she teach? McLaren: Well, she went from there, . . I don't know how long she was at Watertown. She went to Lockhaven, where there's a state normal school. Lockhaven, Pa. It's on one of the big rivers, I don't know exactly, out in central Pennslyvania. And she was dean of women there and taught history. I think that from there she came to New York. She was in this building. She was the national secretary in the YWGA in what was then page 4 called the industrial department. I don't know whether they have it anymore. It's not very popular among the business people nowadays. And somehow or another her association with the Y and her work in the Y took her to the South. And she had offices in Baltimore. She worked out of Baltimore but spent a lot of time in the southern states. She was supposed to. That was her assignment. Let's say this. That she came from what snootily we can call an aristocratic background as far as her father and the Leonards were concerned. But they were very democratic people. He was a Bull Mooser. That's when he went into Congress. Supported Roosevelt and supported by the political machine out there. And Roosevelt petered out and he petered out as a Congressman because the other fellow wanted the job. But she started out in life in a very different way. Democratic always but with no profound understanding of the society in which we live, which she acquired later. And she began acquiring it in a big way when she went into the southern mill towns and became acquainted with the workers who came to the Y. You know, some of them. And then she traced them, or went with them so to speak, from the Y into their actual home conditions and the factory conditions. We're now in the depression, She was there before the depression but the depression came along and things were hell not only there but everywhere. And it was then that she and I think Lois MacDonaldalthough I'm not sure about that. . . Lois was from. . . I don't think from Charleston. Some other town in South Carolina. M.F.: Winsboro. McLaren: Winsboro? Yeah, that's right. And did you ever hear anything about Ruth Scandry. Well, I think that Ruth Scandry [Scandruth?] I may be fuzzy on some of these things. I think that Ruth Scandruth and page 5 Lois MacDonald taught. . . there's an Agnas Scott College down there, isn't there? I think they taught there, both of them. I think that Ruth Scandruth had something to do. . . I mean she went along with the idea. But I think it was Louise, my wife, and Lois MacDonald who were the prime movers in getting the school started. I'm sure that Louise at that time had no connection with unions. But she was a person who. . . if she saw something had to be done, she'd go and do it. So she went right to the unions and talked to them about organizing a school. And they liked the idea. There was no workers education at that time of this kind. And the primary purpose of it at that time. ... It was really a great thing, I think, now. The school was criticized then and still is by those who remember, both from the right and from the left. The right, of course, thought it was too radical and the left thought it wasn't radical enough, And as I look back at it and think of her good judgment and the situation that existed in the country and what was needed, I think it was just right, What was needed then was organization of the workers. Roosevelt was in office and he was backing the CIO and the whole idea of labor organization. And the job to do at that time was to organize. To get the workers organized. And in order to get them organized, from her point of view and from the point of view of the good labor leaders, it was necessary to teach the workers something about unions. M.F.: Did the Y, as far as you know, support her work with the school when she first started it? The industrial department. McLaren: No, the YWCA was not in it at all. She left the Y entirely. M.F.: Why did she leave it? McLaren: What I mean is, she gave up her YWCA job. She had no hard feelings about the Y ever. She had very good friends in the Y. You know page 6 Eleanor Anderson? She's a wonderful person. Have you met her? M.F.: I'm going to meet her tomorrow. McLaren: Oh, you are? She's a wonderful person, M.F.: She stayed in the Y, I believe. All I was asking was if she felt that the Y was no longer. . . that the industrial department just couldn't do enough. McLaren: At that time? Well, I couldn't answer that, but my opinion would be that she did think that it wasn't the answer, that it didn't go far enough. Well, it wasn't an educational thing. And in order to educate, as she wanted to educate, you had to get the girlsit was girls at that time. It later became co-educationalyou had to get them out of the factories into a school with teachers and a program and teach. And again I say, it was good. It was no time for going farther to the left. And furthermore, at that time, she wasn't prepared to go farther to the left, intellectually. I was. But I wasn't in the school. M.F.: When did you meet her? McLaren: I met her in 1930, I think. Maybe '29. Anyway, we were married in 1930. I was teaching at St John's College in Annapolis and she was in Baltimore then, had the offices there of the summer school at that time. Not the Y office. That was out. And I know nothing about that. Where it was or even when it was. It was before she went into the summer school. Anyway, her life was that of a teacher and organizer. She was really. . . Eleanor Anderson will tell you. . . she was a great executive. M.F.: She was very meticulous and organized. I told you I had read all the minutes that she kept of meetings of the school, of the. . . McLaren: Well, she was a good executive. She worked beautifully with page 7 people. She made some awful mistakes at times. Kind of mistakes that we all should make. She had great confidence in people, loved people and trusted them. And it's better to err on that side than it is on the other. M.F.: Who were her greatest supporters, would you say? Who were her best friends in the years of the summer school? Who were its longest supporters and defenders? McLaren: Oh, the unions. I have some letters here, if you would be interested in them, that were written. . . some of them union people, union organizers and union officers, at the time when she was applying for a job with the CIO political action committee. After she left the summer school. She got a job. . . I think it was immediately after that that she got the job. That was in the last campaign for Roosevelt. The CIO organized it and called it the political action committee. It still exists. PAG. In every campaign they take some kind of position, but they cannot use union money. They have to raise it. They can raise it from the workers or from anybody else. And they can get their support only that way, through a committee. Not through the union as such. That's illegal. M.F.: So she was working for them? McLaren: She worked for them during the last Roosevelt campaign. And in order to work for them she had to get the job. I have some letters that I think are very interesting. They reveal the kind of person she was. You can have them if you want. Her immediate supervisor was Vita Barnes, who by the way was a Mormon from Utah, M.F.: How long did she work with them? Just through the campaign? McLaren: All during the campaign. That's all it was supposed to be, M.F.: And then what did she do after that? McLaren: She was with the New York City Cancer Committee for a long page 8 time. And then she was with the Girl Scouts on a personnel job. M.F.: What did she do for the Cancer Committee? What kind of work? McLaren: She made use of her knowledge of unions and so forth. You see, they put out a lot of literature and so forth about cancer. And her job, as I understood it, was to keep in touch with the unions and get the literature distributed at the union offices and so forth and so forth. From her point of view, of course, it was no such job or that she could love as much as she. . . . She never loved anything as muchexcept meas she did the summer school. M.F.: What happened in 1943? They decided to move the offices South? McLaren: I don't know exactly what happened. There was a Brownie Lee Jones, who was a very fine person, and who had made up her mind that she. . . . She had been travelling a good deal of her life and kept. . . running the school was a very difficult job. It ran on a very small budget and she had to raise the money and run the school. Do the whole thing. All she had was a secretary, no other help except volunteer help. Then she had to travel a lot. And she became pretty weary of travelling. That was the reason she gave. I'm never too sure. M.F.: Someone said in a letter that I read at one point that it was her health. McLaren: No, no. She lived to be 83 years old and was in good health until she was about 80, even 81. We moved from Manhattan out to Queens when she was 80 years old. M.F.: You had been in New York for a very long time. . . McLaren: And I thought she was going to live. ... I don't know whether you know it yet, but you will as you get older. If you happen to be in good health, especially, you think you're going to live forever. And page 9 I thought she was going to live to be, . . . I had it all arranged that she was going to live to be 87, 88. M.F.: She died very suddenly? McLaren: No, no. She didn't die very suddenly. She was sick for a year and a half. I took care of her, with help from nurses. She just gave out, that's all. A lot of people do. She worked very hard, very hard, all her life. I don't think she worked very hard out in Gowter's Port, when she was a girl. M.F.: She made up for it. . . McLaren: I know she never worked        these mill workers work. I mean not when she was a girl. M.F.: You explained it, I think. And I think I understand it, but she had an extremely fierce dedication to the South. McLaren: It wasn't the South as such, whatever that means. It was just human beings. She happened to be there in this Y work and she happened to meet these girls, slaving their lives out in the factories. I've just been rereading this wonderful thing I have here, I Am A Woman Worker. And the one thing that hits me with the biggest impactwell, many things strike me, of coursebut the one thing that strikes me is that nobody on earth, no human beings on earth should have the power over other human beings that these bosses have over those girls. It just shouldn't be. And of course, because of the unions, it is not that bad now. It's much better. But it's bad enough yet. I drove a cab in this city for 20 years and I know something about it myself, although it's a somewhat different thing. I just quit last year. M.F.: Did you enjoy doing that? McLaren: Yeah. It's one of the most interesting jobs in the world if page 10 you can afford to do it. M.F.: You mean wear and tear on yourself? McLaren: The wear and tear on yourself is pretty great, but. . . if you're a certain kind of person, some people don't like it. But most of them, especially old timers, you can't pry them out of it. They like it. They don't make much money, but they have a good time. M.F.: Did you have your own cab? McLaren: No. I didn't start until I was 60 years old.. I'm 82 now. Mrs McLaren was older than I am. Six and a half years. M.F.: I talked to Polly Robkin on Saturday and she said to give you her greetings. McLaren: She's a very dear friend. I've talked with her since. I was trying to find out where you were and you'd been there. I didn't know that. M.F.: It was very interesting, because she was there as a student in the summer school. McLaren: To go back to Mrs McLaren's work. She worked for the Girl Scouts for two or three years. She wouldn't talk too much about these things, but I know what happened. It wasn't what she liked. She was dealing with girls, they were middle class girls. And she had been dealing with workers. And she had come to associate herself with the workers, the working girls and working men. Because in the last years of the school the men came there, too. And all the things that go on in the Girl Scouts couldn't interest her as much as the world of the workers. I've forgotten exactly how it happened, but she left. She thought she was going to retire. That was her reason for leaving. And she was old enough. She was 67 when she left the Girl Scouts. And not too long after that it was possible for her to page 11 get a part time job three or four days a week with the ALES, the director of which I think you have met, Eleanor Goit. The American Labor Education Service. And she was with them then until it closed. Two, three or four years. Working part time. And she loved that because she was back in what she liked. M.F.: In workers education. McLaren: Even that wasn't tops. Tops was the school, where the girls were there, where she saw them, associated with them. M.F.: Did she ever say anything about the change. . . during the war they had to stop having the residence school, as I understand it, because workers couldn't come for that long. McLaren: No, no. That wasn't the reason at all. It went on during the war, right along. M.F.: I thought they just shortened the session because people couldn't. . . McLaren: No, they didn't shorten the session as far as I know. M.F.: Why did they stop having the residence school? It turned into sort of a field operation. McLaren: Yes. There you've got me. I don't know why they did that. That was after she left, when Brownie. . . it didn't last too long. It didn't work. It didn't work. M.F.: Did she feel, when she left. ... I mean the school lasted, as workers education schools go, for a very long time. Did she feel that it had been a success? McLaren: I'm afraid I don't know for sure. She was that kind of person. She had made up her mind to stop. And she stopped. And got this CIO job, which at the time interested her greatly and always did interest her. Even after she was out of it. She had to be out of it because the campaign was over. That was all it was for, was for the campaign. To elect page 12 Roosevelt. M.F.: Did she ever consider going with the CIO on the organizing end in the South? McLaren: I don't know what happened there, either. All I know is that she got a job with the Cancer Committee not long after this other job stopped. And then largely through Eleanor Anderson she got the job with the Girl Scouts, which she liked better than the Cancer. ... No, she didn't like it better. She liked the cancer job better because she was still in touch with the unions. But when she went with the Girls Scouts that was all gone. M.F.: What about the unions during this. . . certainly when she first started the school, the unions were not at all enthusiastic about taking women as members. McLaren: Oh yes. M.F.: They were? McLaren: Oh yes. The textile workers. The union was working in the South, trying to organize them. And this was part of the organizing campaign, which lasted for years and should be going on now. M.F.: Still is, to a certain extent, I think. McLaren: Very much needed now. M.F.: But there wasn't any problem with women "becoming members of the union? McLaren: They wouldn't have any union if it hadn't been for the women because the women did the work. Some men, but they didn't amount to much. They mended the machines and things like that, mechanics. But the girls operated the machines. And the cigarette factories, the tobacco factories. Girls. Almost all girls. M.F.: So that was why the school was just for women in the beginning. page 13 Because that was where the need was to organize. McLaren: That's right. That's what I think and that's what she thought at the time. She was right, in my opinion. Even if one had been, you know, far left in one's thought, at that time you could not run that kind of school. . . well, you couldn't do the job that needed doing at that time, if you go in there trying to bring the workers over to socialism or something like that. You couldn't do it. You can't do it now, for that matter. But you could run a school of that kind now. But it wouldn't be the kind of school that was needed then. There was one at. . . Tennessee. 7 What was the name of it? Miles Horton was head of it. Highlander. That was doing more of that kind of thing. But they didn't even purport to be doing the same kind of job. They were doing a different kind of job. They could take risks that this school couldn't take. In other words, you had to work with the unions and with the union people. And work with people who were trying to organize the workers. And you couldn't organize the workers by getting up on a soap box and preaching socialism. M.F.: There were people in the school on her staff who were active in the socialist party. McLaren: No, I don't think any of them. No. I don't think that a one of them was. There, may have been some that I didn't know much of any-  i thing about. Hollis Ransdale. I think her husband was some kind of socialist, but he didn't have anything at all to do with the school. He was a carpenter and a very fine person. He was a Dane, from Denmark. Died rather young. But he had nothing at all to do with the school. Was never there. And she was not a socialist. Her first husband was a labor organizer during the war. Ross. I don't know much about him but I don't think he was a socialist. And Lois MacDonald was never a socialist. page 14 M.F.: I was going through the Frank Graham and he and your wife had a correspondence. . . McLaren: They were very good friends. Dr Graham and my wife. All of us. He was very enthusiastic about the school. He used to come I think almost every summer for a short visit. M.F.: In their correspondence, several times she wrote to him and asked . . . when the school was attacked as being a communist organization, she would write to him and ask him for advice as to how to handle it. McLaren: Did she write to him about some such thing? I didn't know it. M.F.: There were several articles occasionally when they would meet.  . . I think one time when they were meeting in Asheville there was an article in the paper about how there was a communist school meeting in Asheville. And she wrote and asked him how to counterattack and things like that. McLaren: Oh, this I think happened, but I'm not sure about it. You can't run a thing like that anywhere, a school like that, unless/and let certain people come in to it who are on the left. And they are likely to form some kind of group or caucus and even try to take over the school. I have reason to believe that there was a group. I don't know exactly who they were. Who tried that. But they didn't succeed.// And the reason was there was a man. . . whose name I wont mention for one reason because I can't. I've forgotten his name. But he was a very fine, very intelligent Jewish person from New York and I think he was a communist. But he was a CIO organizer and he knew what to do and what not to do. He knew he wasn't going to establish communism over night. I think it was he who smashed this thing in the school. If it was there at all. I'm not sure it was. n M.F.: He smashed it? McLaren: Yeah. He wouldn't go along with it. And if he didn't go  page 15 along with them they couldn't get anywhere. Because he had the power in the South. M.F.: Was it Leo Hubberman? McLaren: No, not Hubberman. Hubberman, he never taught at the school. Hubberman was, I suppose, let's say a right wing socialist, M.F.: I think it's very important to have some understanding of the political. . . . McLaren: Actually, this school was run without political. . , M.F.: No, I mean just because of the times, the '20s and the '30s, political parties were very active in the organizing in the South. Wouldn't you say that was all part of what was behind. . . . McLaren: That all came in to it, I'm sure. But the school as such took no political position. No student was. ... I didn't attend the classes. I wasn't there some of the time. No student was prevented from expressing an opinion, if they had any. Most of them didn't have any such opinions. They were foreign to them, absolutely foreign to them. They had all they could do to make enough to eat. And they never heard of socialism and they didn't hear about it much in the school, except maybe from some other person who knew something about it. But not from the faculty. M.F.: The economics that the faculty was trying to teach, what was it like? What was the program that they were. . . . McLaren: I was never in the economics class, taught by Lois MacDonald who taught labor problems in the economics department here at New York University. And she had a very good knowledge, academic knowledge of the labor movement. M.F.: A lot of labor history, from what I can understand. McLaren: She knew labor history and she knew the labor problems. She page 16 knew what was going on in the organizing field. And it was that kind of thing that the school existed for. Not to make socialists or communists, but to help these workers better their conditions. That was the immediate problem. Some of them were starving. Around 1930 and '31. They were literally starving. M.F.: For several years almost everyone who came was unemployed. McLaren: That's right. A lot of them were. But generally speaking, the students were sent there by the unions. M.F.: Did she continue having contacts with the YWCA as far as you know? McLaren: No, no. They had some kind of life membership or something that she always had. M.F.: But as far as recruiting students. . . . McLaren: No, the Y didn't have anything to do with it. The Y, even at that time, except through her and a few other people who were like-minded, didn't do much about the actual working conditions of the girls, as far as I know. And that, I suppose, is why she went off on this tangent, you can call it, and organized the school. To get at their real problems, which were bread and butter problems primarily. M.F.: She and Eleanor Colt, what was their relationship? McLaren: I don't know where she met Eleanor Goit, but they were life long friends. Well, maybe it's not life long. But somewhere when she was around New York. Eleanor Goit, I think, was born in New Jersey. I'm not sure, but I think so. M.F.: She was still working for Eleanor Colt when she was with ALES? McLaren: Yes, she was with Eleanor Goit at that time. Eleanor Goit, you talk with her. She had a very high regard for Louise, liked her very page 17 much, I brought this along. This is the best picture I have of her and it's not very good. You know                                  ? You know, out here on 5th Avenue sometimesit used to be much more, I haven't seen it for a long timeused to be people with cameras. And they'd snap your picture as you were walking along the street and then they'd sell them to you. And here was one of the finest supporters of the school. She was killed in an accident in Nairobi. In a bus accident. Pearl Willen. Do you know about her? That's Pearl and this is my wife. It was on 5th Avenue around 50th Street. And I don't think they were smiling about the photographer. They didn't know that the picture was being. . . . something they were talking about. And that's probably why he took the picture. M.F.: Pearl Willen raised money in New York for the school, didn't she? McLaren: Yeah, yeah. She was a very active person. Here's a picture of the school, one of the sessions. I don't think I was at this. Doesn't click. Maybe before we were married. See, she was running the school when we were married and before. M.F.: I have never seen this one. Burnsville in '28 or '29. McLaren: Oh, Burnsville, yes. That's when the terrible strike was going on in Marion. M.F.: Right. And they were involved in that a little. McLaren: Yes. They went there. I think they went on picket lines. Several people were killed in that strike. Six, seven of them. M.F.: I wondered if you worried a lot about her traveling in the South during this time. McLaren: Well, we weren't married until after that. It was going on. I remember attending meetings in Baltimore, raising money for the strikers. But I think by the time the next session of the school opened that that page 18 strike was over. And there was never anything like it after that. That was vicious. I was reading something in here about this written by a girl, undoubtedly a Southern Summer School girl. It was a German who was the owner of that factory. And while the strike was going on he arranged for a big meeting with the workers, the idea being that he was going to do something for them. What he did for them was to tell them that they were a bunch of animals and that the first thing they needed was a boss and if the boss didn't work they needed a master. And that's when things got hot. After that. Up on a platform, telling them. M.F.: Is there part of his speech or just an account. . .? McLaren: Somebody tells what he said. The girl's name is not on the thing. The girls' names don't appear on any of these. They had reason. They wanted jobs. M.F.: Was it hard for a girl to get a job after she had come to this school because she had been at the school? McLaren: Depends on what kind of factories they worked in. Bosses are not all alike, you know. M.F.: Polly Robkin said her boss had no idea what type of thing it was. You know, anything about it. McLaren: And some just didn't know. And as long as things went well, they didn't care. M.F.: Were you later involved in some of the organizing yourself? McLaren: No, only in the taxi outfit M.F.: One of the scrapbooks had in the back everyone's union affiliation. And they had that you McLaren: Well, I was in the American Federation of Teachers at that time. page 19 M.F.: That's right. That's what they had. Were you active in that? McLaren: No. I wasn't teaching, you see, when I joined that union. I got in to it because I had been a teacher. As a matter of fact we used to have. . . I've even forgotten the name. I think this thing in the scrap-book is wrong. I don't think I was ever in the American Federation of Teachers. We had two unions here, of teachers in New York City. One of them was more progressive than the other. M.F.: These were all university teachers? McLaren: No, most of them weren't as a matter of fact. High school. I think some were university people. And I was in the one that was more progressive. Did you ever know anything about Bella Dodd? Well, she was a communist and she became president of this teachers union that I was in. She was Italian. Dodd was her married name. And it was a great union. It fought hard for teachers. I don't know what happened. It's in the past. That union petered out and the membership went over into the American Federation of Teachers. I don't think I was in the American Federation. Maybe I was, but I don't think so. I think I was in that other union. M.F.: Where was Bella Dodd a teacher? McLaren: At Hunter college. She was a college professor. M.F.: Did you ever know Mary Barker? McLaren: Mary Barker is a very important person in this school. She was one of the prime backers of it. M.F.: She was chairman of the board for a long time. McLaren: Yeah. I don't know whether she helped organize it, but she. . . somewhere along the line, not long after it came into existence or maybe before. M.F.: She was in the American Federation of Teachers. McLaren: She was president of it, I think, for a while. Quite a while. page 20 She was an absolutely democratic minded person. And she loved the school. She came there every summer. And if there had been any teaching of communism in the classes, she would have known it. She probably wouldn't have said anything about it, but you would have heard about it. M.F.: I went through some of her correspondence and she was very anti-communist. There were several letters where she was attacking attacking is too strong a word McLaren: I never thought she was terribly anti-communist.  She claimed to be 100 percent for freedom of speech and all that kind of thing. M.F.: What about the relationship between communists and socialists during that time? McLaren: At that time? Well, it wasn't good. I mean they didn't get along very well. M.F.: Even after the United Front? McLaren: I'm pretty vague on all these things now. Those were the days of Norman Thomas and the socialist party, I think. Long after the days of Debs. M.F.: I was thinking of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. . . . McLaren: Oh, that union was interested in the school and used to send students there. But I don't think they were communist. M.F.: No, they were socialists and were always very upset about any. . . I mean they tended to be very anti-communist, as I can understand it. McLaren: Never paid much attention to what they were. The main point I'm trying to make [End of side of tape.] M.F.: Did the school maintain affiliations with the right as far as their affiliations with the AFL unions. . . with unions that tended to be more conservative, that were more to the right. page 21 McLaren: Oh, they had affiliations with a lot of unions that were very conservative. The barbers' union for example. One of the school's best supporters was the president of the barbers' union. Birthright. He was a nice guy, too. From Tennessee, wasn't he? M.F.: Right. He was head of the Tennessee Federation of Labor. Did you know Elizabeth Gilman? McLaren: Oh yes. That's where I met Louise. She used to have soirees every week. And I was teaching in Annapolis and I heard about it. I didn't know who she was. I mean not until I went down there. I don't know how I found out about Elizabeth, but I found out, someway. M.F.: She was a supporter of the school for a long time, wasn't she? McLaren: Yes. And I went to her home. She was a socialist, a Norman Thomas socialist and ran for governor. Oh yes, ran for governor of Maryland on a socialist ticket. Her father was president of Johns Hopkins University. And Elizabeth was a socialist. M.F.: A socialist in her position during that period, would they tend to be anti-communist or would they tend to work with communists? McLaren: I would say that a person like Elizabeth Gilman was not anti-communist. She was just pro-socialist. She was a socialist. And from her point of view, communism and socialism were essentially the same thing. She didn't make those fine distinctions. M.F.: Sherwood Anderson. Eleanor Anderson's. . . . McLaren: No, he didn't have anything to do with it. M.F.: They were together in some of the organizing in the South early in the late '20s. McLaren: When did she marry Sherwood Anderson? M.F.: In *33 But in books, biographies of himthe only source that page 22 I havethey say that they were travelling together through the South. McLaren: In the '20s? M.F.: Late '20s.  '29, '30. McLaren: Wasn't he married at that time? M.F.: I don't know. He might have been. McLaren: I wouldn't think Eleanor would go for that. She was with the Y and from an old, Southern, aristocratic family. M.F.: Especially now, Southerners tend to be very defensive about anyone from the north coming down and doing anything. Did she ever have a problem with that? McLaren: No, not to my knowledge. I can't recall that anything of that kind ever arose. I think there were plenty of people who didn't like the school, but it wasn't for that reason. It was because of the influence on the southern girls. M.F.: Do you remember anyone who gave the school a lot of trouble? McLaren: No. They had good relationships with the merchants. They were glad to have us around, in the area. M.F.: So who were the main enemies of the school? McLaren: I don't recall any enemies. I suppose in the background the manufacturers were the main enemies. This kind of animal that I'm talkingthat German who was the owner of the mills at Marion. I think he came here from Germany. M.F.: But you never saw those people, did you? I mean any of the managers or the manufacturers, the owners. McLaren: No. The people at the school didn't pay much attention to that. They didn't care who they were. Louise I think was probably a little naive about that kind of thing. She'd just go on anyway, without caring page 23 who they were. M.F.: Would you describe her as an active New Deal supporter? McLaren: You mean a Roosevelt person? Of course we supported Roosevelt always. M.F.: Was she happy with the work that the New Deal did? McLaren: She was very happy with the CIO in that job she did. M.F.: And they were supporting Roosevelt in the campaign? McLaren: Of course. M.F.: Didn't the school receive a lot of WPA money in the mid '30s? McLaren: No. They never received any money except what Louise raised alone or through her friends. Pearl Willen was one of the best money raisers. And the Jewish people here in New York. M.F.: Do you remember the Washington committee? Wasn't there a committee of supporters in Washington? McLaren: I think there was but I don't know much about it. M.F.: Do you remember a woman named Virginia Duer? McLaren: Oh yes. I didn't know her. Her husband had some rather good position in Washington. He was a lawyer, wasn't he? He worked some while in the government, but not as a government employee. M.F.: I want to say the Federal Power Commission. McLaren: Yes, something of that kind. M.F.: And I think they were in Virginia for quite a while. In Arlington, right near Washington. McLaren: Louise knew her and knew him. But I didn't know either one of them. M.F.: She had such a wide circle of contacts in the South with the school. Did she maintain a lot of those all the years she was in New York page 24 after she left? McLaren: Some of them. A great many of them. There was a Mrs Cravner, who was the wife of an Episcopalian rector. They were in Alabama. I had dinner at their home once and I must have been in Asheville. I think he came up from there, Alabama. I'm vague on it. It wasn't in Alabama. M.F.: Cravner. I think I remember that name from an Asheville group that was supporting the school. McLaren: Bet it was Mrs Cravner. He didn't do anything. He was a rector in the Episcopal church. M.F.: I've been very curious about for instance the YWCA and the YMCA. It seems that in the South in the '20s and '30s, the YWCA was way out in front as far as a progressive movement was concerned. McLaren: They were, as I understand it. There's one organization that was in ill repute with the employers around the country. . . was this industrial department of the YWCA. It came to be. It happened that they got a whole group of very fine women in that department. Eleanor Anderson was one. And there were several others. They were all Christians, of course. Remember Rauschenbush? Social consciousness Christian? Well, many of them were followers of Rauschenbush and they carried their beliefs out into the industrial world. And employers didn't like it at all. M.F.: Do you know how long the industrial department lasted? McLaren: For quite a while after Louise was in it, but I think it is a dead thing now. It's gone. For some time they've been having a hard. . . . I don't know, I think I read somewhere that this building is coming down. I think I read it, I don't know. Anyway, they're having a bad time. I always have a lot of high regard for the YWCA. Not much for the YMCA. M.F.: Why do you think the YWGA was so different? page 25 McLaren: Because they had that industrial department and they showed a lot of interest in working girls. I mean real interest. Not just a place for them to play pool or. . . M.F.: Learn how to swim. McLaren: Something like that. There's something to be said for that, but it's not much. M.F.: Do you think it was because of these women who got into it? Your wife and Eleanor Anderson and. . . . McLaren: Yes, that's where. . . it was developed within the YWGA a powerful industrial department. Too powerful to suit the people who give the money to the Y. And that's their problem now. They still have trouble raising money. And so the industrial department just petered out. As long as Eleanor Anderson was here, they still had an industrial department, I think. M.F.: When did she leave the Y? McLaren: Quite a few years ago now. She's not young. I was talking to somebody about her just the other day. I was surprised. . . she was much younger than Louise. I should have known that but I didn't. She's in the seventies. M.F.: Did she work for them until she retired? McLaren: The Y? I don't know for sure. I think so.  She has spent a lot of time I think since Sherwood Anderson died about his works. You know, getting them published and keeping them published and so forth. M.F.: She holds all the copyrights, I think. McLaren: I think so. And then for a long time they had a store here in New York where they sold stuff from the mountains. She was back of that. M.F.: I didn't realize they had a store in New York. They have one page 26 in Virginia. But she ran one in New York for a while? McLaren: When I was at the school one summer I got some of that material. . . the Biltmore homespun. Men's clothing. I have that suit yet. And I tried to get some more, but you know, it's just like everything else in this country. The woman who wrote to me was frank about it. She said they just can't get the weavers that they used to have. And she admits that the cloth is not what it used to be. It's lighter in weight. That suit I have could stand the coldest weather. But the stuff they're offering now. . . it's good, it's very good as compared with the shoddy that's on the market, but it's not the kind of stuff they made back in the '30s and '40s. And she admits it. See, I had a sample of that old stuff and I sent it to her and asked her whether I could get that. M.F.: Why couldn't they get weavers? McLaren: They don't exist, as I understand it. M.F.: No one knows how to do it? McLaren: That's the interpretation I put on, but I can't believe that there aren't some. There must be some. M.F.: I was wondering if the plant had become so mechanized. . . . McLaren: At one time it was made in the mountains, I think, way back in the beginning. On hand looms. And then, as I understand it, they moved some of these people down into a factory in Asheville. There's a town called Biltmore just out of Asheville. And it probably became citified and when you become citified you lose your skill. M.F.: While the school was in operation that's what was happening, wasn't it? A lot of people were moving from the mountains to the urban areas. McLaren: Going into mills. Of course the Biltmore place was not a mill. It was a very different kind of place. And I don't know what their page 27 relationship was with the workers. I think the workers had some kind of share in it. M.F.: Back to the school for just a minute. Do you think the reason the school was able to. . . . I was very impressed with the way your wife maintained relationships to the right, to the left, across the entire political spectrum. McLaren: Well, I'm telling you. . . I'm prejudiced, of course, but she was terrific. In personal relationships. M.F.: A lot of other people have said that also. She stated time and time and time again that there was no indoctrination, that the school was open, that that was the basic thing about it. That discussion was free and open and everyone was to have a say. McLaren: That kind of thing that came through to her through her family. Stayed with her throughout her life. She went further to the left as she got older, but she still had that. . . . M.F.: When you say she went further to the left, was she sort of unorganized politically? Was it only further to the left in her own thinking? McLaren: In her own thinking. She never belonged to a party. She never even belonged to the Democratic party. M.F.: She just voted for. . . . McLaren: That's right. I don't know exactly what one would mean by belonging. She registered as a Democrat for some time. I suppose that makes you a Democrat. Well, you do two things here in New York. You enroll, you register, which you have to do in order to vote for any ticket. And if you want to, you can enroll in a party, which enables you to vote in a primary. If you're not enrolled in a party, of course you can't vote page 28 in a primary in that party. And I think that at one time she was both . . . she was registered, which she had to be in order to vote, and enrolled in the Democratic party. But in later years she was not enrolled in the Democratic party because she didn't. . . well, she was moving away from that. That was long after the school. M.F.: But through the years of the New Deal she stuck pretty close to the. . . . McLaren: Well, both of us always had let's say a great love for Roosevelt. But even there, as we became older we understood that that wasn't the answer. It was the answer for that time. We would have had a terrible bad, no good revolution if it hadn't been for Roosevelt. It wouldn't have been a revolution. It would have been chaos. M.F.: Do you think in the early years, before the New Deal got under way, like in '30 and '31, when things really were kind of tittering on the brink of chaos. . . McLaren: They were tittering, there's no question about it, when Roosevelt came into power. Came into office. M.ff.: Do you think the New Deal pretty much took the sails out of socialist and communist, out of those becoming very active and powerful parties? McLaren: I wouldn't say that they did because there wasn't enough sail in either one of them to take much out. They weren't strong enough. Didn't have enough following and they didn't have enough ideology. And they didn't have the leadership. To put it another way, they didn't have anybody around at that time like Debs. M.F.: Norman Thomas wasn't. . . McLaren: Oh no. He was a nice person. I knew him personally. page 29   M.F.: Was he just a weak leader? McLaren: No, he wasn't weak. He was a strong man. He sacrificed his life. . . or rather dedicated it. In other words, Thomas could have been a big shot in a corporation or something else, if he wanted to be. But he saw fit to be a socialist and live poor and die poor. And he was a good leader. He got a lot of votes, you know. Once or twice. M.F.: You just think there was never the basic support there to. . . . McLaren: No. It wasn't strong enough at the time of the depression for anybody to put across any socialism. And what happened, as communists would say, objectively had to happen. Roosevelt. That's what history was ready for at that time. History in this country was not ready for it. It had happened in the Soviet Union in a very peculiar way. No body expected it to happen there. But it couldn't happen here. All that could happen here was chaos. I saw some of it. I was teaching in Annapolis at that time. Remember when the march on Washington in 1932? '32 I think it was, or '31. And they were driven out of Washington. When was that? 'gl wasn't it? When Hoover was there. And Roosevelt came in in '32, didn't he? When they drove them out of Washington and they went up to Gettysburg, a lot of them. And Louise and I drove up there one weekend to take a look. Those were the people who could have torn things apart, but that's all they would have done, is tear things apart. They had no ideology, no guidance. They were starving. They were hungry people. I have read. . . along about that period. . . I have read it and I think in an authentic place, that one person was starving to death in this country every 17 minutes at that time. M.F.: You and your wife obviously were very aware of that. Were you unusual in being aware of it? page 30 McLaren: We were unusual. . . well, I would say in our class, academic class, however I never had any trouble about it and I said what I thought in my classroom. I used to urge my students to get apple carts and go in the apple business. M.F.: One other question and then I'll stop. Part of the difficulty in studying this period in the '20s and '30s was what happened afterwards in the '50s, the HUAG thing. What that did to people who were. . . McLaren: The '50s is something else again. The '50s were a period of terrible reaction. McCarthy and so forth. Right now, things have eased off and have been for some time. But God only knows what's going to happen. M.F.: Don't you think the decade of the '50s has made everyone really on edge about what they were involved in in the '20s and '30s? I mean I just want your feeling as far as going around and talking to people about what they were doing during that period and what they thought was important. It just seems to me that the '50s and HUAG and McCarthy makes it all very difficult to put into proper perspective what people were doing in the '20s and '30s. Would yuu agree? McLaren: It was tough at that time. I was working then in the American Labor Party. M.F.: This was in the '50s? McLaren: Yeah. And it went on and did some good work. I don't know just how effective it really was. Something to be determined yet. And it finally died. It was really a continuation of the New Deal, beyond the time when it was useful. It was a little more advanced than the New Deal. Remember Vito Marcantonio? Congressman from New York. Well, he was the big man and a very good man. Killed himself. I don't mean he committed suicide. But he worked so hard, threw himself into it so much, died on the page 31 ,                                          - - .-  , r street from a heart attack. As I recall, the party was still rather strong at that time and that was the end of it. It was too much of that, too much of a one man thing. And he was a very good man, but I don't care how good you are, it won't work. It finally peters out. M.F.: I felt, going through the papers of the summer school, that a lot of times your wife was a one-woman. . . I mean she was the one who held everything together. McLaren: She was not a one-woman person at all. The reason why she clicked was that she worked with other people. And she had a way of working with them. If there was anything she hated, it was being a one-woman person. M.F.: She wasn't a loner at all? McLaren: Lord no. Just the opposite. M.F.: Lois MacDonald. They were together on the founding of the school. Did they retain their. . . was Lois always a supporter of the school? McLaren: Oh yes. She taught there in the last year, I think. Taughter there I think in the first year. I think she taught there every year. Maybe there was one year when she didn't. I noticed in reading over this thing that there was a Belle Wolf. I knew Belle Wolfe, of course. I was there that summer. But I'm unaware of the fact that he [Bill Wolfe?] took her place that summer. Maybe he did. I don't know. M.F.: I think there might have been even a couple of summers when she couldn't come. Her responsibilities at New York University. McLaren: Maybe so. But if she wasn't there, it was for some. . . she was held here for some reason. Because the school was very dear to her. M.F.: She and your wife remained the leaders. . . page 32 McLaren: And they had been friends before the school opened, I think. As a matter of fact I think they lived together here in New York away back yonder. M.F.: They might have met in the YWCA. McLaren: Maybe I'm making this up. I don't know. You going to see Lois? I think you'll find out that they did room together. Maybe right here in the Y. I have a big imagination. M.F.: I don't think I have any more questions. If you can straighten me out on any other points. . . . McLaren: Well, of course there's one thing. . . . Again the school was not much criticized at that time about this. It has been criticized since. And I criticize it myself, I think. There were no black people in it. But, as I look back. . . you talk about antagonism of the people. If we'd had black girls in he school, there would have been antagonism. The place would have been raided. I'm sure of it. You know, the school never met. ... I wanted to speak about that. Somewhere I got the impression that a lot of people think and some literature gives the impression that this school met in Asheville. It never met in Asheville. M.F.: Did it not meet at the Asheville normal school. Twice. McLaren: I don't think so. Now you can check with Lois MacDonald, but I think the school. . . they were sometimes very. . . you know where Weaverville is? They were at that college out there, a Methodist college. Mr Shorebridge, whom I liked very much, was president of the college. That's only three or four or five miles from Asheville. They met around Burnsville. That'sanother job my wife had. Every year she had to go rummaging aroundalmost every year, sometimes they got the same place twice to find a place for the school. One year we were back in a place that was page 33 owned by some kind of a fashionable woman who didn't have any use for it at that time. I don't know what it had been. It was a large building. Whether she had some kind of school back there. She was interested in riding horses, that kind of thing. And didn't care a hoot about the school. I mean what kind of ideas they had or didn't have.  She just had this place and was willing to rent it. Back in the woods. We were there one year. And we were at Weaverville, I think for two years. Near Hendersonville. Almost always in some kind of church school that didn't operate in the summer. They were poor, you know, and they needed money. And they were glad to get the money. M.F.: No, I've seen that also. The Southern Summer School for Women Workers in Industry in Asheville, North Carolina. McLaren: No, I don't believe the school was ever in Asheville. Go back to the first years. It was at Burnsville. I don't know what they were in there, at Burnsville. They were in this place right here. That I never saw. That's before we were married. M.F.: Carolina New College I think is the name of it. McLaren: So I think every year they were in some such place. Usually a church school. M.F.: It's a remarkable organization to me. Has anyone else come to talk to you about it? Has anyone else done research on it that you know? McLaren: No. Know where Brevard is? They were down there a couple of years. Some school there. Not at Brevard. Outside the town. To the best of my knowledge, they were never in a town. These places are out in the country. In the mountains somewhere. Everyone that I was at was out in the country. The one at Henderson was aboutI say at Hendersonville, by at I mean we were near it, the place where we did our shopping. I think page 34 it was five, six miles from Hendersonville. Maybe only four miles, I don't know. Quite a little drive. M.F.: You said you never attended any of the classes. Did you ever teach any of them? McLaren: No, no. I couldn't have taught. My field was very different. I was in philosophy and psychology. You wouldn't teach philosophy in that kind of school. M.F.: Where did you do your graduate work? McLaren: Chicago and Columbia. New York University.   New School for Social Research and several others.  Which was a very different place than it is now. Maybe it's better now. I don't know. I think it was better then. It was a purely intellectual place at that time. Now I think they teach knitting down there. M.F.: Where was your family from? McLaren: My family? I was born in southern Michigan near Ann Arbor and went to the University of Michigan. I have a law degree from the University of Michigan. My people were farmers. My mother's people were German. There's something interesting about them. Both she and my grandfather Shank. They both came out of Germany in the night to get away from the Kaiser. You know, people. . . they ran away at that time in Germany. They were not allowed to come over here if the government could stop them. But as you know, thousands of them came. They're called the I848ers. Around I85O. They're called the 1848ers. My grandfather and grandmother didn't know each other until they met here in the United States. And they were both farm people. I think they worked for farmers. I don't know. Who were already here. Anyway, they met and they bought a farm that was said to be no good. Couldn't raise beans page 35 on it, as they used to say out in Michigan. As a matter of fact, beans you need a good soil if you're going to get good beans. And you should have seen that farm after they had it 15 or 20 years. Beautiful big brick house. Beautiful barns. One of the richest farms in southern Michigan. Had 12 children. Like a lot of people in those days. And the main point I was trying to get at, you know Oberlin College? Oberlin College I'm toldand I believe it's correctwas founded to make a place for some southern youths. At that time they were men. Young men who didn't like slavery. Southern men. And who were religious. They wanted to be ministers. And it started out as a theological seminary for these young men who would escape or run away from the South. And my grandfather was one of the founders of that college. Gave money to help found it.  In other words, on that farm he made money. Enough so he could do that kind of thing. M.F.: How did you first become interested in workers? Especially industrial workers? McLaren: It's not too difficult to understand. I thought about that a good deal. What people don't understand is. . . I was brought up on that great big farm. About the same size as my grandfather's. Ours was a little larger. At one time we worked over 800 acres out there with horses. And we had a lot of help. And we had two Germans who came over here from Germany, to my grandfather. Of course I didn't know when that happened. That was before I was born. They were there when I was born. Johnny Beir [?] and George Beir. Brothers. And they were with us for almost 20 years. And Johnny was a second father to me. Sometimes I think he was my first father. And I worked with him and I admired him. To me he's one of the greatest men ever lived. A terrific worker. And I learned to work from him. And we worked. People don't know what work page 36 is nowadays as compared with what we used to do on our farm. Up at four and five o'clock in the morning, the year around. And work until seven or eight dclock at night. After you had your dinner at night you went down and milked the cows. Fifteen or 20 cows. That was your rest period. By that time it was time to go to bed or almost. In other words, I was brought up on work and I was brought up on democracy. All the workers sat at the table, same table we sat at. And we talked. They were members of the family. And I've always been interested in workers. Although I drifted away from it for a while. Emotionally I didn't drift away from it. Then I landed down in Maryland, among the Maryland aristocracy and I even bought a tuxedo suit! But I didn't wear my tuxedo suit at Lizzie Gilman's. Didn't have to.  Lizzie was a socialist. And that's when I began drifting away again in the other direction. When I found Lizzie's place.  She had all kinds of people there, you know. Every week. She had a lot of money. And she'd never been married and that was her life. M.F.: Did you know Ken Douty there? He was apparently very close to her. McLaren: Yes.  I know the name but the person I can't remember. What was he? A professor? M.F.: He eventually became very active in organizing in the South but that was in the '40s. He was younger. He would have been quite a bit younger than most of the. . . . McLaren: The name I remember very well, but the person I didn't know. For some reason I missed him. M.F.: What about Alice Hanson Cook? McLaren:  Oh yes, I know her.  Is she teaching yet? M.F.: She's still teaching. I guess she's officially sort of page 37 retired, but she's still teaching a class. McLaren: I think they probably have retirement at 70 years, probably, and I was wondering whether she's 70. I think so, but not much older. M.F.: She is still teaching. The day I was there she taught a class. But she was with the school for five or six years, I think, as a teacher.  Right? McLaren: She was there much of the time, and especially at the time when I was there. Whether she was there in those years before, I don't know. She's a very good teacher, I think.
