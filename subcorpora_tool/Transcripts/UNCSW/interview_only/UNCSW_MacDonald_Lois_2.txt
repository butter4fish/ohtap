Lois Macdonald:  ... . straightened out as to when .... Marion Roydhouse:  . . . who was going to be called (?) when. Macdonald:  Yeah, when I was coming.  I was supposed to come Thursday, I think.  Well, I hope it got straightened. Professor Hobhouse was an elderly man.  At that time he was practically retired1923, '24, the academic year. But a group of us used to go out to his house, somewhere out I don't remember where it was.  It took about half an hour on the bus.  And with one exception we were American studentsTalcott Parsons, he was the sociologist from Harvard; Frank Graham . . . Roydhouse:  Oh, from U.N.C.? Macdonald:  Yeah, from U.N.C.  Now Frank was around in about the ... he was already an established man; the rest of us were little ants running trying to find a little spot for ourselves.  Well, we talked at great length informally with Prof. Hobhouse.  He was interested; he liked American students.  And fee wanted to know why we were there and what we planned to do.  And I discussed my general, unformed ideas at that time.  And he said, "Well, my dear.  If that is your interest, go home.  Don't stay here.  Go home and 2. and do your work in the country where your face (?) is, and you'll find that very satisfactory." Well, that plus my financial inability to stay, I decided to come back.  So I then came back and I decided to go for a Ph.D.  I spent three or four years taking some courses, doing a little work on the side.  I did a little editing and a little teaching and managed to keep myself going.  Then I got by contacts, friends that I hadln the Y.W.C.A., I got what would be called now a fellowshipalthough it wasn't called that then. Henry Ford, the old man, had a lot of crazy ideas.  One of them was that industry should be decentralized, and the industrial plant should be out in the rural areas so people could work in the plant when times were good;when times were hard they could cultivate their gardens, their corn patches. They could live.  Somebody told him, well if that is what you have in mind (you're going to advocate that), what you should do is to find out what life is like in these decentralized, industrial, semi-rural,semi-industrial areas. So he gave to the Y.W.C.A., some group in the Y.W., quite for those day a sizable sum of money to have a series of studies made as to the function in the community groups, the kind of life that people lived.  And I got the assignment to go down South and go into some of these textile company towns and see what was going on.  Talk with people.  Find 3. out from the point of view of the churches and the schools and the what-have-you's what life was like. Roydhouse:  This was for your dissertation? Macdonald:  Yes, and I wrote a report, more or less following the outline of the Y.W.C.A.thing.  They had some studies made of the Middle West and they had one or two made up in New England.  One person did something in a Connecticut town where they manufactured pianos as the kind of one-industry town.  Although I don't believe it was a company town.  These communities that I went into were company owned and controlled. So I spent about a year down South.  I was in Charlotte at what was called the Hoskins Mill.  I think it's now out of business or it's been combined; but you could get out there by streetcar. Roydhouse:  These were the studies of the two villages Macdonald:  Three Roydhouse: Yeah, three.  This was the one in North Carolina? Macdonald:  Yes, that was the only one in North Carolina. The other two were in South Carolina.  Greenville was the other industrial center that I spent some time in.  And when I was in Greenville, I lived in a mill village.  I went around and asked around a little bit.  There was a woman who had a son who works in the mill and she had a house and 4. a room, so ... I can't remember what sort of a story I told, I was making some investigation.  So I lived with this family and got along pretty well, except in order to operate that I had to go see the mill management.  And I told them that I was not a labor organizer, which was true.  And, in general, I told them who I was.  My uncle was a judge who was well-known around in the state.  So I made my contacts there.  Then I went around talked to teachers, ministers.  There were very few community organizations of any sort in those days.  But I got out of this Greenville village just one step ahead of the sheriff because a labor organizer by the name of MacDonald (to this day I don't know who the person was, I think it was a man) appeared in the village and made some contacts with some of the workers.  And the grapevine went out that there was a MacDonald there who was a labor organizer.  So they sent the sheriff after me, but I had left the day before.  I missed that; I happened to get this because I went back a couple of times to pick up some loese ends that I needed to sort of check on again.  And I was told by this woman whose house I had lived in.  She was very incensed because she thought I had misled her and she would hardly talk to me when I appeared and wanted to.  I don't think I wanted to ask her any questions, but I was there and I went in just as a . . . you know . . . and this old lady was just 5. ready to crack my bones.  I assured her this was all a mistake. And then, after I had done this report for the Y.W.C.A., (they had a kind of a format that they wanted for all studies so that they could put the whole business together) and I had arranged with them .that I would have the material, and then I got off on the side and worked it up into a dissertation. Roydhouse:  What was the village in North Carolina outside Charlotte, Hoskins Mill? MacDonald:  Yes, the Hoskins was a fairly small mill and I did not live in that village because it was . . . I can't remember, it was an awful long time ago.  For some reason I decided it was not a particularly good thing to try to   (?)   , so I lived most of the time in the Y.W.C.A. although I had relatives in Charlotte that I used to go and visit with a lot.  But I had my office and my setup at the Y.W.C.A. building. Roydhouse:  And the other village, was that in South Carolina? MacDonald:  Yes Roydhouse: When you began your introduction to your dissertation, you talked about Marjorie Potwin's study and the other ones that you disagreed with.  Did you know Marjorie Potwin at all? 6. Macdonald: Well, I had met her but I really didn't know her.. We didn't speak the same language.  Professor Howard Odum, who was at the UniversityI knew him.  I had been to see him , get some advice from him, and she was sort of a protoge of his.  So I met her there but we had never any,what you call, intellectual interchange of any sort. Because in the meantime, you see, I had been to New York getting this academic work behind me and when I had finished and was looking around for some spot, there wasn't a spot for me in the South except to teach.  If I'd wanted to I think I could have taught at Hollins College.  You know Hollins don't you? Roydhouse:  Yes, yes. MacDonald Where is it? Lynchburg.  But somehow or other I wasn't interested in that kind of a thing.  I wanted something different.  While I was finishing up my Ph.D., Prof. Atkins (who when I first met him was at Chapel Hill) had moved to New York University. Roydhouse:  Was his wife Claire Atkins? MacDonald:  Claire, uh huh.  And he offered me a sort of a teaching fellowship.  I had done most of my course work but I needed a little time to bone up for my orals for the final exam.  And he said, Well, come on down." : The interesting thing about it is that he, as head of the department, had just practically appointed me.  Then he 7. called me up and he said, "I'm going to fix the dean of the college." He said, no, he didn't think women could teach economics.  And Willard Atkins sought of caught that, and I said, "Well, forget it. I'll do something else." Well, I did something else.  I think that Willard helped me to get a fellowship where I was able to live in Greenwich Village on  , what is it that they call it, proletarian specials,without doing any outside work.  And the dean died the next year, and Willard said,        ."If you want this, come on, let's get going." And he said, "There are a lot of people who agree with the dean, that women can't teach economics.  But you take a try at it and if you come out alright then we'll see what else."  Well I must have come out all right because I stayed there. Eoydhouse:  For a year.  Can you tell me a bit about why you disagreed? I don't understand how there was such a difference in the views of Marjorie Potwin, and there was another one Bertha Heft(?) who wrote her M.A. thesis under Howard Odum.  There's such a disparity in the  (?) MacDonald:  I'don't know whether I've ever seen the Heft .... Roydhouse:  No, I think it was probably . . . No, I just found it at U.N.C.. It wasn *t particularly well-known or anything like that. MacDonald:  The main reason was that Marjorie.Potwin 8. thought that these company towns were just beautiful and that there was freedom and there was great (?),placid living there.  And I was convinced, by having lived there. And in the meantime, the summer school got going and we had these girls there with their stories and background and I just thought that Marjorie Potwin just had on rose-colored glasses and really wasn't down to brass tacks. But she wrote one study,that was one where there was much to do in terms of texts, ideas laid out.  Then she did another one , I think it was The Faces We See. Roydhouse:  That's one I haven't seen. MacDonald: ... I think .... Roydhouse:  I think it would still be avilable at U.N.C.. MacDonald:  Yea, it must be there somewhere.  I used to have a copy.  I'll tell you what's happened to me.  I've given all my materials away and what I hadn't given away to Mary. (?). . . Roydhouse:  I'll see .... MacDonald:  But whatever, she has the ...  . As a matter of fact I gave her something , kind of a reprint of an article I had written.  And she had it photostated and sent me back a copy.  Which is about all I have left. I'll try to think where that . . . well, you can find it 9. anyway.  It's a pictorial.(?) And you'd look at that and you'd think that these people in these mill villages were just living on a pink cloud.  And then you see, all through the South 1929, '28, '29, '30, there was this eruption where the whole think blew up.  Now it was patted down very vigorously, but the elements were there for great discontent and great . . . Roydhouse:  Upheaval . . . MacDonald: . . something or other.  There again it seeems to me that what happened more or less sustained my thesis rather than hers.  But I never got into any altercations directly about it with her.  Then there was another person who used to  . . . seems to me maybe Harriet Herring. Roydhouse:  Oh, yes. MacDonald:  The person who did The Faces We See. Roydhouse:  She could have been it. MacDonald:  I haven't thought about this in years.  I reviewed- The Faces We See and the title of my review was "Behind the Faces We See".  So I indicated, pointed to what the actual events seemed to indicate. Roydhouse:  Yeah, sure.  In the book you do mention the women particularly and I was interested in the women's lives in the villages.  Can you tell me aU-ittle bit more about the attitude towards housework and working, what they 10. saw themselves to be? MacDonald:  Well, I must say I don't.....I don't know any specifics to answer that question.  What I got that would throw most light on it was the girls at the summer school.  And they were people, some of whom were married and some were not.  Most of them were married but unable to get loose from family obligations and get up to the school.  I doubt if many of them thought about themselves at all.  I think they, generally speaking, accepted the lines of life that they'd fallen heir to.  The discussion and the talk most of the time in summer school, both formally in classes and informally outside, was mostly about the conditions in the mills.  I think that seemed to be their preoccupation.  But, we had in the school a rather selected group, you know. Roydhouse:  Yes. MacDonald:  And they were people who had been in these industrial clubs that the Y.W.C.A. had around the industrial communities, in Durham.  Incidentally there are two girls in Durham, women,  if they're still living I think you might .... Roydhouse:  I did bring a list of people I wondered if you knew anything about. MacDonald:  Well, there's a Mrs.Ruth Culberson is one 11. person.  And Thelma . . . Roydhouse:  Lloyd, Thelma Lloyd? MacDonald:  Thelma Lloyd, yes.  They were from Durham.  Now whether they're still there or whether they're still extant, I don't know.  Ruth Culberson went on up to Vineyard Shore (?), the school that Jamie (?) Smith had up in her old ancestral spot up on the Hudson.  And then Ruth went back and worked some worker's education conventions round about.  And I don't know what has ever happened tc her.. Roydhouse:  I knew a little bit about how the first Southern Summer School started, just from reading the papers it put out, but but could you tell me about how you got involved in the first meetings that you had? Why you decided to have a Southern summer school? MacDonald:  Well, the main reason was that Louise Leonard (she was then, she's Louise McLaren after she was married) was the regional industrial secretary with the Y.W.C.A. in that whole section with headquarters in Atlanta.  And she knew all these industrial secretaries and they were really the spark plugs. Roydhouse:  So, it really was the Y.W.? MacDonld:  It was the Y.W. where they had organized clubs of industrial girls. In Durham they were,in those 12. clubs, tobacco workers, textile workers, a general mixture of people.  But the Y.W.C.A. was the organization that had direct contact with women workers.  And the Bryn Mawr school had been going for a year or two.(as a matter of fact I taught there for two summers.) And, I don't know,we thought it would be an interesting, good idea, (laughing)to have something that would more-or-less be geared to the conditions in the South. Roydhouse:  Specifically. MacDonald:  Specific conditions.  And I don't know what the rationale was beyond that. Roydhouse:  Did you think that the women who entered Bryn Mawr were getting as much out of it as others did? MacDonald:  I don't think there was any sort of comparison of that kind.  I think it was more . . . maybe a . . . . There are certain kinds of southern people that I call professional southerns, who seem to capitalize on what is supposed to be differences.  I think there are very few when you get down, really, to brass tacks.  There may ..have been, a little southern chauvinism, but I don't remember that particulary.  There was a feeling that the area was ripe for some kind of social development and this was one way of doing it.  And Louise McLaren raised the money, and we always ran a shoe stringit was a very 13. meager kind of an operation. Roydhouse:  Well, how important was Louise? MacDonald:  I think she was very important in the early stages.  She got together a group of people  (?) Frank Graham was on the board for years; Mary Barker, who was a teacher from Atlanta, was at that time president of the American Federation of Teachers.  There was Mrs. Elizabeth Otey from Lynchburg who was a Bryn Mawr graduate, you know, of the real college.  Her husband was an industrialist, but she had social interests.  And then there was ... I can't remember the other people, but they were people who were educators and other people who just had a general social interest.  And Mr. Lindeman, Eduard Lindeman--has his name come in? He had nothing to do with this, because he was a sociology professor at the women's college in Greensboro. Roydhouse:  Oh, uh huh. MacDonald: And moved on up to the New York School of Social Wort. He was very close to a woman who had a lot of money and she was interested in it. Roydhouse:  Who was that? MacDonald:  Mrs. .... Roydhouse:  It wasn't one of the     (?) or anyone? Was it from North Carolina? 14. MacDonald:  No, No.   This was a woman . . . she was a Whitney.  She married a British man and finally wound up supporting his      (?)        .  Ah, it's right on the tip of my tongue.  It will come to me later on.  But she had money, inheirited money, and she had a feeling it should be used for folks, good causes.  And she and Mr. Lindeman were very good friends, so he interested her in subsidizing part of this activity.  And then there were a couple of local radical groups that gave us the money. Roydhouse:  Who were they? MacDonald:  The Garland Fund, and after .... Roydhouse:  I've read about them.  Can you tell me more about them? MacDonald:  The Garland Fund was a fund set up by a young man who inheirited a sizable fortune and he believed that inheirited wealth was immoral, or what have you.  So he set up this fund.  And he was a left-winger; he was a radical.  And the person who for years was the chairman or the chief operator in this Garland Fund was a woman communist ... it comes to me as Kate    (?)   and that isn't it.  Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.  And she was one of the people way up yonder in the communist hierarchy.  But she was a very fine person, and she believed in grass roots sorts of things.  So she used to be responsible, I think, for the Garland Fund giving substance (?) or money. Now when the witch hunt got going on the summer school 15. that didn't help a lot, but it helped a lot at the time, because it meant the difference of having some money to work with. Roydhouse:  When the first committee began, it was different from the Bryn Mawr committee according to  (?). There were more people from labor, from labor organizations and from workers themselves than had been in the Bryn Mawr school. MacDonald:  That's right. Roydhouse:    Was there a reason for that? MacDonald:  Well, I think that there was a reason for it.   Well, the main thing was that the person who sparked the Bryn Mawr summer school was President M. Carey Thomas, who was a nice old autocrat.  She ran the show, and anybody who disagreed with her just didn't stay there very long.  Well, that was a set-up,you see; it was that kind of a thing.  And in the southern school, we had a feeling that it should be a representative group and you wanted some people who could represent you to the public and who were interested and whose name would maybe help raise a little cash.  People like Frank Graham.  I've forgotten who the other so-called educators were, but right straight through there were students who were on the board.  Each year, when the new board was selected, there 16. was always a place provided for the students.  And if you wanted to work with the labor organizations, by that time there were a few people here and there you could pull in. There was a man namedWilliam Birthright (you've run into his name) who was an official with the barbers' union. Roydhouse:  Was he from Tennessee? MacDonad:  Tennessee.  And he for years was on the board.  And when William Green directed that, all of the AFofL people have nothing more to do with this school. Mr. Birthright and Mary Barker told William Green to go jump in the lake.  They were two people who . . . Roydhouse: . . . who stayed? MacDonald:  . . . who stayed.  Mary Barker said she went up, made a trip to Washington, went in to see William Green and she said, "You just don't know what you're talking about." And he didn't listen to her, 'cause she was a woman.  And he probably was a little suspicious of her anyway. But at any rate, the southern school was indigenous, you know, and in so far as possible, it was pushed back in to the people who were most concerned. Roydhouse:  What were your relations like with whatever labor movement there was, in the South anyway? MacDonald:  It was very good. 16. Roydhouse:  From the beginning? MacDonald:  From the beginning, although there was practically nothing to put your finger on.  But I think Louise used to consult with a lot of people who . . . the educational director, for example, of the International ladies Garment Workers was interested and he didn't direct the representative of the Garment Workers,  But I think people like that were sought after, and , in so far as it existed,  the labor voice was brought in and was heard. Roydhouse:  In Bryn Mawr I got the impression that sometimes, what the school was doing was educating women originally not just for labor organizing.  It was helping the women themselves, and their creative passtimes were just as important.  Do you think that was so with the southern summer school? MacDonald:  Well, a little bit.  I think that the kind of aura at the top in Bryn Mawr was paternalistic, and in the southern summer school it wasn't.  It was down-to-earth.  The southern summer school didn't expect any specific thing from any student.  A good many of them went back right in their groove, and perhapsexcept by way of some personal enrichment, an experiencehad no change in their life.  On the other hand, a significant number of them were moved on from the    (?)   .  An outstanding person 17. would be Helen Gregory, who for many years was (   1 to her death a few years ago) one of the chief organizers for the textile union in the South.  But during much of this period there really wasn't very much of a students--they went back home to catch on to--except an accelerated interest.  I remember one thing they used to always do, was to recruit, to get other people interested, to have them to come. Roydhouse:  Well, I noticed in North Carolina that the people came from only a few towns; like they come from Durham, from High Point, from Greensboro, from Winston-Salem, and of course from Marion.  Was that a deliberate policy? MacDonald:  No, it was jus; the only place there were organized clubs, because that's where they were recruited, not through unions as they were at a later date.  But in these earlier years, the only place you had to get hold of everybody was in one of these industrial clubs.  And those are the cities in North Carolina that had industrial clubs, and there were programs and organizations.  The representatives of these clubs used to go to conferences every summer. Many of those went to conferences and had, there was something like an educational program although it was recreational,     (?)                     religion was stirred into it, but mostly the emphasis was on social programs. 18. Roydhouse:  So, therefore, your recruiting was almost all through the Y.W.? MacDonald:  In the early days, it was almost completely through the recruitment of the people through the Y.W. clubs. Roydhouse:  What about Bryn Mawr alumni, when they came in? Were they also involved in the clubs as well? MacDonald:  Yes, they were.  They used to be . . . I can't remember the years that I was at Bryn Mawr .  I was there for two summers I guess.  The only person that I can remember who was at Bryn Mawr who was from the South,  was a girl from Winston-Salem.  Her name is Ruby Clodfelter. Roydhouse:  Oh, yes. MacDonald:  Do you have her down? Roydhouse:  Yes. MacDonald:  There may have been others, but just off the cuff I can't think of ... . Roydhouse: Yes, there were quite a few others.  I wondered about Greensboro, actually.  That was another thing I've been wondering about.  Were the Cones opposed to you? Did you ever have any relations with the Cones and all the southern summer school? MacDonald:  No, I didn't.  Most of the time while I was in Greensboro,   the industrial interest was slowly 19. developing.  At that time, the industrial department of industrial club division of Y.W. in Greensboro wasn't very active.  There was a woman who was the general secretary of the Y.W., of the name of Mrs. Lula B. Kerr (?) , and she was a nice    (?)  person, didn't have a sense in her head (laughing).  But she was a, you know, glad-hander; she was great on the one thing she thought was just wonderful (she always used to be calling me up and I used to go down and see her every once in a while) the   (?)  Fellowship (?)    .   She just got hot, all steamed up.  So, with the person who was at the helm, even though there was this very interesting industrial set-up around in this city, I don't think the Y.W. had very much to .do with it, actually. And I didn't know the Cones at all.  I remember I took some of the girls, and some of the activities that we were ...   I think we'd been to a conference up to the Blue Ridge and there*d been some discussion therethere always were fraternal delegates from an industrial group. I don't know how it got going, but we decided to go and visit some of these places. We went out to the biggest  chemical company, and had a fine time.  They gave us samples .  That was just wonderful.  Then I made arrangements to take this group down to the Cone mills.  And at that time the Cones were making their fortune on denim.  This very nice young man, there must have been eight or ten of these girls that I'd drajged 20. down--and he took them through all the various processes. There were loads of women working in there.  And in the dyeing division--you know that's where the heat is a hundred and twenty , it's a very terrible atmosphere to work inone of the girls said to this young man, not in any objectionable way, she said, "This seems terrible that all these people have to work in this.  I can hardly stay in here; I'm about to faint." And he said, "Oh, you needn't worry.  These people are like animals."  And this girl I still remember her very well--her face looked as if somebody had given her a smack, but she didn't say anything.  But when we got out they just went to town.  They would have beaten this young man up, if they could have gotten hold of him.  That's the most contact I had with the Cones. Roydhouse:  Isn't it odd, of course, that one of the Cones, Mrs. Julius Cone, supported the League of Women Voters for most of the time.  And sheWiew Gertrude William (?) And I just wondered if she had any connection that you knew of? MacDonald: No, I didn't know any. I don't know that the Y.W. had any connection; at least I don't know of any. But she was an apparently very unusual woman, and she used her money--she was a very great friend of the college, not so much during the time that I was there, but later years she made some Very fine gifts to the college in the field 21. of arts and so on.  Though I never knew her, I think I may have met her socially sometime, but I never had, what you might call, working contacts with her. Roydhouse:  What about Harriett Elliott? MacDonald:  Well, Miss Elliott was just one of those people.  She had no interest in industrial affairs, but she was very interested in women. Roydhouse:  Oh. MacDonald:  She was a political scientist, you know. Roydhouse:  Yes. Macflonalds  She taught those courses.  And she used to just lambast the girls because, she said, "All you do in summer is to go home, sit out on the porch in a rocking chair and rock.  And you need to get up and get going, and organize something,"and so on.  She and I were very good friendsw^e had much contact with much sociabilityT-but I could never scratch much in terms of these industrial interests, that could be described that way.  But she was all for moving the girls up and making them get out, accomplish something.  She thought they ought to run for office, they just shouldn't sit home therethat is till you're old and gray (laughing).  But she was quite an influence in the . . . Roydhouse: . . in the school? MacDonald: ... in the school.  (?)     The girls 22. used to laugh at her a lot, because she was kind of a character.  This was sort of typical of her:  She was telling a story of something, see, and somebody came up and tapped her on the shoulder.  So the girls used to go around and say, "Tap me on the shoulder,"  (with exuberance). But they had a great affection for her, you know. Roydhouse:  Yeah. MacDonald:  Let's see who else, there at the college . . . .Mr. Lindeman, in the few years that he was there, had stimulated a great interest on the part of the students in social affairs.  As I remember, he and I overlapped by one year.  But I think there was some objection to his ideas, and I'm not sure that I rememberif I ever knew the full story, but I think that he got into some sort of compromising position because he had invited some Negro people to his house socially.  And that created a big hullabaloo, but I think he was about ready to move on anyway. Roydhouse:  Dr. Atkins taught workers' clases, didn't he?   (?) MacDonald:  He used to go to the Y.W.C.A conferences as a matter of fact, that's where he was when I first met him.  He was at the Y.W.C.A. conference at Junalusko,(?) North Carolina the summer that I came back from the School 23-of Economics.  And I went to that conference, well it was there, and that's when we first met.  He may have taught some classes in Durham, because he was at that timeMargaret Heinsberger was at that time the industrial secretary of the Y. in Durham, and they were good friends.  I m not quite sure about the details of what he did, but I know he was a good friend of all the, so-called, good works that were going on. Roydhouse:  What about Claire Atkins? MacDonald:  Well, Claire was Willard's wife and she never had much say.  She's a very, very nice person, a lovely person, but she never had any activities of her own. Roydhouse:  I see. MacDonald:  They had one daughter, one child; died there tragically, a few years ago.  And Willard, as you know, died a few years back too.  But Claire is still living ; she's in New York for the winter then she's in Califon (?),  which is up the other end of      (?) County.  They had a summer place there and she still goes out.  But she was always a very lovely person, but reflected more or less Willard*s views.  She didn't have any independent activities. Roydhouse:   It's at one stage   (?).  When I was reading the League of Women Voters papers they were talking about her.  I think she was social chairman of ...  (?) 24. Station, or she was going to be. MacDonald*When they were in North Carolina? Roydhouse:  North Carolina, yeah. MacDonald: Well I didn't know about thsb.  See, I had very little contact with them while they were there, and I think it must have been within a year that Willard moved to new York University.  And during the time that I knew Claire ... of course in a city like New York, you know, you don't develop activities very much unless you happen to be a person of very great ambitionsomething or other. Roydhouse: Yes. BEGIN SIDE II TAPE I Roydhouse:  Oh, I know.  When you're talking about the money for the school, how much of the, money that you did raise came from the South? MacDonald:  Very little. Roydhouse:  Okay.  What little there was, can you tell me anything about where it came from? MacDonald: I think that it came from, for example, Mrs. Otey, who was not a person of great wealth; I think Mrs. Otey always made a contribution to the school. And I think Mary Barkeragain, she had no great wealth but she 25. made a token contribution.  I think some of the industrial clubs used to chip in.  The hunks of money, the small hunks were the only thing that we ever had to work with, came from these foundationsfrom (I must remember this woman's name) Dorothy Whitney, Mr. Lindeman's girlfriend. Roydhouse:  I'm sure I can find out.  I should know myself, but I can't think  of it. MacDonald:   (?)        ... trying to rake up all of these names, so. Roydhouse:  Well, there were the people from the South. There was Mary Barker, there was Mrs. Otey, but how many of the teachers were southern? From looking at the list of people that I do have, it seems that the majority of them were not southern. MacDonald:  That's right. Roydhouse:  Do you think that made a difference to the school, to the women coming to the school? MacDonald:  No, I don't think it made any great amount of difference.  As a matter of fact, it isn't altogether accurate.  That first year we had the school at Sweetbriar (?), Broadus Mitchell was the economics teacher and I taught the English course.  Well, we were both southerners.  In fact, I think Broadus was born in Virginia but he spent most of his growing life in South 26. Carolina.  His father was president of the University of South Carolina for a good many years.  Broadus was somewhat older, a few years older than I.  I never knew him until later on, but I knew who he was because the sons of Dr. Samuel Mitchell were well-known figures.  I went to school myself, my first year away at college at Columbia. Dr. Mitchell at that time was president. So Broadus and I didn't meet until this summer school.  And then from about the next year, I guess, | taught the economics. And a person by the name of Miriam Bonner Roydhouse:  It was Miriam? MacDonald:  Yes. Roydhouse:   Sometimes I've seen articles where they've said her name was Marian. MacDonald:  No, Miriam. Roydhouse:  Okay. MacDonald:  Miriam Bonner Camp.   She now lives in California, but she was born and reared in North Carolina. Roydhouse:  Oh. MacDonald:   When I first knew her, she taught English at the women's college in Greensboro.  So it isn't just a cut and dried thing.  Then, for most of the years that the school ran, I was there as the teacher of economics course. And Miriam was there for a good many years, and then I 27. can't remember who else came in.  Alice Hanson, who is now at Cornell, she was from outside of the South.  She taught the English course for several years.  Marie Elliott, I think was there.  I've forgotten what Marie's function was but I'm sure her name is in some of these records. Roydhouse:  Another thing I was interested in was what was your attitude toward people like Frank Graham? They seemed to describe themselves as southern white liberals.  I thought that was a term that came up now, but I've read themselves describing themselves as that in the twenties.  What do you think the school's attitude was to the (?)   people? MacDonald:  Frank Graham was the godfather.  The students loved Frank Graham.  You never knew him of course. Roydhouse:  No, no. MacDonald:  He was a very small man in stature, but one of the finest heads, contour of his face, that I think I've ever seenalmost Grecian.  And one of the gentlest, sweetestI hate to use that word for a man but he really was just a darling man.  But he had a little iron in him.  If anybody attacked his basic ideas, he just stood right up and spoke back.  And the students admired him very, very much.  And he used to come and visit the school.  One of the things about Frank was that he would 28. never talk very long.  You know, he had a sense', you say your message and you say it quick, and then you go around and socialize with people. And in contrast todid you ever hear of Spencer Miller? Roydhouse:  No. MacDonald:  Spencer Miller was head of the Workers' Education Bureau, that was supposed to be the national workers' education where . . . Roydhouse:  Yes. MacDonald:  Well, he was a bag of wind; never had any classes or anything going.  He was a very affable person.  But he went aroundWilliam Green was hishe was William Green's idea of a workers' education man. Well, Spencer used to come and visit the school every summer. One night, we had some kind of a campfire outside, a  (?)   singing, and Spencer Miller talked, and he talked and he talked (laughing).  I saw one after another of these girls who couldn't take it any longer, would lie back and have themselves a little rest.  And next morning, one of the girls came up to me.  She said, "May I ask you a question?" And I said, "Yes." And she said, "Now, that Mr. Miller, is he for the people or against the people?"  She couldn't make out what he'd said. (laughing)  But a person like Frank--Mary Barker used to 29. be greatly admired.  She was a nice, down-to-earth --she was a middle-aged woman at that time; she must have been in her fifties, like that.  But there was some kind of a genuine quality.  Another person, who wasn't southern, was Pearl Willett .  She was a New Yorker, who helped to raiseshe was the treasurer, or chairman, of the finance committee of something for many years.  She used to shake a lot of money out of the well-to-do Jews (?) who wanted to support good things.  Well, Pearl was a genuine person, no great put-on or anything, down-to-earth.  When she used to come to visit, she used to come and stay sometimes a week.  There was a kind of recognition of basic quality there.  Those were, what you might call --certainly, Pearl would be an upper-middle class liberal. She was not an academician as some of them were who came. Then this friend of mine from Chicago, Lillian Herstein used to teech at Bryn Mawrused to come down just for the heck of it about every other summer and stay a few days.  But she was a little Jewish woman, about so high, with a booming voice and full of stories, you know.  The students used to lie down and wait for her to walk over them (laughing). Roydhouse:  What about Mrs. Otey? What sort of role did she have? 30. MacDonald:  Mrs. Otey was a . . .  had a very good relationship.  She was a little more formal than these other people, with the exception of Spencer Millerhe was most formal.  Mrs. Otey came; always spent a few days, sometimes longer. The students like her very much.  But she was not the kind of person temperamentally, who told the jokes, razzed around a little bit with them.  But they had great respect for Mrs. Otey because they recognized a basic core of friendliness, interest that she had in them. Roydhouse:  There was one person that was important for the League, that I think was at the Southern Summer School.  That was Mary Cowper from Durham. Now, she wasn't always; she was from Kansas.  She was the executive secretary of the League for a long time.  At one stage in her papers, it seems theb she visited the Southern Summer School.  It didn't seem to me, from the Southern Summer School papers, that she taught there. MacDonald:  I don't believe that she taught there. Roydhouse:  Do you remember her? MacDonald:  I don't remember her, but the last years of the school I was not there except once or twice.  I wasn't there on the regular teaching staff; I came back for a visit. It's quite possible she visited but I don't 31. believe that she ever had a teaching chore at the school. Roydhouse:  It would have been right early on; it would have been in one of the first years of the school. So you don't remember whether she visited or anything? MacDonald:  No, I don't remember at all.  That name doesn't . . . Roydhouse: . . . ring a bell. MacDonald:  Miss Gertrude Weilher name rings a bell. Roydhouse:  Can you remember back her connection with the schoolMiss Weil's connection? MacDonald:  She didn't have, so far as I know.  She may have had some connection but she was not visibly connected. Roydhouse:  Okay.  What about Alice Baldwin? MacDonald:  Now, Alice Baldwin was interesting.  She used to (I think I'm correct on this, yes I think she) used to help recruit, interview and talk with the students. And I can't remember if she ever came to the school.  But she was a friend of the school and was a person who helped on certain kinds of things.  I'm a little vague, as you can see, on that. Roydhouse:  Well, what about when the women came to the school? From the scrapbooks it seems that they did gain 32. quite a bit of awareness of their position in the social orderor however you want to term it.  When they came, did they have any sense ofI don't want to use 'class consciousness '--any sense of the difference between them and other people in the community, at all? MacDonald:  I don't think so, in the technical sense of class consciousness.  Maybe I can illustrate this best by referring to Ruby Clodfelter, who came from Winston-Salem, who had had just a typicalI doubt if she had gone more than the sixth or seventh grade, practically no education but a very intelligent and a very able personality.  Ernestine Freidmann (was her name clipped?)  she was very closely associated with Jane Smith in all of her activities . . . Roydhouse:  Yes. MacDonad:  One summer, at the Bryn Mawr summer school, Ernestine took somebody in Bryn Mawr town and invited her to tea or something and they invited these girls over. Ernestine was the person, you know, who was the kind of sub-hostess; she took the girls in.  And they had girls from the east side of New York, the bushy haired girls with all the rest of them.  And Ernestine told me later, she said, "You know, you ought to have been there."  She said, "These girls, who had never been in this kind of a house before, 33. were a little awkward.  Ordinarily they know their way around and so forth, but they just didn't know exactly . . They were out of place, they felt out of place.  But she said, "This Ruby Clodfelter had put herself on a dress with a little lace collar, and she just walked in there and she stepped around and she acted as if she was the queen of the palace." Well, Ruby Clodfelter never had a sense of being a down-trodden worker.  And I think that the bulk of southern workers back in these days .... I think that maybe that is not true of the textile workers because they lived in isolated communities.  But, for example, the tobacco workers in Durham and whereever else (?)                             , they were a part of the communi- ty, they were part of the churches, they were part of the organized activities of the town.  And I don't think there was ever a sense of a sharp line between those who have and those who have not.  Now, that would not be true of the black people, because the line there has been drawn; everybody knew it was there.  As a matter of fact, some of these people had very good lineage.  Take the Gregory family from  (?)      to Helen Gregory.  Her people were good revolutionary stock. Roydhouse:  And she knew it? MacDonald:  She knew it.  Helen was as good as anybody ever came down the line.  She didn't have a nickel and she 34. didn't get an education but nobody was any better than she was.  You know, this was never^expressed feeling but I think it was an inward feeling of confidence. Roydhouse:  The reason I asked the question was, I suppose reading Liston Pope or other people, they talk about the textile mill people having a sense of inferiority. And sometimes I read in some of the autobiographies from the Southern Summer School, some of the women, say, conscious of being called 'lintheads* or something, and mill people being different, and objecting to being made to feel inferior. It was more or less a  (?)   . . . MacDonald:  Well, I think that applies only to the textile workers, who lived in these segregated company com-munitites.  I can remember when I was a child in the small town where I grew up, there was a mill, an old cotton mill that was one of the ones that was built right after the Civil War to give the poor whites work, and it was just about gave (?) the poor whites work.  Now it__",s a very fine mill, United States Rubber Company has taken over and they've sold the housees to the people.  There isn't the segregation that there was at one time.  But I can remember going up town on Saturday and you could recognize a mill worker because they literally had lint on their clothes.  And they all looked consumptive.  Now 35. there may have been a lot of them there that didn't look that way, and you didn't see them in the crowd.  But I can remember being, sort of, impressed with that when I was just a kid.  But I think these people who were in LDur-ham, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, these other towns, that lived up in the main part, didn't go to company churches, didn't go to company schoolsI don't think they had any feeling of being deprived within the community, except maybe as poor people.  But in terms of this class business, I don't think they had much feeling about it. Roydhouse:   What do you think, then, the Southern Summer School did to them? Did it change any? MacDonald:  Well, I don't think we did much to change their class.  Really, I think we gave them tools for doing an awful lot of thoughtful work.  Some of them did, and some of them didn't, of course.  I remember once, one of my colleagues at the University, came down.  He was driving down to New Orleans on some kind of a visit, and he stopped by and he was interested.  He was a friend of mine and he was interested in the school.  In a very general way he was an historian.  He came to my class one day, and I don't know how we got into this, but we were talking about their work, and the things that they made were sold and they were sold for profit, and somehow or other the money flowed in. 36. What happened to the money? And they began to discuss from their vantage point what happened to the money that their products brought into the company till.  And we did a very nice little informal job of corporation finance without using any technical terms.  And     (?)    , this friend of mine came out later, and said, "This is the most class conscious thing I've heard in many a day."  But it wasn't couched in any terms.  These girls know an awful lot about what is going on from their viewpoint.  What the cross-section of the industrial workers in the South feel now, know.  In the communities where there were these sharp industrial conflicts, in Marion for instance, there was very great bitterness for a number of years.  I went back to Marion a couple of times after the whole thing was more or less over. The union was broken and so on. The people that I talked to, some of them had been in the summer school.  They were bitter, frustrated, and could find no way out. Roydhouse:  I did read some of the letters that, who was it, Grace Elliott, wrote back to the school.  Can you' tell me about Marion, about the school and Marion? Of course you were right there and there were so many people from Marion. MacDonald:  You see, Marion is at one end of a county-- 37. I think it's Mitchell Countyand it's a sort of over.* farther northwest.  There's a little town called Burnsville, and that's where we had this little mountain school. The equipment to build it was there.  And Burnsville was the county seat of Mitchell County. Roydhouse:  Oh, I didn't know that. MacDonald:  And it was way offyou know, it was forty miles from a railroad.  It was way back in the backwoods, but it's a darling little town, lot of nice people there. In the course of the Marion strike, an injunction was issued, a temporary restraining order, and listed people that were covered by the injuction.  There were about twenty or thirty people who were listed by name and then there was, 'all persons whosoever . . .' something like that. There were three people from summer school whose names were on that injunction.  Well, when the time came to have a hearing as to whether the injunction should be made permanent or not, that hearing was at the Burnsville courthouse, right down the hill from where the summer school was.  Well, Grace Elliott and Minnie Fisher , I forgot the third . . . Roydhouse:  . . . Rosa Holland? MacDonald:  Rosa Holland, I guess.  Those were the three people who were named.  And they said, "Why don't we 38. go down?"  Well, I thought it would be a good idea.  So the hearing was going to be, let's say, ten o'clock in the morning.  So we'd had a class, a brief class, the usual nine o'clock session, and I had explained a little bit about what the injuction was and what this hearing was about. And I said, "You people must be quiet, otherwise we may be put out of the courtroom."  I said to Grace, I said, "Grace, don't you go down and get up shouting about anything.  We're there to listen and learn from what's going on here.  So listen, then we'll come back and we'll have a session on it."  So we disbanded and they all went down to the hearing.  I went down a few minutes  later. When I got in the courthouse, went to the courtroom, here in the front seat, right straight across there were all the Southern Summer School students with their tablets and their pencils. . . Roydhouse:  Poised MacDonald:  Poised to take notes (laughing).  And the judge looked around , he was fin^-name was Judge McNair, he was a nice little ole Scottishmanhe looked over his glasses. But they were quiet, they were waiting to see what was going to happen.  I'm not sure that the judge knew that two or three people there were named in the injunction, but their manner, their behavior, was exemplary.  And the attorney for the company moved that these people be removed 39. from the courtroom.  And I sort of held my breath cause I thought if they try to remove some of these people, they'd resist, in spite of my admonition.  The judge looked around and they were all quiet, they were all nicely dressed and slicked up, and he said, "Well, I don't think these young ladies are doing anything that disrupts this court. We shall proceed." Well, he did make the injunction permanent but he didn't put us out.  I had never heard such a poor presentation.  The lawyer that the union hadIt was all I could do to keep from getting up and making the case for him.  He didn't know anything about injunction law. Roydhouse:  He was from Charlotte, wasn't he? MacDonald:  I've forgotten his name was . . . uh . . . Roydhouse:  I know what it is. MacDonald:  But he had had no experience and he just was one of those people who would take a labor case. Roydhouse:  Why did he do.that? MacDonald:  I don't know.  I never saw him again.  I tried to speak to him at this time, but by the time that I got around to getting my flock together he had caboosed. Peterson is the name that I remember, but I don't think that was the right name.  They had an awfully poor presentation in the court to sustain their position.  Because at that 40. time, incidentally, there had been no violence at Marion. The violence came at later times. Roydhouse:  Yes.  Were you involved in Gastonia at all? MacDonald:  Not except as an observer.  I went up there once during the strike and then I attended the trial as an observer, but I was not in any official capacity there.  But I was present to watch the famouse incident when the effigy, the wax figure of the chief of the police, was brought in with bullet holes. Roydhouse:  That's when one of the jurors went . . . MacDonald:  Yes, the wife of the slain policeman fainted and the daughter had hysterics.  You know, there was a show on the Broadway stage about that time, called "The Trial of Mayor Doogin", which had the same kind of thing where they brought somebody in ; this Portia, this very skilled woman lawyer, brought the figure in and proved by the angle of the bullet, or where the bullet hole was, that the person who had been accused was not guilty.  But in this instance, the judge, Judge Earnhardt, and he did I thought I very fine job of maintaining order in the court and kind of an even hand.  But he was absolved of some of the responsibilities       (?)     . At that time, I am not sure whether North Carolina law has been changed, but they did not have alternate jurors and one of the 41. members of the jurythat might react to this very tense kind of thingone of the members of the jury went berserk. And that meant that you had to have a mistrial. Some enterprising reporter got busy and polled the allegedly sane members of the jury, and he discovered that none of them ...  . You see, they had, I think eleven people three women and men and under North Carolina law it was mandatory if they were guilty, the whole eleven of them were executed.  Death penalty was unavoidable if guilty. And most of, I think it was a majority, of the eleven remaining jurors that were polled, they said that they couldn't under the evidence, they could not have sent eleven persons to their death.  So the state changed; it released all but three people.and then made the allegation second-degree murder. Roydhouse:  Did you know Fred Beal at all? MacDonald:  I just met him.  I knew the local man that was involved in that case, a man named Red Hendricks. And his wife, the summer after this, was at the summer school;  I've forgotten what her first name was.  Red Hendricks was ... do you have the name? Roydhouse:  I can't find it.  No I can't find it but it ought to be here someplace. MacDonald:  Well, the people that were held were found 42. guilty of second-degree murder.  They jumped bail and went to the Soviet Union.  When I was in the Soviet Union, some summers later, I met some Russian people who said that the trouble with people like Fred Beal who had come over there,they didn't want to work.  You see, the Soviet Union took them in and expected them to . . . Roydhouse:  Carry on MacQonald: . . . carry on and earn their board and keep as it were.  And said people like Fred Beal, Fred Beal wanted to be hot-shot politicians immediately.  So they didn't think very much of them .  And eventually he came back as you probably know.  Red Hendricks came back.  Red Hendricks didn't know which end was up.  You know, he was an untutored little old Gastonia textile worker's worker. And he got involved in the strike and was, I guess, one of the young militant people.  He must have been in his early twenties   (?)   .  And he skipped to the Soviet Union and he got over there and he was homesick.  His father was ill, an old man, and apparently the son was very devoted to his father.  The life over there, everything was just wrong. He wanted to come home.  So some people got busy and helped him come in, come back.  And I know the person who had arranged that when he got back to New York and got off the boat on this phoney passprt, he was to come to this 43. apartment and hide out for two or three days so that those tracks would be left.  He wasn't going to start right out for North Carolina.  And he made his way, from where he'd docked, to this apartment and he had been there for hours when the federal marshalls came. So that there was a leak along the line.  And he was immediately taken back to Raleigh.  In the meantime, he had developed tuberculosis.  I guess they finally released him.  I've forgotten what the last chapter was.  That was a very sad story about a young person who just got mixed up with something and was over his head.  In contrast, you know, Fred Beal came back and he came back attacking the unions, the Soviet Union and the communists and so on.  He stuck around for months and months and the federal officials didn't do anything about it.  Went up to New Bedford ; he came from somewhere up in that New England textile region. I guess eventually they got him, but he was writing for for the newspapers, writing for the Hearst papers, making all kinds of noise in the world and nobody bothered. But little old Red Hendricks got it in the neck immediately. Roydhouse:  Can you tell me about the relation between the Southern Summer School and the affiliated schools. (?)        .  Can you tell me why? MacDonald:  Well, the affiliated schools was Jane Smith's brainchild.  They thought that by having this 44. kind of holding company would be an exchange of information, communication, helping each other back and forth would be a very good thing.  I think Jane, who was sort of an imperialist, bless her heart, I think she thought that . . . as a matter of fact I think the original plan was that the holding company who administer the operating companies. I think the Bryn Mawr school went along with that.     (?) Shaw, which was Jane's business, I think they went along with it.  But Wisconsin and the Southern Summer School said no.  A loose kind of affiliation was feasible but control had to remain . . .  because Wisconsin said they were a state unit, they couldn't hand control over to another body.  Southern Summer School said we must retain control in terms of policy and the management of the affair.  Then I think Jane, and two or three other people who were promoting this idea this affiliation operating everything, they backed off from that and they said we'll just have a loose kind of a federation with autonomy in the various units. The Southern Summer School then went into it.  I'm not sure there was many very obvious and visible benefits one way or the other because the affiliated school, as time went on, became a much more sort of generalized business and workmen's education rather than attaching its activities to a particular unit. 45. Roydhouse:  So you don't think you lost out on anything by not belonging? MacDonald:  No, I don't.  It wouldn't have worked out any differently I think. Roydhouse:  The other thing that I was interested in was, in the schools and with you personally did you ever feel the need to distinguish between where to put your loyalty (?) on one side or the other:  on one side the labor movement and the other hand the woman's movement? (?) Did you ever feel much dichotomy there? MacDonald:  Well, I never felt much dichotomy mostly because I'm not a very good feminist, you know, in any vocal sense.  I never joined up with any of the groups. If I had been in a different kind of a business I think I would have joined up with the League of Women Voters , but in New Ygrk that was so far away.  These other interests of mine seemed close at hand.  But I wouldn't join anything just to be part of a woman's group, although I can see that there are certain benefits in a waycertainly in terms of equality, of opportunity and education.  But somehow or other my lines, maybe by the accident of what happened, I'd just gone up different alleys.  So I never had any feeling about it.  If anybody had felt very strongly on the women's question they should have troubled with the 46. labor movement because it's so male dominated. It hasn't changed an awful lot, so far as I can see though I'm less in touch than I was ten years ago. Roydhouse:  Well, what about the school? Why did you decide to have only women in the Southern Summer School? MacDonald:  Mostly because we had the contacts with the women and you know it did become co-educational later on.  But at the time we started out we figured the thing to do was to bite off a little that you could manage and there were these ways by getting hold, by getting contact, with the industrial women.  We didn't have any comensurate sorts of things to get hold of men. Roydhouse:  Well, what about the position of the Y.W.C.A.? MacDonald:  Well, as time went on the Y.W.C.A.*s influence I guess was less than it was at first, although I think right to the end these local industrial clubs continued to be kind of a recruilting area. Actually, at the present time, the Y.W.C.A. is less involved in its industrial . . . Roydhouse: . . . goings. MacDonald:  It really pioneered in this area back in the 1920's.  But now it has branched into the ... I  don't know too much about it.  But Eleanor Copenhaver Anderson succeeded Louise McLaren after Louise resigned from the Y.W.C.A. and took on this school as a full-time activity. 47. Eleanor was the person who was the southern representative. She was always interested and used to come to the school and diddle around.  Now she is no longer, she is retired a good many years ago.  And the program of the Y.W.C.A. I don't think has this . . . they used to have this autonomous assembly of the industrial workers and an autonomous student assembly, I guess business and professional was an autonomous group.  I think they had a little difficulty both with the students and the industrial people because they felt their autonomy and wanted to go a little further than mama's at the top thought was proper. Roydhouse:  At the Southern Summer School do you think the question of woman's place in the world, or however you wanted to define it, was an important question for IGesewomen as much as their position in the labor force? MacDonald:  I don't think it was.  I think that might have been primarily because of the orientation of the summer school's program.  But I don't think they had much of a sense of a separation of their problems of their functions from the point of their work as against sex. Roydhouse:  Do you think there was any sort of feeling of the sisterhood of women? You know, any think that they were different from men in any way, that they had different 48. problems? MacDonald:  I don't, I'm not sure that everybody would agree, but I don't think there was much feeling about that. I think it was solidarity, but it was the solidarity of workers in so far as there was a conscious feeling of solidarity. Roydhouse:  What about voting? Did you encourage the women to vote? MacDonald:  Well, we used to talk about it occassionally but we didn't have any specific program that would say, now when you go home you should vote.  But implicit in the whole business was that one of the ways that you do something about these conditions is by legislation.  And you first of all have to get the legislation passed and then you have to have it enforced. Roydhouse:  Well, what about working for legislation? Was there any program whereby the girls were going to go back into the community and try and get labor legislation? MacDonald:  Well, I think in the local areas where there were groups , and the Y.W.C.A. as a whole was very busy with all kinds of social legislation during this time.  And I think that these industrial groups became a part of that.  But I don't believe that the industrial groups so far as any kind of stimulus that the summer schools might have given them, I don't think that they 49. felt that as a separate kind of thing. Roydhouse: Can you recall anything at all about the fight in North Carolina for shorter hours for women? You know, the elimination of night work.  The League of Women Voters and through the legislative council of North Carolina were trying to get this passed , and they were the subject of daily   (?)   and   (?)   as well. MacDonald:  Most of that took place after I was out of the state and I know very little about it.  But I know, as a matter of fact, the federal child labor laws came in the early twenties.  I think both ... I know that Hamer versus Dagenhardt, the second of those cases, was a North Carolina case.  And I went and interviewed Dagenhardt. Roydhouse:  Oh, really? BEGIN SIDE I TAPE II MacDonald: Mary   (?).  I think I gave her a cop_y of it. Roydhouse:  Oh, good.  I'd be interested. MacDonald:  That's just sort of a human interest kind of thing.  And on this business of the child labor, we had a student from Macon, Georgia one summer, do you have her nameNora McManus? Roydhouse:  There are quite a few. Yes. 50. Steigerwald she is now. MacDonald:  This is Nora McManus.  She said that when the first child labor law was passed, she was working she was seven years old--she was working with her mother in the mill.  Her mother was a spooler and Nora got a dollar a week, or something like that, for handing the spools or doing some little item.  And an inspector, a federal inspector,came in and found this child in the mill and sent her out; she couldn't work anymore.  Then this case went, Atkins versus Children's Hospital case, before the Supreme Court and the child labor law was declared unconstitutional. So Nora went back to work.  Then the people who were agitating for federal child labor laws got another one, based on the taxing power of the Congress and that was the Dagenhardt case; Hamer versus Dagenhardt was the title of that case. And Nora was back at work after being taken out once, and an inspector under the second child labor law came in and she was still under fourteen, and she was working.  So they took her out again.  So,the law was declared unconstitutional the second time so she went back to work.  So she was a victim, perhaps I shouldn't say thatshe was involved with both of those statutes , still less than fourteen years of age. Roydhouse:  She went to Russia, did she not? 51. MacDonald:  No, I don't think so. Roydhouse:  I thought she'd gone. MacDonald:  Unless this was long after I knew her. Roydhouse:  Because I just came across her name later on when she'd (.married. MacDonald:  She may have married somebody.  I've lost touch with her over the years.  But she was from, maybe Georgia, one of those large industrial cities. Roydhouse:  Do you think there was any relation at all, any connection at all, between people who were working for protective labor legislationlike the League of Women Votersand the people they were trying to help? They ever connected? MacDonald:  I don't think there was really very much connection.  I think that most of the people in the League of Women VotersI guess they were people like Harriett Elliott.  You know, people of very godd will.  But this whole business here was just an untold story.  I remember when I was working on the night shift in Atlanta.  I lived in, what was called, the Church Home for Girls.  That was a place where girls who came in to work would be safe and. so on.  When I first went to work in the mill I made about three dollars and a half a week, and. according to the Church Home for Girls' regulationyou went in and you got 52. a place to stayyou paid half of what you made for your board, for your place to sleep.  And you got two meals a day and you could fix up some sandwiches and take with you for the third meal.  It was pretty lousy accomodations but one half of $3-50, you know, even in 1924 was quite a lot of board and room for what I was paying for.  Well, there was a very nice woman who was active in the Church Home for Girls and was very interested in this industrial project in Atlanta.  Her name was Mrs. McEutcheon (?).  I stayed there for two or three months in the Church Home for Girls; it was a lousy place.  It was full of bedbugs and the food was terrible; I mean it was horrible.  I had to go home and sleep during the day and then get up and go to work. I got sick and had to quit.  I was hanging around for a few weeks, and Mrs. McEutcheon said that the committee that operated the Church Home for Girls was going to have a meeting and would I come and talk to them about what it was to live there? Of course my wages had gone up to seven, eight dollars, so I was paying a little bit more.  But I went to talk with them, and I wasn'tat least I don't think, I don't know what I was in those days butI'm usually not a very beligerent sort of person.  But I was telling them that the standards of living , of cleanliness, of fairly decently prepared food was rellly what none of them would 53. have.  These were upp^-crust women,  And that they needed to look into the housekeeping.  And I said that the more important thing is this, I said, as poor as the accomodations were, I did not pay my way.  I got morewhat I got cost more than what I paid.  And I said, somebody had to subsidize them.  And I said, "You, ladies, are subsidizing these low paid five-and-ten cent stores, the workmen's candy, where they pay the girls nine or ten dollars a week and they can live, although poorly." And I said, "It seems to me that your efforts would be very much more substantial and long-run, if you would improve the conditions of employment for these people instead of making it possible for the girls to live on these substandard sweatshop wages."  That nearly blew the roof off them.  And as I said, I don't think I was  speaking in any sharp, belligerent way because this was my usual manner.  But they were just shocked to death, that anybody would think that they were subsidizing.  I may have said they were partly responsible if these girls would come in from out of town and live in these church homes and managed to scrape by on these sweatshop wages.  Something was wrong. Arid I said, "You ought to do something about that first." I'm not sure whether they ever did anything about it or not, but I left.  Unfortunately, you know, you don't go back on your 54. tracks much. Roydhouse:  Do you think that same sort of attitude would have been the same in North Carolina? MacDonad:  I suspect it might have been.  I don't know the . . . for some reason I didn'texcept for Miss Elliott who was very active in the League of Women Voters I didn't know any of those people.  I knew Miss Gertrude Weil by reputation because she was a very well-known person and also she was a very good, friend of the school, and I met her a few times.  I have a feeling that they were just uninformed.  They were like these ladies in Atlanta. I mean they were shocked to death. Roydhouse:   ... to hear what it was like. MacDonald:  Not so much to hear what it was like, but my comment that the providing of a place for girls to live where they raised money to subsidize the home, and the girls didn't make enough money to pay for what they got.  You see, that little economic jab just upset them no end.  So I think that somehow or other ther has to be an experience or a very vivid imagination that people who live this, more or less, sheltered kind of existence. You know, when the summer school was in the Ashville area which it was most of the timethere was a very fine woman doctor in Asheille, Dr. Louise Ingersoll.  And what she 55. did the first week after we had assembled, she gave each of the girls a general physical examination and recommended what to do.  I remember talking to Dr. Ingersoll once, after she had finished.  We had had about, oh, approximately thirty to forty people there.  She said, "In all of my years of practice, I have never seen such an accumulation of physical disabilitiesnot serious enough for people not to continue to function."  But she said, "They have curvatures, .  , they have malnutrition."  She went through a whole string of them.  Well, some of them may have been congenital, I don't know, but it was the close down to it living and the kind of work .  And I think that the upper middle class\don't see much of it unless something happens that brings it right home to them. Roydhouse:  There was one woman, Olive Tilford Dargan. Do you know who I mean? MacDonald:  Yes, I know her name. Boydhouse:  Now, she wrote a couple of novels about the people who live in the mountains and the same people who were working in the mills.  I wondered whether you knew whether she actually ever had very much contact with these people? MacDonald:  I don't know.  I've read what she's written.  Have you ever read, To Make My Bread by Grace Lumpkin? Roydhouse:  No I haven't.  Grace Lumpkin, I've heard 56. of. I know she's been interviewed but I haven't read that at all. MacDonald:  Well, you should read that.  Grace, at the time that she wrote that, was a hot shot commie, now . has about-faced.  At times past she's given testimony to the House UnAmerican Activities Committee.  I wouldn't have done that if they'd drawn and quartered me, but she .... You know, to be a fanatical communist requires the same mental situation as to be a violent anti-communist. There's a certain fanaticism, extreme whatever it is.  But the major portion of this novel by Grace is, I think, the best thing I've ever read.  It's about the mountain people, mountain families, that came down out of the hills into the industrial community.  And that part of the book, I think, is superb; and it only begins to run kind of crazy when they get all of this superstructure at the end of it.  But if you can.find it . . . Roydhouse:  I think it must be available. MacDonald:  It must be in some library there.  It didn't get very big circulation actually but it came out in the 1930's when there were a lot of books of that kind coming out. Grace has gotten the Gorky prize as being-whatever year, I've forgotten the year it was published best proletarian novel of that year. Roydhouse:  I did look at some of the things of Myra 57. Page (?). MacDonald:  Well, Grace is much better than Myra Page. Roydhouse:  You said you went to Russia yourself; when did you go? MacDonald:  I guess it was the summer of 1937.  I spent three months over there. Roydhouse:  Why did you go? MacDonald:  I wanted to see what it was like  (?), and I was ready for some new sort of experience.  I thought it was a significant thing whatever one might say about it.  So this friend of mine (who is liable to come in most any minute here), she and I went together.  And we got ourselves a Russian teacher so that we could read the street signswe couldn't discuss philosophy in the Russian language but we could get around by ourselves. Roydhouse:  And were you allowed to go around by yourselves? MacDonald:  Oh, yoah, we went around by ourselves. We were told we wouldn't be permitted to, but the first day we landed at Leningrad we were told that when you registered at the hotel they take your passportwhich was true and then if you were seen anywhere else, be picked up, they'd say Where's your passp^ort you can't be running around here without your passport so they'd take you back to your hotel. 58. So we got in the middle of the morning and got ourselves straightened out, went downstairs into the lobbywe were in one of these old kind of mid-Victorian velvet things you know that the Soviets had not replaced; if you'd give a crack the dust and moths and everything would come out (laughing).  So, we were sitting around in this lobby and we said, we've got to go out and see this town.  And there was a great big man at the revolving door, a great big-must have been eight feet tall with a Siberian costume. And something happened, he went somewhere in the back, and while he was gone we just walked out the door.  So we walked as fast as we could until we turned the corner, and across the street there was a park.  So we went over there and sat, and we said, "Why doesn't somebody come get us and take us back?" (laughing)  In those days, and I suppose the same thing is true now, you were very conspicuous because of your clothes.  And I had a pair of two-toned oxfords, black and white you knowvery comfortable walking shoes.  And I had those on and everywhere I went the people would stop and look.  Well, we practically stopped traffic. And we had no trouble.  We went on some of the tours.  And we had a friend who had been teaching in the Y.W.C.A. in China and when she was coming home, she came through the eastern corridor , stopped off in Moscow.  And she met up 59. with some people that she had known and she stayed over there.  She taught English.  And then I had another friend who used to teach up at the Brooklyn Labor College who was teaching English to the Red Army officers.  So we had a few contacts there. We went to all kinds of places with May    (?) is she on your list?  Well, May introduced us to some   (?) and her room mate wanted to improve her English so she offered to sort of be our interpreter.  I went to see the trade union people and all sorts of people, not planned at all except as we could plan it.  And Marie would go along-some of these people spoke broken Englishand Marie would be the translator.  We went to people's courts, you know, we just appeared.  There'd be usually three or four or maybe five of us, and we would appear.  We went to the hostels where peasants from the outside that had business in the city come in.  We spent an evening, you know, just sort of sitting around.  We were never ... of course we didn't try to crash the gates of the Kremlin and we didn't try to take pictures.  We had a Kodak with us but when we we went into an industrial establishment we didn't make any to-do about it.  We kept very scrupulously within the law of the country.  We had no problems whatsoever. Roydhouse:  How did you feel about it? Were you impressed? 60. MacDonald:  Well, I was impressed with certain accomplishments.  I don*t think I'd like to live there.  This friend of mine who lives here with me is a graduate of the famous child development institute of Columbia University. And she was very much impressed with the child care institutions, and we saw enough of them.  She saw enough of them; she did a little more of that kind of thing than I did.  She was let   in.  Marie just took her in  a lot of places, so it wasn't . . . Roydhouse:. . .  wasn't planned or anything. MacDonald:  Sort of a Victorian village type of place.  I thought it was a very interesting experience.  We travelled down south and went round through the Black Sea. We were at Yalta.  As a matter of fact we stopped at another onewe were on a boat for about five days.  It was a freight boat, and when it stopped we were permitted to get off, go in through the towns.  And one of the nights, late afternoon, the captain said we'd be there for three hours; and he said, "Be sure to come back.  In the middle of this, if the lights go out, there's going to be a blackout tonight, and if you are out in the street move to the wall.  Move next to the house and stand still.  Don't try to get yourself anywhere."  So we were out in this someplace or other, and everything did go, completely blacked out.  We just moved over against the house, stood there for about ten 61. minutes and then everything went on. But we had no sense of a secret police looking over our shoulders.  And in contrast when we went out we went out to Poland (?), stopped in Berlin for a few days.  We had been told if you came through into Berlin through the east you weee likely to be bothered.  But it seemed to us that everywhere we wentwe liked to do just plain walking around in the city, window-shopping, looking around at the people; I'd been in Berlin before and had sort of forgotten the lay out of the landand it seemed to us that everywhere we went there was a man in uniform looking right behind us.  We stayed for a couple of days and decided to go on because it wasn't quite comfortable.  Although the hotel that we stayed in (I've forgotten how we knew about this; it wasn't one of the big expensive places) but we got in and we didn't have any money.  We hadn't had anything to eat for a while.  The man at the desk said their dining room was closed, but he gave us money.  He was very helpful, you see.  He told us where to go, and we said, "No money," and he changed the money for us; he helped us.  He was really very very nice.  I suppose any official in a hotel has to be nice to guests. But we didn't have a very good feeling about being in Germany although we weren't there long enough and if we'd 62. gone out to the countryside it might have been different. Berlin was a very up-tight place, it seemed to us. Roydhouse:  It would have been ....
