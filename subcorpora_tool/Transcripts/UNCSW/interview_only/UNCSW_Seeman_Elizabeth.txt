 Mimi Conway: Today is February 19, 1976, and I'm with Elizabeth Seeman at Tumbling Creek, Tennessee. Elizabeth Seeman is a designer who also wrote two books, In the Arms of the Mountain. An Intimate Journal of the Great Smokies and a children's book called The Talking Dog and the Barking Man. But more than that, she has lived and built a wonderful life here in Tumbling Creek. Elizabeth, can you tell me where you were born and when you were born and a little bit about your early life? Elizabeth Seemani I was born in Chicago in 1904, May the second. Up in the southern end of Chicago near Lake Michigan. And I remember being taken to the lake to swim in little old-fashioned dresses with my four sisters. And I remember things when we lived there that my mother said I couldn't have remembered, that I just heard people tell about it. [Laughter] I was the fourth child, the youngest child, and I remember one of my sisters threw an iron train at my head, which didn't hit. And I did all sorts of odd things my other sisters didn't do in later life. When I think of the influences on my life, I can think of the tickets for the series of lectures to hear Scott Neering influenced me on the economic side of life, but I know that it's actually my pioneer ancestors that influenced me,and my Indian blood. When I told my mother that I was part Indian and largely Indian, she was astonished. She said, "Why, how did you get to be an Indian when nobody else in the family was Indian?" M.C.: [Laughter] Seemans And I said, "Oh, I know I am, because look how many years I've lived in the woods now. And not only do I live here, but I have to live here. I couldn't think of living anywhere else." So she was Seeman - 2 nonplussed.    And  I never would  go to  church when I was a child.     I refused  to go.    And  when I would  be away and  living in the city in the suburbs,  I would  be very unhappy because I wasn't in the right setting for myself.    And  I was a bad  child;  I fought all the other children and started  race riots and ran up one alley and down the next, and  that would be unthinkable for my other sisters.    And  my mother didn't even know what a career of evil I was going into.    [Laughter] M.C.s  But in fact, didn't you truly have pioneer.   .   .   .     Could you tell me a little bit about your .   .   . Seemans Oh,  yes,  I did have pioneer ancestors. M.O.:  Can you tell me a little bit about your mother's family, who I think you mentioned  were French settlers,  and  their names,  and a little bit then about your father's family and  the factual things. And  then after we can talk about the ancestors that you've adopted  for yourself. Seeman: [Laughter] Yes. My mother came from a very old pioneer family, and they came down the Ohio River on flatboats, and they were millers. And they became professional people, a lot of teachers and doctors. M.c.:  When did they come to this country,  and  what was your mother's family name? Seeman: Those were the Perrins, and the Perrins married into a German family called the Waldschmidts. And the Waldschmidts later changed their name to Walsmith, and they were among the earliest pioneers in Cincinnati when Cincinnati was just a fort; it was called Fort Seeman - 3 Washington at that time. M.C,: And  when was that,  about? Seemans This was before it was a city at all,  and  I don't know the exact date of it. M.C.:  How about your father's family? Seeman: And  my father's family was a very old  family,  but I don't have the history of them the way I have of my mother's family with the Walsmiths,  because the EAR took the old  house where the Walsmiths lived and they have made a plate with a decoration on it and  they have kept the furnishings in it.    It's up near                                      now. M.C: Did  you tell me that you have a relative on your father's side who you're not absolutely certain you're descended  from him, but you claim him as a .   .   . Seeman: Oh,  yes.    Oh,  that's right.     Dr.  Brickie came to this country in the very early days,  because he wrote a book called  Ante-Bellum North Carolina,  and  the ante-bellum refers to the Revolutionary War.    And he came up into this area when there were only Cherokees here,  and he wrote a very interesting and odd  journal.    Some of it was taken from someone else's work,  I understand,  but it was all in quaint,  early language and  a queer old  book with woodcuts of strange animals the way they thought they were in those days.    And  he talked about the Cherokee Indians and  the beautiful maidens and  the fine country. M.C.: And  that's where you think you got your Indian blood. [Laughter] Seeman:  Yes.    Probably so.    Undoubtedly so,  because the way he Seeman - ** described the Indian maidens was certainly more than normal interest. [Laughter] M.C.: And  his name was Dr.  John Brickie. Seemans Yes. M.C.: And your father's name was. . . . Seeman: William Henry Brickie. M.C: And what was your mother's name? Seeman: Anna Florence Perrin. Then her grandmother was a Koogler, and they came, and the Walsmiths and the Perrins intermingled back in there. M.C: Did you go to art school, or were you always artistic, or could you tell me a little bit about your early life, your living in New York, and your marriage? Seeman: I studied art, and my mother had studied art, and that influenced me undoubtedly. And when I went to high school I took the art course and worked for scholarships, and then I married an art student. We went to school together there, and neither one of us had been able to support ourselves before we married. And finally we went to New York to try to get more work, because . . . M.C: Was that after you lived in . . . Seeman: After Augusta, Kentucky, yes. M.C: Could you tell me a little bit about living in Augusta, Kentucky, and a little bit about him or what his name was? Seeman: My husband's father was a Presbyterian minister, but he had severe trouble with his eyes and had to give up his work. So we Seeman - 5 were immediately forced, before we could even support ourselves, to buy a house. So we went fifty miles from Cincinnati, way up the Ohio River to a small river town on the south side of the river, Augusta, Kentucky, where we were able to borrow the money and buy a small, small house by a railroad track. [Laughter] And there I realized that the Civil War was still alive in Augusta, Kentucky, and on the other side it had only been a matter of history to me. And in this old river town, the people still knew where the cannonballs rolled down the porch, and somebody was out and played "Yankee Doodle" so her property wouldn't be destroyed. And up in the graveyard were groups of soldiers that had died of cholera. History just came to life where the history of the South really began, and I realized that I really knew nothing about the Civil War than what I'd read in the books. And I realized that it was very much alive in the South. People remembered it because they had had troubles. M.C* Was this a small town? Seeman: A very tiny little town, yes. M.C: Did you tell me once something about the trains? Seeman: And from up on the graveyard hill, you can look down. As the coal trains came through the town, the train would be longer than the town, it had so many cars. But I was not conventionally religious, and I unfortunately didn't support my poor old father-in-law, who got a job as a Presbyterian minister again in this town, but I refused to go to church, which caused a great scandal, for the minister's daughter not to go to church. And furthermore, every time the steamboat whistle sounded around the bend, the door of the manse   would fly open, Seeman - 6 and out would rush the parson's son and his wife and younger brother, and run full gallop to the river to see the steamboat come around the bend. And I guess that caused considerable talk, too. [Laughter] M.C: Did you say that your feelings about religion were early? Seeman: When I was a very young child I refused to go to Sunday school, not because I reasoned anything out, but I just didn't like the atmosphere. And I was a sort of an individual and a real bad and dissatisfied child and went around fighting and having fist fights. And it seemed to me I didn't belong in such a virtuous atmosphere as the Sunday school. M.C: Then did you say that you and your husband, at the start of the Depression or before the start of the Depression, went to New York, both as artists? Seeman: We couldn't get enough work to keep even this little house and support his father and mother and young brother, so I thought we could get work in New York. And so I went with another girl who wanted to go to New York to study, and there I did get quite a lot of work, and I sent for my husband to come. M.C: Work designing. Seeman: It was  children's book illustrations I was going to get from Macmillan, and I had so much of it and I thought it was easy to do, because I just accidentally happened to get some when I first went. And I thought it would be a very fine place to get plenty of work, so many publishers there, and I wired my husband to come on. So they sold the house and broke up the poor minister's family. His mother went and became a housemother in her sister's school, and then the parson had to go to a rest home, and the young brother came to New York eventually. But just about that time the big Depression hit, Seeman - 7 so I lost all my work anyway, and there we were without any work, and the very successful people had lost their work, also. And a woman that had seven portraits planned to do had to give them up, because they had disappeared. And book contracts would disappear overnight. And there we were without any way to make a living, and jobs were absolutely impossible to get, and we lived in an old studio building on Fourteenth Street. And the gas and light was turned off, and finally we were put out of our apartment because we couldn't afford to pay the rent. The other artists gathered around and said that the thing to do was to go in a little office building where nobody was supposed to stay at night and live there, but never, never to get an apartment up in the upper part where you couldn't look out, because if you didn't have a window, you'd have claustrophobia. And they had all had problems, too. Our friends were put out of their apartments. They would go and sleep in somebody's bathtub. And we saw people sleeping on the streets on folded newspapers. And it was a very tragic, difficult time. M.C: Was it traumatic for you? Did it change you, or was it just a mere survival? Seeman: It changed anybody that lived through it. It was traumatic for anybody. And nobody ever lived through it without any scars from it. [interruption] Seemans New York was a fascinating place for me, having come from this small river town and a very conventional background. To find that there's so many things going on; the air was electric with things going on. There was a group of Martha Graham's dancers that was practicing Seeman - 8 or dancing in the room above our room, and we could hear the drums beating. And see all the gangsters lived around there, and the first black markets and the lectures and the schools and the concerts and the art galleries. And I went out to gobble down everything at once, almost. And the real New Yorkers who live there a long time never do that, because there's so much there that you can't do that M.C: Did you go to school there at all? Seeman: Yes.  I went to school. And we had very little money, but for fifty cents I could go to labor schools. I found the Rand School, and I heard that Rivera was making paintings, murals in a school ... M.C: Where was he making paintings? What was the school? Seeman: On Fourteenth Street, an old building up about the third or fourth floor in a rattletrap old building. M.C: What school was that? Seeman: That was the Communist Opposition, but it didn't matter to me. It seemed to me they were talking. ... So they asked for very little money, thirty-five cents or a quarter or something like that, that I could afford. M.C.: That's an odd name for a school, Communist Opposition. Seeman: They wanted to let it be known that they were a radical school, but they were not for communism. M.C j Did you mention something about Rivera not believing that a revolution would come to the U.S.? Seeman: He thought that so many democratic things went on in this Seeman - 9 country, and the average person had so much more than they have in other countries, and there was a strong democratic feeling here, that he felt that America would not have a revolution, that it would come peacefully, through the ballot. M.C: Did you mention that you sketched him, and could you tell me what he was doing when you sketched him? Seeman: He was painting on these murals, and he started with the beginning of the country, how the Indians were conquered by the blunderbuss and the liquor jug. And he showed that the Pilgrims had ruined them with liquor and with superior weapons, in other words. And then he went on and on, the democratic influence of Whitman and Marx. And he would paint the person who he considered to be the great personality of the period very large, and other people would be smaller, the events going around it in small groups of scenes. M.C: Did you say something about a mural of people on the loft that he painted? Seeman:He also was disgusted with the way the radicals would argue about points of ideology,  and  that they were tearing.   ...    He showed a scene on Union Square,  where they're all arguing.    They're pointing to books,  and  "This isn't so" and  "We have to do it this way";  "No, no, we have to do it some other way."    And how they were ruining the labor movement and the radical movement by all these discussions and splitting hairs over ways of doing things. M.C:  Is that the mural that you sketched  him doing? Seeman: I think the one I sketched  him doing,  he was working on one with Marx,  I think,  large, and  Lenin and other people around  and Seeman - 10 smaller events that went on in the revolution, and lines of soldiers marching. M.C: And did  you also mention that you went and  listened  to soapbox speakers and such? Seeman: I went everywhere over New York.    I went to as many lectures and   concerts,  and  I stood  up at the opera,  and  I went down to Union Square and  I listened  to soapbox orators.    About that time my sister and  her husband  sent us tickets to hear Scott Neering,  and he influenced  me greatly on economic affairs.    And  he,  in fact,  influenced the whole generation.     But not so much on his way of living,   because I had  that in me from the pioneer side.     I already wanted  to live that way.    But I appreciated  it.    I didn't know so much about how he was living,  but I knew that he was living out and  had  made his house and his gardens and all that.    But in New York when you go through the Depression and  have somebody come and  turn off your gas.   .   .    I remember the man that came to turn off the gas thought I was just a young girlhe didn't know I was marriedand  he said,  "Miss,  you're cooking something.    I'll come back later after you've finished."    And I said,  "Oh, no"I was going to be very heroic "just come and  turn It off now.     It doesn't matter,  because you have to do it.    It's your job;  you have to do it." M.C:  How many years did  you stay in New York? Seeman:  We lived  there about seven years.    And during this time I saw so many    horrible things during the Depression that it horrified  me with  big-city living from then on.    I always shudder when I think of New Seeman - 11 York, in a way, because I know it's a great city but I remember the suffering of people there and what an unnatural sort of life it is. Scott Neering himself said it was like living In a maggot heap. But I was horrified by the life of the people, running like rats through the subways. And the tall buildings.  I had building fever; I couldn't live underneath a skyscraper.  When I was a student there as an art student for a while, I couldn't stand the feeling of the building above me. And the other people said, "Oh, this is a real thing.  It's a building fever you get." Then I saw the poor people down in the slums, sitting outside because they had nothing but dark apartments to be in. And at night they would sit in chairs out on the sidewalk. [interruption] M.C: Could you tell me why you left New York? Seeman: There we had come, as a minister's son and his. . . . And in this very conventional background, the small-town background, to New York, and we landed in the Village where it was so utterly sophisticated and wide-open on sex and liquor and everything, except I don't remember anyone using dope at that time. We both got completely out of work, but after looking and looking and looking I finally got a job in a greeting-card concern, a large department of beautiful girls, designers, and my husband refused to even try to get any work. But I got him a job in this place, and the designers, when they saw this handsome man, why, they swooped upon him, and of course one very fascinating lady made off with him. She was a real married man specialist. M.C: Did you say that he looked like Rudolph Valentino? Seeman - 12 Seeman: Yes. M.C: What is his name? Seeman: Charles Pringer, and his nickname was Chad. But he was so handsome that in Washington, where he studied art for a while, he wore a toreador costume, and he was mobbed by the people. They thought he was Rudolph Valentino. So this is a very dated story. M.C.: [Laughter] Seeman: But anyway,  he was so handsome that women just practically fainted when he came around,  and   I had  very little chance,in such a free and open system with no closed  season on husbands, of ever holding him.     Because  I had  awfully bad old  raggedy clothes,  since we couldn't get any work and we didn't have enough to eat.    And this girl had  finally captured  him when one of my friends said,  "Oh,  she's the most interesting girl I've ever seen.     She has seven pairs of gloves." M.C.: [Laughter] Seeman: Anyway, she knew her way around. And she finally captured my husband and made him think he was a prisoner of love. And she had been a nurse, and she knew all about all the 120 sexual positions, and how to have clothes made specially for her to bring out just the right curves and so on. And he said unless I had wonderful clothes specially made for me, I would just look like a homely boy in my old clothes.  Well, I said, "I am a distinguished person in my old clothes." I didn't give in an inch, and I wouldn't let him know I was brokenhearted. But about that time I met Ernest, who came along, and his wife had left him because he had lost his position at Duke. And she also had always wanted money, and he never had made enough to suit her, and so she said Seeman - 13 if ever he lost his position he would lose her. So she left him and he came to New York looking for someone, and through another friend we met. And we liked each other so well. We both found out we were interested in radicalism, and we both hated Mussolini, and we started walking all over New York together and going in little foreign restaurants. And about that time the work got so scarce. And I found a friend of mine had become an art director, and she called me. She gave me a chance to come and join the firm there, so I went and Ernest followed me. And as soon as we could get our divorces, why, we were married then in Chicago. And from there we took a six-month honeymoon down on the west coast of Mexico. And finally, when we came back from there, Ernest nearly died of a fever down there, and we came back into a Chicago blizzard. And I immediately found myself with a violent sore throat that lasted for three years, and finally a doctor told me that it was really from tension, because the only time I really felt well was when we'd go canoeing out on the Des Plaines , or I'd go horseback riding out in a park somewhere. Then my sore throat would go away immediately. Then I'd come back to the city.  He said, "That showsthe minute you come back to the city the sore throat starts again that you will have to get out of this place." So then this was a disaster financially, because all the money had been spent on doctors, going from one to another. But I realized in the back of my mind that "Disaster may be the very dynamite to blast you out of a place [to] where you want to go." Because by that time I knew, by the process of elimination, that I didn't want to live in a city. My pioneer ancestry and my Indian blood reasserted itself, and I knew that I wanted to live Seeman - 14 in a wild and beautiful and unspoiled place. And here was my chance, my psychosomatic sore throat. But it forced me out; I not only wanted to but I had to leave. So we decided we just wouldn't go a little way from Chicago in the country, but we'd go way off and pick a place that would be wild and beautiful. And we knew we didn't have the hardihood to tackle the north woods, because, as they say in British Columbia, "Courage is not enough." You have to have knowhow and youth and strength and know how to get along or you won't survive at all.  But the Smoky Mountains beckoned to us, because they were so beautiful and friendly and full of mystery. And, being the stumps of some of the most ancient mountains in the world, they naturally have a great deal of mystery and fascination. And so Ernest went down and found a mountain boy we used to know and travelled all around to find the place of our dreams that we had planned to get. And after he finally found it, I found out that he had not gotten a farm, as I had planned, so we'd have some sort of a shack to shelter us and an old barn and maybe some cleared ground. But he, the romantic male, had gone and picked a place right up near the government forest, with no garden area, no house, no anything. So then we were forced to borrow the money to build a small cabin. But then I had to wait till that was ready before I could come down. Then I came down with a few things, and when I got there we had two chairs, two army cots, a couple of skillets, and my drawing table and a few books, and fifty cents left over. And people wanted to know why we made such a rough beginning, but when you only have fifty cents left over it does make a little Seeman - 15 rough beginning. [Laughter] And there was a sort of a gray area there that I can hardly remember till I finally got reestablished and sent work into Chicago again and got the work back and forth by mail. And about that time World War II came along. And the mountain people were absolutely astonished that we would come and live way back up there to the woods and live in such a primitive way, and that we certainly couldn't be living near the state line and near a great government forest without the intention to slip over the line . . . M.C : [Laughter] Seeman: ... and that we certainly must be spies, or we would never have come here in the beginning. And decent people would have lived out on the highway to see the passing. And we didn't have a cornfield or a cow or a pig, and they considered our cabin a playhouse because it wasn't grim. It was too sort of playful and imaginative. [Laughter] And we had a lot of chickens we got, every one chosen for unusual specklings and different kinds of colors. And they laughed at us; they thought that was so funny. But the women came and showed me how to use the iron baker and how to cook in the pioneer way. And they also thought we were billionaires, because we couldn't be living here in the beginning, and nobody in his right mind would go way back in there. And all sorts of rumors flew. They were sure that we were spies and that's where we got all of this money. And every plane that came over was supposed to be dropping packages. And every drawing I sent off to Chicago had maps and spy material. And every birdhouse that we put up was a way of talking to Italy, Germany, or Japan. And It became a very dangerous situation, and word was sent to us we'd Seeman - 16 better leave, we were going to be burned out and my husband would be lynched and we wouldn't ever survive alive. But I let it be known I had a rifle, and I would protect him. M.C: Could you tell me a little bit about when they tried to lynch him? And also I think you mentioned that he had been a veteran himself from World War I. Seeman: Yes, he had been in the Navy himself, and they never did come to lynch him, because I think they actually were afraid, because I just let it be known somebody would be killed. And I was considered to be a very dangerous woman. The fact that I dared to go through the woods alone. And they said I was seven feet tall and carried a machine gun with me, and that we had buried bombs and we had all sorts of secret weapons. And I think they feared our "secret weapons," too. And the mountain people would come to see us and bring flowers and talk as friendly as could be, what they called "sweet talk." They would go away, and everyone would tell a different story. One boy, I got him to go up in our loft to look for something for me, and he said, "I seen your parachute." And I said, "What are you talking about?" M.C: [Laughter] Seemant And he said, "That great big leather bag back there." And he was talking about a heavy, round duffel bag for a canoe with heavy straps on it. And he said, "That's the parachute," and I said, "Oh, that has nothing of a parachute. Why, that would just go 'Clonk.' A parachute is made of the lightest silk; you can hardly keep it from blowing." And he would have gone off and told everybody about our parachute. But they didn't have to see anything. One cupboard door Seeman - 17 had no rollers to roll on; it could only be jerked back at great effort, and jerk, jerk, jerk. It was maddening. And they went off and told we had a secret door. We just pressed a button and it would go, "E-e-e-e-e-e" back. And behind there, in that cupboard, were the horrible-est you ever heard tell of. But each one embroidered on the story and told more and more about what it was. And just about when things got very, very serious, why, a well-balanced and sturdy, fine, handsome woman came over looking for her cows and found Ernest and me washing the dishes at the creek. And we became friends, and she said, "Law, I can tell good folks when I see them." And she went back and told them, "Why, those people are all right." Also the man from the FBI looked up our background and said, "You've got good neighbors there." But the fact we had been investigated by the FBI made us even more in disfavor. M.C.: Did you say that the FBI came . . . Seeman: Oh, they came from everywhere. They came from Asheville. They came from every town around, and from Erwin and from Johnson City, in contingents, and they came in groups. And they would send two at a time. And then they'd demand to see your credentials and so on, and where you'd been and where you were going and so on. M.C: Did they harass you a good deal? Seeman: Our mail was always suspect. The mailman checked our mail, and if we sent a radical paper to anyone he would go there and say, "Now, you shouldn't take that paper. These people are ..." M.C: Do you think that they were concerned about you because neighbors were saying you were German spies, or were they more sophisticated Seeman - 18 than that and actually checking you because they feared that you were radical? Seeman: They were actually checking us for radicals, and when they checked our mail they saw we got a vast array of all sorts of different magazines of every persuasion of thought, from the most radical to the most conservative. And one man at the FBI later told Ernest at the hospitalhe was at the Veterans Hospitalhe said, "They really couldn't get anything on you except that they said you read too much, and you wrote too many letters." And writing a lot of letters was considered very dangerous. M.C: And wasn't it true that also they got the idea that you were billionaires because of the postage? Seeman: Yes, no matter how much we had to eat, we always kept our literature going and got these magazines. And Ernest wrote a great many letters, and he would buy postage seven dollars' worth at a time. And one boy said, "Well, that old man's got money." He said, "You ought to see the stamps he buys." And we could not have hardly anything to eat, but Ernest would still keep the stamps going and still keep his correspondence going with all sorts of people. And they considered that very dangerous, to have such a wide range of interests. M.C:  Can you remember some of the magazines that you had  back in the days of World   War II? Seeman:  In the very early days we always got George Selding's paper,  In Fact.    And  then I.   F.  Stone's paper we always got.     We never got the Daily Worker,  but we got all sorts of radical papers.    And  then Seeman - 19 a friend of ours in Chicago who was interesteda retired doctorin helping people read better things sent us all sorts of radical things and all sorts of magazines of every kind.  He'd send fine expensive French and English magazines, and then he'd put in some radical things and the East German papers and all sorts of things. M.C: Were you red-baited, or did the FBI query about that? Seeman: We finally made friends with the people all around us, and they realized we hadn't done anything dangerous, but they always considered that we were communists, although we weren't. And they were always suspicious, and they would watch anybody that came to see us. They'd check up on the license plate of the car and how many people were in it. And one time a group of labor people from a factory district came to see us, and they brought their little children with them for a picnic. And this was considered a horrible invasion of the mountains by a whole group of people. And the fact that they had their children with them and came for a picnic didn't make it any better. The words flew around everywhere how all these strangers had come. And they BEGIN SIDE II TAPE I M.C: coming out and being by the creek. Seeman: This is    idea to try it. M.C.: Can you say something else, Elizabeth, so we can see how your voice sounds? Seeman: We just took the walk up to see where the house originally Seeman - 20 was, but I'm afraid it's so disappointing now. It's changed so much from the way it was originally. I really hesitate to take anyone up there, because I talked about it like a mountain paradise and then here it looks so commonplace and torn down, and the rhododendron beds are gone and the big hemlocks have been cut down, and so many things have changed. [interruption] M.C: Elizabeth just said, "Position abandoned." [Laughter] We love the creek, and we thought it would be very nice to tape it out here but on the tape it sounds like the Grand Coolee Dam, so we're going to go back inside and see if we can get a little better sound. [interruption] M.C: I wondered about the timing of your coming to Tumbling Creek, which you mentioned was just before World War II.  Were there political considerations involved in your decision to go to the country, to go to Tumbling Creek? Seeman: Not so much, except that after we came here we heard from our landlord in Chicago that the FBI had been there looking for us because we had signed a petition to put the Communist Party on the ballot. A communist friend, a young reporter, had come around and gotten us and as many people as he could to sign it, and we thought that they had a legal right to be on the ballot, so we didn't hesitate to sign it. I don't know what they would do, but they were certainly going to persecute everybody who signed that petition. But our landlord had been very fond of us, and he wouldn't give our names away.  He said we had left and he had no idea where we'd gone, so they were frustrated Seeman - 21 on that particular score. M.C: Good. Seeman: But later in the mountains, the neighbors kept reporting us as communists and reading too much and too many books and too many magazines, and if we did get anyone in the locality to subscribe to a radical paper, why, the mailman made it his business to go around and tell him not to take it and to let that magazine go, that that was a wicked magazine and they'd get in trouble if they read anything like that. And they were watching our mail, undoubtedly, and we heard later from a man in the FBIit was at the hospital when Ernest was there and he said, "Well, actually they never had anything on you except that you read too much and too widely." I said that once before on the tape. M.C.: That's okay. Elizabeth, you mentioned something about a library. Can you tell me when you started that, and can you tell me about the library? Seeman: I always had the notion that we would want to make our home a cultural center, and in Chicago I had been collecting children's books. And after I went away one year to work in Chicago to make money when we were so broke, I came back then and finished a children's book I had started in Mexico, The Talking Dog and the Barking Man. And I had part of it written, but I found I couldn't do it and hold a job, too. My eyes weren't strong enough. So here was my chance when I got home to work on that, and I couldn't do the illustrations because my eyes couldn't hold up, although I had some of them done, but I sent this manuscript around a great many places and it didn't sell. And I put it aside for a long time, and finally I saw in Writer magazine Seeman - 22 an international contest for Franklin Watts, so I entered it in that and it came in on one of the top five. And first thing I knew, I got a check for a thousand dollars. And here in the midst of starvation it was amazing. And I got to go to New York, and they had a wonderful editor there, Sarah Chokelin Gross, who helped me go over my manuscript and simplify the wording for the age group it was, because I knew nothing about that, taking out too many Spanish words and things that wouldn't be quite understood. And she did a marvelous job on it, and I happened to mention to her in the taxi, just as a brief conversation, that I had this little library, and she said she wanted to help build the library. And it turned out that she had had a little daughter who died, and she was bereaved to lose that child and wanted to help other children.  So she set to work, much to my surprise, and little packages of books started to come.  Fine new books and books from the publishers.  She had access to all sorts of wonderful books. And she, singlehanded, built up our library, until finally she got the idea that she would write about the Tumbling Creek library for Scholastic Magazine. And we thought nothing about that, because we thought it was just a little library magazine, but lo and behold, it went to every school library in the country. One day Ernest came back from the mailbox.  He said, "Why, there are two big cartons of books down there. Will you come down and help me carry them up?" So we took our sticks down and put them through, coolie-fashion, and toiled up the mountain, a mile up the mountain with our books. The next day there were three packages, the next day five, and pretty soon there were twelve. And we had to get a neighbor with a truck to come and help us. And then the Seeman - 23 house got so full of books, and I tried to mend them all. And some of them were brand new, but a good many of them were scuffed and worn. And I'd try to mend the broken corners and the torn pages, and then we started giving them away to the local schools. And they were overjoyed to get them, because they had tried to put on book drives and tried so hard to get books, and they had none. And so we'd take them there and they'd send the students out and unload the truck and carry them up to the library, and the teachers would divide them according to the age groups. Then the local childrenthere were seventeen children in our cove at that timeand they came up and borrowed books from the library. And I made shelves all over the house and put the little children's books down where they could reach them. And I would let them take several books at a time instead of one or two, and keep them much longer than the average library would allow. Then for the first time they saw shelves of books in a house as an integral part of the house, and it was so much more impressive than it would be just in a library off by itself. Then they became a status symbol, and they would go home and make their father build them a shelf. And I gave them duplicate books so they could have their own little library. We started little individual libraries all over the area. M.C: What kind of places did you put them in? Seeman: Well, just in mountain homes and where there were children going to school. And then I had a good many books that they could use that were reference. For their schoolwork, if they couldn't get anything, they would come and I would look up things to help them. And they would then carry off books on dinosaurs or whatever they were Seeman - 24 looking up. M.C: Up until what age? Seeman: The seventeen children in the cove were all ages, from little toddlers to high school age, almost, and whole troops of them would come up. It was a beautiful sight to see them carrying off books and flowers and things I gave them. And then I made cups of cocoa for them and put whipped cream on them, and they never had whipped cream on cocoa. I don't know whether they ever had cocoa or not. [Laughter] And then I had parties for them. I had a Halloween party and a Christmas party. And at Christmas we'd give them little bags of candy with pictures on them, and I had their names written on it. At that time they didn't have very much of anything, and they didn't have any books. And sometimes the parents didn't want them to waste time reading. And one man said to mehis wife was an exceptional person-he said, "Eileen can read like a Guinea a-gabblin', but I think it was a waste of time. I think she ought to just do embroidery and knitting and sewing and things like that." And she did like to do those things, but she loved books and she had a few novels. And I found out that the women had no cookbooks. And Irene was a wonderful cook, but she didn't have a cookbook either. And they just had a few little recipes they saved in an envelope, and I started giving cookbooks around. When the publishers would ask if they had any books that I wanted  slightly damaged or something, what kind would I want?then I always asked for cookbooks and books on help with mechanical things, household repairs. And one boy was interested in automobile repairing, and a librarian friend had been sending books. He and another librarian got to work, and they took a great big expensive book about automobile mechanics out and just marked it "Retired" and sent it to us. They Seeman - 25 said, "Well, nobody has asked for this book, and it was a valuable book." So I gave it to this boy, and he got started. And his mother said, "Well, he was going to buy a secondhand car that had certain defects, but the book said 'Unh-uh, don't get it. [laughter] That'd be bad.'" And the big thing the parents wanted, that had schoolchildren, was a set of encyclopedias. And about that time the Golden Book put out an encyclopedia, and coming in with the secondhand books would be individual copies; there would be Number 7 and Number 2 and Number 12 and so on. And I was always trying to get together sets, and then I would mend them. And when I'd get one set together, I would be so thrilled and had it all mended, and then I would give it to a family with children. And one mother said, "Oh, my children needed some material on the Magna Carta," and she said, "Look in the encyclopedia." And they did and it was there, and it had everything they needed, and she was so thrilled over that. And one little group of children wanted a set of encyclopedias, and just at that time a scientist from the Oak Ridge Laboratory came over with his wife and children, and they gave us a whole set of encyclopedias. They were getting a more advanced set for their children, so I sent this mountain family a card and said we had these encyclopedias for them that they'd been wanting. And they waited up at the mailbox for their parents to come home from their factory work so they could come and get their books. And, oh, it caused a great happiness. And more people would copy our bookshelves and run shelves all around their room and fill them up with paperbacks. And it was just fascinating, the interest in it. M.C: This period when you started this library is the same Seeman - 26 period during World War II when people were thinking that you were spies.  Was there any problem with the parents? Seeman: No.  By that time, I believe the War was just about over, and the parents were so grateful to us for starting the library and sending the books with the children. They could see that the books were harmless, that they were fairy tale books and books on Robinson Crusoe and King Arthur and all the old classics and funny books and drawing books. And another thing, when I had my drawing material the children would come.  I would let them use my paints and my paper, and it was fascinating to see what they would do with it. And sometimes the children would stay all night, and then the mothers would come and they would stay for a meal and we'd exchange garden slips and little packages of seeds. And some of the mountain people would often tie up a little package of seeds in a tiny little package twisted up together of cloth, and tie little corners together on it, and it was just fascinating. And then one nice familywe were especially fond of their childrenwhen they moved to another cove, for years we went there for Christmas and had the tree with them, and we all exchanged presents. And they remembered the time they lived in Tumbling Creek, But Tumbling Creek became famous. And when Scholastic Magazine had that article and every state in the union, practically, the schools sent books. And the children got writing, and then it was Ernest's job to write. He wrote such charming letters, and he would write back and he would tell about our dogs and our cats. And then the children commenced to write to our dog, and then they would tell about their pets.  [Laughter] And he wrote such charming letters that often a Seeman - 27 group of people who had already sent books would send books several times just to get more letters. M.C : [Laughter] Seeman: And there was a boys' club out in California, the Key Club, that really worked on it, and they made a project of it. Many people made projects of it, and they would go all over the school with posters saying, "Donate books to the Tumbling Creek Library, the Cabin Library," and collect the books and send boxes and boxes and boxes of books. But that was part of the secret of getting so many, was these charming letters of thank you, the appreciation, and told who would get them and so on. And often people sent boxes of clothes, too. And mountain people needed shoes, all kinds of shoes, and little jackets and coats and things. And I divided them around and gave some here and some there, according to the children I knew, the sizes they were, and gave them out. And we kept some, too. And a great many young people came to see us, and people came from the sociology department at the University, and friends sent other friends. M.C: ETSU, East Tennessee State University. Seeman: Yes. And sometimes people would come from New York, and their friends would always send friends, and then they would tell people to come, and carloads of people would come. And sometimes two or three cars would come on Sunday, and we'd have a cabin full of people. We'd all sit around and talk, and we sent them away with radical material and literature and books and talked international politics. And several times parents came to see what on earth attracted their young people to the house of an older couple. [Laughter] But a great many of our Seeman - 28 friends happened to be young, and we got used to bright, young, Interesting people. M.C: Can we stop for a second for you to tell a little bit about this beautiful place where we are at Tumbling Creek, and where we are, and what it looks like? Or what it looked like when you first came here? Seeman: Yes. Ernest got a mountain friend where we camped one time and were in the garden, and we got him interested in going to a radical school in Chicago. And anyway, before he did that, Ernest asked him if he would walk all over the country and help him pick out a beautiful place. And they walked for hundreds of miles all around . . . M.C.: And this was before World War II. Seeman: This was before World War II. And just stayed in mountain families in the mountain homes, and this Sam happened to remember that he once tried to sell some kind of materials through the mountains just as a travelling salesman with a pack on his back. And he remembered Tumbling Creek, what a beautiful, unspoiled place it was. And Ernest had several requirements he wanted. He wanted good, nice people and fine, bright people, and not too queer and too wild and too dangerous. And he wanted to get a place up next to that national forest, so when we located it couldn't spoil our place; it would have many miles of woods beside us. And he wanted a fine, rare spot. And so then he had two or three places in mind, but the name of Tumbling Creek just charmed him so. And the people who lent us the money for us to get started also liked that name, instead of a place like Clear Branch or some more ordinary name. And also Tumbling Greek was next to Seeman - 29 Cherokee National Forest and had beautiful hemlocks and a winding road and high mountains on each side. It was rather a shady cove, but it was not heavily populated on that account. A deep, tall cove and the fragrance of the forest, and Tumbling Creek was all little waterfalls, just coming down one after another. M.C: Now how far away from the main road . . . Seeman: It's about three miles from here, but to the nearest town it's about sixteen miles. And then about fifty-five miles to Asheville and forty, I thinksomething like thatto Johnston City. M.C: I was frankly very surprised when we just walked up to the old place at how really remote and steep it is. Seeman: Yes, it is, and the trail gets slimmer and slimmer, and at that time . . . M.C: You were really living in the forest. Seeman: Yes, right next to a government forest, but it was woods all around us. And at that time only a land sled ever was brought up the trail to carry loads. There were no cars came up at all.  You had to be on horseback or hiking with a pack on your back, a knapsack or a bag. The mountaineers don't use knapsacks; they always have bags and sacks, or "pokes" are what they call them. And a land sled was pulled by horses, an old wooden sledge, heavy, heavy thing with wooden runners. M.C: Is that how you got all your things in? Seeman: Yes, a truck brought them partwayand then they had to carry them the rest of the wayas far as it could come. M.C. t Also, I didn't understand, when you were talking about bringing the books, you talked about with the sticks. Seeman - 3 Seeman: Well, that was quite a bit later. By that time the road had been fixed, and people who had cars could come up the trail partway. About that time my eyes had given out and I moved down to the studio, and it was way down the mountain from the original place. M.C: What did you mean by bringing them in on sticks, the books? Seeman: Like having a broomstick cut off, and the books were tied with ropes. Then you put your stick through the rope, and one takes one handle and one the other, kind of like Chinese laborers. And very often, however, some of the books were very poorly wrapped, and the cartons would fall over and the books would all come tumbling out. And we had quite a time with the insecurely wrapped parcels. M.C: Could you talk a little more about if you had electricity or if you had a telephone or what you had in that cabin, and also a little bit about the Thoreau cabin? Seeman: Oh, yes. For many years we didn't have electricity, because to get electricity you have to have at least five households to get it, and we were the only one way up at the end of the cove, and lost up there. That's how my eyes got so badly damaged. I finally built a skylight to help my eyes, and it was too dark and too woods-dark in there. And then I had a lamp, but it didn't make a good enough light for an artist needs very good light. And then there were so many rains and storms that darkened the sky, and the hemlocks were dark. And finally I cut out a hemlock, which was a sacrilege, to make more light. M.C: Up at the roof of your house. Seeman: Yes. And then Ernest had a tiny little cabin above my Seeman - 31 cabin, just right above it. He wanted it to be made just the size of Thoreau's cabin at Walden, and it was ten by twelve and a tiny little cabin. He had a great big table in it and a wooden bed, and he spent practically every night up there. After supper he would go up this little ladder and around and climb up that steep trail to that cabin and work up there all night, practically, and then he'd sleep on his little wooden bed and come back in the morning for breakfast. And it was surrounded by rhododendron; he could look down this wild bluff all speckled with lichen, and then the creek and the waterfalls and the hemlocks around. It was a very romantic place, a beautiful place. Much rhododendron. M.C: Was that difficult, with him being a nighttime person and writing every night, and I think you described yourself in your book, An Intimate Journal, as being a twilight person. Seeman: It didn't jive, of course, but at least we didn't bother each other. M.C: [Laughter] Seeman: I couldn't write at night and  I couldn't read  very much, but later when we did get electricity, of course,  I played  records and music and  things.    But at that time I didn't have anything like that. It made a lonely life for me,  but it also was beneficial in a way. It made me very independent,  and  I got used  to being alone all the time and  just seeing him once in a while.    And  people said,  "Well,  he is sort of a cloaked  figure in your book" that I later wrote,  but that's because in real life he only came once in a while.    He showed up occasionally from his work,  and he just worked  endlessly.    And  he had Seeman - 32 the personality of genius for work. He was never tired of his work, and never any amount of effort or time was too much to put on it, which is certainly the mark of. . . . If anything will make you a genius and a fine writer, that will. M.C: I know you said you felt lonely, but did you feel like you had been put in second place or resent it? Seeman: You literally are, because I understand that a creative person has to do that and has to be ruthless enough to do it. And you have to have the depth of understanding to appreciate that and know that really, if a creative person didn't have that complete absorption in his work, that he couldn't do really good work. And you have to make up your mind that everything you have is going to be sacrificed for that book. And then you build your own life independently of that, though. M.C: But now you were also a terribly creative person. Did you feel supported in your creativity, or did you feel that the sacrifice was all towards his book Tobacco Town, his great novel? Seeman: I felt that his work was far more valuable than mine, but I couldn't work all night the way he did because my eyes wouldn't hold out anyway. But I used the best of my daylight and the best of my time for my work, and the rest of the time I worked on the farm work and took care of goats and chickens and ducks and herded the goats. And even till way after dark, almost, I'd be out herding goats up the mountain and taking them down, and I had to take my book out the very last. And there was always so much to be done, always carrying wood and water and trying to garden and can and keep things going. And sometimes Ernest helped me, but mostly he worked on his book. There were times when he'd Seeman - 33 work all night on the canning, too. If that had to be done mountain-style in a wash boiler, and try to have the big jars on the water-bath process, why, he would then take it over and sit up all in the late hours. M.C: And also I guess we should try to be clear about this. I think when I asked you once how you decided to come to Tumbling Creek, did you tell me that it was your idea? Seeman: It was my idea, because I always had it in my mind, on account of my Indian blood and my pioneer ancestors . . . M.C: [Laughter] Seeman: . . . that I must go to a wild and beautiful place, that I just couldn't stay in the city any longer. And first I was interested in getting acquainted with New York and Chicago and learning that kind of life, but I realized it wasn't for me and that it wasn't suitable for my health, that I just couldn't stand it, that for the rest of my life I was going to spend it where I wanted to. And actually Ernest was so much in love with his writing that if he could have continued his writing wherever he was, he would have lived in any kind of a place. But I demanded that we have a wild, beautiful place, and he agreed with that                           , but it was really my idea. And it's usually the man that will take the family and wrench it around and move it off to a ranch or to the Klondike or someplace . . . M.C.: [Laughter] Seeman: ... but in this case I did. The women are more and more commencing to realize what they want and trying to direct the life of the family in the direction they want.  If no one else has any ideas, why, you can do that. And I knew that he would be glad to live anywhere Seeman - 34 if he could write, so he could write here as well as anywhere. Not as well, but he could, and so that's the way we arranged it. M.C.: One thing that I find very brave that I guess we should also make clear, you've made reference to your eyesight. And I don't think that we've made it clear that you were making your living as an artist until your eyesight became bad.  You did make reference to the fact that your eyesight had gone. Was this in the fifties or the forties? Seeman: This was a little after World War II, I guess. It must have been over then. M.C: And you have glaucoma? Seeman: But then the Korean War came on. Yes, I got glaucoma from working in the dark, and it was such a strain because the lamps were poor. I never have been able to work by even good artificial light. I've always had to have good daylight. But there are many storms in the Smokiesit's kind of a rainy placeand everything turned dark. And even with the skylight it would turn pitch dark in the cabin sometimes, and I'd have to stop my work or strain my eyes so seriously. M.C: Oh, I know. That early period when you were here, were you making your living more from commercial work that you were sending back to Chicago or from the farming? Seeman: We didn't make any money at all, hardly,from the farming, because to make money from a farm you have to have a market. The mailman bought eggs from us, because we had eggs, and sometimes people would buy a rabbit or a chicken or something like that. And sometimes Seeman - 35 our friends,  if they came and would  camp around, they would buy some of the goat milk, but we were far too far away from any kind of a market to have a commercial farm.    I made it entirely from the drawings that I sent, the commercial designs.    And then when my eyes gave out, I had to send  back the work.    And then I couldn't get any workmen's compensation, because they said  I had given up my work myself and  it was my own fault, unemployment compensation.    And  I couldn't get any help as a blind person, because I could  still see but I just couldn't use them.    And my sight was still good,  but it was far too weak.    So I couldn't get any help that way.    And  Ernest didn't have his pension yet, and we then had so many animals, because the animals' nature Is so prolific.    The goats, we had three goats in the beginning,  and  finally we had seven goats.    And we had  about three or four rabbits,  and  then we got fifty-five rabbits.    And  then finally we had ninety chickens  .   .   . M.C : [laughter] Seeman,  .  .  . and we had several ducks.    And I started to raise bees, and I eventually built my one hive of bees up to several hives of bees. But it takes money to feed animals,  and  then we had  to fight off the hawks and the weasels.    And you think there aren't any wild animals around till you start to raise some kind of chickens.    And  the black snakes came and pushed the ducks off the nests and got their eggs, and  the hawks and  the weasels got the chickens, often one a day. The gpats all had buck kids,  which was a very odd thing,  but we'd  have as many as seven little bucks, and they would all have to be butchered. [Laughter] M.C.*  Because you wanted them for milk. Seeman - 36 Seeman:  Yes.    And  then when my eyes gave out and  I couldn't then afford  to feed  any of these animals,  then we couldn't sell the goats, and they had to be butchered.    And  we finally sold  some of the chickens, and  it was a disaster.    And  we starved  and the animals starved.    And I was too proud to borrow any money, and anyway nobody wanted  to lend.   .   .   . You can't get total support.     Sometimes people can give you a temporary support or a boost,  but they just can't keep you going all the time. So  I realized  that the mountain people got along by some member of the family would  go away and  work in a factory or a mine or the logging camps. And   it's usually the man does that,  but  I in this case did  so Ernest could  keep on with his work at home and  keep the place going.     But then he also needed  an operation, and  he had  to go over to the Veterans Hospital for that.    And   so we had  to  leave for a long time.     But after you once establish a home and  have a cabin,  no matter what you lose.   .   .   . We lost all the animals; that was the great tragedy.    But we had  the house to come back to,  and we just lived  to get back again,  and finally we did. M.C: One question before we go on to  the next period.     I think you've made reference in the tape to people coming and  visiting, and also a lot of radical people.    I also heard  you just said,  "You can't get total support from someone."    But where were the radicals when you needed  help?    You're talking about literally starving. Seeman:  Yes.    Oh,  yes.     You see,  radicals are usually fairly poor. They are temperamentally unsuited  to exploting anyone,  and  they are kindhearted  and  generous, and  people like that just don't make money [laughter] as a rule.    And they did  help some,  but we needed  complete Seeman - 37 help; that was the trouble. And nobody had that much money. And some of them did help. The man in Chicago that sent us literature helped Ernest for quite a while to keep his book going while I was gone. M.C.: Did you say something about how if people did offer you money, there was a string attached? Your sister and her husband, for instance. Seeman: Yes.  When I wanted to borrow the money to build a cabin from my sister and her husband, why, he wan ted me to swear that I would never again mention any radical subject or take any radical paper and that I would completely become conventional in my conversation and never say anything at all that would be construed as a dangerous subject. And I told him that I wasn't selling him my soul, that I only was asking to borrow money and would pay it back with interest, and I would never agree to shut my mind to this because I wanted to borrow a little money. And he had to laugh himself. [Laughter] M.C: Is this the violinist who is your brother-in-law, your sister's husband? Seeman: Yes. M.C.: Wasn't he, in fact, a radical influence on you in your early days? Seemani He and my sister were the ones that sent me the tickets to go hear Scott Neering, but he became frightened by the lynching of a radical minister they knew in Cincinnati, and he was so frightened that he just simply gave up all. . . . Although he still believed it in his heart, he just gave up all talk about it or any open carrying on of the radical idea at all. M.C: But that happened to him when he was still young, before Seeman - 38 World War I? Seeman: This was after World War I, when he was an older man. M.C: I mean his friend was lynched . . . Seeman: This preacher that he knew was lynched and only escaped with his life by getting up under a railroad bridge of some kind, and he was beaten into a pulp because he went and tried to get some factory people to make a union. And then the owners of the factory said that he was a communist, because any legitimate changes they needed in their way of working, well, this was just communism, so they could stop it that way. M.C:  Was he killed or not killed? Seeman: He wasn't killed. He escaped with them in the night and hung up and hid under a railroad trestle. And then in the morning he was just a mass of terrible black and blue, and his mouth was all out of shape, and  he was  .   .    M.C: And  your brother-in-law just heard  about it,  but it affected him. Seeman: He knew about it, yes. And then this poor beaten wretch went to a house and begged for help, and he was such a pulpy mess where he had been lynched and beaten that they turned him away; they wouldn't help him, which horrified my brother-in-law who is a sensitive musician. It horrified him so that he just was shut up on the subject altogether. M.C: Was that in the forties or fifties? Seeman: This was before World War II. And anyway, by that time he had just shut up completely, but I went right on talking. BEGIN SIDE I TAPE II Seeman - 39 M.C, period that we've been talking about that was a difficult one for you.    I think you mentioned that It was the early 1950's? Seeman:  Yes, during the Korean War,  I remember. M.C: And did  you say that you had  to leave,  when you couldn't feed the animals and had trouble feeding yourself.    And I think you mentioned  Ernest had to have an operation? Seeman, Being a veteran, he had the opportunity to go to the Veterans Hospital for his operation, and they kept him over there for nearly a year, trying to feed  him and get him in condition before they dared operate.    He was such a                      .    And  I realized that the mountain people kept their little farms going by some member of the family going away and working in a mine or logging camp, usually the men and the women would  stay and keep the farm going,  but I realized in this case I would have to be the one to do it.    I went to Cincinnati, and I couldn't get a factory job because I was too old.    They had a very rigid  age limit there;  they'd  even make you bring your birth certificate.    And also I knew that I couldn't do any repetitive action sitting in the factory, that I couldn't stand It, that I would be climbing the walls in no time.    And I got the idea of working as a governess in a wealthy home.    And I'd  been starving so long that that way I would  get wonderful food.    And  it worked  out all right. All you have to have is a very good personal reference, and they are so happy to get someone with some cultural background  in their home and not just have an ignoramus there to influence their children.    So Seeman - 40 I did get a job with a very wealthy family there, and they had a big stone chateau and three children. And I liked the work because it gave me a chance to make up the fact that I had had no children of my own. And I had magnificent surround ings and marvelous food, and it was very interesting to me to have a chance to get acquainted with the colored help in the kitchen, the cooks and the other maids and workers on the same economic level. It's a very different thing to talk to somebody just from a different frame of reference altogether, but when you are just making the same salary they are and doing menial work, you have a very close relationship. M.C.; For example. Do you remember anything in particular that happened with anyone in particular who was there? Seeman: They would tell me about their personal life.  When one cook wanted to get married and the employer didn't understand it at all, she said, oh, no, that she would have to stay there and entertain a wealthy old grandmother and cook a great big Christmas dinner and give up her marriage plans altogether. And she was furious about it; in fact, she left. But they confided to me all sorts of interesting things, and this one young cook said to me she had a man who was tall and very difficult to get along with and said, "My people are dangerous." And she said, "He's mean. He's black. And nothing I like ever suit him," she said. "Do you think matrimony would help us?" M.C.: [Laughter] Seeman: I hedged, and I said, "Well, they say there's an element of cruelty in love." And the German nurse came through about that time, and she said, "No, don't marry anybody like that. I have seen too many Seeman - 41 broken marriages." And the cook then was furious that she had told her not to marry this man, and she said, "She won't never get married. That old Miss Engel never going to get married. She don't know nothing." [Laughter] And it was very interesting to see how very accomplished these negro women were. And one woman was considerably older than I was, and she handled the job of cooking and all, cooked a regular Christmas dinner every night, and kept the great big lower part of the house cleaned and did all the silverware with great competency in her character. M.C.: I was just going to ask you if you felt demeaned by being household help? Seeman: In a way I did, that you would have to wear a uniform and go down the back steps. And there were gratuitous insults that were entirely unnecessary, but it was a way to get wonderful food that I needed, and I was taken everywhere in the limousine and given a lot of presents.  But still, it is too hard on your pride to do that sort df work; it's better to do almost anything than that if you can do it, if you have the eyesight to do it. But I didn't have very much choice. So as soon as I could I left there, much to their surprise and pain. They thought, in their magnificent mansion, that I would just be willing to stay there and eat my whole life out and let them take the marrow out of my bones. But I decided that as soon as I could, and I knew Ernest was finally about to get his little Navy pension, that we'd come back to the mountains. So I left there, and, no matter with salary and everything, nothing tempted me, the fine home or anything else; it wasn't for me. And I left there to go back to a rough little house in Seeman - 42 the mountains and was happy to do it. And after I got home, then I got out my children's book that I had started on my honeymoon in Mexico, and I took that out and finished it at that time and was able to sell it. And that's where I met the editor that helped build our library. I believe I talked about that, though. [interruption] M.C: I think we're going to go back to Cincinnati for just a minute. Seeman: The same cook that was so disappointed and angry that her wedding was put off by the employer just for a social event, she and I were up in the upstairs of the big mansion one time, looking in our mistress's dressing room. And the walls were covered with beautiful flowered cloth, all varnished in a kind of a golden varnish over it. And they had Swedish blue furniture and a Louis XIV Swedish blue chair as a toilet seat covering the toilet. And the cook said, "Oh, my, think of sitting on a thing like that." And I said, "Sarah, you go ahead and sit on it and use it, and I'll stand guard." And so she did, and it gave us both great satisfaction. [Laughter] And I wrote and told my husband all the odd little things that happened around the house. But it was very interesting to see the inside of a wealthy house from the backside of the house and the rough sides, and see the employers all green in the gills from being up so late at night, and the social life, and the children and the things that happened. And he told a radical friend of ours that I was working as a servant. She said, "Oh, my, a woman with her background, to work as a servant, it's like the Romans hiring the Greeks for slaves." [laughter] Seeman - 43 M.C* I think I forgot to ask you more about your schooling.  Could you tell me where you went to school as a girl? Seeman: Well, I really didn't have any big cultural background except just grade school and high school, and I took the art course in high school. M.C.: Was high school in . . . Seeman: Cincinnati. And I won a scholarship to go to the art school. And I went a half a day to art school, and the other day I took my lessons in the mornings at high school. After that I worked a while, and then we moved up into Kentucky before going to New York. As soon as I got to New York, and later in Chicago, I went to night school very often, or I went to a play or a concert or stood up at the opera. And there are so many things that can be done for a small amount of money. Of course, we didn't have much money during the Depression, but I would go practically every other night to the Eva LaGallienne Theater on Fourteenth Street, and I heard all the plays, some of them over and over. And my husband didn't want to go at all . . . M.C: Your first husband. Seeman: ... and I went to night schoolI believe I told about those radical schoolsbut in Chicago I went to Chicago University, a big auditorium in the Art Museum that they had for public lectures. And there they had a series of courses by the Chicago University staff, all their lecturers, and I went night after night to that. I kept those going. It came at a very good time. I could go to work and then just have supper and then go right to this class and then go home, and it didn't make it late. It wasn't hard, like going home and then coming Seeman - 44 back would have been very difficult.    But I took all sorts of subjects.    And I had  never even heard  the word  "ecology" at the time.    And  I went to lectures on archaeology,  and  I remember one of the designers say she wouldn't go to any old dry things like that,  and  I said,  "You should  see the people that go to hear the archaeology lectures."    [laughter]    They look like they came out of the State Department, or they look  .   .   . M.C: [Laughter] Seeman:  .   .   .  like foreign diplomats." The most beautiful,  exotic women.    They were not a lot of crummy old  professorish types, dull or dry-looking,  at all; they were romantic-looking people. M.C: I think that a lot of your education had  to do with training yourself as an artist.    And  then when you left  Cincinnati and  returned to Tumbling Creek,  your eyesight,  I understand,  was not good  enough. You didn't regain it;  you couldn't continue with your art work. Seeman:  But that was because,  after I came to Tumbling Creek, the light was so poor and  I didn't have any electric light for years. And the oil lamps were insufficient, and then there's so many storms in the Smoky Mountains that the cabin was often very dark.    And  it was woods-dark, too,  with so many trees around.    And  that's what really laid  the foundation for the ruin of my eyes,  because they never had been very strong.    And  I never had  been able to go to the type of night school where I would  have to do a lot of study;   I would  just go and  listen to the lectures.    And I couldn't go and  work on art classes at night, because I couldn't use my eyes in the daytime and at night, too.    And  so then,  after my eyes gave out,  I had to  change my work and  I got interested   in taking notes.    And  I decided   I would Seeman - 45 get a typewriter and learn to type. M.C: Is this the period when you also considered learning Braille? Seeman: Oh, yes, I thought about learning Braille because I couldn't read at night, and I thought if I knew Braille that I would be able to read all I wanted in the dark.  But instead of that I borrowed the money from my sister to buy a portable typewriter, and I learned to touch type. Then I could transpose my notes that I took all the time; I just automatically wrote them down. I'd put them in a little notebook in my hip pocket of my blue jeans, and they were all covered with mud and water and rain. And I just wrote things down right at the time or directly afterwards and made little sketches along with them sometimes. And I put these notes in an envelope tacked on the side of the wall beside my typewriter table until I had a whole fat envelope full of them. And one time when I was reading a book called Krip, Come Home, a story about an injured bird that migrated and didn't come back one time from the migrationit was a pet brown thrasherand I noticed she had all sorts of little nature notes that the woman had taken herself, just like mine. I thought, "Well, I could write like that, too." So I just got mine out and started putting them together and building the story of our experiences in Tumbling Greek with all my original notes. And that's what they call immediacy attained in writing when you can have it from firsthand notes taken right on the scene. People who go on camping trips and think they'll write their notes after they come home haven't got anything. If they'd write them right at the spot, they would find that they could write fresh and Seeman - 46 original material, and they can never recapture again. And so this way, they gave the book a very fresh and unusual quality, so that when I . . . M.C: This is your book, the Intimate Journal. Seeman: Yes. When I wanted to sell that book, I just took excerpts here all through the book to show the type of writing, and it would hold up, and sent it in here and there and several places. And finally Crown took an interest in it, and they had their readers, one after another, read it, and they said, well, they weren't sure it would sell, but that the book should be published. And of course it was original material and fresh material and . . . M.C: Was it hard for you to switch to writing from drawing? Seeman: It wasn't, because I was so fascinated with the life I was living and saw so many interesting, odd things, and all I had to do to put those down, and it just seemed natural. They just fell into place like the pieces of a mosaic. And this was a different thing from cooking up a story from the ground up and having the skill to think of just making it up completely. This was right from life, and I just took a-hold of it and translated it right into . . . M.C: Were you able to have blocks of time to do this, or were there so many visitors that. . . . Seeman: We had a good many visitors by that time. Everybody that came to Tumbling Creek seemed to be so charmed with the place that they would send other people, and sometimes  ?  M.C.: [laughter] Seeman: . . . there would be six or seven people come at once, and they'd come and they'd bring their children. But the problem was that I had to cook meals for them, and they . .  M.C: And these were mostly radicals? Seeman - 47 Seeman: They were mostly young radicals,  and  the problem was that they literally didn't have time to help.    But they didn't help,  and  they didn't have time to help because they only had time to have dinner and then take a walk in the woods,  and  then they had  to go on wherever they were going. M.C: Did  you resent that? Seeman: At first I didn't,  and  I tried,  and  I knew that they needed to walk in the woods, that they didn't get to see anything like that and it was a great treat for them.    And  I didn't want the wives to stay and help me,  because I wanted  women to get out and  get the walk in the woods, too,  so I just left me with all the work.    And  finally it got so that it was just commencing to wear me out,  and  I commenced to make a rule in my own mind  that those that didn't help were not going to be invited back or get to stay.    And  this broke my husband's heart,  because he loved  to have all the young students sitting around him talking,  like a Greek scholar talking to all his students and  his companions.    And he couldn't understand  it,  how I could  turn away the young radicals, that he loved  them and  he wanted  more and  more.     But I said,   "Those that don't help I just can't have come again,  because it isn't fair for one person to do all the hard  work and the dull work when it would be so easy if everyone helped." M.C., Did  he understand  what you were saying when you complained about that? Seeman; I don't think he understood,  because he went to a friend of ours and told him that I was balking about having so many guests, and Seeman - 48 this friend of ours said, "But she has to do all the work. All the responsibility and the hard work falls on her." And he understood that he happened to be one of the ones who had always helped with the dishes and the cooking, and bring food for the table, and just didn't eat up whatever I produced. And the others would say, "Well, just tell her to raise a big, big garden" or "We like homemade bread." M.C.: [Laughter] Seeman: "We didn't bring any bread with the groceries we brought to add to the meal, because we want her to bake the bread." M.C.: Oh, no. Oh, my gosh. Seeman: And oh, I would just tear my hair, because they wanted me to bake it on the fireplace and the hard way, and have to bake it with the baker.  I know it was a novelty and all that, but it just put me to endless work. And it just got so our other friends would say, "The toll they have taken on you!" When our friends that had a cabin near us saw the guests all trooping up to our cabin, they'd groan for me, although my husband couldn't understand it at all. His feelings were hurt that I was turning people away, M.C.* Now were the men and the women guests the same about this? Seeman: Well, the men just took it for granted, most of them, that a man doesn't have to help, but sometimes the women would offer to help. But I would always say, "No, you need to have a walk, too. It's your vacation; you need a vacation just as much as your husband does, and you just go ahead and take a walk in the woods." But it all came out of my life's blood, so I finally just had to change that. [interruption] Seeman - 49 One exceptionally attractive girl, a young radical, brought her own guests. M.C.; [Laughter] Seeman: And  she would  bring as many as three guests without any warning,  and  they'd  stay to dinner,  but she wouldn't help.    She never offered  to even pick up a cup and  saucer.    Then after dinner she would just move over to the couch and  get all the men around  her and   continue to talk politics.    And  I happened to be interested  in that myself,  but she left all the work for me to do.     I thought,   "Well,  a young girl ought to be trained  to have good  manners to help,  at least.    One woman ought to help another."     But she didn't help at all.     I got to thinking, "Well,  she isn't really a good  radical,  because radicals are so kind and  generous and  so understanding.    They're so helpful.     I never have met a radical yetshe's the first one I ever metwho's not helpful, and didn't even offer to help.     She's so  cold  about it,  and   just takes the attitude that she could talk and  I was  just a servant to work at the table." And  so I thought,   "Well,  she must be a labor spy,   because she couldn't  .   ,   . M.C: [Laughter] Seeman, ... be a genuine radical." I later found out that I was wrong, but I just came to that conclusion because I couldn't imagine any intelligent person and kind and considerate person acting that way. And furthermore, she wanted to send another friend she knew, a young boy. She wrote a letter and said, "I have a friend who needs a lot of good food and rest . . . M.C ; [Laughter] Seeman - 51 Christmas vacation,  they just wanted  to work on something to get acquainted  with the South and  the problems of the South.     So I told them that my husband at that time was in the hospital,  and it wasn't such a good time,  but they went out and  cut a lot of wood  for me. And  they cooked  the meal and gave me something,  because I had  just come in from the town.    I hadn't eaten anything myself and  was quite late.    And  I said,  "Well,  you know,  I have always wanted  to have a youth hostel,  and  now at last I have a hostel and  I have the youths." And  one of the students spoke up and  said,  "Well,  maybe you've just got a lot of hostile youths." M.C: [Laughter] Seeman: But I laughed so, because the mountain people have a great sense of humor, but that type of wit was very unusual [laughter], so I was amazingly tickled about that. M.C.: We talked all throughout about your calling on your pioneer ancestors. Is that a real source of strength to you? Is it something important to you? Seeman: I had one woman tell me she read completely through my book, waiting for me to give all the credit to the Great Creator. And I thought, "Well, my idea about prayer is the only legitimate prayer is to call on the strength of your own ancestors." You have a right to do it: it's in your blood; it's in your bones; and Americans have a great pride in their pioneer ancestors. And also my beloved Indian blood, too.  So in times of need, that's what I call upon, and how the people held the fort and lived in the wilderness.  Lived in stone Seeman - 52 houses and went out and worked at the edge of the forest in a great time of danger in the early pioneer days. So I think that this is a great strength to have behind you, and everyone feels that who has it, I believe. M.C.: Do you feel that you're a pioneer? Seeman: Well, pioneering at this time is so different from the way the pioneering was in the old days. If you had any kind of a wound in the old days, why, you probably would die of blood poisoning. And now we have penicillin and all sorts of medical aids to help, and we know about the germ theory. But in the old days, if you had to have an arm cut off, why, they would have to sear it with a hot iron, and if anyone got scalped, why, as Mark Twain would say, "he wasn't of much account after that." [Laughter] M.C : [laughter] Seeman: So, although they had a system, I understand, of driving nail holes in the skull and letting little bits of juice ooze out and form a scab all over the head and it's said to have saved certain people, but I question that myself. M.C: I don't know whether these things are so intertwined you can sort them out, but first, would you consider yourself a pioneer on the land and a pioneer in the spirit? And which came first, or was each needed for the other? Seeman: I don't consider myself a real pioneer, except in the modern life as most people are now getting very timid about going out and living in the woods. And they're so used to airconditioning and having everything just comfortable and having houses around them. Seeman - 53 People have come to see us and are absolutely appalled by the utter darkness surrounding us at night, no lighted windows anywhere and no police to call and no telephone. But I know too much about the pioneer age to consider that this is anything like pioneering. It's a soft life compared to what the pioneers had. You have so many aids and helps, and if you can get to a phone you can call the rescue squad to come, and within a matter of fifteen or twenty minutes can come flying up the road. Now they can; couldn't in the early days. M.C: But do you think that your spirit would have . . . Seeman: I think that my spirit has been greatly toughened by this experience. I guess some people are just naturally not afraid as much as others. Some are much more timid than others, and it's my theory that even radicals are born and not made, almost, in that you can't breathe fire into people if they don't have some fire in them in the beginning, if they're mousy and timid. They have to be good steel in the beginning. As Scott Neering said, "There are bricks, and there are fire bricks." M.C.: But one question I do have is you talked about your ancestors and harkening to that. And we've teased and kidded a little bit about the Indian ancestry in the sense that it's your wish. Seeman: Uh-huh. M.C: It's like your spirit ancestors. I mean it's not documented. Seeman: Oh, I see. Oh, yes. M.C* And do you feel that people can harken back to a spirit that they adopt themselves, or their literal ancestors? Seeman - 54 Seeman:  I have a woman, a friend, who's interested  in spiritualism, and  she thinks that we all have Indian guides,  but I think that's utter nonsense, that any Indian brave would  scorn the idea of taking a fat, middle-aged  woman around  as a guide. M.C.: [Laughter] Seeman: But she'll say, "Well, I'll say, 'Well, now, Red Feather, just go find me a place in the parking lot.'" M.C: [Laughter] Seeman: I just want to guffaw right in her face, [laughter] And she said well, this was the reason I'm so brave, that I have a wonderfully strong Indian guide. M.C : [Laughter] Seeman: And I said, "Well, I wish I had, but I unfortunately know I haven't." M.C: [Laughter] Seeman: I have to be my own guide.  But I think that some people just naturally have a more sturdy nature, and are naturally more adjusted to being alone and don't fear being alone, and somehow you have the strength within you to call on when you need it. For instance, if I'm in a time of great fear, I know that I can functionjeven though my hands are shaking and my knees are knocking together, I can still function. M.C: You actually told me something that I thought really called on your own gifts. And it was about a time when you were in a park. Seeman: Oh, in Cincinnati. I stayed with my sister one time. Seeman - 55 M.C: About how old  were you? Seeman: I must have been in the mid-forties somewhere,  but I had long hair and I was active,  and  from the back view probably looked much younger.    And  I had  this long hair and  a trenchcoat.    And  I took a walk in the little park across from my sister's that bound  around  the hill there in Cincinnati.    And  what I didn't know is that no woman dared walk in that park,  that they had  been molested  several times by hoodlums. And  I was halfway around  in the lonely part of the park,  and  right above on the hill I heard  a tromping like a lot of horses coming down the hill. And here came a whole gang of young toughs.    And one of them had  a rope in his hands,  and  they stood  across the path.    And  the one in the center, the ringleader,  had  this rope,  and  I turned  around  and  looked  at them and  I knew I couldn't go further around the mountain because I would  be shut off even more in a wild   place.     It was very early on a Sunday morning. M.C: Is it a mountainous park? Seeman:  Well,  Cincinnati is on hills,  steep hills and wooded  hills, and this park just wound  around  this wooded   place too steep for any houses to be.    And  so I realized  I wouldn't dare go further around  in the wooded part,  and  I couldn't get back to the street because these toughs were right in my way.    So I knew I couldn't run and  I couldn't scream,  and I've always been told  that you must never,  never show fear.    So I took out my handkerchief,  and  I honked my nose in a very unromantic way .   .   . M.C.: [Laughter] Seeman:   .   .   .  as if I'm a very old  lady and   I have a very bad   cold. Seeman - 56 And I walked slowly back.  I turned directly, immediately, and walked back toward them. And they stood across my path, just waiting for me with this rope in their hand, and when I got within almost touching distance of this man with the rope I kept my eye on him and just looked at him seriously. And I just gave him a cold, scientific look. And at the last minute he suddenly turned and ran, and they all ran with him. They ran down the mountain like another troop of goats. And I walked on, and I realized that I had just saved myself by a miracle of not showing any fear, not showing cowardice or running or squealing or . . . M.C, What do you mean by a scientific eye? Seeman: If you look at a person very analyticallyand it may be they think it's just the schoolteacher's eyebut just look at a person and study the person's face.  Just coldly, and just look it up, and as if you were drawing them. M.C, In other words, it's something you learned as an artist, the way you look at someone's face when you're drawing. Seeman: Yes, yes. And you just look at them utterly impersonally, and just study the color of the face and the shape of the face. And your look will be so intent and intense that I've seen a person quail before that many times. And I have extremely sharp eyes, even when I want them to look that way, and he just broke under it and ran. I just simply dominated him with my scientific eye.  But I was in the park one time, and the same thing happened over here. I realized I was being followed, and I turned aroundit was time to use my scientific eye Seeman - 57 and it was a lunatic. And he grinned a silly grin, and he said, "Do you want to hear me sing?" And I said, "Yes, oh, yes." I thought, "If that's all you want. ..." So he started to sing "Jesus, Lover of my Soul," and all the while I kept walking, walking a little bit. I wouldn't let myself run. But I had been frightened; it was a lonely part of the park. And then he said, "Do you want to hear another song?" I said, "Oh, yes, yes, please sing another one," but I kept on walking until I outwalked him.  But there wasn't much use to using my scientific eye on him, I don't think. [laughter] M.C, [laughter] I guess it pays to know the time and the place. [interruption] Seeman, I had a friend in New York who liked to ask me every so often, "Well, do you think you'll ever be a success?" And I said, "I'll have to find out first what success means to me." I know that my chances of being a success according to the kind of person who will have a penthouse and brilliant society engagements and so on will never happen, but that I can attain a success and a reasonable type of success in something that would really be meaningful to myself. And now I know that, although I haven't been a financial success, I have had a great many of the things I've wanted. I have gotten to try a lot of things I've always wanted to try, and that's all you can ask of life is a good, long chance to try what you want to try, regardless of success or failure. I think that one of the most important things in success from my standpoint is to be self-directive, not to be bossed around, be independent.  I'm violently independent, I guess. Here come my ancestors again. [laughter] Seeman - 58 M.C: [Laughter] Seeman: And I think to live where you want to live.  I have been successful in living in a wild, beautiful, rare place for many, many years. And most people would be glad just to spend a week here or a few days for a vacation, and never dream of having fall and spring and winter, just having a little bit of time in the summer and not seeing any of the other seasons at all. And I've had a chance to wander and to think and to read and to follow many subjects I wanted to. And I have had friends. And I feel that one of the great things of living in the mountains and in any country locality is to be part of a neighborhood where people mean something to each other. And this is a rare thing in the city
