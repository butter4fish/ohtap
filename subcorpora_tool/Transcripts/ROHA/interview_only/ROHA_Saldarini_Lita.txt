Shaun Illingworth: This begins an interview with Mrs. Lita Saldarini on March 27, 2000 with
Shaun Illingworth and …
Sean Harvey: Sean Harvey.
SI: Mrs. Saldarini, we’d like to thank you for joining us and allowing us to interview you.
Lita Saldarini: My pleasure to be here.
SI: We’d like to begin by asking you a little bit about your parents, starting with your father.
Could you tell us about his background?
LS: Well, both my parents were born in Italy. My father came from a small farming community
near Asti in Italy, which is in the north, wine producing, and that’s what their farm was. They
had vineyards. At a very early age, he immigrated to Argentina with his grandfather. I know
very little of that history, except for the fact that he did do that at an early age. He had a brother
and a sister who were living in Buenos Aires and were in business, so that was their reason for
going there, because he came from a large family. There were six or seven [children], and the
vineyards didn’t really produce enough income to support a large family, so several of them left
home at an early age to earn a living. He subsequently decided that he wanted to come to the
United States and arrived in New York sometime before World War I, I believe. My mother, on
the other hand, came from Turin. She came over in 1920. This was after the war. Conditions in
Turin and in Italy, generally, during World War I were pretty terrible. She was not happy at
home, so at age nineteen, she decided that she wanted to come to the United States, because she
was a very progressive person. Although she did not have too much education beyond grammar
school, the family was always well read, and they had a lot of ambition and energy. She was
basically extremely intelligent. So at nineteen, she set sail for New York and never wanted to go
back to Italy. She lived in New York or the New York area all of her life. She loved New York.
It certainly presented a lot of opportunities for self-education. … Her sister was a very good
seamstress. My mother was also in that line, and she did go to work in the garment center in
New York City upon her arrival. She went to night school immediately and learned English, and
she always said that the Daily News was her great teacher because of the pictures and she could
read the captions … and she became very fluent in English. My father, on the other hand, was a
baker in Italian bakeries and worked with other Italians, so he never mastered English to any
great degree. … They married in New York in 1924. I was born in 1926, and before my brother
was born in 1928, they moved to Union City, New Jersey, which was where many people that
they knew lived. … That’s where I grew up, went through grammar school until … just before
the war, 1940, World War II, now, and I graduated in 1940. … At that time, since it was
wartime, it was the end of the Depression, which for my family was a very difficult period,
although we never wanted for very much. There wasn’t too much thought that both my brother
and I could go to college, so it was decided that it was more important for him to do it, and I was
perfectly agreeable to that. … I decided, in fact, in high school, I had taken a commercial
course, because I had no thought of going to college, and, I guess, at that time, the careers that
my friends and I thought were most open to us was either being a schoolteacher or a secretary.
… So I chose the business world.

SI: Going back a little bit, your father’s original bakery, was that in New York?
LS: Yes, he worked in the bakeries in New York, downtown.
SI: Did he ever talk about that neighborhood? Was it an Italian neighborhood?
LS: Yes, it was. Bleeker Street, MacDougal Street were [in Italian neighborhoods]. In fact,
that’s where he lived when he arrived in New York and had friends there, and since he had been
a baker also in Buenos Aries, he continued that when he came to New York.
SI: As a child, would you ever go back with your family to New York to visit?
LS: Oh, yes, my mother was, we were always New Yorkers basically, and she would take us.
Union City was very convenient to New York. We were right across the river, as Joe mentioned,
so she would go in very often, take both my brother and I either to Radio City for a children’s
movie, to Macy’s or Klein’s on Union Square for clothing and Nedick’s for orange soda and a
hot dog.
SH: What was it like as a small child growing up in Greenwich Village?
LS: Well, I didn’t grow up in Greenwich Village. I was born on the Upper East Side and we
moved to Union City when I was one year old. … When my parents married, they had an
apartment on the Upper East Side on 101st Street and about 2nd Avenue, so I never grew up in
New York until we moved back to New York when I was already in high school.
SI: What was it like growing up in Union City? What was your neighborhood like?
LS: Oh, it was a very clean, middle class area. Actually, I grew up not too far from where Joe
grew up, although we didn’t know each other in those days. But it was basically Swiss, German,
Italian neighborhood, sort of blue-collar, but very pleasant. … We had our own little home.
SI: I’m going to ask you the same question I asked your husband. Did you maintain any
traditions in your family from Italy, like food or customs?
LS: Well, yes, certainly cooking. Customs, not so much. I don’t know that people from
northern Italy were very different from Americans. They were not particularly religious. We
also were Roman Catholic, but people in northern Italy were more of a socialist-bent then a
church-bent society, so there were not too many traditional [customs] except for the normal
Christmas and Easter, that kind of thing.
SI: Saint Joseph’s Day on March 19th.
LS: Yes. Well, that’s to the Italians like Saint Patrick is to the Irish, so there was always a
special zeppole my mother made as a dessert, but that’s about all.
SI: Did your family, on either side, maintain any ties in Italy?

3

LS: Yes, yes, both my mother and my father were the only ones in their respective families who
immigrated to this country … so I never knew any of my aunts or uncles or grandparents, never
met them.
SI: Would they send letters back and forth?
LS: Yes, they would, but the mails were rather erratic. Sometimes they would write, sometimes
they wouldn’t, sometimes you would get the mail, and sometimes you wouldn’t.
Correspondence was pretty erratic and slow as it came by ship.
SI: Were they interested in following the news in Italy and what was current there in the ‘20s
and ‘30s?
LS: Not particularly, no. No, my father had gone back at one time, I know, before he was
married, before he married my mother. That was after he left South America. … That must
have been an interesting experience, because at that time, it was about 1924, the Fascists were
already in power. When he went back to his small village and he saw what was going on, the
few Fascists were very arrogant young men, and he just didn’t like the whole atmosphere. It was
very, it was not nice, so he decided he didn’t want any part of that, didn’t want to get involved
with being a Fascist or, you know, being conscripted into some kind of army, so he came back to
the [United States].
SH: So your parents really felt there was nothing to hold on to.
LS: That’s right. No, my mother was happy when she left Italy. She swore she would never go
back, didn’t go back until 1959 with me. No, she always loved the freedom of this country and
very different life. … She loved New York, because you could be yourself, be anonymous, and
there was no, you know, no small town gossip and people minding your business. Everybody
minded their own business. She was a very independent person, so she liked life here.
SI: Did she work after your parents got married?
LS: No, she did not. She was an excellent homemaker and cook; made her own and my clothes.
SI: Given how you said she was independent, did she have any political leanings or any causes
that she was interested in?
LS: No, no, she did not get involved in community affairs. However, she was a great admirer of
Roosevelt. She felt that he did a lot for poor people. Eleanor Roosevelt was also a person she
admired. From ’24 to ’29, the economy was booming, as it is today. … Then when the crash on
Wall Street occurred we were already in Union City, and she, I always remember, she said my
father came home and said, “Oh, there was a crash on Wall Street,” or, “Wall Street crashed,” or
something, and it didn’t really register with her what it meant. She said, “Well, we own our
house and we have a little bank account,” and it didn’t affect them at all, but, of course, it really
did, because the economy then took a downturn and the Depression years were difficult.

SI: Do you remember as a child the effects in terms of the Depression? A lot of people
mentioned that hobos would come through town and knock on people’s doors asking for food.
LS: There were a lot of door-to-door salesmen, I remember that, which is something that for a
man was certainly someone who didn’t have a job and they were, they would sell magazine
subscriptions, Fuller brushes, vacuum cleaners, so that kind of thing was very prevalent. People
were, it was difficult to earn a living. In a small town like Union City, it wasn’t so noticeable as
it would have been if we had been in Manhattan, where, I understand, people were sleeping on
the Riverside Drive in the park, and so forth. There were shanties. But we were not, you know,
we were not exposed to that, and we were even not so much, as children, in touch with the news,
because you got the news on the radio. We went to a movie once in a blue moon and there, you
know, you had the newsreels, but you didn’t have television, so your only source of information
was the radio and the newspapers, which in our family continued to be the Daily News.
SH: You mentioned that your mother really liked Roosevelt a lot.
LS: Yes.
SH: Did your family openly talk about politics in the house, or was it more of something you
found out later?
LS: Probably found out more later, because in my household my father worked at night because
the bakeries worked at night, so he would be, he would go off at night, we saw him for breakfast,
then he would be sleeping for most of the day. So really dinner time was about the only time
that we got together, so there was not an awful lot of political discussion between my parents, or
I was not aware of it.
SI: Did you notice that the New Deal programs had any effect on either your life or your
neighborhood in terms of programs such as the WPA?
LS: Oh, yes, I was aware of WPA. People in town, there were a lot of ditch-diggers and so
forth, and late in the ‘30s, my father was disabled and I know that my mother tried to then go out
and find some work and that was impossible, the doors were closed and it was very difficult.
Many people were on relief, as welfare was called in those days. My mother was always proud
of the fact that she never went on relief. When we moved to New York in 1940, my parents
managed a building on 22nd Street owned by the Baker’s Union, of which my father was a
member.
SI: What would you do for entertainment and fun in grammar school and high school?
LS: Well, I did have a brother, and we were very close in age; we were only fifteen months
apart, so we had mutual friends. I guess what the kids did was roller-skate down to the local
park. We played stickball in a small alleyway behind our home. We’d go to a movie
occasionally, but very occasionally, because I think they were ten cents, and ten cents was not
money that my mother threw around too easily. In fact, I don’t think she went to a movie that

5

whole time. We had friends and we would sit in our backyard. My father had built sort of a
gazebo, and, you know, our little friends would gather there. We would talk, play games. My
mother insisted that I learn how to embroider, which I did very, very reluctantly, and then I was
able to play, but I had to sew or something or other. She thought that was something that every
girl should do, but, to this day I do not sew very well. I was in high school during the war years
in New York. I might go to the Paramount with a friend. We were the so-called “bobbysoxers.” We grew up in the big band era.
SI: Did your mother, particularly your mother, ever take you to the World’s Fair in New York?
LS: Well, at that time, my father was already ill; he had been hospitalized. So she did have a
cousin who lived in Flushing, not too far from the Fair, and she sent us over there. We stayed
there with them, and my cousin, who was maybe sixteen at the time, would take my brother and I
to the Fair. My mother or my father never got there. My brother was only eleven, I was twelve.
SI: Did you have any particular reaction to it? Was it exciting?
LS: Oh, we thought it was wonderful, yes. I remember the main buildings, the Trylon and
Perisphere, (the globe), which I guess still exists, I’m not sure. I remember we would go on few
of the rides and some of the buildings. It was quite spectacular. Oh, I remember the General
Motors exhibit. Many, many years later I went to work for General Motors, so I always
remembered that [as] my introduction many years before. I never thought I’d wind up working
for that company. I remember the GE exhibits; some of those exhibits were quite futuristic. In
fact, I don’t think that the GM exhibits of the elevated, self-propelled cars really ever, … they
keep talking about it, but it is still a new technology. We also enjoyed the foreign nations
pavilions.
SI: Would you say that was the farthest you ever really traveled before high school?
LS: Yes, we did not travel very far. New York was about the border. … The family would go
into New York and take the subway down to Coney Island. That was about the farthest that we
would go. That was an all day project.
SH: Did your family have a car?
LS: No, we never had a car until my brother was old enough to drive.
SH: What was public transportation like back then?
LS: Well, it was good. There were trolley cars, both in Union City and New York, which were
wonderful. I don’t think there were many busses. The trolleys were the local transportation
down to the ferry and across. For two cents, you had a beautiful ferry ride right across the river,
so we didn’t feel any particular need for a car, nor could we afford one. In the ‘30s, there was
only one car owner on our block.

6

SI: In the late 1930s and even early 1940s, do you remember hearing any news about what was
going on in Europe or even in Asia?
LS: Oh, yes, sure. When, in fact, when I graduated from grammar school, which was 1940, the
war was raging in Europe, and that was one reason why we, myself and my friends, probably
decided we would go to work. We were not even thinking about college until the war was over.
In fact, I had taken a commercial course, which, thinking back, I regret, even to this day, because
then when I had the opportunity during the war period when money was more plentiful and my
parents said, “You know you should really go to college, you can go if you want to.” “Oh,” I
thought, “I have to make up these credits. I hadn’t taken the proper courses,” and I liked what I
was doing, so I put it off and I never graduated from college. I did take some courses at City
College and Hunter College, also, Katherine Gibbs Business School, but they were mostly
business courses.
SI: What did your commercial course consist of?
LS: Well, bookkeeping, stenography and the usual, then history and English, some math, and all
the rest. I guess the emphasis was on the typewriters and stenography, that kind of thing,
business law.
SI: Was it a mix of men and women in this course? Would you say it was more men or more
women?
LS: Well, no. This was a regular high school class. Most of the girls, I guess, did take the steno
and typing. I don’t know what the men took. They probably had more mechanical drawing and
things like that.
SI: Do you remember when you heard about Pearl Harbor?
LS: Oh, yes, we were living in New York then, at the time, and I do recall that it was a Sunday
and the announcement. I guess we had the radio on, and we did hear President Roosevelt saying,
“This day will live in infamy,” and so forth. Yes, I do remember that day very clearly.
SI: Did you and your family have any idea what the implication was, especially since you had a
young boy in the family?
LS: Well, my brother was younger than I, so there wasn’t too much fear that he would be
drafted or have to go into the Army, so that was fortunate. … Well, I suppose my parents
certainly felt the implication, that we lost all contact with our relatives in Europe at that time. As
a matter of fact, my grandfather died at some point during the war, but my mother was never
aware of it until mails resumed after the war. … Then some of the hardships started sinking in.
We had rationing and coupons and that kind of thing. There was some deprivation there, but
then there was more money around and life was not as difficult in New York during the war as it
had been during the Depression.

7

SH: How did your family’s view of the war change because of their background, considering
that their relatives were now the enemy?
LS: Well, they were never patriotic insofar as being Italian was concerned. So they would, no,
in fact, I’d have to say they were critical of the Fascist regime and Mussolini in particular, so
there was … no feeling on that side.
SI: As the war started moving forward and you were still in high school, did you have to work in
between classes or after school?
LS: No, I never did. Again, there were not that many opportunities, well, some of my friends
maybe worked in the Woolworth’s Five and Dime, but my mother never wanted me to do that.
So, no, I never worked while I was in school. Anyone under sixteen had to apply for working
papers in order to be hired for anything.
SI: Were you involved in any kind of scrap drives? Do you remember these sorts of things,
scrap drives or bond drives?
LS: Yes, I remember them, but, I was not involved. I think I really became more aware of
everything when I graduated high school and then went immediately to work at Columbia for the
Manhattan Project.
SI: I guess we’d like to move into that now. How did you become aware first that there was this
kind of opportunity?
LS: The recruiters from the Manhattan Project or the government came to the high schools to
the senior classes and were interviewing students who … would be interested in working at
Columbia, the Manhattan Project. So a friend of mine and I decided we would like that, and we
went up to Columbia to the physics laboratory. … I was not quite eighteen, and we were
interviewed by a couple of the physics professors and I remember I thought, “Oh, this looks like
it’s going to be really dull.” Yes, they were really tweedy, sort of typical professors you see in
the movies, and I thought, “I don’t think I’d like this at all.” … It was all these chemical things
and I had done stenography more in the business area, so I thought, “No, I don’t think I like
this.” So I wound up working in the receiving department, which was receiving all of the
materials for the physics laboratory, which, of course, at the time, I didn’t know really what was
going on, and they were building this reactor, or they were doing a lot of the experiments in the
basement. … Of course, I didn’t know all of that was happening down there. In hindsight, I
wish I had stayed with the professors. It would have been more interesting. I just knew I was
helping in the war effort. “Rosie the Riveter” was a popular poster; women were entering the
work force, filling in while men were in the service.
SI: What did the recruiters initially tell you? Did they tell you that you would be doing
stenography?
LS: I think they probably said they were looking for secretarial-typists, probably more typing
than stenography, but a little bit of both. … They had various openings in departments,

8

including the receiving department, and that’s why I had opted for that, because there were other
young people working there, so I felt like I was with other people my age.
SI: Did anybody from your high school go with you?
LS: The girl who came with me for the interview, I don’t believe stayed. She went elsewhere.
SH: What was the initial attraction for you to stay? You said that it didn’t seem like in the
beginning that you’d be interested, but you did stay.
LS: Well, I liked the atmosphere at Columbia. It’s a beautiful university, it was just pleasant, it
was an easy subway commute from where I lived, and I enjoyed the people that I was with. I
didn’t have too many specific plans at that time. I was just working to make some money and
have some fun.
SI: What did your parents think of this?
LS: Well, as I said at one point, when my mother felt that there was enough money that I should
go to school, to college, I indicated I was not interested. I liked what I was doing. I satisfied her
by enrolling in some night classes at Hunter.
SI: When you were initially pulled in, did they just say that you were going to be working for
Columbia, or did they say you were working for the Manhattan Project?
LS: We knew it was the Manhattan Project. We knew it was a government project in the
university. Yes, I was aware of that and I know we had identification badges and so forth. There
was security going in and out of the building. It was very nice. We’d go across the street and
have lunch at Teacher’s College, which is a beautiful facility, and it was just a very pleasant
time. At that time, they had the naval, I forget what they called them, the “ninety-day wonders”
probably; officer’s training. So one day I remember I saw a young man I had been in high
school with and he was in his Navy uniform and he really looked spectacular. So they were
around the campus; it was interesting to see them. We didn’t have anything to do with them, but
it was just nice.
SH: Did you ever have any idea during that time what the project was, or were you just in
receiving?
LS: No, no. You know, when I think of the materials that came in, Geiger counters and things
like that, Keffel and Esser were the big suppliers, Allied Chemical, all kinds of things, I had no
idea what that was all about. As I said, I think they recruited us right from high school because
we were too naïve to even think about finding out what was going on.
SH: Guaranteed automatic secrecy.
LS: Yes, absolutely. [laughter] They didn’t have to seal my lips. Actually, the Manhattan
Project was one of the top secrets of the war. I would learn later that the work was broken down

9

so that the people working on it only knew their phase of it and were unaware of the objective.
There were vaults deep under the Pupin Physics Laboratory where a cyclotron was built and
experiments in smashing the atom were conducted. The entire building was out of bounds to
anyone not connected with the project. Obviously, we could not have known anything of that
and we would have been terrified to know we could all be blown to smithereens. In our section,
we mostly typed up orders for the materials; I don't recall who collected them, but I remember a
man who had a desk and his own secretary who sat a little apart from the rest of us. He never
said very much, but he was on the phone a lot and also out of the office. I believe he was the
government liaison who had direct dealings with the physicists. We were told not to talk to
anyone about anything we saw or heard, and I certainly would have taken that seriously. It was
wartime and we knew anything concerned with an Army project was "classified" - those words
were undoubtedly clearly marked on everything we did.
SH: Was it after you graduated that they recruited you, or was it before?
LS: Yes, well, just before. When I graduated in February of ’44, I probably went right to work
the following month, maybe March or April of ’44, and was there until the news came out about
the dropping of the atom bomb, Hiroshima on August 6, Nagasaki a few days later.
SH: Did you make the connection at that point or …
LS: Oh, yes, then, you know, we were made aware of what had been going on. At that point,
actually, what happened somewhere along the line is that Union Carbide and Carbon took over
the project, and we were moved off the campus, the Pupin Laboratory, up to 132nd Street, which
at that time was one subway stop up the line, and into what had been, in fact, we called it the
Nash Building because it had been a car warehouse, maybe a parts place, so that was always
known as the Nash Building to us. … When the war ended, Carbide actually was running the
project.
SI: When you were still at Columbia, did you have any interaction with the scientists beyond
that initial meeting?
LS: No, unfortunately, I did not.
SI: Were you aware that things were going on down in the basement?
LS: Or, you know, in the whole building, sure. There was a lot going on.
SI: Was the campus just filled with military personnel?
LS: No, aside from the naval officers training program … there were no obviously visable
military around. I’m sure that some came in for meetings with the scientists. There might have
been an occasional uniform around, but not that it was overwhelming or that I was aware of. I
think Columbia probably was the same atmosphere as Rutgers during the war. It must have been
a much smaller student body; it was quiet.

10

SH: How did you view the use of the bomb at that time?
LS: When I found out about it?
SH: How did you feel when you found out about it back then?
LS: Well, I suppose from a very unsophisticated point of view I thought it was, I probably
thought it was a good thing, because, you know, the propaganda was [that] it ended the war soon,
that much sooner, and so I think I accepted the fact that this had happened. I guess I was a little
bit proud of having, you know, been around all of this happening. It was kind of exciting to find
out about it. I was also thinking of my brother, who was already approaching draft age.
SI: … What was it like to be in New York, just in general, during the war? What was the
atmosphere of the city?
LS: Well, I’ve always loved being in New York, even in wartime. I think New York had so
much to offer, and we did take advantage of all the cultural activities or the museums and so
forth, so I always loved New York. Of course, we did not go out very much at night; with the
brownouts, New York was pretty dark!
SI: Were those things cut back because of the war?
LS: No, not particularly. I think one problem was, you know, when you went shopping, food
shopping, you had to limit your purchases according to how many stamps you had left in the
ration book, but that was my mother’s problem. … I just took it as a matter of day-to-day life.
Of course, a black market existed and some things could be bought for a price.
SI: One story that I always heard about New York is the time a B-17 flew into the Empire State
Building. Do you remember hearing anything about that?
LS: Oh, yes, I remember that.
SI: I think it was either ’44 or ’45.
LS: Was it during the war?
SI: Yes, or maybe it was just after.
LS: I remember the incident. You know, I do remember that. It was 1945.
SI: Did you just hear about it or did you see the wreckage?
LS: I heard about it on the radio. It was a Saturday morning. I’m not sure that I saw the
wreckage. I was working at Columbia. My brother took the subway down, but it was cloudy
and the top of the building was not visible. I just remember the story of the girl who was on the
elevator that came all the way down. She had been quite severely injured. That was the story

11

that stood out in my mind. I guess at some point there was that movie with King Kong on top of
the Empire State Building, too. That was earlier.
SI: Do you remember, particularly earlier in the war, the blackouts in New York?
LS: Yes, oh, yes, all the homes had to have black shades. If you had a white shade, you had to
have a dark green outside, and you had to draw the shades at night, yes.
SI: Were you in New York at this time, or were you still in Union City?
LS: We moved to New York in 1940, so it was just before the war. We were living in New
York when war was declared.
SI: How did that work with air raid wardens and things like that? Do you remember?
LS: I don’t specifically remember air raid warnings. We lived in brownstones. [When] we first
moved to New York, we were on West 22nd Street, and then after that, we moved to 82nd Street,
off Riverside Drive, and subsequently to 74th Street, but of course, by that time the war was over.
The war, I guess, was over by the time we left 22nd Street. But I don’t think there were air raid
warnings around, but nothing ever happened, you know. I don’t even remember sirens going off,
but there were drills now and again. A family friend was a nieghborhood air raid warden, I
recall. He would participate in the drills.
SI: Did you correspond with anyone from your high school or from your neighborhood who
went into the service, or did you know anyone in the service?
LS: Once I left high school, I had no ties whatsoever with my classmates, as I didn't live in the
same neighborhood with any of them; I took a city bus to school and usually came home after
classes. However, the son of old family friends who lived on MacDougal Street in the city was
drafted into the Army. He became a parachutist. I remember the last time we saw him; when he
was home on leave, he told us he was going on maneuvers somewhere overseas and that he had a
feeling he would not come back. He said every time he jumped he thought it might be the last
time. Sure enough, a short time later, we learned he had been killed in a jump over Brazil. We
were extremely touched by this news and his mother never got over his loss.
SI: Did your brother ever have to go into the service?
LS: Yes. When he graduated high school in January 1946, the draft was still in effect and he
had to report to the draft board. He went to Fort Dix, New Jersey, where the boys were given the
option of enlisting for either a year-and-a-half, two or three years. As a draftee, time in the
service was open-ended. He opted for a year-and-a-half and was inducted into the Army. He
received his basic training at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and then, went to a
school for mechanics in Atlanta for three months. In October of that same year, he was sent to
Seoul, Korea, as a member of a motor pool which took care of vehicles for the American
peacekeeping forces. He was discharged in October '47, and then, enrolled at the College of
Engineering at NYU. To go back to a little of the history, the Japanese had controlled Korea for

12

fifty years. At the end of World War II, Korea was to become an independent nation, but there
was no government in place. The country was divided between the United States and Russia
until such time as a unified government could be formed. The U.S.-controlled sector went to the
38th Parallel; Russia had the rest. When Synginan Rhee was elected president of South Korea,
the United States pulled out, but the Russians had no such intention. When troops from North
Korea crossed the 38th Parallel, it led eventually to the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to
1953. I recall that a cousin of ours who had served in World War II was in the Reserves and he
went to Korea during that war. Fortunately, he came home.

SH: In light of your involvement in the Manhattan Project, how did you view the Rosenbergs
when that whole case surfaced and instances like that?
LS: Yes, that was interesting. At that time, I had a friend, who I was working with at General
Motors, and she had left and went to work for the FBI. … She was really interested in this case,
and I remember the night they were executed. We had tickets for a Broadway play, and she was
late because she would not leave the house until she had heard that they had been executed. We
were in the theater on that night.
SH: So your friend was very in favor of the execution.
LS: Oh, yes. Yes, she was. … I think I probably had some doubts about whether they were
really guilty, but I didn’t feel strongly about it one way or the other. But she’d felt very strongly
about it.
SI: So after the project was turned over from Columbia to Carbide, where did you go from
Carbide?
LS: Well, I stayed with the project until after war was ended in August of 1945. Then the
project was shut down in New York and we were all offered the opportunity to go to Oak Ridge,
Tennessee if we wanted to stay with Union Carbide. I did not want to do that, so I left.
SI: What did you do then?
LS: I went downtown. I worked for an insurance company for about a year or so, a little bit
over a year. … Then a friend of mine that I was working with had found employment with
General Motors, and at that time they were on Columbus Circle, so she said, “Oh, the pay is
much better there.” So I did leave and went to GM.
SI: How long were you with GM?
LS: From 1947 until I retired in 1983.
SI: During World War II, were you ever involved with the USO or the Red Cross or anything
like that?

13

LS: No, no, I was not. Some of us, some of the girls that I worked with at Columbia, we would
go down to 42nd Street, where the arcades were and so forth. There were servicemen around and
you’d sort of meet up and talk and maybe … go for coffee with them, but I never did go to any
USO functions or dances, no.
SH: Do you recall any of the instances with submarines coming into New York Harbor?
LS: No, I’m sure I was aware of it, but … I have no memories of anything like that.
SI: What was your work schedule like at Columbia? Was it sped up because of the war? Did
you have to work extra shifts?
LS: No, no.
SI: Was it just a standard, eight-hour workday?
LS: Yes, and a half day on Saturdays. In fact, it was mostly typing at that time, typing up orders
and things like that. As I look back on it, not very interesting.
SH: What type of work did you do with General Motors when you finally went on?
LS: Well, I went to work immediately with the legal staff
SI: What kind of duties did you have in that?
LS: I started as a secretary-steno, working in various areas, such as workmen’s compensation,
insurance, litigation and, by the time I retired, some thirty years later, had advanced to Executive
Secretary to the Vice President and General Counsel. One fond, early memory I have was seeing
Alfred P. Sloan, who was quite old by then, but still an active member of the Board. I also recall
coming through a doorway and literally bumping into John Thomas Smith, the first General
Counsel, who, in the late ‘20s, had incorporated Buick, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, Pontiac and
Cadillac into one company, General Motors. His office paneling had been brought over from a
mansion in Europe, something wealthy millionaires did in those days. It was one of the most
beautiful offices I have ever seen. Then, in the late ‘60s, Ralph Nader wrote his diatribe against
the Chevrolet Corvair, Unsafe at Any Speed and it was the beginning of government involvement
with car safety. There were hearings in the Senate and GM executives were called to testify.
This exposure was something new for them and they looked for a prominent attorney from
outside the staff to be the General Counsel. I was fortunate to be in the right place at the right
time and I got the job as his secretary. It was a very interesting and busy time. I later worked
with one of GM's first female executives. She became the Corporate Secretary and we worked
chiefly on Board matters and the annual stockholders’ meeting. The Board was (and still is)
composed of some top executives of major corporations, so that was also exciting. Those years,
and being involved with the Manhattan Project, is something that I reflect back on with some
pride.

SH: What types of things go on with the legal staff? You wouldn’t think of a car company
having a whole legal staff at hand all the time.
LS: Oh, yes. You can imagine that the largest corporation in the world would need legal advice
on almost everything except actually designing and building the cars. Corporate law may seem
dull, but it is really extremely interesting and diverse. Corporate governance is complex and
involves everything from antitrust, government agencies, all aspects of finance and insurance,
personnel, and a lot of litigation. The overseas division and Treasurer's office were in New York
and were very big. Later, along came class actions.
SH: So it was a headquarters situation that covered all the plants.
LS: The legal staff. There was a staff in Detroit also and a staff in New York, so we handled
more of the things that went on in the East and Detroit did a lot of the other.
SI: Did the legal staff have to handle any of the dealings with the auto unions?
LS: In Detroit, yes. That was a big function there. That was a really an ongoing situation.
Those things go on from one end of the year to the other, one year to the next.
SI: Were you ever in a union, such as a secretaries union? Were you ever in that or any kind of
union?
LS: Well, there was always a sense the union was very strong with the auto workers. There was
always an effort to unionize the clerical and the white-collar, and that never succeeded, we were
never unionized. I remember when there were strikes and they would picket the building, but I
think that happened just before I arrived on the scene. I don’t remember that there were pickets.
There was a big, there were a lot of anti-trusts. That was actually the big thrust of the legal
work in New York was anti-trust, the break up of GM and Dupont and all of that.
SI: One of the things that I’ve always read about corporations in the 1950s and even in the early
'60s was, particularly IBM, it was almost like a corporate family that imposed strict
regimentation on its employees. Did you notice any of that at GM?
LS: No, but it was it certainly was a corporate family. Yes, it was a very strong tie in
relationships between employer and employee. We were well looked after; there was a lot of
respect between employer and the employee. I remember IBM, actually they were the ones
under Watson, where the men had to wear blue suits and so forth, white shirts, but GM was not
regimented to that extent.
SI: Were there corporate get-togethers, picnics, dinners, that sort of thing?
LS: No, no events sponsored at a corporate level. Each department did their own thing. The
legal staff hosted a beautiful luncheon for the secretaries at Christmas-time at a top restaurant or
hotel which would be attended by the head of the staff or another attorney. Some departments
would have office Christmas parties, but we never did. The corporation sponsored a chorus at

15

one time and they would have a yearly concert and reception to which we were invited. There
were also bowling leagues and softball teams. New York is not as company-oriented as Detroit,
partly because the employees do not live close to each other or to the office.
-----------------------------------END OF SIDE ONE, TAPE ONE-------------------------------SI: Okay, we’ve been looking at your two pins, the atomic bomb and the Army-Navy emblem.
We were curious if there was any kind of ceremony or anything associated with giving them out.
LS: No, I don’t remember anything special. The head of the department had x number of pins
and handed them out, gave us a certificate, and it was work as usual. I don’t recall anyone from
the government.
SI: Has there ever been any kind of ceremony?
LS: Reunion?
SI: Yes.
LS: No.
SI: No reunion?
LS: No.
SI: Since there have been a lot of ceremonies recently with the fiftieth anniversary of the atomic
bomb, has there ever been any recognition?
LS: No, I’m sure they lost track of us.
SI: Have you ever had anything through Columbia University?
LS: No, no, it was strictly a government project, you know. Columbia, per se, I don’t think they
had any records. They were probably all government records and heaven only knows probably
blew them up with the bomb, dropped them over Hiroshima.
SI: How did you and Mr. Saldarini meet and marry?
LS: Well, as he pointed out, his aunt had a summer, well, she had residence at the beach, and I
used to go down with a friend of mine and he would be there with his friends and that’s how we
met. … We would double date with some of his friends and one thing led to the other.
SI: What have been your interests recently, since you’ve retired from GM?
LS: One of the first things I did was to volunteer with the Chamber Music Society at Lincoln
Center. I was involved with the free classical music concerts the Society did for New York City

16

school children; I assisted staff members with office work and worked on the organization of
some of the special fund-raising events. Both Joe and I are fond of chamber music and have
been Friends of the Society and subscribers for some twenty years. There, again, I have met
some interesting people, both in and out of the music world. I am indulging in another passion
of mine - poetry and literature - by attending lectures and discussion groups; and I am also
actively involved with a poetry series in our apartment building. I was interested to learn that the
past Poet Laureate, Robert Pinskey, is a Rutgers graduate; I like his poetry very much and
believe he has done a lot to popularize poetry. Joe and I also travel quite extensively and I have
accompanied him on his volunteer executive assignments overseas. Both of us go into New
York a couple of times a month. This is the best part of the country in which to retire - never a
dull moment. It's not been a dull life, either.
SI: Do you visit the art museums?
LS: Oh, yes, yes, go to the theater, the opera, concerts.
SI: What other poets do you read besides Robert Pinsky?
LS: Well, I did take a course in the modern poetry, but not the rap or the café types, so
everything from Yeats and TS Eliot. I’m doing some of the eighteenth century poets now.
SI: Where did you take your courses?
LS: At Fairleigh Dickinson University in Hackensack, Teaneck- Hackensack, which is close to
home.
SI: Is this since you've retired?
LS: Yes. If I lived in the New Brunswick area, I’d be on Rutgers Campus, frequently. See, that
was my mistake. I always thought I never wanted to be a teacher, and now at this point in my
life, I think that is what I should’ve done, stayed in academe.
SI: Do you have any more questions? Do you think there is anything we have forgotten to ask
you?
LS: No, I don’t think so. I’ve enjoyed talking to you, and I hope I’ve given you some insight
into what is was like being in New York and working on the atomic bomb project.
SI: Absolutely.
LS: I thank you.
SI: Thank you very much actually.
LS: My pleasure.
