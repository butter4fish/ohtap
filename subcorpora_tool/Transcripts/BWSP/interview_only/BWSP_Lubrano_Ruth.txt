Jane: [00:00:00] I’m talking to Ruth Lubrano in her very sunny apartment at 207 Medway Place.
Hello, Ruth.

Ruth Lubrano: Hello. I’m glad to meet you, Jane.

J: Good. It’s a pleasure to be here. What class were you at Pembroke?

RL: I was in a very famous class called 1923.

J: What was so famous about it?

RL: Oh, because we had a great bunch of young people who were delighted to be at Brown
because they had just – I don’t know how long they had started accepting – do you know when
they started accepting women?

J: Well, Pembroke was founded in the late 1890s, so it’s 25 or so years, 20 years.

RL: Well, then perhaps ours was a good-sized class then, [00:01:00] 1923. Yeah, and I
remember my father speaking to me when I graduated from Cranston High School, and he – I
asked him – at those times, you respected – your parents, you know, did all of the planning for
you. Young people now do the planning. But I remember speaking to him in August, saying did
he have any particular plans for the future for me because I had just graduated, and he seemed

1

astounded to think that I would ask such a question. He said, “Of course. You’re going to go to
Pembroke.” I had not made any inquiries – this was August – had no idea whether they would
accept me or not. Of course, in those days, you did not have to take [00:02:00] examinations to
get in. If you were an A-B student, you’d get in, but I wasn’t aware of all of that. I wondered
when he said that to me, “Well, will they take me? Yes, you want to send me, but will they take
me?” And bless their hearts, they did. [laughs] Wasn’t that great?

J: That’s great. Did you have to have an interview with one of the deans?
RL: I do not recall that I even had – they accepted the credentials that were asked for. Of course,
I perhaps did not make the final arrangements myself. It might have been left to my dad. My
mother had died when I was very young.

J: Can you remember the first day or the first week you were at Pembroke?

RL: Not the first day, no, it’s all together as one now.

J: What do you remember then?

RL: About going? [00:03:00]
J: About – maybe about the freshman year.

RL: About the freshman year? That’s a hard question. I guess just getting acquainted with the
difference from high school, you know, and the fact that we – there was a little segregation there,
because we girls had to have our classes there at Pembroke Hall. I had been used to – actually, in
high school, at one time I sat in a classroom right next to my future husband. I didn’t know it at
the time, but he turned out to be. Whereas at Brown, in 1919 anyway, you just didn’t go over and
mingle with the young men freely as they [00:04:00] can do now, which is wonderful now, so it
was mostly a little bit of a change to almost all girls there. We did have one class over on the
men’s campus, and that was in biology. I forget her name now, but anyway.

2

J: You had a woman professor for that.

RL: Yes, we did, so we had to go over there, but the rest of our classes the professors came over
to Pembroke Hall.

J: Were they all men?

RL: I beg your pardon.

J: Were they all men?

RL: No. They were old men, did you say?

J: Were all of them men?

RL: All of them men. As I recall, yes. I do not recall any.

J: But you remember some of the deans, like Dean Allinson.

RL: Oh, Allinson, she was a tall, wonderful poetess herself. [00:05:00] She could recite poetry.
She always gave the morning Chapel address, and I’m afraid that we girls didn’t quite appreciate
the message that she had to give us until later. But as far as I’m concerned, I sometimes
remembered some of those little talks that she gave, which were very potent and helpful. She was
understanding, a (inaudible) sort of person, friendly. And we had Dean King, Dean King, Dean
Allinson, and Dean Lewis, I think, was the third one. I’m not positive now, because my memory
has slipped.

J: I think it was Lewis.

RL: My memory is not as good as it should be.

3

J: It’s pretty good. [00:06:00] Do you remember the other two, Dean Lewis and Dean King? Do
you remember what they looked like? Dean Lewis and Dean King, what do you remember about
them?

RL: Apparently they didn’t impress me like Dean Allinson did. [laughs] But they were younger
than she and, I would say, had not had the experience perhaps with youth. Dean Allinson
introduced me to college life, and I guess that’s why it impressed me so much.

J: Did you have gym class? Did you have to go to a gym class? [00:07:00]

RL: Oh, yes, and we wore bloomers. [laughs] That’s where you got acquainted with all the girls,
where there were more girl talk groups at the gym class, of course, while, you know, getting
dressed into these (inaudible) bloomer type of things. Do you want to hear about the Maypole
dance?

J: I do. Yes.

RL: [laughs] Well, in the springtime, as spring approached, great fun preparing for Maypole
Day, May Day, it was. And the Maypole dance, I can remember dancing in that Maypole dance,
and really it was kind of kids’ stuff. But at the time, we thought it was quite professional. Now
that I look back on it, “What are you doing in college, [00:08:00] running around a maypole?”
It’s stupid, but it wasn’t at the time. It was, I guess, just a little bit of post-high-school thing,
beginning-college thing, getting us acquainted.
J: So did – was it just the freshmen that did the Maypole dance?

RL: Now, I can’t give you the correct answer to that. Whatever class was going to graduate that
year, I would think, however I’m not positive about it.

J: Did you wear special clothes?

4

RL: Oh, yes, we were dressed up properly, good-looking, nicely dressed.

J: Like what?

RL: You know, well, like a May Day queen.

J: Was the same true for Ivy Day?

RL: [00:09:00] Ivy Day, what is that?

J: It was at commencement or near commencement when they would process with the ivy.

RL: With the ivy. I can’t recall whether that was just commencement or a special day. I think it
might be a special day rather than commencement, because I don’t recall having that chain on
the commencement when we marched down the hill. We graduated, you know, with the Brown
group.

J: And your degree was from Brown.

RL: Yeah, and we all had the black woolen robes, as I recall. Now I think they’re a little thinner
material, isn’t it?

J: And you were [00:10:00] good at bowling.

RL: Oh, yes, I think at one time I was captain, but I’m not too sure. I’m pretty sure I was, but I
liked it and could do it well. We played fistball, too, in those days. I don’t think they play that
now, do they?

J: It’s a bit like volleyball?

5

RL: It’s similar. It’s somewhat like volleyball I guess. Yeah.

J: And the bowling alley was where?

RL: Right there at Pembroke Hall. Isn’t it there anymore?

J: Wasn’t it in the Sayles Gym?

RL: Sayles Gym, yes. Oh, yes, of course it wasn’t in Pembroke Hall. Pembroke Hall, when we
went in downstairs, we did not have a nice lunchroom like they have in Alumnae Hall now. We
had – it seems to me it was just – all I can think of is sort of a dark room [00:11:00] and round
tables, and that is where a nucleus of girls would get together, and a group would form. And that
little group that formed around the round table that I sat at stayed together closely after we
graduated. I guess it was natural, because we were there most of the time each day at about the
same time, even though it was dark and you just had your sandwiches or whatever. I think they
served – the unhappy thing that I remember about that place was that we had lockers where we
could put our books and things, and, as I told you, my mother died when I was three. [00:12:00]
My father gave me her watch, and I used to take it to college, and somebody took it from my
locker, so I have an unhappy thought about that locker room. I know it was a dark room. It was
in the dark room that I discovered that that had been taken.

J: So you were a City Girl.

RL: I was a City Girl.
J: And did you take your lunch, then, with you from home, or did you –

RL: Yeah, I don’t think they sold much of anything. It was very simple, not meals anyway. It
might have been just, you know, like – funny, I don’t remember that. I just remember that there
was somebody standing there, and you could get a drink of some kind, and sitting around the
table.

6

J: Did they have tablecloths?

RL: [00:13:00] Oh, no. [laughs]

J: No?
RL: This was in the dark basement of Pembroke Hall, and those three stairs, three – running up
those stairs to get up to the hall, which is not a hall now, but that’s where we had our morning
session every morning, and you had to be there. Attendance was taken.

J: So was that on the same floor as where the deans’ offices are or further up? The deans’ offices,
if you come in from Meeting Street up the steps –

RL: Meeting Street?
J: – the first floor, that floor you come to, is where the deans’ offices used to be.
RL: I think they were still – they were there. I’m not too sure. That’s –

J: Did you use the library?
RL: We didn’t – [00:14:00] as I recall, we didn’t have a library of our own. It seemed to me we
went over to the John Hay all the time for books. We were allowed there, but we just weren’t
allowed to communicate with the men while we were in the library.

J: You just weren’t supposed to talk to them.
RL: No, you’re not supposed to say good – well, I suppose you could say good morning, but, you
know, you weren’t to get together or sit together and have a friendly conversation. You just
behaved yourself.

7

J: So you had most of your classes in Pembroke Hall?

RL: Yes.
J: Do you remember –
RL: Biology in – as I told you, over at the campus, but we didn’t have – I think I had geology
over at Brown too. Yeah, I’m pretty sure, geology and biology [00:15:00] over there, but most of
your classes the professors came to Pembroke Hall. Of course, our classes weren’t very large
anyway.

J: How large?
RL: Well, I would –

J: 10, 15, 20?

RL: Probably 10, 15, not 25 or 30 except for, like, maybe the biology one. Major Wilder, that’s
her name, biology.

J: Magel Wilder.

RL: She was a professor there at that time. She’s the one. That’s the trouble with old memory. It
comes a little while later. [laughs]

J: It’s very good. Now, what did you major in? What was your major?
RL: The social sciences, [00:16:00] yeah. I thought at one time that I’d like to be a – I was very
active in the Congregational church, and I thought at one time I might like to go to a foreign
country and try my skills when I completed college. But before I even left college, in my senior

8

year near graduation somebody came to me and asked if I’d be interested in assisting as a
psychiatric social worker. I said, “I don’t know a thing about it,” and they said, “Well, that’s all
right. The doctors there will give you a training session, and you’ll be working under an
experienced person anyway.” So that’s what I did. [00:17:00] I never had to go looking for a
position actually in my whole life. By the time I was through doing that and getting married and
anything else, somebody else was after me for another – well, social workers, the school at that
time had – to become a social worker, you were just starting to have to get a master’s degree.
And I graduated just at the time when that was not required. All I had was a bachelor of arts, and
I was a very fortunate girl to get into positions that really should have required somebody with a
little more brainpower than I had. [laughs] [00:18:00] I gave them what I had. That’s it. It might
not have been a master’s, but they accepted it.

J: Where were you working with that first job? Where was it?

RL: The state hospital for mental diseases.

J: And that was in Cranston?

RL: Out in Cranston. Howard, they would have called it.

J: What was that like?

RL: Oh, I lived there. And for the first couple of months, it was a little scary, because we would
hear noises that we were not accustomed to hearing. But it worked out, a good learning place for
me, and I happened to have a wonderful teacher, and the doctors were very kind to this young
kid just out of college that didn’t know much of anything, definitely not in the field in which I
started to work. [00:19:00]

J: What did you have to do?

9

RL: Personal work with different patients who were being released home and getting adjusted to
home life again, say, somebody that got depressed for instance because bills had mounted up and
other things had mounted up, and had needed mental care and attention and, after a period of
time at the hospital, was ready to go back. So my help would be – this is just one case – assisting
in readjustment to home life again. You know, bills must be paid. You can’t have them mount up
so that it becomes a worry to you, [00:20:00] as an example.
J: So you’d go –

RL: There was plenty to do.
J: – you’d go to their houses or –

RL: Oh, to their houses, yes.

J: Yeah.
RL: And at that time, we had a chauffeur there who took us to – I didn’t have to drive. It was a
chauffeur who took us around to wherever we had to go. We had to have a police whistle with
us, because sometimes there would be night calls and sometimes in areas that were not safe for a
young kid like myself to be traveling.

J: Did you go on your own to these houses?

RL: Oh, yes, yes. Oh, yes. That’s what the assistant was supposed to do, good training.

J: How long did you do that job?

RL: Two years, anyway, and I left to get married. I think that’s what happened. [00:21:00] I’m
pretty sure that’s what happened, because I –

10

J: Were you not allowed to do that job if you were married?

RL: I beg your pardon.

J: Did you have to leave because you were getting married?

RL: No.

Katherine: You took another job.

RL: I’m trying to think of what I went into next.

K: Planned Parenthood.
RL: What? Oh, that wasn’t until 1938, ’38 to ’58, and I stayed until ’25. What was I doing?
Well, I had David for one thing, and I certainly was not working. I was not working at the – I
was doing something else. I’m trying to think of what that was, maybe just volunteer work and
activities in the library clubs and [00:22:00] Pembroke – I joined the Pembroke reading group. In
1928, I think, it started, and I stayed with it until it expired altogether and met some wonderful
Pembrokers in that way. We became lifelong friends, and that Pembroke reading group was very
active, a fine group of women, and I’m – it was a relationship that I treasured very much.

J: Did it meet at Pembroke?

RL: No, we met in each other’s homes. There was one girl who made the most delicious
refreshments you ever ate. I can still taste them. [laughs] Irma Cull on Blackstone Boulevard, a
Pembroker.
J: [00:23:00] And so you would read something and discuss it, read a book and –

11

RL: One person read the book, and then we would make any remarks we wanted to about it, but
we didn’t have to review it at all. I believe that later when they took over after I retired from it
that – no, I stayed with that group right until the end. I forget. I think it was in the ’70s that it
broke up. I’m not too sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be.

J: And you worked for the Birth Control League for 20 years?

RL: 1938 to 1958.

J: Tell me about that. [00:24:00]

RL: Well, when I first started at the little place, that was just about opening. There had never
been anything like Planned Parenthood, and it was a no-no subject publicly, no publicity to speak
of. If any of the educators in that particular kind of work attempted anything publicly, they were
shushed. So, gradually, it became accepted a little. It was not called Planned Parenthood. It was
called the Maternal Health – Rhode Island Maternal Health, so that was more acceptable as a
name, but the main function was for [00:25:00] birth control and health education as far as
reproductive organs are concerned. And that was on North Main Street, where we had plenty of
little rats running around the floor.

J: Really?

RL: [laughs] Yes. And then, after quite a few years, it got a very nice place further up
Westminster Street, just beyond – I wonder what the name of that street is that crosses
Westminster and Washington Street further up.

J: Dorrance?

RL: Further up, beyond, parallel with Dorrance only further up. Dorrance, Madison, and then the
next one.

12

M1: Empire.

J: Empire?

RL: Empire, good for you. Go to the head of the class. [00:26:00] [laughs]

K: Grandma, tell Jane about what you did with your position at Planned Parenthood when they
approached you about wanting you back after Dad was born, because you did it on your terms,
which was pretty interesting.
RL: Oh, yeah, it involved another – they came to me and asked if I would take over the –
because the social worker there at Maternal Health at that time was retiring, they’d like to have
me. And my son was seven years old, and I said, “No,” that I could not do that, because I needed
to be at home with my son. And they said – oh, no, I said to them, “I think I would be interested
[00:27:00] if there was somebody who would take over part of the time, like, two and a half days
or something like that.” But to be away a whole week, I did not. So the next thing I knew, they
came to me again and said, “Well, we’ve found somebody who’d like to do the two and a half
days with you,” and she was somebody I knew from Pembroke, Edna [Bellon?], and a good
social worker. I think she was with family welfare at the time, but I’m not sure. Anyway, she was
pleased to go into part-time work with me, and the two of us took over the running of Maternal
Health at the time for quite some time until I retired in 1958. By that time, it was Planned
Parenthood. It was beginning to be accepted a little bit more. [00:28:00] It was still a little shady.
[laughs]

J: Right. So it’s interesting that they had this in such a Roman Catholic state. Was the church
making objections or members of the church to what you were doing?

RL: Oh, well, yes, it was against their religion. I remember distinctly one girl I became very fond
of. Maybe I ought not to tell you this. This is off the record. This girl was very upset about
coming for birth control information, but she had a family of, I think, four children already and
just didn’t want to face any more. So, anyway, I think she got along with us very nicely for a

13

couple of years, and then she came back and [00:29:00] said she was sorry, but she wouldn’t be
seeing us anymore because she had been to confession, and it really was going against her grain,
her religious faith, to continue. And the next sad thing that I heard about her was that she did
become pregnant. She had been advised not to have more anyway. That’s why she came in the
first place. And she had died. And that bothered me very much, because I knew that the members
of the church that she belonged to would not be happy to hear that a person going against –
because she did what she felt was helpful for her children, to be a mother there, [00:30:00] stay a
while for her children, had to lose her life because she denied it, because she wanted to keep with
her faith. But that was her belief, and you just had to accept it, that that meant more to her. It
didn’t mean more to her, but in a way it did, I guess.

J: Who were the people behind the foundation of the Maternal Health League? Who was on the
board? Who were the founders of it?

RL: Oh, great folks.
J: Like who?
RL: Yeah. In fact –

J: What sort of people?
RL: – who lived here – I’ve forgotten her name, a dear, dear person. I know her as well as I
know her name.

K: Who lived in Medway?

RL: Yeah, lived in Medway here, [00:31:00] and there was another doctor’s wife. They were all
people – as the same is true that there were people, well-educated, with high social standing in
the community who were on boards that also believed in what Maternal Health – because it
involved not only giving birth control, but it also gave information on general maternal health.
So it was folks like that, [Lyle?], Mrs. Richard Lyle. Did you know her?

14

J: Mrs. Lyle, yeah.

RL: Yes. Well, she was the president of it at one time, a very fine person. [00:32:00] She lived
up on the third floor here.

J: She was down in the corner there.

RL: Yeah. You did know her personally?

J: I interviewed her when I did the book about the Providence Athenaeum.

RL: Ah, yes. [laughs]

J: And Rush Sturges was involved in it.

RL: Yes, let me see, Rush Sturges may have. I wouldn’t be a bit surprised, because there was a
whole nucleus of those – they were great women.
J: In the 1930s, when the Depression was on –

RL: The Depression was awful. Yes, I was working at that time.
J: In mental health at that time? In the mental health or –

RL: Yes, because I worked until 1958, 20 years, [00:33:00] the good part of my life was spent
with – it wasn’t Planned Parenthood then. It was called Maternal Health. When we moved up,
further up on Westminster Street, that was a nice office just beyond Empire – thank you – and,
yeah, they branched out a little more. And we had, at that time – as years went on, they did have
somebody who would have charge of going out to give a talk to the general public about what
the foundation wanted to do and so forth, so we were much more organized than way, way back.

15

It was just beginning when I went into it. It had been in existence, though, for a few years before
I [00:34:00] joined. Good experience.

J: Yes. I just have a couple more questions. To go right back to when you were at Pembroke, you
were there in 1919, which was the time of the great influenza epidemic.

RL: Oh, yes.

J: Did it affect the girls at Pembroke?
RL: Well, let’s put it this way. If it did, it didn’t bother me. [laughs] I wasn’t – yes, I was
concerned about it, because, you know, it was awful, the deaths from it, because it was
worldwide almost. You couldn’t help but become involved. But as far as my little life was
concerned, [00:35:00] we were doing fine, I guess. Let’s put it this way, that I was very aware of
it. The Depression impressed me a great deal more than the epidemic of influenza, although that
was a worldwide spread. The Depression was so sad, to see all of these men leaning on their
shovels, and I believe they got a minimum salary of something like $13.75 a week or something
like that. It was so sad.
J: Did it –
RL: And also, I think it was during that time, too, that – or was it during the wars? I guess it was
during the wars. I had a few wars to live through where we had to not – you know, you didn’t
have [00:36:00] butter and meat and so forth. I can remember making so many nut loaves instead
of meat loaves, but the nuts took that place. [laughs] But I wouldn’t want to look at nut loaf now,
believe me. And the Depression was very difficult for people, sad.

J: Was it difficult for you personally?

16

RL: No, no. Well, to the extent that you were aware of the Depression around you. You can’t
help it affecting the way you live and the way you enjoy life, so to speak, with all of this sorrow
around you. No.

J: Where were you living then?
RL: The Depression, I believe [00:37:00] I was married and living in Cranston where we – we
bought a house there. My husband went into school-teaching, got his master’s from Brown, and
he did his – well, Hope Street High while he was getting his master’s, and that’s when we got
married. And I think – what was his salary at the time? [laughs] You’d be surprised. We lived on
a little bit of nothing that first year, but it was a furnished apartment on Charlesfield Street, and it
was a happy year even though it was kind of slim financially. And then, he had a position to
work in Cranston High School, and he was with the Cranston department for quite a little while,
[00:38:00] and he was taken quite sick. And after his illness was – he used to come up to Brown.
He loved Brown, Moses Brown and Brown he loved, and it was while he was walking around at
the campus and during his leisure years because of his illness that he came and talked with one of
his professors that he was very fond of. And the professor said, “It just so happens that I’m
looking for somebody to take over the laboratory in the physics department.” They had not had
somebody specifically for the lab work, plenty of professors but not supervising all of the lab,
and he said, “How would you like to come in and try it out?” [00:39:00] So, of course, he
jumped at the chance, and also his hearing was extremely bad. And there’s no discipline in the
college, so that relationship with college students who want to learn and high school students
who’d just as soon omit part of it and do a little whispering or so was quite different. It was
easier for him, and he loved teaching. So he tried and had 18 years of a very fine relationship at
Brown in the physics department, and of course I enjoyed that, too, because I was back to
Brown, too, good old Brown. Many of my happy relationships have been with Brown people.

J: That’s good.

RL: And so I was [00:40:00] proud to have a son who went to Brown and a granddaughter who
went to Brown. I didn’t think that was going to happen, because before she decided the other

17

four decided on others. So it was very nice that [Katherine?] decided on Brown. Wasn’t it,
Katherine? And you have been very happy there.

K: Very.

RL: And you met somebody there who eventually became a happy husband for you.

K: Yeah.
RL: So things were a little bit different in your day I’m sure, because Miller – there was only one
– when I first went there, there was just one dorm. And then, it was Metcalf, the first one, and
then Miller, or vice versa. I think it was Metcalf first, and then they built Miller, but it might be
just the opposite. [00:41:00] I can’t say. So then, that came as two, and then they even then went
on and had to get another. How many dorms do they have now, all over the place?

J: And you helped build Alumnae Hall.
RL: Oh, yeah, selling – our class did, selling woolen blankets for $25 a blanket, and I’ve still got
one of those blankets. I really should have gotten it out if I could find it.

J: Where did you get the woolen blankets from to sell?
RL: I don’t know where we got them. Somebody must have contacted somebody that – you
know, by word of mouth from somebody. [laughs] Yeah.

J: So, in your day, where did the City Girls spend their social time?

RL: [00:42:00] Well, around the campus, I mean, as far as college was concerned, with what
activities that we did outside of the lectures, the athletic things that we went into, and I think we
had gradually – not so much the freshman year but, it seems to me, at least the junior and senior
year, maybe because I was more active with the Brown men then – we went over to their social

18

activities quite a bit, and they used to have very long dances that would begin early in the
evening and that would last [00:43:00] – I can remember a whole group of young folks walking
down College Hill at two o’clock in the morning singing the Brown songs, you know. We would
go to – what was that Chinese place that would always have pancakes for us? Just almost like
high school kids, really, that’s what we acted – not certainly like the sophisticated college people
are today. That is, I think they are.
J: You went to dances on the –

RL: Oh, yes. Oh, very formal, very formal, in Sayles Hall, long dresses. There used to be a joke
about the Pembroke girls that had to – it’s beside the point – had to check in their corsets before
they could go to the dance. [00:44:00] [laughs] You know, that’s just kid talk. That wasn’t true,
but that’s what the kid – that was, “Oh, did you check in your corset?” [laughs] Crazy.

J: Did you go to other social activities with the Brown men?
RL: With the Brown – other than dances and so forth? It doesn’t seem to me that they had the
lectures open to the public the way they do now and did in my later years of life, which I’ve
enjoyed a great deal, and I’ve – Pembroke Club always and still does sponsor a series of lectures
in the spring and in the fall. And up until two years ago or three years ago, I had to drop out. I
can’t drive anymore, eyes and a few other reasons. [00:45:00]

J: Did you go to the football games?
RL: Oh, yes, yes. Now, I don’t remember going so much as a young – but that would be because
of me and that I wasn’t – it was because I lived out in Edgewood more than right here where I’m
sure the dorm girls must have done that. There were games, and we would have social activities
of our own where we could invite them to.

J: What sort of social activities? What sort of social activities?

19

RL: Well, I can remember having tea parties of some kind. [laughs] Well, [Carr’s?] served the
most – they would have the most delicious cakes, and, boy, they sure knew how to do it, and we
loved to go [00:46:00] and have those.
J: So you would go to Carr’s to – you’d go and have these tea parties at Carr’s.

RL: I’m not getting your question.

J: So you would have your tea parties at Carr’s.

RL: At the college, yes.

J: No, at Carr’s tea shop.
RL: Oh, not at the – no, no, here.

J: No?
RL: At Pembroke I mean, at Pembroke. Oh, yeah, we had – oh, the silver tea set was out quite
frequently for some of the parties, quite formal.

J: White gloves?

RL: But it was nice. Oh, yes, I think I still have some of those gloves that you’d wear way up the
– [laughs] yeah, quite formal.

J: That’s great.

RL: But it was fun.
J: So what – in conclusion, what was the best thing about going to Brown, going to Pembroke?

20

RL: [00:47:00] Well, of course, I should say primarily what your brain could absorb, [laughs] but
I don’t know as that is primarily – yes, it is, of course, because through knowledge, then your
contacts with the larger part of the community and of the community with the world. I remember
even – well, a class that I took that I had to go into different agencies, you know, to take down
information on different things connected with the way they ran their business and all. It was all
a part of enlargement of not just what this area is doing but what is going on. [00:48:00] But we
weren’t as world-conscious. I can remember my father calling me. We lived in a big house that
had three stories, and the children had their bedrooms on the third floor, and I – one afternoon, I
could hear my father down on the first floor calling me to, “Get down here. Get down here.” I
thought the house was on fire. I hurried down. “What’s the matter?” “I’ve got channel so-and-so
on the radio from Chicago.” It was a big thing, and I can remember riding in a Stanley Steamer,
too, one of the first ones that came out.

J: What’s a Stanley Steamer?

RL: You don’t know a Stanley Steamer?

J: No.

RL: Oh, you’re not educated. That’s one of the first automobiles, and it caught on fire very
easily. [00:49:00] [laughs] And it did while I was in it, and I got out of it in a hurry and ran
home.

J: How old were you then?

RL: Oh, I must have been very young, because I don’t remember it distinctly, but that episode
isn’t something that – some of the episodes I remember because somebody else told me, but this
episode I remember, jumping out of that car and running from that fire. I could tell you just
where it happened too. I think I must have been six years old. When did the Stanley Steamer

21

come out? Do you know? One of the first automo– how about you? Do you know automobiles?
When did they –

M1: I don’t know the Stanley Steamer. [laughs]

RL: You didn’t hear about Stanley Steamers?

K: Sometime before 1910.

RL: [laughs] Oh, yeah, it was before 1910 I’m pretty sure. I would think, yeah, one of the first
ones, [00:50:00] I guess, long before Ford came into being. But it must have –

J: So what year were you born?

RL: 1901.

J: 1901.

RL: Nineteen-oh-one.

K: And my grandfather in 1899.
J: Eighteen –

K: He lived in three centuries.

RL: Yeah.

J: That’s amazing.

22

RL: So the young people today, for me to get contact with – well, look at getting Chicago on the
radio being a big thing, how my father would be delighted to think that we contacted the Moon
or that we’re so easy to get wherever, Timbuktu, nowadays, never mind the – oh, boy, he would
love it. [laughs]

J: Well, this has been terrific. Thank you very, very much.
RL: [laughs] [00:51:00] I’m sorry I didn’t remember all of the things I – and probably half of it
is all my imagination.

J: Well, you remembered so much that’s really interesting. Thank you very, very much.

RL: Oh, you’re entirely welcome.
