LB: And say some – (laughter) is that on there now?
Q: Yup. OK, that’s your say, now you say –
LB: I’m –
Q: OK. Well, I guess maybe we should start by asking why – for both of you, why you went to
college in the first place and why you went to Pembroke.
LB: Judy, my daughter, was here last night, and I said – and you – well, you and I talked about it,
but I have no recollection of it ever being discussed at home with my parents that I should go to
college. You just went. (laughter) Don’t you think so?
RP: Well, I think that was true in certain cases.
LB: Yes, of course.
RP: Well, I – lots of us who had been encouraged by high school teachers [then tried it?]. And I
know that when I was doing [concert?] work, you know, I was supposed to end my education at
the end of high school, because I was going to do some concert work, and my teacher said that
you couldn’t do both, and my father put his foot down [01:00] on that and said “You’re going to

1

college, and you can do everything you want to after that.” And I did all my concert work right
there in college.
LB: And she kept her music up, her practicing, and I told you, she composed the music for the
songs –
RP: Yes, and I played the piano.
LB: Yes.
RP: And we had these inter-class sings, you know, and we always won the cup, or whatever it
was we got for the prize. Remember when we had these choruses, and we –
LB: Contests. Song contests.
RP: Song contests, that was it.
LB: For – the [Po Four?] classes had made up or – anyway, songs and music; I don't know
whether they all did that, but they all had songs to sing. And me, I know that we did this in an
evening up in Pembroke Hall, which I guess is the library or something up there –
Q: Mm-hmm.
LB: – well, that was our chapel, you know, up there. And we – all of us that would want to be in
it and sing, we’d all be arranged around the stage, and Rose and I were [02:00] so proud because,
you know, here we – our freshman year we got the award.
Q: Did you write the songs?
LB: Yes, yes.

2

RP: I wrote the songs.
LB: [I met two at one stop?] – I’ll see if the song book is over there. Well, we got that song
contest award the whole four years we were in college.
Q: Because you wrote the songs.
RP: I wrote the songs and played for them.
LB: And then –
Q: So did you write the words and the music?
RP: No, I didn’t write the words.
LB: No, well, May [Spirey?], another classmate who has long since died, she wrote the words.
RP: And Dorothy Allen wrote some too.
LB: Yes, Dorothy Allen did some of them, some of them.
RP: Well, I wrote all the music. Whatever else we sang, I don't know, whether some old-timers
or what – or what the other classes sang. And of course we also had a sophomore masque, and
what were some of the other things we had? We had...
LB: Have you heard about the sophomore masque?
Q: Well, I wanted that – that was one of the things on my list I wanted to ask you about, because
I’ve read about these sophomore masques –

3

LB: Well, every class had it in the sophomore year. [03:00] And that, there was no music,
because it was outdoors.
RP: That’s right.
LB: But [Ann Terry?] and somebody else wrote – Ann Terry White, she is; she’s alive, down in
Connecticut somewhere, Stamford. They wrote, she – Ann and someone – wrote the masque.
Q: But what was the masque? Was it like a play, or what was it?
RP: It was almost Renaissance. (laughter) And English, you know.
LB: Yes, we all had the funniest costumes you ever saw. What were you?
RP: Gosh, I don’t remember.
LB: Well, I was Venus, and I stood – they had fixed something that looked like I was coming out
of a shell.
RP: Oh, a Botticelli. Botticelli, the Venus coming out.
LB: Yes.
RP: The Birth of Venus. You know that picture of Botticelli of Venus coming out of the shell?
LB: Coming out. Well, some of them, I don’t – Esteban and Isabel Taylor were rabbits.
RP: Oh, yes.
LB: And they had rabbit costumes. Oh, everybody – I think the whole class was supposed to be
in it. [04:00]
4

Q: Was it supposed to be a comedy thing, or –?
LB: Well, I really don’t know how the substance of the thing – do you? (overlapping dialogue;
inaudible)
RP: I don’t remember. It went back to the early plays in England, you know, that kind of thing.
That’s what I thought it was, anyway.
LB: Well, I’ve lost this –
RP: And then we used to have May Day, do you remember?
LB: Oh, yes. Every year, the first of May. Every –
Q: Was that the same thing as Ivy Day?
LB: No, no, this is – we had a big maypole with all the, you know, these –
RP: Ribbons.
LB: – ribbons and things, and we danced around the maypole, (laughter) and one year, Helen
[Maurie?] and I were dressed up as sailors, as [dogs?] in white – their white summer suits. And
we had to borrow them from somebody we knew, and we did the hornpipe, and somewhere I
have a snapshot of the two of us in one position of the hornpipe, Helen Maurie and I. And this
Helen Maurie, she lives up [05:00] outside of Boston. She made – I bet she made a lot of money
selling her snapshots – no matter what went on, she would take snapshots. And there was a
bulletin board up in Pembroke Hall, just at the head of the stairs, and that little room was the
professors’ room, where they came in to take off their rubbers, coats and hats and go to class.
And she used to have the snapshots posted on the bulletin board, with a list, a [theme paper?] list

5

with all our names. So you checked what ones you wanted. And I had loads of them, but oh, my,
I don't know – boxes full.
RP: Oh, there were other things that went on, of course, that they don’t do anymore.
Q: What kinds of things?
RP: It’s true. Let’s see, what else, Dorothy? You remember better than I do.
Q: Well, there was something called Ivy Day.
RP: That was when you were a senior.
Q: And what was that?
LB: Well, it was near commencement, wasn’t it?
RP: Yeah, commencement.
LB: About [06:00] a week before. Well, it wasn’t – wasn’t part of commencement, was it?
RP: Well, I guess it was. It preceded commencement, didn’t it? We had this long ivy chain that
we wore over our shoulders, and we marched around –
LB: The Camp Brown – no –
RP: Not Brown, Pembroke.
LB: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) It was the Pembroke campus.
RP: Yes.
6

LB: And somebody would make a speech. They usually had a professor –
RP: That’s right, yes, that’s right.
LB: – who stood on the gym steps, and we were all gathered around.
Q: And then did you plant that ivy into one of the buildings or something like that?
RP: If we did that, I [don’t remember?] –
Q: I thought I saw a picture – I was looking through some old scrapbooks, and I thought I saw a
picture of the class ivy in one of the buildings.
LB: Well, it might be. Well, maybe. I don’t remember.
RP: I think that that [Sales?] Gym where we used to have gym was once covered with ivy. I
think it was,. Now, I don't know whether it is right now, I can’t remember.
LB: No, I haven’t been in through there in three, four years.
RP: But we gave up our Ivy Day when we were seniors.
Q: Why? Because of the war?
RP: Because of the war.
LB: [07:00] We gave up a lot of things. We didn’t – the junior class always had a junior prom,
and we – somebody, whoever was chairman, had sent in for all the things we were going to have
as favors, and then I guess we had a class meeting and we decided – you see, this would have
been the spring of ’17, when United States was beginning to send troops to Europe. And we just
7

felt it wasn’t patriotic. And, I mean, we must have all agreed to this, because is that the day that
we spent in the gym all dressed up like Red Cross nurses?
Q: What was that?
LB: We all had – you know what Red Cross nurses used to wear, a white garment, and we had a
white thing, like a kerchief, and it had a red cross on here. Oh, I had these for years, but I
probably sent them to a rummage sale. But the gym had – was it just our class? It must have been
all the college, because senior class [08:00] was always invited to a junior prom.
RP: Oh, yes, (inaudible).
LB: Well, we had tables or something in the gym, and we worked all day doing what? I don't
know.
RP: Picking oakum.
LB: Is that what we did?
RP: And making bandages for the Red Cross.
Q: Did you used to do that regularly, or did Pembroke?
LB: The oakum, yes. Do you know what oakum is?
Q: No.
LB: No, I’ve said that to several people – even people in our generation say something about,
you know, the things we did in college, and I said, “Oh, we used to pick oakum.” Between
classes, when you had time between classes, you went over to the gym in a room upstairs

8

somewhere, and I don't know what the oakum was in, but it looked like tons of it, and it doesn’t
weigh anything. Well, it’s a tar product –
RP: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) And it smelled.
LB: – residual or something from tar. And it’s very soft, but it has all the little [09:00] specks of
tar in it. You could start out with a bundle that big and pick out – oh, you didn’t get [along?] very
fast, either – pick out all these little tar specks.
RP: Well, what, a quarter of an inch across, was it?
LB: Ad when you got through with a bundle of oakum this big, you’d have a nice soft handful.
And they put it – it went to France, wherever the fighting was going on, mostly in France, I
guess. They’d stuff wounds with it.
Q: So were you required to do that sort of volunteer work?
RP: Well, I don't know that we were required to do it, but that was one of our patriotic –
LB: Yeah.
RP: – services that we did.
LB: And we – whatever – well, I know we bought the favors, because I had a little gray [card?]
case for years – it had a brown [seal?] on it. And whether they could cancel programs and dance
– [10:00] we had dance programs in those days; I don't know, but we had no junior prom. But
you know, 1919, the next year, had one and invited us and it was in Churchill House.
RP: Oh, yes.
LB: And that 1918 – there were many more. The United States was completely involved.
9

Q: And they had but they didn’t forego it?
LB: No, they had it.
RP: No, that was after, I guess, the peace had been signed.
LB: No, it hadn’t. The spring of 1918 –
RP: Oh, probably not. It was in the fall.
LB: Not till November 11th. But we really did a lot. We learned to knit – we used to knit in class.
And I would have thought some professors might have not liked it, but nobody ever – you know,
(inaudible) was lecturing, nobody ever told us not to knit.
RP: No. (inaudible)
LB: We knit scarves, helmets, I don't know what else, for both the Navy and the Army. And it all
went – [11:00] all this came from the Red Cross.
Q: And Miss Presel, you were telling me – when you said you didn’t go over to the Brown
campus with the – on Ivy Day, and it reminded me of something that Miss Presel was telling me
in the car about the girls not being allowed to go over to the Brown campus.
LB: We couldn’t use it for a shortcut to the John [Hay?] Library. We had to go all the way
(inaudible) and around the fence and across the street to the John Hay.
Q: That’s what you were telling me. Yes.

10

LB: And I suppose we could have done it when we were out of college, but I think out of four
years’ habit, when I was out of college, I used to walk around the fence. But we did have classes
when we were upperclassmen.
RP: Well, they wouldn’t let me – the dean wouldn’t let me go on the campus when I was a
sophomore. Do you remember the professor from [Clensa?] when I –
LB: Yes, you told me.
RP: – when I had him for German? He said that I was taking a course that was too easy for me.
[12:00] And so I went in and asked the dean whether she would give me permission to take a
course with the men on the campus, and she said, “No, you are only a sophomore and I cannot
allow you to go on the campus with the – and have a class with the men.” So the professor gave
me extra books to read and more work to do right there. And so I thought that was a little bit
narrow-minded.
LB: Well, a great deal of that – well, it doesn’t matter who hears it, they’re all dead, she’s dead
and they all (inaudible) didn’t know anyway – but a great deal of her ideas were very narrowminded. We had to wear – it was practically the law: if you went to the campus because you had
a class, you had to wear hat and gloves. It was compulsory.
RP: And a veil?
LB: I think so.
Q: This is on the Pembroke campus, or on the Brown campus?
LB: No. When you’re a junior – an upperclassman [13:00] at Pembroke, you could go, you could
take classes with the men, but you also – the dean had to get permission from the professor that
she could send women students.

11

Q: Was this Dean King?
LB: Yes. And I – well, several of us took – well, I guess it was our senior year, we took secondyear Spanish on the hill, and, well, there must have been seven or eight of us in the front row,
and we had AB Johnson –
RP: Oh, yes.
LB: – and the boys, the Brown men sat behind us in the next row. So there were about two rows
of chairs, taking second-year Spanish.
RP: Well, that was AB Johnson, was it? It always struck me, when I had a class – I had French
with him once and I had Spanish with him –
LB: I had French with him.
RP: – but he was – I hope that the Brown professors are a little bit more [university-eyed?], shall
I say.
Q: (laughter)
RP: Because he acted like a high school teacher. [14:00] He had his book, his mark book, in
front of him, and he used to call on us, each one to translate or whatever it was, and he used to
put the mark in the book. And he used to do it in alphabetical order. And we – and only so many
people, of course, during the hour, could be called on. And so we always knew the next day that
the next letter would be those who would be called on. So those are the people who prepared the
work, don’t you see.
Q: Was this – he did this for the Pembroke women and the Brown men, right? It wasn’t – he
didn’t treat people differently?

12

LB: Well, I didn’t have French with the man, did you?
RP: Well, I had him in French and Spanish.
LB: But did you have him in the men’s?
RP: Yes, I think –
LB: A mixed class in one of those (inaudible)?
RP: I think I did. I can’t remember, it’s so long ago. But I know it was in his French class, and
that’s the way – everything was – he didn’t know one from the other, of course, but we sat in
alphabetical order, and if people –
LB: Well, we always did.
RP: – and if people changed their seats, they wouldn’t – couldn’t even tell the difference, of
course.
Q: So he didn’t favor the men over the women [15:00] or the women –
RP: No, I don’t think so. Of course, nowadays, I think there’s a little bit more of a personal
element between students and professor.
LB: Well, we talked about [they?] –
RP: In those days, there was something very impersonal. You know, your professor didn’t know
who in the world you were, that’s all, and if people just changed their seats, he wouldn’t know
who was who.
Q: Was that true of all the professors on Pembroke –?
13

LB: No. I made a note of that – you know, Rose and I talked about it on the telephone. A good
many professors on the Brown faculty while we were in college were much older – I don't know
whether they had to retire, but they really were the last bunch, group, of professors that had been
there for years. And, well, they seemed, some of them, like [Harkness?]. We had Harkness up in
[Latin?]. And he just – well, to a [16:00] 17- or 18-year-old, they just seemed old. And some of
them did leave while we were in college because they, whatever the arrangement was, whether
they had to retire or what. But I don’t think he even looked at the class, this – I don't know what
his name was, but Professor Harkness. He – and in those days, some of the men and women too
walked (inaudible), you know, didn’t have any [girls?] when he had them. All through Latin
class, while we’d be translating, because he was watching the book – I don't know what we were
reading, do you?
RP: No.
LB: And he’d put his little [pictures of a?] (inaudible). And two seconds later he’d take them off.
He did that every few, two-three minutes all through class. Put them on, take them off, and just –
I don’t remember he ever said a word about our translations. And then [17:00] there was – well,
when I took economics – I took an advanced course in economics my senior year, and I was –
King let me go to the hill, and I was the only girl in the class. And it wasn’t a big class, and it
was in the old economics building that they’ve redone and it’s lovely inside, the one that’s got
the dome –
Q: That Robinson Hall, that one?
LB: Yes. And Jim Bennett was in it, [Morty?], Leonard – there were some men in it that I knew.
And Professor Gardner, and he was well along in years as far as I was concerned, he never
looked up at the class. There was no discussion of – we read about students in college today, and
in the monthly it shows, like, a seminar group and the professor is, you know, it’s all very
informal and he seems as interested as the students are. But Mr. Gardner kept his – and it was an

14

awful dark room in that building at the time – [18:00] he just kept his head down and read from
his notes.
Q: Did the Pembroke – I mean, if you were in classes on the Pembroke campus, was there a
separate faculty for Pembroke, or was it Brown –
LB: No, that’s –
Q: – the Brown faculty would come over and –
LB: They came up, rain, shine, or what.
RP: And we used to wait to see if anybody would cut.
LB: Yeah. Johnny Green had – our second semester of Latin in our freshman year, well, he was
jovial and cordial and all, but sometimes he didn’t come. And it would get to be time for him to
come, and we were supposed to wait 10 minutes.
Q: And then what happened?
LB: And the class (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) –
Q: You could have a free period?
LB: So – yes. When the 10 minutes would begin, and two minutes later he hadn’t come, we’d
run up to the corner of [Meeting?] and Brown to see if he was coming. (laughter)
Q: And if he wasn’t coming you got to have a free period?
LB: We left.

15

RP: Yeah, that’s right.
Q: Did you have any women professors?
LB: Miss King.
RP: Only for biology. [19:00]
LB: Biology.
RP: Biology and gym, that’s all.
LB: And Miss King taught the second-year Latin. But you had – well, now, that’s one thing I
wrote down, was all the requirements. We had required courses –
Q: Yeah, tell me about the requirement.
LB: We had to take – well, we had to have – to graduate, to get an A.B., you had to have two
years of dead language. You could be two years of Latin, two years of Greek, or one of each, and
I ended up with Greek in my junior year, first-year Greek, with Kendall K. Smith, who –
RP: Oh, yes.
LB: – oh, we all loved him. He was young and he was married and had children, but he was tall
and good-looking and friendly, and it was a very friendly class, because, well, I was a junior, and
the girls that sat behind me were sophomores. We took – I don't know if I can say this on that,
but I took first-year Greek because I didn’t want Miss King (inaudible) for Latin class. I didn’t
like her.
Q: What did you take, Miss Presel, what (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)?

16

RP: I always did advanced work in gym and French. [20:00]
Q: You just said you didn’t have to take a dead language?
RP: No, because I had my Ph.B. I didn’t take Latin.
LB: See, we had –
RP: I took Latin Civilization with Johnny Green, and one thing I remember about him – you
know, he was quite a gentlemanly fellow.
LB: Very much.
RP: Very formal manners and all that sort of thing. And he was talking about the civilization of
Roman times, and he apologized one morning for describing the sewage system in the Roman
cities. (laughter) It’s a fact.
LB: I can imagine, I can imagine. He liked some of the seniors, too.
RP: Yes.
LB: Senior girls. He liked Ivory Madison.
RP: Oh, as he should have, because she was such a pretty girl.
LB: She was a senior when we were, what, freshmen?
RP: Yes, she was darling. Yeah, she was pretty. By the way, he cut so much. You know,
sometimes the girls thought, “Well, here we are paying our money for tuition, and these
professors don’t give us all of the classes that we really are entitled to.” [21:00]

17

LB: Well, he was more so than any other.
RP: Yes.
LB: I can hardly remember any other professor cutting.
RP: No, so – he really did cut. What else do you have there?
LB: Well, I think Rose told you that I – we had no warm, personal connection between the
professor and the class. Well, the two I had with Johnny Green, and we were reading – well, I
can remember Cicero wrote “De Senectute,” but whether – I don’t think it was in the form of a
play, but Johnny Green used to get up and go to the door and come back, sort of acting out
something that we were reading. And then one year I had Professor Humpkins in French, and I
don't know what the rest of his name is. But he’d evidently spent a lot of time in France, and
with a name like Humpkins, I don't know if he had his mother – if he had any French in him or
not, but he was a French student, [22:00] anyway. And I guess that was second-year French, and
I’d already had three or four. But he went to France to fight – I don’t remember now whether it
was in the French army, but he really did – he went to France after a couple of years that we
were in college, to be in the army – whether it was ours or French, I don’t remember. But he was
fun. He used to write things on the blackboard, and he was very sociable. And he was young –
seemed young, and probably wasn’t even in –
RP: He didn’t have a beard. A couple of the others had beards.
Q: So that made him young. (laughter)
LB: Yeah, they [witnessed?], they did. Professor Allinson taught Greek – I didn’t have him, but
he had – you know, he was a bearded gentleman.
RP: Yeah, that’s right.

18

Q: Well, tell me what other courses you had to take.
LB: Oh, two years of dead language. We had one year of English themes. We had first – one –
first semester your first year [23:00] and first semester your second year, and the second – two
second semesters was English literature. And we did have a nice professor, Benedict.
RP: Oh, yes. (inaudible)
LB: Yes. And then we had a year – had to have a year of European history with Professor
Collier.
RP: Yes, and that really was a very good course. Everybody was crazy about Professor Collier.
LB: And I think – and I wrote down – maybe you remember, Rose – I wrote Charlemagne to
1815. Did it cover that period? I know it ended with the peace of Vienna.
RP: That was 1815, wasn’t it?
LB: Yes, but did it begin as far back as Charlemagne?
RP: It probably did.
LB: Well, it seemed to me that it could have been –
RP: European history, yes.
LB: – a tremendous period, but it stopped with 1815. And then we had to have a year of
philosophy, or something that was equal –
RP: Philosophy or psychology.

19

LB: Well, I took – I always kind of was more practical, [24:00] not abstract, so I took applied
psychology with Professor Dellabare.
RP: Yes, I had Dellabare too.
LB: Well, he’s one of these professors that almost talks to himself. But he had all kinds of graphs
and charts on the board with A and B and, you know, and I thought it quite interesting. And at
that time – oh, the psychologist up at Harvard had just written a book. [Oh, do you see his
name?] – Freud. I think he was – wasn’t he a professor at Harvard?
RP: (inaudible)
LB: Well, we had to buy a book that thick that he had written, and it was quite new, and he –
evidently he’s much younger. Well, he was an Austrian, but one of these psychiatrists who had
lots of new ideas, you know, nobody ever heard of them –
Q: So you studied Freud?
LB: Which?
Q: Freud. When you did psychology, you were working with Freud’s theories? [25:00]
LB: Floy’s?
Q: Freud.
RP: Freud.
LB: [Floy’s?] – no.
RP: Freud, of course, was the Austrian psychiatrist.
20

LB: Yes, but we didn’t – no, we didn’t do – he didn’t have us do any kind of experiments or
anything. Maybe we talked and – talked to him in class. I can’t remember. But you had to take a
year of philosophy or a year of psychology.
RP: I mean, you had to take a science.
LB: Yes, Biology I. We had – these were required. We had to take it.
RP: You had to have two years of a science, because I took a geology in my second year.
LB: Did you?
RP: Yes. Not that I ever remembered anything about it.
LB: No.
Q: Well, did you – Miss Presel, did you have to take different courses because your degree was a
slightly different degree, or –?
RP: No, the only difference in the Mast– in the –
LB: Ph.B.
RP: – Ph.B. and the A.B. was the classical.
LB: Yes.
RP: The classical language. That’s all. Otherwise we all took the same thing.
Q: What does Ph.B. mean?
21

RP: Bachelor of Philosophy. [26:00] I don't know where the philosophy came in there, but –
LB: Well, [Mars?] – that’s the degree that Mars had, and he took it so as not to have to take some
more mathematics. That’s another thing. We –
RP: We had to take math?
LB: Yes, our freshman year, we had – was it [play?] geometry?
RP: Oh, no, it was trigonometry and solid geometry.
LB: Solid – we had solid geometry.
RP: College algebra and all… I forgot what else. but –
Q: So you had a lot of requirements?
LB: Yes, two years of mathematics.
Q: And then after that you could take – you could elect to –
LB: Yes, you could finally have a few things that you wanted. Well, of course Rose didn't want
French and German. Well, I did mostly – I got down here – I thought I did. Well, I had more
languages than anything. French, German, Spanish.
RP: Well, I had Spanish too, but I took more German than French than anything.
LB: Well, I’d had three years of German in high school, and – no, four. [27:00] We started it our
first year, but we didn’t have French till our second year, but –

22

RP: Well, I had – I took the German when I first – I had German and French in my freshman
year. I had gotten the German prize, the entrance prize, you know, in German, but –
LB: Judy got it.
RP: Did she? Well, I got it when I – you don’t have that anymore, do you? Entrance
examinations for prizes?
Q: No, no.
RP: Well, there was one called the [Caesar Michman?] Prize.
Q: [Caesar Mich–?]
RP: – was a – quite a wealthy man, industrialist, in this city, and he had a prize for entrance and
examination– that got the highest mark for entering freshmen. And I got the prize –
Q: Including the men? Was it one test for the –?
RP: There were two prizes, but it was –
LB: First and second.
RP: – (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) – well, it was understood that the person at Pembroke
would have to do much better than the men on the campus. And I thought that that was really
discrimination. [28:00]
LB: Well, it was.
Q: Now, let me – now, wait a minute. You mean that if there were – so that two of the prizes
could go to men if a person on the Pembroke campus didn’t do much better?
23

RP: No, I don’t think that was it. You had first and second prize, and I don’t think there was a – I
don’t know who got the second prize when I was a freshman. Well, I got the first prize,
(laughter) anyway. And I think there was a French prize, too, and then – I think it was a Latin
prize.
LB: Yes, there was, because Judy, my daughter, took the German one, because she had
[Amelia?], and she had her German four years down pat.
RP: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)
LB: And Amelia was a Pembroker who was a senior when Rose and I were freshmen, and she
taught until she retired at Classical High School. And both my children had her and loved it, and
– so Judy took this German entrance thing that Rose was telling us about, and there were only
two of them, two girls, [29:00] no men there.
RP: No.
LB: And Judy’s – we had [Miss Mars?] to dinner shortly after Judy ended college, and Judy said,
“Well, now, how did –“ to Miss Mars – “how did they judge just two of us who would be the
prize winner?” Well, they had two prizes, and Judy said, “How could I get first prize?” And she
wasn’t sure if the other girl got even the second one, you know. She’s – Miss Mars said, “Well,
you wouldn’t have got it if you didn’t earn it.”
Q: Well, had you taken a lot of German in high school, or –?
RP: I took three years of German when I was in high school, with one of the first students who
entered Pembroke in – what was it, 1898 when it was first starting?
LB: Oh, no, ’92.

24

RP: [Ante Whedon?]. Do you remember the name? Ante Whedon?
LB: Oh, yes, I remember the name.
RP: Well, she was my German teacher at Hope.
LB: I think –
RP: I took three years of it.
LB: Well, I think Pembroke [30:00] was finally – I don't know what you call it; founded – I think
it’s 1892?
RP: ‘Ninety-one. ‘Ninety-one.
LB: Well, it’s –
Q: Well, I think this is interesting, that you went to Hope High School and you had a teacher
who went to Pembroke, and then after you left Pembroke you went to Hope High School. Is that
–?
RP: I was a head of the foreign language department at Hope High School for 20 years.
Q: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)
LB: She had – (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) other classmates there.
Q: Now, is that coincidence, or was there –? You know, there’s a lot of people that I have heard
about who graduated from Pembroke and then they became teachers, and a lot of them taught at
Hope High School.

25

LB: Yeah.
Q: And I was thinking, and I wanted to ask you, whether there was sort of a – maybe an informal
or even a formal connection between Pembroke and Hope High School, because there seem to be
a lot of people who had teachers who had graduated from Pembroke, and then they went and
taught at Hope High School –
RP: We had a training program.
LB: While you were in college.
RP: Well, we had a training program – for those people who took education [31:00] and wanted
to become teachers, they would apply at Brown, where a certain amount of money was given. I
think in the first place, they taught without money, but they were given their tuition for graduate
courses in education. That was it. And so a great many people who graduated from Pembroke or
Brown became student teachers at Hope High. And that lasted for one year, and then they hoped
that they would get a permanent position somewhere.
Q: So when you left Hope High School and then you went to Pembroke, did you keep up contact
with someone like Ante Whedon?
RP: Well, we were always friends, as far as I can remember.
Q: And was she there when you went to teach there? Was she still there?
RP: When I – oh, no. No, she had died. No, she’d died, I think, in 1917 if I remember.
Q: And when did you – you didn’t go there immediately, did you, after you graduated?
RP: No, I didn’t, because I was doing concert work with my sister, (overlapping dialogue;
inaudible) –
26

Q: That’s what I found – I saw that.
RP: And so I, I didn’t have the time. [32:00] I didn’t really intend to teach anyway. (laughter)
But we did it – do you remember that some of us went up to – went down to the superintendent’s
office in the school department after we graduated and – to put our names in, because –
LB: Because of course, I didn’t teach.
RP: – for – no, for substitute teaching.
LB: Mm-hmm.
RP: And hoping that we would get a permanent job sometime or other, you know. Well, I finally
did. But, no, I did concert work when I graduated from Pembroke, and my sister and I would
travel quite a bit. And then the Depression came, and of course, we – people were not going to
pay, you know, people for giving concerts if they could help it. They might pay your expenses,
but they wouldn’t give you any kind of a stipend, you know, a regular fee. So my old principal,
who was at Hope, called me up one day and asked if I would like to come and substitute for a
while at Hope High School because the teacher of German was getting married. [33:00]
Q: So you were living back in Providence at that time?
RP: Oh, yes, I was – well, I always lived in Providence.
Q: So when you graduated from Pembroke, you still lived in Providence, but you went all around
–
RP: I used to travel with my sister. Because we gave concerts for two pianos. And we used to –
we raised money by giving a concert for two pianos, up in the – what is now the library at
Pembroke Hall. For Alumnae Hall. Because we gave a concert, and had our two pianos up on the
27

stage in Pembroke Hall, and we gave a concert – I’ve forgotten how much they charge for
tickets, but we had some money, we raised some money, to build Alumnae Hall.
LB: Yeah, well, then, we had – we did all kinds of things.
RP: Yes, we had my – the concert at [Mayo?] Hall.
LB: We had one in her house.
Q: Now, what year was this?
LB: It would be –
RP: It was after that, wasn’t it? After we graduated.
LB: We were out.
RP: Yes.
LB: Yes, because this time, we were raising money for Andrews Hall.
RP: Was it Andrews? Yes, (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) –
LB: Because Alumnae opened... [34:00]
RP: I’ve forgotten what [day?].
LB: Well, that’s one thing that the students – women students now know nothing about: how
hard we worked as alumnae, raising money to get some more buildings on the Pembroke
campus. In our day, there was the gym that – Miller Hall had been built in 1910, and we arrived
in 1914. And Pembroke Hall – those were the three buildings. Then, while we were in college,
28

the college bought Cottage – it’s not there now – [Mechavis?] takes up some of it. And they had
that for – it held 18 girls; what do you call it?
RP: A cooperative (overlapping dialogue; inaudible).
LB: Yes, cooperative. They lived there and they did the cooking and all, and so they paid less
tuition than we did. And that was – I don't know how long that went on, [35:00] but it began
while we were there. And –
Q: And then you helped – after you graduated you helped raise money to build (overlapping
dialogue; inaudible)?
RP: Oh, yes.
LB: We did – oh, we did all kinds of things. The thing – after my – I had – after my children
were born – see, we had the Alumnae Association. And one thing they did, oh it was an all-day
affair – I wasn't on the committee; I had just come out of the hospital a little bit before that, but I
took my two children, and they were young, maybe five and seven. Well, it was just like a small
affair – not a circus, but they had what they called a ranch cart – this was all on the Pembroke
campus, where they had, like out West, frankfurts and, oh, all kinds of things, you know, and
some of them were wearing a cowboy hat that were working there. They had all kinds of things
that would amuse children, and we all took our children [36:00] and paid something – whatever
it was, I don’t remember – because this would have been ’39, the spring of ’39. So my children
were... Judy was eight and my son was not quite 12.
Q: Had you – did you – Mrs. Brown, did you work at all after –?
LB: Yes, I did.
Q: – you graduated?

29

LB: I –
Q: What did you do?
LB: Oh, no, this is friends of mine over there. I was telling about – [Victor Framert?] and I
roomed together after we got out of college.
RP: (inaudible)
LB: And – right down 73 Brown Street, where Walter Wilson’s lab is now, right across from
Laura Carr’s. And while we were very patriotic – you see, that was 1918, and, well, you couldn’t
breathe without knowing what was going on that summer in France. And I got a job at a big
jewelry firm in Providence, Asprey Barton, in the estimating department – well, that took
arithmetic, and I used my algebra [37:00] to do some things. And Beatrice got one in Green,
Hinkey, and Allen? It’s got a different name now – you know, it’s, Green, Hinkey and Allen
doing some kind of clerical work. And we worked that summer.
Q: And you weren’t married by then.
LB: No, I wasn’t married till ’23.
Q: So when – had – did Pembroke prepare you to do that? Did they suggest to you that you
should take a job, or what were they trying –?
LB: No, nobody suggested anything, as far as I know. But what Beatrice and I did, after we did
our – what we thought was war work daytime, which we got a pittance salary for – well, women
did anyway in those days, but everything was relevant – we went up to Miss Johnson and Miss
Wales, the beginning of this present Johnson and Wales College: they lived on Olney Street,
right opposite the old Reservoir.
RP: That’s right.
30

LB: And the houses are still along there, nice big [38:00] brick houses. But the high school,
Hope High School, was there. But that was one of the Providence reservoirs. Bea and I used to
go up there after dinner, and we took shorthand and typewriting.
RP: That’s right.
LB: Yes.
RP: That’s the way Johnson and Wales College started. It was a two-family house. [One
across?].
LB: And here are these two women – I don't know whether they were related or what, but
(laughter).
RP: I don’t remember. But that’s the way that started.
Q: I was just trying – I was wondering whether – now, you said you went out on concert tour
after you – was that what you intended to do all the way through Pembroke?
RP: Oh, yes.
LB: Oh, goodness, she’s a musician. You and your sister both.
RP: Well, I still (inaudible) play it.
Q: Oh, I know.
RP: I didn’t play (inaudible) I was in the Chopin Club for a couple of years –
LB: Sure, and she’s been president of it, and –
31

Q: Oh, I was just –
LB: She’s talented.
Q: I was just sort of wondering whether – what sorts of things, I don't know, maybe the
expectations were on Pembroke women, or –
LB: Well, you mentioned this, I –
Q: Yeah, I was curious about – you know, today, (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) for me –
LB: When we were going to college.
Q: When you were going to college. Because I know that, [39:00] for example, today, people in
my class, men and women –
LB: You want a glass of water?
Q: Oh, I’m OK, that’s OK. We were – we’re very much encouraged to, you know, either get a
job or go to graduate school, whereas I asked my mother –
LB: We were women, remember. We had chauvinists, male chauvinists.
Q: But did you have people – I mean, if I ask my mother, she says, well, everyone in her class
was expected or encouraged to be (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) –
LB: But your mother is my children’s generation.

32

Q: Well, that’s why I’m asking – in your generation, what was the expectation for a graduate,
let’s say, of Pembroke? Did many of them – was it a common thing for them to work, or was it a
common thing for them to (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) –
LB: Teach, mostly.
RP: Well, a great many became librarians –
LB: Yes.
RP: – or teachers, and of course, those who had boyfriends got married. And even – a couple of
them got married while they were in college.
LB: Yes, during the war. Yes, Ann Terry-White.
RP: Oh, but we weren’t encouraged to get married during the war.
LB: Oh, no, she had to get (overlapping dialogue; inaudible).
RP: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) days.
LB: She was married in March 1918, because her husband was going to France, [40:00] or had
been her fiancé. And she had Miss King to deal with.
Q: The dean didn’t like people to get married?
LB: No, well, it wasn’t common. It just wasn’t done.
RP: No, well, they didn’t want the – they didn’t allow students at Pembroke to get married while
they were in college. They had to have special permission, and that was what happened when the

33

war came on. And another thing which they absolutely refused to allow was smoking, and if you
were caught smoking you were expelled.
Q: Were either one of you smokers?
LB: No, not I.
RP: No, no. You didn’t smoke either, no.
LB: Well, there were a lot of things, restrictions, that we lived under.
RP: Well, certainly we had to go to chapel every day.
Q: So did you really go?
RP: We did, and there was a monitor –
LB: They took attendance.
RP: – a monitor who took attendance. And of course, sometimes, a friend who might be absent
was considered present if she was a friend of the monitor.
Q: (laughter) Did everybody get a turn to be monitor? [41:00] Is that how it works?
RP: No, I don’t think so.
LB: I never was monitor.
RP: I don't know how, I don't know who –

34

Q: Well, what would happen if you were absent and you were not really absent? I mean, what
sorts of discipline was handed out if you cut a class or if you didn’t go to chapel or something
like that?
LB: Oh, well, we had –
RP: We had 18 cuts, I think.
LB: – we had cuts that we –
RP: Eighteen cuts that we were allowed; after that –
LB: But only three for classes.
RP: Well, was that – was that it? I’ve forgotten.
LB: Awfully small – allowed three cuts a semester.
RP: Yes, yeah.
Q: And what if you took more? What happened? Would you have to go speak to the dean?
RP: Oh, yes. Well, of course, I – there were certain no-cut days when you couldn’t cut, no matter
what. And that was right after a vacation of sorts, you know, after Christmas vacation, at New
Year’s time or Easter time or – I’ve forgotten – before vacations. And if you had to cut, you had
to get your permission from the dean. And my sister and I were giving a concert on a no-cut day,
January 2nd, I think it was. And my manager [42:00] had already gotten a hall; I think we were
playing in Boston that year, at that time, and it was going to be a no-cut day. And I went into the
dean’s office and asked her whether I might be excused from a penalty if I cut that day, and she
refused to give it to me.

35

Q: What did you do?
RP: So I was given three weeks’ discipline, three weeks’ college discipline, which meant that I
couldn’t cut a class, I couldn’t cut chapel, and I couldn’t hold an office in the class. And –
LB: Now, you see how restricted we were, and how narrow-minded a dean could be. Well, I
would show some more of Miss King – my sophomore year my parents went out of town for
quite some time, so there was room in the dormitory, so I moved, I went to the dormitory. Well,
of course I had to go see the dean to find out if I could move into the dormitory; I’d been living
at home. Well, the first thing she said to me, and I’ll never forget it – [43:00] what was I, about
late 18 years old, or earlier – yes. She said, “Miss Beals, do you think you are fitted to live in the
dormitory?” Now, whether she thought I was a scamp or a wild hellion, which I was anything
but in those days – well, you know, it made me feel about this big. Well, I suppose I said, “Yes, I
see no reason why I can’t live in a dormitory,” and I moved in the beginning of the second
semester my sophomore year. Then I went all my senior year in the dormitories.
RP: And you had restrictions in the dormitory. Now, you have to tell Barbara the kind of thing
that you weren’t allowed to do. (laughter)
LB: Can you stay out half the night if you want to? On the – this is Miller Hall, the only
dormitory there was. In the hall, just after you’d come in, around the corner, there was a table
opposite the telephone. And there was a book on it the size of that, open to pages. And it was all
cut up and drawn up into squares, so they were – it was that kind of paper. We had to ask
permission to go out in the evening, either with a Brown man if we knew one, or like my beau,
if he was not a Brown man, he lived in Providence. You had to get permission to spend the
evening, go out to the evening, maybe the movies or the theater, or whatever we did.
Q: What if you wanted to go with another friend from the dormitory? You could do that?
LB: You mean two girls?

36

Q: Yeah.
LB: Oh, I guess you could, I don’t remember. But it probably depended on – well, you wouldn’t
be going to any place that you weren’t supposed to go, because we weren’t that kind of girls in
those days. I mean, we – I told Rose, we were brought up to mind our parents and respect their
judgment; sometimes it might not have been sensible. (laughter) [45:00] My parents were very
young when I was in college. But you also had to sign in when you’d be back, and you had to be
back at 10:30.
Q: We just start going out at 10:30. (laughter)
LB: Our lights went out in the dormitory at ten o’clock.
Q: So did they have to know who – did they have to be familiar with the boy that you were going
out with, or could you go out with –?
LB: I don’t think so, no.
Q: And then they would have to come call for you.
LB: Oh, yes, they came right to Miller Hall.
Q: And how did that work? They had to wait downst– they couldn’t come to your room?
RP: Oh, never.
LB: Oh, no. If we weren’t completely dressed or not ready quite to go, they sat down in the two
lounges, especially the one as you come in on the right, which was a little more formal. The
other one that had the piano in where we collected for dinner, or meals. And there’s another
thing that was formal, was meals. And I liked it, and well, we were used to it, anyway. [46:00]
We had round tables in the dining room that held – well, not more than six students, or maybe
37

only five, because at the head of the table was the head of the house, who was – Miss Danielsen?
Was she at Miller Hall?
RP: She was once.
LB: Yes, she was the biology teacher. And Miss Bates, who was the gym teacher, they had –
they were the head of those two tables. And maybe they asked seniors – I can’t remember about
the others. But it was really just like a family. And we had maids. (laughter) And that’s one thing
I don’t like about – I wouldn’t want to go to Brown now, it’s all cafeteria style. I don’t like that.
Q: Yeah. Did you – you lived at home, but did you eat on the campus with the other –?
LB: No, lunch.
RP: No, we – no, we – yes, we ate lunch together. (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)
LB: Yeah, in the lunchroom in Pembroke Hall, down in the basement.
RP: Yes.
Q: So you got to eat with people sometimes.
LB: Oh –
RP: Oh, yes, I did.
LB: – oh, yes, we had groups of us that would collect. [47:00]
RP: But I didn’t spend too much time on the Pembroke campus, I’m sorry to say, because I had
to go home and practice.

38

Q: Did you used to practice every day?
RP: Oh, yes, indeed I did.
LB: Goodness. She’s still practicing four hours a day.
RP: Oh, yes, I do, I practice, play every day.
LB: Yes, how could she keep her hands in order if you didn’t –?
RP: They’re all right. And I have – they’re – my fingers are in just as good condition as they
were years ago.
LB: Yeah, well, that’s wonderful.
RP: So I do practice every day.
Q: But they wouldn’t let you take gym, because of your –
RP: No, they wouldn’t.
LB: Well, that was for her own good.
RP: No, they were afraid I would wreck my fingers. I probably would have, I don't know.
LB: Yes.
Q: Had you been playing piano since you were little?
RP: Since I was five years old.

39

Q: Can I show you something that I found?
RP: Yes.
Q: OK.
LB: And I want to show her something too.
Q: I found this –
RP: Oh, dear, where in the world did you ever find that?
Q: It’s in the archives.
RP: Oh, yes, why, that was a Providence journal.
Q: That was from 1949.
RP: That’s right, because they – we have the original of this. But there we are, and our –
LB: Well, I (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) – [48:00]
RP: – that was the house on Prospect Street.
LB: Yes, I don’t even remember seeing it, Rose.
RP: Well, they were advertising – I think it was just before the days when the big –
LB: FM radio.

40

RP: – FM radios, you know, became – and they wanted to advertise something or other, and here
is this one that we had; I didn’t think much of that one. But that’s me sitting here, and that’s my
sister –
LB: Yeah, sure, that’s [Charlotte?] –
RP: – this, across the other piano, is – it’s cut off, but there are two pianos there together.
Q: So were you sort of – were you sort of famous in Providence?
RP: Yes, I was.
LB: Sure. She still is. You can talk to any musical person, like my daughter-in-law’s aunt, Helen
Appleby?.
RP: Oh, yes, that’s right.
LB: Yeah. She died last spring. Well, she was 85, I think.
Q: So you were really a local celebrity –
RP: Well, yes, we were – we played ever since we were –
LB: Well, at that time –
RP: I was nine years old – the first time that my sister and I gave a concert, I was nine, and – my
sister was nine [49:00] and I was ten and a half. And we gave a two-piano concert in [Treble?]
Hall, which is now the Hillel place – [Treble?] Hall. And I played the Mendelssohn concerto
with my teacher on the second piano. And we had a – and I’ve still got some of the tickets and
the program that we played. And of course, we – Churchill House used to be a very famous place
for us to give concerts, too, right in the city. It used to be – of course, now it’s used as a
41

classroom. But it – you know where Churchill House is, on Angell Street. Well, that used to be a
beautiful place to give concerts. My sister and I did that quite frequently. And, oh, we played in
the – at Brown University frequently, and, oh, I even read some German poetry when I – at the
Rockefeller Hall, at – you know, it was called Rockefeller Hall in those days.
LB: Brown Union.
RP: Yes, the Brown Union, at the Faunce House.
LB: They don’t call it that anymore.
RP: The Faunce House Theater. [50:00] Because we were celebrating the – what was it? The
hundredth or – hundredth anniversary, and I guess – no, I guess it was the 200th anniversary of
the German Friedrich Gothe, you know, the great writer. And I read some German poetry,
because we had what we called the Germanic American – Germanic Society. And Professor
Crowell was one of –
LB: Ooh, I’d forgotten about him.
RP: – the officers, and Professor Rand, and one other German professor, Professor Herrmann.
Now, Professor Herrmann I think is still living; he’s in his nineties, and he’s living out of – he’s
living in New Jersey with his daughter. But he – now, we talked about the impersonality of some
of the professors. Well, Professor Herrmann was one of the people who liked to be with students,
and he used to invite certain people to his home, and we used to – I used to play for them and we
used to sing some German songs, and he [51:00] and his wife used to prepare a little German
refreshment, you know, and coffee.
Q: This is when you were a student?

42

RP: No, this is when I was a graduate. When I took graduate courses, for my Master’s. I had my
Master’s from Brown too. And so he really was a very much more friendly professor than some
of the others that we had when I was in college, so –
LB: And my children’s generation, my son particularly, had a professor that he loved – he’s
dead, and I’ve been trying to think of his name while you were talking and I can’t, but he lives\d
around on the East Side. And he had students – they had sort of open house every Sunday
afternoon. Now, I – and I knew him quite well; of course he wasn’t there in my day, but Teddy
just loved him. And he went every Sunday afternoon to kind of a – well, we call it a tea; I don't
know what he had, but – and he took a girl from Pembroke who was a senior, and Ted was a
junior, I guess, and [52:00] she said, “My goodness, I wish I’d known about that long ago,” and
he was the nicest professor. And there were so many of them they’d sit on the floor and all the
chairs, and he went every Sunday. This would have been –
RP: That was at his home.
LB: Yes.
RP: Yes, well, now, at the present time –
LB: And that was about ’48 or ‘9 – ’48 and ‘9.
RP: Well, at Pembroke, because we really didn’t have very many places where we could
congregate with a group and a professor. But I –
LB: Still don’t.
RP: – but you do have it now, you know, at the different dormitories there, you have those
lounges where you have lectures and all kinds of things, and I think that’s wonderful.
LB: Yeah, but they’re on the men’s campus.
43

RP: Yes, they’re on the men’s campus, that’s right.
Q: And a lot of professors have students to their house.
RP: Yes, I know they do. But I don’t remember – I don't know whether Professor Collier? had
anybody or not. If he did, I never went.
Q: When you were at Pembroke, where did you used to –? I’m wondering if we should turn this
over. Maybe we should. Let’s see.
RP: We’re going to have –
End of Track 1 [pemb000009_1]
Start of Track 2 [pemb000009_2]
[heavy distortion on audio]
LB: – well, she had that [shot?], you know, [walking down the street?], and (inaudible) –
Q: You said you wanted to tell me about the dances that you had?
LB: Yeah, we had four a year. Or I don’t – [maybe we had any?] 1918; I don’t remember ’17,
but they were college dances held in the gym, and they were very formal. We wore evening
dresses. You brought Brown men or your own beau from – that you’d grown up with.
Q: Did you invite somebody or you had to wait for the man to invite you?
LB: Oh, no, you did the inviting. If you saw him you invited him; if he lived out – if he lived in
Providence and you didn’t see him because he wasn’t at Brown, you let him know.

44

Q: So you had a steady –
LB: I did, yes. And I – well, I didn’t marry him because he was killed in the first war. I was
engaged to him, and I had a ring. I got it my 21st birthday my senior year, when I was in the
dormitory, and oh, the girls were so – when I came back, I went out [01:00] and stayed with his
family, and we went to the theatre on my 21st birthday, March 16, 1918. And Mabel Brown, who
was a freshman, and a friend of Cooper’s?, Nick, who was already in the Navy, Newport, and my
beau and I – we’d grown up together – we went to the theatre. And I have no recollection of
what we saw. It was the Majestic Theatre down here. And I guess we’d been to dinner, but I, of
course, don’t know how long ago this is – 63 years – but he went off to war in May and he was
killed in the (autobahn?) in September. Well – oh, about the dances. They were very formal, and
the men wore white tie and tails.
Q: And what did you wear?
LB: Long evening dresses. Didn't we?
RP: Yeah, so we used to get them – I used to get them (inaudible) the dance.
Q: Did you have a steady beau also, or –?
RP: No, I didn’t have a steady beau. Either of us – No, I spread my affections.
LB: Yeah, well, [02:00] I asked a couple of Brown men sometimes, because my fiancé was in
Newport. And he was a pharmacist, and he couldn’t always come up to Providence, so I did take
– once I took this Ed Nickerson, a friend of his? who was dead too, but not in the war, and – I
guess I took a couple of Brown men, but – well, I don't know. We didn’t know Brown men too
well, although I did go to Phi Kappa Psi dances. Do they still have Phi Kappa Psi?
Q: They do.

45

LB: Well, [Irene McGaviney’s Bill Thatcher?], he lost that so (inaudible) he just stayed in
college for two years, but I went to several of those. But these college dances that were our own
dances, (inaudible) we did the inviting and there was seating and the dean, and there was, I think,
about four of them.
RP: Oh, yes.
LB: Miss Danielson –
Q: And you had to bring your – [03:00] so they had to check out who you were – who you were
–
LB: No.
RP: I don’t think so.
Q: No?
RP: Well, I mean, we had to bring our beaus up and they had to shake hands –
LB: Yeah, you went up [to the receiving?] –
RP: – where they were receiving (inaudible) –
LB: Yeah, you introduced them. You went through the receiving line, which I think – oh, wait a
minute, but outside of (inaudible) –
RP: Was Miss Bates there?
LB: Oh, I don't know, probably. In her Brown [groupers?]. (laughter)

46

Q: Did you – Miss Presel, did you go with Brown men, or did you have to go – you must have
known –
LB: Yeah, I guess they were more Brown men, as far as I can remember. Most of them are not
around anymore.
Q: Was there a lot of status attached to how many dates you would go on, things like that? Or it
wasn’t a big deal?
RP: No –
LB: No.
RP: – there were a lot of stories that were gossip, you know, that arose about girls going with
certain people, or – and I remember that once I was accused of dancing too much with one man
in one dance. [04:00]
LB: Oh, really? (laughter)
RP: Instead of spreading out my dances on my dance card.
Q: So what did that mean, if you were dancing too much –?
RP: Well, I don't know. That was – that was not told (inaudible), you know.
LB: Well, I remember, I don't know whether it was Jim and Marie – James [Finnick?] and Marie
Ettl – she was our class, a classmate of ours, and he was 18 at Brown. They had both died very
recently. And they met each other freshman year. She came up – she came from Leona, New
Jersey, and he lived out in North (inaudible). And I don't know whether she called – Miss King
called Marie over, but they were told that they were dancing too close. I’ll never forget it.

47

Q: How were you supposed to dance?
LB: Oh, we had, you know, regular ballroom dancing, but I don't know, they were in love
already in freshman, sophomore year, [05:00] because they did get married eventually. But I
don't know what was wrong, but that was just one of Miss King’s quirks, just like asking me if
she thought I was fitted to live in the dormitory. I don't know what she thought of me. I was
really the most reserved person when I was that age – I didn’t cut up any hijinks or –
Q: That was afterwards, right?
LB: Well, I don’t – maybe, but I had to be out a long time, (laughter) I was probably married
before I had – we had hijinks. But do you remember seeing Lauren?
RP: Yes.
LB: – in 1920, and she lived right across the hall from me in my senior year. And she used to go
out a lot with Buster Wilcox. He has died within the last few years. I think he’s our class at
Brown. And Miss [Paddock?], they came out – she was the house mother when we were [06:00]
seniors, at least seniors. And she had that room that’s at the far end of the formal lounge, that
was her room. Well, [Seal?], when Buster Wilcox – I guess they stepped into the hall to say
goodnight, and they talked a little bit, and then he kissed her and he left. He went to Brown.
Next – I don't know whether it was right after that or whether Miss Paddock waited till morning,
but she asked Seal about it. She said she didn’t like that kind of thing. Seal said, “Oh, we’re
engaged.” And a week later she told Miss Paddock she broke the engagement.
Q: So you weren’t even allowed to kiss your date goodnight.
LB: No. Oh, goodness.
RP: Everything was really quite reserved. And I even remember when that drugstore that was
down at the corner of Miner’s
48

LB: Meeting and –
RP: What was it called?
LB: Meeting and Thayer.
RP: Yes, [07:00] that’s right.
LB: Isn’t there a drugstore there now?
RP: Oh, I think there is now, but there used to be one –
LB: Well, it was [Reiner’s?], (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) –
RP: Right, it was called Reiner’s, and we used to go down there for ice cream or something.
LB: Yes.
RP: And we were told we had to put on our gloves and our hats just to go down to the drugstore.
LB: This was in the daytime.
RP: Yes.
LB: As well. When we lived in the dormitory, before ten o’clock –
RP: I remember Mary [Tent?] and I – she was a classmate now that –
LB: We just felt like getting out, and it was, like, late spring, nice warm weather, you know, so
we said, “Well, let’s go down to the drugstore and get an ice cream cone.” And when we came
49

out of Miller Hall and over across Pembroke campus to go down – we didn’t have the steps there
and all that fancy business –
RP: I don't know how we got out.
LB: – anyway, you know, there was East Building and –
RP: Oh, yes.
LB: – Howard Terrace, you know, and Alumnae Hall. That wasn’t there either.
RP: No, (overlapping dialogue; inaudible).
LB: Well, we came through from Miller Hall to get to Meeting Street. [08:00] And we looked up
at Pembroke Hall and the way through, and the lights were going on the second floor. And this
was probably half-past nine. And – of course, Mary was kind of crazy, and we said – and there
was a statue up there, I don't know what, but we could see its head, with the lights going up there
in the second floor hall. So I guess Mary thought this up – she’s Phi Beta Kappa. She’d think up
things and dare to do them. And when we were on the way back she said, “Let’s tell Helen
Douglas –“ she was the head of the student – head of Miller Hall, and so this had to be about
1916, and she’s 17, I think. Well, anyway, so when we got into Miller Hall with our ice cream
cones, licking away, Helen came down the stairs, and we said, “Oh, the lights are on in
Pembroke Hall, [09:00] and we saw a man’s head up there.” We didn’t say – we just said, “It’s a
man’s head.” Well, Miss King happened to be in Miss Paddock’s parlor.
RP: Yes.
LB: And I don't know when [they called anybody working at the Works Department?], but
anyway, we had to go with them over on to the Pembroke campus, our campus, for them to see
it. And of course a lot of the other people in Miller Hall came along too. Well, I suppose Miss

50

King, she was a classical scholar, and she looked up and took a second look and she said, “It’s
that statue up there.” We – (laughter) Mary and I got more fun out of creating all this excitement.
Q: I guess you missed all that – you weren’t in the dorms.
LB: No, she’d have been out with the rest of us, but –
RP: No, I suppose so.
LB: I think half the dormitory came out.
RP: No. I did miss something, because I didn’t live in the dormitory. [10:00]
LB: Well, it was very nice to really live at home some of the time and go back and forth, because
there used to be a lot of us that got out of our streetcars down behind the post office and walked
up Angell Street.
RP: Yes, we used to walk up Angell –
LB: Together.
Q: Did you miss not living in the dormitory?
RP: Well, not at that time.
LB: Well, you lived at home. I wouldn’t have lived in the dormitory if my parents hadn’t gone
off –
RP: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) so close, Prospect Street, all I had to do was walk down
the street.

51

LB: Well, my daughter and son, they both lived at home because we lived on Meeting Street.
And they just walked up the street and over to the campus. And Miss Morris said one time,
“Well, I think it would be ridiculous for you to – for the children, your children, to be in a
dormitory and pay that expense and –“
RP: But I think at the present time they require freshmen to live in the dormitory, don’t they?
Q: Yeah, they do. Well, you can live at home if you live close by. But it sounds like there were
maybe about 50, 51 people in your class. [11:00]
LB: Fifty-one graduated. Oh, I wrote that down. I’d think something like 80 or 84 entered in
1914 in our class. And it was the largest class that had ever entered. Now, 1917 was a very small
class.
Q: Well, what happened to the other –
LB: Well, attrition. A lot of people couldn’t take it, or they couldn’t do college work, and they
left at the end of first semester. Well, of course, that was a complete waste for professors, the
college, and all. So I don't know how long they did that for, because now there’s no such thing,
but maybe if their high school recommended them they’d come. And they didn’t all – they
weren’t all local, either.
RP: No, that’s true.
LB: And one person died, that Leona – that Italian girl, do you remember? She was killed in a
streetcar accident. [12:00] And then [Rudin Gether?], she was a great girl, she went to Trinity in
Washington, a Catholic college, and she became a nun. And she was in Boston for years and
years, she died two, three years ago. And Q: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) Sorry.

52

LB: That’s all right. Well, I don't know, from 80, say, to 51, that’s a lot of people leaving. But
there were 51 of us. And of course, it being 1918, and the war on, an awful lot of men had
already enlisted or been to officers’ training camp, and there were only 50 men who graduated,
and they all went off – right after. Jim Bennett stayed and graduated, but he went to Texas to
train in the Air Force. Of course, the war lasted only from May to – from that, he was out over in
November. But we had shortened everything. We didn’t have, like, a long Easter vacation. We
used to have a week, ten days at least; [13:00] all we had was – beginning Good Friday, we had
Good Friday, Saturday, Easter Sunday, and we had to be back at college on Monday. And I was
living in [Gonker?], I went home with Seal, and she lived over in Wilamantic. And – but – and
so we had graduation, commencement, early.
Q: Early.
LB: The 29th of May.
Q: Wow, that is early.
LB: And then from then on we got – after Easter weekend we had no spring vacation, no
nothing, and we got out – because it used to be the third Wednesday in June, and that’s only in
the last eight or 10 years, that commencement has been changed to the first Monday.
Q: Well, there was one – I don’t mean to cut you short. There was one last thing I did want to
make sure that we got on here.
LB: Well, yes.
Q: I guess you know – I might have explained that these tapes are going to go into the archives
for people to listen to, and so I thought it would be interesting to try to – I mean, listening to you
talk, [14:00] I can see that Pembroke was a really a special and important time for you, because I
talked to you both on the phone and here, and I guess I just wanted to get something for other

53

people to hear – for you to talk a little bit about what it meant for you in your life to have gone to
Pembroke.
LB: Well, I loved college while I was there. And because it was so small, we – you didn’t know
upperclassmen well, you know, they never know freshmen – we didn’t, at least, I didn’t when I
was a senior – but I think it certainly broadened your outlook and developed interest for the rest
of your life that if you had just stopped at the end of high school, unless you were an unusual
person, I don’t think you would have got interested and got – or do a lot of things that you do
now. And I probably wouldn’t read – [15:00] although as children we always read at home, but I
read a lot and I’m interested in a lot that I probably wouldn’t know anything about. And one of
my electives was art and architecture. Well, if I’d been a man, I think I would have become an
architect, but there weren’t such things, women architects, in those days. I’ve always loved
buildings and in the art course, the professor we had, Shapley? –
RP: Yes.
LB: Do you remember what he looked like? He was tall and skinny and he was really a little bit
bashful. But he took the whole class, as many as wanted to go – and I think this was my junior
year – to Boston. We all went up on the train to Boston. I can remember Carolyn [Capwell?], so
she would have been a sophomore, and, well, I forget who the others were. But this shows you
what our time was like. Mrs. Hastings, who was – Professor Hastings in the English department,
his wife – went with us [16:00] as a chaperone to go along with poor little old Professor Shapley
– we had to have a chaperone. So Mrs. Hastings went to Boston with us, and we went to the
Museum of Fine Arts, and we had our lunch there. And then we went out to Harvard, and we had
to do all of this up there on –
Q: Now, that’s why you needed the chaperone. (laughter)
LB: (laughter) Oh, we were going to Harvard. I don't know if we even saw a student, because of
– well, you know, I don't know how much more there is at Harvard now than museums, but the
one with – what’s the name of it?
54

Q: Fogg?
RP: The Fogg Museum.
LB: It had those beautiful – what are they, glass?
Q: Flowers.
LB: Flowers?
RP: Well, that was not in the Fogg. That’s the one in the – what is it called?
LB: The Wiley or something? I don't know. Well, we saw them. Well, we must have seen
buildings, because we were all so interested in architecture. Oh, I learned a lot about the old
cathedrals in Europe, you know. [17:00] And I know what a flying buttress is (laughter) and I
know what all kinds of things are that I learned in architecture. But I think, having Mrs. – Mrs.
Hastings having to go with maybe 15 girls, and Professor Shapley, who was perfectly harmless,
(laughter) –
RP: Well, I think that college did a lot for me. For one thing, it did give me a little bit of more
maturity.
LB: Well, it did me, Rose. I was quite young when I entered.
RP: Well, I graduated from high school when I was 15.
Q: Oh, wow.

55

RP: And they – I couldn’t get into Brown with that, they wouldn’t let me in at 15, so I went back
to Hope High and took some graduate courses, and then I went in when I was 16, and I was the
youngest one who graduated in my class –
LB: Yes.
RP: – at Brown, anyway.
LB: She’s 10 months younger than me.
Q: How old are you both?
LB: She was – you want to tell her?
RP: Well, yes.
LB: All she’s got to do is add 20 and 21 to the years that have passed.
RP: Twenty and twenty-one. [18:00] Yes, well, we’re both over 80, you know that.
LB: Sure. She was 83 in January, and I’m going to be 84 the 16th of next month. March. This
month, this March.
RP: Sixteenth of March….So we’ve come a long way, Barbara. And we appreciate Pembroke,
and we hope that the name doesn’t die.
LB: Well, I hope it doesn’t – in fact, not too long after the merger, it seems to me I remember
some discussion about changing Pembroke Hall to something else. And of course that was the
first lonely building. Everything went on at Pembroke in that hall, in that building. And I don't
know when they built the gym – it was pretty new when we came.

56

RP: Yes. Well, we’ve got lots of things that are quite different from Brown at the present time.
Q: I know, it seems that way.
RP: Well, it was a great –
LB: Well, the times were different, much more formality, even the way we were brought up.
[19:00] So there was – I don’t think the restrictions bothered us too much.
RP: No, I don’t think we knew any better.
LB: (laughter)
RP: That’s right.
Q: OK. Well –
