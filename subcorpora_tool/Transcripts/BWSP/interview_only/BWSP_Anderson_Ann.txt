Wendy Korwin: It’s Saturday, May 25, 2013. This is Wendy Korwin, the Pembroke Center
archivist and I’m speaking with Ann Chmielewski Anderson, class of 1959, in Pembroke Hall,
Brown University. I wanted to start by asking you to describe a little bit about your family and
childhood
Ann Chmielewski Anderson: Uh huh. Well, I am one of two children. I have a sister who is two
and a half years older than I, and then my mother, of course, went to Pembroke, and she was a
social worker. And Father was Banking Commissioner of the State. My mother always had a
career. I went to preschool I think when I was about three, and she went back to work part-time
1

and then when we were in full-time school, full-time, which was somewhat unusual I think back
then. But my mother and her sister had careers and they would have been very reluctant to give
them up, so my mother worked. And that, as I say, was different. My classmates’ mothers were
at home. But I was raised in a family where education was very important and women were on
par with men and we could do anything that we felt we wanted to. And I was always given that
vision, that it was simply a matter of you making up your mind what you wanted to do. I was
raised in a family where it was never question a question of whether you’d go to college or not. It
was a question which college you would go to. My sister chose to go to the University of Rhode
Island and I came here to Pembroke. I grew up in Providence until I was about twelve years old
and then we moved to Cranston and went to Cranston High and then of course came to
Pembroke.
I’m not sure … I was fairly familiar with Pembroke because my mother would come
back to her reunion every year, and reunion then was not like it is now. Right beside here, there’s
Sayles Hall, Pembroke Hall, and where the tent is now there were tables, and reunion consisted
of coming to tea. And so… and you were able… they brought families because it was all outside
and children could run around. I remember that we would come with my mother and her best
friend who used to come into town for these reunions and come up and have tea. So that was the
Pembroke reunion back then. So I was familiar with Pembroke and I think there was one other
college I considered when I was getting out of high school because my best friend was going to
Jackson at Tufts and so I did apply there but decided in the end on Pembroke. So that’s how I got
here.
WK: Do you recall what your earliest impressions were of Pembroke and Brown?
ACA: You mean as a child coming up here? Yes, I liked it. I thought there were a lot of pretty
buildings. And because we always had fun at the reunion. And my aunt lived off Hope Street so
it was a familiar sight to just drive down Waterman to Hope and see Brown and know it was
Brown and that kind of thing. So it’s hard to think about an impression because it was just
always part of my growing up because it was here.
WK: How did it feel when you came here as a student yourself?

2

ACA: I remember Freshman Week being very nervous. Cranston High was rather small and I
really knew an awful lot of people and was very comfortable and had a lot of fun there … so
coming here with so many people, you know all the women – girls, they considered them –
ourselves at that time – and there were very few that I knew, and I remember being very nervous.
And then Freshman Week was quite an experience. I don’t know if you’ve talked with anybody
who was here around the time. I was here and we had something – Freshman Week consisted of
many different events. Some social, but some just plain … we had to take tests to see where
you’d place in certain things or whether you’d place out of certain things. So we had exams, and
we had posture pictures. I don’t know if you’ve heard of posture pictures [laughs] but they were
quite dreadful, so that they had to have everything about us in the record I guess from the inside
out. And as well as taking the exams, there would be plays and things like that. So Freshman
Week was kind of a nerve-wracking experience, I remember that. But then I settled in and it was
a happy place. I enjoyed it.
WK: Did you live on campus?
ACA: Initially, no, for two reasons. One is my parents had two daughters in college at the same
time and so they felt I could live at home. But I think also as I think back, there wasn’t a choice
back then if you could live at home, you were asked because they didn’t have much dorm space.
So it was – they preferred that you lived at home if you could. And I had the added advantage of
having an aunt that lived close by, so I stayed there a fair amount. And then of course we had
West House. So that a lot of your social life, you know between classes and everything, you had
West House to go to and sit around and socialize and stuff like that. The first two years. And
then the second two years, I did live in Metcalf my junior year and Andrews my senior year. And
those were fun times too. I enjoyed living on campus. It was good.
WK: Did that shift the way you connected to your fellow students?
ACA: Well that’s interesting because I never felt particularly kind of separate. And I think that
we had these small classes called the I.C. classes where there were only about 20 people in class

3

and I took those so that I got to know the other women in those classes and they would live on
campus. And I believe there was also the possibility of – you could eat at Andrews even though
you didn’t live there if you were here late. I was a Chemistry major at that time, for the first two
years, and so had labs that lasted ‘til 5:00 and 6:00 in the evening and sometimes those days, I
would eat at Andrews and got to know people then. So I really felt like when I started to live in
the dorms, I knew a number of people already so I didn’t feel too separate from them. I do know
some of my friends from West House did not have that many friends outside of West House, so
that I think it was probably a function of me [laughs] that I tended to get to know people so that I
didn’t feel separate.
WK: What kinds of activities went on at West House? What did it offer the city girls?
ACA: Just the same as the dorm I think, pretty much. I do remember that I had labs an awful lot
of the time so I didn’t have the same kind of socialized experience they did but I can remember
coming back from classes in the afternoon and people would be playing bridge all afternoon. I
never learned bridge until after I got out of college [laughs] but yeah, it was pretty much like a
dorm. And we also had the Gate. The Gate was in – I’m trying to think – I think the Gate was in
the bottom of Alumnae Hall. It was, yes, I think it was in the bottom of Alumnae Hall. It was an
eating – a coffee shop-type place – but there were also and lots of tables and the people from
West House, the commuters, had lunch there so we socialized then. And also it was a place
where you could get coffee or cakes or that kind of thing, so people would go there in the
afternoon as well and socialize.
WK: Did the city girls and the dorm girls socialize in the same way with the men at Brown?
ACA: I believe they did. Now, yes. I’m trying to think… I was dating someone from high school
who also came to Brown, so I was dating him… and they had, I forget what the men’s house was
called for the people that commuted, but they had a house similar to West House. But I
remember the guys would come to the Gate and I believe there were a number of my friends
from West House that dated Brown people and married them, too. I didn’t meet my husband
until it was a month after I moved into the dorms, but it really had very little to do with moving

4

into the dorms; I met him through a guy I was dating from Brown that I met through other
women at West House. So I think there was a lot of interaction there.
WK: And what about interaction between students at Brown and the Providence community?
ACA: That … I don’t have any memory of that, at all. There were, I believe, some volunteer
type things, or parts of the different courses where students would go down and work with the
elementary school in Fox Point. And there were like Big Brother programs, Big Sister programs,
but as far as interacting with the city, I don’t remember that. I certainly was familiar with
downtown. In high school, I worked in one of the banks during the summer, so had a lot of
friends from my work experience, but I don’t remember that interaction. I think we pretty much
stayed around here. Thayer Street was kind of, it certainly isn’t what it is now, but it was kind
of…they had Toy Son’s restaurant. That was the restaurant. And a drugstore on the corner of
Waterman and Thayer, and a couple of clothing stores, a florist shop, things like that. But very
different from now. No Brown bookstore.
WK: Did the women of Pembroke have any particular reputation, either with the men of Brown
or the townies?
ACA: I don’t know about that. I know there used to be a saying that Brown men didn’t date
Pembrokers but they did marry them [laughs] so I don’t know what that meant. But certainly like
this reunion weekend we’re reuning with about five other couples, all of whom, the women were
Pembrokers and the men were Brown men, and they…. My husband lived in an apartment his
fifth year. He was here five here because of engineering. They were all here for five years
because of engineering and ROTC. So that fifth year, they lived in this apartment and we all
dated together. So all of these women were Pembrokers and the men were Brown [laughs]. So
they certainly dated them and married them. And, you know, there was so many rules back then.
We had curfews. I think you had to be in at 10:00 on the weeknights and you had to be, I think
Fridays through Sundays was midnight, and Saturdays 1:00. I think that was it. But you signed in
and you signed out. It got checked [laughs]. And of course you didn’t have men in your rooms,

5

so they had we would call open houses and that was probably one Sunday a month and those
Sundays you could have a man in your room with the door open.
WK: What would you do on the weekends on your dates?
ACA: I’m trying to think what we did. Sometimes we would go do free movies at Faunce House.
We frequently would have – we’d go to a party. If it was a football weekend, we’d go to the
football game and when my husband had the apartment, they would take turns making dinner for
us and we’d all go there to the apartment. Then of course there were different … like on Spring
Weekend there would be all kinds of parties…. Mostly, we would do things like that. Very calm
things. Other people might have done different things. I was just trying to think what Jack and I
did. But basically, if there was some kind of sports game we’d go because my husband really
likes sports, and probably to dinner. Sometimes we would walk down to Providence and we’d go
out to dinner at very inexpensive spaghetti houses and things like that. Yeah. But many times, I
guess, especially my senior year and his fifth year we would hang out at his apartment with the
other guys and dates…. But you know, as I said, there were rules, so we had to be home by a
certain time. And of course, it’s very different now and I can see from the number of restaurants
all over the place that people must not have a food plan or whatever or they can opt now. We did
go to Andrews for all our meals and Wednesdays – I think it was Wednesdays and Sundays – we
had dress dinner, and you couldn’t wear sneakers and things like socks. You had to put stockings
and skirts. I don’t think there was much slacks wearing back then, or jeans. It was mostly skirts.
WK: Were there other traditions that you remember?
ACA: Well, of course chapel. And that was, I’m trying to think…. It seems to me it must have
been Tuesdays and Fridays, but I’m not sure about the days. But we did have chapel, and it
lasted I believe maybe a half-hour, max. And senior year we wore our robes to chapel. And that
was certainly a tradition. And the dress dinner. And the curfews. And it was very nice to have. I
know that they did change the name, changed the whole organization in ‘72, was it? But it was
very nice to have a college of our own. You know, to have our own bookstore and our own
newspaper and our own yearbook and just, our own campus, really, even though there were

6

mixed classes and men did come up to Alumnae Hall because it was a big venue for lectures and
stuff like that. But it was very nice I think to have our own college.
WK: And as somebody who studied the sciences, were there many other women in your classes?
ACA: Uh, no. Not until I got into psychology. I was in Chemistry initially, for two years. And I
don’t remember there being a whole lot of women in them at all. Mostly, I had men for lab
partners and things like that. I remember more men than women. So yeah, I don’t think – when I
got into Psych, which I changed to my junior year, there were many more women of course.
- End of Track 1 Track 2
ACA: I was just trying to think about other differences…. Well, in fact, I think that… we had our
own dances and we had the Christmas Dance and things like that, which is really how I got
together with my husband. I had met him on a double date for Homecoming in October and
really thought he was rather nice but he didn’t call me. I was with somebody else [laughs] and so
I really was, you know, back in, this was ’57, you didn’t ask someone – a woman didn’t ask a
man for a date, and she certainly didn’t pass out her phone number, not that I had one. The
Christmas Dance was coming up, so I called him and asked him to go to the Christmas Dance,
and much to my surprise he said yes, and the rest as they say is history [laughs]. And I’m not
sure, you know, if we hadn’t had our own dances, I wouldn’t have been able to do that.
WK: So at the Pembroke dances, Pembrokers would ask their dates.
ACA: Yes. And most times people asked somebody they were dating but I took the big plunge.
And of course, life in the dorm was very different than it is now. You know, everybody has a cell
phone now. Even when my kids went to college there were phone collections so you brought
your own phone and connected it up. In Metcalf there were two telephone booths in a hallway
and after dinner you lined up if you wanted to make a phone call with your pocket of change.
And Andrews I think had four telephones on each side, East Andrews and West Andrews. But

7

many more people so there was always a line for the phone. And of course moving in and
moving out was rather simple because you had a radio, a typewriter, and a lamp, [laughs] and
that was about it. Although they did – a lot of people wanted to leave their clothes here because
you know it was so hard, taking a trunk back and forth, so they did institute some pine boxes one
year, or they had them for a number of years, and people could store stuff over the summer. But
not the way you need stuff now, like microwave ovens and things like that.
WK: And how would you keep in touch with your family while you were on campus for school?
ACA: Oh, just when I could give them a call. That was about it, really. You know, a lot of
people wrote home, but I of course didn’t need to do that. And a lot of times because I lived
close by and my aunt did as well I would take friends from the dorm home for dinner on Sunday
or something like that. I’d take them to my aunt’s some evenings for dinner. That was just kind
of nice. They enjoyed it, that kind of thing. But, life was very different [laughs]. Some of it, the
changes, I’m sure are wonderful, and some, well, all change involves some loss, so…. But you
know, we had – I don’t know if they still – of course they didn’t, if they blended into a co-ed
university – like, we had a May Day, and maypole dance, and I can remember being involved in
that, doing different skits and things like that. I don’t imagine they have stuff like that anymore.
So I wonder about – I don’t imagine that the women get into as cohesive groups as we certainly
did. I don’t know what effect that would have on it.
WK: How did you feel when you learned of the merger of the women’s college and the men’s
college?
ACA: I think that at the time, I thought it was inevitable, and after all, we did have all our classes
together and in that sense it made sense and I guess I didn’t focus on what Pembroke was giving
up. I, only now, I guess I’ve talked to more people, some of them who went to women’s
colleges, I see that really in some ways we had the best of both worlds….
WK: You know, I did want to ask you about this newspaper clipping [from the Providence
Sunday Journal, May 25, 1958]

8

ACA: Oh sure [laughs]
WK: It’s from your junior year?
ACA: It was the end of my junior year. It was a man, a neighbor in town, in Cranston,
approached me. I think he was having trouble getting volunteers, although once I got into the
contest there were loads of people. But anyway, he asked if I would be willing to be a contestant.
WK: This was for Miss Cranston?
ACA: Yeah. And I said sure. I said, as long as it’s after exams, because I really can’t do much
before then. And he said, “oh, yeah, it shouldn’t be a problem.” So I think it wasn’t too involved.
We had some luncheons and things like that and so I kind of did it as a favor to him on kind of a
lark. And my family of course came, and Jack came, to the contest. And my sister said, “well,
Ann, I know the only reason you came in fourth was because when they asked three wishes you
were the only one that didn’t wish to be Miss Cranston.” [laughs] And I gave a couple of other
answers that were kind of off the norm [laughs] which was why this reporter I think approached
me at the end, because I think he thought I was a little different. Anyway, that’s why I entered
the contest.
Why this came out was because there was a reporter there covering the contest and he
approached me after the contest and asked me would I be willing to be interviewed. And I said
sure. And in the process of interviewing I was telling him what was most on my mind, which –
the next day was Jack’s birthday and I had to make a pie for him. So he said, “well, can I come
over and take pictures?” I said “sure,” so the next – that was Friday evening – Saturday, he came
around 4:00 or 5:00 he came over and of course my father offered him cocktails and it was that
time of the evening. And so he took our picture and we opened the paper on Sunday [laughs],
was absolutely appalled. I was working at the Psych department at the time – or, yeah – because
that summer I worked as an assistant to one of the professors in the Psych department. So I came
in on Monday and they had this up on the bulletin board. So anyway, it’s not someone –
something – I tell people at this point, especially my more liberated friends, but there it is.

9

WK: Well, the article does mention your answer to the question of who did you most admire.
ACA: Yes. And that was actually Professor Clayton – Dr. Clayton – was the reason I switched to
psychology. She just was wonderful. She made things come alive. And I had taken a Psych I.C.
my sophomore year and she taught it. And I thought she was just wonderful. And, I don’t think
she was my advisor, although she may have been. But I did really, really liked Psych I.C. and
then became a Psych major and took a lot more, mostly psychosis.
WK: What drew you academically and professionally to the field of psychology?
ACA: Well, my mother was a social worker, so we were kind of raised on Freud. So I think that
probably that, and then reading all the different original works which is what you did in the I.C.
courses and discussing them really excited me to know more about the whole broad subject of
psychology, like from Pavlov and then Jung and Freud, all of whom are quite different but on the
subject of psychology, I thought it was fascinating. I did – one of, I think junior year – had to do
an original experiment and I had rats that I was running on a maze and that kind of thing. So I
liked all aspects of it. And in fact, I took a lot of sciences courses because at that time if you
were going onto a Ph.D. in Psych, you had to have all these other courses… biology, anatomy…
and of course I had the chemistry so that was done … and statistics…. So I had a lot of math and
science to do with the Psych because at Brown it was experimental psych and when I then went
onto a school of social work it was much more analytic psych. But what intrigued me was the
whole idea of behavior and how much behavior is patterned and how much comes from within
the unconscious and that kind of thing, so comparing it all was very interesting.
WK: What sorts of encouragement or guidance or discouragement did you receive for going on
in your education?
ACA: From home?
WK: From home, or at Brown?

10

ACA: Oh, well in Psych they really encouraged you to go on because they felt this was just the
beginning and I certainly had that reinforced at home. So to go on to graduate school from
college was kind of expected by the time got to my senior year. It was a matter of what kind of
graduate school, and I ended up choosing social work. I think because – I’m trying to think –
because I certainly had the basis for going on to my Ph.D. but I think I decided that I would go
for social work possibly because by that time I was thinking about marriage and therefore would
need to work, because Jack would be going on to graduate school. That was already decided. So
I think that might have been it. I felt comfortable going on to school of social work. But I’m not
sure when I exactly made that decision because I did take German, a reading knowledge of
German because at that time for a Ph.D. you had to have a reading knowledge of two languages,
and I had the French. So I took something which was called “Reading German,” and it as
specifically for going onto graduate school, and that’s what you learned to do: read it. Very little
else. Your final exam was they gave you a newspaper article, and translate. So having chosen
those courses, I’m thinking back, well I couldn’t have really been convinced that this social work
was the way to go. But in the end that’s what I did do, and I was very happy.
WK: Can you describe what path your career took after the social work degree?
ACA: Well, it’s very interesting because I don’t think I considered it a real career until after the
children were in school and I went back to work. I worked, both in Boston when Jack was
getting his M.B.A. and then we moved to Rochester, and I worked there at a child guidance
clinic for a number of years until we had children. And then I stayed home with the children, so
that must have been from ’67 until I probably went back to work in ’76. But in the meantime, I
had done some independent studies, research studies, for child welfare in Rochester, Monroe
County. While Kirsten was little but I could do it on my own so that I was able to find
babysitters. When I went back after the children were in school I went to work at Strong
Memorial Hospital and again I was working part-time, but then they asked me to head up the
inpatient Social Work program and Psychiatry and then pretty soon, could I head up inpatient
and outpatient. There wasn’t too much left – I was heading Social Work and Psychiatry and
because it was a university, then the head of Social Work said, “you know, if you really want to

11

stay here, you really ought to get your Ph.D. because it’s an academic setting and your Masters
isn’t going to do it.”
So I went back to Syracuse to get my Ph.D. and when I did, it was really quite exciting to
be back learning again, and I commuted one day a week to Syracuse and took one of my required
courses and general electives. And I did that for years. But the day away from the hospital gave
me a perspective on what I was learning and what I was kind of getting confined into at the
hospital, which was completely away from clinical work and doing therapy with people. So by
the time I was ready to do my dissertation I had decided I needed to leave and go into private
practice. And that’s what I did. So I would say the idea of a career gradually began to evolve as I
worked at Strong. Prior to that, I was a social worker and it was a job [laughs]. But once the
children were in school and I was now thinking about, “okay, what do I want to do?’ then it
became more of a career.
WK: What drew you to private practice, specifically?
ACA: I wanted to do more clinical work, which is really what I loved, and do therapy with
people and the higher I got in social work, the less clinical work I was doing. I was supervising –
I liked the supervision; I supervised both social workers and residents, and I enjoyed that – but I
also knew I could continue to do that and private practice. The part that I liked best at Strong I
could transfer over, so that’s what I did. And that, too, was a gradual evolution, as it were. You
know, you were always allowed to have a small private practice while you were working at the
hospital. So it was when I got an office and was doing it half-time then, I gave up Strong,
continued with my Ph.D., and had the private practice …. When I left Strong, people thought I
was leaving for private practice so my private practice grew. So by the time I finished my Ph.D. I
had a full-time private practice, and I did that for many, many years, and very happily. It was
something I loved and I probably would have done it, you know, much longer, except that we
had decided we would retire when Jack was 65 and when we retired we would move, and so I
didn’t want to go through the process of being licensed in Colorado and go through all that. And
also, living in Colorado with part of our family still here, I knew I’d want to be taking off and
visiting. I retired too. It probably was a little early.

12

AK: Were there, in your private practice, were there specific populations or issues that came to
be specialties?
ACA: Well, I saw many many women who had gotten very far in their various careers, been very
successful, but found a number of things. One is that in their education and in their upbringing
they’d never been really taught – would be the word? I’m not sure “taught” is the word – but
they’d never found it comfortable to direct people. They were very successful in their careers in
terms of thinking and being creative and everything, but as far as being competitive, yeah,
competitive, or being able to manage people and feel comfortable managing people…. That was
kind of new to them, and they weren’t totally comfortable with that. So I saw a number of
women where we worked on those issues, recognizing who they’d really become, in essence,
because it wasn’t something that they set out to be. In some ways like myself [laughs]. So I saw
many women. I saw a number of – I had quite a varied practice, but mostly adults. I saw couples.
I saw some families. And I saw a few teenagers, but I didn’t see children. I’d seen children at the
child guidance clinic, but I didn’t have a playroom and that kind of thing so it was best to stick
with people who could communicate by talking [laughs]. But I saw Vietnam vets with
posttraumatic stress, and gay and lesbian people who were having difficulties either with
relationships or just again feeling comfortable with themselves. It was a very interesting group of
people and I really, really enjoyed working with them. They were very high functioning for the
most part. I had very few people I had to hospitalize, and it was very rewarding work, very
rewarding work.
WK: And can you describe a little bit of what must have been a very busy home life, with two
children while you were doing your Ph.D. and your practice. How did you split responsibilities
with your husband?
ACA: Well, he was not raised in a home where men had a whole lot of home responsibilities…
but he just was great. You know, he didn’t do things the way I would have done them [laughs].
But things got done and the children survived and all those kind of good things. But I once asked
my son, “What do you remember about when I used to go to Syracuse?” He said, “We ate at
Ponderosa.” The kids were fine about it. I did try to leave time on Saturdays. I would try to do

13

my studying in the evening or on Sundays. But Saturdays I tried to leave with them so that we
could do things together, and they were, you know, not babies when I was doing this. I think
Kirsten… if I started in…. Kirsten was probably 11, and Brian 13, so they were, you know…
And we lived in the city, so they didn’t need me to take them places. They got their own bikes,
and we lived in a neighborhood so a lot of their friends were right in the neighborhood so they
could do things with their friends by themselves. But it was busy. But put one foot in front of the
other and get through it.
WK: And Brian eventually came to Brown himself, right?
ACA: Right. I was always very active. I interviewed – they had the National Alumni Schools
program, I don’t know if they have that now, but they did then, so from -- the kids were little
when I started that – so probably early ‘70s, so for about 20 years I interviewed students
applying to Brown in Rochester and then would send the write-ups here and I couldn’t do them
all because we really had an awful lot of applicants, but I had a number of people I would assign
them to. And then after a while I was joined by another brown alum, John Whitmire, and we
shared the responsibility together. And we would, in the fall, have a reception, kind of, for them
to come, and usually there was a representative from Brown, and we’d have the slideshow and
answer questions and you know, refreshments and all. And then the ones that were accepted,
we’d had some kind of party for them to get together, a send-off party and something like that. I
did that for about as I said 20 years.… And between that and my mother, and his father, he was
used to hearing about Brown. And he started at Syracuse because Brian was not a very good
student in high school. He didn’t like to go to high school [laughs]. So he didn’t get into Brown.
But he went to Syracuse and then did very well, because that was much more his speed, going to
class for an hour and being able to have a break. But he did very well in college so his midsecond year came to Brown.
WK: What are some of the biggest ways you’ve seen the institution change over the years
working with the students, and coming back, and having your son enter?

14

ACA: Well when he came here, it was very different from what we had when we were here.
Interestingly enough, I think he was in the same dorm as my husband, so the buildings hadn’t
changed as such. But the campus has changed, I mean, I had to try to figure out where Pembroke
Hall was, you know. I did, because I recognized Sayles Gym and Meeting Street and all. So the
biggest change in terms of physical change was the incredible buildings and, it’s just huge now
compared to when we were there. Academically, I mean, certainly when we were here, we had
required courses and certainly when Brian was here there were no required courses. You could
design your own program. Of course, he felt that he should be like his father so took mostly
History, Political Science, and Economics, and when he got through, he decided this was not
something he could do [laughs]. So he went back to the drawing board and went to medical
school. So in a way, I think it’s nice to be able to design your own program but he might have
figured it out earlier had he not – you know, he loves those things: political science and history;
not sure he’s wild about economics – but anyway, but I think if he’d had to take other courses
maybe he’d have figured it out earlier. But it all turned out beautifully, and he has a wonderful
varied background and he’s still very interested in history. But he’s actually much more like his
mother. He’s a psychiatrist now [laughs].
WK: And what does your life look like now?
ACA: What do I do? I understand it’s called reinventing yourself, from what I read. Now, I hike,
I climb fourteeners – they’re mountains in Colorado that are over 14,000 feet. There are 56 of
them. I’ve done 22. I weave. I quilt. I babysit. I’m active at church. And we travel a lot and do a
lot of entertaining even up in Colorado. We enjoy being with people and that kind of thing, so
that’s my life. But it is lovely, waking up in the morning and saying, “well, what do I feel like
doing today?” Although my husband doesn’t hike. He likes things a little more competitive, so
he still plays softball.
WK: And you’re obviously still connected to Brown.
ACA: Oh yes. As I said, we come back every five years for Jack’s [reunion]. That, we do the
whole weekend because we’re here with all the people we were here with. The Pembroke one, I

always go to the luncheon, but I don’t always go to all the other things, because I didn’t really –
as a couple, we didn’t spend a whole lot of time with my classmates. They were mostly Jack’s.
So I enjoy the luncheons, I enjoy talking with everybody, and as I say, because we were all on
one campus, we were a very cohesive group. You were always at least familiar with somebody.
There were very few “strangers” in the class and a few people I was very close to. So it’s fun
coming back so I come back every five years. And then of course I love being back in
Providence because it’s my home.
WK: How have you seen Providence change over the years?
ACA: Oh wow. It’s… Well the buildings are the same, but of course they serve different
functions. Like Rhode Island Hospital trust where I worked summers is now part of RISD. And
just walking the streets.
WK: And the community of Providence? The, sort of, the feel of the city?
ACA: Well it’s certainly nice to see a city lively, you know, because Rochester, you know, the
downtown has just died. They need somebody like a Buddy Cianci I guess. [laughs] [cough]
Anyway.
WK: We’ve covered a lot of the bases that I had, so I just wanted to put it out to you now, to ask
if there were important things, or anything, that you were hoping to get down in this interview
about your time in Pembroke, or beyond.
ACA: Just that really, it was a special time. It was just lovely. And I’m sure that students have a
great time at Brown now, women as well as men, but I do think there was something very special
about having our college and our own campus, and it was very very very nice time, even though,
as I said, we only had two telephones in Metcalf hall, and they were pay at that. But you knew
the deans. I think there was a connectedness – and I’m not sure, I’m not that familiar with Brown
at the present time, so it may still be there in a different form – but it was very nice to be able to
talk with the dean and that was it. They were accessible.

WK: This was Dean Lewis?
ACA: Um, no, not Dean Lewis so much. I mean, she was there, but it was more Gretchen Tonks,
and Alberta Brown… and I think it was Alberta Brown that interviewed me for Pembroke. So it
just felt… it was Dean of Admissions talking to you, not an admissions officer, whatever, I
mean, there was an – I don’t know – and, as I say, this is all what people know now, so it’s not
like it’s any loss to them. It just felt awfully good to have that connectedness that I feel isn’t’
there. And have our own newspaper and yearbook and you know, all that kind of thing. I think
that things are in some ways easier now. I mean… well, even with my Ph.D., you had Xerox
machines which you didn’t have back then. Something was on reserve, you managed to get
yourself down to the John Hay and sit there for three hours because that was all you got was
three hours to do whatever it was you had to do. And now, of course, I’m sure everything’s
online that you need. And if it’s not online there’s a Xerox machine.
WK: It’s connected in a different way.
ACA: [Laughs] Right. And the library here in Pembroke Hall was really nice and quiet. And you
also socialized there I remember, because you sat at tables with other people. It was cozy and
nice. I think that’s what I remember. Mm hmm.
WK: Thanks so much for sharing, it’s really been a pleasure.
ACA: Good. I’m glad. It, well, it was such a wonderful thing to hear my mother that I thought I
should do that too, for someone else.
WK: Well thank you so much for adding to our collection.
