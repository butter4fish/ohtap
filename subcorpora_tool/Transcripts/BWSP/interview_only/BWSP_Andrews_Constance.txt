Karen Schneider: [00:00] – and I’ll start. My name’s Karen Schneider and I’m here interviewing
Constance Hurley Andrews, the class of 1948, Pembroke College. And I guess we’ll start out
with some family background. So, where were you born?
Constance Hurley Andrews: Providence.
KS: Providence. Right here.
CHA: So I’m a native, native of Providence.
KS: Provi– (laughter) And what did your parents do?
CHA: My father was a lawyer. He graduated from Brown in 1907. He was a Rhodes Scholar so
he had three years at Oxford after that – after Harvard Law. Then he came back to Providence
and began a law practice. And in 1917, he and my mother were married and went to Denmark for
the duration of what turned out to be WWI. And went to work for our State Department [01:00]
– or, Consulate Service, at that time – and then, after that was over, he turned to Providence and
went on with his law practice, and I was born here.
KS: And your mother?

1

CHA: My mother was born in Brooklyn, New York, but came to Providence to boarding school,
at a convent school that no longer exists, known as Elmhurst. That was how she met my father.
KS: And so you lived where in Providence?
CHA: On the East Side.
KS: On the East Side. So you didn’t have that far of a commute.
CHA: No, no. Twenty-minute walk.
KS: And where did you go to high school?
CHA: I went to what was then Mary C. Wheeler School, now the Wheeler School on Hope
Street. It was then a girls’ school, mixed day and board, but I was in [day group?]. [02:00]
KS: When was that? All the way through?
CHA: No, I was only there for three years. Before that I went to Henry Barnard School, which
was the laboratory school for Rhode Island College of Education.
KS: So education was an important thing in your family?
CHA: Always. Yes, very.
KS: So there was no doubt that you’d go off to college?
CHA: Oh, it was just assumed. (laughter)
KS: You grew up with your parents always?

2

CHA: Yes.
KS: Did you have any brothers or sisters?
CHA: I had a brother who graduated in 1941 from Brown, and that was all.
KS: [Is Brown in?] your family?
CHA: Yes, oh, Brown very much. My father was the president of his class from the time he
graduated until he died. (laughter) The Brown commencements were... events. They still are. But
Mother would keep us out of school so that we could go watch the procession. (laughter)
KS: That’s nice. (laughter)
CHA: It was. And lots of other family members that graduated.
KS: Did you apply to any other schools, or was it just...?
CHA: I did, but it was simply just to see that I could get in. It wasn’t [03:00] a question of... I
knew from [the beginning?] I was accepted. After an interview with the dean and my father, after
my junior year, I took my SATs... I had been accepted, with the assumption that I would not fall
flat on my face (laughter).
KS: And you just graduated from high school in June, and then you came to Pembroke in,
probably, September?
CHA: I can’t remember for the sure whether the semester started in September or not. It might
have been October, because – not that it’s important – at that time we were on a trimester system
because of the war. And the navy, you remember, that was here at Brown, was on a regular
trimester system, so the terms would begin with their schedule.

3

KS: What year did you start at Pembroke?
CHA: ’44. The [04:00] fall of ’44, graduated in ’48.
KS: So the war affected – was it just two semesters before the war, and they went to a trimester
because of the war?
CHA: Yes. I’m not sure when it went to trimester, maybe in 1942. But people could accelerate or
not, as they wished, and some of my classmates did go through three semesters a year. I didn’t. I
was... (inaudible)
KS: So, you were a City Girl?
CHA: Yes.
KS: So you lived at home in the winter, and you just commuted. How much time did you spend
on campus during the day?
CHA: Oh, the whole day. I would go home for dinner at night, and after – I think even my
freshman year, I was likely to come back to the campus after dinner [05:00] and study at the
library.
KS: And what were the dress codes back then?
CHA: I don’t remember a dress code.
KS: You had to wear skirts and –?
CHA: I don’t know that we had to. I did, because I thought it was becoming to me. (laughter)
But I think in the summer – and I didn’t go in the summer semester, but I think people could
wear shorts on the campus in the summer. But certainly we were beyond the hat and glove era,
4

which I have heard of. Evidently there was a period when a period when a female had to wear
hat and gloves to go on the Brown campus. It wouldn’t have been mandated for the Pembroke
Campus.
KS: So you were beyond that. You didn’t have to wear hats and gloves. Were you friends with
other City Girls, or were you – both?
CHA: Yeah, both, but more with other City Girls.
KS: So did you spend any time in the dorms? [06:00]
CHA: Some, but not really very much. There was a lounge for City Girls, which I didn’t spend
too much time in, either. I spent most of my time at the John Hay Library, which was then the
college library. There was a smoking room, and that was the place to be. (laughter) It seems so
different.
KS: Now, if you lit a cigarette in that building... (laughter)
CHA: I know! In fact, I have a friend who claims that the reason he started to smoke was so that
he could be in the smoking room (laughter) with the rest of us.
KS: How many classes did you take a semester?
CHA: Four.
KS: What was your major?
CHA: Political Science.
KS: Political Science. I read through a book that talked about the post war-era Pembroke campus
– was there a new curriculum change?
5

CHA: Oh, that was much [07:00] later. The new curriculum came in about 1970. I have a
nephew who graduated in the class of ’71 who was very much involved in the new curriculum
and the merger.
KS: Okay. Because they talk about something –
CHA: That’s very different. There was another –
KS: – 1946 curriculum, something... spanning more departments...
CHA: Yeah, and something called Distribution Courses. But that was just after. I don’t mean that
it was necessarily after 1948, but it was after I would have been required to do it.
KS: Okay. Did you just take Political Science, or were you experiencing other departments, too?
CHA: Oh, no. I think we took something like 30 – same number of courses – 32 courses.
KS: What were some courses that stand out in your mind as being exceptional or interesting?
CHA: For me, the Political Science courses did. And I didn’t really fall into [08:00] Political
Science until the end of my sophomore year. I had thought I would either be an English or a
History major. And I took a course with Guy Howard Dodge. It was marvelous, as far as I’m
concerned. (laughter) And that was just it.
KS: Was that a course in the Pembroke School, or did you have integrated courses?
CHA: I had integrated classes. I don’t remember having any non-integrated classes. I felt I went
to Brown, not just Pembroke. And once the veterans began to come back, there were far more
men in the classes.

6

KS: Did you feel shy to raise your hand to raise your hand or speak up in class because of it, or
did you feel totally comfortable?
CHA: No, it never occurred to me. In fact, for people have asked –
KS: Because they talk about that now.
CHA: Yeah. I don’t know where they were coming from. (laughter) No, I don’t know, [09:00]
because I had gone to a girls’ high school. But it just didn’t cross my mind. I would never get
inhibited in that way at all.
KS: Did you receive good counseling about your choices for taking classes? Did people help you
out?
CHA: The reason I hesitate is because I think I received almost none. A little bit... What I
received was good. There just wasn’t very much of it. At the end of my freshman year, my father
was very ill, and a lot of things were going wrong in my life. And somebody did become aware
of that, and I did get an interview with the dean, [10:00] I think, and a doctor, so that – I wasn’t
as far adrift as I thought I was. But as far as academic counseling, unless I sought it out, no. And,
interestingly enough, last night I was talking with my daughter, who was class of ’78, and – just
by coincidence – and she mentioned the fact that she felt that she had no career counseling – that
she wished she had. She felt that the university had a responsibility – whether they did or
whether they didn’t – but she felt that the university had a responsibility to at least make students
aware that it would be (inaudible) graduate school. Now on the other hand, while I say I had no
counseling, there was a professor in the Political Science department who I remember distinctly
asking me if I expected [11:00] to go to graduate school –
KS: And did you?
CHA: – and urged me – No. At that time, no. I knew that I was going to be married about a year
after college, and graduate school was just going to be too complicated.
7

KS: Did you meet your husband at Brown?
CHA: Yes.
KS: What year did you meet him?
CHA: In my sophomore year. He was a returned veteran. It was a very interesting time at Brown,
because there was so – well, I guess for anybody, but particularly for immature women – because
there was so many people, mostly men – but there were some women – but mostly men, who had
just so many awful, but so many interesting experiences, that it really enriched classes. And
sometimes the professors, particularly in Modern History and Political Science, would defer to
[12:00] the veterans as to what conditions were like in Europe at the time, and so forth.
KS: Wow. That would be amazing.
CHA: Yes, it was!
KS: Were you here during VE Day and VJ Day?
CHA: VE Day, yes.
KS: And what was the reaction on campus to...?
CHA: VJ Day was in the summer, and I was not here. But friends of mine were.
KS: How did students react to all that was happening?
CHA: Not so much, VE Day. I know people in Europe went wild. But we didn’t here because –
well, particularly, I think, because there was a Navy yard here, and they knew they weren’t
through. It wasn’t the end of the war. But [13:00] then when VJ Day came in August, it was the
8

middle of the summer semester, and... That was continued at Brown – at least through that
semester, and the semester after that... But there was a lot of euphoria that night, and I think the
students marched through the tunnel, and that kind of...
KS: So they supported the bombings?
CHA: We didn’t have any – we weren’t asked. The bombings came as a complete surprise. The
citizenry did not have any clue that that sort of thing was coming. It was just, “Ha!” (slap) There
wasn’t anti– that I recall – any antiwar protest, at that time. And I don’t remember…at home –
My [14:00] brother was in England in the Army, and my family was – my father was a liberal,
very much a supporter of Roosevelt and of the war effort, so it was just…nothing along that line.
KS: Did you participate in extracurricular activities on campus?
CHA: Yeah, some. As a freshman, I was involved in Sock and Buskin and WBRU. And WBRU
continued into my sophomore year, at that... After that, not really. I was much more involved in
my own social life.
KS: Than studies (laughter)?
CHA: Yes, those two [15:00].
KS: Did you participate in the traditions of Pembroke, May Day and Ivy Day and Sophomore
Masque?
CHA: I don’t remember a Sophomore Masque at all. And I’m not absolutely sure they had it. I
was aware of May Day. And the Ivy Day, I remember that dance distinctly. Because that was
sort of our senior dance. And I do remember the going to the junior prom, my own. And then, I
think probably, the next year, when I was a senior, to the other two. And they were formal da–
They were fun!

9

KS: (laughter) Did you go with your husband?

CHA: Yeah. We weren’t married then. But, yes. I went to a lot of fraternity dances.
KS: Did you? Was fraternity a big part of life [16:00] on...?
CHA: Oh, yeah.
KS: How many fraternities did they have?
CHA: About 15, I think. Yeah. There were no sororities. But my father and brother had been
members of a – of a fraternity, and my husband – was a different one. He was too. And at that
time, they had their own houses. They weren’t in the qua– The quadrangle hadn’t been built.
And they owned and were responsible for their own houses, some of which became sort of
(inaudible). But there were two or three fraternity houses on College Hill itself, and George
Street and Waterman Street – 80 Waterman Street. It’s a fine brick house. It’s university offices
now. But it was, at the time. And the fraternity... It was such a lively campus. The Brown
campus, at least, revolved around the fraternities.
KS: [17:00] Who was the president then?
CHA: Wriston.
KS: Wriston – which is actually the quads where all the fraternities are – was named after him.
CHA: Yes. He came in in ’37, when my brother as a freshman. He was a good speaker.
KS: Did you see him speak quite a bit?
CHA: Uh....
10

KS: Did you attend a lot of eve– convocation talks and...?
CHA: No. (laughter) No. I did hear him speak, from time to time. He spoke, sometime
commencement weekend. But I was aware of – on campus. He was a distinguished looking man.
When he walked across campus, you’d notice. Yeah.
KS: Were there any interesting people that came to the campus, while you were here?
CHA: Yes. Norman Thomas, who was a socialist, ran for president, [18:00] time and time and
time again.
KS: (laughter)
CHA: Henry Wallace spoke, in that period. And I heard them both. Offhand, I don’t remember
any others but... Oh, there must have been!
KS: What were relations between the male and female students like, socially, in the classroom?
It was totally integrated, besides the dorm life?
CHA: My memory, yes. Yeah. I think some of the Pembroke students were somewhat jealous of
the Wheaton girls…You know.
KS: (laughter)
CHA: I don’t know how they got on the campus. But, anyway. (laughter)
KS: [19:00] And was there a definite – like the Pembroke and the Brown or was it just...?
CHA: No. I can remember, every morning, midmorning, having the morning break in the Blue
Room, and again in the afternoon, of a group of... An amorphous group of us would be, late in
11

the afternoon, in the Blue Room. And it would be mixed, men and women, some faculty, and
undergraduates. Very minor contact with faculty. I don’t remember any distinct demarcation.
KS: OK. So then you graduated in 1948?
CHA: Mm-hmm.
KS: And you graduated with [20:00] political science degree?
CHA: Yeah, I did, poli sci.
KS: Yeah. And what’d you do after that?
CHA: I took a training course in librarianship, at the Providence Public Library, in the fall. And
it was a six months’ course, and which, we were paid a pittance – and had classes in the morning
and worked in the afternoon – with the expectation, at the end of the course, that, if you had
performed adequately – that we would be placed within the Providence Public Library system,
which was what happened. And I really was not career oriented, at all. I knew I didn’t want to
teach.
KS: Did your father or your mother have any goals for you? Did they want you to go on further
with your education or did they have a specific career that [21:00] they would have liked you to
pursue?
CHA: My father would have liked it if I would teach. And I had no interest in teaching. Had
there been a law school around at the time, I think I would have gone to law school. But there
wasn’t. And knowing that I was going to be married, when my husband finished – or my then
fiancé finished his master’s degree –
KS: At Brown?

12

CHA: – at Brown – which he did a year after I graduated....
KS: And what was his major?
CHA: Political Science – and so was his master’s. He graduated in ’47 and then got his master’s
degree. But knowing that, I wasn’t interested in even thinking about going on to graduate school.
And my father – attitude at that time was that the – seems so archaic (laughter) – that there were
[22:00] no good opportunities for a woman in law then, that I would be bored to death, doing
title research and that sort of thing.
KS: (laughter)
CHA: Well, that certainly isn’t the picture today. But, anyway. I never considered it seriously.
And really, the reason for my going to college was a typical liberal arts reason, was so that I
would be well-educated and able to interest and entertain myself in life. It wasn’t a vocational...
KS: If you had the same opportunities as females have today, do you think you would have gone
on to law school or...?
CHA: I don’t know if it would have been law school but I think I would have – yes. I don’t think
I would have done what I did. [23:00] Although I enjoyed reference librarianship, which was
mostly what I did. I was a librarian. But it’s dismally paid. The requirements for entry into the
profession are higher than for teaching, at least teaching in Rhode Island, and the pay is less.
But... I wouldn’t say dismal. But it’s not what they considered a (inaudible) [for that?]
(inaudible) – unless you go into special librarianship. That’s probably (inaudible), [at the time?],
computer search.
KS: What did your husband do, as a....?
CHA: He’s a librarian.

13

KS: Is he a librarian?
CHA: Yes. He was librarian for the Providence Journal. Well, he started off at Brown, [doing?]
social science. Then he was librarian for the Providence Journal. And then he stayed a librarian,
for 25 years.
KS: [24:00] Mm. And so you got married in 1950?
CHA: Forty-nine –a year, to the day, from graduation.
KS: (laughter) And you settled in Rhode Island?
CHA: Yes. But during the Korean War, he was called– He was in an intelligence unit – reserve
unit – and he was called back into the Army. So we had a year in Washington – and then a year
in Heidelberg, which was great.
KS: Yeah. Wow!
CHA: Yeah.
KS: Did you have kids then or were you st–?
CHA: No.
KS: So it was...
CHA: No, we didn’t. And we could travel. And Heidelberg was a wonderful base to travel from.
Because you could – you could get to most places in Europe in (inaudible) hours’ drive.
KS: So what did you see (laughter)?

14

CHA: Well, we went to Holland several times. Because he had a family there that had given
shelter after the Battle of the Bulge. [25:00] In fact, I’m still in contact with them. And we went
to France and Switzerland and England and Ireland–
KS: Wow!
CHA: – and in a year.
KS: That’s not bad.
CHA: I know! Because you could to it on a long weekend, and have time to absorb the
experiences before you were rushing around to the next new set of images.
KS: Did you learn any German?
CHA: Enough to shop. Unfortunately, I did not learn more than that. But I [learned?]. [I
learned?].
KS: He worked most of the week. So what did you do?
CHA: I read. And I did some traveling on my own. We had a car. So that I could drive –
sometimes with other Army wives and sometimes not. We had some contact with Germans but
not too much. And also, we had friends who were not in the Army but who were [26:00] in the
CIA, in Frankfurt. And they could not associate with other nationals. But they could – they could
associate with American civilians – but not with foreign nationals. So we were a breath of fresh
air for them. And Frankfurt was sort of as to Heidelberg as Boston is to Providence. So we did
some traveling, with them, in the – in the Black Forest and Strasbourg.
KS: Mm! It’s beautiful.
CHA: Yes. Have you been?
15

KS: Yeah. My mom took me –
CHA: Oh.
KS: – after I graduated from high school –
CHA: Oh, wonder– Oh, perfect.
KS: – which was my coming of age trip (laughter).
CHA: Yes! Yes.
KS: And we went to Germany. We went down the Rhine. We went to Strasbourg and Munich.
And we went to Holland.
CHA: Mm. Oh, wonderful. Mm.
KS: Just loved it.
CHA: Yeah. That’s a perfect thing to do. My [27:00] mother didn’t go to college but she spent
six weeks in Europe when she just about that age. Back then – back then, we had (inaudible)
time.
KS: Really! You’ve gone back.
CHA: Yeah.
KS: Have taken your kids?

16

CHA: No. I’m sorry to say, no. But my husband and I began to travel again when our youngest
child was a senior in college. So. (laughter) “We’ve done it!”
KS: Everybody’s through. Time to have fun.
CHA: Yeah. And I’ve kept as much as we possibly could, since. Some of it has been with Brown
groups. And some of it has been [with other?]... If we could handle the language comfortably
enough, we went on our own. But if we felt, such as Eastern Europe – before the war, though –
that we really couldn’t manage on our own, [28:00] then we went with the Brown group – and
went to Yugoslavia and other places in Eastern Europe – (inaudible).
KS: Sounds wonderful.
CHA: Just like last fall, some friends of mine and I rented a house on the south coast of Ireland,
for a couple of weeks. It was great (laughter).
KS: I can’t wait to retire!
CHA: Oh...
KS: It’s so far away!
CHA: Yes, yes, yes.
KS: But just to have the opportunities –
CHA: Yeah! Yeah.
KS: – and be wonderful. So after Heidelberg, you came and –
CHA: And back to Rhode Island.
17

KS: – and came back to Providence.
CHA: Yeah.
KS: And your husband...
CHA: He we–
KS: You started having children?
CHA: Yes. That’s...
KS: How many children do you have?
CHA: Just two, a boy and a girl.
KS: And they both went to Brown?
CHA: No. My son did not. He spent a lot of time finding himself –
KS: (laughter)
CHA: – and eventually did get a degree, at URI. And he’s a nurse. My daughter went [29:00] to
Brown. She’s the younger of the two.
KS: And what did she major in?
CHA: Semiotics –
KS: And now she’s...
18

CHA: – was an English degree. She’s in risk management insurance (laughter).
KS: And do you have any grandkids?
CHA: Yeah, four.
KS: And have any of them gone through?
CHA: No.
KS: S–
CHA: The oldest is seven.
KS: OK. So definitely they haven’t.
CHA: No.
KS: Do they have their sights on Brown? (laughter)
CHA: I don’t think they have – their sights on anything.
KS: No.
CHA: The next soccer game.
KS: Yeah. So when did you start working? Did you work when your children were small or...?
CHA: I started working when I graduated from college. When Elliot went back into the Army, I
stopped – [in Camp Bauer?] – and didn’t work seriously again – although I did have a couple
19

jobs in the library at Brown – I didn’t work seriously again [30:00] until my daughter, the
younger child, was in first grade. And then I was recruited to go back to the Providence Public
Library, by the then librarian who later was in charge of special libraries at Brown, I think, Stuart
Sherman. Anyway, they were going to try retreads. So I was an experimental retread, as a
married woman with children, going back half-time. And I had... It was just a great job. I worked
half-time, if the children went to school. So if they were sick or on vacation or it was
summertime, I didn’t work. And I worked from 9:00 to 1:00. And it was perfect. Then when the
children were a little [31:00] older and all I needed was to have somebody in the house when
they came home from school, the library persuaded me to come back full-time. And I did – but
not until they were 10, 12. And then I worked full-time, until I retired.
KS: Yeah. Did a lot of your classmates work while they were married and had children or did
they stay home?
CHA: Most of them worked until they had children. And they didn’t go back. I was really
unusual among my friends, in that I – that I worked. Some of them went back, a lot later, mostly
to teaching – and stayed with it until they retired. They didn’t go back when their kids were little.
[32:00]
KS: Were you still involved in the Brown – I don’t know – alumna –
CHA: Mm. Yes.
KS: – when you were...?
CHA: Yeah.
KS: What did you come back for?
CHA: When I was a young alumna.

20

KS: (laughter) Did you...?
CHA: We would...
KS: What activities were you involved in?
CHA: Well, the Pembroke Club of Providence had a junior group. We’re all seniors now! But
they ran an annual bridge. And there would be meetings about once a month. And the Pops
Concert, which is part of Commencement... You want some background?
KS: Yeah.
CHA: You haven’t been to a Brown concert.
KS: No. This year I’m coming back –
CHA: Do!.
KS: – to do some interviews.
CHA: Do. The Pops started, actually, on the Pembroke campus. It outgrew the Pembroke
campus.
KS: Really?
CHA: Yeah. Mm. But it did start, I don’t know, [33:00] probably in the early days. And the
Pembroke Club of Providence sponsored the initial... I don’t think it was our idea. But I think we
sponsored the initial.
KS: Concert?

21

CHA: Concert. And probably both the Pembroke Club and the Brown Club of Rhode Island.
And they still do sponsor.
KS: Do you come back for Commencement a lot?
CHA: Yes.
KS: All the Reunions and everything (laughter).
CHA: Yeah. Yeah. I enjoy Commencement. It’s a wonde– it’s a wonderful fest.
KS: (laughter)
CHA: And I come back whether it’s Reunion year or not. But my class, each year, either by itself
or with the neighboring classes, will have an off-year lunch.
KS: That’s a good idea, with the neighboring classes. Because, I mean, really, you just aren’t
friends with the people that in your grade –
CHA: Right!
KS: – I mean, have friends that span all [34:00] years.
CHA: Mm. Yeah. That’s good.
KS: And it’s a good idea.
CHA: Yeah. And there used to be a different system for Reunions for the Pembrokers – which
wasn’t true for Brown. Brown always met on the five-year system. And it was quite complicated.
But you would come back with the class ahead of you and the class behind you. And sometimes
you’d come back with the four years, sometimes it’d be six, sometimes it would be on the five22

year plan. But you were here in sort of a cluster. And that was debated. But I don’t know why or
when they decided to vote that out. It changed long before the merger. But...
KS: How do you feel about the merger?
CHA: Unlike most of my classmates – or many of my classmates, I think it was a good idea. I
like it.
KS: A lot of your classmates were against it? What were their reasons?
CHA: Were and are. [35:00] They felt that the women were losing their identity and that they
had had the best of both worlds, that they had had the opportunity for leadership, more
opportunity for leadership than they would have just mixed in with men. Because they weren’t
protected.
KS: Did you graduate with a Pembroke and a Brown diploma or just the Pembroke? Did you just
graduate with a Pembroke diploma?
CHA: Eh-eh eh-eh.
KS: (laughter) Sorry!
CHA: It is not a Pembroke diploma.
KS: It’s a....
CHA: It’s a Brown degree.
KS: OK. I didn’t know if there was – there was...
CHA: The was the Men’s College and Pembroke – both at Brown.
23

KS: You had – or s–
CHA: And it was [about experiences?]... Yes.
KS: OK. Because I think I’ve heard of other colleges where they have like the women’s college
degree, [36:00] the men’s, and...
CHA: Mm...
KS: No (laughter).
CHA: No. It was a university degree – but from Pembroke College (laughter).
KS: Yeah. What kind of obstacles have you encountered or encouragement have you received, I
guess, in pursuing your career? I mean, your husband was supportive of you going back to work
half-time?
CHA: Mm – and of going to graduate school. And I did.
KS: When did you go to graduate school?
CHA: I went to library school in the late ’60s, early ’70s. He got a library degree sometime in the
late ’60s. And as soon as he was through, then I started. We didn’t go together. But, anyway. He
was older than I was. So he went first. We both needed to. Once there was a library school in
Rhode Island, you know, that was accredited. But [37:00] it just made sense with me. But he was
always supportive of – no question at all, and helpful. It wasn’t just, “Go ahead, dear (laughter).”
He was helpful, in terms of taking care of kids and making sure that things got done around the
house. That’s...
KS: Amazing!
CHA: Yes.
KS: How has your Brown degree worked – how has it helped you? Or have you – I don’t know –
found other...? I guess, in your career path or just knowing...
CHA: I’m sure it simplified my career. And I know it simplified my entering graduate school.
And I didn’t have to pay for the graduate school boards or what– I’ve forgotten what they are.
But there’s some [38:00] big graduate school test that is – that is required. I didn’t have to take it.

They just looked at the Brown degree... And I did have people who were well known in the
community that were giving me references. And they were mostly Brown people.
KS: Is there a nice network of Brown people?
CHA: Yes. I think there’s less than there used to be. Because now there are people that will be...
And there are fewer people who remain in Providence than formerly. As the university has
grown and become more international, that’s a consequence.
KS: How have you seen it change, over the years?
CHA: Oh, from being a small, almost parochial – but from being a small, mainly undergraduate
college to being nationally known and then internationally [39:00] known. It’s changed vastly.
KS: How about degree of student? How would you say...? I mean, I know it’s kind of hard to
compare students now.
CHA: Well, I had the opportunity, when I was still working, to work with a number of women
who were in a women’s study program, that had to use the materials at the Providence Public
Library, because they needed to get into popular culture that had not been collected by Brown in
the women’s studies. So I had the opportunity to observe them. And they were such marvelous
self-starters. It was a delight to work with them, really. And I’m not sure, when I was at school,
that the undergraduates were quite such self-starters. [40:00] They knew what they wanted to do.
And they were doing it well.
KS: (laughter)
CHA: Yeah. That was...
KS: When did you retire?
CHA: In 1989. I took a year – early – early retirement. And I would have retired about three
years before that, except for Social Security. And, I don’t know, my pension would have been
severely diminished. But the reason I would have retired earlier was– not because I was
commuting. By then, we were living in South County. I had a commute of about 45 minutes to
an hour, each way. But I would have retired earlier, because the building that I worked in was
being renovated. And at the same time, the staff was [41:00] being reorganized. And it was just
awful. The renovation was terrible and the reorganization of staff was very difficult. I’m very
sympathetic with people who are being downsized (laughter). But anyway, I survived.
KS: And what have you done after you retired?
CHA: I’ve dabbled. And I’ve done nothing in the library field – except I belong to a couple of
book review groups, which I enjoy very much. But I’ve done volunteer work.
KS: What kind of volunteer work?
25

CHA: Just church work, some church women’s stuff…nothing serious. And I’ve traveled as
much as possible. And my husband was very sick about then, and not too well for a couple of
years before that – so that there were [42:00] family demands. Now both my children and all my
grandchildren live in the area. So I spend as much of the time as possible with them. And
perhaps [that’s the only activity] that is very serious.
KS: That’s what retirements are for (laughter), is to dabble and have fun and travel, enjoy
everything. With those Brown programs that you go travel with... I know my parents both went
to [Brown?]. And they get like the alumni news –
CHA: Oh, yeah.
KS: – and the trips. And they have the little programs where they teach you things along the way.
CHA: Oh, yeah!
KS: Is that what...?
CHA: Oh, Brown does that.
KS: Yeah. Is that what you were on?
CHA: Mm!
KS: Classes?
CHA: Yeah. So that you’d have... The Brown Club or Rhode Island sponsors some trips. And the
Brown Travelers sponsor trips. They’re different groups. The Brown Club of Rhode Island [are?]
[43:00] relatively inexpensive. But in both cases, there’s faculty along on the trip and there’s a
academic enrichment – which is really very helpful.
KS: So what kind of things...?
CHA: I’ve been to Elderhostel trips too, which, they do the same thing. And those are good
trips–
KS: So what have you learned (laughter)?
CHA: Hm. You learn about the culture, the place where you are! And you don’t learn too much
in just a couple of weeks.
KS: Yeah. It’s...
CHA: But it’s painless.

26

KS: Yeah. Which is nice.
CHA: Yeah.
KS: Learning should be painless.
CHA: Yes.
KS: I’m for that.
CHA: It helps.
KS: After just doing midterms, I’m all for learning that’s painless!
CHA: Yes. But you learn more than just your way around the menu, to... But you do learn that
[44:00] – how to work the exchange –
KS: (laughter) That’s a big...
CHA: – and that kind... Well, calculators help.
KS: Yeah. You have a calculator?
CHA: Yes. Mm. [Took me?] – in Italy – too far beyond the decimal point.
KS: I don’t know. Is there anything you’d like to add, about your experience, fond stories you
remember?
CHA: Not really. I’m very boring – little bit.
KS: Would you think it had been a very different experience if you had been away from home
and you’d lived on the campus?
CHA: Yes. And it was expected, that as an upperclassman, I would. But my father had a stroke.
And just was not [feasible?]. [45:00] So I think that it... And it would have been good for me.
But I think dorm life is a real growth experience.
KS: Yeah, (laughter) definitely is!
CHA: But that was the... But I had a good, active social life, perhaps just centered around the
library and people that I met there, all of us...
KS: What’d you do for fun, besides the fraternity parties?
CHA: Football games. Later, parties... That was later. [There was nothing?] –

27

KS: It was...
CHA: – at that time –
KS: Did you go off campus?
CHA: – because of the [rough?]... Yeah, some. We went to downtown Providence some –
movies [46:00], theater. We ate, when we’d go off campus, cheap meals in spaghetti places and
things like that. And in the spring, we were likely to go down to a local beach and swim. Picnics
at Lincoln Woods, some at – all around. We had some parties at the Brown Reservation.
[There?] was (inaudible) reservation. [And we’d go?] (inaudible). It’s developed now. That was
pretty much it. We didn’t go out too much during the week – or maybe coffee after studying –
but not too much – some theaters [47:00], like the Buskin, at that time. And there were a lot of
married couples at Brown, living at what was called Browntown. [47:16]
Track 2
CHA: [00:00] We played... I remember going there. Because some of them were fraternity
brothers of my husband. And we played bridge a lot there. I didn’t get into the trap of playing
bridge on campus during the day (laughter). But some of my friends did! But most of the time, in
the daytime, I’d study, at the Hay. But the same group that was studying there would go to the
Blue Room or something like that for a break, as I mentioned before. But most of the people that
I was with were really either seniors or graduate students, because of my then fiancé. Because
when I was a sophomore, he came back as a senior to finish off, because he’d been an
undergraduate before, so that his [01:00] friends were older. And it was stimulating,
intellectually stimulating to have the more advanced students. But that was – that was the way –
during the week. And then, the weekends, likely to be a fraternity party. And then home with the
family on Sunday.
KS: Put that in there (laughter).

28

CHA: Yeah. Yes. But, no, I’m very glad I went to Brown. I feel I got a good education – really
did – just a lack of or certainly a minimum of discrimination, that I experienced at school – I
doubt if any.
KS: Well, thank you, very much.
CHA: You’re welcome. Thank you!
KS: I enjoyed talking with you.
CHA: Thank you. Enjoyed talking... Well, I did the talking (laughter). [01:55]
