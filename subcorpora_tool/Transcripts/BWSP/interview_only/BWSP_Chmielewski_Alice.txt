No,

we didn't have sororities.

KL: I sa~ some comments about that, negative comments about
it in the yearbook.
Was there feelings that you should have
been allowed to have sororities?
AC: Yes, I think there was.
There was, because the men had
the fraternities and we didn't have sororities, we were not
allowed te.
I don't know why.
They didn't have sororities and
I think that peo~le felt t~at that was kind of a less because
there would have been more social life.
Because really as
far as -:;Le social life ~ent, tLere were tbe halls in flJiller
and f.1etcalf and people visited tLere ar:!d one thing and anotl:er,

It was also prohibition at tLat

when I was in college.
So it must have been after.
As far
as - I don't think prohibition was in when I was in coll~ge.
Do you rem e mber when prohibition came in?
KL:

I

think it would h a ve been, yeah.

AC:

KL: I think it would have been.
AC: Well, then that wa s it then.

I didn't realize it went on

35 min.

for so long.

KL: Maybe, I don't know,

I'd have to check.

AC: Yes.
But I do know that was the era, particularly th e
Charleston, which was kind of a ridiculous dance (laughs).

KL: That was very popular?
AC: Yes, very popular.

They wore long, narrow dresses and
fancy shoes and you sort of kicked up your heels (laughs).

KL: \ihat kind of bc.ind s
dances?

would they have to come in to rlay fer

AC: I don't remember name bands.

t o do.

KL:

Oh,

I

see.

AC: And you would dance, you could aance the Charleston
together.
It was not like a waltz or something.
You
separated like, ob like you do now.
And everybody would have
certain steps.
It was more group.
KL: Another thing that I saw in the yearbook that got my
curiosity going and didn't offer any explanations.
They keep
t a lking about all-college song contests and freshman song
quizzes and things like this.
Do you remember?
AC: I know that tLere was a lot of singing.
Well just now,
like they
have glee clubs.
But I don't remember too much
about them.
v,' l~ en they had a
choru~,
d ia they l:.ave a mixed choru s
they could have men ana women together?

KL:

so

AC: Oh, no, I don't remember any mixed choruses.
Now, like
chapel, we would go to everyaay, of course, 9:00 I think it
was.
You went to class from 8:00 to 8:50 and then you went
to chapel at 9:00 and you stayed t i l l 9:25.
They had a choir
and an organ and the Dean spoke.
That is four days the Dean
spoke and the fifth day the student government had it.
They
gave you a pep talk and then they took up matters that were
disturbing them, you know.
Infringement of rules and things
like that.
v,'i th the chapel too, you could only have three
cuts a semester.
You had to gO to chapel at 9:00 every day.
But they a ia have a very nice choir ana everybody sang.
'Cause
I aian't sing very well, I never did, so that I'm not s ure
tbat - I dor"' t remember ti:e conte s ttc.
j\:aybe that was because
my interest wasn't there, but I'm sure ~l l ey mUBt h ave had
them.
KL: While you were there,
or organizations?

were there any political movements

AC: No.
I know ~Lat there were a few girls in tLe class who
were reall y interebted in more individual freedom, I tLink.
For instance, you weren't allowe ~ to smoke.
~ell they were
bound and deter~ined they were going to smoke.
And drinking,
you know, and ~hines like that.
Alsc there was one girl who
lived with a boy which ....' as a n unh e ard of tLing in ~hose days
(laughs) .
So tr,ere were a few, but it d idn' t seem as if it
was a g ruup thing.
It s eemed as if it was like individuals in
the cla ss \"ho wa ntec to e.xpre s £; tLeir o\,n individuality.

Fembroke.

tI,ey changed the name to

AC: Yes.
hL:

Were they arguing about that

w~ile

you were

t~ere?

AC: Some, but not a great rieal.
I den't think t~ere was the
same kind of involving everybody in why you were doing something that there is now.
Because of course, tl.e student
body wouldn't accept just being told now.
I remember, maybe
because i t ' s closer, tLc furor thnt there was about the
alumni later cn being one big organization instead of
women alumnae anb ~en alumni, you know, and tt_ings like t~at.
There was a lot of furor then about loss of identity which
too~ place onl~ a fe~ years ago of cours e.
I den't remember
any discussior,s abeut wk.;;.: we cl.anged it.
Because peorle just
talked about - well our degrees are from t~e ~omen's College,
but now i t ' s Pembroke College, and then of course latter on
it beca~e just Brown.
But ~e always got a Brown degree, and
tl: is was very important to us, "tLen as of now, somehow or
another.
It stood for a great deal more.
I think we did feel,
really, that we were part of the universitj, although we
didn't mingle.
hL: Do you remember peorle beine bothered by the name change
to lembroke?
AC:

~o,

not at all.

KL: how abou"t v-'hen tLey mer£ed v:i tL Lrohn?
v,'as, it ju s t tr.e 

fact tiiat you didn'"t "ant ti. e alumni organizations te merge? 

AC:

No,

it vias tLe r:-,erge wi tL brown.
I think tLere was the 

of a loss.
TLe alumnae association grew up too, sepa­ 

r~te,
you know.
And it ~ab quite a strong organi~ation.
You 

were glad "to be a part of it and you wanted to work with it. 

It seemed to us at t~a"t point - o:f course the younger people, 

I think, wanted it, the newer classe s.
Because to them they 

were Erown anyway, really.
Eut the older classes who Lad grown 

up as a separate enti t;y I think t~ought they were losing some­ 

tLing.
I think you see it nov: in tl":is establishment of t he 

~omen's center. (~Lone rings) Excuse me.

KL: And then they changed it agaln.
AC: And then thet changed it again llau g hs).
Except for the
fact that they thought they were going to lose s omething, I
think, some of th e older clas s e s - everybody always wanted to
be frum Erown (laugh s ).
So there was that element always.
KL:

I

notice that you usually .ay Brown,

most of the time.

AC: Yes, and the thing is th a t, now when the women's center
was being established, there was some talk a b out bringing in
the name of Pembroke.
I don't know in ~hat way, but I heard
somebody say "they better not forget that i t ' s still Brov.'n
too" (laughs).
That was all.
Now wI,a tever notes I have here
that might - let' E see - I don't think so except that, now
days when ti,e fre s Lman clasf:;; comes in do tlJey t: et assigned
a senior?
KL:

I

don't think so.

Well, that's another thi~g that we had when we were there.
I came in then, I was assigned to a senior.
She was
supposed to help to guide me throuch the way it was at Brown.
And I was supposed tc be able to go to her and talk wit}. her
about problems I might have and things like this.
It was
more tLat you'd have someone there who had been throu g h tLe
ropes so to speak, and was free.
Then when you became a
senior, you Lad a freshman, and you did the same thine.
You'd
become qui te friendly v.'i th them, you know, and go out wi tL tLem
socially ana so forth.
But, it wasn't a close relationshi p
t.r.a t ke p t up day by day because of c o urse tI1ey i .ad the ir own
friends nnd their own interests and you were establishing
your own friends and your own intere s te.
The thing I do
remember about the social part o f it is that R group of us
always got togetl:.er £or lunch, we brought our ovm lunch
45 mln.
generally.
I tl.ink we ate in Pembroke hall or if it was warm,
on tr"e campus.
And this grour got together, and then after­
wards we ",'ould maybe go off to tL e movies together or t}:e ballet
or t1:e plays tLa t t}:ey ha c downtown in }'rov id ence, and EO furth.
That really was most of the social life, except when you went
to dances or they had a big dance and you went there.
But
that was the tbing tr:at I still remember anci tl:.ose peorle ­
well Doris for instance, Stapleton a nd I we re very close.
She
lived in S cituate (nhode Island).
S o she used to come and
stay overnigLt sometimes wit}. us at our house so that she
wouldn't have that long tri p back and forth.
We became close,
and t L ree or four otbers of the girls tr:a t were real close to
me.
Our aocial life was getting together like that At nOon
time or during the day and going together places.

know how peo p le wov.ld put up wi tr; it now - but it Eort of
sho\>.s, I think, at the level we were as far as dependency
and inde~endency went.
Because i f there was a senior coming
alon g , you had to run and open the door f o r them, (laughs)
things like that.
You really did have to go by the rules as
far a s drinking and smokine wer e concerned, and things like
that.
That was about it, I gue s s.

answer, but I think I'll just as k it anyways.
Just on an off
chance.

KL:

Yeah,

No,

'cause see,

then I

wasn't interested

yeah.

AC: Of course we studied even in the courses I took after I
got into the field before I went to graduate (school), Jane
~dams and Mary Richmond and people like that.
I don't remem­
ber hearing her.
And I don't think that at that time I was
so involved in thinking about it.
I was thinking academically.
KL:

Yes.

I ' l l try it anyway.

we did study Jane

hhen you left college, had your goal s changed from

Or they didn't really change

AC: ho, t i l l a couple years afterwards, ye s .
When I began to
realize that, not that I didn't want to teach I tl, ink, but that
I realized that I would have to stop and wo v.ld have to go in
and really get some educational training.
And then I would

ucation at Brown.
From the Dean on down, it was very impor­
tant tLa t v.'Omen sLould have an ed uca t ion, and tLat they should
be allovied to go ahead as far as - we had girls in our class
like SaTaL who became a doctor and Sylvia Berkman who became
a writer and teacher of English at Wellsley, and things like
tr~is .
These people did go ahead and tLey developed thernsel ves
individually.
But I didn't have that kind of a goal.
KL:

You didn't tLink you'd be cetting your master's degree?

AC: No, I didn't, until I got into the field that I really
loved anci really wanted to help the people I was working
with as my clients, you know.
Then I went to get my master's
so that I really could sharpen m7 skills and te able to
help trJem rr:ore.
That's wr:en I really did.
I took courses as
lone as I could on a part time basis.
But I had two children
and it ~eEmed to me it wa~ more important for them to be
started on their final education be~ore I took off.
We really
needed botI. pays, before I took off to get my master's.
But
I did take courses in between because I realized that I had
to bave more knowledge in it.
I didn't take any courses
like psychology or anything like that.
