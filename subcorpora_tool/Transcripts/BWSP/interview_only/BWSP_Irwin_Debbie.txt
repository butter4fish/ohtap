PHYLLIS SANTRY: This is Phyllis Santry, I'm talking to Debbie Irwin in New York
City on June 9th, 2014—part of the Oral History Project of the Pembroke Center
Associates. Debbie, I'm sure you took a look at some of these questions—it’s
basically diVided into three sections: your background, your experience at Brown,
and then your experiences going forward. So we have a few sample questions that
might get the ball rolling here, whatever you think is important to focus on, of
course, is up to you. Could you tell me a little bit about your family and your
background?

DEBBIE IRWIN: Sure. I don't recall actually ifyou said my name—I'm Debbie Irwin.
SANTRY: Oh, did I not say that? Oh dear. [laughter]

IRWIN: You may have, I'm a little distracted by the noise in the background, and I
hope that it's not a problem for the recording... So, I grew up in Chicago, and my
father was a professor of Entomology at the University of Illinois. And my mom was
and is a family therapist. We did a lot of traveling abroad because my father won a
Fulbright, twice, to study wherever he wanted. So we went to Rome and spent a
year there. Two times—the ﬁrst time, I was only two. But the second time I was
ten, and I went to Italian public school, so I became ﬂuent. We would also spend
many summers in Mexico because he would do research there as well. We would
drive from Chicago down to Mexico City or wherever it was. And so I developed an
affinity for languages and for travel.

I finished high school in three years and wanted to go away to college at that
point. In fact, my passion had always been theater and acting, and I wanted to go to
London, but my parents said no. [laughter] They said, "We want you to get a good,
solid, liberal arts education ﬁrst, and then you can do whatever you want to do."
And also they didn't want me to go away yet because they felt that I still had some
things to work on, emotional development—wise and, I guess, even with them—so
that was a year where we did some therapy together, I guess. But what I did, after I
graduated, was I went to the University of Chicago. So I matriculated there as a
freshman with the knowledge that I was going to transfer after that first year. That
was wonderful, I lived on campus even though [unclear 2:50] was only a matter of
blocks away. And then I left. Now, U of C, like many universities, has a core
curriculum—and since I knew I wasn't going to be there, I just took the courses,
pretty much, that I wanted to in writing. I didn't take any math or science for that

Irwin 2

ﬁrst year. And then I transferred to Brown, and I think it was lucky to have had the
experience of two different universities, top rated universities. What I say to people
is that I thought academically, the U of C was a bit superior. But socially—and I
think the university and college experience is a lot more... it's about a lot more than
just academics. Socially, there was, you know, no comparison. I mean, Brown was a
great place and a warm, and wonderful, and friendly, and enriching, and you

know—a wonderful place to spend my college years. So that's a little bit about my
family and childhood.

SANTRY: What was your first impression when you got to Brown? Had you been to
the campus before, did you see what it was like or what it was about? What made
you pick that?

IRWIN: I think I must have, but I really don't have any recollection. You know,
having... being a mom ofthree kids who have gone through that whole process...
Nowadays we're really much more involved with our kids. You know, we take them
here, we go there, we look at all these schools... [4:30] So I remember my parents
taking me there, moving me in. And, you know, I remember just loving the
campus—I don't think there's a soul who doesn't experience the campus and kind of
fall in love with in. I've interviewed a lot of kids who are applying to Brown, and I
do that. You know, anybody who I've spoken to who has been there [5:00] —there's
a magic there, on that campus. There was and still is.

SANTRY: Where did you live when you were a freshman?
IRWIN: I was a sophomore because I transferred.
SANTRY: Oh, right.

IRWIN: So I lived on the Pembroke campus, actually in some newer buildings that
are just off of Thayer Street. So I guess that's not technically the Pembroke campus,
but that side of town. And being a transfer student has its own... I don't know—
benefits, I suppose. And the benefit is that you've experienced two different places.
And so, I think, in much the same way that I've traveled and experienced other
cultures, you realize that there are a lot of different ways of doing it, whatever the
"it" is. On the negative side, you miss that wonderful magic that happens in the ﬁrst
year, that camaraderie that you develop with your freshman classmates. So you
come in as a transfer student, and you don't really know that many people, and it's
not as easy to get to know—you don't get to know your class, you know. You get to
know the people that you're living with and those you meet as you're there. So that
was one thing that I missed, I wished I had had that at Brown. So that was where I
lived sophomore year. And then my junior year, I lived on the Pembroke campus—
in one of the old buildings on the...

SANTRY: Andrews?

Irwin 3

IRWIN: Yes, I think so. And then my senior year, I lived off campus, in an apartment
on... what's the big street that's perpendicular to Thayer...

SANTRY: Waterman?
IRWIN: Waterman! Thank you. You're testing my memory. [laughter]

SANTRY: So, what do you remember most fondly about your time at Brown? Is
there anything that—

IRWIN: Um... Some of my teachers, whose names I don't remember [laughter],
doing theater there, dance, working with BCO, Brown Community Outreach...

[Other party exits 7:27]
IRWIN: What else—and working, actually. I worked while I was at school.
SANTRY: Oh!

IRWIN: At ﬁrst I worked at the Brown Derby. And then in the summers, I would
work for Food Services during reunion and graduation, during all those activities.
And I also worked as a cocktail waitress in the discos. That was a lot of fun for me
too because I loved to dance, and I loved that music. And it was for me to have a foot
in both worlds. That sort of idyllic campus life, but also be making money out in the
world too.

SANTRY: Oh, that's great. That's good. Now was there any part that you didn't like
about school? That stays with you, that you would have changed, or that you wish
hadn't happened?

IRWIN: No, not really. There was one—some courses you were required to take for
Pass/No Cookies, as we used to call it, Pass/NC? Did you [call it that]?

SANTRY: No, we didn't have that [laughter]

IRWIN: We called it Pass or No Cookies. And when it came close to graduating, you
needed to have a certain number of credits to graduate with honors. And I was just
shy a couple ofpoints, I guess, not credits. So I went back to—had it been my choice,
I would have taken all my classes for grades because that was just kind of me. So I
went back to one of my teachers, and I said to her—Tannenbaum, I think her name
was—I said, "This is my situation. I'm so close, is it possible for you to assign me a
grade if you would have assigned me a grade?" And she did. And I brought that to
the dean, and they allowed me to graduate magna cum laude.

SANTRY: Oh, that's great!

Irwin 4

IRWIN: That's a good story!
SANTRY: That's a wonderful memory, yes.

IRWIN: You know, I remember fondly—Here was the other thing that was kind of
wonderful. I got to the point at the end of my junior year where I realized that I
wasn't going to go on for advanced studies in my declared major [10:00] of
Psychology. And in order to complete the degree, the requirements for the degree, I
would have had to take a number of courses in the lab. You know, with mice, and
rats, and ﬁguring out how my taste buds taste and how my nose smells—and those
were things I just wasn't that interested in. So, given that I felt that I was in this
environment, this rich environment, and I had a wonderful opportunity to kind of
take whatever I wanted to—I switched my major to Semiotics, which gave me credit
for many, if not most of the courses I had already taken and allowed me to take
more courses in areas I was interested in. Literature, as an example. Writing.
Spanish. And that was really a great... great opportunity, for me. Because I think to
be forced to finish something that you know that you're not committed to, you
know—to what end? Okay, so I would have had a Psychology degree, granted you
never know what-ifs. And saying you have a degree in Semiotics, that has been a
little bit of an albatross around my neck because nobody knows what it means,
really. Not many people anyhow.

SANTRY: Ihad to look it up. [laughter]

IRWIN: Yeah, right! Me neither, right? But there were a lot of wonderful
experiences that came out of being exposed to Semiotics, and I think it actually did
speak to me and how I View the world—which is that there are lots of different ways
of Viewing and understanding those things we take for granted. I remember, in one
of the classes we watched ﬁlms, and we watched them with a critical eye to see what
those classic kind of signs were—you know, the bad guys in black, the so-and-so in
white. Things like that. Or how do other cultures put food on a plate, and what does
that say about the culture; not in every culture do you have the meat, and the
potatoes, and the vegetables spread out like that. So just having an appreciation for
seeing how messages are being communicated, whether we realize it or not.

SANTRY: Mm hmm.

IRWIN: Some of my favorite courses actually were in the sciences, were in
Neurology. You know, how the brain works—that's something that remains a
fascinating topic for me. I think my hardest class was Statistics. I was grateful for
the B minus that I got, which I think was my worst grade. But, you know, I was
really grateful for it. So, anyway. Those were some of my memories around classes.

SANTRY: Now what was your social life like when you were on campus? You said it
was hard getting started, being a transfer student, because you didn't have the initial
esprit de corps of being freshmen together. But after that, well you said you were in

Irwin 5

a theater group—did you hang out with those guys? Or just hang out with the
people you lived with?

IRWIN: Yeah, people I lived with. Other friends that I made, really across ﬁelds. I've
never been one to be kind of cliquey. I had friends who were dancers, friends who
were in theater, friends who—one of my best friends, Russian literature was her
thing. You know, I remember very fondly a boyfriend I had on campus. So I don't
ever remember feeling sorry for myselflike I didn't have a social life. I'm happy to
say I enjoyed myself, and I did well in school.

SANTRY: That's good. That's good. Now, did they have a lot of rules on campus by
the time you were there? I graduated in '66, and we had—you know, they were in
loco parentis—we had all kinds of rules. Now, when you were there were there a lot
of social rules or not so much?

IRWIN: I don't remember. I don't remember any. Such as what?

SANTRY: Oh, well I lived in a dorm: we had to be in by a certain time, you weren't
allowed to have men in your room, all of that kind of thing.

IRWIN: I don't remember having those rules. So I was there from 1976, and I
graduated in '79. [15:00] And then I spent another year living in Providence, in
South Providence, after I graduated. Which is another interesting story in and of
itself.

SANTRY: Yes, yes. Tell!

IRWIN: So all along I had a passion for doing theater, for acting. When I was in high
school, I was doing theater at the University of Chicago. When I went to Brown, still
doing more theater. And it seemed that that was going to be a difficult road to hoe.
So I started to get involved with the local television stations—the network afﬁliates,
WJAR and WPRI, I think? The ABC affiliate and the NBC affiliate. I did an internship
in the news department at one. I got a job working at the NBC affiliate as a ﬂoor
director. I also had my own women's public affairs radio show that they allowed me
to do for a while at the NBC affiliate. So I was getting my feet more wet in those
areas, thinking that would be an easier career path for me. And I always made
friends with people who were kind of behind the scenes. So one night after the
news—the news was over at 11:30 PM—and, you know, this was during the time of
Ernie Anastos and Meredith Vieira, people who have subsequently made it quite big
here in New York. So the talent went home, and I stayed—and my buddies in the
control room let me get on the set. And I brought fancy clothes to wear. So I got
behind the news desk, and they rolled back the teleprompter. And they recorded
me reading the news, so I could create a demo, right? A demo tape. So I had this
demo tape, and once I graduated I started sending it around to tiny little markets.
And I got no response. And I thought very quickly, "Well of course. Why would they
be interested in me? I have no background in journalism, so I don't the right CV for

Irwin 6

this task." And this is, mind you, after I'd graduated, and I'm liVing on the south side
of Providence—which at the time was not a particularly pretty place to be living, but
I had a fantastic apartment, and it was quite a different, like a hundred-eighty
degree difference from liVing up on the hill. So it occurred to me that if I wanted to
pursue this, I was really going to have to go to Journalism school. So I started to look
into that, schools up in Boston, and I realized that I was tired ofbeing in school. And
I didn't want to be in school anymore. And the other thing I realized—and this was
the epiphany. And I should say first, before I tell you what the epiphany was
because that's kind of the resolution—I spent a year liVing in this apartment,
working as a cocktail waitress in a disco that was on the river, and it was a disco of
some notoriety because we were the ﬁrst disco in Rhode Island to have male
strippers. And that, in and of itself, was quite fascinating, not because of the male of
the male strippers, but because of the women who came to see them. That to me
was like a study in sociology. Who these women were, three generations, how they
behaved... doing things that you just knew, once they walked out, they would never
do! So that, to me, was kind of really fascinating. And I was also competing with
myselfevery night to see how much I sold in booze. Then the owner of the club got
really excited about that, and he gave me a bonus for that—and then suddenly
everybody wanted to compete. And then it was a fun game: who rang up the most
for the night, and you earn a bonus.

So that was what I did at night, and by day I was laying on the mattress on
the ﬂoor in my apartment, staring at the ceiling through watery eyes. Crying and
crying and crying because I didn't know what I was going to do with my life. So, it
was through that time period of ﬁguring out, "Okay, nobody wants me unless I have
a Journalism degree," that I ultimately realized, and I say this a little bit tongue-in-
cheek: it wasn't the news that I cared about. It was being in front of the camera. So
that was the epiphany. And when I realized that, I realized, [2 0:00] "Okay, I have to
go to New York. And I have to pursue this dream of mine of doing theater." And
then it was clear. Then I had a mission and a goal. And I came to New York to
pursue that dream.

SANTRY: Were you in theater at Brown? Were you in Sock and Buskin and
whatever other theater groups there were? Or did they not have Sock and Buskin
when you were there?

IRWIN: I did many shows when I was there. Does it mean I was in the theater
group, I don't know. You know, I auditioned all the time.

SANTRY: What shows were you in?

IRWIN: It's funny, I'm remembering the ones from U ofC a little bit more... I'm
drawing a blank at the moment.

SANTRY: Okay, that's alright. Glad somebody else does that besides me. Now tell
me about what Brown was like back in your time. Was it as diverse as it is now?
When I was there, it was like three-quarters men, one-quarter women. About three

Irwin 7

or four black people. No Asians, no Hispanics, nothing. And then it changed
radically towards the end of the 60s. How about when you were there?

IRWIN: Well, I didn't really feel any male-female disproportion—there may have
been, but it wasn't like you're walking into a class, and you're the only woman, and
suddenly you feel awkward. I know, just based on what the statistics are now for
how diverse the populations are, that it couldn't have been even this poor back then.
But my boyfriend was actually from—he was black, he was from St. Vincent. One of
the islands. So I was aware of the, you know, not just African American population,
but you know. And where I grew up in Chicago, on the South Side—really, my
school, you could say, was segregated. I was in the minority, being a white person
there. Being around people of color and diversity is... comfortable for me.

SANTRY: And that's the way Brown was too, by the time you were there.

IRWIN: Yeah. Imean, you know—massively, no. Enough,no. But obViouslyIfound
those communities anyway. [laughter]

SANTRY: Yes! You did quite well for yourself. So did you spend much time off the
campus, doing other things other than studying and whatever?

IRWIN: Yes, yes. Because I had a car. So between working and going downtown,
and also volunteering with BCO —the Brown Community Outreach—and we would
take the minivan to South Providence. And I would tutor in some of those grammar
schools over there. And also going down to Newport, and going up to Boston. So
yeah, I got around.

SANTRY: I didn't know what ECG was. Brown Community Outreach? How long has
that been around? Do they still have it?

IRWIN: I think they do still have it. And probably a lot more because volunteering
and all is such a huge part of curricula these days. Even in middle schools and high
schools. It's almost required. And actually, my youngest goes to Tulane, and it's a
requirement as part of their curriculum. So, it wasn't at that time, but yeah—that
was another way that I got off campus. Again, I like to explore, you know. And so I
did.

SANTRY: What else does Brown Community Outreach do? They tutor, and is that
it?

IRWIN: No, I think it was a wide variety of things that you could sign up for. We'll
have to Google it and see. [laughter]

SANTRY: Were there any other sports, activities, clubs, anything like that that we
haven't talked about yet?

Irwin 8

IRWIN: I wasn't a sporty gal.
SANTRY: Me neither.

IRWIN: But I was a dancer, so I took a lot of dance classes. And I remember
swimming, for exercise. And also running in the track some, but mostly swimming.
[2 5:00]

SANTRY: As fun, not as a competitive sport.

IRWIN: Yeah, not competitive. I'm not competitive when it comes to sports.
[laughter]

SANTRY: Were there any political issues that shaped your experience in college?
I'm trying to think of the late seventies; there wasn't a lot of political stuff going on
then.

IRWIN: Yeah, I don't think so. I never really felt like the campus was brewing, you
know.

SANTRY: Like it was ten years earlier, yeah.
IRWIN: When you were there?

SANTRY: Yes. Oh yeah. Vietnam. Civil rights. Two major things going on, all the
time. Now how did you feel about women versus men at Brown? Did you feel
comfortable? Did you feel like you were accepted, you were appreciated
academically? Nobody talked down to you? Not like business. [laughter]

IRWIN: Yeah, I did feel respected. I think some of my fond memories ofteachers
were women, actually.

SANTRY: That's good.

IRWIN: Yeah. It's so important to find great teachers. And as I've counseled my
kids, if you can find a great teacher, it really doesn't matter what they're teaching.
Because you'll learn, and you'll enjoy the learning. Because that's what great
teachers do. I think they instill a love for their topic.

SANTRY: Is there anything you would change about your Brown experience? If you
could do it differently now, would you have taken different courses? Would you
have tried different extracurricular—

IRWIN: I think maybe ifI could have gone back and gone there from the beginning, I
think that that would have enriched my experience, in a way. Because I feel like I
got—not that I got left out, but that that was not a part of the experience there. And

Irwin 9

I didn't stay in touch with my freshman friends from the University of Chicago. It
wasn't easy like it is now, to stay in touch with anybody and everybody. So I didn't
have that, and I know people who say, "You make friends for life your freshman
year." I know it's true of my husband. He went to Providence College, and he's still
friends with his college buddies. And [unclear], yeah. So I missed that. But no
regrets, really.

SANTRY: So, you think it was a good move to move from Chicago to Providence?
IRWIN: Definitely. Oh yeah, yeah. Definitely. I wasn't going to stay in Chicago.
SANTRY: Did you have any siblings that went to school in Chicago?

IRWIN: I have three siblings: an older brother, an older sister, and a younger
brother. My sister and younger brother got their PhDs from the University of
Chicago after going to Oberlin and Grinnell. My older brother had gone to the lab
school there. But nobody went to Brown.

SANTRY: You struck out! On your own.

IRWIN: I did. I did. I would like to go back in time and try to remember how that all
happened. You know, how did I ﬁnd Brown, and what was that process like for me?

SANTRY: It is funny how it can be very random, why you end up going someplace.
And when it's such a major part ofyour life, you know. It has such an effect on
everything you do for the rest of your life. You want to grab these teenagers and
say, "Look, this is really important! You've got to figure this out now. Don't do it
because of like... you know, their jackets, or their team name or their whatever!"

IRWI N: Right.

SANTRY: Okay, is there anything else we should talk about—college experiences,
have we left anything out?

IRWIN: I have very, very fond memories of being at Brown. And I say it with pride
that I went there. [3 0:00] Certainly there's a tremendous cache that has continued
to follow all of us, I think.

SANTRY: My God, yes.

IRWIN: Even when I've gone back to the campus, it's still—I'd love to do it again.
Actually. I would love to do it again. And this time perhaps with the Pass/No
Cookies. [laughter]

Irwin 10

SANTRY: We've already talked about this one, did you have any specific
expectations of what your future would be after school. Obviously not, you were
still trying this, trying that.

IRWIN: Yeah, I was still figuring that out.
SANTRY: You had specific career plans, but you changed those as a result of your—

IRWIN: Yeah, I guess so. I guess so. I had a path that I thought was the right one
until I realized it wasn't. I had some unfinished business to do, and that was to come
to New York and pursue this dream of acting.

SANTRY: And how did that go for you? The acting.

IRWIN: Well, like for many other twenty-one year olds, twenty-somethings that
come to the Big Apple—it was daunting. Fortunately, I have family here, relatives.
My parents were originally from New York, so I had aunts and uncles here. But I
found an apartment rather quickly and I spent a couple of years struggling. You
know, going on those cattle calls for auditions. And I did a little bit of classical
comedy with a company that performed in public spaces and also in projects.
Projects—not in the projects. I did some children's theater. I had a walk-on part on
All My Children—and it was so quick that even my mom didn't recognize me.
[laughter] And by night I worked as a bartender in a disco. So that was how I made
ends meet. And that was a great experience also.

And after a couple years of doing that, I realized I was ready to move on. I
wanted some structure in my life, and I wanted a regular paycheck, and I wanted
whatever was next. I felt like I had satiated that desire enough so that I would never
wake up one morning when I'm forty with kids and saying, "Oh! Why did I never do
that!?" No. I did it so I could be free of that nagging desire. So then I found a job at
the Guggenheim. At the Guggenheim Museum. I worked there in public affairs.
Dealing with the press, the public, we were the internal liaison also, for all the
various departments. And that was wonderful. I loved being around the art, and I
loved learning about the art. But after a few years there, I realized a couple of
things. PR was not a passion for me. It wasn't something I wanted to continue—
one. And, two, that people in the arts and/or the non-profit sector really need to be
independently wealthy or married to someone who is, and I was neither.

So I had gotten to the point where I wanted to make money. And I decided to
go to Wall Street then, and I became a stockbroker. I wanted to understand finance
and help women, in particular, also understand ﬁnance. Because the actuarial tables
show we outlive our husbands, so why not learn about it sooner than later? So I had
a very successful career as a stockbroker, first at Dean Witter, then Smith Barney
hired me away. So I spent five years as a broker, experienced Black Monday. And
then I like to say I left Wall Street for Sesame Street when I decided to become a full-
time mom. And I had one kid, two kids, three kids, and did that for many years. So
between three kids, two homes, a bevy of animals, and one husband, that was a lot
to juggle for many years. And I was very happy and fortunate that that was all,

Irwin 11

quote unquote, I was doing. And periodically, my mom would ask me, when we
would be on the phone, "Have you thought about what's next?" [35:00] And I would
get so frustrated, "Mom! What do you mean what's next? I can't get through this
day, never mind tomorrow and what's down the road." And this was not early on,
after I'd already been into the third kid and et cetera, et cetera. But she planted a
little seed, and I like to tell this story because I give her tremendous credit. I credit
her with where I am today because of that nudging. That periodic, "have you
thought about...?" "Have you thought about what will be next? What will you do for
you?" So, over the span of easily a few years, I'd say, I thought about it in the back of
my mind. What would be next? Would I want to go back and be a stockbroker
again, and build that business from zero? No. I thought about maybe selling to the
brokers, you know, as a possibility. And I thought... No. I can't have a nine-to-five
job now. I'm still way too busy juggling everything that I'm doing with these three
kids in the city. And then I thought about theater. And I thought, "Well, I can't do
that. That's nights and weekends. I'm not available nights and weekends." And
then what I did was I got the NYU School of Continuing Education book—back when
they still produced a book, and it was easily an inch or two inches thick. And I
would go through that, which to me was a library of ideas. And also the 92nd Street
Y has a huge program of all different kinds of courses you could take. So it was kind
oflike being in a candy shop, and sorting through and looking to see what looked
appetizing. And in fact, I found a course for voiceovers. And I didn't really know
what voiceovers were, but it sounded interesting to me. So I decided to take the
class. And within ﬁve minutes of being in the class, I knew that I had found it. I had
found what it was that I was meant to do. So I like to say that I'm liVing my dream. I
just didn't know it was going to look like this because everything I'd done up until
this point has helped me to be successful at this career, which is a combination of all
these other things.

SANTRY: How long have you been doing it? Been doing voiceovers?
IRWIN: I took that class ten and a halfyears ago.
SANTRY: Oh! So you've been doing it for a while. Wow...

IRWIN: My youngest is nineteen. I have a twenty-two year old and a twenty-four
year old.

SANTRY: Wow.

IRWIN: Now my mom is eighty-four years old, and she's still working. My dad's
ninety-two.

SANTRY: What does your mother do?

IRWIN: She's a family therapist. So...

Irwin 12

SANTRY: Well no wonder she wanted you to think about what you're going to do
with your life.

IRWIN: Yeah. And she—my sister did not stop working when she had her kids. And
my parents were very supportive of my decision, and I felt a little bit like a salmon
swimming upstream because in the nineties, it was all about doing it all, right?

Being a career woman, and not getting off that ladder to success in order to have
your kids. So I spend many days in the park with the nannies, you know. But I
didn't want to give my kids to anybody else to raise. I wanted that job for myself.

SANTRY: And you're glad you made that choice?

IRWIN: Oh yes, absolutely. Absolutely. And I'm thrilled that I have this career now
and also [am] happy that my kids were able to see me make this happen for myself.
Because there's an important message in that too.

SANTRY: Sure.

IRWIN: And I remember many years ago—I don't remember how old my son was at
the time, maybe he was ten or twelve or something—and he had the gall to say to
me, "Well, you don't work." Or something like that. So you know, in the eyes of your
kids, or at your home, maybe another friend's mom is home, but most ofthem
perhaps not, and so on. [40:00] Anyway, obviously that changed. And I didn't let
that comment go by without... yeah.

SANTRY: Good for you.
IRWIN: Giving him a piece of my mind. [laughter]

SANTRY: Have you done any social, or political, or religious, or anything like that
actiVities outside of work? Interested in politics, or?

IRWIN: Um... Politics, not so much. Prior to starting my career, I did a tremendous
amount of volunteering. Both in whatever schools my kids were in—and often
times, that was three different schools—and also at our temple up in the Berkshires.
You know, from fundraising on down to specific things in the classroom. Ultimately,
our kids went to spend some time at The Churchill School and Center, which is a
school for kids who have learning differences. And that journey—coping with
learning about my kids and their struggles, and how to address them—became an
area that is deep in my heart, that I care about a lot, and I could see myselfworking
in at some point down the road. How kids learn. How can we change the
educational system so that these specialized schools, where kids are really being
offered the opportunity to learn however they learn best, can be the norm instead of
the exception? I started a program at The Churchill School, about seven years ago. I
started it for the high school students, called "Lunch and Learn." And in that
program, we bring in adults—oftentimes parents but not necessarily parents of

Irwin 13

students who are there—to talk about their careers, and how they got there, and
what are the skills involved in what they do. In order to open these kids' minds and
consciousness, really, to all the different jobs that there are out there.

And what gave me this idea was when Josh, my oldest, was looking at schools
for college. So he was a junior, I guess. I remember we were at a holiday party, and
you're going to get asked—generation after generation, you're going to get asked,
the same kid—"Oh, what schools are you looking at?" And "What do you want to
study?" "What do you want to major in?" And ]osh had no idea, and he had no idea
even of the "ologys." Of, you know, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology—nothing.
So later I pulled him aside, I said, "You know, Josh, you have to come up with an
answer. Even if it's not true. You have to have an answer because it's a
conversation ender to say 'I don't know.’ And does it matter really, if you say one
thing and it's not true?" You know, most kids change their major seven times. Or
people change their careers seven times. So at that point I realized he really had no
idea what was out there. And I thought, "wouldn't it be great to expose him and
other kids to all the choices?" And in the process, what's happened—and I take great
pride in this—is invariably there is a spark that happens in that room between the
speaker and one kid in the group who is turned on by something that they've said,
or is speaking to a fear oftheirs, or a dream of theirs. And I'm a big believer in
serendipity, and that you just never know when something’s going to happen that
could change the trajectory ofyour life. So this program, in my mind, is an
opportunity to create a fertile ground for that to possibly happen. And even though
my kids have been gone from the school for a while, I continue to manage that
program. Coordinate that program.

SANTRY: You still do. That's great. Where is The Churchill School?

IRWIN: It's on 29th Street, between 1st and 2nd. It's called The Churchill School and
Center. It goes K through 12 now. It's been around for forty years now. It wasn't
always—you know, it started as just whatever grade they started with. And the high
school, [45:00] I think, is not quite a decade old.

SANTRY: That's great. That's wonderful. That's really good. Doing something with
the semiotics too. As you say, people learn differently. Different symbols,
different—when I was looking up semiotics, I was thinking about clothes. You
know, how much clothes say about you.

IRWIN: Uh huh.

SANTRY: You know, if you wear those little hanging-down pants in the back, and
what that means—that you're tough. [laughter] How you're making a statement,
you know. Interesting. Interesting ﬁeld.

IRWIN: Right. Right. Well, and actually it's something that I incorporate in my
business. When I go out to an audition or to a job, I wear my colors—the colors that
are my branded colors, that you'll find on my website, on my business card—so as to

Irwin 14

reinforce that message about me. That I'm professional, I'm put together, that I'm
not showing up in jeans, you know. I take my work seriously, and I dress the part.
Present day outfit excluded. [laughter]

IRWIN: We won't tell you what I'm wearing. You'll just have to guess. Although,
there are a lot of jokes about voiceover artists because we get to work at home
oftentimes, you know, we're working in a booth. What are we wearing? Or are we
wearing anything? [laughter]

SANTRY: Show up in whatever. How do you get your jobs? Do you have an agent,
or do you just do it through your website, or what?

IRWIN: All of the above. I have a number of agents, and I also freelance. I get work
from my website. I network. There are also casting sites, or voice bank sites, that
pair job seekers with voice talent. So I'll get maybe twenty, thirty auditions in the
course ofa day that I can choose to audition for or not. And I do that from home.
And there are hundreds of other people, so the competition is stiff. And other times
I'll get calls from agents or from casting directors to go in to audition for projects
where I'm auditioning live at whatever studio here in the city. Because of the
internet, now you can be anywhere and book anything. But by Virtue of being in a
major city, it's great because there's a lot that's happening live and in person. And
that doesn't happen, necessarily, for someone who's liVing in a tiny town. Who
could still compete, but they won't be going to sessions in person. And that's a really
important dynamic, you know.

SANTRY: Do you always try out for every audition that you are inVited to?

IRWIN: Uh, no. I don't try out for all of them. And most jobs I have to audition for—
the wonderful ones are where they call you and say, "We want you. We booked you
off your reel." Or, then once you develop a relationship, people come back because
they know what you're capable of. Or they know what they've hired you to do
before. Maybe they're not entirely—maybe they don't know everything you're
capable of, but you know.[laughter]

SANTRY: Yeah. The president of my company used to always smile when he
answered the phone.

IRWIN: Uh huh. Oh yes.
SANTRY: He swore that people could tell if he was smiling.

IRWIN: Well they say that all the time! Put more smile in it. That's a direction that
we get, and it is true. And it actually speaks to an interesting phenomenon—which
is movement is necessary for emotion. When people stand at the mike and then
they just kind of talk like this—that’s just not how we talk. That's not how we

Irwin 15

converse. And the simple act of putting a smile on your face is going to make that
sound just that much sweeter. It's fascinating.

SANTRY: Yeah. I used to watch him do it.
IRWIN: Where did you work?

SANTRY: I worked on Wall Street, for a Wall Street ﬁrm. Now, a couple more things
I wanted to talk about. Where there specific ways that your time at school
inﬂuenced the choices that you made in the years to follow? Can you think of a
speciﬁc thing at school that drove you into this, or encouraged you to do this, or not
so much?

IRWIN: A metaphor just popped into my mind that I remember post-graduation.
And that was that being in college is like being in a restaurant. And you're handed a
menu, and you get to pick whatever you want off that menu. After college, you have
to write the menu yourself. [50:00] And it's a whole other ball of wax. And that was
part of the struggle of that year, for me. I didn't just knee-jerk go into whatever, you
know. I know a lot of kids now, they'll knee jerk—they graduate, there's no jobs,
they'll go to law school. But I knew that whatever I was going to do, I had to feel
passionately about it in order to find the energy and the motivation to do it. So
anyway, the menu metaphor.

SANTRY: Well, it's appropriate. And then, just wrapping up here: remembering
about school, how did it change during the time that you were there? Were there
any major social changes, academic changes, anything like that? Or did you feel like
it was all pretty much [a] good, happy place to grow, to develop, to try all kinds of
different things? I remember thinking, when I was there, I loved the fact that you
could just try anything. You could take any course you wanted, you could try out for
any sport or any activity. You didn't have to ﬁt in to anything, and that's what I
really liked about Brown. I think that's what people still like about Brown. But was
there anything that stuck out in your mind?

IRWIN: No, you know. Again, I don't know ifthey're rose-colored glasses, but I just
have very fond memories ofliVing in Providence and being in school there. You
know, like Goldilocks, I think that it wasn't too big, it wasn't too small—it was just
right. There was enough of a city there—it wasn't a big metropolis, but you weren't
in the cornfields. Yeah, it was just perfect.

SANTRY: We don't need to talk about the men's college... Have you any thoughts
about staying in touch with Brown? You said your freshman year you missed that
whole esprit de corps thing, have you stayed in touch with other—Well you
obviously liked your school experience, or you wouldn't be doing the interViews. Do
you still do interviews for them?

Irwin 16

IRWIN: Yes. Yes I do, and it's fascinating. It's really incredible to talk to these kids
and see how much, how accomplished they are and how bright they are—it's just
daunting. You know, I didn't stay in touch. In subsequent years I've tried to locate
people without success, with the exception of that boyfriend. [laughter] And that
pains me, a little. Because I think there's something really precious about shared
memories. And the further away I get from those memories, the harder they are to
recall. And so I would like to reconnect with those people. I did go to my twenty-
ﬁfth reunion, and I brought my family. And I didn't know anybody. My kids were
like, "Mom, didn't you have any friends here?!" [laughter] Like, "Yes! I think I did! I
just don't see any of them!" But being in New York for the last thirty-odd years,
oftentimes I'll recognize people. I have a very good Visual memory—so I'll be like,
"You went to Brown, didn't you?" They'll be like, "Yeah, how did you know?" I say,
"Well I don't know your name, but I know your face."

SANTRY: Semiotics. Symbols. Pictures.
IRWIN: There you go.

SANTRY: Now what do you think about how popular Brown is now, you know,
compared to when you were there and more so when I was there. Maybe do you
think it's like... not the right way to go? My sister says, "Oh, well movie star's
children go there." Which is sort of a put down.

IRWIN: Well, you know, Kate Burton was in my class. She was there when I was
there. And I remember Salzburger, I think, the New York Times dynasty—their kids
were there. You know, I think it has a reputation for being a place where kids are
happy. And there's nothing wrong with that. [55:00]

SANTRY: Good.

IRWIN: Au contraire, right? [laughter]

SANTRY: Okay, is there anything else that you wanted me to ask you that I didn't?
IRWIN: No, no. You covered a lot of territory. I think maybe just reconnecting now,
and trying to establish new friendships through the Brown Club. You know, I've
tried to go to some of the events to meet people. Sometimes I'm shy. But I think it's
a way of keeping the love alive, you know?

SANTRY: Oh yeah.

IRWIN: Do you go to them?

SANTRY: I do. And I'm retired now, and mostly it's people who want to make

business connections. And so they're not really that interested. I went to that thing
at Lincoln Center for the 250th party, did you go to that?

Irwin 17

IRWIN: No, no.
SANTRY: It was very interesting. It was interesting. Generally the Brown Club
things are not—they're for younger people. They're more interested in business

connections.

IRWIN: Well I went to one that was wonderful. It was a private tour of the Hopper
show at the Whitney.

SANTRY: Ooh, wow! Cool!

IRWIN: That was so fantastic. I really wish they would do more things like that.
SANTRY: Okay, well should we wrap it up?

IRWIN: Yeah! Definitely.
