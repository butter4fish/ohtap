Cindy Weinbaum: This is Cindy Weinbaum and I’m talking to Reverend Anita Schell-Lambert.
She was born February 13th, 1957 -- the daughter of Theodore Schell and Anne Hess Schell. And
her parents -- her father was self-employed and her mother a homemaker. She is married and has
two children -- Theodore age four and Rachel age six months. OK. And where are you from?
Anita Schell-Lambert: I’m from Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
CW: All right. (inaudible) and did you parents go to college?
ASL: Yes. They both went to school in Lancaster called Franklin and Marshall.
CW: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
ASL: They graduated from there. My mother could not because she was (inaudible) Franklin and
Marshall in the ’50s.
CW: But she still went to school?
ASL: Mm-hmm. She was -- she was pretty damn awesome. [01:00]
CW: OK. Did -- OK. How and why did you decide to go to Brown?
ASL: OK. Brown appealed to me for many reasons because of its excellent reputation, because
of its high academic standards, because it was an Ivy League school, because it was in New
1

England, because of its strong English department. All of those were interests and concerns of
mine. Also, because of the -- it’s very innovative and flexible curriculum, which is also
something that’s really important.
After I visited the school, I was even more excited about it than when I -- than just the
paper because it clearly was all those things in addition to being a very friendly environment
both in terms of staff, teachers, professors, and, most of all, students. So, all those factors kind of
combined and when I -- was very excited once I got there, there were many other [02:00] very
exciting things about it that really (inaudible) appealed to me before that.
CW: What year did you go?
ASL: I went from ’75 to ’79.
CW: OK. And, so, it had already been -- Brown had already been co-ed for years before that.
ASL: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
CW: Did your family have any say in where you went to college?
ASL: Well, they pretty much left that up to me. They were -- they wanted me to go to a good
school that had a good liberal arts background. I was way more -- much interested in that than
science. So, that wasn’t completely (inaudible) student arts. And then with (inaudible). I loved
Brown. I loved New England. So, that was it. They were very happy about that. They didn’t
force their school or their own preference on me at all.
CW: Mm-hmm. They weren’t worried about Providence being a city and anything like
(overlapping dialogue; inaudible)?
ASL: No. Not too much. [03:00] They often prayed when I went to New York City. But -CW: (laughter)

2

ASL: -- it turns out we had some bad experiences in Providence. It’s a (inaudible) city. And, you
know, our car was stolen. I was robbed twice. So, we’ve had our share of difficult life in
Providence. But they weren’t frightened by that -- and also because I lived on the campus my
first three years.
CW: Gotcha.
ASL: You know, to that -- they weren’t -- when I moved to New York they were more worried -CW: (laughter)
ASL: But I haven’t any bad experience in New York, however!
CW: Did they have any expectations about what you would do with a college education?
ASL: Their expectations and mine (inaudible) were to get a good education because I’m a bit -I’m self-motivated. They weren’t too worried about what I would do, which I was happy about. I
think we set it off and we are so career-oriented, so goal-oriented -- we don’t enjoy education for
itself, which is one think I loved about Brown [04:00] -- just the sheer love of learning. And my
parents really encouraged that of me because they always knew that I wouldn’t just sit back and
just not do any work while I had -- but it was important for me to enjoy what I was doing just
even for the sake of doing it. And, as it turned out, I had applied that, you know, I enjoy -- I
enjoyed my English major for what it was and not having to think it was only a stepping stone
for something else.
CW: Mm-hmm. Did you -- you had brothers and sisters?
ASL: I have a sister who lives in Lancaster with her husband and daughter and they are
expecting a second child -- went to college, but that wasn’t a thing for her. I have a brother who
graduated from Worcester Polytech and was employed an engineer at New England [Aria?].

3

CW: Mm-hmm. So, did you ever find yourself -- yourself being compared to either one of them
as far as education is concerned?
ASL: No. I didn’t. I was happy about that, too. [05:00] My parents encouraged that we each are
individuals and what we did was what we wanted to do and we shouldn’t be compared -- I’m still
not similar to my brothers, but it wasn’t (inaudible) -- but not too much, which I so worried
about. And I -- and even my sister doesn’t compare. She clearly is not academic and that was
fine. She’s very happy and that’s really what my parents always stressed -- that what you gives
you greatest enjoyment and happiness is what should -- you should pursue, whether that’s an
academic route or whether that’s not, that’s really up to you. And they never pressured us. And,
consequently, we felt confidence, so we did well in school because we didn’t feel pressure to do
well. We wanted -- we just wanted to do well.
CW: That’s excellent. (laughter) OK. Well, can you tell me about your freshman year at Brown?
ASL: Oh, it was a great year.
CW: Yeah? You remember?
ASL: Oh, very well. And I’ll tell you when the highlight of it was going to Indian Choir and
[06:00] looking forward so much to our ten year India reunion in ’86. And remembering my
friends singing was my first love. And I auditioned for the choruses right away and I was very
much happy about the solo for the big piece we were doing in Indian as a freshman. I was all
excited about that. And I’ll never forget my parents’ reaction to India, “Oh, my good. Choose
Europe or something.”
CW: (laughter)
ASL: India may be safer now. No place seems to be safe right now to travel to, but -- but then it
was wonderful. And I remember taking all incompletes my first semester because we went in
January and, at that time, the semester was over in the middle, end of January. So, I took all
4

incompletes. But it was a wonderful year -- I -- first of all, I had a great roommate and we lived
in -- I forget the name now -- in the Pembroke Campus looking right off of [Meeting St.?]
[07:00] right at the -CW: Andrews?
ASL: Andrews. West Andrews we lived in on the first floor. And this -- a great roommate, just a
wonderful year (inaudible) by my involvement in the choir, but that was a great year. Just
wonderful.
CW: (laughter)
ASL: I loved the food.
CW: Really?
ASL: The food of that is pretty cool comparatively speaking if you’ve been to -CW: Yeah. To other schools...
ASL: -- to other schools really. It was a wonderful year.
CW: Yeah?
ASL: Once in -- what -- foundations committee and my major in Brown University. It was just -it was a marvelous year. Great time.
CW: Was West Andrews co-ed?
ASL: No. No. No. And I liked that. I felt the women’s dorms were somewhat quieter and I
always opted for women’s dorms. In second year, I lived in Littleton.
5

CW: Littleton? Littlefield?
ASL: Littlefield! Thank you. How quickly we forget. (laughter) Littlefield back on main campus,
which was a very, super location to the classes and I was reactive in seeing [08:00] Stevens -that was like right back behind -- oh, gosh. I’ve got to get back there. Oh, this is terrible.
CW: (laughter)
ASL: This is really making me homesick. I haven’t been, really -- toured the campus in a while.
And, then, my third year I was in Metcalf back on the -CW: Yeah. Pembroke.
ASL: Yeah, on the Pembroke campus. And in the fourth year, I lived on [Madford St.?]. So,
what was -- what was the question you were asking? What -- I liked West Andrews? I loved -loved the Pembroke campus, really. And I liked (inaudible) college better than (inaudible). It’s a
little quieter.
CW: Yeah. I like it, too. (laughter) Freshman year, your big involvement with chorus -- were you
doing anything else extracurricular?
ASL: No, because I was doing my three different courses and I was very active at St. Stevens.
So, those were my two major involvement, you know, with studies and rehearsal and -CW: What were you doing at St. Stevens?
ASL: I was in the choir there in employed congregation. [09:00] I was involved in multiple
activities at the church. Yeah.
CW: Uh-huh. Your family that you came from was very religious?
6

ASL: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Episcopalian. I’m now an Episcopal preach. But, yeah. Yeah. There
you are -- it was a good foundation for you to have that (inaudible) my parents with the
Episcopal chapter at Brown -- [David Banks?]. (inaudible) At times we still mix.
CW: Did you? I know that right now Brown has a really much more academic and, kind of, an
anti-religion bent. Did you feel that at all when you were there?
ASL: No. What do you mean by having an anti-religion bent?
CW: There -ASL: What do you -CW: It’s just that there are groups on campus, like Campus Crusades for Christ and those things,
that are kind of looked down on by the bulk of Brown society.
ASL: OK. Yeah, well, I’m not myself big on Campus Crusade. I think we have to be careful with
some of those -- how to -- [10:00] there’s nothing wrong with preaching what we believe, but
you know, coerce other people into l -- you know, every member Campus Crusade -- there may
not have been Campus Crusade in my years or maybe there was. I didn’t -- I didn’t sense that
people were -- an anti-religious vent. I didn’t feel that when I was at Brown. But maybe that it
traveled in circles that weren’t -- I don’t know. I had a lot of Jewish friends. I was at the Hillel
often for dinner on Friday evenings with my friends, so...while I had a lot of Jewish friends, a lot
of Christian friends I never felt an anti-religious feeling there. Sure, there are lots of academics
who are agnostics or atheists, but they weren’t negative. You know who was most negative was
some of the professors in the liberal studies department, ironically enough. So, my advisors were
there, but some of the other professors were agnostics -- somewhat kind of cynical about that.
But that’s where I felt it more than amongst the students.
CW: [11:00] OK. Do you remember what courses you were taking freshman year?
7

ASL: Oh, gosh. Oh, I should have worked all this out before you came. I st-- semiotics course
with the writer -- the dramatists -- I think it’s with an S -- his name. His name -- it’s English -- I
don’t know what -- I can’t remember his name, which -- it will come to me. I was taking a
French course with Professor [Richley?]. I took -- oh, gosh -- I was looking into the (inaudible) - I would walk to classes and try to remember all these [12:00] class staff. I think I took a music
class. I know I was taking voice. I was in a choir and that counted as a credit or two and I took a
course. I don’t know what all went on. Then, I took a course with [Jaws?], no (inaudible). So,
even in the beginning, I was taking an English, French, Music, and just studies. I really didn’t
dabble much in the -- outside of that kind of places.
CW: Were you really?
ASL: It was very limited -- very -- not -- no hard sciences like what you had.
CW: You really took advantage of the new curriculum.
ASL: Yeah. I did that. It was pretty clear all along that that was the route I wanted to go -- not
good at math and hard sciences and didn’t have much interest in -- later on, I took a biology class
and a psych class and all kind of -- basically, in my first year, I took a course in things like
English cla-- lit, English column, but if you asked me, I can’t remember. Of course, Jaws never
had any coursework, but (inaudible) music.
CW: OK. [13:00] Then -- oh, wait, so that was first semester you took those courses. Do you
remember second semester?
ASL: Oh, gosh. I’m having trouble. I forget if I took another French course, another religion
studies course I’m sure. But I can’t rem-- I can’t remember, I’m sorry.
CW: OK. (laughter)

8

ASL: I can’t remember back to that year.
CW: When you were a freshman did they have -- now, they have freshman units, which is, you
know, groups with resident counselors. Did you have one of those?
ASL: I don’t know that it was called that. We had -- freshman year it was all by how you were -where -CW: Where you were living. Yeah.
ASL: We had that somewhat in looser structure than what it is now. And we had a -- a counselor
who lived right on the floor. Loved him. Loved him. A student. But it was very loosely
structured. It was in the process of changing [14:00] when I was there. My second year and third
year, they were becoming more active with resident counselors and resident -- such as Barbara
[Tenenbaum?] does now and (inaudible) [Weinstein?] who does that. It wasn’t this well-defined
when I was -- not that’s it’s great to have three -- not as much of a event.
CW: Did you find that most of your friends were from your freshman -- the people that lived
around you as a freshman?
ASL: Not so much. That was a common thing, but I found more of my friends coming from -some of that -- but more of my friends came from the choir. We didn’t really click. It’s because I
got to know them a little more personally.
CW: Yeah. OK. Then, your second year you lived in Littlefield.
ASL: I lived in Littlefield. Uh-huh.
CW: And do you remember what you were taking that year?

9

ASL: (laughter) Again -- oh, I remember what else I took my first year! [15:00] Yes, Italian.
Yeah, that’s what I did -- Italian. But I forgot the professor’s name. Oh, I took Italian for a
number of years.
CW: Had you taken French and Italian in high school before you -ASL: I took French. And then I took more French and Italian and religion -- I too -- began some
classes with [Ernie Ferarish?]. He used to be in BU graduate school and now it’s just full time in
the English Studies Department. And that was the year I took a class -- not -- I hated my class -French class with Mages -- Magestski? [Mageski?]? Professor Mageski in the French
Department and a religious studies course and Italian. I’m sure there were some others that were
not -- I took a number of history classes to fulfill my major, but that was a little (inaudible)
[16:00] what I was doing in August in English Literature and I took some English history
classes. And, so, history of American Religion classes, which I loved. I can’t remember if that
was my freshman or my sophomore or junior year.
CW: And sophomore year you were still in the choir for (inaudible)?
ASL: Oh, I was the choir the whole time. There was a choir -- a number of other -- at that time
there was a chorus and, then, there was a choir, which was smaller and more selective. And there
was another music group I was involved in with (inaudible).
CW: Now, we have, like, small women’s singing groups. Were there any of those when you
were there?
ASL: No. I know that that has just started. It’s wonderful. A lot of ad-hoc groups with all
women. And when I was there, there was only one and they were called -- they were not
particularly good -- and they were called “[The Hi-jinx?]” (inaudible) because the hi-jinx were
the most -- you know, [17:00] the making out, choir. They were all pretty much the clowns. The
women’s group was...

10

CW: Is that the Chattertocks?
ASL: Yes. Yes. Chattertocks. Chattertocks. And they were good. One (inaudible).
CW: Yeah, they’re very good. OK. Now, let me see. What are the next set of things that
happened freshman or sophomore year especially? And the year of the (inaudible)?
ASL: I would enjoy staying the summer once school had ended and helping out every summer
with the French -- the professor (inaudible) would have a reception for the French students and I
would help make French pastries. That was a, kind of, fun kind of thing to do. And his wife had
started the Cordon Bleu, so it was really fun -- a fun time. But really centered in, then, on my
studies and the choir and, then, on the church.
CW: [18:00] Uh-huh. Then, over the summer you went back to Lancaster?
ASL: Yeah, I did that once as -- from freshman, sophomore, and junior years (inaudible). I -well, I was in (inaudible) -- that’s in Miami. Junior year I was in Israel. I mean, that’s in my
sophomore year. I’m sorry. My sophomore year, I went to Israel for the summer and was on a
dig in [Madon?] -- in the upper part of that country. And, then, dur-- and she said, during the
year sophomore and junior year, we did domestic tours. And the domestic tours -- we did the
[Quaidian?]. That sophomore year we went to Lancaster on -- as part of the trip. And the junior
year we went to Cornell, which was where my boyfriend, now husband, is in school. So, that was
kind of fun. And, then, so the domestic tours were fun too.
CW: Oh, that’s neat. OK. Then, junior year, were you -- did you keep taking Italian and French?
ASL: Well, French. [19:00] I was still taking French and more music and history and English lit
and -- oh, and a biology class.
CW: Mm-hmm. Was that introductory biology?

11

ASL: Yeah. It was -- I’ve forgotten the professor’s name. (inaudible) It was a great class for
people who were not -- not pre-med. (inaudible)
CW: And senior year you lived on [Beddiford St.?].
ASL: Senior year I was on Beddiford St. right down at [President, Coin, and Jewel?] (inaudible).
And I had stayed there that summer. It was a great summer in Providence where I worked with
food services for a while. We did the catering and that was real fun. So, there was that. And,
then, I -- I was always taking (inaudible). Then, I -- I was working. I was in -- there was a Gilbert
and Sullivan, kind of, street theater -- [Cabot St.?]? Is there a Cabot St.? I there’s a Cabot St. And
it was the Cabot St. Theater -- [20:00] kind of a side street off, back, kind of, more near the
Pembroke campus. But, anyway, I don’t know which direction you’re going off of four -- that’s
the [Han?] four not going towards Pembroke the other way. And we did the mercatto Impatience
and I was in the chorus and we made costumes and that was fun. I was working on my honors
thesis. And, so, that was a neat and I loved standing (inaudible).
CW: OK. What was the topic of your thesis?
ASL: The topic of my thesis was John (inaudible), you know, the poet from the 17th century -into the 17th century. And I (inaudible) he has a religion conversion to Catholicism through two
poems he had written in that transitional time in his life. (inaudible) pretty much got my research
done every summer.
CW: (laughter) That sounds good. What do you think is the most important influence on you
when you were at Brown or who? [21:00]
ASL: If it came down to one person, certainly one of the most influential -- also, was two,
different things. One, you could probably guess, was my involvement in the choir, which just -- I
also went every week (inaudible) in Boston. And certainly my chorus teacher, [Canoshere?], and
her old, lovely, crass humility was very influential as was all of my involvement in this
department. And the conductor, [Bill Herman?] was just superb -- nothing, but great to all of my
12

involvement. And, then, my senior year after I graduation, we went to China. So, this choir really
-- and that was a core group that had begun through -- it was incredible. [22:00] There was a core
group of us who were freshman the year we went to India, graduated and went to China. It was
luckily chosen. We were really special. That was a really neat -- so that’s what my most -greatest influence is. Another was my work at the church -- my involvement with the church -and one of my advisors -- excuse me -- whose name is [Ernie Ferarish?] who I mentioned who
was one of my biggest mentors. (inaudible)
CW: OK. I’m just going to turn the tape. I just want to make sure. Do you have any worst
memories of things that happened to you when you were at Brown?
ASL: Well, the robberies, I think, would be pretty strong key.
CW: Yeah. When were they?
ASL: Yeah, well, my freshman year at Andrews and my roommate and I were (inaudible).
[23:00] And the halls are rather dark and there are staircases that people could get it and, kind of,
roam the halls. It was very -- I mean, literally, what was taken was just basically some jewelry,
but it sort of was traumatic. Anything could happen when I was gone and even more traumatic.
After I had been away, come back and -- in the summer. Oh, yes. It was -- I had moved in and I
was coming back (inaudible). I think it was -- yeah, it was right before I began school again at -I had my -- my pad door was just there. Someone could saw and cut through.
CW: Oh no.
ASL: So, that was really awful. Then, my parents’ car was stolen right (inaudible). But those
were the other things. [24:00] And I wouldn’t mind sleeping if (inaudible). And I loved living
alone, but I was engaged at that point. It could be a little lonely, but basically, you know, we
stayed positive. (inaudible) (laughter) It was great. It really was great. But those were some of
the -- the (inaudible).

13

CW: Yeah, that sounds terrible. When you were living there, were the doors downstairs outside
to the dorms open?
ASL: See, that’s something. It was supposed to be locked all the time, but somebody left them
to let their friends at some point. Maybe they’re stricter about that now.
CW: No. That still happens. (laughter) Yeah. It annoys me.
ASL: Are you living in Andrews?
CW: Well, right now, I live in West Quad. And, although it’s mostly freshman, I live in a
singles room and it’s really -ASL: You said singles room? Oh, that’s where the single rooms are.
CW: Yeah. They’re like clusters of singles. There are two of them [25:00] in the West Quad. It’s
great.
ASL: I loved having a single room.
CW: Yeah. Did you live alone before your senior year?
ASL: Well, I was kind of -- interesting set up at Metcalf. I lived in the resident counselors suite
in Metcalf. You know, we got a good lottery number that year. So, three of us went in. And it
was a single room. Well, it was supposed to be a common, living room area. But we used that
living room area for two of us and we had our own bathroom, kitchen, and one of us had a
private room. And, then, second semester when the third person moved out -- just took a
semester off -- and so we even had both our own rooms now.
CW: Oh, they didn’t move anybody in?

14

ASL: Well, we kind of finagled it so they wouldn’t -- it’s not -- I probably -- I don’t know -- we
really wanted our own room. That was the only reason. So, that’s where we had a kitchen.
CW: And in a room that you -ASL: I lived on the third floor of the (inaudible) [26:00] with someone -- my friend -- and that
worked out very well. It was kind of all board and the room was small and it was -- I loved
having a kitchen. And it’s likely this dorm was closed because of -CW: Littlefield was the all women dorm?
ASL: Oh, yeah.
CW: Oh.
ASL: It’s not anymore?
CW: No, it isn’t. And it’s good now.
ASL: Oh. You know because I lived in Littlefield and I liked that. It was quiet. It used to be all
female and male and they were wrestling all the time. It was, “I can’t get any quiet!”, which I
like. Because I like to study in my room. I didn’t like to study in the library. (inaudible)
CW: Do you remember anything interesting about relations between male and female students?
ASL: [27:00] I was very lucky. Because I was pretty much religiously involved with a man who
at Cornell -- my husband now. I was really not hung up on having to look for guys and having to
go to any parties. And I was just lucky and, consequently, had a lot of great male friends who
are still great male friend. And I was really freed up from playing the likes where there’s a lot of
games and a lot of that, kind of, really can -- well, now, it looks even more -- sometimes it can be
very dangerous. Why announcing that the (inaudible). You know, it’s gotten worse. It’s gotten
much worse.
15

ASL: Were any of your friends involved in going to fraternity parties and stuff like that?
CW: A lot of them. And that was OK. That was pretty -- I mean, it seems to have gotten a bad
rap from some of the awful things that they do since they’ve gotten worse. And they are just
getting more -- I’m not down-turning because my husband is a member of one. But truly you
have to balance your time [28:00]. Because it’s not -- it’s kind of one slice of Brown. So,
(inaudible) this is one co-ed turned into a (inaudible) and my husband claiming he missed his
care because it was co-ed at our school. But I found that to be very good -- the male-female
relationship -- my own personal experience. I saw some interviews and I saw, you know, awful
behavior and just (inaudible) and I just -- a lot of, kind of, sexism there and I really detest it. But
it didn’t seem to be perverse. It seemed to be -- some of it centered around the fraternities. But,
basically, I found it a welcoming relationship school where you were -- and I was lucky to have a
lot of male friends -- friends who were (inaudible). I didn’t have any problems with anything
except for robbers. But there weren’t any attacks or any -- on males -- [29:00] or that. But after a
certain hour, I didn’t go out or I had male friends who would walk me home. And I was in the
position they were friends. There were significant benefits to that. So, I was lucky. I never -because I wasn’t looking for someone. You know, I had roommates who, kind of, brought a guy
in at night. Another guy this -- that kind of thing. But I felt very good and I had, just, a lot of
males friends. And, basically, some of my roommates’ friends. It was a real posse. It was very
nice.
CW: There’s a lot of weird stuff going on at Brown right now about, “Does dating go on at
Brown and why not?” Was there long-term dating at Brown? So, was there -- there was a lot of
dating when you were there?
ASL: Yeah. I’d say a fair amount. It’s hard to just date someone. See and I can’t say this because
I’m out so I don’t know more. [30:00] But, you know, there was pressure for men, you know, to
have the staples in the first night, you know, something like that. The pressure to perform was
tremendous. I would say there was a fair amount of dating. And I just lived alone, too. But

16

there’s a -- in my vein -- I’ve gotten an infection from (inaudible) events, but there’s less of that.
If you were walking with someone you almost had to be dating, you know?
CW: (laughter)
ASL: But when I was there, you just had a lot of friends. And I think that was just -- a lot of it
was generated by the really good thing -- choir. Just where all my friends happened to be.
CW: OK. Let me just stop this.
(break in audio)
Track 2
ASL: I may just be thinking more from what I saw at Cornell, but, sometimes, I picture a new
student in somewhat unnatural environments where men and women -- but, certainly, between
the sisters in sororities. You know that sororities were banned years ago at Brown as women
committed suicide over not having been -- you know, check the story on that. I don’t remember
details, but that’s my understanding.
CW: Was that why you there in (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)?
ASL: Oh, gosh. No. The school. Pembroke. The school at Pembroke. There’s enough
competition that we don’t need to be competitive about who is socially acceptable and with
fraternities and sororities we had. And that’s all been toned down -- some of the animal behavior
that’s existed in some of fraternities at Brown. I’m glad that the university has been -- a couple
of them have just been wiped off the map. And, then, we used to lie to the [Toad Hall farmer?] to
take the [toad?] out. [01:00] I mean, I think that really said something. It was a symbol of the
[memory?] of a very negative offense. So, I’m delighted that it’s gone. But they can be good.
There were some lovely parties at [Slark?]. [KTV?] was one of my favorite things -- a lot of
friends there. Lovely classes. So, it depends, but I’d rather see more things than just the choir in

17

others ways that we interact with people that are on a strictly male-female social-ranking, party
level.
CW: OK. When you were there was during the time that Sarah Doyle got her start. Were you at
all active in that?
ASL: A little bit. Not as much as I, upon hindsight, would have liked to have been. But I was
looking for discussion groups in the summer that had, kind of, pot-luck suppers and I would do
that. And, you know, just getting going was always -- and I had a number of friends who wrote
her after that and strongly supported. So, that’s great. So, it didn’t have much of a reputation at
that point. [02:00] It was just getting going. But it had a visibility and it was divided during my
time there.
CW: Mm-hmm. That’s good. While you were at Brown, did you have any career counselors or
any of that stuff?
ASL: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. More of that came through my advisors -- my academic advisors. In the
first two years, you’re assigned an advisor, you know, and then you -- well, at least, that’s what it
was when I was in it. And, then, you choose your resulting (inaudible) major, which I did. In
March I did mine. They didn’t officially credit my junior year, but certainly knew what it was
my sophomore year and had advisors in both English and Women’s Studies that acted as, kind
of, career counselors to me, as well as did my friends at the church. And, then, I did seek some
career counseling in the [Akula?] counseling center. And that’s changed, too. Gosh. I don’t
think I’ve visited in years. That’s changed too -- just as I was leaving -- [03:00] how they
handled your -- when you asked -- I think that’s for recommendations -- all of that has now
changed -- which is you had your recommendations put on file. And that’s all changed. You
know, people like me put tons of recommendations on file in the plan of looking easily. Now,
they’ve that just to five, which isn’t at good. But they, kind of, tightened the whole ship up,
which is still OK, I think, on the Pembroke campus. And in the -CW: In Pembroke Library.
18

ASL: -- in Pembroke Library. So, I did use that and found what resources they had to be very
good -- especially compared to some other schools. They helped you use what you had to get a
job -- help you sell yourself, how to find -- not find a “fit yourself into a particular cubby hole”,
but what -- trying to sell yourself -- what do I have? Why you would want me to hire me?
Which was great because in the English background -- especially since I wasn’t interesting in
having more teaching or something -- I wanted -- it was kind of on hold for you. When I
graduated, [04:00] I was going out towards Cornell. My husband is involved with his graduate
work there. So, the counseling center helped me a great deal get a job. I wanted a job at Cornell
and in working in a academic advising center. So, they would help platoon me in what I could
put forth in getting a job even though I knew that that wasn’t what I wanted to spend my life
doing, which was very helpful. You know, really just delighted to get Brown studies and,
literally, just like learning. But then when it came time to get a job, that wasn’t what I wanted to
put it towards. So, I could still get a job and in multiple steps (inaudible).
CW: Sounds excellent. When your husband graduated, did you get married at that time?
ASL: I got married after I came back from China and he finished his degree work at -- his
graduate work at Cornell at the time. And we were married that summer. Then, he did another
year at Cornell. So, I was married right -- basically, right out of college.
CW: And that was OK with you -- [05:00] to be engaged through college?
ASL: Yeah. That was fine. That’s becoming less and less common, which is fine also. I mean,
I’m not a kind of typical, conservative person. I’m not that way. I don’t normally follow -- I’m
not an average -- you know, I follow things, but I fell into that normal pattern of getting married
right out of college, which is becoming less and less popular, which I think is absolutely right. I
just happened to fall -- it just happened to work out that way for me. Him coming along -- and
it’s worked out the best because I’ve gotten a lot of things done in co-- in school and, I mean, the
kids and all of that.

19

CW: Was he from Lancaster, too?
ASL: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. I grew up with him. Not childhood sweethearts. No. Childhood
classmates, but not childhood sweethearts. So...
CW: (laughter) That’s funny. Mm-hmm. At Brown or from your raising or anything, did you
have any pressure as to what was an appropriate job for a woman? [06:00]
ASL: Mm-hmm.
CW: Because this is a very unusual job for a woman to have.
ASL: Yeah. Yeah, it is. For men, it’s not -- I should say not pressure so much from my family -from the outside world. Brown was good about that. The problem is, you know, that in academic
environments is they’re usually much more liberal than the real world is. So, you study there and
lots of acceptance and you do well and you think that the world is going to be your oyster. And
we can have rude awakenings. And I always want to be optimistic, but sometimes I need to be a
little more realistic. I went to graduate school. Again, no problem. Doors opened. But when you
say, “become a priest”, there’s a lot of checkpoints. And you are given a lot of academic and it’s
all psychological examinations. And that’s when I really hit out with a lot of discrimination, a lot
of prejudice, about what was appropriate and what wasn’t appropriate. I never got that at Brown.
No, it wasn’t until, maybe, my junior year that I decided to become a priest. [07:00] But, even
then, very accepting of that -- of what I wanted to do. And my family was very accepting of that.
It’s just my husband and friends. It was more from the real world -- outside of graduate school -that I...And also studying -- he said studying English was pretty acceptable. You know two and
two are more of this -- what you do in the hard sciences. In English, I mean, there was always
more women than men in English and music. That’s always kind of seen as more feminine than,
I mean, masculine. So, if I had been in that environment -- in pre-med, in Brown med -- it’s more
-- I’m sure I would have had more. But because I was in music and English, I didn’t experience
that much until I got -- it wasn’t until later in (inaudible) -- become a priest there. There was a
lot of -- not discrimination -- a lot of thinking about, sort of, appropriate. But it became more so
20

as I had children. People thought it was more torture of kids. I mean, what kind of mother is
going to -- [08:00] you know, “How can you go to school, become a priest, and become a
mother? Isn’t that a contradiction?” And, you know, interesting. You know, I took this position
that I have in this church when I was seven months pregnant. And I don’t know if I’ve seen a
pregnant priest before. Not too many people have seen a pregnant priest, but this time, which is
wonderful. So, things are changing. Often, with a position, I wanted to say that, you know, if
they were interested I would tell them over the phone that I was pregnant. I figured for sure that
that would be the end, but I ended up at St. Paul’s right next to Yale. And he said, “Well, we’ll
call when we can.” And I thought either they’re crazy or they’re really, really cool. And they
were a ladder. They were really cool about all of it. This worked out pretty good. But you still
find it -- as I’m sure you see. It’s still subtle. If it’s not there, you’re not catching all of the
vibes. I think that’s really changing. But it will always happen. I came out saying -- people say
that when I wouldn’t have really waited longer, [09:00] they would have gotten -- it’s always a
new battle no matter when it happens. Somebody will have that happen now. Those battles are
inevitable. And they’re just going to you, “Handle them.”
CW: When you decided to be a priest your junior year, did you realize that it was -- I mean, I
supposed that you realized that’s a pretty radical kind of a thing to do.
ASL: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
CW: You did. But it doesn’t faze you at all?
ASL: No, I really felt what we call a calling to do that. If God would have called me to do that,
I’d be supported by my peers and friends to do that. And I knew, at that point, I was being
radically. I guess it is. But I thought it was what I was called to do -- what I wanted to do. There
are women who have been priests because of (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)
CW: For formidable reasons?

21

ASL: Exactly. And that I don’t think is right. But, for me, that wasn’t -- I wasn’t trying to really
contest. I was trying to fulfill part of what I believe I was called to do and who I was. So, it
wasn’t that way for me. And I think I had a very enriching history because of that. It’s not been
[10:00] easy. It’s not been all bad. And friends. And some friends were (inaudible).
CW: After Cornell, is that when you moved to New York?
ASL: Mm-hmm. Right. Exactly. And we were there for five -- almost five years. I began my
graduate work in a seminary in Chelsea and my husband, then, he worked with Arthur Anderson
at that time. And I was three years in seminary, which is the educator program, most of which
was also spent working in the church is what was called theo-education -- an apprenticeship in
education -- in Christian education, which was in my field. And, then, was there almost two
years as an ordained minister before we moved a semester into [Justinfeld?].
CW: And your husband kept his job?
ASL: Yeah. He kept transferring. Actually, he transferred, again, when we were in New York.
[11:00] So, he’s been the one every time that has changed because of me, which has been
wonderful -- a bit unusual at this time. They just told him to do that. (laughter) But they usually
like to say when we move and he tells them, “Well, I leaving you because my wife is leaving
me.” And it’s worked out in the end. He liked Philadelphia. He did not like New York City. So,
it’s been a welcome change.
CW: And you already your kids when you moved to New York?
ASL: Uh, I had one. I had our son and it was in [Routier?] I was seven months pregnant, so the
second time was one. Just...
CW: Do you have friends who live around here?

22

ASL: Yes. I can’t -- now do I have any? I’m saying yes so quickly. No. I don’t think I do have
any Brown friends in this area. I saw someone from Brown the other day at the Brandywine
River Museum -- David Goldstein. [12:00] He was in the choir. I couldn’t believe it.
CW: (laughter)
ASL: [12:00] There are some agrarians in the area, but we’re friends. I have a number of them in
New York, a number of them in the Boston area, some in Chicago, some of the others -Washington. And they kind of went (inaudible).
CW: Did the friends that you made when you were at Brown take as similar radical jobs as yours
or...?
ASL: No. Well, I don’t know anybody else who became a priest. They were into various things.
A number of them are doctors, a number of them are lawyers, and, then, I have one of my friends
who is a couple years ahead of me who just was given a certificate for the teacher most loved by
her students -- she teaches law at DePaul University. So, I would say lawyers, doctors, a couple
went to do graduate work in English, [13:00] engineer, but none else in the religion field. Yeah.
None.
CW: Was there anything else? Anything extremely special about Brown that we haven’t talked
about it all?
ASL: No... (inaudible)
CW: Anything real bad? (laughter)
ASL: Any real bad?
CW: Yeah.

23

ASL: Well, for most people -- why am I -- I just have this amazing picture.
CW: Oh, that’s great!
ASL: I loved -- the teachers were wonderful and I really liked the undergraduate education. You
know, personally, I was -- of course I didn’t have more TAs. [14:00] Yeah, I don’t think I ever
had a TA teacher. Some of the classes weren’t fantastic and some of the teachers took
(inaudible) crying (inaudible). Oh my senior year I was ready not to be on the meal plan, but I
really enjoyed those times in the lab and when my parents it was always really fun. What else?
Well, I always loved commencement and all of the reunions and I haven’t gotten back there
since the fall. (inaudible) But that was always a kind of fun week. Add to that, somehow I
should imagine you do this too now -- orientation week.
CW: Yes.
ASL: Which is al-- you know, people say, a big plus. That was a great week. There was square
dancing in the gym. Oh, yeah. I still remember all of it. And the, you know, every -- [15:00] all
the booths that there are there. Now, that was impressive. And somebody different -- I
remember they had -- do they still have the different, crazy U Nights in the cafeteria?
CW: There’s special meals.
ASL: Yeah, so now that was kind of a fun time. Yeah. And the Latin course service.
CW: Well, you know, Professor [Workman?] just died.
ASL: You know, he was from Lancaster. He lived just down the street from me in Lancaster.
CW: Oh. (laughter)

24

ASL: Now, that was another favorite course was a course I took with [Bruce Donovan?] in
classics. Yeah, I did know he just died. He was very ill. No, he’s from Lancaster. Lived right
down the street. So, I saw him in Lancaster. He was in a mental institution. Sometimes, a little
bit of the red tape in the administrative building wasn’t so hot. Course registration time was not
the best time of year.
CW: It’s also -- it’s kind of unusual to taking incompletes freshman year?
ASL: Taking incompletes? Well, that was a -- we took all of them. (laughter) [16:00] I do not
like taking incompletes, but there was no choice because we finished. You know, we went to
India.
CW: How long was that trip?
ASL: About three and a half weeks. It was pretty exciting. (inaudible) but it was great.
CW: How did that specifically work?
ASL: Well, we broke a little -- you know, the other third week in December. And we took
storybooks home and -- at least I did -- and thought, well, really, I’ve just got no time with
friends and studied -- both better not do it. I got burnt with at least two term papers over the
holidays. And you would come back for reading week and exams. Now, you may have had
classes in January -- may have had some classes in January. I think it was about a week of
reading week and, then, it was a week of exams.
CW: Yeah. Oh, well.
ASL: [17:00] One of the professors, I forgot her name, and she teaches early English Literature.
At [Millton?] there’s just French -- [Lee Barabara?] -- and I wanted to take the exam early so
that I could go to Cornell and [she didn’t let me?]. I did not like her exams. There’s something I
rarely think about now. I just did not like her exams. Much of them were take home, term
25

papers are term papers. I just did not function well in a written exam setting. I just didn’t -- I
mean, I did good -- I did good a writing term papers. (inaudible)
CW: Most English professors have papers.
ASL: Mm-hmm. Which they come in take home (inaudible).
CW: Did you use your writing for anything else -- than [classes?]
ASL: During the summer I would do some articles on, you know, different club tips. [18:00]
You know, the little newspapers (inaudible). I would keep those. (inaudible)
CW: Well, there’s nothing else that’s to say now, I guess.
ASL: Well, this has been great. I mean, you really just took me back on a wonderful way. I
mean, as you can see, I -- that great (inaudible) lasted me not only in terms of my thoughts and
all the money and everything else. I’m just tired. It’s a great place to be. It’s probably a lot
harder to get into now. I think the last time I visited the grounds I thought this must be the
smartest person in the world. I mean, it’s gotten even more competitive since 1970’s -- more
popular, which makes the competition -CW: Right. The hot school.
ASL: (inaudible) So, it was great for me. It was just wonderful.
CW: OK. Thank you. [19:00]
