LH: Okay. I have to say this again to start the tape. This is Leigh Hercher, Brown class of 1991,
interviewing Dorothy Kay Fishbein, Brown class of 1945, May 9, 1988, in her home in
Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Now Dorothy, I was excited to hear you were such a career girl in your
college days. That sounds really unusual that you worked while you were going to school, in the
family business.
DKF: Right.
LH: How did you get involved in, or how early did you start working?
DKF: Well my father died late in my freshman year of college. We lived in Boston at the time,
and I was attending Simmons. And we stayed in Boston for an additional year; so I had
completed two years at Simmons before we came back to Rhode Island because we’re a small
family, and was left of the family was here. And my folks had always wanted to open an infants’
and children’s shop. And, you know, maybe next year, and maybe next year, and maybe next
year, and there were always reasons not to strike out on one’s own.
And so, when we were faced with this situation, my mother said, “Well this is what we
wanted to do and you want to go into retailing,” cause I had hoped to go onto the print school,
which was a graduate program of merchandising at that time. At this point it’s incorporated into
Simmons’ undergraduate program.
LH: I see.
DKF: And so she said, “As long as that’s where you want to go, and we need to do something,
we’ll go back there and do it.” The family were concerned that we would be alone there and
perhaps it would be too difficult. So, we came back and in September of ’41, we opened our
business. In December came the war, and all the merchandise you would be allotted was
predicated on what you had bought from manufacturers in the preceding five years or so. So it
was a bit of a challenge, and I was fortunate, there were elderly men left. All the young men had
gone to war, sadly. And so they took pity on this poor little girl who came in looking for
merchandise and one would call the other, and it was just like a network, that you got a little bit
of merchandise in each of the places, and that’s how you stayed alive. [2:48]
LH: Oh, boy.
DKF: Our original shop probably would have been lost in our kitchen, and… So I went to school
in the morning. I took any classes that came in the morning. By noontime I was headed
downtown because my mother was alone, and if you needed any merchandise, it was on our
other floor in the stockroom, so you’d have to close the door to go and get it. And we worked
until late, 5:30 or so, when business day was over, and then you went home and you started the
next shift. TI did have a year’s lot that I didn’t go to school. The first year we were in business
and I was taking some courses at night. The YM[CA] on Broad Street had some manner of
school. I don’t -- I really don’t remember the name of it. And I started there, and I took

1

advertising, which I felt would be good, would help me. I think I took some form of business
economics. I was there and after the first few sessions I thought, “What am I doing here? I don’t
belong here. I’m lost.” But I started it; I finished it. But in the meantime I applied for a transfer,
and they were very gracious and let me enter. Really, when I finished I don’t think it was many
months before Miss Mooar, who was Dean of Admissions, and Dean Morriss retired. I wore
them out [laughter] getting through school. I don’t really think anybody thought I would make it.
And thank goodness in the last six months, nobody said to me, “Why don’t you give it up? It’s
too much.” Because by then I was exhausted. I took the accelerated course. I’m not sure you
know what that is.
LH: Because of the war?
DKF: People went tri semester -- could, if they wanted to, because of the war. And I did, but I
took part course.
LH: What does that mean, exactly?
DKF: I, only instead of taking -- [5:00] if there were four courses I took two courses per
semester, because I couldn’t cope with a full program and work.
LH: So, was that one every day? One Monday-Wednesday-Friday and one Tuesday-Thursday,
or…
DKF: You know, I really can’t remember what the schedule was. But I just remember going, and
I, it must have been because I used to go to New York between exams and papers, and -LH: To go to market, or?
DKF: Yes.
LH: Oh.
DKF: I went on the train in the morning. I came back at night. I mean, I couldn’t go many places.
There weren’t that many who had merchandise, and somehow I got it done.
LH: That’s amazing.
DKF: Yes, it really was, and in the midst of it all I, was… I developed appendicitis.
LH: [laughter] There’s no time for that!
DKF: For two days in the beginning they didn’t know what was wrong with me. But it was all
right, that was, I went in one midnight, and before anybody came to and realized what was
happening, I was already in recovery and back in my room and all was well. With all these
things, one did manage.

2

LH: That’s incredible.
DKF: Yes, well it was a bit of a challenge, but it was good.
LH: So were you at Brown for two…
DKF: I was there… it took me three years.
LH: Three years.
DKF: Instead of graduating in ’43 had I remained at Simmons, I would have, I was out the year,
and then I needed credits that I didn’t need -- I didn’t need four years of gym at Simmons, and I
didn’t need a science course. And so that’s -- it was October ’45. In those days we had an
autumn …
LH: Graduation?
DKW: Graduation, yes. I could have been either class of ’45 or ’46, and I said, “The one that
gets me out soonest.” [laughter] I mean I was really feeling like, most retarded.
LH: [laughter] that’s terrible.
DKF: [laughing] They would tease and say, “We came and we found you, we left and we left
you. Aren’t you gonna leave, ever?” They thought I was a perpetual student. And so that was it.
But it was-- I had wonderful professors. I had Professor [William] Hastings for Shakespeare, and
I had [George] Anderson for Chaucer. And Randy Stewart, whose keen interest was Hawthorne,
and studying that part of the…my major as you can hear was English and –
LH: Oh, so professor Stewart was, I think I read in ’45 he was elected favorite professor or
something…
DKF: he was yes, and Coolidge also, Arlan Coolidge… music department. And we were, really
quite a strange class, really. We were people who came in as normal freshmen; there were
transfer students like myself. Some people took the conventional two semesters; some people trisemestered. We were all at different points. It was probably my shortcoming, because I don’t
think I had lunch in what you call the Gate now, I don’t think I had it maybe six times in all the
years I was there. And other than art with Downing, I never traversed the Brown campus. I didn’t
even really know what it looked like. [laugher] Everything was in Pembroke Hall, on one floor
or another. And you studied upstairs in the library. In those days you could walk the floors to the
library. Not many years ago, I wanted to borrow some records to hear some music that -- We
were debating if we wanted to go to a particular concert, and they had copies of the music there.
I thought by the time I got to the second floor, and I rested awhile, I really thought I needed that
dog with a brandy to get to the third floor. [laughter] When it came to returning them, my
husband said, “I think I’ll take them up for you.” I couldn’t believe it, of all those years that you
did it so naturally.

3

LH: Right. Without thinking about it.
DKF: Without. And carrying books and all and I could not believe it. It was really funny. [9:30]
LH: So all your classes were in that building?
DKF: Right.
LH: And were they all women?
DKF: All women that I don’t remember any men, that I, there were men, but I wasn’t aware, but
I didn’t know the men who were in the class until postwar years, and reunions, and you began to
see names.
LH: How strange that must have felt.
DKF: Really, I met more of the people who were in my class or at school over the counter in
subsequent years, as they married and became parents, than I knew at school, because I wasn’t
there enough to participate. I didn’t even go to chapel after a while, because I couldn’t afford that
time. I had to be downtown. It was my loss, but the dean was just wonderful, and understanding.
She was reluctant. She knew I was going to be missing a lot of…
LH: Social life?
DKF: College life, yes. Matter of fact, I couldn’t tell you the names of dormitories.
LH: So you did live in dorms then? You didn’t live with your mother?
DKF: People did live in dorms, but I was a day student. I commuted.
LH: Oh, you did?
DKF: There were many of us who were day students, then. It was almost like a continuation of
high school. It was people who came from out of town, I think, more nearly than people who
lived here, but I wouldn’t want to make that as a firm statement, because I don’t really know.
But even the day students, there were rooms that-- social rooms, where you could meet
with one another. I think they learned to play bridge there, day students, just as well as the
people in dorm life. I think they participated in many of the activities because they were there. I
remember one of the girls saying, “I lived in Lincoln. I would go down to North Main Street at
10 o’clock at night, to pick up the bus to go home without a thought in my head that it might be
dangerous.” Because it wasn’t, then. And today, you just wouldn’t do that.
LH: You wouldn’t do it. No.
DKF: You might have questions about Thayer Street at night, waiting for the bus, let alone then.
It’s just the difference in the times.

4

LH: Did you feel that they -- did you feel the effects of the war on your years there, or… Did you
kind of feel kind of oblivious to it, or was it really a reality?
DKF: No, you knew it and you were glad you were busy, because there really wasn’t much
social life. Particularly having been away from the community so many years, I didn’t really get
to know people again. Friendships, cliques, had long since been formed. I left the community
here during the fifth grade and that we moved to Cambridge. That year they were a little short of
money in Cambridge and so the schools closed early. That had to be one of the longest summers
of my life.
LH: Sounds like a dream for a child.
[Unintelligible, both laughing and talking]
DKF: My father went to work for the Enterprise department stores. It was a chain at the time,
and he opened the store for them in Cambridge; he became the manager. And subsequently, we
moved to different areas in Boston because he went from that store, to becoming a buyer, to
becoming a merchandise man, which he was when he died.
So and there were many stores, they opened a store here in Providence, but we didn’t
come back. He worked out of Quincy and we stayed in Cambridge until I finished grammar
school. I didn’t go to a junior high. And then, I went to a high school that was located in
Roxbury, but we lived in an adjoining community, Dorchester, for one year, then went to
Roxbury for the duration of the high school. And then for the two years I was at Simmons, we
were in Brookline.
It’s a question of not moving and not breaking up the school system, as it were. And
again, it was a girl’s high school, and then onto Simmons, which we always called “President
Beatley’s Seminary for Young Ladies.” [laughter] I would take a friend and we would walk from
Brookline over to over the Fenway. There and back again. So we got our exercise. When we
came here, of course, Bessie Rudd said, “You have to take gym.” And I had a bad back at that
point. I had gone off the diving board at camp one summer, and come up too soon or something,
something I did, and a congenital condition that this finally triggered. And she wouldn’t believe
it. She wouldn’t believe any doctor, that I [laughter] They corrected [inaudible] but you had to
take gym -LH: Was it every day, that you had gym, or every other day, or … [15:00]
DKF: We didn’t have it, I think more than once a week, really.
LH: This was at Simmons.
DKF: No, at Pembroke.
LH: At Pembroke.

5

DKF: At Simmons, I only had it freshman year. So that was it. See it was things like this that
made differences in the times.
LH: Yeah.
DKF: She was the bane of many a person’s existence. Probably the only unpleasant experience I
really had at there. [laughter] It’s a wonderful school. You were never a number there. You
always knew the professors... the administration was aware you were there… anyone you took
courses with, you got to know. If you didn’t take courses with them, I didn’t meet them, because
I wasn’t socializing, at lunch and all… and they were getting younger, and I was getting older.
[laughter] Because they went through what I sort of lived through and crawled through. It was -but I wouldn’t have passed it up. It was something I wanted, and I was glad to have it. Never
regretted it.
LH: Well, did you know that from such an early age that you wanted to be in the retail business
then?
DKF: It was during high school because I thought I might like to be a teacher.
LH: That was quite common for women I guess.
DKF: Right. I really don’t know what happened in my freshman year but I made a brave
decision: I didn’t want to be a teacher. And that was it. And I definitely couldn’t do social work.
I was much too emotional. I couldn’t do it. Though I must say, in the era just preceding my
graduation, and even people in my classes, I think if they took music courses they came out and
did social work. You didn’t need the masters. Nobody stopped you from getting it, but you could
get a job without it in social work at that time.
And as a matter of fact, during my freshman year there at Simmons,and when I thought,
“Well I want to do it anyhow,” and we were going to open the business, I had thought I would
transfer to Chamberlin. It’s a school in Boston that is a more technical type of retailing, training.
And so I went for an interview, and the woman looked at me and she said, “My dear, you better
something else to do, you’re much too short to be a buyer.” [17:45]
LH: Oh!
DKF: Thirty-two years later, I thought to myself, “You were probably right, lady.” I was
probably missing something, but the height wasn’t it. Oh, but that day.
LH: Bad day –
DKF: I tell you, it was really…. There wasn’t anything else I wanted to do. And I tell you, I was
looking for a bridge that day. [laughter] And so, as I say, we went into business, and came back
here, and life went on.
LH: Where you the first female to go to school in your family, or had your mom gone to college?

6

DKF: No, my mother didn’t go to college. High school. My father was college of pharmacy. He
was a pharmacist, and there, he worked for a concern called Liggett’s. It was a chain of
drugstores that I’m not even exists anymore, anywhere, but it isn’t here for sure. And then they
bought a drugstore in Pawtuxet, I’m not sure you know where that is. Do you have you ever
heard the term “Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet?”
LH: No.
DKF: All right, well it was this great big ballroom. And also, outside, it was adjacent to a body
of water, and in my parents’ time there were rowboats and canoes, and it was a point of social
existence.
It was the drugstore was down right near the falls, the Pawtuxet Falls, and they were there
for…I don’t know how long they actually had it, but at the point that I was five years old, we
came to the city, and I know that because I had my tonsils out that August. That was my fifth
birthday present.
And it was a very, very difficult life. And that was the time…that Prohibition started.
And my father said, “I didn’t struggle to go to school to be a pharmacist to be a bootlegger.” And
so they sold the business. [20:00] And I had an uncle who had a store in Pawtucket, a retail store.
It was clothing for all the family. And he said, “You know, this business is growing and I really
need somebody with me, and since you’re leaving the drugstore, why don’t you come in and
learn this business?” And he was a young man, in his 30s, and he hadn’t…..My father was with
him about six months and he had a stroke.
LH: Oh, goodness.
DKF: In those days, a very serious matter. It’s not, a light thing today, but they didn’t have the
medications and the know how then. And so my father had to take over and run the business,
which he did for many years, all through my uncle’s lifetime and… I shouldn’t say that. He was
still living, but my aunt decided to sell the business. She had a brother-in-law on the other side of
the family, who decided that was silly, for her to be having that responsibility. She didn’t have,
because she never went into the store. My father was running it. But he had some other thoughts
in his mind, and so he saw a chance to take advantage of it, and did it. And that’s how we
happened to go to Boston. My father went to work for the Enterprise. And so, there we were.
LH: Let’s see, what were your first impressions of Pembroke your freshman year --or not your
freshman year, but when you…
DKF: When I transferred?
LH: Yeah.
DKF: You know, I really went in, I looked at that question, and I thought, “I can’t remember.” I
had two cousins who had attended Pembroke. My cousin Jean Miller who graduated in ’39 -- this
was the maternal side of the family. Phi Beta Kappa. She was the keeper of the family brains.
[laughter] And then I had another cousin on my father’s side of the family, who had two years at
Pembroke [background car noise] and then transferred to Simmons. She just did the reverse [of

7

me]. I think it was that it, a desire to live, try someplace that wasn’t just Providence. Having been
born and bred, she needed to go away.
Matter of fact it was funny, we both decided that we wanted to go to the University of
Michigan before we started college. She was a year ahead of me. I can’t tell you any reason in
the world why we suddenly decided why we wanted to go to the University of Michigan. I can’t
tell you anything about it. I don’t know more today then I knew then.
LH: Just got that in your head…
DKF: It just sounded like some place, like a place… [laughter] But we had been going to camp
and I’m an only child and my family didn’t want me to go that far, and I guess at that point her
mother didn’t want it either, and so she ended up at Pembroke and I at Simmons because we
lived in the particular communities, and then reversed. So I really, I went, I liked it, I felt
welcome, they were wonderful people, but I can’t really tell you any of the type of feelings that
you’re mentioning. I didn’t stay around long enough to absorb the ambiance of it, really.
LH: Well did you have a chance to participate in the social events, like the Masque day or the
sophomore -DKF: I don’t remember any of those things -LH: Or Ivy Day [24:00]
DKF: No, I don’t think I remember any of it. In fact, I didn’t get back to campus until my first
reunion, once I left. I just was so absorbed…
LH: Yeah, in the store…. I think I saw I think a couple of years prior to your yearbook, the it
said “For Ivy Day and night, a tradition we must forsake,” and I wondered if a lot of these things
were discontinued because of the war.
DKF: They may have been. I can’t answer you. I could find out.
LH: Well, I can probably find out.
DKF: Lois Colinan would know because Lois was there full time.
LH: I just wondered if it was pretty sparse for social events once the war…
DKF: Well, yeah. It really was. Somehow or other, it was you had, you went and you had
something to do and to accomplish, and it was a great time. Some people, I think, had been
dating young men, and they went to war, and this was the way they filled their time preparing...
against the time they would come home. It was very difficult, when these young men came
home. The years they would have been studying, and preparing for career, they just missed that
time. They either were interrupted in the course of their undergraduate work, or, if they were
going on to a profession, they definitely got to that. And, so…

8

LH: Nipped in the bud.
DKF: You know, it was. Life was just on hold, as nearly as I can tell. Maybe it was my own
existence.
LH: Did you feel -- your career choice wasn’t influenced by the war, was it? I mean, you knew
before you entered…
DKF: Oh, I knew what I wanted to do, yes. When I went to Pembroke, it was because I felt halfbaked. I’d had two years, and I wanted the rest of it. I wanted my degree. I wanted that sense of
accomplishment.
LH: You must have been very driven to keep at it.
DKF: I guess, to do it. And English. I always liked to read. I always liked books so and I
couldn’t get any retailing background there, because neither Brown nor Pembroke were geared to
that in those days. It’s only in recent years that they give accounting courses, I think so that the
kids can go out, all of you, and at least have something concrete to offer an employer. But we
were strictly liberal arts then. And I never expected to ever want to use it for a livelihood, so I
was delighted to luxuriate in all these English courses. I’m sure I should have gone on to a
master’s but I couldn’t have gone back and taken another course if my life had depended upon it.
I was spent. Also, when people came back… When we started, and it was during the war, there
were maybe two or three stores downtown. I’m not sure you’ve ever been downtown?
LH: I have.
DKF: Okay.
LH: Oh, Pawtucket?
DKF: No, in Providence.
LH: In Providence.
DKF: We lived in Providence at the time, on Waterman Street. What they call Westminster Mall
was just Westminster Street at that time. There’s a building on the left called the Alice Building.
When you get off the bus, you’re at Dorrance Street, crossing Westminster. If you continue up
Westminster, on the left-hand side, before you get to Tilden-Thurbers. This building was on it,
and we were upstairs in the back of the building, and people never could have told you the name
of the shop. [laughter] They just knew in the third floor in the Alice building, in the back, there
was a…
LH: A children’s shop.
DKF: Yeah. And that was it. And it was a luncheonette on the same floor, so that created a good
deal of traffic. There were, active alterationists. There were milliners in those days in there, and

9

podiatrists, and so it was an active floor and that brought people up. And if the elevators were
slow, they walked the two flights up metal stairs. And then they stood out in the hallway until
there was an opening to get into this little store! [laughter]
LH: Was it really tiny?
DKF: It was really tiny. We had a counter that was not much longer for us than that loveseat. If
you had a package you got down on all fours to do it, because there was merchandise on the
counter, so you didn’t have the space to do it. But people were very forgiving. We had-- those
were days of honest people. We had a cupcake tin that we put into a little drawer and that held
different amounts of change, the different denominations. People would go in and make their
own change if we were busy. [29:30]
LH: Wow.
DKF: You could do it then.
LH: Yeah.
DKF: But we came after the war, we had lost the -- there were adjoining buildings that the
stockroom was in, and buildings were sold. We were losing our stockrooms. So we had to come
move, and that’s how we came next to Wayland Square. Matter of fact, my husband -- I was
married, had been married in ’47 -- and in ’49 we moved to the square, and we kept the other
store for a little while just so people became accustomed to the transfer. But without a
stockroom, it just didn’t work because you couldn’t have enough of the right things there. It
looked like we were always taking everything over there and didn’t care about the people who
were shopping downtown, so it was better to go across. And most everybody ultimately came
across.
LH: Well, did your husband go into that business with you then?
DKF: He didn’t, then. He, matter of fact, he, using his GI bill, he went to Bryant. He…went to
Brown, because his family wanted to be -- he had a brother who was a doctor and this brother
was almost like a father to him. My husband is one of eight, and he’s next to the youngest and
this other one was next to the oldest, so it was a different type of relationship. And he hated it.
And didn’t want to do it. And he wanted to go to Wharton, because he liked figures and business.
And they said, “Oh, if you want to go into business, you don’t have to have an education,
you open the door and that’s it.” Anyhow, he just didn’t fight them enough to go and do it. And
so when he came back, after the war, and he decided he was too old to go to Wharton, and so he
went to Bryant, and he got what he could out of it. He needed a course to accounting [?] because
another brother was in store fixtures, building the counters and drawers so forth, that you use in
the business, and they needed someone in that business, the family, who understood dollars and
cents. This other brother was really a magnificent workman, but he had no dollars and cents…
LH: Sense.

10

DKF: Sense. [laughter]
- End of Track 1- Start of Track 2 DKF: …accounting and then, it was constant conflict. So he left that, and he eventually came
into our business, and developed a magnificent inventory control system, which is the core of a
business. It gives you the control to know whether you’re buying enough of something, or too
much, so that you can try to stay in business and have a profit.
LH: Yeah.
DKF: This was not my cup of tea at all. [laughter] It was just lovely. I had to have it, but we
managed to get through one way or another. So we were in the location at the square for about
six or seven years, and then a larger store became available and we moved into that. So, it was 32
years before we closed shop.
LH: Boy, that’s a long time.
DKF: It was, yeah. Then it became larger, and it was just a matter seven days and eight nights. It
consumed your entire life… but it was great. I loved it, the challenge.
LH: Did you all meet at Brown? Or..
DKF: My husband and I? No, we didn’t meet until after the war. And by then, people were back
and picking up the threads of their lives. Some people who’d been dating married because I think
by the time the boys went to war, they were thinking of becoming engaged. I’m not sure when
they came back, they just didn’t know anything else to do. It just seemed, it just something that,
maybe it wasn’t an entrapment [?], I’m not sure that they were ready. Some of them really…
they were terribly shaken by the experience at war, and life took its toll of them. Until people got
back, and on their feet again, and could begin to have some sort of a lifestyle. It really was.
[2:18]
LH: Yeah.
DKF: Yeah.
LH: [clinking glasses; pause] Are there things that you remember, like from -- silly things, that
as a woman, that you remember that are so different now? Like, in the rules and regulations and
what you were -- what was expected of you as a student at Brown?
DKF: Well you know, just as, as an instance… Well as far as studies are concerned, they were,
we were all women in the class. I really don’t think I remember seeing any of the boys there. So
you went along. It was almost an extension of a high school. You had assignments, and you
followed through. The, I will say, it was excitement because each of these professors I had in

11

English, this was their strength. And the love they had of the, Shakespeare, say. He had a modern
sense of humor, this Hastings. He would stand there readings parts of it, many times with tongue
in cheek, and he was enjoying it, and because of, it was contagious, his enjoyment…. created
your enjoyment, and understanding of it. Even as Anderson was, this was his keen interest,
Chaucer.
I’m not sure I could go beyond “The Wife of Bath’s.” But at the time, it was, you would,
just submerge in that particular time, when you were in that course. Bringing you everything that
was part of that period. And again, with Stewart when it came to the Hawthrone, because this
was -- he did a lot of studies and wrote books on it. This was his complete absorption,
Hawthorne. And so as I said, these English that made the greatest impression. [5:01]
I had a Professor [Charles] Smiley for astronomy. Poor man, how we struggled with him.
[laughter] Great sense of humor, wonderful human being, I just don’t have an affinity for
science. But it was the least obnoxious of any of the science courses that I can think of.
[laughter] I remember having to dissect the frog at camp in the summer, and that turned me off
completely. That was the end of my science. [laughter]
I’m trying to remember courses. But I really couldn’t tell you. These were the ones that
made the greatest impression on me.
LH: Yeah. Well, did you then, did, you had a curriculum requirement?
DKF: Oh, yes. Yeah, we did then, yes. It was not the era of the New Curriculum. And we didn’t
question it. This is what was required. This is what we did. [some cross talk] I think I did some
Spanish, there, because I think you had to have a language, and I… whatever I’d had to do
with… I did at Simmons, and so forth. And I can’t remember the others, and I don’t even know
that I have such as thing as a sort of report. At year’s end, any of these things. I certainly don’t
have a catalog from those days. To know…
LH: Did working at the store help to pay your tuition?
DKF: Well, I guess it did. I never really thought of it that way, when my mother just wrote a
check and that was it. That was the era when it cost you $500 for the semester. Not like now.
LH: Wow. 500.
DLF: And to pay for books, and we were able to get hand-me-down gym outfits, and it was
really fairly cut in dry, I guess, in relation. We didn’t do the extra volunteer work. If we did, I
didn’t know about it, because I certainly didn’t do it.
LH: For the war, you mean?
DKF: For the war. Or, I mean, so many of you on campus today work in the community in
different projects, which is wonderful. I don’t remember anything about this, and if I did, as I
say, I was so absorbed that I certainly didn’t have the time to do it.
LH: I read some --

12

DKF: I think probably, most of these girls went, like, went on to become housewives and
mothers, and it was a very conventional lifestyle. Matter of fact, if you were to see the pictures of
our reunions, you would find that really until -- this ’85, our last reunion -- up until that point, we
kept getting younger. Clothes were worn shorter, hairstyles were shorter, and we were much
more vital. We were really, ’47 were the longer lengths. We were a very dowdy group. [laughter]
Really sad sacks. And as I say, it was a complete, renovation as we went on You could see age in
’85. This was the first time that you could know that people were getting older.
LH: That’s a good record, then.
DKF: Yes, it really is. Well, you know these gals were busy. They had children, and, they were
chauffeurs, because, you know, kids were going in all sorts of directions. Some of them were in
private schools, some in public schools. But they were -- they were absorbed doing all these
things, because men were tied hand and foot to whatever their careers were.
A few people did do -- go onto careers. Fannie Gibson [?] certainly did. Betty Horenstein
did. I’m trying to think of some of the others. They became very successful people. They…
made a difference in the world. They published, or they were acknowledged in their particular
careers. People who really made their marks, as it were. But, for the most part, some people
married very successfully, and they’ve been most generous to the school and to the class. You
know, in giving to the university.
LH: Were you unusual, that you worked after you were married?
DKF: I think a few of us did. Not many. Most of them were, as I say, were housewives, and they
worked very hard. As housewives, as mothers. They really did. They were active at school, or
they still talk and I never went to one of…. If I could go to bridge… I was in tough shape, as far
as business was concerned. [laughter] It was too busy a day, but they, they ran bridges and they
had white elephant sales in connection with it, uh, I’d have to refer you to somebody else,
because I was, I never participated. [10:52]
LH: Well, that’s fine. I just wanted to know, about what you -DKF: They just go back to it, they keep talking about it, but in those days, the people who
worked on campus, the maintenance people, they just did these things. But since they’ve become
unionized they can’t afford to do it, because the cost is so high… being paid by the hour…
setting up tables and chairs, and dismantling and all. So there’s a lot of things that we don’t do. I
think, I don’t know how you feel as an undergraduate, but I think that there was a camaraderie, a
closeness, a sisterhood. I’m sure I had a sophomore or a junior sister. I can’t think who it was at
the time. But they were there.
You have other means of guidance, on a student level. But I think that as young women,
you miss this sort of camaraderie that we had there, because you’re not in the school. It was all,
we were all really, or certainly the greater part of us, horrified and really hurt when the schools
were merged. We could understand the administrations merging. That was the dollar-and-cents
decision.
But when they took away Pembroke, I think the women lost their identity. Career Development
will tell you that when you walk in and afterwards, and you get your degree, and you say, “I

13

gradated from Brown,” the ears go up. They’re interested. If you say you graduated from
Pembroke, there, even in earlier years, there perhaps wouldn’t have been as great an impression.
Our degrees, say-LH: Brown-DKF: A Brown degree. Even though we…
LH: Did that make you mad? Or…
DKF: No, we didn’t -- we knew we were a school within a school, but we had a separate identity.
And there was a strength. The -- when Wheaton -- the alums were up in arms about and many of
the undergrads, they went to Wheaton for that reason. They gained strength from one another.
They developed their own networks as undergraduates that probably continued. This need for a
networking is an indication. You have no way of combating the old boy routine. And when
people are being interviewed at the Hope Club or the University Club, you have to know that you
are still not equal. [14:00] You may be together, but you’re not equal. And I think that this is
something, that you don’t have, that we had.
LH: You felt more…
DKF: Of a whole.
LH: An equality within that whole? I mean, equality -DKF: I think you were equal among equals, yes. Some people were infinitely much brighter than
others. People’s personalities were perhaps more attractive to one rather than the other, but you
didn’t have the feeling of low man. You probably didn’t have that many courses. Some of them
may have had more if they were economics or history [majors], they may have been on the
Brown campus more, whether…. and it was the war years and so they may not have felt that the
professors called on the men more than the women. Because there was a dearth of men then. So I
can’t speak for them, because I wasn’t a part of that experience. At Pembroke, they were talking
to women, so it was one it was one or the other that they were talking with.
LH: I read a story in the yearbook, one of the yearbooks, that a professor would -- in a class that
was mostly male, before the war, during the war, he would come in and say, “Oh, we have some
guests with us today,” referring to the women.
DKF: Yup.
LH: And I guess he said that every day.
DKF: Yeah.
LH: He couldn’t get used to the fact that --

14

DKF: Yeah, it must have really been very upsetting for these women, who were there and trying
to -LH: Really.
DKF: Fighting for identity. I have no question of it.
LH: But in that case, then, Pembroke didn’t really make it -- do you think it made it easier for
them, then?
DKF: When they had courses, that were more nearly women’s courses, or more nearly attended
by women, I say, the most of them were, I think it was easier, yes. They were not fighting for
recognition.
And a competition that exists among women, particularly in those days, I don’t think it
was a life and death type of competition. That sort of fight didn’t start, ‘til post war. I can tell the
difference because when we first went into business, I was not very tall, and I certainly was
never a prepossessing figure. With not very high heels, and a kidskin coat, and so forth. I’m sure
they had to feel kind of sad for me when I walked in. When they would tell me which at first
they didn’t have anything, I would really believe them. And then I came to find out the hard way
that that wasn’t true. And when you have to fight for existence in a man’s world, it takes its toll.
It is very difficult to remain utterly feminine in that kind of existence. You fight fire with fire. It
would be later where people would say, “Can’t you ever say yes?” when they were showing me
merchandise and I didn’t like it. “Did your mother ever teach you to say yes?” You know. And I
would say to them, “You made me what I am.” You become the product of your experiences.
[17:54]
LH: That’s very true.
DKF: And this is what happens to these girls now, as they fight. You would probably hear more
about it from women who early on chose to become doctors. Or lawyers. I don’t think there were
many dentists, women dentists, at that time. I think its more of a postwar development – a postWorld-War-II development. I’m not really certain.
LH: Well when you say that you felt you had to give up being completely feminine. Did that
bother you? Or…
DKF: I was just very busy. Our business was never a hobby. It was a necessity. It was income.
And I was just gung-ho absorbed in it. And I just didn’t stop to analyze it. But in retrospect, you
hassle along and you’re fighting for taxi, and you’re fighting to get out of the elevator, and you
get into this…. When you get into New York, you sense the tempo picking up immediately. But
when you worked, you are east of 5th Avenue, it’s one sort of life. And when you are west of 5th
Avenue, it’s another.
You’re fighting in between what, I’m trying to remember -- I think we used to call them
th
the “7 Avenue jaguars” -- what they were talking with the racks of clothes being pushed
through the streets. And you had as good a chance of having somebody bump into you, and
perhaps break your leg and knock you down [laughter] as you had of getting to your destination

15

unharmed. You were in buses that were mobbed. The last probably six or eight years, I didn’t go
near a subway. I simply stayed on the surface. It was safer to be fighting along for a place on a
bus than to get involved in the subway. You were rushing because you went with as long a list as
telephone calls, trying to track down deliveries, as in actually going into showrooms to look at
new merchandise.
LH: And you went alone to New York? [20:25]
DKF: If we were buying, many times, my mother went with me because at that point we had
more help. And also my husband was there. But if I were checking, primarily I would go myself.
Particularly in last years, because it was getting to be strenuous for her. I mean, it’s just too
exhausting. I mean, you took a cab to go to the hotel once you got into the city. You took a cab
to go from the hotel back to the station to check through your bags so that when you left at the
end of the day, all you needed to do was get you to the station. That was enough to worry about.
Traffic had become impossible, even then, in the late ‘60s early 70s’. At least yourself, it, worst
came to worst, you could walk it. Because by then you were on the west side, because it was
Penn Station. You weren’t using Grand Central. It was in the early years.
So, as I say it was just running, running, running, running. It was a tenseness all the time.
And there were never enough hours.
LH: Would you have done it-- If you had chosen another career, what would it have been? Do
you have any idea, or did you ever have a thought?
DKF: I just don’t think there was anything else I ever wanted to do. I don’t think I really had the
ability to write. That is, for an income. I wrote an article once for a trade paper. I think I got a
five-dollar bill, which I think still keep wrapped up in the drawer. [laughter]
LH: You just couldn’t spend it!
DKF: But it was, it was that kind of thing. I did the advertising, I did the copy. I didn’t to the
artwork. Many times, standing up as she was sitting there sketching, I would [inaudible] copy.
But you were a jack-of-all-trades when it’s your own.
You go and do it and it has to be. I spent a great deal of time on the selling floor. More
than really people do. Men don’t necessarily spend that much time on the selling floor. In a
business like that, there weren’t too many things they could do. If it was boys’ wear, yes, but
they wouldn’t be selling girls’ wear. And once you start out that way, there’s such a highly
personalized business, it’s very difficult to step back and have people accept employees. It takes
a long time to differentiate between the fixtures and the employees.
They eventually, if they work with them and the girl was pleasant, understood what they
wanted, through time, they worked up relationships. As, as the business grew and people came in
who didn’t know me from a hole in the wall, they automatically went to a salesgirl and
developed a working relationship with that salesgirl.
But still you were there. It’s very difficult, and it’s one of the reasons you find it so
difficult to shop today. You can’t sit in an office reading reports and know what the customers
look like or what they really buy. You don’t know whether they bought it because they had no
choice, that’s all that was available, or they bought it because they loved it and really wanted it.

16

And at this point there really isn’t anyone to tell them. Because those people who go in for four
hours at a time couldn’t care less. Why should they?
LH: Yup. So that contact was really…
DKF: The contact is missing, and it’s a very important one.
LH: Especially in the children’s business, I mean….
DKF: That’s right. People had no idea what to buy. And that’s what they buy. Nobody knows. I
think that probably you and your peers get along better shopping today, because you don’t know
particularly what it is to be worried about. And you’re accustomed to in and going through
racks…
LH: Yourself.
DKF: Yeah. And when I see those racks upon racks upon racks of clothes, I walk out because I
get so upset. I get so confused.
LH: You can’t see anymore -DKF: You can’t! You can’t the forest from the trees. There’s no pattern. I went into Jordan’s
recently with the booklet that had come out, to the page showing exactly what I wanted, and I
came out empty-handed ‘cause nobody could find it. Apparently they decided, “I don’t think it’s
come in yet. Maybe it wasn’t delivered to us.” [25:30]
LH: They had no idea what they were selling.
DKF: No, no idea.
LH: That must be frustrating when you understand the business.
DKF: It is very frustrating. My idea -- I say, there isn’t even a body here, let alone a salesperson.
I haven’t met a salesperson, a real sales person, in years. Except for the man I met recently in
Taymor Shoes. He was the assistant manager. He was the first one in years I have met.
LH: Yeah. So it’s a real art.
DKF: Yes it is, it’s caring enough about people to listen to hear what they say, and to try to find
for them what they need instead of selling them what you’ve got.
LH: It’s more of a pride in your business… personal pride.
DKF: Yes.

17

DKF: Yes, people didn’t know why their children always had something ready to wear. They
just knew that they had it. They just knew that if they came in they wouldn’t go out emptyhanded. That we would find the answer. Because you color coordinated it for them. You mixed
and matched so they could always assemble and reassemble. You listened to how they lived, and
you sold it accordingly.
LH: A psychologist, kind of.
DKF: Here and there, you sold somebody something, because they didn’t really think they
wanted it, but nothing you ever sold them was wrong. So even if they didn’t know that they
wanted this, there must be a reason, and ultimately they came back and said, “You know, you
were right. That was the perfect solution.” It was this sort of working relationship…
LH: You should open a school.
DKF: Yes, yes.
LH: To re-instill that in people. Let me see, what else I wanted to ask you… Oh, about your -going back to school, about your graduation ceremony. Did you go through the gates with boys,
or -DKF: Yes, we did walk down the hill. Matter of fact, I walked down with a girl that I don’t know
that I knew her very well before, and I’ve never laid eyes on her since. [laughter] I think she
probably doesn’t live in this community. She’s never come back to a Commencement that, or to
a reunion, that I’m aware of.
LH: Did you go through the gates with the boys, or were you after the boys?
DKF: I remember walking with this girl. I can’t tell you if there were any. I can’t remember. I
was just so glad I had really gotten to this point. [laughter] It was small because we were all in
the First Baptist reading hall, and you know you can’t do that today. Our class, we only got
maybe about a third, who pay dues, who come back to reunions, and attrition has taken its toll.
We are probably about 178 people in our class.
LH: Oh that’s -DKF: And you know you have a lot more women in your -- 1300 or 1400 students who are
admitted.
LH: Well I guess a lot of them have just most so far away that they…
DKF They have -- they’re on other coasts. Some, many, have retired to Florida. There’s
somebody out in Colorado. We had a letter from her, inviting us to stop there any time we came
out that way. I’m sorry, I have to find it. It’s unbelievable when she talks about what it’s like
there. And we city girls listened as one of us read the letter. We just couldn’t visualize it. We
have a lot to learn.

18

LH: Does she live in the mountains, or -DKF: Out in the country somewhere miles from nowhere. And she raved about how it was was
wonderful. It was she and her husband, something they always wanted to do. I’ll tell you, they
would have me in a straight jacket in 24 hours. [laughter]
LH: You’re just a city girl.
DKF: I’m a city girl. I really am. [laughter] My husband says… [laughter; inaudible]
LH: Let’s see….
DKF: I don’t know where you live, city or country, but -- [30:00]
LH: Well, I’m from Kansas. From Wichita, Kansas. I’m mostly a city girl, but I really like the
country too. I think it’s really, very relaxing.
DKF: It probably is, yes. This is about as country as I care to have.
LH: With your vegetables out in the garden.
DKF: Yeah. When we first moved here, the mailboxes had a divider in them: in town/out of
town. After living near Wayland Square for 15 years, I don’t mind telling you, it was a traumatic
experience. I really couldn’t get over it. Now you just put your mail in the mailbox, but [then]
Providence was out of town, and here we were about four streets from the city line. [laughter] I
had to get back to driving. I didn’t drive for years because I was so tired from working and had
no occasion to. But I’ll tell you, this, this place drove me to it. There actually is a bus right at the
foot of the street. And I thought, “Oh I don’t want to drive again. I’m going to have to go back to
find me an apartment, and live on Angell Street or something. I can’t stand this. I’m too far from
home base!” [laughter]
LH: That’s funny. How did your marriage, affect the feeling you had of yourself, or your
independence? Did you -- being such a career woman, did you feel that marriage changed your…
how you thought about yourself in society?
DKF: Not really, I think because we were all absorbed with this, my mother, my husband ,and I.
LH: Was he in the business before you got married?
DKF: No. Matter of fact, it was a few years afterwards that he ultimately came into the business.
We had a very -- it was a very unique relationship.
- End of Track 2 - Start of Track 3 -

19

DKF: -- if we had had children, my husband and I. Because, we worked together, we were on
vacation together, we lived together. Matter of fact he was lucky, because his mother-in-law
cooked for him. My first meal was a disaster. [laughter] So I told him I wouldn’t cook for him, I
wouldn’t boil water for him. And I really didn’t cook until my mother became gravely ill, and I
didn’t any choice then. And this was 25 years later, and as he said, “My stomach should’ve been
25 years younger when you were experimenting!” [laughter] As I say, he was very grateful for
his mother-in-law. It got to the point we were all on one bank account. It was just really a very
unusual relationship.
LH: Yeah.
DKF: We were all very grateful for it. It was a closeness. Because he was so young, in his run of
brothers, his parents were older people when he was born. And I think that this was a very
special feeling for him, having -- I mean, she was slight, she was vital, she was quick. They’re
both quick, and thorough. My husband also moved like that. They kind of pulled me along with
them. And I’m the wooden leg on the March of Time, I’m the slowpoke. And so they,
understood, and they worked in rhythm, and it was really something.
LH: They probably fed off each other.
DKF: Yeah, right. Exactly. So that they could do it.
LH: That’s really neat.
DKF: But it wouldn’t have been great. It would not have been as easy, and I knew that I was
going to be active in the business. He really liked the buying, and he liked the behind-the-scenes,
and did a fantastic job. And that’s no way to have a family.
LH: When you’re both so involved.
DKF: Yes, if you’re going to have a family, it should be because you wanted children and
because you’re ready to give time to them and enjoy them. It’s not décor in the living room.
LH: Or a dog you put in your backyard.
DKF: Right! We haven’t ever even done that because we…
LH: Were so busy.
DKF: We wouldn’t leave an animal locked up all day. We just wouldn’t do it. I mean, today it’s
different. There are people, even then, who did it, and they thought they could swing it. But I
will never forget the day, a woman I met in one of the business offices across the line. I had met
her many times before, and she was talking to children, I think they were teens at that point, and
it was all a complication of a business and teenage children. And I guess she probably had a
mother who was living with them, so somebody was on the spot, and she said, “You know, I’m

20

first finding out how much my children need me.” And I said, “Oh God, woman, you had to wait
‘til your children were 15 or so to find out that your children needed you.”
LH: Yeah.
DKF: But you see? This is what happened with the war. Some of these women that were buyers
in stores, and many of these boys came back, they’d had no career of any kind before they went
into service… Maybe they were married during the war, before they went in. Maybe they were
married afterwards. But they didn’t even know what to do. And everybody figured out, “Well,
people are going have children, and everybody dresses children, so let’s open a children’s store.”
[laughter] I mean, at one point after the war, there were 18 children’s stores in this -- between
Pawtucket and Providence. And if you’ve been here long enough you know…
LH: That’s not a big part!
DKF: It’s like one community. And Warwick. And one by one, they disappeared. [4:19] At the
time that we went out of business, there were two children’s stores. We were at the square and
there was one on Hope Street. And that’s all the children’s shops there were in the immediate
area. Now there may have been something in suburbia, to somewhere. But, that’s all there were,
of the 18.
LH: Well, so, I forgot what I was going to ask you, while you were talking. Ah well… [pause]
How has your education at Brown affected your life since you, looking back from-DKF: Well I think it was one of the highlights. I wouldn’t have forgone it for anything in the
world, no matter what it took. And I get back. I haven’t the last couple years, but the Pembroke
Club of Providence, they run seminars. They’re five sessions, in the fall and in the spring. And
we have the joyful experience of calling upon the faculty. Sometimes, it’s somebody from off
campus. But it helps. I wouldn’t want to have to take an exam out of the strength of anything,
that I had absorbed in the classroom. But it does update you, and people talk of current
happenings, things that have changed. At least, you know what they’re -- you have some
semblance of what they’re talking about. You have a bit of the jargon, you have a bit of the
outline of what it represents. There’s so many fields that didn’t exist while we were in school,
that have only come into being in the last five or 10 years, even. There are courses that were
unknown, the courses that were simply unknown then. And if we didn’t have this, it would be
this terrible vacuum.
I mean, I’m more inclined to listen to Channel 2 or these, or WCRV, when I have the
radio on. I couldn’t tell you any about the rock groups or the music where I would’ve listened to
popular tunes in my own period of the big bands and all. But we would be in that same gap, if
we, if I hadn’t had these forums. I mean, semiotics is just one instance. Linguistics. My husband
and I are pretty faithful about attending seminars. The Commencement forums, I’m trying to say.
We very often take advantage of speakers on campus, in between times. If I hadn’t gone to
school, I would never think to do it as just a member of the community. Although it’s open to the
public. [7:47]
LH: Because you feel involved.

21

DKF: I feel the closeness and the involvement, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to update and
to stay, and to hope to stay abreast.
LH: Well that’s interesting.
DKF: Yeah, I think this is one of the great pluses of living in a university community.
LH: Especially your university.
DKF: Right. And any one, actually, except the people don’t realize it. I’m sure people in
Cambridge could go many times to things at Harvard that are open to the public. They’re not
always aware of them. They may not catch it in the newspaper, but that’s why you’re there. The
museums, the …
LH: The culture, yeah.
DKF: The culture that’s there, yeah. And I would miss it. We were -- the, American Jewish
Historical Society had a meeting just a week or so ago. And this is where they met. We have a
Rhode Island Jewish Historical Society as well, a very well recognized group. We had a meeting
at John Carter Brown. One of the lectures was there. There was somebody from campus who was
supposed to speak to us, and somebody apparently came from Brazil, and unfortunately, her
husband was there, and she was throwing things into a bag, ready to dash back to Brazil because
her husband had taken ill. They met, they went down in the Biltmore, they had a couple different
sessions here. They were housed at the Biltmore. They went to Newport on Sunday morning, to
tour and speak there. We’ve been down to the War College, it’s all a sort of thing.
LH: You’re still involved.
DKF: Yes, be involved. And that I feel very close to. Matter of fact, I’m President of my class.
LH: As an alumna.
DKF: Yes, the women of ’45. [10:00] And I enjoy the give and take of being off campus.
LH: That’s nice.
DKF: If I had the ability, and if I had been a real student, I think I might have gone back, just
because. Just because of the studies …
LH: For graduate school, or…
DKF: I don’t know that I would’ve gone for credits, or maybe just an audit. Just to get the
vitality of it, keeping the mind alert. I couldn’t actually have taken a course, because I developed
carpal tunnel syndrome, and I had both hands operated on. It’s a tightening of these muscles

22

here, tennis elbow. In fact, by the time I got through writing notes here, I could feel it. And so, I
couldn’t sit there and take notes, and write papers, and all.
LH: Yeah.
DKF: My hand just couldn’t take it.
LH: When did you have time to write papers while you were in school?
DKF: Well, I tell you, I started at nine o’clock at night, and somehow you got ‘em done.
LH: Yeah, especially an English major. That’s a lot of writing and reading…
DKF: Yeah, I really, -- it was just weekends and nights that you did it. I can’t -- and I’m sure
during vacation periods, I probably had to go to the library to catch up so that I be sure to have it.
It was done, but I really, I really don’t have any recollection. I think I just simply kept moving,
from pillar to post. [11:45]
LH: All right. Well, did you -- when you were in school and the war was going on, I read a lot of
stories about the girls that had engagement rings, or were already married. Did you feel any less,
like …
DKF: No, I had been writing and corresponding with someone that I had met. Unfortunately, a
kamikaze took care of that, and so…
LH: Oh.
DKF: There weren’t many families that weren’t hit. I had a young cousin, just 21, and he was on
a mission, because he volunteered to cover because he’d -- ready to come home on R&R and that
was it. Then you picked up the threads of your life again. You don’t really have any choice.
LH: Yeah.
DKF: You either go on or you go under. And you have to go on. You have to bend with the
wind.
LH: Yeah. That’s something, that I -- we used to live in Europe, in Holland.
DKF: Oh, that’s interesting. You were born there?
LH: No, I’m American, but I lived there for four years.
DKF: Oh that’s exciting.
LH: That’s a community, in Holland, that doesn’t forget the war either. Once you’ve lived
through it, you just can’t ever forget it. And my generation can’t even imagine it.

23

DKF: Well, I don’t think you can imagine what you don’t experience. You can’t imagine
anything as grotesque.
LH: And horrifying and powerful.
DKF: Yeah, unbelievable. I think we here in America, no matter how we were affected by it, we
still don’t really know.
LH: Yeah.
DKF: We did business with people who were -- who managed to get out of Europe. Other Jews
that got out just in the nick of time, the women to work in factories, ‘cause that was all the work
they could get. And perhaps they had some language barrier. The men somehow managed to
become salesmen and find lines of merchandise to sell. Eventually the women joined them,
because as they became stronger, they developed -- they would have an office of their own, with
that merchandise. So if men were on the road, women were there able to sell for them. And they
were bringing relatives, who perhaps some ended up in China. A lot of people went from Europe
to China. I can’t tell you why. [14:54]
LH: Wow, I didn’t know that.
DKF: Maybe that was the only place they could get a visa to. There were just great numbers
trying to get out and they went anywhere. Some people ended up in Africa.
LH: And did they stay there for long, or did they…
DKF: Well, they had, until they could get a visa to come to America. And papers, you know, to
be admitted. So many -- the quota.
LH: Did they still go through Ellis Island, or was that the point-DKF: I don’t know. Yeah, I don’t know. I can’t tell you that.
LH: I think they stopped Ellis Island in the ‘50s. The early ‘50s.
DKF: Yeah, it, yeah it could’ve been. For all I know they could have gotten off a plane and gone
through customs there.
LH: At the airport.
DKF: I don’t think the, at that point, coming to those communities, in post war, I don’t think
there was concern about diseases as they would have been in earlier years.
LH: During the quarantines.

DKF: No, because these people, I guess they were sending them money, and they probably sent
them a passage to come. You know, tickets to come. But they must -- they were very resourceful
people, and they must have been doing some kind of business here. Because subsequently, they
were self-supporting once they got here. I’m not saying there wasn’t a transition period, but they
became self-supporting people-LH: Yeah.
DKF: --had families and took care of them. Whatever remnants there were, whether it was the
girl’s family or the man’s family, it didn’t matter because at that point if it was just somebody
who had shared something that you knew from before, that was what you needed. A sense of
community.
LH: Sanity.
DKF: Yeah. It didn’t matter how many times removed somebody might be, an aunt or an uncle,
or a cousin umpteen times removed. If it was somebody, if there was some link, that was what
they needed. And they were amazing, how they had an ingrained knowledge, that I don’t think
you’ll ever get between Harvard Business School or Wharton. Call it street smarts, or whatever
you will. There was something they could land on their feet, and rebuild. [18:00]
LH: Survival.
DKF: Yes. Not just surviving and eking out a living. Many became successful people, financially
successful. I think they were successful that they survived, but I mean some of them, in our
modern society would say, became affluent people. And, in turn, have been most generous in
helping those have been less fortunate. They walked in those shoes, and they know what it
means.
LH: Yeah, they remember.
DKF: You never forget. Any more that any of us who were Depression children ever forget it.
You never have that degree of security because you know it can happen again. I mean, for your
generation, October 19th [1987] was the nearest you will come to a crash. And that had the
cushion of institutions that were built to keep it alive. People had losses, but it was not the
wipeout. When we went, when we moved to Cambridge, and the banks closed, my father had
just transferred our funds from Rhode Island to Massachusetts. And the bank closed, and I don’t
think he ever saw a dime out of what was lost there. And there was a ten-dollar bill on the house.
That was all we had to survive on until the next’s week pay.
LH: Oh my goodness.
DKF: But, you know, butter might have been 25 cents a pound then. But even so.
LH: Even so.

DKF: I remember walking to the slaughterhouse with my mother to get the chickens. And I
remember walking…. You know, we were never hungry, but it was because she was so
resourceful. And so people who came from that era, any of us from this class, and younger -- a
little bit younger and a little bit older -- you never forget it. That’s why we remember nickel ice
cream cones, and you think in terms of two dollars or more. And we went to the movies for, I
dunno, a quarter, 35 cents, 50 cents? And 10 cents bought you three lollipops and [inaudible] at a
Saturday matinee. And you think a five-dollar bill to go to the movies.
LH: An investment.
DKF: I mean, this was the gap! That works today. And you can’t -- you know there’s someplace
to go. But when we got married, you didn’t think about, “Well, when push comes to shove, folks
are there.” Because they were struggling to make ends meet. You didn’t play house; you kept
house. And you had to get along, and you knew whatever you brought in, that’s what you had.
No less but no more. You didn’t turn to people because there was nobody to turn to. Particularly
people who were married. My folks, anyone in between then, and even when my husband and I
were married. At that time, or in subsequent years, at the ‘50s, the ‘60s, people were playing
house. Families were putting them in business, or buying them homes, or doing things for them.
I’m not sure that’s kind. [22:00]
LH: Yeah, you’re not doing them a favor.
DKF: No, because they haven’t learned to stand on their own two feet, and when they lay down,
what’s going to happen to these people who maybe couldn’t earn a week’s pay on their own?
Their ability to survive has been atrophied. [door opening] But that’s the difference in the times,
yeah.
LH: Well I think that’s all I wanted to ask you.
DKF: Okay.
LH: [inaudible] to meet your husband now Thank you.
