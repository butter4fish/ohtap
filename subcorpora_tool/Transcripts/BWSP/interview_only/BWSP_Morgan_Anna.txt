Joyce Tavon: [00:00:00] – My name is Joyce Tavon, class of ’84, and today I’m interviewing
Anna Hass Morgan, who attended Brown 1913 and 1914. We’re doing the interview on February
1st, 1987. I’d like to start by asking you a little about your family, and a little about your life
before you attended Brown. Maybe you could start with where you’re from, and –

Anna Hass Morgan: My father was of German background, born in Germany. Came over when
he was about seven years old, and he trained to be a lithograph artist. My mother was of Spanish
background, and when she was a young woman, she went to New York [00:01:00] and trained to
be a dressmaker and a tailor in a Hollander’s school of some kind, and – which she became
independent. By the time she was 20 years old, she was completely independent and working for
herself. And when I was – I was born in Providence. I’m the middle child. I had a sister, older,
and brother, a little bit younger. And Rhode – I was nine years old, we moved over the line –
state line – to Rehoboth, Massachusetts, where my folks bought a small farm. So I grew up there,
on a farm, with farm – all surrounded with farm children. I went to a one-room school, and when
I finished the one-room school, I went to high school in Taunton, [00:02:00] and then from
Taunton I went – I had become engaged to be married, but I –

JT: How old were you then, when you became engaged?
AHM: Eighteen. And I wanted to be a – I wanted to study nursing, but at that period, a girl had
to be 21, and it seemed like an awful gap to wait, and so my mother convinced me that maybe I
ought to go to college instead. And I planned to go to Mount Holyoke because a teacher in high
1

school had graduated from Mount Holyoke, and had talked a lot about it. But I became engaged
to be married when I finished high school, and my mother said that I couldn’t get married for
two years. So I decided, if I was not going to be home more than two years, I would stay at home
[00:03:00] and be with them, and I would go to Brown, where I would be nearby, and commute
and be home every night.
JT: Why is it you couldn’t marry immediately?
AHM: At 18? She didn’t approve of it. She was afraid I might change my mind. But meanwhile–
I was engaged to marry a Cuban, and at that period Cubans were as conservative and proper as
the Spaniards were, (laughter) so a woman’s life was completely in the home, outside of maiden
ladies or widows who might become schoolteachers. And my mother felt that, with an old
Spanish idea, that she had [00:04:00] to protect me and deliver me properly to my husband. So I
stayed home and went back and forth, and carried out my usual social life in Rehoboth, which
was a small town. And the congregational church was the center of all activity at that time –
social life, activity, and so forth.
JT: Let me ask you at this point – you came from a small town, but you had met your husbandto-be, who was from Cuba?

AHM: Yeah. Well, he had won a scholarship and had gone to Cornell University to study, but
when he was ready to sail and leave Havana, the government, giving him his scholarship, told
him that they needed veterinarians for the eastern part of the island. [00:05:00] In those days,
they used oxen entirely in the cane field, and they wanted him to study to be a veterinarian. At
that time, there were three young men together, all 18 years old, who had won the scholarships
from different parts of the island, and the other two changed their minds when they got to
Cornell. They didn’t tell the government, and they became engineers. My husband was very
honest - very good man - and he felt, if his government was paying him for an education, paying
his education, that he ought to do what they wanted him to do.

JT: So, but how did you meet him if he was at Cornell?
2

AHM: It happened that his mother was friendly with a Cuban schoolteacher in Havana,
[00:06:00] and she had married a cousin of my mother’s. And this schoolteacher had come to
Harvard on a summer course, right after the end of – soon after the end of the Spanish-American
War. She had come to study American methods of education, and she had married a cousin. So
after my husband entered college, his mother died right then, that fall, and left him the care of an
11-year-old brother. So he was going to give up college, but the Spanish colony in Allston – all
my relatives – convinced him that, between them all, they could take care of a boy that was only
12 years old at the time. So he brought his brother [00:07:00] to Boston and he went to Cornell.
But every summer, he came to Boston and he worked in that big veterinary hospital – what is it?
Angell (inaudible) they call it downtown – and he worked there every summer to help out on his
income, and help the costs of his brother.
JT: So you met him, really, through your family – your extended family?

AHM: Yes. Yeah, and he went back, and then we became engaged by mail, and then he came up
every summer, each summer, to visit. And when I graduated from high school, we became
engaged to be married.

JT: So at 18 you were engaged to be married?

AHM: Yeah.

JT: And you decided to attend Brown?

AHM: And I knew I was going to go to a [00:08:00] remote part of the island. He had told me
what life would be like out there. So when I went to Brown, I had a conference with the dean in
which I told her I didn’t want to spend any time on mathematics or science – that I could read
that, but I wanted to study – I especially wanted the English course “Training to Write Better”
and so forth, and I wanted anything I could get in history. But I especially wanted to study
Spanish. And Pembroke did not teach Spanish, so they sent me over on the hill to the men’s
3

college to study, and I was in a class with a Professor Albert Bushnell Johnson, who was about
past middle age, a bachelor – [00:09:00] teacher, a professor. And he had a class of 25 men, and
I was the only girl in it. He didn’t like the idea that the dean had consented to me studying
Spanish, which he felt as though one girl in the class would disrupt his class. So he made me sit
in the back row, and all of his men students sat in the two front rows, but every time he called on
me, 25 heads would turn around to look at me. I was too self-conscious to do any damage at all.
(laughter) Then he would stop to announce, “I am going to call on Miss Hass. Please don’t
everyone turn around to look. She is here.” (laughter) And then the dean told me, [00:10:00] in
the interview we had, that she felt that if I was getting married, I ought to study biology so as to
learn what marriage was all about. So I consented, although the subject I wanted to take had a
conflict with the history that I wanted. But she still insisted that biology, she felt, was more
important, so I had to take that over in the laboratory on the hill. And that was a whole girls’
class that went over to the laboratory. No men in the class. And to learn my relationship with a
new husband, my first specimen was a worm.

JT: (laughter)

AHM: My second specimen was an embryo pig. My third specimen was a dried-out cat that I
had to share [00:11:00] with another girl, because dried cats – they have a scientific term for
them – but they were treated for nerves and muscles, so you could study all the nerves, the veins,
blood vessels, the nervous system, and muscles. And I had to share the cat. I thought that was the
height of indignity. I had come from a farm. As far as I was concerned, there were more cats in
this world than there ought to be. (laughter) That was Miss Danielson. Was not only a wonderful
teacher, but she was pretty advanced, I thought, for her age – for the period we were in – because
when she talked about sex, she was much [00:12:00] more explicit than – much more than the
dean was, (laughter) and very much more than most of the married women I had ever met were
at that time. And she did pull down the shades on the side of the room where there a lot of men. I
don’t know whether it was a men’s dormitory or classrooms also, but she always carefully pulled
down the shades on that side. However, in her teaching, she was very explicit in drawing on the
blackboard and making us copy into our notebooks for us to understand, and apparently up to
then – I had studied physiology in high school, but the sex organs were completely omitted.
4

[00:13:00] I had studied one short course in physiology in the eighth grade in grammar school,
and sex organs were completely omitted. Well, as a farm girl, I didn’t need much instruction in
sex, because it was all around me in the springtime between cats and sheep –

JT: (laughter)
AHM: – and the cow – having cows, and all that sort of thing. And the relationship of bulls to
cows was especially common discussion on the farm, where the housewife mark up the calendar
when the calf was due, you know, and that sort of thing. But the dean thought that it would just
finish my education, so I took it, see? The second year, I –

JT: Could you first maybe say a little bit more? [00:14:00] Do you remember any other classes
you took your first year?

AHM: Oh, yes. I have some notes here. At that period, I was very conscious that girls came from
everywhere. One girl I met came from Iowa. I never developed a close friendship with her. She
was very nice, but she seemed very remote. The morning I went up to college, because
Providence was so near, to me it was just like going to high school, so my mother didn’t go. But
when I got to the dean’s off– outside her waiting room, outside the dean’s office, [00:15:00] I
was surprised to see a number of girls, and their mothers were with them. I never found out
whether they were town girls or girls who were going to live at the dorm, but I was a little bit
surprised that mothers came to register girls in college. I can understand why (inaudible).

JT: And did you walk to school? How did you get there?

AHM: No, I took the Interurban into Providence.

JT: Was a train?

5

AHM: Yeah, it was an electric trolley. And then I walked up from Market Square. And at that
time, the cable cars were running, and one of the big excitements was once in a great while a
cable car got loose and went racing down the hill.

JT: (laughter)

AHM: [00:16:00] But traffic was so light, and then there were no automobiles that I could
remember. It was just horses and wagons, and so forth, and nothing ever happened. I guess it
happened... Well, I guess, maybe two or three times while I lived in the Providence area or out in
Rehoboth, that this type of an accident happened, but I never rode on the cable car because the
fare was five cents, and I walked up the hill. I just took it for granted. Such a short distance up a
hill. You walked. Who would ever take a trolley? Looking from it now, from my age, I would be
very glad to have a trolley to go up that hill. At that time, in the English class, [00:17:00] I had
all classmates – that was all in the women’s college, and our professor – our teacher – was John
Henry Williams taught us English. He was very, very good, and he had an assistant called Carl
Cooper, and I didn’t like Carl Cooper because he would mark up your thing correcting it, but he
never had a very good explanation of why. I always wanted to know why. Not that I cared
particularly about the mark itself, but it was, you know, “Why this?” or “Why that?” And then,
as I said, Miss Danielson – I had a strange experience some years later –

JT: She was the biology teacher?
AHM: – yes – while I was in this very remote, small town in Cuba, and during the crop, it had a
colony of about maybe 12 or 15 American couples. And one of the couples had a guest, and so
she had an afternoon tea. Well, I lived in two worlds. I was associating with the Cuban women. I
would go to their homes and visit them because they were friends of my husband’s, the families.
But I would visit the Americans, because I was an American too. And one of the women gave an
afternoon tea, and I went, and I was surprised to meet this woman. And I commented to her, I
said, “I don’t want to make a comparison, but you look so much like a teacher I had at Brown,
that I just can’t get over the similarity.” [00:19:00] And she said, “Who was she?” And I said,
“Her name was Miss Danielson from Connecticut,” and she said, “Oh, I’m her first cousin.”
6

(laughter) Small world after all. That struck me as strange. And as I said, Professor Johnson, I
thought he was very grumpy, and (laughter) –

JT: He was your English professor?

AHM: No, Johnson taught me Spanish.
JT: Oh, your Spanish –

JT: Yeah, and I thought he was pretty grumpy. And years later, when my husband was there as a
teacher, there was a young couple – DeLand – Graydon DeLand - taught Spanish and my
husband taught Spanish, and Professor Johnson had bought a place out in Rehoboth. And he had
meanwhile married, and so they used to invite us out there periodically for dinner, [00:20:00]
and of course, as he was Head of Spanish, we were very much on our good behavior. The two
wives were behaving properly, naturally, but we were always very, very amused that he always
talked at the table – he would still talk to me as if I were his student, although he was now
merely outranking my husband a little bit as a professor, naturally. It was very – I thought it was
quite amusing. When I went to the college, I enjoyed it very much, but I felt older than the other
girls. I don’t know whether it was my life on the farm compared to [00:21:00] – most of these
other girls were city girls. I had the same feelings about my cousins in Allston, Massachusetts.
When I visited them in the summertime, I used to think, “They don’t have anything to do all
summer.” But on a small farm, there’s chickens to feed and give water to. And my mother, who
felt – she didn’t have an outside job in those days, so there was a lot of canning. As the different
fruits and vegetables came in there was a great deal, and I know a common thing for her to do in
the morning was to wake us up and say, “You got to get a big start today. The huckleberries are
ripe. You got to go down there. I don’t want you to stop until you’ve picked 20 quarts.” And
she’d hand out pails, (laughter) and that was it.

JT: So you had a lot of responsibilities at a young age?

7

AHM: Yes. And I enjoyed fun, but when I got to college, I was [00:22:00] awfully surprised –
another thing – maybe because all the boys I had been raised with –for example, going through
the one-room school – you were with those same boys. I entered in the third grade. From the
third grade through the ninth grade I was with those same boys. I got acquainted with them
almost like brothers. I never could’ve fallen in love with any of them. I knew them too well, you
know? (laughter) And then in high school, I had little time for the boys because we took the
Interurban trolley. We’d ride just when school was beginning. School let out in time for us to just
catch the trolley home, or wait another hour, so half the time we spent almost jogging for the
trolley. We had no time for social life, so that outside a little bit of conversation [00:23:00] with
the boys in class, usually about subjects you were studying, I had no relationship with those boys
at all. And so when I got to Brown, I would go in with the girls, and listen to them and so forth,
and I used to be quite surprised at the conversations they were having. And they were very, very
much interested in boys, which I didn’t understand at that time. It was funny. But I enjoyed – At
that period, they had, in the basement, a small counter –

JT: Basement of Pembroke Hall?
AHM: – at Pembroke – where they served coffee, and the only drink I remember was Moxie
from that period. And Moxie was sold all through New England, but it was only years later, after
[00:24:00] I got to Chicago, I discovered that some people in the United States had never drank
Moxie.

JT: What is Moxie?
AHM: It’s very much like Coke would be. I don’t know whether sarsaparilla’s the base, or what
it is. And also they served coffee or tea. But when I would get down at noontime – the way my
classes came out, I had to wait over from morning over to the afternoon, and so I took at least a
hot drink, and many times I’d buy a sandwich. But by the time I would get there, coming back
from my Spanish class, the dorm girls, as we looked around, were all so intimate, they were all
paired off at tables. There were little tables that held two. And so I was usually in the position
[00:25:00] of sitting with someone else, and I sat – I became quite intimate with one girl. She
8

lived on the hill and her father was a musician, and she was very interesting. She played in the
Bijou movie picture house at the foot of the hill. She was an only child.

JT: Played piano, or?

AHM: Piano. Yes, and this was the days before the music came with the film, and she studied
piano for years, and she was such a musician that she could watch the film or carry on a side
conversation, and according to what the film showed, she would play the proper thing, whether it
was a wedding or a hanging, or a baptism, or whatever it was. They all did it at that time. That’s
the way the piano players handled it. [00:26:00] And so she and I had quite a [warm?] friendship,
and one time I had the – I mean, periodically, I’d go to her house, but – and then one day I came
in, I sat down with – I asked a young girl if I could sit down with her table because all the tables
were filled, of course, and we sat there and we got acquainted, and she was Jewish. And I was so
surprised, because I never remembered that I had ever known a Jewish person before. There
might’ve been Jewish girls in high school, but I never socialized in high school because I was
always running from the bus or to – I mean from the trolley or back to the trolley. I had no social
life in high school. And so she – for the first time in my life, [00:27:00] I heard somebody talk
about discrimination. And this was a whole new idea to me. My father was – My mother never
told me for many years, but my father was a secret Socialist (laughter) – I mean, he was in
sympathy with the Socialists. And so a lot of his interpretation was along that line, without me
even knowing why. I know that at one time – it was right after an election, and I came home and
I – I was in high school – and I said, “There were three Socialist votes in Rehoboth,” and my
father said – oh, I said, “I’m pretty well I know a couple of them.” And my father said,
[00:28:00] “Who are they?” And I said, “Well, one is that little German on the other road who
has a machine in his barn that makes tacks.” And then there was another one, a woman, that
people said she was a socialist. But I didn’t know who the third one was, and my father said it
wasn’t any of my business how people – that’s why we had the secret ballot, you know?
(laughter) It was kind of funny. So this young Jewish girl talked to me, and I told my father
about it. He told me a lot then about discrimination, either race, and all that sort of thing. Then,
she and I became very good friends, and I found that somehow or other we clicked quite well. I
was very curious about lots of things, and I said to her [00:29:00] once, “You know, I’ve never
9

been to a burlesque show,” and she says, “Neither have I.” And I said, “My family would have a
fit if I went, but why don’t you and I go together early enough in the evening so that it wouldn’t
be dangerous?” So we went to this burlesque show in Providence – I think it was on Westminster
Street – and we were standing there, and I said to her – you know, we said we wouldn’t sit down.
We’d just stand in the back – and I said to her, “We have to be very careful, because if the dean
came in, we could be kicked out of school for that.” And she got to laughing so hard at the idea
of the dean coming in to the burlesque show, that it attracted a little attention, and all of a
sudden, a cousin of my mother’s, who [00:30:00] worked for the Providence journal, walked
over in surprise, and he said, “What are you doing here?” I was awfully afraid he was going to
tell my parents, but nothing came of it. I don’t think he ever told.
Another time, Mr. Williams, the English teacher... I should explain that for English, we
had to write a theme – a short one – every day in the week. And then we always had one long
one a month due, and that was always [writing?]. You had to do research for it. It had to be a
subject you had to go into. And I guess that from my themes, he knew a lot about my thinking,
naturally, and one day he came down to my desk where I was sitting, and he said to me, “There
is going to be a meeting tonight at the foot of the [00:31:00] hill, and I think Eugene Debs –” that
was the socialist candidate for the presidency – he said, “I think he’s going to speak. I thought
you’d be interested.” So I thanked him, and that night – or that afternoon – I found my Jewish
friend and I asked her, “Would you like to go tonight?” We found the place was roped all off.
The police were there. A lot of men were protesting, some women, and they said there was going
to be no meeting. But I was awfully surprised to find my father there. I was really quite afraid,
because I thought my mother would now know that I was at the meeting – she’d scold me. So I
went up to my father and I said, “Hello,” I said, “I told Ma I went to a movie.” And he looked
very embarrassed, [00:32:00] and he said, “I told your mother I was working overtime.”
(laughter) So the both of us... And another thing interesting thing looking back – this girl went
back to the hill in the evening alone, and I got on the trolley with my father and went out to the
country back home. And she thought nothing of coming down the hill and going back after dark
and so forth, where now, so many years later, it’s more or less difficult for girls to go around
much alone in the city at night, especially some parts of the city.
Another thing that amused me that – we had to go to chapel every morning, and we were
allowed something like, I guess, three absences a month or something. It wasn’t very much,
10

[00:33:00] and a monitor kept a record. I was excused from gym because the dean recognized
that I had plenty of exercise on the farm, but she didn’t excuse me from chapel. And this was a
little difficult, because I had to make chapel, and then I had to wait over – but I took that time for
studying – and then I went to my Spanish class. And it happened that in this chapel – it was very
interesting. The upper-class girls had a singing group of some kind, and they used to sing very
nice little classical pieces that they had rehearsed, and so forth. They had a monitor that took our
attendance. And then the dean would speak a few inspiring words, or sometimes instructing us
on something. And I remember at that time, of course an awful lot of [00:34:00] talk was about
white slavery, and the dean had explained to us the dangers of girls talking to strange men or
allowing strange men to talk to them, and she told us never to admit that we go to college,
because some men might trace us easily to Pembroke. And she told us never to discuss anything
with another girl on the street or on a trolley, or in any place where we could be overheard, in a
restaurant or someplace. In other words, everything was very, very careful for the girls, you
know what I mean? A guidance or protection, where nowadays, any girl would know all of that
before she finished grammar school – [00:35:00] I mean how to take care of herself, you know?
Another things was that she used to read very inspiring bits of poetry. And I personally liked her.
I liked her very much. I thought that –

JT: Is this the dean we were talking about before the tape began?

AHM: Uh-huh. I liked the Dean King.

JT: Her name was Dean King?

AHM: Yeah. I liked her very much. I thought that she was kind of innocent in the world. In other
words, some of things she – I don’t know whether she was keeping her lectures for proper young
ladies. Maybe, but her very (inaudible) talked to me – she spent some time with me trying to
convince me, for example, that I would be better off not to get married then. Another thing that
[00:36:00] surprised me –
JT: Why did she feel you shouldn’t get married?
11

AHM: She thought I was too young, inexperienced, and so forth, and it was just – it wasn’t
interfering, it was just kind discussion about marriage. And I told her that I would much rather
become a nurse, but to wait till I was 21, I thought, was an awful gap – 18 to 21. And then, after I
got married, I became pregnant, and within one year I came back to the States to have my first
child. And I was at the homeopathic hospital in Providence, and the young nurse took care of me,
and she was only – she was my age then. She was just 20, see, because my birthday comes late in
the year. [00:37:00] She was just 20, and I asked her – and here she was, already on the floor,
taking care of patients. And I asked her, “How did you get this training, when everybody I
approached, they said I had to be 21?” And she said, “Well, my mother lost my birth certificate.
It was burned up in the town hall fire.” And I said, “What town was that in?” She says, “My
mother never could remember.” In other words, the mother had sworn her age, and had said she
didn’t have a birth certificate because it had been burned in a fire. And I was very annoyed with
my mother. When she came in, I scolded my mother for – why didn’t she look up some town that
had burned up –

JT: (laughter)
AHM: – and sign up for me? But it was altogether too late then.

JT:

I’d like to ask you a little bit [00:38:00] more about your time at Brown. When you

entered the school and you were engaged, did you know at that time that you wouldn’t be staying
for four years?
AHM: Oh, yes. That’s why I told the dean I wanted to choose special subjects, because my
feeling was that I wanted these subjects, and not mathematics, and not science. It was what I was
particularly interested in, and was sort of a broader knowledge. And I was very disappointed
when the history that I wanted – instead of the biology – came at the same time, and she said, no,
she still felt I ought to take the biology.
JT: So you took biology, English, Spanish –
12

AHM: And Spanish. And that’s the three subjects that I took as a special student, see?

JT: For the whole two years you were there?

AHM: [00:39:00] No, and then second year, I went to Professor Johnson and I told him I thought
the class was going very slowly.

JT: The Spanish class?
AHM: The Spanish class. And he said that he couldn’t make it go any faster, that students
weren’t studying any faster. And so he agreed to tutor me, and so then I went back to the dean
and told her, and she says, “He doesn’t usually do that,” but she says, “I’m not going to object to
that,” she says, “because you do need Spanish, and I want you to get all that you can get.” And
then I told her that I wanted American and English literature, see, and so she told me that – oh,
and then what she was offering me – I didn’t want the literature [00:40:00] she was offering me.
It was beginning with Chaucer, and I had covered Chaucer in high school, you know? I had had
quite a lot of that. In fact, the high school preparation at that period was a college preparation,
and then if you weren’t going to college, you took the English course, which was considered
much easier. And so then, I signed up to study two afternoon courses in literature, but Professor
Johnson gave me a period that was right after the twelve o’clock ended – twelve o’clock study
ended. It was considered the lunch period. So I made much more progress that way, because I
could go faster. And then [00:41:00] I found that the book I was studying from was a book although my husband was studying – was a veterinary student. In order to earn money in college
he had helped Olmstead and Gordon to write a big thick Spanish grammar. And my husband-tobe had written all the Spanish exercises.

JT: In your Spanish book?

AHM: In the Spanish book. And he had also proofread the whole thing after it had been set up,
so that in the introduction, in the preface, the professors had thanked him for the Spanish
13

guidance for them. They were both Americans. And so in other words, he was a good scholar in
his own [00:42:00] language, and he would like to have gone in that. After we married, I
discovered that he was the last man in the world that should have been a veterinarian, so when
we came up here – and the reason that we had to come back was that I –
JT: Can I just interrupt you? And we’ll come back to that –

AHM: Yeah.
JT: – later. I just want to finish. In your second year at Brown, you still continued with the
Spanish through tutoring, took some literature... Any other kinds of courses that you took?

AHM: And it was history.

JT: Oh, you did take history? What kind of history did you take?
AHM: Yeah, and it was just – it was called World History. It was like a survey. And then after
that, after I came back from Cuba – I came back because I had [00:43:00] tropical malaria, and I
had been very sick, and they always said the first child died because I had had it so bad while I
was pregnant. So anyway, after I came back, and then I introduced my husband to Professor
Johnson and reminded him that this was the man who had done all the work on the Spanish
exercises in the book, and Professor Johnson was interested, and he engaged my husband in the
fall to – And so then after my husband had been teaching for some time – I guess a year, or
maybe two – Dr. Faunce, who was president of the college, wrote him a note and said that if he
was going to continue teaching, he would like to have him have a liberal arts degree for the
appearance of the catalogue. [00:44:00] After all, a DVM, you know, when you’re teaching a
language, isn’t so impressive. And so then my – And what annoyed me at the period was that
they did not give my husband a comprehensive exam, you know, in the language, in English.
And his English was excellent.

JT: You were going to say that you – something you enjoyed at Brown?

AHM: One thing I enjoyed very much at Brown was that periodically, on Sunday afternoon
during the winter, they had a tea, and the girls gathered. And I wanted to know the girls better,
and so after I left church, I would go then into Providence. I’d go up on the hill. And the tea was
around – I don’t know, I guess it must’ve been three o’clock in the afternoon. It was a little bit
later. [00:45:00] And some local person – some interesting teacher or somebody – would come
in, and I know we sat in a circle, and they would discuss something, the speaker would, maybe
about music or a book, Something of that sort. And we’d all have that, and we’d have general
conversation. It was like a social hour. I guess that for the girls in the dorm, it was one more tea
that they went to. To me it was a little trip into town and associating with girls, because
naturally, on the farm, as I was older – my mother felt that we ought to do more for the minister,
that he worked very hard. So she always had me line up to drive the minister around town to call
on sick people, because the minister had no horse and buggy. And I would [00:46:00] drive him
around, especially to drive to funerals. My mother always promised the carriage with the horse,
and the carriage that held three other people besides myself.
JT: So your Sunday teas, then, were your opportunity to – your Sun– the Sunday teas were your
opportunity to get away and socialize.

AHM: Yes. So I had a chance to mix with a lot of young women, and hear them talk and discuss
things, and I always found it interesting. But sometimes, around four o’clock in the afternoon on
a school day, they would have a very interesting lecturer who came from someplace. And one
woman stood out in my mind, and her name was Lillian Wall, and she came from New York,
and she was a social worker. And another one was the author Reisman or Reeseman, something
– [00:47:00] he wrote books along that line, about social work, and I thought he was very
interesting, because when I was a child I always thought I would like to be a medical missionary,
but as I got older I realized I wasn’t religious enough, and I didn’t think any church would take
me on because of that.

15

JT: Can I ask you a little on how you paid to go to Brown? Did you parents pay your way?
AHM: Oh, yes. And they didn’t object – It wasn’t easy, but for the times we were in it wasn’t
impossible. And the car fares were only – let’s see – 20 cents a day. Although, 20 cents in those
days meant [00:48:00] more than now. And another thing I enjoyed was that the girls used to say
that the Brown boys looked down on the Pembroke girls among themselves. They would say that
quite often, but – and I didn’t have a chance to find out, because being engaged, I didn’t expect
to date. In fact, I wore an engagement ring with a diamond so that – and my husband-to-be made
my mother promise that I would wear the diamond every day to college, and she checked that as
well as she checked wearing my rubbers. And then they had (inaudible) that every time we went
on the men’s campus we had to wear a hat and coat and gloves. And one day, the first day of
spring in my first year there, it was so beautiful that I just happily left the farm, and I didn’t wear
[00:49:00] – well, I might’ve had a jacket with me and hung it up in Pembroke Hall, that was all.
And I was so surprised, when I came out of the Spanish class, that two upper-class girls met me
and they were very serious, and they said, “You know that you shouldn’t come over here without
your hat and coat and gloves,” and they had me walk back with them to Pembroke Hall, just as if
I was under arrest, but then when I got there, they told me that they wouldn’t report me to the
dean. Oh, and another time, one of the girls told me that I mustn’t come through the main gates –
that’s the gate that looks down on Waterman Street, yeah. I mustn’t come up through the main
gate, that only the men came through that gate, that we must use the side gate. Well, I never
came to class through the main gate, but when I was going [00:50:00] home it was a lot shorter,
and I went home through the main gate and down the hill. I figured that I wouldn’t meet anybody
that way. And I know that – I didn’t wear my engagement ring, and I know that once, Professor
Williams asked me to come to his office, and I was kind of concerned, because everybody is, you
wonder, you know, “What’s the matter with my schoolwork? Am I not doing...” And then he
asked me if I was engaged to be married because I wore an engagement ring, and I said yes, and
he asked me if I had considered a career of any kind. And I was so surprised at a man instructor –
he was very respectful in every way, but I was just surprised that a man instructor would
[00:51:00] raise the question where the girl is already engaged, you know? So then he asked me
who I was marrying, and I told him I was going to Cuba. And he shook his head, but he was very
polite about it in every way. And then another time, one of the men in the professor’s class
16

approached me and asked me if I was going down the hill, and I said yes, and he said that –
wanted to know if he could walk along with me. And I said, “Certainly,” so we walked along,
and right away he began to ask me, was I engaged to be married? Because I guess there had been
some gossip at that period about a girl wearing a diamond ring, as young as I was. And I told him
yes, and then afterwards it dawned on me that maybe the [00:52:00] class – the men among
themselves – were curious about why one girl from Pembroke comes to study Spanish, but was –
Oh, and one of the interesting students that I met – and she was a special student. In fact, she had
been getting permission for special courses from the dean, and she was about 35. She was an
Italian widow, and she wore heavy crepe, as they used to – in those – She did have a modern hat
on, but we called her Donnie Jones. But a heavy, heavy veil hung down with a big heavy border
around, and everything she wore was black. And one of the girls told me that she was a widow,
and she was from Italy, and she was studying science, and she was studying just science, and
that’s what she wanted...
JT: [00:53:00] Most of the other girls – were any of them engaged too, or was it unusual?
AHM: No, it wasn’t usual. My sister went to Simmons College, and they had a two-year – that
was in home economics – and they had the “diamond ring course,” which was for engaged skills,
and my sister said that the whole emphasis was on practical cooking and housekeeping, and so
forth. And they got a diploma, which was for the two-year course. And my sister finished, and
then she went to Columbia afterwards, then she worked for the Y.
JT: So – But at Brown, the emphasis wasn’t on home economics –

AHM: No, no.
JT: – or things like that, when you were there?
AHM: I wasn’t even aware that they had a course at that time of home economics. I think they
were all [classical?] courses, and some [00:54:00] science. So anyway, then – and I know that
many times, on nice days – the minister’s son from my town had entered the same year I did. We
17

didn’t travel always on the same bus or the same trolleys, because of the arrangement of the
classes, and – but some days it came the same, and we used to walk down on South Main Street,
which was really (laughter) a seafront – like a seafront situation there. A lot of sailors of different
colors, and a whole lot of stores, and you heard foreign languages all around you. And we used
to think it was one of the most exciting places that we could imagine, and it was just South Main.
[00:55:00] Wickenden Street, Providence, you know? I think of that many times, and now I drive
through there, and here the – everything has been changed, with the big highways and everything
else like that, you know?

JT: Any other memories of Brown? Any bad memories?
AHM: No, I didn’t – Periodically they had parties at night, and when – and they allowed you to
bring a friend, of the town girls. I had a friend that I could stay overnight with in Providence, and
I’d bring her to the party, and they celebrated like – I remember Halloween and Valentine’s Day,
but it seemed almost to me like a strange party, because there were no boys. It was all girls. In
other words, I was very conscious of the atmosphere [00:56:00] of all girls.

JT: Separation.

AHM: Yeah. And later on, when I went to the Midwest where they had these great big colleges,
coeducation, I thought it was much closer to life. The girls might’ve got into trouble more, but on
the other hand, those that did at least were closer to life. They associated with boys in such a
way. They didn’t have that extremely romantic idea of the boys.
JT: So in your time at Brown, they never had, I don’t know, mixers or dances with the boys from
Brown?
AHM: No, and I never heard of the local girls – of the girls going – among the girls, I used to
hear criticism and talk that the boys didn’t date the Pembroke girls. But it never concerned me
because I wouldn’t have been dating any of those boys [00:57:00] anyway, on account of being

18

engaged. It wouldn’t have been proper, you know, of course. But I – as I say, that was a very
small part of my life compared to everything else.
JT: But you didn’t even – it didn’t seem to be going on, that there were the socials with the –
AHM: No, but I wasn’t – I mean, I heard no talk about – the way you hear now among girls
about “the dance last night,” “I’m going to a dance, I’m going to –” or “what I’m going to do,”
and all that sort of thing, you know, see?

JT: Was there a real division between the girls who lived in the dorms, and people like you, who
commuted?

AHM: Was there what?

JT: A real division.
AHM: I don’t think – I think the dorm girls were so concentrated on their lives because they
were together. I don’t think that they were aware of us [00:58:00] so much, of us outside. You
might sit next to one in class, and she’d ask you where you’re from, you know, and you’re a
local, see? But the girls outside were really very scattered, so when I made a friend with a girl on
the outside, it was more unusual than if I had been living in the dorm. Now, this young Jewish
girl that I met, her folks had a summer place down the river, and when spring came she asked me
if I would go with her over one weekend, and help her put the cottage in order, because the
family was coming, and we went down. I got permission from my mother, and we went on a
Friday night, and I know we sat on the embankment and watched the New York boats go out.
[00:59:00] And somehow we talked – we talked an awful lot about religion because it was a such
a difference in religion. And my mother’s side of the family was Catholic until she married my
father, and my father’s Protestant, and I was raised in the congregational church, so that I had
been exposed to religions more. And so we compared a lot about what our religious backgrounds
were, with a very frank talking. And another thing – she had her problems, because she wanted
to take engineering, and oh the dean couldn’t get over that, a girl... And you know, I figured, she
19

would’ve graduated in 1917, just when we went into the war. I often wondered what became of
her. Maybe she went to Washington. (laughter)

JT: Did she take engineering?

AHM: What?

JT: Did she take engineering?

AHM: [01:00:00] Yeah.

JT: They let her?
AHM: Yeah. But she said that – And we used to raise the question in our discussion, were they
against her because she was studying engineering, or was it because she was Jewish? And she
was convincing me it was a good part of it because she was Jewish, and she would explain to me
how she had experienced discrimination, you know, because I wasn’t aware of it at all.
Although, my mother told me that when she was in Cambridge, in her childhood, that she was
aware that people discriminated awfully against the Irish at that time. And then my mother, as a
young woman, some of her cousins married young women from Irish families, and they claimed
there was discrimination where the cousins that had married from a German family, at that
period, said [01:01:00] that they had – they weren’t aware of discrimination.

JT: So I guess it was still unusual for there to be a Jewish student at Brown at that time.
AHM: I guess so. I never – Because I wasn’t experienced with names or anything like that, I
wasn’t aware of it in high school. And in high school, we had only one black student in the
whole high school.

JT: How about while you were at Brown?

20

AHM: Oh, I don’t remember any black students. I don’t remember seeing any black students. If
there were, they must’ve been pretty light, you know? No, some American Negroes were quite
light – could be taken for Italians or something, you know?
JT: I’m going to stop it.

[01:01:54] (break in audio)

JT: You were going to comment on the dress code?

AHM: Well, one thing I remember was that the dean [01:02:00] said that a lady always wore a
hat and gloves, even if it was too warm for a jacket, that’s out on the street – that she always had
a hat and gloves on. Another thing was that we were supposed to wear our hair up. We were
young ladies now. In high school, some girls of the senior class who had very thick hair had
perhaps two braids, or one braid, or something. But the dean didn’t want any girls to wear their
hair hanging down their back at all. And another thing – the hobble skirt was at its height then,
and the dean was very worried about the –

[01:02:49] (silence)

Track 2
JT: [00:00] This is part two of an interview. My name is Joyce Tavon, class of ’84. I’m
interviewing Anna Hass Morgan, who attended Brown in 1913 and 1914. Today’s date is
February 1, 1987. You were talking a little about the dress code and the fashion at that time, and
the dean’s fear of the girls wearing the hobble skirt.
AHM: Yeah, the hobble skirt came down – all girls’ skirts came down to their ankles at that
time, but the hobble skirt had the narrow hem at the bottom. It tapered in so that it had to have a
slit on the side, or you couldn’t step up on the trolley car. And finally, the skirts became so
narrow at the bottom that there seemed to be a competition to see who could wear the narrowest
21

skirt. So that’s wear the word “hobble” came in [01:00] on the skirt. And then, to be able to step
up on the trolleys, you had to have – the side seam had to be split up to the knee, otherwise you
couldn’t step up. And so the dean said that she didn’t like the hobble skirt, but those of us who
were wearing it must fill the space of the slit with a four-inch ruffle, and she would like to have
the ruffle to match in colors, even though – not material. You might have woolen plaid hobble
skirt, but she’d like to see colors to match. But some of the girls didn’t like that at all, and they
would wear the ruffle that looked as if they had the wildest petticoats on you could imagine, you
know? And [02:00] there was always that feeling of, “Is the dean going to see me in this skirt
with the slit on the side of it?” And the ruffle, it was so wide, you know? I followed the rule of
the ruffle, because even my mother didn’t like hobble skirts, and I never had it to such an
extreme. But when the dean said we should put the ruffle in, I did put the ruffle in. The idea of a
ruffle was to conceal the leg. And I put my ruffle in because the dean wanted it, but my mother
was very glad that the dean had us do it. That was [to me?].

[02:47] (break in audio)

JT: You said you wanted to comment on the current events of the time while you were at Brown.
AHM: Yeah. I remember, at the time, that we – that there was the [03:00] Bulgarian War going
on in the Balkans. And at that time, what impressed me was Bulgarian bacillus was developed,
and that became for a period of time a treatment for children with serious intestinal infections,
which so many of the American children got in the summertime, because in the wintertime – in
the cool climate – you don’t have those infections developing. Another thing I remembered was
that in – at that period, was a lot more talk – first of all, one of the interesting things was that all
around the streets of Providence, there were signs – “Do not spit on the sidewalk.” [04:00] There
was a big drive against tuberculosis, and the “Don’t spit on the sidewalk – $20 fine.” And
another thing was the fear of – as I spoke before – about white slavery. And the Mann Act was
passed at that period, and that’s still in effect, of course. And then another thing that had come up
was the sinking of the Lusitania, of course, but that was in 1915. But there was a lot of a [war?]
feeling among the people. Newspapers carried news of what was building in Europe, you know?

22

JT: Already, during your time at Brown?

AHM: Yes. And meanwhile, things got very tense on the question [05:00] in Mexico, because
the United States wanted the Mexicans to give us a 20-gun salute. That was to punish them for
violating something or other, and they refused, but Wilson allowed it to go on. Another thing
was the Chinese Sun Yat-sen revolution, which set the Republic, and the Chinese cut off their
pigtails. But when I was a young girl, all the Chinese that we knew that had come all wore long
pigtails curled up around on the top of their head, and a tiny cap on the top. And that – I don’t
know, maybe those things came to our attention more because – [06:00] at the dinner table at
night –

JT: So were these things that you really discussed at Brown, or was it more you discussed at
home?

AHM: It was at home, but it influenced me, and all my things I was writing. Looking for an idea
to write, I was making the comments on the day. And you see, women didn’t have the right to
vote yet, and so periodically I was picking that up for comments in my little daily theme that I
had to produce, was the women’s right to vote, and that sort of thing.

JT: Well, what was your opinion at that time?
AHM: Oh, I wanted the women to have the right, but I lived in the country. I wasn’t anywhere
near the demonstrations that were going on in Boston and in Washington D.C., and all of that,
you know? (laughter)

JT: Were your parents supportive of you attending school, [07:00] f orming your opinions, and
all of that?

AHM: Oh, yes. And at the table, everything was a regular debating society for part of the time,
because things came up, and we all expressed opinions on it, and discussed all those things. And
I had a grandfather who was on the (inaudible) lines, and he would visit us, and would tell about
23

trips that he made to Vera Cruz, and Buenos Aires, and Rio de Janeiro, and Havana. And I used
to think it was just marvelous to travel. Maybe all of that interest helped to influence me in being
interested in a man who came from faraway Cuba. Cuba was much farther away in those days.
The year that – 1914, [08:00] first the Panama Canal was finished. That was a very big thing.
Another thing in 1914 was that the Key West Railroad that came all the way to New York was
finished, so you could go from Havana on a ferry to Key West. And they had a popular song
then, “Twenty-Four Hours from Broadway,” and that was the height of speed, when you could
think of it, to think that you could come on a train from Key West, and you were going to come
from Havana across to Key West, and then on the train to New York. And you were 24 hours
from Broadway. So the world was getting smaller. And of course, after the war was over,
naturally, there was a lot more flying and passenger planes, and all of that.

JT: I want to turn to your time [09:00] after Brown.

[09:02] (break in audio)
JT: So let me ask you now, after you – You left Brown after two years. What happened then?

AHM: I went to Cuba and lived for four years, but I got very sick with malaria. However, I only
had a couple of mild attacks after I got back, and it cleared up. Then we settled in Rehoboth, and
in time, my husband went to teach at Brown.

JT: Let me go back and ask you just a little about your time in Cuba. At that time, your husband
was working as a veterinarian?

AHM: Veterinarian for the Cuban American Shipping Company.

JT: And you were what, raising family?

AHM: No, I had the baby and then I taught in the company school. I taught English, and I had
classes, and then, at that time –
24

JT: This was what, the American Sugar – one of the sugar com–
AHM: Cuban American Sugar Company, yeah. [10:00] And at that time, young people – only
the boys went onto – most of the – went onto high school, unless the girls went to a religious
school of nuns. But boys who wanted to go to the big city to high school wanted more
preparation, and they asked me to tutor them, so I would tutor them at night, after January, from
January till June when school closed. I would tutor them, and mostly in mathematics, geography,
history, and that was what they had to have most of. But in the daytime I taught English to the
students, and then I came back here to this country, and then my husband taught at Brown, and
we built a house across the road from my [11:00] mother, and I’d built up chicken business in six
years, because I thought I was settling there. But then this feeling came of all the teachers – after
my husband had planned to get the Master’s at Brown, then came the idea of, well if you’re
going to do college teaching, you have to get a PhD. And so then we sold the chicken farm, and
one year I lived in Providence while he wrote his Master’s thesis, and I did the vocabulary work
and the typing. And for extra money, I went down the hill, and I used to pick up letters at the
banks. They didn’t do enough trade in Spanish then to hire secretaries in Spanish. [12:00] And
then I’d take it back to my apartment and translate it, type it, take it back the next morning, and
they used to pay me a dollar a letter, which was supposed to be pretty good money in those days,
you know, just to translate.

JT: I guess by then you were fluent in Spanish?
AHM: Oh, yes. And then at the end of that year he got his Master’s, and that was in ’28, and so
we went over and we traveled the first summer in Spain.

JT: How many children did you have at this point?
AHM: Two boys. I took them with me. Then I decided, since I wasn’t going to have to work on
the chicken farm or do anything like that, I would gamble on having a girl. And he didn’t like the
idea, because his mother had four boys. Never had a girl. And he was sure that I would have a
25

boy. But I decided I didn’t have any heavy work to do or anything to take up much time,
(laughter) [13:00] so we settled in Tours.

JT: Tours in France?

AHM: Yeah. And he studied at a branch of the University of (inaudible) and I was at home. I
took lessons from a neighbor, who was a well-educated woman, in French. So my boy one day
said, “Yeah, Papa speaks French, but Mama only talks it,” meaning that the father was fluent in
French, and I was just talking it. And she was born over there. I got a girl, and she was born, and
then there was a great mix-up on citizenship because my husband was very unfortunate in getting
citizenship. First, the law was, if you moved over state line, you had to file again to be a citizen.
He moved from Massachusetts to Rhode Island (inaudible). [14:00] He had to file again. Then
we went to Europe, and then while we were in Europe, they passed the law that you could only
visit your mother country. If you visited any other countries, you lost your application. So he
filed again when he got back, and each time he had to serve five years. It was over 15 years
becoming a citizen. And so then, after he finished in June at the University of (inaudible), we
traveled in Italy. Then we came back to the States, and we went right through to Chicago and
settled there. And I remember that it was in the fall, September 1929, and in October the stock
market crashed. (laughter) But I had sold the chicken farm to my brother, who was a very good
businessman, and he paid me regularly [15:00] all through the Depression, which kept the family
going. But first, I took student roomers, and then – at that period, there was too many apartments
empty, and there were so many apartments empty that the University of Chicago paid me at night
just to sit on the first floor in the front window with a sign over it – “Apartments to Rent.” And
people would come in off the street, and I’d show them the apartment. That’s another funny
thing about the change in our life. Who would dare nowadays to take a four-story apartment
house and show strangers who come in off the street at night, all around the building? You know,
you don’t do that now. And then he finally got his PhD, and [16:00] meanwhile he got a job
teaching at DePaul University, first downtown and then out on the main college. And meanwhile
the Depression had deepened. I saw the Depression all around me. It was horrible. My husband
was up to his neck in studying. He wasn’t well. He had ulcers, and he lived in his own room in
an ivory tower. I mean, he didn’t realize. He didn’t know the people that were begging in the
26

stores. He didn’t know the people that came to the door begging through the day, and all of that.
It changed me. It changed me a lot, because I had been in the country, where the last thing you
worried about was something to eat. And to see people that would stand outside of the A&P
asking me for a loaf of bread – you know, [17:00] there was a time they would beg for a dime,
and people would say, “Oh, they’re going to spend it on drink,” you know? But now it was very
serious. And then they came, and people were being evicted. Here we had empty apartments all
over the city, but if people couldn’t pay their rent they were evicted. And then there were men
that were organized, and came and moved the people back into their houses. And then I used to
go to Washington Park with the children every Sunday, and there were groups all over. There
was an injunction. You could say anything you wanted to in Washington Park. So I’d go from
one group to the other to hear the lectures, and I found that these people that were getting the
food and organizing the city – the city broke down completely feeding the people, [18:00]
because we had no welfare programs or anything like that – and the Communist Party was doing
it, so I got very interested. Then, my two boys finished high school and were moving downstate,
but the Depression wasn’t over yet, and we were moving for the boys to go to the state university
in Champaign, Illinois. So we moved downstate, and downstate I joined the Communist Party,
and I organized the city, because Roosevelt had come in, and in Washington they were declaring
all kinds of relief for the people, but Champaign wasn’t giving it. So things got quite hard.
Meanwhile, the war in Spain broke out, and I joined a strong peace movement and was very
active in that all the time. Because I had [19:00] two sons I could see war coming, and of course
they both had to go in the war when it came. But one was in the Navy –

JT: What did that mean when you said you organized Champaign?

AHM: Well, I organized all the unemployed that were begging for help. And there was a welfare
office that didn’t do things for the people. It was mostly in the hands of one woman, and she
couldn’t believe – Champaign, Illinois, at that time, was a farming community, you know? She
couldn’t realize what was happening. She couldn’t understand it. And so we organized people
into [the work of the lines?]. We made a protest to get them – benefits to get them relief. And a
child died of a ruptured appendix because no [20:00] doctor would come, because the woman
had no money to pay them. And right away, the university got involved, and the medical
27

department of the university, the doctors, they said that they must be notified immediately, and
they got after the city, and all that sort of thing. Of course, this made trouble when my husband,
who couldn’t understand it –

JT: Trouble between you and your husband?

AHM: Hmm?

JT: Trouble between you and your husband?

AHM: Oh yeah, and it became very serious. And so he told me that I could choose him or the
Communist Party, so I chose the Communist Party. And I moved to Indianapolis then, because
that was another state. I knew I wouldn’t embarrass him there with my actions, and whatever. So
he went on teaching at DePaul, and he’d visit me in Indianapolis.
JT: Were all your kids older, at least high –

AHM: Hmm?

JT: Were all your kids older by then?
AHM: Oh, yes. And the boys then went into service. One got his Master’s and immediately went
into the Air Corps. The other went in the Navy. But because they had been radical in college,
agitating (inaudible) for peace before we went into war, and so forth... The Army in those days, –
or the government in those days, kept very close records, so one got stuck in Guam during the
whole war, and the other got stuck in Puerto Rico for the whole war. (laughter) And meanwhile
I had continued, and after that, when the war ended, I married – my husband had divorced me.
Then I married an archaeologist from Champaign – or from Columbus, Ohio.

JT: Now, were you still in Indianapolis at this point?

28

AHM: [22:00] Yeah, all through the war. And then when I married the man from Columbus,
Ohio, I moved to Columbus. And there, I became involved with the Progressive Party. And the
Progressive Party had – I’d say the biggest percentage were liberals, but a lot of Communists
were with the Progressive Party. But then Truman was running as the Democrat, and he took
over a whole lot of the programs of the Progressive Party. At least he promised it. And of course,
that took the votes away from the Progressive Party, which, as Communists, we thought was
good, you know? Truman did what we wanted to see done. I think without the Progressive Party
he never would’ve done it. So anyway, by that time I was really involved – and right after the
Progressive Party, of course, Joe McCarthy, the Republican, came down the pike. [23:00] And
the whole policy in Columbus, Ohio, was to break the United Electrical Worker’s Union, which
was very strong, and of course Ohio was an anti-union state at that time. So when they began to
call people in on the State Un-American Committee, they called me in too. Meanwhile, Ohio
State University fired my husband because he married a Communist, so we bought a little farm
on the outside of the town, and I worked in a hospital in nursing, and he worked on the farm.

JT: Oh, were you a nurse at this point?

AHM: I had taken some training in practical nursing, and we were getting On along. And then
the Committee called me in, so [24:00] my husband and I agreed – I was only past 60 by then.
We agreed that somebody had to stop the Committee, and maybe I was (laughter) the one to do
it. So I couldn’t find a lawyer in the whole city. It was a very rough period. They threatened our
lives, and they threatened to burn our property, and all that. So a very young woman who
graduated from Michigan agreed to take the case, and everybody said – I wanted to appeal the
case on grounds of harassment, and a big lawyer said that nobody had ever appealed a case on
that before. And I said that I took the Fifth Amendment, because every question they asked me
they knew the answer for. Then, some time later – Oh, so she began to file, [25:00] and then they
arrested me for contempt of the Committee, and then she filed and began to open the case. And
of course, cases that embarrassed the government, they stall on. They took seven years to enter
The Supreme Court, but she kept at it the whole time, and by golly she won. All the nine old men
decided in my favor.

29

JT: What year was that, then, that it came to the Supreme Court?

AHM: The case ended in 1957. And for her, this was a great feather in her cap, especially a
young woman. She went to the West Co– Oh, her husband divorced her then, because she had
taken a case to defend a Communist.

JT: (laughter)

AHM: It was all politics then. And she went to the West Coast, and she set up the [26:00]
Meiklejohn Library Law School. And she has quite a name now on the West Coast. And
Meiklejohn was long before your time, but he was a very progressive radical, and a professor at
Amherst, who was fired and persecuted before my time, (laughter) but she was a great admirer of
his, so that was the name of it. And she lectures and writes books on law. She has quite a
reputation now. And you know, there are not enough cases in the country. Every lawyer would
like to go to law school – I mean every lawyer would like to go to the Supreme Court, but they
don’t have enough cases, (laughter) and so it’s... She was very glad to get a case of a woman, and
she herself being a woman, and the woman who did the research for her was another lawyer.
[27:00] She was a lawyer for the CIO Union, and she was brought up before the Committee, and
so they stopped all the 22 cases in Ohio while they waited for my case. It was the test case.

JT: Did you have to testify before the Supreme Court?

AHM: Huh?
JT: Did –
AHM: No, I couldn’t – When they had the hearing, I felt I couldn’t afford to pay what I wanted
to pay on the case, so I worked all that day in the hospital. And right in the middle of the hearing,
the prosecuting attorney from Ohio raised a stupid question, so they had to call a recess. My
lawyer had to call me at the hospital and straighten it out. You see, when I married, according to

30

Cuban law, they gave me dual citizenship. But according to the American law in those days, I
lost my [28:00] citizenship. But when I came back five years later, I got my citizenship. I went –

JT: Got it back.
AHM: – just like a foreigner. I went through and got it. And this prosecuting attorney picked up
that one point, and right in the middle of the last day of the hearing, he told the Supreme Court
that I had become a citizen in 1929. He said I became a citizen then. Well, the Supreme Court
jumped to the conclusion, “Where was she born?” And so they called a recess and told – said
that this changed the whole thing. I was foreign born. And my lawyers – I had told her before,
and she didn’t think it was important. She never made a note of it. She never remembered the
detail of that. So she called me long distance and said, “Where were you born?” I said,
“Providence, Rhode Island.” And she – “Well, what’s all this problem about citizenship?” And I
said, “When I went to Cuba in those days, I lost it.” [29:00] You don’t lose it now. Now you’ve
got foreign men marrying American women so that they can get into the country. And so then
she brought it back to them, and they – and then they decided in my favor.
JT: So the verdict meant that you were – it was agreed that you had been harassed?

AHM: Oh, yes.
JT: To have to testify in before the –
AHM: And the Committee felt so guilty that the lawyer resigned, the prosecuting attorney – of
the Council, I should – of the Committee – resigned, and they couldn’t get another lawyer to take
his place, because you could see down the pike that they were going to lose, and a lawyer would
get a bad name that was handling this case. And the politicians that had set up the Committee for
Ohio – as the Ohio Un-American Activities Committee – they tried very hard [30:00] to go on
from there. What happened was that when the hearing came up, I was called, and I knew it was
to get after me because of what I had been doing, and everything that the – because all the Party
leadership was under attack, you know, in other parts of the country. So I wrote a leaflet, and the
31

day I was – had the hearing, the United Electrical Worker’s Union came and they – because they
knew the Committee’s idea was to break the union. So the men came over to the State House,
and they circled the State House and gave out my leaflet, which was a letter to the Committee, an
open letter. And they distributed it to everybody. Well, the newspaper picked it up and printed
the letter, which gave wonderful circulation and explanation. But lots of people who [31:00]
were just – who had no more idea what Marxism was about, or anything – they were just
automatically anti-Communist. And they are today. Look at this film they’re going to give today
– America – you know? The whole thing, you know? I think it’s to prepare the youth
psychologically for war. And Reagan’s dreaming of war, but it isn’t going to come because
there’s such a resistance of the older people who went through this before. They saw it in
Vietnam. They know what’s happening – for your information, Father Drinan got my FBI record
for me.

JT: This is years later?

AHM: Huh?

JT: This is years later?

AHM: Yeah, and I have it now. And there were over 800 pages, just on what they gave me, and
that doesn’t count on what they sorted out. And that began from the time I first went to
Champaign, Illinois [32:00] and worked on the – the very first case I worked on was a protest
against the Nazis. I went to a Chicago demonstration, and the Nazis were allowed to parade on
Division Street, north side. And it got quite rough, and then I thought, “Well I’m strong, I don’t
have to run.” So I stood in the line and I held onto a tree, and the police tried to make me move
away because I was witnessing the way they were treating the Jews on the whole of that street –
Division Street. And I couldn’t do anything with the police. There were so many, and they were
so strong. But every time I saw a policeman hit – and they were so cruel – they hit the Jews right
in the face, and if they knocked their glasses off, [33:00] they stepped on them, see? And when
the women came crying and tried to stop them, they threw the women in the wagons too, you

32

know? And so I wrote down their numbers to be witnessed, see, and then I went back to
Champaign, and I began to organize a protest. And from that day on, all those years, they –

JT: FBI had all your records?
AHM: Yeah, they got the whole record. I couldn’t get any other job. A friend of mine who had
graduated from the University of Illinois in business management, she conducted surveys for
companies from all over the country. Well, Columbus, Ohio, was considered a city that, if you
ate it, or you wore it, or you slept with it – it would sell anywhere. It was an all-American
[34:00] city. And so she had quite an agency that offered – and when she saw my name in the
paper so much attack on me–

[34:11] (break in audio)
AHM: – She knew me through the Progressive Party, and she saw it. She just called me up and
said, “I can give you work,” and she said, “It’s pretty low pay, but I can give you work at any
time.” So I used to go from house to house, and in the record, they admit that they followed me,
and they used to go into the houses after I left and ask the housewife what I talked about. Well, I
used to go in – maybe I was asking, “Did you try chocolate pudding?” you know? “How do you
like the chocolate pudding?” you know? So then I said, “Gee, that’s a nice-looking mantelpiece.
You’ve got on the mantelpiece here. Who is that?” “This is my son, (inaudible).” And I said,
“Where is he?” They said, “He’s in Korea,” and they told me how they worried. I said, “What
are you doing about it?” She said, “What can I do? He’s in the Army.” [35:00] I said, “You can
protest to the president. We shouldn’t be in Korea. What are we doing on that side of the world?”
And they got all of that in the FBI record. [laughs] And I said, “Whoa, What do you know?” The
whole biography is there. And then I went to Mexico on a trip. I’ve been to Mexico several
times. I went to Panama. I thought Reagan would fill the ditch in before I got there, but he didn’t.
(laughter) I got there first. Anyway, and then I went to Puerto Rico. I went to Puerto Rico when
they were having an election, and I thought, “Gee, it would be a good place to make a survey.
How do the real people – the working people – feel about independence?” (laughter) I went all
around –
33

JT: When was this, now? What years?
AHM: That was in the ’70s. Let’s see, ’76, maybe ’78. [36:00] It was an election year down
there, and everybody was talking politics, of course. They would say to me, “Well yeah, but we
look to the United States for our money, you know?” And I would say, “Well, the United States
are making the profit out of – because they have that 10-year law.” For 10 years, they were – any
company that goes in is free of taxes, for 10 years. But instead of building up the business, they
would quit in nine years, move back, rent the buildings, and it goes on and on and on. There’s no
end to it, you know? But I didn’t educate the whole country before (laughter) I got back. I was
on a short vacation.
JT: Anything else you were involved with in the ’60s, ’70s, or – your work, or community work?

AHM: Well, and then I went to Mexico because my husband wanted to see the pyramids in
Mexico. So we rented a house in Chicago. Meanwhile, we moved to Chicago. [37:00] We rented
a house in Chicago, and we went to Mexico with the idea of staying a year, and af– we went in
July. In November, he died quite suddenly. He had an aneurysm, and the doctors had never
diagnosed it. Anyway, he died around six in the morning, and they arrested me because I was
alone in the room when he died, and it was very suspicious. I was living in a small Mexican
hotel, and the woman there did all she could to help me, and after a day they released me, and
then I buried him down there, and then I came home. And then after a year, I – oh, I went to the
Soviet Union with my son, [38:00] and then I came to live with my daughter in Newton
Highlands. She was a nurse and she had three small boys, and they grew up and went to college,
and then I came over to live with my granddaughter, Anne.

JT: Here in Somerville?
AHM: Yeah, and at that time I got – I belonged to the Woman’s International League for Peace
and Freedom, but I also got interested 10 years ago, when they organized Mobilization for
Survival, and I belonged to CP Pax, and I worked for all of them until I developed this glaucoma.
34

I’m having it treated now. So CP Pax sends me work at the house. I don’t go down there
anymore. Well, I’m 92 now. (laughter) It’s kind of more difficult to get around like that,
especially in this kind of weather, you know? So that’s the end [39:00] of the whole thing. I
guess I’ll keep on like this until the end. (laughter)

JT: Well, we can go back over any particular times that you would want to highlight, either
during your time in Cuba, or... You didn’t say much during – I don’t know – after the Supreme
Court verdict. I’m sure – I imagine the whole time during Vietnam – were you an active person
then?

AHM: I was very active during the war in Vietnam, always on protests, marching on
Washington. Well, all my political work has been marching on Washington. My first marches on
Washington from Illinois was against Jim Crow, and Columbus, Ohio was very Jim Crow at that
time. And I know that – I remember the morning that – I remember the day that they – of
Hiroshima, and I was going to talk to a [40:00] sorority house on campus about Jim Crow, but
meanwhile the bomb had gone off, and my husband and I had a discussion with it. And we were
both very, very upset about it. We felt that it was a terrible thing to wipe out so many people in
an open city, and – because we could see through the government’s argument that it ended the
war. And so meanwhile, one of my sons was –under the government – was studying Japanese,
with the idea of jumping into Japan, of course. And he said – And so anyway, I went to the
sorority meeting. When I came into the room, you know, they all said to me, “Anna, have you
heard about the bomb?” And I said, “Oh, that was a horrible, horrible thing. We never should’ve
done it, because we’re so near the end of the war [41:00] right now.” And all those young
people, they jumped on me, so I went home and I said to my husband, “I’m in the doghouse.” He
says, “Why?” I said, “They’re all gung ho for the – they all approve of that.” And time went by,
and so forth, and now you hear it, but – now, I don’t think the States are quite so proud of what
they (laughter) did. But meanwhile, my husband was working on the Jim Crow question, because
Columbus, Ohio was extremely bad at that time. And since then, of course – now, Martin Luther
King came to Chicago while I was there, and that’s when they threw the rock and he fell to his
knees – but he got up again and went on. So then the next week, we decided we’d march to prove
that, by golly, we’re going through that neighborhood and we’re going to carry Martin Luther
35

King’s banners, [42:00] and black and white would run together. (laughter) And oh, it was really
very awful, the way the people came out to cuss us. And they didn’t throw rocks. They didn’t get
– maybe because of the scandal it was when they hit Martin Luther King. So then we marched as
well as the railroad track, and a freight train was coming by and we couldn’t cross the railroad
track. And then the police began to – they said – the police – they sent the police paper – they
sent some big moving van and made us all get in the moving van, and took us back downtown
again. (laughter) It was the most ignominious ending of a march I’d ever been in.

JT: In all your years of political activity, did you ever feel unusual as a woman being so active,
or ever made to feel [43:00] uncomfortable?
AHM: All the – The name of the game is to embarrass a woman. You have to grow a very thick
skin, and you have to learn to wisecrack back and never – I know I was arrested in Columbus,
Ohio, and I hadn’t been so experienced. I hadn’t been arrested before. And a union woman that
was with me, she said that – oh, we picketed a plant that was on strike. It was all black workers,
and they wanted something in the chimney. It was zinc oxide. They wanted something in the
chimney to purify the air so their kids in the village could breathe pure air, and not breathe that
zinc oxide stuff. And we helped them with the picket line all winter long, and then the judge was
going to [44:00] declare an injunction, so we got a group together, and we went out – a dozen of
us – and we made a token picketing. But we didn’t know until we got arrested – one of the
fellows driving the police car, he said, “Oh, did you know that the judge already signed the
injunction?” And we said, “When?” And he said, “I go back to his house this morning at five
o’clock, and he signed it.” See, we counted – he would sign it nine o’clock, and we were going
to break the picket line before nine. Instead of that, they signed it at five, so legally we were
arrested, but it was an unfair way to... (laughter) So we were all in jail overnight, and so forth. It
really shook up the whole city, but it ended the strike, because the scandals [45:00] exposed that
these poor people... And at that period, the Communist Party had sent me word – would I be –
take the chairmanship of the relief Committee to help these black men? These people weren’t
Communists. They were poor rank and file workers. And I thought, the quickest way to raise
money and save their houses – $25 a month – pay for the house insurance and the loans on the
house. And so I went to host there. Every second week, my husband and I gave a party at the
36

house and invited faculty people, and I’d ask them to loan me $100, and then I’d sign it. My
husband said, “Someday this strike’s going to end, and you’re going to find an awfully big bill
there.” I said, “Well, I’ll cross that bridge [46:00] when I come to it.” But the faculty people only
invited the strikers (inaudible), and when they heard the stories about these people had to put up
with, by the time the strike ended they were so sorry for the people that they all cancelled their
(inaudible) as – they felt embarrassed. They were making good money, and these people... And
then a German refugee – who was Jewish, but he was a refugee from Germany – he saw the
paper was [panning on television?] giving him bad publicity, because naturally, the paper was
siding with the men that owned the plant. And it happened that I got a note from him, and he said
to come and see him. I couldn’t imagine why this doctor, in the midst of all my problems, would
want to see me. But I went over, and he said, “I know everything.” He said, “I had to leave
Germany because [47:00] I know everything of what you’re going through.” He said, “I will
treat those people free, but,” he said, “I want you to tell them that when I send them a bill, they
should write me a note and put in it one dollar, and say ‘This was all I can pay now. I will pay
more later.’” He delivered babies, he treated people for pneumonia, and everything else. He was
so good to those people. But I never had contact with him, see, because I didn’t want to hurt him
when people were already attacking me. But the good thing about it all was that my husband was
in complete sympathy with what I was doing, see what I mean? And so I didn’t have that double
feeling at home that I was crossing him, and – anyway...

JT: Which I guess you had more of in your first marriage?
AHM: Yes, and he just couldn’t understand it. I know that if he had – If he had lived [48:00] to
see the change in Cuba –

JT: This is your first husband now?
AHM: My first husband, the Cuban – to see the change in that country – the poorest people and
where they are now, the education they’re getting, the health centers, the baby centers, the
independence of the young women – not only working, but handling their own money – the
rights of the women, you know what I mean? If he could’ve lived to see that, I think he would
37

approve of the revolution now, you know? And the same is true even of the religion. It’s open,
but the church, the Catholic Church is still attacking – one branch of the church. And the other
churches are there, and none of them are – except Jehovah’s Witness – [49:00] and they’ve
(inaudible) out of trouble –
JT: Can I – I just wanted to ask you, in looking back over what we’ve discussed this afternoon –
when you talked about your time at Brown, it sounded like you were very interested in what was
going on in the world around you, but it sounded like it wasn’t till later that you suddenly
became very active. What do you think was the – was there one particular thing that led you to
suddenly become very active?

AHM: The Depression. Seeing people suffer in the Depression, and knowing that we are such a
rich country. And the same thing I feel now. To know that there are people on the street, and to
be in Central Square and see people go through those garbage pails, and pull out a package of
(inaudible) and not know who threw this stuff away, you know what I mean? It’s horrible. And
still, I don’t know, the [50:00] Americans seem to be accepting, you know what I mean, of it. It’s
been like that for some time now, and it doesn’t change in spite of all the struggle, and all that.
And we’re putting all this money – we’re following the path of Germany. We’re putting our
money into the armaments – more and more armaments – and the government doesn’t tell us it’s
dreaming of war, but when you get the 1948 program and you know that the ambition of the
country is to crush the Soviet Union – and what’s the difference in the Soviet Union? The whole
thing is about dollars, about profit. You can’t get profits under Socialism, that’s all. You may get
some [crooked?] politicians, and you have to handle them, but you don’t get a profit system. But
here we’ve got a profit system, and you’ve got a bunch on the top making the money, and the
middle class is getting squeezed. [51:00] But as long as they can possibly pay, they won’t
squawk. And then you’ve got the bottom ladders, and that’s the way it is.
JT: Back in the ’30s, when you started to get very active, was it at all unusual, even within the
leftist movement, for a woman to be as active as you were?

38

AHM: No, leftist women were active. The bourgeois women were still embarrassed for us. The
leftist women – we had picket lines demanding that the – and that sort of thing. And I know that
we had one good committee that was going down to the mayor’s office, and the women said, “I
think we ought to take our children,” because it would show the man that the people are
suffering. And I said, “Yes,” but I said, “I do know this – that as soon –” [52:00] this was Mayor
Daley. I said, “Mayor Daley has a trick, that he closes all the toilets – has them locked.” So I
proposed that we all go to the 10-cent store and buy metal wastebaskets. And we were ready.
They were so shocked. They said, “Oh, we can’t do that,” and I said, “Well, how are you going
to have a picket line in his office?” I said, “As soon as your kids are going to cry they want to go
to the toilet, or a couple women want to go, your line is broken. And that’s it.” And the whole
line fell through just because they didn’t want to think in terms – and I said, “You can go in the
elevator and take a metal wastebasket with you. Will you?” And I said, that’s satisfactory” and
so... (laughter) My second husband was from a very conservative family. He was easily
embarrassed, and sometimes some of the things that [53:00] I would say or go to do – when they
were having the hearings, I wanted to find out – I was running a bookstore, and I had a house I
rented to a Communist organizer, and the mob burned it down, and then the mob threatened to
burn the bookstore. But the bookstore was only two doors from the Salvation Army, and the
Salva– I didn’t know this, but after, afterwards I was told by the neighbors, the Salvation Army –
when you heard on the radio that the house that I owned that was occupied by a Communist
organizer – was my house and had been attacked, then he walked up the street and told
everybody, the men, to come with him and protect the bookstore, because the bookstore –
[laugher] [54:00] it was in a poorish neighborhood. And this wasn’t a radical bookstore with
Marxist books. This was a bookstore that merely had Negro culture. And Carter Woodson, Head
of the Committee of the American Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, the top
culture organization in the country – I had all their publications in my bookstore, for black
people to be able to buy those books, and so – but when the poor women in the neighborhood,
they’d come in and say, “I have to go to the dentist. Can my little boy stay here till I come
back?” I would give him a picture book from the bookstore and sit him at a table to keep him
quiet till she came back. So I had more friends than I knew. And when I sold out on a sale, the
people were awfully upset about it. But I knew that [55:00] the atmosphere had come so in the
city that we were heading deep into the McCarthy period. I knew that you couldn’t even have a
39

bookstore for black people. So that’s what happened. And then I was afraid that this – I rented
the apartment upstairs. I gave it to a couple, and the wife put time into the bookstore when I
wasn’t there. In other words, she earned her rent. And her husband, at night, was – she wanted
her evenings with her children, so at night he used to – he had a rocking chair in the bookstore,
and he kept it open for me till nine o’clock, but he read all the time. He liked to read. He was a
union man. And then I saw the paper. He was going to be a witness against me. And I didn’t
know what he would say, and I thought [56:00] “I can handle myself better if I know what he
said.” So I waited till about five o’clock, when I thought the state office was closed, and I went
down, and there was a very conservative group of women called “Watch Washington,” and I said
to him, “I’m a Watch Washington woman. I come in directly. I want to know what you’re talking
(inaudible) - for a witness.” And an elderly man says, “Oh, sure.” He pulled the whole file out
and gave it to me to read. My heart was in my mouth. And then I thanked him, I read it, and
everything he said was good.

JT: (laughter)
AHM: It wasn’t bad at all. And just when I was leaving the office, I met the lawyer for the
committee, and he was so surprised, and then the next – couple of days later, everybody in the
Party got a lot of – saying [57:00] “Keep away from her. The Party convinced her – she’s
betraying you. She was in the state office.” And of course, the whole thing was just a – the FBI
did it to find me, see? And the games they played were simply scandalous. And of course, in the
middle of the night the telephone would ring, and the people would say, “Are you coming out?
We’re going to burn the place down.” But my husband had it wired so I’d throw one switch, and
the whole chicken farm, the whole farm, was lighted up with bright spotlights, so that if anybody
wanted to come, they had to run a chance that they’re invisible, because we would’ve seen them,
you know? It was very interesting.

JT: Well, were you afraid, though?

AHM: What?

40

JT: Were you afraid?
AHM: Oh, I think they would’ve killed us if they had a chance, because they did in other parts of
the country. Yeah, I’m sure.

JT: [58:00] So you did live under some fear, then?

AHM: Oh yes, because we had no way to protect ourselves, see?. We had No way. And I know
we were into the second floor on the farmhouse – it was a big farmhouse – and we had
remodeled it. There was an apartment upstairs and one downstairs, and I said to my husband, “I
wanted the people to stay here when they find out who we are.” And they stayed and they stayed,
and in spite of a subpoena being served, in spite of the sheriff coming, and all of that harassment.
And then one day the wife says to me, she says, “I’m a Nazarene. I know what persecution
means. I got a religious – You got political persecutions, I got religious.” (laughter) I said, “Well,
misery loves company,” all in the same (inaudible). And so I don’t whether the country will go
through it again or not. I think that there are lots of forces like that, that [59:00] would like to –
you know what I mean. But I don’t know whether they would go that far.
JT: Well, we’re coming to the end of our tape. Unless you have anything to add –
AHM: I don’t.
JT: – we can close up here. It’s been very interesting, and I want to thank you very much.

AHM: It was when [they?] first contacted me with the letter. I had it in my mind that, to be
honest, I’ll tell you who I am and what I’ve done. And that’s my own life. (laughter)
JT: Well, I think it’s been very interesting.
AHM: It’s not – it doesn’t involve my children and my grandchildren. They all think –
everybody thinks –
41

JT: Has their own ideas, yeah.
AHM: I’m just the great-grandmother. (laughter) Who agitated in their spare time, that’s all.

JT: (laughter) Thanks again.
