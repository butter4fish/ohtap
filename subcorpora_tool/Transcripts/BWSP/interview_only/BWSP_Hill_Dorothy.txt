Dorothy Allen Hill: [00:00] (inaudible) in ’28.
Q: Oh, really?
DAH: Nineteen twenty-eight, mm-hmm. (inaudible) University of Rhode Island, (inaudible). But
my uncle and my aunt both (inaudible).
Q: Oh, your aunt?
DAH: And my uncle, mm-hmm.
Q: And when did she graduate?
DAH: Nineteen hundred, and he was 1904.
Q: From Brown?
DAH: Yes, mm-hmm.
Q: And what was her name?
DAH: Mary Hill, (inaudible).
1

Q: (inaudible).
DAH: (inaudible) [Harrison B?] – there was a Harrison [Gray?] and there was a Harrison
[Buckley?], (inaudible).
Q: All right. Well, was there a women’s college at that time?
DAH: Yes, the Women’s College, I think, began in, I think it would be, the 1890s. Not many
classes had graduated before my aunt – perhaps five or six. It was very small.
Q: It must have been a privilege [01:00] (inaudible).
DAH: Yes, I mean, I’m sure she was very proud to be at Brown. They had to (inaudible) classes.
Almost all her classes were on the [men’s campus?]. And the men were not a bit pleased to have
women there, in general. (laughter) They felt sort of unwanted, I think. But the faculty was very
happy (inaudible).
Q: Do you know what she took? (inaudible)?
DAH: She majored in English, but I can’t really tell you anything else.
Q: (inaudible)?
DAH: I don’t think she, it was a fact…She commuted, of course, (inaudible). And I always knew
that she had been there. She had friends and classmates, (inaudible). And she mentioned faculty.
And, of course, by the time my sister and I went.
Q: Oh, really?
DAH: Yes, and my sister started [02:00] in 1924. And so, at least one or two? (inaudible). Other
than the fact that…it may have been partly a joke, but the men always acted as though we were
2

intruders – you know, what were they doing there on the campus? – in her day. Other than that, I
don’t remember her talking too much.
Q: Do you remember that when you were there (inaudible)?
DAH: No, I don’t think so. Unless you had a [woman?] major, you took a class which was very
small. You chose a class that was very small. The classes were all at Pembroke and the faculty
came over there. It was a campus. The dormitories (inaudible). I didn’t live in a dormitory. I also
(inaudible). When you started a major, you might have a seminar with maybe ten people, and so,
we went over to the men’s campus. [03:00] We had no science, which I didn’t have.
Q: Where did you go to high school?
DAH: My first two years, I went to Quincy High School in Massachusetts, and the last two here.
Q: (inaudible)?
DAH: No, no, my father worked first in Washington, then in Quincy, and then came back to
Providence. We all came from ?? but I was away for four years (inaudible).
Q: So how did you go from high school to Brown? How did you decide (inaudible)?
DAH: Well, I guess my father told me from the time I could understand that I was going there.
(laughs)
Q: Oh, really?
DAH: Yes. He refused to go. His father wanted him to go also. He was the first child in the
family, and he wanted to go to business school and start working. And he regretted it all his life.
He was always [04:00] (inaudible). So I can’t remember a time when I didn’t know I was going
there.
3

Q: Really? Did your brother go there, too?
DAH: No, he went to University of Rhode Island. And my sister (inaudible).
Q: I see. And what did it take (inaudible)?
DAH: Well, all you had to do – I think this is true of men, also – if, in high school, you had – I’m
trying to think what the average was. If you had an average of 85 in everything that you had
taken – an all-over average – you were certified by the high school and you didn’t then have to
take exams.
Q: And that’s all it took?
DAH: That’s all it took.
Q: And did you think of (inaudible).
DAH: No, I didn’t even consider it.
Q: So you commuted.
DAH: Yes, mm-hmm.
Q: And how was that?
DAH: That was very good. My father would take us in on the way to the (inaudible), because he
went in down to the city to work. And then he would come home by trolley car. But at least half
of the girls of my class were [05:00] what were called “city girls.” It was very nice. We knew the
dormitory girls, too, but we got to know each other a great deal better than we knew the
dormitory girls. (inaudible) 12 or 13 (inaudible). And because we were city girls, most of us
4

stayed here – not all of us, but a great a many of us stayed here. The ones who didn’t stay here
would be coming home at various times, you see, so that we’ve been able to keep up the
friendships. But when I was a freshman, I think the only buildings were Miller and Metcalf and
then Pembroke Hall and some buildings on Meeting Street that had been maybe two-family
houses or something of that sort, that maybe were used for classrooms. They had lockers in the
basement [06:00] of Pembroke Hall And there was a little lunchroom there. And so, we were in a
very small area.
Q: At Pembroke Hall?
DAH: Yes. And, you know, we knew everybody very well. And then, the library was on the top
floor, and the steps starting there. So that it was a very close group, (inaudible). Also, we had to
go to chapel four days a week. It was (inaudible) chapel. It probably (inaudible). But (inaudible)
they had various people come to speak to us (inaudible).
Q: Oh, really?
DAH: And I can remember when we were allowed – I think in my second year – to smoke on
campus. One of the chaplains (inaudible) polite manner, (laughter) on how to conduct ourselves
(inaudible), and not offending other people [07:00] with the smoke, and putting it out at the end,
and that kind of thing. But the only religious aspect that remained was the fact (inaudible) at the
beginning (inaudible).
Q: (inaudible)?
DAH: No, the name continued, but that was the only way you got to know people. You were
seated alphabetically by class in the chapel. So you got to know those people very well,
(inaudible).
Q: And you were a freshman in 1926?

5

DAH: Yes, mm-hmm.
Q: And what was (inaudible)?
DAH: Well, it was really very pleasant It was very small, and people in Pembroke Hall – you
know, the dean and the other officers there – were always very friendly. The librarian, the
woman who later was called Dean of Students, (inaudible). [08:00] They were all very friendly
and pleasant (inaudible). Of course, being local, I knew some of the people (inaudible). And of
course other people I would have known that were in the city, (inaudible) in the beginning.
Q: How big was your class?
DAH: About a hundred.
Q: (inaudible).
DAH: I think there (inaudible).
Q: And do you remember any of the rules (inaudible)?
DAH: What kind of rules? You mean academic, or social, or. . . ?
Q: Both.
DAH: (inaudible) remember any special academic rules, (inaudible) your class (inaudible). One
thing that rather shocked me, we were always having teas. (laughter) [09:00] That didn’t shock
me, having teas. It was, you know, various groups, clubs and stuff (inaudible). And (inaudible).
(laughter) Like it was a State law or something of that sort.
Q: Well, were they wearing hats?

6

DAH: Yes, so I went back and got my hat, and from then on I knew I had to wear a hat. It just
surprised me. That’s the type of rule that we had that we would find very burdensome. But we
just accepted it.
Q: How was the social life (inaudible)?
DAH: Well, let’s see, I don’t remember. [10:00] I think each class had a special(inaudible) for
the freshman, in the (inaudible) freshman year. Then some member of that class was assigned to
take you to that party And so, then that was someone else that you knew pretty well. Every
freshman was assigned a senior to take care of her, and she was (inaudible) You developed a
special relationship (inaudible). And there also was a French Club, and I suppose the other
language clubs. And the Komians – that was the dramatic society. And when they had plays, the
girls, of course, had to wear men’s clothing to do the men’s parts. (laughter) Same thing was
going on at Brown – the boys were being girls. I can’t remember the other groups. [11:00]
(inaudible) my memory is fading these days, but it seems that there was a great deal… as I say.
And there was always a tea. Every few weeks it was a tea for some group or other.
Q: Did you work at all while you were (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)?
DAH: Let’s see. After my first year, I…college took care of it, you could go and get a part-time
job. I worked in a department store on Saturday afternoons. And I was in the coat department.
And when somebody bought a coat, I wrote out the slip for her. And I think I got a dollar or
something for the afternoon. (laughter)
Q: Oh, really?
DAH: Mm-hmm.
Q: What kind of classes (inaudible)?

7

DAH: Of course we had required classes for the first two years. Then you would have a
bachelor of arts (inaudible). [12:00] And so I remember the first two years (inaudible), in math,
and English, and a language, (inaudible) French (inaudible). And the next year…And the English
was required, and you couldn’t choose which English you wanted to take for the first two years.
It was a year of composition, and half of the first year, and the other half the second year. And
then, the second half of first year was English literature beginning with Beowulf and going
halfway up, and then your sophomore year, you finished that. So you had a survey course of that.
Q: Just to Beowulf?
DAH: No, Beowulf was the very first thing, because he’s practically the first piece of English
literature. Then you came right up to the twentieth century. [13:00] And, [let’s see?], the second
year you had to have history, and that was a survey course (inaudible) history, political science,
and social science. Again, I had, the English was chosen for me. I think I took Italian. I
(inaudible) (couldn’t take?) the Latin (inaudible), English, political science, social science,
Italian, and (inaudible) the other one. Can’t think what it was, though,
Q: (inaudible) English? And then you get to choose?
DAH: Yes, after two years you then began your major at that point, (inaudible). Then, one other
requirement was either philosophy or (inaudible). And I think that (inaudible). [14:00] And after
that, you just chose (inaudible).
Q: How was the studying? How serious (inaudible)?
DAH: I think it was quite serious. Everyone took it seriously. Everybody didn’t go to college
then. Everyone didn’t expect to, and I think we thought it was a privilege. And I had a lot of
respect for the (inaudible).
Q: How as the (inaudible)?

8

DAH: Oh, it was very formal, (inaudible) composition course, then you would probably have to
go to the faculty member’s office, and he would discuss what you had done (inaudible).
(laughter) things like that. At least not with me because I would (inaudible) struggle. (inaudible).
[15:00] We had a little pig – an embryonic pig in formaldehyde. Did you have that?
Q: (inaudible). (laughs)
DAH: I used to spend most of the hour pretending that I couldn’t find it. (laughter)
Q: How do you think most of the people (inaudible) ambitions or outlook for the future that they
had?
DAH: Well, they weren’t too many openings for college graduates. Teaching was the most
(reasonable) thing. And then, when I graduated, the college was pretty new (inaudible). Some of
my friends majored in psychology, and (inaudible). And at least one girl went on to medical
school (inaudible) [16:00] What she needed in college and then (inaudible). I’m trying to think.
You really weren’t prepared for anything. There was nothing vocational about it at all.
Q: (inaudible).
DAH: Yes, mm-hmm.
Q: You said that (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)?
DAH: Yes, mm-hmm.
Q: She had (inaudible).
DAH: Yes, well, this was a woman who – a local woman in Providence who was an artist
(inaudible) and that sort of thing. But there wasn’t anything (inaudible). Just gave us ideas of

9

what fields we might go in probably with graduate work. Sociology was pretty popular, you had
the social worker. Of course, eventually, at least in a few years (inaudible). get a degree.
Q: [17:00] What did you do after (inaudible)?
DAH: I taught school (inaudible).
Q: What kind of school?
DAH: Public high school. I got my first (inaudible). First I had a little history, and I had just that
one history class in college. (laughs)
Q: And you taught history?
DAH: About six different (inaudible) preparations. You know, it was English history, European
history, ancient history, and at that time, there were two semesters (inaudible) public schools,
see? So you had the first semester of ancient and the second semester at the same time in the
same (inaudible). So English history was another thing that I had to teach. [18:00] And
eventually (inaudible).
Q: That was in Providence?
DAH: In East Providence. I started teaching in Connecticut, (inaudible). And, you see,
(inaudible) because the job – I knew I was getting history the first time, and I was very glad to
get it because the Depression (inaudible) and you were very lucky to have a school or a job. The
second year, through Pembroke, I had the opportunity to go to another town in Connecticut to
teach English and French, and French had been my minor. So I was quite pleased, but when I got
there I (inaudible) another teacher was (inaudible) – and that was in the high school – had
requested that she had that, and I was teaching social studies down in junior high (laughter)
which was horrible – just terrible. But then eventually (inaudible).

10

Q: [19:00] (inaudible)?
DAH: Yes, mm-hmm.
Q: (inaudible).
DAH: That was very nice. I (inaudible). I never really liked teaching, because the longer I taught,
the more difficult it really was. Standards were lower constantly(inaudible). And the groups were
divided by IQ, really, and everyone would get some of these really low groups. Then (inaudible)
vocational schools, and (inaudible). And the boys in the vocational school had to take English
and American history and nothing else in the academic (inaudible). So it was a very difficult
thing. (inaudible).
Q: And how did you see Brown changing (inaudible)?
DAH: Well, of course, it became much more [20:00] (inaudible). It was very (inaudible). It was
rather nice because (inaudible), for boys and girls. So you’d get to know them. And, you know, I
don’t think that the student body really changed as far as the students were concerned. In general,
they were there because they wanted to be there, and they enjoyed themselves. The thing about
being in college, at least when I was there – it’s the one time in my life (inaudible) at the John
Hay when everybody has the same outlook. Everybody wants the same thing, and everybody has
very (inaudible) interests. I mean, you may be majoring in science and I in English, but there’s
something (inaudible) interests similar. And then, when you start to work, wherever you go
otherwise, there’s much more diversity.
Q: Yeah –
DAH: You don’t feel [21:00] as safe and secure,as you do… and you can’t talk to people with
the same closeness that you can in a place like college.

11

Q: (inaudible). Do you feel it was pretty (inaudible) the student body, or (overlapping dialogue;
inaudible)?
DAH: Socially, we were not. I mean, all levels of society were there, even then. And some of the
girls were – you know, they were just living on nothing at all. They were out of town and
couldn’t afford to go to the dormitory. They would have a room somewhere, or maybe two or
three of them would get together (inaudible). And they had very, very little, but they thought
what they were doing was worth it.
Q: (inaudible)?
DAH: Yes, mm-hmm. And they had (inaudible). In fact, even when I was working (inaudible).
[22:00] as a student assistant, I don’t think she had enough to eat, really. She was (inaudible).
But I don’t think there were (inaudible).
Q: Yeah, that’s interesting. You were there when the Depression started.
DAH: Yes, in 1929 the crash came, I believe.
Q: How did that affect you?
DAH: Well, not in college, you know? I think the effect (inaudible). And if you had money in
the stock market, well, you felt it very badly. But the average person didn’t have that. The only
thing was, it was very difficult to get a job..
Q: Did you see (inaudible)?
DAH: Well, some of them [23:00] were (inaudible). You would say they were overqualified for
it (inaudible). They would do what they could, what they could get, especially (inaudible). They
didn’t have any cash.

12

Q: I know a lot of students now feel that being at Brown is like being shut off from the rest of the
world.(inaudible).
DAH: Well, we liked it, I think. (laughter) It is, really. But [you do?] have that experience [again
probably?]. So if you like it, it’s good. (laughter)
Q: What did your father do?
DAH: He worked in the Veterans Administration, (inaudible) manager of the Providence office
of the Veterans Administration.
Q: Mm-hmm. And your mother?
DAH: [24:00] Well, my mother didn’t work. She died when she was [42?] (inaudible).
Q: Did either of them go to college?
DAH: (inaudible), no. (inaudible).
Q: Oh, that’s [really interesting?].
DAH: (inaudible) [afternoon?] at the Veterans Administration, who took all the law courses that
would be necessary for a law degree. Of course, he needed that in his work but he never did
(inaudible).
Q: You mentioned the separation between dorm girls and the city girls. What other ways was
there (inaudible)?
DAH: Well, it was just that you didn’t know them as well. We knew them. In fact, some dorm
girls and city girls became very close if they happened to be associated [25:00] in the same
classes and that kind of thing. In fact, one of my best friends, who came from Woonsocket,
13

started as a city girl. And then, after the first year she lived in the dorm, because that was
(inaudible). I don’t think there was ever any hostility. In general, in our class, more of the city
girls (inaudible) and more active than the dormitory girls and I don’t know why that was.
Q: This is kind of a vague question, but what do you remember about the ’20s?
DAH: Well, I suppose it was before the Depression, and that people [26:00] wouldn’t have real
trouble finding work. There really wasn’t (inaudible). I suppose we had the last year after the
crash, and I can’t think of any differences in our life during that time. The differences really
(inaudible).
Q: Yeah, yeah, no, that’s fine. (laughter) That’s more than fine. What about being in a women’s
college? How did you feel about Pembroke (inaudible)?
DAH: It was called the Women’s College in Brown University. My sister was – it was
Thanksgiving, and she hadn’t worn her college ring in years, but she had it on for some reason
and it said WC (inaudible). And I think [27:00] mine was the first class that was Pembroke, who
graduated from [Pembroke?].
Q: Oh, really?
DAH: I think so, [if you think?]. Because it wasn’t any real difference in the institution, it was
just that they didn’t like Women’s College in Brown University too much.(inaudible).
Q: What about compared to other women’s colleges?
DAH: I didn’t know too much about other women’s colleges. But I think one thing I noticed in
the college as compared to high school, when it came to electing officers or appointing girls to
do things and so on, it seemed that it wasn’t just the pretty girls who got all the votes, but the one
who was really capable.

14

Q: Yeah, that was a (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)?
DAH: It was a different kind of leadership from the high-school leadership. It was very obvious,
yes, mm-hmm.
Q: [28:00] That’s nice. What about a comparison to Brown? Was there a feeling of being at
Pembroke as opposed to Brown?
DAH: I don’t know how they felt at Brown. I mean, I couldn’t answer that, because they had
fraternities and, you know, that was a different kind of (inaudible), maybe a sacrifice that we
didn’t have.(inaudible). It was larger, also. So ours was so small that everybody knew
everybody, and upper classmen knew lower classmen – we were all …we knew all of them well,
and (inaudible).
Q: Everybody knew each other?
DAH: Everybody knew each other, and had more or less common interest and [29:00] common,
sort of, ambitions. Not the same field, necessarily, but they had that. And they were because they
had come (inaudible) educated (inaudible).
Q: And do you think that most people were able to give (inaudible)?
DAH: They were eventually. As I said, some of them had to take what they could, including me.
(laughter) And it perhaps took a while, but most of them did eventually (inaudible).
Q: (inaudible)?
DAH: I did wind up at the library. And I suppose it was those years in high school, I would often
have classes that were [rewarding?]. But I never had all of (inaudible). There were always some
troubles every day, (inaudible) –

15

Q: (inaudible)?
DAH: What did you say?
Q: They weren’t Pembroke?
DAH: No, no, not at Pembroke. This was when [30:00] I was in the [library? [, but when I was
teaching high school, you see? There were always some bad moments in the day that I dreaded.
(laughs) (inaudible)
Q: Yeah, I always wondered how it was for the teacher. (laughter)
DAH: Sometimes it’s horrible. The last time I was teaching, they were lowering standards
constantly for the people in the lower grades. And I was teaching English written at a 5th-grade
level for 12th-grade students. And that was really (overlapping dialogue; inaudible).
Q: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible).
DAH: Yes, let’s just say you’d have the classics, Dickens’s Great Expectations (inaudible)
vocabulary, (inaudible) might be difficult to understand. And that was what we (inaudible), 12th–
grade (inaudible) –
(break in audio)

Track 2
Q: [00:00] (inaudible) in past years by alumni about how it was to have black students at
Pembroke. Were there black students that were (inaudible)?
DAH: I think there was one in every class.
16

Q: Just one?
DAH: Just about one in every class, mm-hmm. And they were not allowed to go to social
functions.
Q: Any of them?
DAH: No, well, I guess I should say they were not allowed to go to dances, because they didn’t
feel that white girls should dance with a black boy or see a black male (inaudible).
Q: And did you know [01:00] any (inaudible)?
DAH: Well, I said there was one in every class. I think there wasn’t one in our class. Well, I
didn’t know them well. They sort of stayed together, and you could hardly blame them in that
sort of atmosphere. But I did know them, and I don’t think anyone in Pembroke was rude to
them. It was just that there was that very bad feeling about socializing. I mean, I suppose the
black girls had more freedom than the white girls, afraid of being too (inaudible).
Q: Yeah, that’s interesting. Did you know Dean Morriss?
DAH: Not well. (laughter) She was a little hard to know, I think.
Q: What was your impression of her?
DAH: Well, she was very – what should I say? She looked very much the dean, and acted the
dean. And if you were a [02:00] member of the Question Club – that was the president of all the
clubs plus, I guess, class presidents (inaudible), she entertained you at least once a semester
(inaudible).
Q: Oh, really?
17

DAH: Yes. They were in Connecticut.
Q: And were you in that club?
DAH: No, I was not the president of a club or president of the (inaudible). So she was a little
hard to know, I think. She made very good appearances, looked just like a dean and acted just
like a dean. (laughter) I think that she had come from a woman’s college (inaudible). But she
was somewhere else first, and I think it was more in a class with Wellesley and Smith or one of
those. I don’t think she felt quite at ease with all of us.
Q: Really?
DAH: We had all kinds of people, (inaudible), I mean, from all levels of society.
Q: Do you feel that Pembroke was different [03:00] in that way from a lot of the outstanding
women’s schools?
DAH: Yes, I think so, maybe because it was a city, you see? And it was possible for some of
these city girls [to go?]. They couldn’t have afforded to go to Wellesley or Wheaton or Smith or
any of those.
Q: Was there competition between the women’s colleges at that time?
DAH: Athletic competition?
Q: Any – yeah.
A Yes, there was that. I can’t think of any other though(inaudible).

18

Q: Did you ever see people from other schools? Were there functions with (overlapping
dialogue; inaudible)?
DAH: No, I was never in any of the athletics. And my friends who were, I think, did see groups
from other schools, women’s colleges. (inaudible).
Q: You had gym requirements?
DAH: Yes, it was at least two years, maybe more. I think it was three years. (laughter)
Q: And you didn’t like it?
DAH: Not especially, no. [04:00] It was a nuisance.
Q: Do you remember who was president of Brown during that time?
DAH: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) Well, he must have been there the first year, I think.
And at the beginning of my sophomore year, Clarence Barbour became the president.
Q: And then, he was president until (inaudible).
DAH: I guess so. You see, the Brown charter stipulated that the president of Brown had to be a
Baptist minister. He became a Baptist minister. And this started when (inaudible) came in.
Q: That was still true? I never knew (overlapping dialogue; inaudible).
DAH: Yes, that thing had never been changed. And Clarence Barbour was an ordained Baptist
minister. But I guess member of the Corporation changed that. However, it took a while. I mean,
this was the story I always heard. [05:00] And they knew that he would have to retire in about
three or four years, and in that period they changed the charter. And then Henry Wriston was
certainly no Baptist minister. (laughter) He was a very strong president.
19

Q: Was he?
DAH: Hmm-mm
Q: Did you have close contact with Pembroke after you left?
DAH: Well, yes, I don’t know how close you would call it, because I was away for a couple of
years. But then, when I came back, we had a Pembroke (inaudible). And I always came to
reunions, because I was so close by (inaudible). As I said, my friends are almost all – well, my
close friends from way back (inaudible).
Q: So (inaudible).
DAH: And still, yes, mm-hmm.
Q: (inaudible) do you have any outstanding memories, things that you tell? Any stories
(inaudible) things of that sort?
DAH: [I don’t think so?].
Q: [06:00] (inaudible). How many of your class would you say married?
DAH: It’s hard to say. Most of my friends were married, certainly. I was the only one who
wasn’t (inaudible). I think I’m the only one out of, say, 12 or 13 girls who didn’t marry. (laughs)
And I think that was pretty generally true of the whole class. When I think of reunions, most of
them come with husbands.
Q: And of that period?
DAH: Yes, mm-hmm.
20

Q: That generally (inaudible).
DAH: [Yes?], a lot of them married Brown boys, of course.
Q: Oh, really?
DAH: Yes, quite a few, mm-hmm.
Q: And do you feel that as many Brown men have stayed around Providence from that time
period?
DAH: I don’t think so. [07:00] There are still a good many around in various parts of the state,
but I think they had more job opportunities to go out of the state at that time. One of my friends
married a Brown boy who worked for [Ethel?] Corporation. And, of course, they were here
maybe two years, and then they were all over the country. And this is the kind of opportunity the
men had, which the girls really didn’t have. It wasn’t common, certainly, for girls (inaudible).
Q: What kind of association did you personally have with the Brown campus? Were (inaudible)?
DAH: You mean while I was there?
Q: Mm-hmm.
DAH: Or (inaudible).
Q: Well, with the Brown campus, as I said, we’d have to go over for some classes and so on. But
I can’t remember any rules that were bothersome.
DAH: I had heard things such as having to wear gloves [08:00] and hats (inaudible).

21

Q: Oh, yes, well, I don’t remember being told, as I said, over tea. (laughter) But I don’t
remember having to wear gloves when we were on the campus, but maybe (inaudible).
DAH: Maybe that was earlier.
Q: Maybe it was earlier.
DAH: Yeah, mm-hmm. And I remember, we didn’t wear hats in the dead of winter, at least for
the first year or so. And then I think hats came back in.
Q: It was unfashionable?, (inaudible)?
DAH: Yes, to wear hats. Mm-hmm. And then, by the mid-’30s, hats were very, very important.
Q: (laughs)
(break in audio)
Q: [09:00] OK, what did you think of the merger, when Brown and Pembroke merged?
DAH: Oh, I didn’t like it, because it seemed to me that we had the best of the both worlds. See,
we had the campus and faculty and so on, and we had that closeness, and the opportunity to
make lasting friendships and so on. And we liked having our own officers in the class, and
having own little groups, our own little clubs. Although, you know, as time went on the girls
were more and more on the Pembroke campus. They were much more so than we were. In fact,
during the war, I think that was the time when the classes merged, because the faculty and the
students were going off to the war, and they really couldn’t afford to run one class at Pembroke
and a duplicate a Brown. [10:00] And so, they pretty much came together in the ’40s.
Q: They did that before?

22

DAH: No, during the ’40s, during the war.
Q: Mm-hmm. And then, the merger in [1968?].
DAH: Yes, then that. But they still had their own class officers, I think, even though they were
merged in academic classes. And, of course, they own(inaudible) campus and their own
dormitories. And it’s very hard for me to say whether it’s good or bad, because I’m not
experiencing it. But we liked what we had so much that were sorry to lose the identity of
Pembroke.
Q: Do you think that was the general feeling?
DAH: Yes, among the women it was.
Q: Alumnae?
DAH: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I don’t know about the men.
Q: What kind of changes have you noticed in the campus, (inaudible)? [11:00] Going back, what
kind of things strike you as being (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)?
DAH: Well, the things that strike us, I think are the fact that – I suppose because the buildings
are always open, they’re not closed at certain hours and so on, there’s been so much vandalism
and destruction and deterioration of the furnishings.
Q: Oh, really?
DAH: Yes, especially in a place like Alumnae Hall. Of course, I know it’s very old now, but the
furnishings are not well taken care of. That’s true of dormitories, too.
Q: Very true.
23

DAH: The fact that anyone could walk in at almost any hour of the day or night, not necessarily
students (inaudible).
Q: What kind of (inaudible) women at that time?
DAH: Well, Miller and Metcalf, they were individual rooms, not large. And they had the –
Q: Singles?
DAH: Yes, mm-hmm.
Q: Oh, really?
DAH: [12:00] They were singles (inaudible). Sharpe House – my sister did live in the dormitory
in the first year, because we were in Massachusetts at that point, and she lived in Sharpe House. I
can’t think what that is now. That’s on Angell Street. It was, I guess, a double, private house. It’s
right near Brown, not very far from Brown. And it’s been so many different things I can’t
remember. That, of course, had been a house, and so they had double rooms there, because of
that was quite large. But the dormitories they built were singles. And, of course, there were no
private baths (inaudible).
Q: She lived in Sharpe House?
DAH: Yes.
Q: What did she think of it?
DAH: Oh, she loved it.
Q: Really? (inaudible) decided to move out (inaudible)?
24

DAH: Well, when we moved up here, my father, I guess, decided that she didn’t need to stay in
the dormitory, so that was (inaudible).
Q: Was it more expensive?
DAH: Yes. Well, of course, you didn’t pay for anything except for your tuition when you were a
city girl.
Q: [13:00] Mm-hmm, I see. What kind of traditions do you remember?
DAH: Traditions? Of course, some of them would be considered very silly now. There was May
Day (inaudible).
Q: I don’t think that’s silly at all. I wish they (inaudible).
DAH: Everybody – you must have heard about the May Queen and. . . ?
Q: No.
DAH: No? It was a day in May when, before that, a member of the senior class was elected as
the May Queen, and then she had a court. And there was a court jester, which was some girl
dressed up like a boy (laughter) and walked around. And she had maids of honor, I think. And
then, a masque was presented by the sophomore class. Someone in the class wrote the masque,
and then there were all these fancy costumes you’d see, and so on. And –
Q: The masque was on May Day (inaudible)?
DAH: Yes, that was the entertainment for the May Queen. And it seems to me that every
freshman [14:00] had to give her senior a May basket. I rather think she did. (laughter) I’m not

25

clear about that. Yes, this was held outdoors, you see? It was very pretty. That was one of the
traditions. I don’t know if I can think of anything else we did (inaudible).
Q: Did you have a freshman sister when you were a senior?
DAH: Yes, I did, mm-hmm.
Q: Have you kept in touch?
DAH: No, she was a dormitory girl. And I don’t think I ever heard from her after she left
Pembroke.
Q: Oh, really?
DAH: Mm-hmm.
Q: How were the students treated by the administration? (inaudible)?
DAH: Were they (inaudible)?
Q: Yeah,.
DAH: I don’t think anyone thought that she was ill-treated at all by the administration or the
faculty. It was really different from high school, and very much better. [15:00] You were treated
really as an adult. I don’t remember anyone having a serious complaint about that.
Q: Mm-hmm. I’ve heard and read, just in going back through the archives and things, about the
definition of a real lady. What would you say the definition of a real lady would be?
DAH: Oh, I don’t know that that was every discussed. (laughter) Because the definition of a lady
in the ’20s and ’30s was very different from what it would be now, I think.
26

Q: Uh-huh. How?
DAH: Well, let’s see, I think of my grandmother chiefly. She was, of course, quite oldfashioned. And, of course, you had to be very careful of your language, and always be very
clean, and never go out without a handkerchief – you know, a real handkerchief, that sort of
thing. [16:00] And I’m trying to think. I can just picture her, but I can’t think the things she’d
correct us all on. (laughter) If you did something that she didn’t like, she’d say, “That is not
pretty. ” (laughter) You were supposed to always be very careful in your speech and your
actions. But I don’t think there’s such a thing as a definition of a lady on the campus now, is
there? Does anyone worry about that?
Q: No, I don’t think so.
DAH: Well, I don’t think they did, particularly, in my day. I’m thinking back to my
grandmother, who was a generation back, you see?
Q: Where was your grandmother born?
DAH: She lived around here.
Q: From Rhode Island?
DAH: Mm-hmm.
Q: (inaudible). I see. Did you ever feel that you were discriminated against because you were
from Pembroke, or because you were a woman?(overlapping dialogue; inaudible)?
DAH: [17:00] Oh, no. No, not at all.
Q: No? Not at all?
27

DAH: No, the faculty was really very, very good to us – very friendly, very (inaudible).
Q: Mm-hmm. Let me see. What happened when the war came?
DAH: You mean in ’41? Well, of course, I wasn’t at Pembroke then, you see?
Q: You weren’t around Brown?
DAH: Oh, no, I did come back and take a master’s degree, but that was in 1953. So, during that
period I did go to Pembroke for various social functions, but it didn’t affect me really, as far as
Pembroke was concerned – the war didn’t. I know it did to the girls who were there, and the boys
too. It was very different [18:00] at that time, during the war. But I really (inaudible).
Q: (inaudible). Who was your favorite teacher (inaudible)?
DAH: I’m trying to think. (inaudible), I liked Professor Hastings very much. He was (inaudible),
and he taught in such a way that – he taught it really through the language of Shakespeare, so
that having once the vocabulary, I should say, that the difference in meanings in Shakespeare’s
vocabulary now, so that after that, you could read any play of Shakespeare’s and understand it a
great deal better, (inaudible). [19:00] I used (inaudible) his teaching. I couldn’t say that I disliked
any of them. I disliked some subjects, but the people always seemed to be quite pleasant in spite
of that. I had a woman we called Madame Landre. She came from France, she and her husband.
And they both taught French. And she was a very, very friendly, pleasant person.
Q: She came from France?
DAH: Yes, mm-hmm, (inaudible).
Q: So, looking back, when you were at Pembroke, do you think there’s anything you would
change if you could about. . . ?
28

DAH: No, I can’t think of (overlapping dialogue; inaudible). You know, it’s so long ago that it
looks better probably every year now. [20:00] And I can think of nothing. Maybe I would have
after I had just been there, or while I was there, but I can’t think of any. . . But you see, my
generation was not expected to be rebellious. We didn’t think of it.
Q: Oh, sure, yeah.
DAH: It didn’t occur to us to feel that we were not treated well, and so on, or that we should
determine the rules of the college or the academic rules. We would think that was (inaudible).
Q: Was there any movement towards change while you were there, by the students, do you feel?
Any (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)?
DAH: No, I can’t remember anything. O course when I talked with my aunt, she was very
surprised at the changes that had occurred in the 26 years since she had been there. She felt that
we had a great deal more freedom and many more privileges [21:00] and so on.
Q: It was very strict while she was here?
DAH: Yes, well, it was very small, and so, naturally, there was less social life. It was (inaudible)
organized than we were. (inaudible)
Q: And how many were there, there, when she was?
DAH: I’m really not sure. The class of 1900 might have had maybe 25 or 30 girls? I’m not sure.
I should know that, but (inaudible).
Q: That’s fine. (laughs) Do you remember any of the other changes that she talked about? I’m
just fascinated.

29

DAH: Of course, we had many more choices of courses that we could take than they had, I think.
Professors came over to Pembroke and taught the girls, and I think some of the professors didn’t
care to, and didn’t come over. And that alone would limit the choices [22:00] of courses
(inaudible).
Q: Mm-hmm. Didn’t care to come over to Pembroke?
DAH: Mm-hmm, (inaudible).
Q: It was their own choice?
DAH: I think so, mm-hmm. And, of course, they didn’t have very much social life. And I don’t
know if there was any dormitory. If people came from out of town, they probably had to find a
place to stay. So that would make it less (inaudible). But I know she liked going there. She
(inaudible). Because in those days, you certainly didn’t go unless you really wanted to.
Q: How did she qualify (inaudible)?
DAH: I don’t know. I don’t think they had certification (inaudible). Things like that, I have lots
of things I wonder about now, but when these people were living it didn’t occur to me to ask
questions.
Q: Yeah, yeah. (laughs) And that’s just like, after this is over, [23:00] I’m sure I’m going to think
of a billion more questions I wanted to ask. OK, well, I think I’ll let you go now.
DAH: OK.
Q: Thank you very much.
DAH: You’re welcome. I don’t know that I was very helpful to you at all, but. . .

30

Q: Oh, it was wonderful.
