Louise Newman: This is Louise M. Newman in an interview with Polly Welts Kaufman
on February 9, 1988 at the John Hay Library. Shall we start by just having you, urn,
summarize briefly the items that we've got under the "Short Biography"? So, tell us a
little bit about your background, why you came to Pembroke College?
Polly Welts Kaufman: Okay, uh, I entered, uh, Pembroke in 1947. Uh, the reason that I
came was really, really interesting. I was brought up in Haverhill, Massachusetts, which
is really a country town. It's a small city, but it's a country town. And, my family felt
that I should have, that I should go to a, should have some experience in a city, that I was
a little provincial. So, my mother had gone to Smith College, and I would not even look at
it because I wanted to go to a college where there were also men. I also got really tired of
all of her friends, talking about how wonderful Smith College was because they'd have the
Merrimack Valley Smith Club meetings and so I just, in order to be independent, refused
to do that. So, it was decided that I'd go to Radcliffe, and I went for my interview. We
didn't have very much money, 00, because my father's business was not doing well and it
did fail, in fact, when I was in college. And, so, urn, we went to Radcliffe for the
interview when I was a junior in high school, that's Haverhill High School, and they said
to me that I would have to live at home because I lived thirty miles from Radcliffe and so
I walked out of the interview and said that, "I won't apply then," [laughs] because I
wanted to go away. So, a, 00, one of my English teachers at Haverhill High School said,
"Have you ever thought about going to Brown? Urn, we've just had a student go there a
couple of years ago and she has really liked it." And, it was sixty miles away from home
and I thought, "That's really going away from home, that sounds like a good idea to me."
And, of course, they had men too. It was also cheaper than some places because we
probably had an old catalogue, so it seemed like a good place. So, we came down for an
interview, and, my mother and I came down for an interview on the train, and I don't
think we even had a car at that time, and it really seemed to feel like a real university and a
real city to me. And, it also seemed far away. Rhode Island seemed very different from
Boston, which was the only city I knew, and so I thought, "This is really going away."
And, so I only applied here. Uh, I made up my decision to come here. I only applied
here and did get a scholarship. It's interesting what it cost. I got a $300 scholarship a
year. I earned $300 a year, first at the John Hay Library, and then later on I found it was
more remunerative to work in the dining hall so I waited on tables instead. My mother
had $300 a year saved from her father's, 00, her late father's insurance, 00, money, and I
had $300 a year that I earned working in the Haverhill Public Library in the summer. So,
it was $1200 a year that I put together, and I did have a loan of about a $1000 when I
finished. Uh, I never had any spending money. Other people would go to the Gate,

which was opened eventually while I was here, but I never ever thought of spending
anything on anything like that. Uh, but, it was fine, I was perfectly happy, and it worked
very well for me. I mean, you can't put yourself through college now, but you could do it
then.

PK: Uh, I, somebody mentioned that I might want to go to a normal school, because I
always knew I wanted to be a teacher, and, 00, but I didn't want to be an elementary
school teacher, so I didn't think of it. And, my family didn't either. They definitely
wanted me to go to a place on, on the level that my mother had gone to. When I got here,
I came to East House, which is right on the present Pembroke campus, where the seal is
on the steps that go up to Alumnae Hall, the outside steps and that was where East
House was. And, that was a wonderful place to be because it was right in the center of
the campus. And, in those days, 00, the people that you met in your freshman dorm,
you knew all your life. And, I still know some of those people that were in East House
with me. My roommate was from Wilmington, Delaware and I thought she was very
sophisticated. And, she thought I was a real country person because I found out later, in
fact it was only about ten years ago at one of my reunions. Her husband came up to me
and I happened to mention that my daughter was studying dance at Sarah Lawrence and
he looked at me and he said, "Your daughter is at Sarah Lawrence?" And, I said, "Well,
what's so strange about that?" And, he said, "Why, I always thought that you were a
real hick! [laughs] And, it doesn't seem to me that you could ever have a daughter that
would do that." So, I probably had a very strong New England accent and, 00, was
looked upon probably by people, from, from country people.

PK: Not at all, because I had other friends who were like me. There were lots of people
that came from my same background. Another thing I remember from my freshman dorm,
I was raised in a Republican family. I was converted to a Democrat by Professor Hedges
by about my sophomore year. He taught u.S. history and became a democrat and there's
never, I've always been a liberal ever since. Urn, but, I met my first Democrat in that
freshman dorm. Her name was Peggy Conant and she came from Washington, D.C., and
she was a Democrat, and she was in fact a regular, ordinary person. And, I remember
being so surprised at that. She later became my roommate and I visited her in
Washington, which to me was a very big distance. And, also visited another person from,
00, Anne Houghton, who was also in East House, 00, in New York City a couple times.
Well, she actually lived up the Hudson but we went to the city and I found that extremely

exciting. So, it really was very broadening for someone who. I lived, Haverhill is in
northern Massachusetts, one mile from the New Hampshire border. And, we went to
Maine in the summer. So, I had only been in three states before I came to Rhode Island.
But, remember, it was right after the War, 00, so people didn't have cars during the War,
and then before that was the Depression, so it happened to be a period in time. I
wouldn't be surprised if I thought about it that my mother had been more traveled
perhaps than I had been.
LN: Did, urn, your mother continue, do anything, what did she do after college before she
got married?
PK: Urn, she was a Twenties person, a roaring Twenties person. Uh, she, 00, after she
graduated from college, she went to Katie Gibbs and she worked at Harvard in the
Admissions Office. She met my father in a boarding house in Cambridge. He had come
from Maine. He was the son of a potato farmer who'd run away to sea and then, all
kinds of things, 00, and finally ended up in Boston. And, they met because they were
each reading Anna Karenina and each had it under their arm - this, this is the story - as
they walked into this boarding house in Cambridge and so they had an intellectual
interest. But, she was an intellectual. She, 00, was one of these really speed readers and
she read three or four books a week all her life and, 00, became a "birder." Uh, very
interested in that kind of stuff and was a very stimulating mother to have. Uh, certainly
guided my reading as a child, 00, would never tell the end. You know, I'd sit there in tears
over something like Little Women, but I wasn't, she would never, never tell me how it
was going to end, although I would plead with her [laughs].

PK: She didn't work at all after she was married and, 00, she, 00, 00, lived a really kind
of genteel life. Uh, they had moved back to the family homestead in Haverhill. My
grandfather was a patent lawyer.

PK: My mother's father was a patent lawyer and had, 00, been to Worcester Tech and
read law in Washington, D.C., so my grandmother actually had a more cosmopolitan
bringing up than I did. And, 00, my grandmother founded the first woman's city club and
was, I was, people often thought I reminded them of my grandmother, but not my
mother. My mother, the only thing my mother ever did for political action was to carry
birth control petitions.

PK: And, uh, so she lived a fairly genteel life and did not go back to work until my father
died. He died young, uh, when I was about 23, and she went back to work then at
Bradford Junior College, doing the same kind of thing, only in the Alumnae Office.
LN: Hm, did, urn, did, was there any discussion as you were growing up or just before
you came to college about what you would do with your life after college?
PK: I knew I was going to be a teacher from the time I was in the second grade, so there
was no problem, and that probably made it easy for them to send me to college because
you had to go to college to be a teacher. I was raised with three boys, and that's
important. I had one brother and two cousins and they had all come home because of the
Depression. It was my mother's sister and, who had the two boys, and so everybody
had come hometo the, my grandfather's house and so I was kind of raised, I've always
felt, a little bit in the nineteenth century because my grandfather was always there. My
grandmother had died by this time.

PK: Right, but I definitely had those values. I had them stronger than my mother who
was a real Twenties rebel. She smoked and drank all her life and I didn't do either
[laughs].
LN: Huh, and you had no female cousins around, it was just you and your mother, the
only women in the?
PK: No, there were no females in my generation. I was the only female in my generation,
and so I do believe that it made me realize that men were not smarter than women because
I was smarter than my three siblings and in school, and so I never had the problem of
thinking that men were smarter than women.
LN: What about the relationship between your mother and father. Were they intellectual
equals? Did you see them that way?
PK: I think so. My father was very creative. Vh, he was, and he was also very
handsome. So, he was always, uh, trying out new things. He was a photographer, and
write, he was a writer and he started a business and all this stuff. But, he eventually
ended up doing advertising and he was really a very creative person. And, I think that it
was a stimulating, a good match.

PK: We had a maid, my grandfather had hired a maid for $20 a month, a live-in maid. Uh,
that was before the War, and I alwllYs minded that and vowed that when I kept my own
house, I would have a small house that I could keep myself and I did in fact do that. Urn,
the, 00, 00.

PK: I felt that it was just a very uncomfortable situation. We always helped.
Everybody helped. My mother helped, and so forth, but it just seemed like a very
uncomfortable situation. I never, never liked it.

PK: Local girls, French or Irish. And, 00, actually, what happened was that they would
come for a couple of years and be really trained and then they would go off and do other
things. And, we always sort of kept up with them afterwards. They were kind of friends
of the family.

PK: Well, see, I was, I was, this was before I was eleven. So, I was a kid, and they were
older.

PK: Only until I was eleven or twelve. And, then, nobody had, I mean, that was a, a
different lifestyle.

PK: A smaller family, and then my brother went off to war, so all of a sudden there was
just my mother and father and myself. So, from a large family I was put down to a little
family. And, so I got a dog and I have always had a dog ever since [laughs].
LN: Urn, what were, you mentioned that your father had a business - what was the
business?
PK: Well, at that point, it was Grippit Paper Cement, which still survives. It's a rubber
cement. And, when it went out of business, I was a sophomore in college. Uh, so it'
bankrupt, went bankrupt. And, 00, I don't really know how I managed to continue but I
had that "put together" method and then he did get a job with Dewey and Almy Chemical
Company, who had supplied the material, and so he did have about five or six years of, of
comfort, working for a company. And, they bought a car and they had a lovely time.

PK: He went to Bowdoin for a year, during his time when he was running around, going
to the war and going to sea and all that stuff. And, he got an A in English because his
autobiography was so dramatic and he flunked everything else [laughs].

PK: He, his, he, 00, he was just a really creative kind of a person who couldn't settle
down to do that kind of thing.

PK: I think he knew I wanted to be a teacher and that was probably a good thing. My
brother went to Worcester Tech and became an engineer.

PK: And, the cousins, 00, well, one of them went to, 00,00, Agricultural school and did
some work with farms for a while and ended up selling insurance, and then, the other one
went, 00, became a chemical engineer. So, they were instrumental, college was
instrumental in away. Vh, my mother was a real liberal arts person, but it was expected
that I would teach.

LN: Did you have visions of combining it with marriage, when you were in college, that
is?

PK: No, I never had that problem. I think it was because I, I always needed money. Vh,
it's really been a theme in my life and, 00, so that I always felt that I was going to have to
work somehow.
LN: That you would provide that money then, you wouldn't be getting from other
people.
PK: Part of it, part of it, yup. I always had that feeling that I had to look out for myself,
and that's probably the result of being a little child during the Depression, and maybe

having my father's business fail, I don't know. But, I always knew that I really did have
to think about myself.

PK: Oh, no, I was so excited. I loved it. I always loved it and, 00, could hardly wait to
get back in the fall.

PK: I majored in American Civilization. I started off in Math and I hit the wall, 00, with
Integral Calculus because I had a teacher from Reykjavik, who did not really speak
English very well. And, I couldn't understand him and I didn't assert myself enough.
There was another section of Integral Calculus right down the hall with Professor Federer.
I can't remember the Icelandic man's name. And, I should have made them let me transfer
to that class because my friends who, who stayed in that class continued on in Math and
majored in it, but I literally could not understand him. So, I had gotten an A in the first
semester of Calculus because I had had a different teacher, and I got a D from him, and so
it averaged out so that I passed it. Urn, so then, I looked through the schedule of, 00,
majors and came to American Civilization as a new major and I thought, "Oh, that sounds
interesting." It was the first one, and later on, my professor would say that that's why
he thought people came, because it was the first one. And, I, so I became the first, in the
first graduating class to major in American Civilization and that was a wonderful
experience. Professor Morgan was, Professor Edmund Morgan, who was, became a
Professor at Yale, was kind of my mentor and it was like a whole new world opening up.
We didn't have very many students in it so we had six or seven in a couple of seminars
and in the seminar was Professor Morgan and Professor Fleming who now is at Harvard

and, um, another professor who runs the Mass Historical Society and about four other
undergraduates. And, so it was just a whole new world, and so then, I began to do
research, historical research, 00, here. He encouraged us to do that so. I also took a
course in the History of Education. So, I did, 00, a paper over at the John Carter Brown
Library in early textbooks, horn-books and things. And, Professor Morgan submitted it
for a DAR prize, which it won, and then, the next year I did a paper on the New England
Courant using New England Courants at the MHS in Boston, and that also won a history
prize. So, he, he opened up my mind to the excitement of research. And, one of my,
loveliest things that happened to me was when my book, was published by Yale in 1984.
Uh, the year before that, I made a, you don't have to go to see your publisher, you can do
the whole thing by mail, but I knew he was at Yale. And, so, I said to my publisher, 00,
"I'd like to bring my photographs down for you to see, so we can go over them and see
which ones you want to use. And, while I'm there I'd like to have lunch with Professor
Morgan." And, so, he arranged it and I hadn't seen him since I graduated.

PK: Oh, yes, he said, "I'd always wondered what happened to you." And, it was one
of, and it was thirty years later, and I remember saying to him, "How many students did
you have that took thirty years to publish their first book?" But, it was one of those, I, I
can see now that it was something I finished. I wanted him to know that I was still a
scholar. And, I'd never let go of that, even though all of the other things that I did, and I
wanted him to know that and it was a wonderful experience. And, so, I kind of felt, I felt
rested about that. And, then, later my editor said that he was, he later became on the
editorial board to select books that Yale published and he said, "Every time he goes over
your name, he'd say, 'Oh, yes, there's my student." [laughs] It made me feel really
good.

PK: No, they were just in courses, but I, 00, they were for those courses. We had a lot
of papers.

LN: And, the other students, the other undergraduates that were in these classes, was
there, urn, do, do you have a sense of how many women, how many men there were in
the classes?
PK: I think there were, in these little classes, I think it was fairly evenly balanced. I do
remember, 00, though one of the male students being surprised that I got an A in the class.
Uh, 00, the, I do remember him saying something about it.

PK: Um, I, the main thing I remember about my class discussions in Brown was that I
became a liberal here, so I know that we must have talked a lot about, not the term "civil
rights," wasn't really used then. But, we use to talk about equal opportunity and things
like that. We talked about equality all the time and we hadn't even differentiated then the
difference between equality for everybody and equal opportunity for everybody, which
makes it a little easier to understand. And, 00, urn, so, I definitely had my mind opened
to all of that. I was ready for it, because going to Haverhill High School, I was the only
Yankee, person of Yankee background, in my senior class, college A section. That was
the time when the second generation immigrants were, 00, so successful and so, 00, my
senior high school college A section was filled with people from every ethnic group you
can think of, except Black, 00, which is, of course, a racial group. But, the, 00, and that
class has done fantastically, I mean, I can't tell you how many Ph.D.s and doctors have
come out of that group. So, I already didn't have any, uh, racism because I'd seen it
demonstrated.
LN: And, these, the, did you notice any shyness among women in your classes to speak
up? Or was that?
PK: I always spoke up, and, so it didn't happen to be something that I noticed. Uh, I
was very independent and so I probably just didn't notice it. I mean, I saw the girls
sitting in the classes knitting and I thought that was really stupid.

PK: In American Literature, I remember them knitting and I thought that was really
stupid. They didn't in every, they didn't in my American Civilization classes.

PK: I don't know, maybe that was it. That was my, the biggest class I can remember and
also that was English Literature, which a lot of kids took. I mean, it was literature which
a lot of women, I'm sorry, a lot of women took. So, I, 00, 00, my history classes were a

little more serious than that. There were more men in them. I always liked having men in
my classes.

PK: It seemed more important, more serious. Urn, and, I think maybe that, in a way, it
may be that they did take it more seriously. I'm not sure about that, but those women
were knitting, I remember that [laughs], in that one class.

PK: I lived, 00, yes, and I got really tired of it. Uh, I met my present husband, my only
husband, 00, [laughs] in the John Hay Library when I was a freshman in about October.

PK: And, what happens is, when you get, what happened then, was that you have this,
you really, you were really "rushed" that first semester when you come. The new crop
of Pembrokers were really rushed, and so I must have had thirty dates in that first
semester. And, they were all twirps because they were all my age and they just hadn't
grown up yet. And, I was despairing because I knew that I had to find a husband while I
was here because I would never have another opportunity, I was convinced of that, so I
just was really discouraged because I wanted to get it out of the way so I could get on
with my studies, which was what really interested me. So, I, 00, met this older man in
the John Hay Library because we were both pages here. And, because I had worked in
the Haverhill Public Library and he had worked at the Library of Congress, 00, we were,
00, put on a special project for President Wriston, on the reading habits, what the
undergraduates took out to read in their spare time - a really boring project. And, I
remember when I met him, thinking, "Oh, he'd make a nice father," because he was five
years, is five years older than I am and was, had been in the war and was not a twirp. I'm
sure he had been five years earlier but he wasn't then a twirp. And, he had a little bit of a
southern accent, so he was a little exotic and after a little while I decided this will do, and I
spent a couple of years trying to land him because he was gun-shy, or woman-shy. And,
was very, very cool. It was the only time in my life when I played my cards right. That
was partly why I flunked that, 00, semester of Math, was because I was really on the
verge. And, I finally landed him in my Junior year and we were engaged and then I was
able to be comfortable and my grades did terrifically well after that. I got much better
grades after all that was taken care of.

PK: And resolved and I had that off my mind. And, he was very supportive and, in fact,
he paid my thousand-dollar debt when we were ftrst married. That's all the money we
had together and we decided we were going to have to always pool our resources so let's
get rid of that.

LN: He was a sophomore and his mother was a Pembroke graduate. And, he was third
generation Brown, and my son also went to Brown, as forth generation. But, his mother
was a Pembroker. She died the year before I met her, when she was, when he was a
freshman. And, on her deathbed, she told him to fmd a nice Pembroker to get married to.
[Laughs] She was class of' 10, I think. Twelve, maybe' 12. Her name was Clarice
Ryther.

PK: I don't know. I was very anti-fraternity because I was becoming more and more of a
liberal. Oh, by the way, he was a liberal, 00, 00, I was like a convert. Vh, so, 00, the
other people - there was a group of women who went to fraternity parties and drank a

lot, and I did not do that, and also, did not approve. Uh, [laughs] so, 00, and we didn't
have any money, so we would get a hot chocolate at Charles' Restaurant - which I don't
know if it still exists, down in Providence. There was no place to do social, there was no
socializing places. That was one of the big problems. If you weren't in a fraternity, there
was practically no place to go to, to, to, 00, just date. It was a big problem, and you must
have heard about Andrews Terrace.

PK: Everyone has to know about Andrews Terrace. Well, Andrews Terrace, we had
"lates." We had to get in at 12:30 on weeknights and 1:30 on Saturday nights, and we
signed out at 10:00. Well, at 12:20 or 12:15, Andrews Terrace was all couples embraced,
I mean, wall-to-wall couples embraced from 12:00 to 12:30. And, 00, I can remember one
night [laughs] watching Dean Lewis walk through this crowd of people with some guests
and being a little embarrassed.

PK: I don't think so. I think we probably studied. I'm not, I don't remember,
specifically, that.

PK: I didn't, no, it wasn't anything. I mean, they would talk about men going to
Wheaton and we thought that was really funny. Why would they bother to do that?

PK: But, I wasn't in that class of people. That was the fraternity/socialite
a serious student and didn't have any money. So, I was a different class.

group. I was

LN: What was the, do you know the ratio, roughly, at the school? How small Pembroke
was?

PK: I think that's another reason why I thought it was good to come here because I knew
my chances of finding a man were going to be pretty good. And, I wasn't too confident.
I hadn't had a lot of men in high school. I wasn't terribly confident that I would be able
to do that.
LN: Did you notice a pattern of, of, for instance, freshmen dating a lot and then, as you
did, eventually settling down and becoming engaged? Was that part of?
PK: Well, I have since learned that 30% of women of, of Brown women have married
Brown men throughout the century. [Laughs] You know, it's not, I thought that was
really interesting. I don't, 00, I don't know exactly. I know an awful lot of women, I
graduated in ' 51, and an awful lot of women did marry quite soon.

PK: Hm mm. I should tell you a little bit about Dean Lewis. When I came to Pembroke,
Dean Morriss was the dean for two years, and she was old then. And, very much, 00, a
distant kind of person. You were a little bit in awe of her. But, she was kind of a distant
person and of an older generation so you didn't think of her as a contemporary person.
Uh, now that I know a little bit about the history of women's education, she was of that
first college group to be educated and that was the first professional women and was in
fact a distinguished woman. But, Dean Lewis was a totally different person and I really
loved Dean Lewis. She was a modern, attractive woman. Uh, very approachable and
kind of "with it" and I really liked that. And, she had been Dean of Students when I was
a freshman. So, and then, I think she went away my sophomore year to do a tour of
schools because she was going to be the next dean. I think that's what happened. Vh, so,
I got to know her. And, 00, I was the editor of the Pembroke Record in my senior year
and was on the Record earlier. I had, I knew I wanted to do some activity and I thought,
thought about what they were. I tried the Glee Club, and didn't even get in 'cause I
thought they sounded so nice. And, then, anyway, I settled it to that and it was a perfect
niche for me. Uh, so, I went to her in my senior year, as I was going to do that, and said I
wanted to make it come out twice a week and she said, "Okay, fine." My husband was

on the Brown Daily Herald. He, in fact, was the managing editor of the Brown Daily
Herald.

PK: Right, just the managing editor, there was another editor. And, then, 00, after he
graduated, then 1 was the editor and he went to work for the Providence Journal. We did
not marry until 1 graduated, three weeks after, of course. Vh, 00, so, he was still around.
So, my favorite story is that, when 1 was, 00, on April 1st of 1951, when 1 was editor of
the Pembroke Record, they were talking about building the Wriston Quadrangle. And,
there was a lot of talk in the Brown Daily Herald about it having a moat around it and the
men used to get really upset about this because they were going to be kept insulated, or 1
don't know why they were upset. So, 1 thought that was very funny, so on April 1,
1951, my husband and 1- he wasn't my husband yet, he was a grad, he was graduated brought out a fake edition of the Brown Daily Herald. He and 1 did it together and the
lead story was that when the Wriston Quadrangle opened, the men would have to be in at
2:00 because they had an extra half an hour because they had to take the women home, of
course. [LN laughs] The men would have a system of "lates" and have to be in at
2:00AM from then on. We brought it out on a Saturday night, Apri11st was on a
Sunday, so we brought it out at midnight on a Saturday night because we thought
everybody would be so drunk that they would believe it. And, in fact, we did have
several people go, "Oh my God, what are they doing to us?" 1 can still remember the
wonderful, exciting feeling about that. And, it was just one of my great coups. Uh, 1
didn't know until, oh, ten years ago that 1 probably did that because 1 was so angry at the
double standard.

PK: But, 00, at the time, 1just thought it was a great big joke, and, 00, was really proud
of pulling it off.

PK: Nothing, no, nothing, no. They didn't even have to sign out or anything like that.
And, even after 1 was married, and I'd be in the movies, ten 0' clock would come, and 1
would turn to my husband and say, "I haven't signed out." [Laughs]

PK: Well, there was a student-run government board that would, you know, try cases
and stuff. I was never interested in any of that.

PK: They were grounded, yeah, things like that happened. Oh, I think a lot happened
that I was totally unaware of. I was really interested in my studies and worked, had to
work, and worked on the Pembroke Record and had a man and so I was very focused.
And, I think there was a whole other social life that I wasn't even aware of.

PK: Ruth Ekstrom was my Features editor. She was also a country girl. She came from
Vermont and we get along very well [laughs].

PK: Well, Peggy, Peggy Conant, whom I mentioned, became a trustee. Urn, the, 00, and I
have, I have, I still have a group of friends that I see. A lot of them were waitresses. We
were a special group. Uh, 00, we did not eat, we had to serve, we had to actually serve
the other students.

PK: Pembrokers. It was a formal thing. We served them for, let's see, I guess it was,
only dinner we served them, but we had to bus during the other times. It wasn't a
cafeteria in those days. And, we were excused from Chapel. We also didn't have to wear,
00, stockings on Wednesday nights because we didn't have to go to the - Wednesday
night dinner and Sunday noon dinner you had to wear stockings and so we didn't do any
of that, have to do any of that because we were waitresses. We just wore bare legs, even
used leg make-up, you know, in those days. I didn't bother. But, 00, there was a

"gracious living" thing going on, and the waitresses definitely were a different group.
And, some of my friends that I still see at reunions who I enjoy seeing, were the other
waitresses. It was a class, it was actually a class thing. Urn, I always considered myself
solidly from a Yankee, Yankee middle-class because my family had been in Essex country
for 350 years, so I never had any problem about myself, but, economically, there
certainly was a difference. And, in my senior year, last semester, I didn't have to wait on
tables because I didn't have to earn the $300 for the next semester. And, so, I was served
for the first time.

PK: Dh, I thought it was weird, and I, 00, was kind of uncomfortable about it. But, I
was able to see - I don't think, it was a bad, it was a bad thing.
LN: Do you know how the women, generally speaking, the Pembrokers who were being
served felt? Did they take it for granted?
PK: I think I looked at them like I looked at those women who knit in class. I think there
was a whole group of, I thought, silly, silly girls.

PK: Yes, and they probably, some of them probably were, you know. I think I
definitely, 00, was, 00, not very, didn't feel very kindly toward some of them.

PK: I don't know. I was, I was very ambitious. I edited the Pembroke Record and
wanted to do that and I wanted to do well in school and I was very interested in my
education, so that, 00, I probably didn't care very much what they thought about it.

PK: You worked your way up. You started off as a reporter and, 00, you know, you
were, it was the person who could do the job.
LN: So, it was sort of a consensus among the people who worked on the paper that this
one would make the best.

LN: But, was there, um, a, a, I take it was a position of prestige? In other words, it was
an honor.

PK: Right and I wanted to make it more of a paper. I was probably a little competitive
with the Brown Daily Herald, having lived and breathed [laughs].

LN: Why could they come out daily and the Pembroke Record only come out weekly?
Was it a question of funding or staffing?
PK: Of, of, all of the above because, of course, we didn't reach as many students as they
did. Urn, and I imagine the Pembroke Record historically wasn't that old, I don't know,
but, you know, the Brown Daily Herald, I assume, has been around forever.

PK: And, it was a good newspaper.

PK: No, that's probably why I wanted to bring out the Brown Daily Herald so I would
have one paper that was read by everybody [laughs]! Professor Armstrong, who, who I
had for History 120, which was the 20th century history course, the last part of the 20th
century history course, mentioned it in class, and I remember being really pleased that a
professor had seen my April Fool's issue.

PK: Yeah, right. And, he knew the story and he mentioned that a person in his class had
brought it out, and I remember being really pleased that he had noticed.

PK: I ran the Campus Chest when I was a sophomore or junior. That was running, that
was the Community Chest, running, collecting money. Uh, I guess.

PK: Right, for ten different organizations. I remember having them add in the United
Negro College Fund [laughs] and having people say, "Oh, it's just a conscience salve,"
and thinking about that issue.
LN: Previously, I take it, there had been no organizations civil, the precursors to what we
now think of civil rights organizations, included in the?

PK: Not that I was aware of. But, I have this funny little memory, which I think. I
don't know whether it's real or not. I was in a little tiny dorm in my sophomore year,
called Bates House, which, 00, was on, 00, well, one of the little streets that runs down West Street, or whatever it was, I forget now. And, there were only about twenty of us
and there was a single room there and whether there was a Black student that year in that
single room or someone told me there had been a Black student another year, and I don't
remember which it is. That was the year when I was working so hard on getting my
future husband that I don't remember [laughs] a whole lot about that year. In my junior
year, I went to Metcalf and Peggy Conant and I were roommates that year. And, we
turned one room into a living room and one room into, 00, a sleeping room. And then, in
my senior year, I had a single in Andrews and liked that very much. But, by the time I
was a senior, I was so burned out on dormitory life, on having to sign in, and all that stuff,
I just, I spent a lot of time at my husband's apartment - whether it was legal or not, I
spent a lot of time there.

PK: No, I didn't spend, I don't think I spent the night there, but I did spend a lot of time
there. Uh, 00, that's where we would go fmally to date, 00, when we weren't going to the
Avon, which was the other attraction.

PK: We'd go to the movies, right. Uh, so, and all his roommates had been on the Brown
Daily Herald, so I really got to know them all very well and enjoy them all.
LN: So, he did not live in his own apartment? He did not live alone in his apartment. He
had roommates.

LN: Did, urn, the rules were such that Pembrokers lived on campus, I take it, for the four
years that they were enrolled?

PK: Well, you see there were Veterans here so they had to fmd housing for them, so they
had to live off-campus.

PK: Hm rom, but that's all right, they wouldn't have wanted to live on campus [laughs].
You don't want to live in a dormitory after the service.

PK: I do know that there was a big fight about apartments later when I was the editor of
the Pembroke Alumna about whether the students could live off campus. So, apparently
they did, but it didn't occur to me.

PK: Right. So, apparently, 00. I don't think I would have thought that you could put it
together financially.

PK: There was a co-op housing, co-op housing, which I did not decide to do because it
was too distracting. I wanted to put my energies in what I did, and I was always

working. I always had that "having to get there for lunch" and "having to get there for
dinner" - that was always in the rhythm of things.

PK: Hm mm. Vh, there were city girls too, though, and the city girls didn't eat in the
dormitories. The city girls, uh, used West House - you know where that is? On the
comer of Brown Street and Meeting Street, and that was their kind of place where they
hung out. And, I had several friends who were city girls. I enjoyed some of them very
much.

LN: Oh, they brought their lunch. So, there were, there were no dining facilities for
them?
PK: No, they either brought their lunch or they ate on Thayer Street. So, uh, they were
definitely, it was a definite different group. But, they were smart, and, uh, you know,
they were good students and they were in extra-curricular activities. That's how I met
them, in the extra-curricular activities because I also was on Question Club. When you
were the head of an organization, you also were part of Question Club, which was the
student leaders.

PK: I think their, their point, they, they ran Freshman Week. I think that's what we did.
I think that's what it existed for. I think Questions mean, meant, students asking
undergraduates, freshmen asking questions.

PK: That week, 00, I think we had a lot to do with Freshman Week. I don't remember
what we had to do with it, but quite a lot.
LN: And, after that, the meeting after the orientation for the Freshman Week, there
wasn't that much to do?

LN: What about Chapel? You said you were excused because you were a waitress. How
did Chapel work for everybody else? Do you?
PK: It was required. I do remember the times I did go to Chapel being a little
embarrassed about singing Protestant hymns, 00, 00, around Jewish students.

PK: Right. I mean, I knew all the Protestant hymns. I was raised in a Congregational
Church, so I was right at home, but I thought it was a little strange.

PK: Just before dinner. So, that means we served lunch and dinner, that's right. We
served lunch and dinner. It was breakfast we bused. So, we also had to bus breakfast.
Now, I think we alternated on that and then, weekends, I think we had to work too. Well,
it was just always there, and I remember the uniforms always smelled. Vh, you had your
uniform hanging in your room. Oh, you wore a little yellow uniform, with a little, cute,
little skirt. And, your uniform was always hanging in your room, and you had it hanging
on your door, on your closet door - I remember in Andrews, especially -because you
were always rushing in and out of it. So, it wasn't very nice smelling. And, it smelled a

little bit of the dish room and everything. Now, I can still remember that. When I open
my own dishwasher to this day, if it's in mid-cycle, I say, "Oh, yeah, the Brown dish
room. " [Laughs] Smells just like that.

PK: I don't think so. I have some little memory that theirs was maybe once a week on
Wednesdays. They couldn't fit the whole Brown student body in Sayles Hall. But, there
were cuts and things. You only had a certain number of cuts for Chapel.

PK: Oh, and I should mention Phys Ed, which we called "gym." We had four years of
required gym, everybody will tell you that. And, 00, Bessie Rudd was the great gym
teacher and she was a very formidable woman. But, we had two years required, two
semesters required of Modem Dance. And, my daughter happens to be a professional.

PK: I was on the class team, and I really did enjoy that. So, I had a lot of friends from
that too, from basketball. And, there were city girls in that group, too.

PK: No, they were extra. The class teams were extra. I never got any further than class
team. I did in Lacrosse, because they started a Lacrosse group and Radcliffe had started a
Lacrosse group, so we did have this one game between Radcliffe and Brown, but none of
us knew even, really, how to cradle a ball, more or less make any points [laughs], so it
was a pretty sad game!

PK: They had some, they did have some teams. I don't really remember too much about
it, but there were definitely some teams and I would have been a little more of a jock,
because I loved basketball, I think, if I hadn't gotten so busy in these other ways. And,
then everybody began to get to the point where you took the sport that took the least
effort, so we all took archery, for instance, near the end.

PK: To fulfill the gym requirement. And, you just couldn't, urn, you
just didn't have the energy or the time to continue doing it, 00, so you'd fmd these things
that you could do. So, as I'm thinking about it [laughs], you were changing into your gym
uniform. You were changing into your waitress uniform [laughs].

PK: And, all of these things were pretty smelly, so it was this kind of feeling of
uncomfort.

PK: No, we wore, we wore bobby socks and saddle shoes and it was absolutely that. I
did have a bad thing happen when I arrived as a freshman. The "new look" came in so my
few new clothes were immediately out of style because they were too short. And, that
was a real tragedy.

PK: Well, for everybody. It happened during that freshman year. So, it was a real
problem because, you know, we didn't have a lot of money, and, so, my clothes were too
short and a lot of other people's were too.

PK: I'm not too sure. I don't think so. I think we probably all managed to do something
about it because we would, you would never, never not do the right skirt length in that
era. Skirt length was something that was absolutely, everybody had to do what the style
was.

PK: I think that's what people wore pretty much. And, we had little dickies, little white
collars, sometimes, our pearls.

LN: Was there, urn, were there ways of distinguishing classes among female students by
how they dressed or what they wore?
PK: Oh, yes. I'm sure there was the cashmere sweater crowd. I'm sure of that. Uh, but
I, my mother knit my sweaters. So, that's, 00.
LN: They wore cashmere sweaters, they wore pearls. They, this, I take it, they just had
more money and it showed in their clothes.
PK: Yeah, I think so, I think it was that, the cashmere sweaters, but I wasn't aware of
that. I mean, there wasn't a lot of class. I shouldn't, I made this distinction because of
the waitresses, but you didn't have the feeling of some people being really rich or
anything like that. But, there was the whole other life which was the fraternity life,
which I know nothing about, going on.
LN: Which, which, I take it, were there sororities that were
comparable?

PK: That's right, and they hung out with fraternity people, and it was another group of
people.

PK: Although, I knew I wanted to be a high school teacher, I didn't want to waste my
courses on education courses, so it was a real dilemma for me. So, I did take the History
of Education and, then, after that, decided I wasn't going to waste any more courses and
that I would get my degrees, a degree later to take care of that. Uh, meanwhile, when I
was a senior, I went down to the Providence School Department to see what the
requirements were and - because my husband-to-be was an ed, was a reporter in the
Providence Journal, so I thought we probably would live around here. And, so, 00, they

told me that because I was going to be married they wouldn't even interview me. This
was in 1951.

PK: Right, right, that's right. And, that was not changed in New England until 1953. So,
I thought, "Well, I can't be a teacher anyway - this was 1951 - what am I going to do?"
So, when I graduated, I took a job, uh, in the Pembroke Placement office, helping to do actually what I did was I did the undergraduate jobs, and the person in charge of
placement did the graduate jobs. And, that was when I was first married. And, so, I did
that for a year. And, uh, then, I said to my husband, uh, "I still want to teach." And, he
knew that I wanted to teach, so in 1952, we went west to Seattle, where I went to
graduate school for a year at the University of Washington. His father had remarried and
was living in Seattle. He had married a woman who was a professor at the University of
Washington. His father had been a college professor. And, so, uh, uh, I got my Masters
at the University of Washington, did my teacher preparation. I got my Masters in
History, but I did my teacher preparation also at the same time, and did become a high
school teacher. They didn't care whether I was married or not. Uh, so I did finally do
that. And, it was the right way. I didn't waste my undergraduate credits on, on that.

PK: On the education courses, which I took later as a Master's program, which I still
think is the better way because I think your undergraduate time is the only time when
you can really get music. I took a lot of music courses, music appreciation courses. It
was a new field to me and got a great deal out of them. I took art history courses. I really
had my mind opened up. I too a lot of cultural courses, which have stood in good stead
my whole life. It was a real, Br, my experience at Brown was a real opening to me. I
didn't really have any courses that I wasted. Even the math courses, I do quantitative
history now, and even though I don't really know calculus anymore, I can think it. I can
think through and even that was helpful to me. So, I really don't, uh, didn't waste any
time. And, Dean Lewis, uh, to go back to her, was always a great help to me. Whenever I
would go to her with a problem, like how was I going to continue because my father's
business had failed, and could we bring out the Pembroke Record twice a week and I had a
couple of problems, little, few, little problems with staff. I had one woman on the staff
who was very difficult to handle. And, I don't know. There were a few times. Every
time I would go to her, I would always be so amazed that she would have the solution.
Now, I remember coming away from my meetings with her and saying, "Oh, there is a
way out." So, I was very, very, uh, she was a real mentor to me and when I graduated, in
my Senior year at the Alumnae dinner, whatever it was, the Senior dinner, she spoke and
she talked about several members of the class, about what was going to happen to them.
And, she said, "And, ifthe Pembroke Alumnae Office ever wants to have a good
magazine, a full-fledged magazine, then they can hire Polly Welts to do that." So, she put

that in my head as an idea so that when, four years after, we were on the West Coast for
four years and we came back east. Uh, I'd been teaching high school there and we came
back east, 00, and decided it was time to start a family and to quote, "settle down," if one
ever does, and, 00, I wrote to her and said, "I am back now. I can't work full-time for a
while but I'd really love a part-time job. Do you really mean it that you'd like me to do
this?" And, this was five years later. And, she wrote me back and said, "Yes," she did
mean it and had me come down and meet Doris Stapleton, who was then the new
Alumnae secretary and we immediately worked something out, so I was able to edit the
Pembroke Alumna for the eleven years that my kids were pre-schoolers. My son, when
my son entered the first grade, then I took a full-time, went on to a full-time career, but
for those eleven years, while I was having my babies, while I was nursing my babies, even
here, would bring them down, 00, I edited the Pembroke Alumna. So, it was a really nice
thing for me to do.

PK: We went to my mother's house in Haverhill. Vh, she was then widowed. My
father died while I was on the West Coast. And, 00, we spent four years on the West
Coast, came back with no money. We just had a wonderful time. It was the most, 00, I'd
always been poor and never had enough money and so we spent four years - two in the
Pacific Northwest and two in the San Francisco Bay area, lived in Berkley - and we just
went everywhere and did everything and just had a wonderful time. And, then, we drove
back home with three hundred dollars left, which is all that we had saved, two of us
working full-time for three years!

PK: He was working, doing public relations for the National Safety Council. And, -- he's
always been a writer and done things that he could do writing. So, then, when we came
back, then, I knew that I was going to have to, that I wanted to, I was afraid of losing my
mind. I wanted to have a family very much, but I was afraid of, of not, of, you know,
losing all of my stuff I wanted to do. So, I knew I needed to do something and that was
just a perfect job for me. And, she was very supportive, Miss Lewis and Doris
Stapleton, both very supportive of me and helped me always through that. Of course, I
was paid $1000 a year for the first time, to put out four issues. The editor of the Brown
Alumni Monthly was a full-time, well-paid job at that time, and they put out eight issues.

PK: He had a full-time position. He probably got 25 at that time, and I didn't even care
at that point. I mean, I didn't notice it, you know. I think I worked my way up to $2000,
I'm not sure. But, I'd been teaching for $2000 and that was what you got teaching too.

PK: right, or maybe it was two or three thousand, but I mean, things were, you know, it
was a different economic scale. But, it was certainly, in comparison to the Brown Alumni
Monthly. And, I came to realize all of that later, as 1.

PK: I just wanted, I wanted, it wasn't so much that I wanted to earn the money, it was
that I wanted to have a job. And, it was a wonderful job. I would come down once a
month, 00, to do my interviews and do the rest of it by mail. And, had a lot of support
from Doris Stapleton. And, I think they were good. Dh, I went through them last night,
very quickly, to see what in fact I did do. And, what I know is that, I had to write "Class
Notes" for the first, I did it for eleven years and I had to write Class Notes myself for
about eight years, and that was very difficult. I eventually did burn out on it, and they
finally hired someone to do Class Notes. But, that was, I, I'm sure I was always a
feminist, but that was what turned me into being a real feminist because I kept saying,
"Why are these, what are these women doing? They've graduated from college and they
aren't doing anything with their lives." They were writing about their children, they were
doing a certain amount of community work, but there weren't any professionals and it
really bothered me. Dh, I think now that maybe the professionals didn't send in their
Class Notes, but I don't think that was entirely the case. So, I looked through the
Pembroke Alumna. I started in July 1957 and my daughter was born in April '58. And,
00, I was, and my son was born three years later. So, there were many times when I had
a little baby and I was trying to do this. In fact, my daughter's first sentence was
"Mummy's busy" [laughs]. Her first word was "flower," at least that. Anyway, in July
'59, I published an article called "On dusting off degrees." And, this was, 00, I did this
many times. It was five alumnae, who would each talk about how they had gone back to
work. And, then, 00, I, the next year I had an article called "What do you do with an
educated mind?" And, I had five alumnae write and one was a full-time worker, one was
community affairs, doing community affairs, and one was just happy with her children
and she was a Phi Beta Kappa. And, I had at the top, "What do you think?" So, I was
obviously trying to understand this issue myself. Dh, then, I had an article by Margaret
Mead, who had come to speak on campus in July '60, "Is college compatible with
marriage?" And, that was the new thing that had happened about undergraduates wanting
to marry while they were still in college. Then, I had alumnae in medicine, alumnae in
religion. I had an article called "Full-time Mothers, Part-time Jobs," of which I was one.
Then, Miss Lewis died. It was a great blow to me. She died when she was in her early
fifties of cancer. And, she was gracious to the end. She entertained you in bed.

PK: And, I remember bringing my baby daughter to see her, my baby daughter to see her.
And, 00, she was in charge right to the end; it really was something. Uh, Barnaby
Keeney, the President, and John McIntyre, who is still the Corporation secretary, would
go over and have a little drink with her at night, before supper.

PK: People did. And, it was a really, a really, uh, uh, she was just gracious to the end.
So, she left her money for a woman professor.

PK: She didn't endow a chair because it was so small. And, she left her money for a
woman professor. So, I immediately brought out an issue on women professors, and I
can still remember the two-page spread with a large picture of one of the women
professors, so that we'd have enough women professors for a full-page spread. And, a
little article by Barnaby Keeney talking about how, yes, women could make good
professors [laughs]. And, we did it, had an article by a sociologist, teacher here, about the
way there were fewer women Ph.D.s then there had been and things were looking worse.
And, this was all, you know, much, pretty much of a surprise. But, it was a big push for
that because that's what she wanted and so I wanted it. Uh, I don't know if! had been
aware of the issue so much because when I got my Masters at the University of
Washington, I wrote a major thesis, 00, on, on a man in colonial Williamsburg who was
trying to decide whether to go, stay with the English or go with the colonists, with the
rebels, or whatever. And, had that professor say to me, "Are you going on for your
Ph.D.?" And, I said, "Oh, no. I'm going to be a high school teacher." That had always
been my goal and it never occurred to me, but he wanted me to do it and I just, "What are
you talking about? I have another goal in mind." Uh, I could not picture myself. I had
one woman professor at Brown and she was Mildred Pansey, who taught Early Music
and she was brought in. She was a, she was the wife of Malcolm Freiburg, actually, the
one, the man who became the head of the mass Historical Society who was on that
American Civilization panel, who's name I couldn't remember earlier. And, 00, she
taught this lovely course in Early Music and I took a lot of music courses. And, she was
the only woman professor I had, but she was part-time and I knew that, so I couldn't
image myself. So, when Miss Lewis left her money for a woman professor, it was kind
of a new idea to me. Oh, and I had never had a woman professor at the University of
Washington, either.

PK: But, she wasn't even a full-timer. So, it didn't, she was special and it was a special
course. It was different. So, uh, it was, I can almost say this, October 1962 was when I
brought that out, and that's not very long ago. I can almost say this, that it was the first
time I thought, "Oh, there ought to be women professors." I actually thought about
marrying a man who was going to be a professor. When I first me my husband I knew his
father had been a professor, and I thought, "Well, he'll make a nice professor." I didn't
continue with that because he, obviously, wasn't. He was a gentleman scholar, all the
way through because he was interested in the Brown Daily Herald. That's what he did,
so, uh, uh, it didn't linger with me, but I did not image myself as doing that. Although, I
really did have the opportunity and also my, Edmund Morgan certainly would have.

PK: Encouraged me, but he knew I wanted to be a high school teacher, so, you know,
"That's what she wants to do." Vh, so then, I became a little more feminist, I guess.
And, so did society. Vh, and Doris Stapleton did and The Feminine Mystique came out
and I can still remember to this day, Doris Stapleton saying to me, uh, "There's this
book, The Feminine Mystique, you ought to read it. I think we should have a panel on
continuing education and see what we can do to get women to go back to school and go
back to careers." And, so we did. We had a panel on, uh, this, all the centers for
continuing education that there were around the country, all four of them [laughs], and,
uh, uh, really got excited about having Pembroke begin to deal with this issue because,
until that time, all Pembroke was was a place for women to live. There was, of course, an
admissions staff, so they also accepted women. And, it, as I, as I have come to
understand it, it was a social system, not an academic system. And, it did do nothing at
all to advance the, uh, uh, career goals of women except in that little placement office that
they had.

PK: No, for babysitting jobs, people did, but, uh, I think some people got jobs that way,
but, uh, uh, I would always be too independent anyway to get ajob that way. I would
never have anybody honcho it for me [laughs]. So, uh, so we had this "Posey" Dean
Pierrel, Rosemary Pierre 1was now the Dean and we had this thing. So, we got really
excited and, uh, conventing, had a meeting, formed a committee, had a meeting, and
convinced Rosemary Pierrel to submit a proposal, uh, for some kind of a center at
Pembroke that would include continuing education, that would include scholars on
campus. I did know a lot about the Radcliffe models, and I've always been very closely

connected with, with, with stuff at Radcliffe. To this day, I'm very active at Schlesinger
Library and, and, 00, go to the Bunting talks. It's been my real scholarly base actually.
And, uh, so I did, I mean, that's now, but I did know about those, those models, and so I
just thought, "Well, it was time for, for Brown to do something about that." In 1964, I
had articles on Civil Rights and students were beginning to do tutoring in the Black
community and I began to get really interested in that. Then, we began to demand more
alumnae trustees, and I had articles on that in 1965, so I was beginning to really think
about these things. Well, what happened was I wrote Rosemary Pierrel about this, 00, in,
first in 1962 - and I'm going through a few papers here because I don't remember the
dates. Vh, I, I suggest, my first proposal was October 1962, so that was even before we
had that session, and I said that I thought, "It was time for Pembroke to do something
specific towards helping women of Rhode Island and environs, whether alumnae or not,
to realize more fully their potential as educated women. There is no reason why financial
considerations should stop such a plan because foundation support should be available.
It should be a three-part job: research on what's needed and what's already been set-up;
establishing a program; and, then, promoting it so that people will pay attention to it."
And, I said, "This is a real problem, it's easy for women to make their housework and
neighborhood coffee hours take all day. I do not mean to discount worthwhile
community activities or reading to one's children." So, 00, nothing happened. Vh, I then
wrote her another proposal a couple of years later and she wrote me back, "There's too
much meat in your last two memos for me to try to answer them in note, so if your
schedule permits, next time you're down, why don't we chat." And, nothing happened.
So, finally, in 1966, I really got angry because nothing had happened, and I could see that
Pembroke wasn't moving with the times. Radcliffe was moving with the times, and I just
really was embarrassed for this place and thought, you know, "This is really terrible."
So, I wrote this very long letter to President Ray Heffner, who was the President, and I
have a copy here. It was October 21, 1966, and then made a date to come down and talk
with him. I can remember I had on a new suit. I remember being, getting myself so that I
would look very professional. And, I said, first that "there should be a Pembroke
program for educated women. One of the most important reasons for coordinate
education is that the rhythm of a woman's life is different from that of a man's. I feel it's
high time that Pembroke did something to help women of Rhode Island realize more fully
their potential as educated women." My second plan was "equal opportunity for women
begins at home. I am on pretty shaky ground here because I have no facts and may be all
wrong. I would like someone to make a comparison of the status and salaries of the
women administrators at Pembroke and their counterparts at the College." That's what
the men's college was called. "For example, the position of Dean of Admission at
Pembroke is of comparable importance to the position of Dean of Admission to the
College and her job is in a way tougher." She had to deny more students for admission
then the men did. Vh, they took fewer students. "Does she have equivalent status,
including salary?" I knew that it must be different. Well, it was! Then, I said, 00, "there
should be a Pembroke library with a center for continuing education, enclosing the West
side of the Pembroke campus." I wanted them to build a Radcliffe Institute. That's what

I was really saying. And, I wanted them to have a Schlesinger Library. Well, we fmally
got the archives started last year. It's taken that long. And, 00, but I wanted them to
have a center for continuing education. And, then, my last one, because I was becoming
very involved in the Civil Rights movement, which I then did as a digression for twenty
years, keeping the student body at diverse. "Keeping the student body at Pembroke
diver. One of Pembroke's greatest strengths has been the diversity of its student body.
It has always had a higher proportion of students from public than from private schools.
I am greatly afraid that Pembroke may become a place for intellectual and well-off elite. I
also feel we have a responsibility to give this fine Brown education to more people. Some
possible solutions: increase the Pembroke enrollment to 1200. Accept more students
with rough edges, less genteel." And, then, of course, the whole issue of the Black
students. And, at that time, I said to Mr. Heffner that Rosemary Pierrel had submitted a
proposal to the Carnegie Foundation, I think, for some kind of center for continuing
education. And, he went to his files and said no proposal was ever written or submitted.
And, we had been under the impression that a proposal had been submitted and turned
down. So, I got really kind of angry at that point, and I felt really let down. So, by the
middle of 1968, 00, I decided to leave my position. I was involved with starting libraries
in the Boston schools at that time, which was as a Civil Rights activist, and did in fact
make it my profession and did it for twenty years. Urn, but, my last editorial, which I
published in January 1968 was called "La Difference." And, uh, I said that "Pembroke
should have mature women based on the Pembroke campus, dealing with today's
problems, whether by working in mental health, urban education, problems of peace,
seekers of DNA, and all those things, would be a tangible example to the undergraduates
that their education can be relevant to the real world and that they do not have to face an
all-or-nothing future because of 'la difference." And, 00, talked about how we don't have
the solutions yet for how women can fulfill themselves both by having families and by
working, but that nobody's doing anything to work on it. And, so I said, 00, that there is
no reason for Pembroke to exist if they don't start to tackle this problem. I later wrote a
letter to the Brown Alumni Monthly saying the same thing. Uh, this was in January
1970. I got more angry: "Unless Pembroke's administration, alumnae, students, actively
fight for the liberation of women, there's no justification for its existence as a coordinate
college." So, then, in Jan, December 1970, when the merger was announced and we were
told to write letters, I wrote a letter to then Dr. Donald Hornig, who was the President,
and told him that I supported the merger, 00, if they would set up an institution to deal
with what I was now using as a catch phrase, "the substantive needs of women." And, he
wrote me back and said, yes, they were going to do that. And, then, nothing happened
for five years, and so I stopped giving my money to the University. That was my civil
disobedience, my $25 a year [laughs], and, and wrote a little angry note each time I would,
and I never came, and I didn't come back.

PK: I'd send a note and saying, "Until they set up a center for women on the campus,
which was promised in the merger form, you will never get another cent from me." Well,
I never got an answer either. They just filed it away. And then, a friend of mine - 00.,
00, it wasn't Weezie Reese. It was Edie Weideman Smith - finally, got the job of, 00, all
alum, an Alumnae relations job and she cut, and she intercepted one of those letters. And,
this was five years - I'd been editor for Pembroke Alumna for eleven years and no one
was paying attention to me and I was really mad. And, so, 00, I mean, I was busy in my
other career and also by then I was going to graduate school and I eventually got my
doctorate, so, 00, Edie invited me down. And, she invited me down with some of the
deans who are still here and we had lunch, and, so, we talked about these things. And,
they were forming a Pembroke Study Committee; there was a part-time director of the
Sarah Doyle Center, 00, the, and she sent me an article about how they, 00, had their
budge cut from like what, from $16,000 to $6000 or something. And, 00, I began to get a
little involved. A friend of mine became the first woman director of the Alumnae
Association, a voluntary job became the first woman director of the Alumna Association.
I mean, a voluntary job, and she put me on the Board for four years, and I tried to get a,
00, 00, a mentoring thing set up.

PK: Phyl Tillinghast and she was in my class. And, I tried to get a mentoring system set
up so that women who were working and undergraduates could get together and things
like that.

PK: Uh, they always had it merged - as I understand it, it's just been a merged thing, so
it's still a men and women thing, and I wanted to have it be a feminist-specific thing. Uh,
and then, I would, then I went on my letter writing campaign to all these poor women
who had had me to lunch - Kay Hall, who was assistant, I think she's some kind of a
dean now. And, 00, one of the, 00, and I, I wrote to each President as they came. And,
then, I got angry because the Nancy Duke Lewis thing hadn't been funded. And, they
had a woman named Jacqueline Mattfield was the provost for a little while.

PK: And, I wrote her and never got an answer. And, I was really, I really had some very
angry years. Uh, fmally, they decided - oh, and I got my class reunion, that was a big
thing. My 25th class reunion, I got them to, to vote, to make a demand that the Nancy
Duke Lewis, 00, 00, chair be funded because it was ten years now since she died. And,
that, 00, a Pembroke Center would be established for women, the Sarah Doyle Center
would be funded better. So, we, we actually passed, I got them to pass this proposal and
it did reach Charles Tillinghast, who was then the, uh, Chancellor. And, he was Phyllis

Tillinghast's husband's uncle or cousin or something. So, it got back to her, "Well, what
do they want," meaning what do the women want. And, I now know, in my research of
women's history, that when you finally get the men to say, "What do the women want
anyway?" you've penetrated their minds. It's not that they were opposed to you. They
had never heard you. So, 00, so slowly, we, 00, women's center, the women's center
began, the Sarah Doyle Center began to get funded and the, 00, Nancy Duke Lewis chair
got funded. And, so when Dr. Swearer, when Howard Swearer became President, of
course, I wrote him my letter with my, my, my usual comments, as I did to each
President. Dh. I probably won't have to for this one that's coming now, the first one
ever. And, so he wrote me back and said - this was April 14, 1977 - "We are seeking a
full-time director for the Sarah Doyle Women's Center and we've taken steps to fill the
Nancy Duke Lewis chair." And, I really was ecstatic. I wrote him back this little tiny
letter, after all these long, long letters that I was always writing.

PK: "Your letter with the news of your work for women at Brown was extremely
heartening to me. Let me extend my sincerest wishes for success in the directions you've
outlined. My husband and I look forward to meeting you at the Boston reception on
May 10." And, that was all I had to say to him. And, since that time, things began to
progress. Then, Joan Scott came and set up the Pembroke Center, and I was absolutely
ecstatic whe"n I first met her and heard of her plans and saw what she had done. I just
couldn't believe it, that something had finally happened. Dh, so, I really did kind of rest
my case until the Pembroke Archives problem came up and, uh, we, 00, when Christine
Dunlap Farnham - well, she had appointed me. My job in Boston was to set up libraries
in the Boston schools. Now, I wasn't a librarian. I was a community organizer so I had
to go back to school to get my library credentials. And, that's why I started back to
graduate school because I so much wanted to do that. And, 00, once I got my credentials
and began to do the job - and I did become Director of Library and Media Services and
did in fact start all the libraries in the Boston schools, 120 of them and had, 00, had very
strong ties with the Black community to this day. And, it really was a wonderful career
for me, 00, the, 00, during that time. So, Christine Dunlap Farnham, who was the woman
who went to Joan Scott and said, "You should have an alumnae board connected with
your Pembroke Center," 00, knew that I had this connection with the libraries, so she
asked me - and by then I was a published women's historian also - and so she asked me
to be the Chair of an archives committee. And, I said that I would be glad to chair this. I
always knew that I wasn't going to do any work, that I was going to make them hire a
professional to do that, because what I had done in Boston was, we started libraries with
volunteers, but as soon as I could get the funding, 00, we started to pay people. They
were community aides and we didn't progress past that except in the middle and high
schools. But, in the elementary schools they're still community people, who we trained
but I still think it's a good plan. Uh, so I wanted them to hire a professional, so I knew
that my whole goal was, was going to be to change their thinking. And, Joan Scott handed

me two boxes in which was Bessie Rudd's mortarboard. And, that night I dreamt about
Bessie Rudd [laughs]. Uh, and, I said, "Well, no, this isn't what I'm going to do. We've
got to find a way to get this funded." And, we began to talk about funding. Well, sadly
enough, the funding came because Christine Dunlap Farnham was killed and she left her
money for the, uh.

PK: For the archives. And, well, it was decided that was the best way to spend it, and,
00, so I went, uh, on quite a campaign to make sure that they hired a professional with all
that money because they wanted to use a graduate student for it, and I knew that that was
not what was needed, they needed a professional to do that. I knew the Archives would
prove themselves immediately and that they would find a way to continue it, and I think,
in fact, that's probably happened. So, that other piece of my early dream, which was the
beginning ofa women's library, a library for women's studies, has begun. I think that, in
fact, it will be an archives, this archives will, 00, include, 00, community organizations.
It will be a Rhode Island women's archives, not just a Brown women's archives. So, I
think, in fact, it will begin to develop a significant manuscript collection and will be very
useful, uh, for the study of women's history. And, 00, I don't see it as ever growing
anywhere near the size of the Schlesinger Library, which is just about to open their new
building, which is four stories high. However, 00, it will begin to meet the needs that are
not met, and, uh, if we can hold on to a full-time position, I think that will be really
significant. Uh, most universities have a women's studies librarian, full-time librarian,
and, 00, whether we'll ever get to that point or not, I don't know. But, in any case, I
think that's good. I'm very pleased with the development of the Pembroke Center. I
think that it needs to, 00, think about getting itself a little less elitist and perhaps, think of
some ways of helping to let the high school teachers of Rhode Island get trained in
teaching women's history, and I think maybe that will come. Uh, so, I do feel that some
of these things I worked for for a long time are going to, 00, finally happen. I will be
writing a 1991 history of women at Brown. I'm not writing it, I'm editing it and have, 00,
and am looking forward to that because I do think we can, 00, 00, we can point to quite a
lot of progress in a lot of areas. Uh, it's progress, it is not, 00, we aren't completed yet.
There is not 50% women trustees and there's not 50% women faculty, and there is 50%
women undergraduates, but that has been for a long time and obviously is not enough. So,
we have a long way to go, but I think that the question is on the table. Some solutions are
being provided and some voices are being heard so I think that it's, that it's coming along.
Uh, the, 00, I have become a woman's historian. I got my doctorate about ten years ago.
Did it always at night, 00, always did all of that at night. I did take one year to do my
dissertation research, which I did in the Schlesinger Library. My dissertation, 00, is, 00,
was a study of women on the Boston school committee from the 1870s to 1905. And, I,
I started it because I wondered why those schools were named for women who I'd never
heard of. There were people like Abby May had a school named for her and I wanted to
know who they were. And, so, I found Notable American Women, which is this

wonderful, now four-volume, uh, DAB for women. I did, in fact, contribute an article to
the fourth volume and, uh, began to look them up and got really excited about it and found
that there was a Boston school connection, which, and I, I was working in the Boston
schools, so I began to research the, the whole story of women on the Boston school
committee from that time until this time. And, it was, uh, very interesting to me because
I was bringing reform to the school system at the same time and reading about how those
women brought reform to the school system, so I had some models, some nineteenthcentury models, and it was amazing how many similarities there were. After I published
my dissertation, uh, I was going to bring it out, but I fell on to some letters at the
Connecticut Historical Society through a footnote about some women who had gone west
to teach before the Civil War. Well, I had gone west to teach for opportunity also. And,
I've always been interested in the west - uh, we're great, uh, hikers. I just finished, I just
received my badge for climbing all the 4000-footers in New Hampshire. Just two months
ago, I received my badge. It cost me two dollars to get the badge, but I decided I'd have it,
I'd have it up in front of me. It took us quite a long time to do that, but we always have
loved the west and hiking in the wilderness and things like that. So, uh, it was a perfect
book for me and I, uh, read these letters about these women who had gone west to teach
before the Civil War and a diary and, uh, found, and knew that they were not reluctant
pioneers, so I wrote to Yale, who had published Johnny Faragher's book about women
being reluctant pioneers and said, "If you've published that book then you have to
publish my book and I'm giving a Berkshire paper" - that's the Berkshire Conference on
women's history, paper, I think it was the year it was at Vassar - uh, "would you like to
see it?" And, the editor, Chuck Grench, said, "Yes, I would like to see it," and then he
kept saying, "Send me more, send me more." And, I knew that it was going to be
published, right from that first letter, I had the sense of it, so it was worth it for me to do
that. So, I put all my evening time.

PK: I wrote this book at night, right. I had a very stressful job. Vh, it was a very
interesting, stressful job, but when I came home at night, I would go to my desk and do
this instead, and weekends too. Vh, it really was relaxation for me. I loved doing it. I
loved doing it.

PK: It was really a delight to see those problems in the 1840s that I no longer had to
solve. So, uh, [laughs], so I, uh, so the book came out and it's been such a pleasure. I've
been asked to do so many things, like exhibits, all kinds of stuff. I'm doing an exhibit now
on the exchange of New England culture with Ohio, uh, an NEH grant that someone has.
And, uh, I'm teaching a couple courses at V. Mass in women's history and social reform.
And, it really was a real opening to me. And, and, uh, so I began, I've done several
articles, lots of reviews and right now I'm doing a book on the response of women to

national parks, which is, 00, written, about a third of it. Uh, and the Park Service funded
my travel for nine months to interview all over the country and Alaska, to interview, uh,
members of the Park Service, but I'm also doing a history of women in the nineteenth
century who traveled or were scientists or were archeologists in parks. And, it's really
been a lot of fun to do that. So, I retired in June from the Boston schools, after twenty
years, leaving a Black woman in charge. I, I stayed on a year longer than I wanted to
because I didn't feel the time was right, but I thought, felt the time was right and she
would take over. And, 00, have spent this year writing my book, teaching at U. Mass
and, 00, 00, getting ready to edit the 1991 history of Brown. I'm not sure what I will do
next year. I probably will still continue to teach some, but I'm not sure. Anything can
happen. Uh, we were just talking about whether I would give these angry letters that I
wrote to every president and everybody who would listen during that period when I felt,
00, that Pembroke, or that, that Brown was not moving fast enough. I think the reason I
was so angry was because it was here at Brown that I became a liberal and learned about,
00, equal opportunity, and it really opened my eyes to all of this. I was ready because of
where I had been brought up. But, it opened my eyes to all of this. And, then, when I
found that the university was worse than the broader society and not helping women, and
not helping Black people - and later my son, 00, is, graduated from Brown in 1983 and
was a gay rights activist and so I also found out about that - urn, I really felt let down. I
felt deceived, 00, that this place that had made me into a liberal wasn't liberal. Well, I
have now found out from lots of people that happens to everybody. It's called "losing
your innocence," [laughs] but I think that was why I got so, 00, so upset and, 00, 00, was
so angry for those five years. I'm very calm now, except when I find out that they're
thinking of not considering, continuing the archives, then I find that I can get angry all
over again. I really would like to leave this place in peace. It's really been on my mind
ever since I was an undergraduate in 1947 and I, I just think I've had enough and I would
really like the feeling - I hope the 1991 book will do it - that I have finally laid the ghost
to rest.

PK: I suppose. But, it really was, I think, because the University, 00, stood for
something and then didn't do it. I'm sure that was what, what did me. You wanted me to
say a little bit about my family, how I worked it out. Uh, well, it was very, it worked out
really nicely because, 00, while my children were in pre-school, I did the Pembroke
Alumna. And, then, as soon as my son entered the first-grade I began to work full-time in
the Boston schools. And, 00, my husband wanted - we've always alternated careers. He
wanted to start a business and so, because I was doing well with my career, 00, then he
was able to start his own advertising/public relations business and not make a lot of
money for a few years. Then, we both had to work hard when the kids were in college.
Uh, our son did graduate from Brown and our daughter is a dancer and is now in graduate
school at Arizona State University in dance, Masters of Fine Arts in dance. Uh,. but
she's on her own, and he's on his own in Manhattan. So, 00, 00, then, when I decided

that I wanted to retire - I got a good retirement because I was making a good salary by
then - urn, I, uh, uh, because I wanted to become a full-time historian, then I was able to
do that. However, his retirement is very soon too, so we're going to probably have to
make another adjustment. Uh, I think we'll be making financial adjustments always. I
don't think we'll ever be secure, we'll always be gambling a little bit and reaching for more
than we can afford, uh, so that we can do the things we want to do. And, I notice that my
children are doing the same thing [laughs]. So, financial security, I guess, is not a goal.
LN: Was there ever any tension between you and your husband about, uh, where to live?
Or?
PK: Well, we've had security in that. Uh, we built a house for $12,000 in Lexington,
Massachusetts, which is now worth many times that and we've stayed there. We built it
a lot ourselves, we did a lot of it ourselves. My husband is very handy and so we did a
lot of it ourselves. His name is Roger Williams Kaufman, and my son's name is Roger
Williams Kaufman, Jr., and they are descendants of Roger Williams. And, uh, my
daughter's name in Katharine Sewall Kaufman.
LN: Thank you very much for sharing all of this with us and it was wonderful to hear the
story.
