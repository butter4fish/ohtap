Barbara Raab: …Helen Thayer Paxton, the class of '22, she was an English major, and I
guess the first thing that you can tell me about is about wild life in the dormitories in the
early 1920s.
Helen Thayer: I don't think it was very wild. It was supposed to be gracious living
carried to the nth degree. In the dorms at that time, and there were two of them, Miller
Hall and Metcalf Hall, there were no roommates. But there were very efficient house
mothers who believed in gracious living, as I've said. And believe it or not, there were
maids to do…to clean our rooms. The only thing that was asked of us was that we pile
all of our precious papers and flotsam and jetsam on the bed and cover it with a sheet, or
whatever else we chose to cover it with. That was, of course, before 1929 when
everything changed everywhere. We loved to dance. There was a big StrombergCarlson in the living room at Miller Hall and we—some of us would actually get up early
to come down to dance before breakfast. And we'd dance before dinner; Jazz was
coming in and we were trying all kinds of steps and some of our best dancers did not
object to leading, and they were given lots of practice because we all wanted to be very,
very excellent dancers.
Some of the best of the girls—we called them Steppers—didn't object to leading at all,
and were eager and willing to teach other people, which I think was showing a lot of
public consciousness. There were five girls in Miller Hall who met for the first time on
the fourth floor when it was opened. Miller was so crowded in the fall of 1918, when my
friends and I arrived, that the maids' quarters had to be put together, sort of double
room—I mean, two people in one room for the maids, and we had about eight or nine
rooms on the fourth floor, which is near the kitchenette. So that we were not left by
ourselves by any manner or means, and one…one of the girls on the fourth floor was a
fabulous cook and at the drop of a hat, she would make excellent concoctions for
anybody. And she never had any trouble finding people to eat what she made.
We spent a lot of time visiting. We spent some of them…some of my friends, way up on
the fourth floor smoked in their closets, and also, we didn't use the fire escapes as a way
to see tennis matches down below. We used 'em as a place to sleep! In the springtime,
we would haul our single bed mattresses out on the fire escape and sleep there. Well, I

had to try it, too, but I gave it up, not because I was chicken, but because the mosquitos
liked me so much that I preferred to come back inside and be safe.
BR: The girl…you said about smoking…the girls weren’t allowed to smoke, were they?
HTP: (gasps) No. And the hats and gloves syndrome that you've heard about, well, that
was real enough, but if you worked it right, and you lived in the dorm, you could get out
without your hat and without your gloves and you could really have a very normal time.
We did seem to keep away from the Brown campus, but that—that was per order—but
we went…could go to the John Hay as much as we wanted to. And we, because we lived
in the dormitory, could go there at nighttime, because if we…if two of us got permission
from our house mother, who was strict, but sensible—and we all liked her very much,
indeed—we could go over to the John Hay two by two, and that seemed fantastic. You
couldn't do that very safely today, I would think.
BR: No, not really.
HTP: And then, when the library closed, because we all would stay 'til the bitter end,
hoping that some Brown man would have noticed our maidenly beauty and would come
over to us and say, "May I see home to your dormitory?" And lots of times we were
successful, and lots of times we came home two by two.
BR: But they weren't allowed to come inside, were they?
HTP: Not at that time of night.
BR: What about in the daytime?
HTP: Brown men were welcome in our dorms at any time of day, but they were
restricted: no above stairs.
BR: So could you…
HTP: (inaudible) they could go to living room of Miller or the living room of Metcalf
and all of us who lived in that building met Brown men, because—there, because they
had come for their own girls, and they'd chat with us as they waited.
BR: But you couldn't sneak them up to your rooms.
HTP: Never…we never even considered that. But we could have them right, I mean, as
a…that was a launching pad. Oh, and by the way, the beautiful…Metcalf Hall was new
in the fall of 1919 and it was fresh and lovely and very tastefully decorated. But the
room for the visitors, and that included the Brown men and anybody's mother, father,
relative, or whatnot, anybody who visited went into this red room. It was all red and

cream, and it was really dazzling. But it didn't take the men very long to call it "Dante's
Inferno," and they would say, "We'll meet you at the…at the Inferno."
And across from…across from Dante's Inferno was the living room, and men weren't
supposed to set foot in there, but of course, they did whenever they felt like it. That was
the place where the…where the Victrolas were. And that was the place where we danced
on the car…but on the carpet, but nobody seemed to mind. It kept us busy and happy.
The rules weren't particularly rigid. We were supposed to be on time at breakfast, and we
were supposed to be on time at other meals, too. Making breakfast was hardest of all.
BR: What time was that at?
HTP: 7:30. Most of us were put into gym classes that came way at the end of the day.
All of the day girls had to have their gym classes before we had ours, probably between 3
and 4, between 3:30 and 4:30. And it didn't give us as much time as we would have liked
for dancing before dinner. But we did manage it, because we didn't have to dress up too
elegantly at nighttime. Sunday morning breakfast was the time we were supposed to look
our best. We…the few of us who got up to breakfast tried to look decent for that meal.
But at night, we…at night, we had fun. We really did. We weren't…we didn't have
tables of all sophomores or all freshmen, we had tables of mixed classes. And I liked
that, and I think everybody else did, too. And when we were seniors, we each—three or
four of us, at least—each had a table of our own, and we were supposed to engage in
interesting conversation and, if possible, make people feel, well, that we were amusing
and that we could get them to respond and tell stories and so forth. And we took
particular care of the freshmen at night, making them part of the scene, but there were, of
course, always a certain percentage of freshmen who were apt to grab the whole scene
and use it to the exclusion of other people. As I said in the beginning, we were supposed
to be exponents of gracious living, and we tried.
BR: Do you think you succeeded?
HTP: It was very pleasant for everybody. It really was. And, of course, we were
supposed to be kind to guests, because our freshman year, the war had not ended, we
were very, very much war-oriented. Not only nationally, but internationally, because of
the visitors who came. And we dormitory people managed to get over to see as many
visitors as possible. We could go on the campus at a time like that. I remember…I,
myself, remember Cardinal Mercier's coming. I heard him speak. And Pershing
[General of the Armies John J. Pershing] visited. And there were advanced degrees given
to Marshal Foch; I think he got his ninth LL.D. from Brown, as a large crowd watched
and clapped and enjoyed seeing him. The international attitude was shown in the music
that came to Providence, particularly in the visit of Madame Schumann-Heink, who was
an object of great interest to us Pembrokers because she had sons on both sides. She had
German…sons in the German army, and she had sons fighting on the other side. Her
singing was magnificent, and we were all proud and happy that we had a chance to see it.

BR: And you got to see…you told me before, you got to see pretty much most of the
stuff that passed through Providence, music (inaudible)
HTP: Yes, we saw…we had a…because we lived in the dormitory, we could go out at
night if we could pass around the hat to pay for the ticket of an endorsed chaperone. The
house mother had to endorse her, so she wouldn't lead us astray. So that the chaperone
that we chose couldn't lead us astray, and that’s quote-unquote. All kinds of good things
came to Providence, but since I was particularly interested in music, I went to everything
I could afford and to some things I couldn't afford, and I managed to see a great…I mean,
to hear a great many…a great many musicians. I…there was the Boston Symphony
Orchestra at Infantry Hall, which is an old place that had pillars that got in your way
when you wanted to see what was happening on the stage, but I paid for my own tickets
for that, and they were student-price tickets. And I think it was at the time that
Koussevitzky was the leader.
Then Brown had a lot of music, and I got to that, too. I…I think through somebody's
brother. And Brown had its musical clubs, combined musical clubs, and there was a
young man named Bob Baldridge who was the leader of the Brown Orchestra, and he
was a superlative violinist, who later became a very fine surgeon at the Rhode Island
Hospital. And the brother of one of my friends was a first violin in the Brown Orchestra.
And by hook or by crook, I got myself to anything musical I could possibly go to.
Then as we made the rounds, as we did in the dorm because we made blind dates for
people, we got to various fraternity houses that were interested in music. And the one
that I went to most often was the Zeta Psi, which had its own little music halls. They
were very good, indeed, because they had brought in alumni and other interested people,
and we were fortunate enough—by "we," I mean the group of us on the fourth floor—we
were fortunate enough to be invited by some man or other. Anyway, we got there.
BR: Did you do everything, pretty much, with these people? The—what'd you call
them?—The Gang?
HTP: We called ourselves Les Girls. (Laughter) That's exactly what we were. Well, we
did…one of them had the brother who played the first violin in the Orchestra. And
another one had a…a brother who was a Zeta Psi, and through her, we got invitations.
They knew I liked music, so I was invited fairly often. And certainly every time there
was a musical program. And they were very good programs. One of the girls on the
fourth floor was a…a very talented pianist, and she became the accompanist for the
whole college. And of course, she…and she had the brother who was the violinist, and
through her, I got to all sorts of piano evenings. This is theater evenings. And I made a
little list here of the people that I heard. This is during my first two years: Percy
Grainger, Heifetz Rachmaninoff, Madame Schumann-Heink, Madame [Euritza?], and
John McCormack, and there's somebody that I have left out, and…probably two or three
I have left out. But those are the outstanding ones. It was a real—for me—a real course
in music, because I didn't have time to take it at Pembroke until the last half of my senior
year, when I took a formal music course with a professor called Gene Weir.

Now that, having the interest in the music was a focal point for me, aside from my great
passion, which was English. Because this little group of ours had in it…everyone in it
was interested in English. And that was something of a marvel, because we never laid
eyes on each other before we came to Pembroke. And we were not…we not only took
courses open to everybody, but all of us were admitted to a graduate course in Professor
Bronson's English. And we were only juniors, but we survived it and passed the course
with flying colors, and it was one of the great landmarks of our study at Brown.
Then downtown, we got the advantage of very much better plays that came to Providence
for a long time. There were…big names came to Providence. And all we had to do was
to pass around the hat, as I said, and get the chaperone, unless we were lucky enough to
be invited by men, when we were free to go, once the house mother had given…put the
stamp of approval on him. He had to meet her, go in and meet her rather formally, and
some of them didn't like it, particularly. And once she knew his name and had him
pigeonholed in her mind, you said, "I want to go to [Southern and Marlow?] to see
Hamlet with X from the Brown campus." She would say, "Oh yes, yes, I remember him,
a very fine young man, yes, that will be good."
BR: This is Dean King?
HTP: No. This was our house mother, in the dormitory.
BR: Did you ever have a date turned down, I mean, not approved?
HTP: No, I was foxy. (Laughter) I invited people, I mean, I accepted people that I knew
she would okay.
BR: Oh.
HTP: There are ways and ways and ways.
BR: You sound like you knew how to beat the system. (Laughter)
HTP: Well, no I stayed within it, but I got around it. I guess that's beating it, isn't it?
BR: Yeah.
HTP: I guess so.
BR: Sleeping out on the fire escape.
HTP: Oh, sleeping on the fire escape. Well, some of the…some of the girls in this group
did smoke in their clothes closets…
BR: Did you do that?

HTP: No! I didn't care anything about smoking, and one thing you can say about me, I
was not responsive to public opinion. If I didn't want to smoke, I didn't smoke. If my
friends wanted to smoke, alright. I wasn't on any committees at that point, where I had to
live up to everything that I accepted. As a committee member, if they wanted to smoke, I
didn't tattle on them, but I didn't do it if I didn't want to. And anything else they did,
because some of the things they did were very off-beat and they didn't…I sound like a
prude! But I am somebody, and was, as a girl, somebody who didn't care what other
people thought. You know, if I didn't want to do it, I wouldn't do it, not because this tribe
was going off the deep end.
BR: What about when you became president of the student government? Did you have
to turn your friends in?
HTP: Oh, I was ver…no, no. No, because they didn't cheat. That was the big thing, you
were supposed…oh, no, the house. No! You're pretty foxy! Over in Pembroke Hall, I
was student government president for the whole group of girls. And what I did there was
to keep quiet in the corridors, to…oh, just be helpful in every possible way, but my
friends—I'm telling you—they didn't cheat. In the first place, they didn't need to. They
had a big endowment of brains per person. But they wouldn't have done it. They
wouldn't have been good friends of mine if they cheated like that, I mean I wouldn't have
been interested in…
BR: Did you have to "politic" to be student government president?
HTP: Well, they were my claque. They went around getting votes for me.
BR: So, you had them all working for you? (Laughter)
HTP: All that group, yes. Of course.
BR: Did you stand around and shake hands on the corner of…
HTP: No, no, I didn't do that, but, I mean, they…they certainly got the two dorms
alerted. "Vote for Helen! Remember, she's the Dorm Girl! Come on, come on," that sort
of thing.
BR: Do you remember who you had to run against?
HTP: I haven't the faintest idea.
BR: So you must have been pretty popular.
HTP: Well, I looked old for my age, and it thought that looking mature meant that I had
some brains, and I certainly didn't. But I did know how to keep my mouth shut, and also,
to be honest. I think if I had stood for something…if I had stood up in Pembroke Hall

and talked about this and that and not cheating, and all that sort of thing, and then had
done it myself, or had been found in Mrs. Green's coffee house which was really
something and some of my friends went there.
BR: Where was that?
HTP: Downtown.
BR: How come you couldn't go there?
HTP: It wasn't nice.
BR: The place wasn't nice?
HTP: Well, it was really off-bounds. You wouldn't recommend it to your own daughter.
Or maybe you would today; I don't know.
BR: But some people went anyway?
HTP: Oh, sure, some of my friends went. But I never knew about it. They kept it from
me 'til afterwards.
BR: Well, what was the attraction of going?
HTP: Men. There were men there.
BR: Ooooooh! (Laughter)
HTP: Lounges and dim lights and all that sort of thing. I mean, I wouldn't have done
that sort of thing when I was trying to stand for something decent. I think…I remember
telling that to a boy at the private school where I worked so many years, I said, "You
should resign from the class presidency! What you stand for is…is not what we want
here." And he was very angry, and I didn't care, because I think if you take a job like
that, you have to take the responsibilities that go with it. Or give it up. If you want to be
a free lance, and do anything you want to, don't take the plaudits of the group for
standing…for taking a job of that kind. Unless you're going to follow it up.
Well, I…my friends used to say, "This is Helen, our student government president, but
we love her just the same." Which gives you a little idea.
Now, let's see…about the fire escape. Well, I read in Miss [Caulks's?] book that the fire
escape was used in her day, which was before the 1920s. That they…girls sat out there,
very circumspectly, and watched tennis games, it was kind of like a bleachers for the
tennis games. But what we did in our time, was to drag out our single mattresses and
sleep out there. But I soon gave that up, not because it was illegal; I liked the fresh air.

BR: It was illegal, wasn't it?
HTP: Oh, yes! Pembroke girls sleeping out where men in the street could look…look up
and see them in their deshabille? Yes, it was very illegal. Well, I did it two or three
times. This was before I had…held any offices. You see?
BR: You're still clean.
HTP: I could still do pretty much what I wanted to without feeling qualms of conscience.
But the mosquitos took care of me; they ate me alive! On every night that I slept out
there, and so, I gave that up. I think my husband, I mean, the man I met halfway
through…the end of my sophomore year, I think he used to give cigars to the watchmen
who let us in at night. We couldn't have our own keys! My daughter, years later, at
Radcliffe could have her own key to come and go to her dorm when she went out with
men, but I couldn't have mine…the watchmen had to let me in.
BR: What time did you have to…?
HTP: 12:30. Except on a prom night, or a Senior-Sophomore Ball, or some big campus
bash, where you could stay out 'til three or four, or something like that.
BR: So, could…if you didn't come in, did someone know? The house mother?
HTP: Oh, my dear! The watchmen had your name, and as he let you in, he noted the
time that you arrived, and he opened the door for you. And saw you safely inside and
walked down the front steps with your young man. You see, there was no margin for
error, whatsoever.
BR: So why did your…
HTP: So my…the man I married got the idea that…he loved…my boyfriend loved to
smoke, absolutely. He'd smoke and smoke and smoke and smoke. And he decided that
the watchman might like cigars. And so he would come provided, and what…what
would happen—of course, I didn't know anything about this—of course, I did, but I…I
mean, technically I didn't—he would give out the cigars, and then the watchman would
forget to put…put down the time that we'd gotten there.
BR: Which was what?
HTP: Later than…the house mother had expected. But that's as far as I ever went
on…trying to…well, I didn't do it, you see. Did I?
BR: No, you didn't.
HTP: No, he did it. He brought the cigars. There was one other thing that the girls, and
not only our little group, but the whole of Miller, whenever it felt like it—this is my

freshman year, when I lived in Miller—knew how to put a brick in the back door that
lead to Cushing Street, and go down. This would be late at night with a coat over your
nightgown. Go down to Reiner's drug store and what is known as re…reinforcements.
BR: (Overlapping dialogue, inaudible question)
HTP: Food! Candy! Anything. Because the store on the corner that had the Danishes
and things that we got for breakfasts when we missed breakfast in the dining room,
weren't available late at night, 'cause that store closed. But Reiner's was open very late,
and you could…I don't think anybody ever got caught, because the brick would hold. I
was tempted to do it a couple of times…then wait to let my friends in after they got very
excited, but…I don't think anybody ever got caught with that. I think it was…I think of it
today, it would be dangerous today. Absolutely taking your life in your hands! It was as
safe as a milk (inaudible) then. Some things are much worse today, and some things are
much better. Yeah. I believe in more freedom. But within our…within our framework,
we had a very good time.
BR: But you'd like to go and do it again? Today?
HTP: No, I would like to try today's…
BR: That's what I mean.
HTP: Oh, yes.
BR: What do you think you'd be like?
HTP: I think I would have a very good time. I really think I would. I would have
enjoyed the…more freedom.
BR: What would you have done with it?
HTP: Well, I would have gone more places with more men.
BR: With more men all at the same time? You and six men going someplace at the same
time?
HTP: No, but…stop pulling my leg! (Laughter) But I think some of the things that are
done today by Pembrokers are good. I'm sorry I never had a chance to try them out. And
by that, I mean—I'm going to be explicit about this—some of the organizations that you
have with men, it's good to be in contact with men for…well, I mean…I was going to say
uprisings. But I mean getting together to try to do something about very, very bad things
in our present day social make-up. We didn't…we saw men only socially. I don't
remember working with any men in my last two years at Brown, for any…what I would
call a cause. And I believe in that. And I believe in knowing what goes on in the man's
mind. Both of my daughters went all of their lives to…all their academic lives…to

women's…I mean girls' schools. Prep schools. And one of them complained bitterly that
she never knew what…what went on inside the men's' heads. The boys came to the
house with flowers and things and took them out all the time, but they never saw them
when they weren't all dressed up and all that sort of thing. And they felt cheated, and
they wanted to drop their girls' school and go to Hope High. And we said, "No. Pick a
college with plenty of men in them and get to know them then." I…I…we realized what
they were talking about. And I never knew what young men students…I just went on
dates with them. Who knew what they thought, or what made them tick, or what they
were willing to work for…what they cared about? The ones who liked music, I spotted.
I mean that's for me, a universal thing. But…no.
All the teas, and meetings at church…Central Congregational Church had very good five
o'clock on Sunday meetings for young Brown and Pembroke people. And we liked that;
we went to that. We made a tour of the city, trying the churches. I made a tour of the
city churches on my own, hunting for the best organ. And it was at Central
Congregational Church, and I still go there. And their organ is absolutely wonderful.
Today, it's a new one from when I was there.
Do you see how the music helped me focus?
BR: Mm-hmm.
HTP: Music and men and books, I mean, those are my focal points, and this group of
friends.
BR: I can turn this over.

Track 2

BR: Okay.
HTP: During my four years in Pembroke, I had to work. Every year, I worked every
summer, I worked every vacation. I think one of the reasons that I was fairly circumspect
was that my parents were giving up a great deal to let me live in the dormitory in the first
place, because I could have been a carpetbagger, and I could have come in every day on
the trolley from North Smithfield. And I felt it was a privilege to live in the dorm, and I
wanted to, at least, do my part when my parents were giving up a great deal to send me
there.
My first job, my freshman year was a stint in the Pembroke Library, 15 hours a week, and
it was very demanding, and the librarian let me do more and more things because I had
worked in a library before. And I found it was taking more than 15 hours, then there was
all the business of keeping discipline in the library—it's no wonder I became adept in
keeping people quiet, but it certainly wasn't easy. It was a strain as a matter of fact. And

at the end of my freshman year, my father said, "We've had enough of that. We'll find
the money so you don't have to put in so many hours." Well, I had to find another job.
And here again, I had very, very good fortune, because I put my name in at the Pembroke
office to try to get babysitting jobs on the East Side. After all, I could walk to most of
them, and I certainly was right nearby people who had the money and who wanted people
to care for their…to take their little children walking afternoons, and I also could do
babysitting at night, if I were luck…if I happened to be lucky enough to get the job. So I
took that over. And that lead me to some of the most…the pleasantest times I had at
Pembroke, because the woman for whom I worked was a professional singer. And she
liked me, and invited me to her house whenever she had an evening of piano, or voice, or
whatnot. That would be socially, and in the meantime, I was her very, very faithful
caretaker for her little son, who wasn't much trouble, but still you had to watch it. As you
do, taking care of any child.
Well after I met a young man that I liked very much indeed, I found that that consumed
too much time. So I went to the Pembroke office and I said, "What do you have for me
now? That won't take me off the campus?" You see, I was thinking of the Dante's
Inferno and entertaining there while I worked. And said, "I've got—you're reliable—I've
got just the thing for you. How would you like to answer the phone?" Because there
were no extensions, and the person…the girl who answered the phone and the door had
to run up and down stairs, up to the fourth floor, you see. And there were some very
popular people on the fourth floor.
BR: That was your floor.
HTP: Well, that had been. No, it wasn't my floor at Metcalf, but it was…there were
some very, very popular people up there. And so I took that job, and I kept that until I
graduated. And it…oh, I could do studying in the Inferno. And I could…my friend—so,
narrowed down to one very good friend—could come visit me there. Sometimes we
studied there. Sometimes, if he thought I was too tired, he would call me up to keep the
phone tied up so I wouldn't have to go up to the fourth floor! Or the third floor, or the
second floor, getting people to come down. That was his idea.
BR: So you really did know how to beat the system, didn't you, and still stay within it?
HTP: Yes! I didn't cheat. He called me; I didn't ever call him.
BR: Oh, I know what I can ask you about: you said you played on the basketball team.
HTP: Oh, yes. I was a…I had been a varsity basketball player in high school and I was
looking forward to being on the varsity at Pembroke. But I wasn't fast enough. I was a
good center-center; we were called then. You know how they were divided, don't you?
BR: No.

HTP: The center-center, 'cause I'm tall, I was that. And two side-centers and then two
guards. And you stayed within that…
BR: Zone.
HTP: … denomination or zone or what have you. But I wasn't good enough. There
were too many people in my class, mostly among the day girls, they were the good
athletes. There were more to choose from, you see. There were many more day girls
than dormitory girls at Pembroke at that time. And so I was a substitute for the varsity,
and I went with all…with the team on all of their trips. We played Wheaton, Rhode
Island University women's section down there. They were fun trips. I enjoyed it all very
much. Once in a while, I had a chance to play. Enough so that I stayed on the…I would
call it today the squad. And I liked that, and it was…later on, I was glad I had gone to
Pembroke…I mean to Wheaton, because one of my daughters thought she would go there
and I had liked it so much when I visited that we took her there, but she took one look at
Wheaton and said, "No men! I'm not going to go there!" And she didn't.
By the way, my two daughters who felt so thwarted in having no men—boys—in their
classes at private school where they went…one went to Radcliffe. At the time, Harvard
was combining because of the World War II.
BR: Right.
HTP: Yeah. And the other one went to Pembroke. Where there were plenty of men.
And she saw plenty of them, too. I don't mean a lot, but they…they were around as they
hadn't been in my day.
BR: Popular just like her mother, huh?
HTP: No, she wasn't at all. I don't know…she had a very unhappy time, very unhappy
love affair. It was really grim. But it's all…it all cleared up in time. No, she didn't. She
dropped out.
BR: Out of where?
HTP: Pembroke.
BR: So she didn't graduate.
HTP: No. She never wanted to come back. But it wasn't Pembroke's fault, as she would
admit. It was her private life which was really grim at that time. That's the way it
happens for some people.
BR: That's right.

HTP: For me, it was a joyous experience. For her, it was a grim one. Except for her
work for the Brown Christian Association, where she was…acted as a un—practically—
an unpaid secretary. She typed for them; she did everything for them. She brought
foreign students home for me to feed and be nice to. I mean, she made a life for herself,
but it wasn't a particularly happy one. Not the way mine had been. So I'm lucky in that
respect. I guess that's about it.
(Tape stops.)
BR: Okay, you wanted to tell me one more…
HTP: Yes. One of the amusing things that happened when I was at Pembroke was the
propensity of some of the freshmen—I must have been an upper classman by then—to
call attention to themselves by becoming real flappers. They wore the old-fashioned kind
of overshoes with the…what do you call those things where they click together?
BR: Oh, I don't know…
HTP: Well, anyway, they wore their overshoes like men's overshoes in those days, wide
open, and they clopped and flapped and…they were called flappers. But that wasn't
enough. They had to call attention to—they were getting very modern—call attention to
themselves even more. And so two or three of them had raccoon coats that were big and
shaggy and…noticeable. And with the raccoon coats, they wore leghorn hats. And it
became one of the joys of our campus life to have the rac…the leghorn hats disappear, as
they did from time to time, and then they would reappear and be worn again. It was silly
and Sophomorish, but very amusing, we thought.
No, the kind of overshoes had buckles…
BR: Right, buckles.
HTP: …all the way up and they left them unbuckled. And I don't know, we had snowy
winters for those two winters. And they clomped around in the snow with the…the
overshoes flapping. I thought you might have heard of that because it was in cartoons
and magazines, and so forth.
You want to turn it off (inaudible)
(Tape stops.)
HTP: I can think of one more custom, which I liked, because I like music. At Metcalf
Hall, before Christmastime, just before…the night before the day that we went home at
Christmastime, we would…upper classmen would appear in their nightgowns with their
hair hanging, and of course everybody had long hair. Long, perilous hair, as my
boyfriend used to say. I believe it came off on his coat or something. They would march

around the corridors of Metcalf Hall, singing beautifully Christmas carols. That was a
lovely custom.
And when we first went to Metcalf Hall, all of the…the mixture of classes that had been
chosen for the privilege of going to that new building. In the little slot on your door for
your calling card! I didn't have any; I was too poor. But everybody else did. When we
went…first went in, our first, first overnight there, we found in our doors a name for each
girl, and the name was chosen from some heroine from English literature. Two upper
classmen had done this for everybody. And I took a look at the name on my door, and
I…I was majoring in English. I was planning to, anyway, I was a sophomore. I didn't
know who the heroine was, and I was very chagrinned. Well, she was Eustacia Vye, and
it didn't take me long to get The Return of the Native and…and to read it. And I wasn't
sure she was a wholesome character, but that's what they put on my door.
I think that's it.
