Aaron Cusick:      So what was the, maybe, motivation that led you to get involved with so many different organizations or networks.  
Wanda Floyd: 
     I think part of it was in talking to other African Americans, and realizing that they couldn&#8217;t do what I was doing. I felt there needed to be some representation somewhere. Because you know, living in the Triangle area, most of the--you know, you go to Gay Pride, and you see mainly European Americans. When you see activism, it&#8217;s mainly European Americans, unless there&#8217;s something targeting African Americans. Most of the groups, and most of the organizations that were around, at least in the early days, when I first got involved in the 90s, were predominantly white. And I knew that if somebody didn&#8217;t do it, we wouldn&#8217;t--our voice wouldn&#8217;t be heard. And so a lot of the motivation was the fact that it didn&#8217;t matter to me who knew I was gay. It didn&#8217;t matter to me, I didn&#8217;t have much to lose, I still don&#8217;t have a lot to lose now. But I knew a lot of African Americans who were doctors, and lawyers, and police officers, and mothers, and fathers who could not do the things that I did. And would thank me later for being, you know, they tell you that &#8220;I wish I could be out there with you, but I can&#8217;t because I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to lose my kids or I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to lose my job.&#8221; And those kind of things never really bothered me, and I think that came from having such a strong sense of faith growing up, and a pastor, who never preached condemnation. I&#8217;m sure he did, most pastors do at some point in time, but I never heard it. And I think I was shielded from that in a lot of ways, and so I felt very blessed to have been brought up the way I was. And I think that this gave me the motivation, that even now it really doesn&#8217;t bother me who knows I am and who doesn&#8217;t know. I can go--I was at HRC banquet couple of weeks ago, probably one of, I&#8217;ll say a good twenty-five of us were people of color. That&#8217;s being very gracious. Out of about seven hundred people. And I was you know--even got a picture of David Bromstad from HGTV. [Laughter] You see, it&#8217;s on my screen saver. And it&#8217;s got nothing to do with what we&#8217;re talking about, but there he is.  
AC: 
Oh wow.  
WF: 
For HGTV. I actually met him. I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so giddy.&#8221; He says, &#8220;That&#8217;s okay.&#8221; I&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;   
AC:
So would you say that the African American community is less accepting of homosexuality?  
WF: 
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. And yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.  
AC:
And could--I mean, is that something religion-based or is there other elements to that?   
WF:
Yes. Yes. Well, yes it is. A lot of it has to do with our faith. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that sexuality is not something that&#8217;s talked about a lot in the African American community. What happens in the house stays in the house. And it&#8217;s not put out on the street. I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of reading, a lot of studying in school, because I&#8217;m working on my M.Div. at Shaw Divinity School, which is a historically black college-university. And just doing a lot of reading in connection to slavery and stuff like that. And a lot of our body image and things like that, happened and occurred and began then, and still isn&#8217;t--is evident now, and just how men and women, African American men and women, treat our bodies, and whatnot. And so I think a lot of it is deeply-rooted within us. And that the black man is to be the backbone of the family, even though we know most times it&#8217;s the black woman. But the black man is to be the provider for the family, and yet when he discovers that he has feelings, that are not for women, but for men, a lot of them are ostracized. I mean, I&#8217;ve known guys who&#8217;ve gotten beat up
by their friends. I&#8217;ve known kids who have been thrown out of the house, at fifteen and sixteen years old, because they came out to their parents. I knew someone who was raped by her father because she said she that was a lesbian, and he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna teach you something.&#8221; And he raped her, and gave her STD. She was able to get rid of it, but those kind of things, I have heard and experienced in the African American community growing up. And that scares me, and I think even now, we have come a lot further than we were years ago, but we&#8217;re still not there yet. When I was--my partner and I at the time, we&#8217;re not together now, but at one point we were asked to come to D.C. for an HRC thing. This was when marriage equality was really big. And New York post was doing like these ads once a week, or once a whatever it is. And the call that went across nation-wide for an African American couple, that was willing to be photographed, that was willing to have their story told on TV and be interviewed, and sit before Congress. And they couldn&#8217;t find anybody.  
AC: 
That was willing?  
WF:
That was willing to do it. And so we said &#8220;Sure, we&#8217;ll do it. No problem.&#8221; And we were--had a big ad in the paper and everything for HRC. And so the stigma is still there, and it saddens me that the stigma is there, but we are, you know, we&#8217;re groups like the National Black Justice Coalition working strongly with communities of faith, especially. Because communities of faith that, I think, has the strongest hold on the African American community. Because that&#8217;s where we started, we started with the church, and slavery, and that&#8217;s just been a part of who we are ever since. And I think that&#8217;s the place where, if we&#8217;re going to make any kind of changes, that&#8217;s where the changes need to happen at, it&#8217;s in those places.  
AC: 
And do you feel or have you ever felt any pressure to define yourself in terms of one identity, whether African American or lesbian or multiple, conflicting feelings?  
WF:
Ah. . . No, I get more pressure within the gay community to identify either as butch or femme, which I don&#8217;t ascribe to, and I don&#8217;t understand that, but I mean I understand it, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary to be put in a box in that way. I just am who I am. It&#8217;s--I&#8217;ve only come out like once or twice at school, and most people I come out to at school have been okay, because in the environment that I&#8217;ve come out in. But for the most part, I have not recently found myself having to put myself in a box or allow others to do that to me. I don&#8217;t know.  
AC: 
And do you feel that the general LGBT community is accepting of African Americans?  
WF: 
[Pause] Long pause. Let&#8217;s see. [Pause] I&#8217;m not really sure how to answer that question, only because of the fact that I think there is a--the stigma is still there. And there are still people who are not accepting of African Americans to begin with, who are white, first of all. And then when you add the gay piece on to that, sometimes, it can be very challenging. I think it has gotten better over the years, and I think people are beginning to recognize the need to be open to all races when it comes to organizations and when it comes to trying to organize groups. There are still times that, you know, racism is racism. Excuse me. It has more to do with racism than it has to do with sexuality, sometimes. I think I deal more with the racism piece than I do with the sexuality piece when it comes to European Americans.  
AC: 
And how would you describe the LGBT community in the Triangle?  
WF:
Ooh. Segmented. It&#8217;s--we have our own--we have our various uh--  
AC:
Cliques?   
WF: 
Yeah. I was trying not to use that word. [Laughter] I was trying not to use that word. Segregated. Cliques. Yeah, there are various cliques, and I think it&#8217;s very challenging at times to fit in. I--  
AC:
Within one&#8217;s own group or--  
WF: 
Yeah, yeah. One of the things that I often say, I think I&#8217;ve been quoted in the paper as saying, is that sometimes I feel like I&#8217;m too out for the black community, and too black for the white community. And so there are times in which I feel like I walk this very fine line between the two groups. I think overall now, what I see happening, is organizations are finally, you know, not apologizing for being who they are. In that if this is who I am, this is who I am. And, you know, Imani MCC, the church I founded was not intentionally founded for the African American community, but as time went on, that was the population that came mostly. And for whatever reason, I don&#8217;t know, but no one in the leadership wanted that to be just the case, and so we were very deliberate and intentional in making sure we did other things. Because at one point we were very heavily African American female, and so we intentionally started playing softball, which we understood that white lesbians really like to do. And it worked. [Laughter] It worked. It opened doors. And we intentionally had started men&#8217;s groups. And so I think, that when you--you&#8217;re at a place where you realize that you&#8217;re not the only game in town, and you want to make sure that people know that you&#8217;re not just this group of people, you have to be very intentional and deliberate about doing something different. And I don&#8217;t see that happening across the board. I don&#8217;t see that kind of intentional reaching out across the gay and lesbian communities in this area.    [37:48]  

AC:     So could you talk more about your involvement with marriage equality?  

WF:    Been involved in that with Jack McKinney, who used to be the pastor over at Pullen for many years. Chantelle Fisher-Borne was on the committee. She was the one that brought us all together. Jimmy Creech and Mary Grigolia, who used to be on staff at Eno River Unitarian Universal Fellowship. And we work with Equality North Carolina. At times we've had press releases in connection with marriage equality, we&#8217;ve had a couple of rallies downtown in front of Congress [North Carolina General Assembly]. I think two or three of them. We&#8217;ve been downtown before. And we are one of the grassroots groups that has kept the amendment from going to Congress--I mean we&#8217;re one of the few states in the South in which there&#8217;s nothing on the books yet about marriage equality. And I think our work with Equality North Carolina, as well as some other grassroots groups in the state have kept that from happening. And so for us, part of what we did was we would go and visit different cities, and talk about marriage equality and try and help them get a group started. And the one group actually that has really taken off was in Asheville. I can&#8217;t remember the name of that group, but they have a very strong faith group there in connection to marriage equality. I think Mahan Siler, that used to be the pastor at Pullen, is very heavily involved in that, as well as some other people. And so, right now we&#8217;re on hiatus because there&#8217;s not a whole lot going on with marriage equality, and we are looking at putting a lot of our support right now behind Ian at Equality North Carolina.  

AC:
And do you feel any, I don&#8217;t know if conflict is the right word, but any anything about being involved both in like sort of spiritual matters and political matters? Is there any issue with that for you?  

WF: 
Spirituality is political.   

AC: 
Could you expand on that?  

WF: 
In the sense of, you know, it&#8217;s, I think you can&#8217;t, if you are a spiritual-religious person, you have to be political because politics is about justice. And to me that&#8217;s what Jesus was about. Jesus was about justice. And so you can&#8217;t be a spiritual person and not be involved with social justice issues. And to me marriage equality is a social justice issue, it&#8217;s not about man and woman, it&#8217;s about justice, period. I mean that&#8217;s one of the things we were able to get the North Carolina Council of Churches behind us on, in the sense of not necessarily they are for gay and lesbian marriage equality, but they are for justice. And that was how we got them involved in this whole fight as well. And so for me it&#8217;s not an either-or, it&#8217;s a both-and. And it truly has to--you have to be involved in social justice somewhere, in some form or another if you consider yourself a follower of Christ. Period. But that&#8217;s just my opinion, not everybody agree with that, but that&#8217;s just where I come from.  

AC: 
And growing up or in your adult life, were you very aware of the civil rights movement and the gay rights and women&#8217;s movements?  
WF:
To some extent, not a whole lot. I think I became more aware of it as I got into college and as I read more about it, and I know a lot of people would compare civil rights to gay and lesbian rights, and for me they&#8217;re--it&#8217;s just about human rights. I think Civil Rights at the time was about one particular thing, and I think that gay and lesbian rights now are about something else. So for me I can&#8217;t equate the two, because I think it&#8217;s two different entities happening at two different times. The civil rights movement was about civil rights at that time, what they needed, you know better paying jobs, equality for everybody, and gay and lesbian rights is something totally different now. Now were there gay people involved in the civil rights movement? Of course. I mean, you know, Martin Luther King&#8217;s right-hand man was a gay black man. Whether he acknowledged him, most of the time or not, and even now are there some elements of civil rights as part of gay and lesbian community movement? Of course there are. And because I think there&#8217;s both-and, but they&#8217;re two different, they&#8217;re very--totally two different things. And I think we all do a disservice to the civil rights movement and to the gay and lesbian movement when we try and equate the two as same, but they&#8217;re two different things, totally different things.  
AC: 
So what was sort of the first political activism that you were a part of. Was that--would that have been in college or after college?  
WF:
I--what&#8217;s your definition of that?  
AC: 
Well I mean, like you know, the HRC or marriage equality or something act--  
WF:
I guess it would be, nothing in college, I guess it would have to be probably HRC when we went up to D.C. we did go visit David Price, our representative at the time. Went and talked to him about marriage equality. And we did sit in on the Congr--we didn&#8217;t speak before Congress--but we were there, and it&#8217;s in public record that we were there. So I think that was probably the first big, out thing that I was involved in as far as politically was concerned. We&#8217;d done a couple of rallies at Congress [North Carolina General Assembly] before that, but I think, you know, that was more local than anything else. And this--the HRC thing, and going to D.C. was probably the biggest thing. Yeah.  
AC: 
And what were your feelings or emotions going into that situation in D.C.?  
WF: 
It was a little scary, because we weren&#8217;t sure what to expect. And we knew that our lives would be out there and we had to really think about it, and we only had a day to think about it. So we had to really understand what the ramifications this could be across the country. And again it came down to knowing that we were in the church at the time with people who, they could never do this. And it stopped being, &#8220;Why us?&#8221; to become a &#8220;Why not us?&#8221; or &#8220;Why me?&#8221; to &#8220;Why not me?&#8221; And not in a selfish kind of way, but in fact in a recognizing that somebody has to do it, and there&#8217;s too many people who have so much to lose. And not that I don&#8217;t have a lot to lose. I think I do. But I think the things that you put value on, I don&#8217;t necessarily have--both my parents have passed. My job is such that they know I&#8217;m out at my job, it&#8217;s not an issue being out there because I don&#8217;t bring who I am into my job, I do my work. Church-wise, that&#8217;s cool. And so the things that people--I don&#8217;t have any kids--feel that they&#8217;ll lose, I don&#8217;t have that issue with. So I&#8217;ve never felt afraid to stand up. I think I&#8217;ve only been called &#8220;dyke&#8221; once, and that was yelled out of a car. And I&#8217;ve only--I think there&#8217;s only been one time in my life that I felt threatened. And that was when I was part of a town hall meeting on marriage equality at St. John&#8217;s MCC, before I came back there, years ago, and there was a group of people there from another church. Mainly black men, who--the pastor had called me, he was a friend of mine--had called me and told me they were going to be there. And I said okay. And--  
AC: 
And were these heterosexual men?  
WF: 
Sure, we&#8217;ll go with that.   
AC: 
Okay. [Laughter]  
WF: 
We will claim that they were, sure. Why not? And when I got there, there was a whole panel of us to speak. There was a guy from Lamda Legal from D.C.; Jo Wyrick from HRC; Ian Palmquist from Equality North Carolina; Stan Kimer from the IBM diversity chairperson; I represented the faith community and also co-chair of the Marriage Equality Coalition, and seems like there was one other person, like six or seven of us on the panel. Maybe that was it, might&#8217;ve been just six of us. And I was the last one to speak. And this was also the year that, it was during Lent, and this was the year that The Passion of the Christ came out. And so I&#8217;m sitting there, and the first thing I said was, I was not there to debate Scripture. And when I said that the place erupted. I mean it got upset--it got to the point where they actually had to call the cops. And I didn&#8217;t know this till later on, the cops were actually sitting out in the parking lot. And I stayed until the last person left. And never have I felt so afraid because they were calling--they were like saying I was a disgrace to the black race, take my collar, you know, take my collar out. Because usually in environments like that, anytime I had to go out in public I always dressed the part: I had on all black with the clergy collar on, so nobody--there was no mistaking who I was. And that&#8217;s how I dressed this particular night. And it really scared me, and it was also the same night that they had the issue about domestic partnership being voted on at the UNC council in Chapel Hill [Chapel Hill Town Council, March 24, 2004]. And what was interesting about all that is, most of the press was there, there was one press person at St. John&#8217;s MCC, which is where all the--which is where everything erupted. [Laughter] I mean at one point, they were like, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to shut this down.&#8221;
